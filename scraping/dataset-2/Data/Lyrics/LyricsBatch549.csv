Khalid,"Are we better off believing
What the ignorance suggests?
I wish living life was easy (life was easy, yeah)
But mine has been a mess
They say it comes with the seasons, mhm
But the seasons comes and go, they go
I go blurry when I'm thinking
Is it me or vertigo?

Criticized, who am I to give up?
And breathing, what's the reason to let up
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite record on

Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? (Riding this, riding in this)
Or are we dreaming? (Riding this, riding in this)
After the ride
Are you leaving? (Riding this, riding in this)

I've been better off than broken
I've been battered, I've been beat
I wish I was more outspoken
But the words are out of reach
Hmm, thought I loved you in the moment
I was happy, I was not
I've been learning, I've been growing
But the worst is yet to come

Criticized, who am I to give up?
Breathing, what's the reason to let up
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite record on

Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? (Riding this, riding in this)
Or are we dreaming? (Riding this, riding in this)
After the ride
Are you leaving? (Riding this, riding in this)

Khalid,"You say I'm trippin', bullshit
You're the one to make me do shit
You're the one to make me feel it
The feeling of stupid
I was in your corner
When you were putting me through shit
Now you wanna leave
No, you leaving me was foolish

You left me this scar on my heart
And I left you a brand new car
How nice of you, the price of true love
True love is absolute

So what more can I say?
You make me this way
What more can I say?
You make me this way

Yeah, all of these excuses
Say I'm the one that made you ruthless
But you're the reason I'm crazy
And with you I feel useless
I let you have it
You took me for granted
Always wanna play the victim
When they don't know the truth is

You left me this scar on my heart
When I'd never take it that far (oh)
Why would you say that it was true love
If true love is absolute, what more can I say?

What more can I say?
You make me this way
(You make me this way)
What more can I say?
(What can I say?)
You make me this way

I tried to stay the night
You won't let me inside
Oh, you push me away
You'll never change
Just another fight
Between you and your pride
Oh, what more can I say?
What more can I?

What more can I say? (Say)
You make me this way
You make me this way
What more can I say?
What more?
You make me this way (way)

Khalid,"Oh, oh, oh, oh
In the back of my mind I know it's hard on us
But to tell you the truth there's no more love, no more love
It's not easy to say I'm giving up
And I've been losing count

When the seconds turn to minutes into hours
You've been working 9 to 5
So it was hard to find the time for me, yeah
Are we gonna be alright
If I come through tonight

Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, I'm down to hide
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while

All the shit that you say, do you mean it?
And when you tell me you love me do you believe it?
I can see it in your eyes you've had enough of it
And I've been missing out

When the seconds turn to minutes into hours
Working 9 to 5 'cause it's hard to find the time for me, yeah
Are we gonna be alright
If I come through tonight, yeah

Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving
Let me inside, I'm down to hide

Khalid,"Comme si je n'existais pas
Elle est passée a cote de moi
Sans un regard, reine de Saba
J'ai dit Aicha, prends, tout est pour toi

Voici des perles, des bijoux
Aussi l'or autour de ton cou
Les fruits bien murs au gout de miel
Ma vie, Aicha, si tu m'aimes

J'irai a ton souffle nous mènent
Dans les pays d'ivoire et d'ébène
J'effacerai tes larmes, tes peines

Ooh! Aicha, Aicha, écoute-moi

Aicha, Aicha, regarde-moi
Aicha, Aicha, reponds-moi

Je jouerai les musiques du ciel
Je prendrai les rayons du soleil
Pour éclairer tes yeux de reine

Ooh! Aicha, Aicha, écoute-moi
Aicha, Aicha, t'en vas pas

Elle a dit, ""Garde tes trésors
Moi, je veux mieux que tout ça
Des barreaux sont des barreaux, même en or
Je veux les mêmes droits que toi
Et du respect pour chaque jour
Moi, je ne veux que de l'amour""

هجروا منك ناس شطارى
قعدوا في الغربه حيارى

Khalid,"[Littles]
I knew this chick by the name of Vevorine
Who introduced me to the streets and put me on to the game
We did in the rain, on the hood of a Range
But Vevorine, had a special friend called Heroin
She told me, that's how she met Ray Charles and Marvin Gaye
But back then, I ain't gon' front, I was peddling 'caine
In the, form of crack, she said that was a no-no
Cause it's a poor man's girl, and I will never give love
To how fast heroine, that's low as cocaine was
Martin had a dream, nigga, I did too
To make it out the hood, rich, bitch, off that stoup
So, I took it that thaw, and hit the street
With bundles of that ghetto love, to give it to kids
Momma said, never get high on your own supply
Especially if you plan to leave this hood bitch rich
Reminiscing on my past, damn it brings me to tears
See the more money that comes in, the more I disappear
Fresh to death, the latest kicks, rocking the latest gear
New Year's after the ball, twenty one song in they ear
Watch this strip, make me back it up, D'Angelo knows the feeling
Off that needles warm embrace, in a sexual heeling
This tracks moves like the 70's, got me feeling great
Watching my pen nodding off, spilling words out on the
I'm scared to love, cause you remind me of my past
Baby, you gotta trust me, cause I gotta girl and you got a man
I don't want you to judge me, I just wanna be your friend
Baby, you gotta trust me...

[Khalid]
Aiyo I live by the rules, trust nothing in skirts
Cause with that big butt and a smile, she be waiting to flirt
With a next man, a next hand, up under the skirt
Another dick in the jaw, more dick in the george
While you home sleeping, she creeping, you thinking it's yours
That's just how women is, I reminisce
On when I had to learn from experience, why they call you a bitch
And I ain't the best, but I ain't never denied
Tell me what nigga, flow sicker, spit shit better than mine
The plot dope on these tracks, you get federal time
You get your wig pushed back, that clap metal with mine
I'm on the grind, I don't settle for mines, nigga
With this track, a broad, with a pack, before I peddle a dime
Line for line, whose the best artist, the rest y'all garbage
But it's awkward, it's ass backwards, they still spinning your garbage
It's me, blunt: the artist, y'all niggaz is garbage

[Planet Asia]
Sweat jackets valor, rap money, looking like crack money
Relax, money, niggaz, it's raw, sweet aromatic
Backwood, fanatic nigga, this is Cali
Vigilante's tattered, the wife beaters and khakis
I'm taking over, cause y'all, cooking too much baking soda
B12, rock selling niggaz vacation's over
Medallion's guaca', only rock a three piece suit
Whenever holding case, the cops try to stop us
My henchmen behind me, in black benz's with big toppers
Get up on my life, nigga, the kid's proper
Wrist glint, the big shit, cult following fans be vixen
This is grown man business, pay attention
Or lay your position, fuck around and have a fatal collision
The moment where you should of made your decision
I made it, I'm living, I'm paid and I'm winning
From the aid of my wisdom, I created a system",Listen,2005

I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today
I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don’t even matter
I know it, I know it, I know I'm hurting deep down but can’t show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home
Ain't nobody callin' my phone

You don't gotta die
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die
Now lemme tell you why

It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

I've been on the low

I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

It feel like my life ain't mine

I don't wanna die today (hey)
I don't wanna die

I don't wanna die (no, I don't wanna die)
I don't wanna die

I been getting to it to be honest
Got my goonies sipping Don Julio with a few Rihannas
To be honest I been chilling, moving commas
I been killing to be honest
They just hating cause they want to move beyond us
To be honest once I throw this jewelry on your boo be on it
Never catch me coupe unless the roof be on it
To be honest you can’t move the way I move, you too pionic
Keep your cool, to be honest we been known to sleep a fool

To be honest you the one you really should be honest to
To be honest nigga, to be honest
I’m just being honest
To be honest I put my hood on my back
Then I made it out by myself, that’s understood, it’s a fact
Moved my family to Hollywood cause the fucking hood is a trap
Imagine me raising my son and he grow up pushing them packs
To be honest nigga, that’d break my fucking heart
My homies never had a fucking start
To be honest, I’m just being honest
Can I be honest? Cause I’m just being honest nigga
To be honest
To be honest they’d rather hit the kitchen like Benihanas
Whip it whip it and keep the semi with em for any drama
Then to make a penny honest to be honest they’ll rob a nigga blind
Let him live to be modest, to be honest these niggas done never helped me
Never liked me or felt me
Want to be in the picture but bitch I’m just taking selfies
To be honest, to be honest, they pray for your expiration
Praise your relationships then they pray for your separation
I pray for your education, paces and dedication
But I don’t owe you shit, not even an explanation
To be honest nigga, to be honest
I’m just being modest nigga, yeah
To be honest, who be on us?
We ain’t falling like you haters truly want us to, we on to you
To be honest you the one you really should be honest to

Oh, let’s be honest, naw ain’t fronting
Wasting all this time talking bout that bullshit

There's nothing I can do about it

But I'm afraid to lose myself

Maybe if I set myself free
From this world who's punishing me
Bleeding me, killing me, I'll be alright!

God! I'm bleeding, and now!
I see you, help me! I'm asking, please god!
Don't leave me, save me!
Or I'll fall, please god!!!

Everything looking fine in the Gump city
Girls walk around short skirts on looking pretty
You can tell the thugs from the sedity
All the high-class girls always acting nitty
But showing no pity, in the land
Of blunt passing
Niggas be everlasting
Where Mr. G gone blaze the weed 
Until I'm dead and gone off in my casket

[Chorus 1-Mr. G]
Now take a trip in my 'Lac with me
We can patch in 
You can go half on a sack with me
We can find a freaky slut to beat
And if it come down to it
We can bust our heat in the street
See, it don't really matter
Long as I'm down for you
And you down for me
We can ride together, forever
Rolling through the streets of the G-you-M-P

[Chorus 2-Khao]
It ain't nothing like riding the track, rocking the show
Making the crowd get hype, letting them know
Is you ready to wild out, I'm bout to flow
Got you peeping the style out, as I go

[Chorus 3-Big Pimp]
Now should I drop the game on them hoes
Now do you really understand 
How the pimp game goes
It's all about money and hoes
Keep us in it, with your mind froze
And slamming Cadillac doors

[Khao]
Now I'm a ride on the track
Giving you something that you can feel
Better buckle up before you go, haters hit the door
Cause we be hitting you with the skills
Don't give up before you flow, I'm a let you know
That my adrenaline assembling
That's enough to have a emcee trembling
Just give me the mic and them Frank Benjamin's
And call the paramedic, I'm about to injure men
Finish him, ain't many left to cope
Hearts stopped beating, listen to this stethoscope
So many emcees getting' left for broke
And try to make a comeback, shoulda kept the joke
Khao be the name, try dissin' me
Your history, your absence a mystery
Dried your game up like an antihistamine
Put that on Big Pimp and Mr. G
This'll be, something that people can ride to
Laid back, track cool like Rallo
Hit after hit we follow
Wanted to nibble and bit off way more than you can swallow
why'all must be drunk off the bottle
Hating on us, don't talk, bring yourself to me
I don't need nobody helping me
I'm about to lyrically burn a brother to the 12th degree
What why'all want to do now, huh
Humiliated, didn't know, Krumbsnatchaz affiliated
With Dirty, came up and really made it
All these cats want to be down with us
I really hate it, but illustrated, the picture
It takes skills to grab the mic
And keep it tight, some want, simplified:
Some had it, some got it
Some wish they did, and some don't

[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 3]

[Big Pimp]
Now let me take you to the land where the riders see
Pardon me shorty
Let me introduce you to my pimp psychology
Let a young nigga hold if you down with a holla at me
Now follow me, to my '98 'Lac outside
Now is she ready to ride
Slip cover your eyes, it's a surprise
I'll be obliged if you slide where them Dirty boys hide
And I was hypnotized when a young playa saw (um,um)
Your pretty brown eyes
And I apologize if I came to hard
Trying to get between your, sugar brown thighs
You know the pimp hide
And it's 12 o'clock tonight
I got late night lust
We need to, bring a pen and pad
And keep count (keep count) 
Of the nuts I bust (I bust)
I'm swerving, looking through my rearview nervous
While your head steady working
And your neck steady jerking
Up on your knees in my seat
And your lips steady slurping
I don't just kill a knob
And I know your mouth finna' throb
And baby if you could
Shine and rob with your tongue
Like old Inga Shywood (Shywood), situation all good
I love the way you got straight to it 
And plus I love the way you do it
I wouldn't take nothing from you
Girl you's a true headhunter
Booger-lips turner
You must have got it from you mother
Now look up in the sky, it's a pimp in the air
So freaky bitches better beware
I got your mind, mega blown
With the game that I spit
And keep them freaky bitches horny as hell

[Chorus 3]
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]
Ahh
Sho nuff, sho nuff
In my 'Lac with me
On a sack with me
Ahh
Drop the game on them hoes

Khao,"Making your way in the world today 
Takes everything you've got.
Taking a break from all your worries,
Sure would help alot.

Wouldn't you like to get away?

All those nights when you've got no lights,
The check is in the mail;
And your little angel
Hung the cat up by its tail;
And your third fiance didn't show;

Sometimes you want to go
Where everybody knows your name,
And they're always glad you came;
You want to be where you can see,
Our troubles are all the same; 
You want to be where everybody knows your name.

Roll out of bed, Mr. Coffee's dead; 
The morning's looking bright; 
And your shrink ran off to Europe, 
And didn't even write; 
And your husband wants to be a girl; 

Be glad there's one place in the world 
Where everybody knows your name, 
And they're always glad you came; 
You want to go where people know, 
People are all the same; 
You want to go where everybody knows your name. 

Where everybody knows your name, 
And they're always glad you came; 
Where everybody knows your name, 
And they're always glad you came...",Cheers,2008

Aiyyo, Mark, turn me up
Watch DJ's in the club burn me up like 'new music'
Same dog, Boss Hog, my style's Hazard, Duke
The truth? I'm big enough to Skywalk with Luke
I am revolutionary, rhyme ready
Phase one, mic, stage, one, yo, let's go
Jump, jump - or feel the react of this
Pump, pump - twelve gauge'n blaze (uhh)
Everytime I bring it hard for them niggaz
Like new whips, out the garage for them niggaz, like
Here's somethin for those who see past
The new MB with the spaceship dash
I come through in a two-thousand-fo'
Chicks holla out, 'UH-OH!' like I'm Nelly
Yo, I come with the real front page
Like Dame did, homeboy in 'Backstage'

Aiyyo, watch us do it (go 'head baby)
Ain't nuttin to it (go 'head baby)
You had your chance and blew it (go 'head baby)
All my niggaz are - move it's nuttin

E'rybody in the club better up them thangs
When it's beef, best believe I up that thang
Five seconds or less to up that chain
When I clutch that thang and, touch yo' brain
I'm, seventeen with twenty inches on Impala
Retros and Naughty sweats, out to make a dollar
Now most ya cats couldn't picture this, consecutive hit
After hit, it's ridiculous, conspicuous
Talk that I speak when I walk down the street
Yeah I walk with the heat and I talk to the beat
For the haters, that say 'Tona don't got it
Pants stay low and the flow stay knotted
It ain't the game, it's the players involved
World premier motherf**ker with a bunch of co-stars
Watch got mad colors like a bowl of Trix
Niggaz broke they whole life but still a benefit

Aiyyo, watch us do it (go 'head baby)
Ain't nuttin to it (go 'head baby)
You had your chance and blew it (go 'head baby)
All my niggaz are - move it's nuttin

Uh, I roll with major hitters, Dutch and Vega splitters
I know what y'all thinkin - it's a takeover
The unfriendly zone, young guns is older
You'll get smashed, need Jenny Jones to makeover
Your face, I'm high because I hate sober
Pussy patrol pull up in the Range Rover
And you get to know that don't want to know ya (that's right)
I hit chickens like I had pads on my shoulders
Slick with this, ridiculous
Rap bidness you're soft with bitch in parenthesis
My sentences'll make the hottest modern rappers
Feel defenseless, jumpin over fences
I'm accommodating all ya hatin lyricists
Spiritual lift, kidney shift
Ribs is cracked, lips is split, necks are slit
I do all kinda extra shit, heck with it
We the hecklers in the front, checkin ya texture
Ya teflon don't protect, waist down and neck up
I trailer park and just trash ya rap up

Khari,"I was sitting back, and I was thinking man
I ain't even trying to deal with this shit no more, you know
Cham' I don't know what to do yo, ya know
Seem like everytime a nigga make one step man
Nigga take two steps back, you feel me

They told me that pain was just in the frame, the irony of that
Cause that was the slogan showing, when they tried to see my tats
Never knew what was in the skin, would finally be a fact
Feeling like mother nature's, right behind me with a gat
Take that, the rain's loud on the window when it taps
To hell with the time, I thought that I could finally be relaxed
Tired of being po', yeah trying to leave the rats
Walk out to see three of your tires, that be on flat
And that one tire, left a sign of hope
That helps you to keep on grinding, when you kinda broke
That helps you to keep composure, up around your folk
That keeps from trying to wrap a rope, around your throat
Don't choke, you feeling like giving up
Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living sucks
God's telling you hear your boy, but you don't wanna give him trust
Mama telling you pay your tithes, and you yell at her back, ""for what""
So the pastor can ride faster, to get some rims on his truck
I don't think that they'll miss, ten percent of negative bucks
Put some Henny up in your cup, your problems will start to drown
But soon as your buzz leaves, then problems come back around damn

Keep your head up is what they telling me
, well it betta be
Sorry but the world keeps stressing me
Rain drops cloudin up the memories
It's gonna be alright is what they telling me
Don't let the stress get the best of me
Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
Till my brain gets cloudy bout a memory

God knows, how I feel now
On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he hell bound
It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of it
Do I walk slow or if I run, am I'm missing some'ing
I took the time out, to save a little bread
Now my eyes, got water in em
Why the fuck am I still standing here, nobody love me I ain't happy here
My mama said, she can't handle him
But still, I'm looking at the bright side
But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a different color sky
Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may never come
So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun
End it all, put a stop to the pain
That goes on in my head, everytime it rains
But that was speaking, so you listening to the thoughts
Of an evil spirit, in demonic verses everytime I talk
I'm confused, by my psychological set backs
In the storm, washin out through the wet cracks
Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places
I've given up so why the long faces? Let it rain

Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer
Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on your nerves
Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the third
Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't believing a word
Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as steel
Not to mention the realest member, of your family is getting ill
Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real
In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to kneel
To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama
You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a plumber
They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
You'd have to be a Superman, to live as much as me partna
you're trying, but help is just what you dialing
Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to drying
The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people lying
They saying they had it worse, but how come they all keep on smiling

Don't let stress take control, gonna be alright I know
I'm a make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah - 2x

My memory, heeeey-heeey yeah
Stressing me-stressing me, my memories
That's what they telling me
I'm trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
By my memories, yeah hey yeah

Are raining in on your bright, sunny day
Remember, the sunlight always comes after the rain
You should be thankful, everyday
should be a celebration of life.",Rain,2007
Kharma Konway,"Hello baby, it's a long time
I know you're here
I feel you close to me
So much to say but
Making all the words
I save them all inside
Then I see you and they disappear
Like leaves beneath the snow
And life don't wait for everyone
And yesterday, I let you go

I'm watching you tonight
And I waited for so long
I've been living on your memory
In a world where we were one
And you told me you could make it on your own

I'm watching you tonight
And it's making me cry
When I lost you, I lost everything
But our love should never die
Not mine, my love is born to be your love
Oh baby
To make history near you
But the moment when I see me in your eyes
You're gone, you're gone

You can say goodbye if you want to
I love you but I'll try to understand
But in my soul I know it's meant to be
Together you and me

But I know you came to fade away
Like voices in the wind
And I wonder if you feel my love
It's stronger than it's ever been

I'm watching you tonight
And there's no other one
All the love we gave eternally
Now it's dying in the sun
Not mine, my love was born to be your love
Oh baby
To make history near you
But that moment when I see me in your eyes
You're gone, you're gone, you're gone",I'm Watching You,2007

Is this the real life
Is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy,i need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come,easy go,
A little high,little low,
Anyway the wind blows,doesn't really matter to me,
To me

Mama,just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger,now he's dead,
Mama,life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama ooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on,carry on,as if nothing really matters

Too late,my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time,
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche, Scaramouche will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Galileo, Galileo,
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo Figaro, magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go,will you let me go
Bismillah, no,we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go, let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me,for me,for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters,
Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,nothing really matters to me,

I'm lovin him he's lovin me, together chillin and thangs

We goin out lookin good together, runnin the club
And leave together, hit the leather, suckin, fuckin, an stuff
He makin sure we livin straight, I'm havin children no game
We takin trips and vacations like the brady's an thangs

When I meet my king his hair will blow in the wind
Showin me his pride, his strength, the tone of his skin
To be so pure, so deep, the lion within
There to protect me if, whenever, I'm scared
Tellin me to smile, don't cry, to hold up my head
Keep ev'thang tight, make sure, the children stay fed
Can't hold shit down if I'm gonna have a bitch in my bed
Hand femur, always dreamer, kill a nigga bout head
Shoulders tight, be the line, don't put up wit um, take shit
Know how to treat me like a queen, take me out, buy me things

And unfound, gives a damn bout the shit in the street

In white linen, I'm fly, top down in the spiderville, riding for the rest of my life

A-town veteran, started at eleven
When and bought an eight-ball, I was staying down every since
That's why its hard to find a young rapper nigga better than
Bankhead resident, Westside represent, Pimp Squad mobster

Grand Hustle president, heart of a lion and the nuts of an elephant
Trap music heaven sent, you hating and it's evident
You trying to stack presidents, I'm tryin' to set precedents
The comparison is insulting my intelligence

'Cause real recognize real, and real you ain't never been
You never will, I catch ya where you chill,
Holla at ya where you live nigga, fuck a record deal (what's happenin')
I graduated out the yay, to stack a couple mill

My partners telling me shawty you have to chill (fuck that shit)
But I'm a end Up hating with steel, what is is, still dope boy trap niggas
Worldwide lovin' it, haters see the spider and they wanna put a slug in it
Fuck it, I'm a G, I been a rider, I ain't studding it
Better get ya mind of mind, and start hustling

[Chorus]

I should BG banging the stripes, ideas when I strike
Breaking my victims, lining them niggas all with the light
Get it right, hold it tight, blast with all your might
See we hustle for them grands 'til the early light

Follow my plan on command, leave 'em dead where they stand
Ain't no stopping the man nigga with grands in my hands
Living the fast lane, grand hustle the gram when the cash came
(Grand hustle nigga)

The police book me, take my fingerprint and last name
If I'm stuck in a cell, how would I maintain
Lock up all these niggas, the penitentiary mind frame
I strive for perfection, my method is quite collective

Check out the fuckin' way I just rep it
This dog pound gangsta in the back take a licking
Rims shining, fresh paint, T.I. counting paper
Big moves stay on deck with the tools
All y'all niggas and bitches and niggas get sprayed with the tools

[Chorus]

[Daz]
This how we hustle for the paper, cause the hustle get harder
I'm dog pounded out, an Atlanta Brave starter
Money, weed, and bitches, 24 inches conversating

Murdering, killing, wheeling the spider, on a mission
All my niggas y'all know how the fuck we kick it
I'm a keep my eye on a meal ticket, hustle it up motherfucker better kick it

Mi gente ¡Ustedes!
Lo más grande de este mundo
Siempre me hacen sentir
Un orgullo profundo

Los llamé ¡vengan conmigo
No me preguntaron dónde
Orgullo tengo de ustedes
Mi gente siempre responde

Vinieron todos para oirme guarachar
Pero como soy de ustedes
Yo los invitaré a cantar
Conmigo sí van a bailar
Yo los invitaré a gozar conmigo sí

They say love is a funny thing
But what's funny is the company that money brings
Every year my circle's getting smaller
Not Ben Baller but never had a thin wallet
I got dollars in different forms of currency
I got problems, but ain't nothing that worry me
And I ain't saying that I'm worry-free
I'm just saying nothing's fucking with me currently
Shit, I'm my own worst enemy
I make bread just to spend it like it's ten of me
It's Evidence and people call me by my government
Call me for weed, but don't call me for that other shit
Absorb the game that was meant to be sold
Not told, I heard good fortune favors the bold
So I'm standing in the rain, gambling the game
In the circle rolling dice with a hand full of gold and we go

You say you love me, do you really though?
You just want the world I'm sitting on
Are you the type that you get what you want then you're gone?
I don't give a fuck, just know your right from your wrong
You say you love me, do you really though?
You just want the world I'm sitting on
Are you the type that you get what you want then you're gone?
I don't give a fuck, just know your right from your wrong

You say you love me, but do you though?
Truly though, I see your eyes you let a shooter go
They'll try to catch me when I'm slipping with the toolie, yo
I just want a Gangsta's Paradise like I'm Coolio
Told my nigga Evidence, I don't leave no evidence
Not a trace, but they gon' know the Wraith was in their residence
The revenant, comes for the settlement, niggas is so irrelevant
They gon' try to use you, they gon' want your watch
And your chain and your shoes too, niggas will straight abuse you
They gon' stand there and act like they paid dues too
If you're right, then stay right
If you're wrong, then get gone, my nigga, then so long
Do you really want the best for me?
Are you happy when niggas' testing me?
You just trying to figure out my recipe
You will never get it, just bounce, nigga, you're stressing me

You say you love me, do you really though?
You just want the world I'm sitting on
Are you the type that you get what you want then you're gone?
I don't give a fuck, just know your right from your wrong

If I wasn't on this wave, if I didn't have this come up
Would you love me if I didn't have 9th or Alicia's number?
If I wasn't with the Roc, would you run and tell your friends
That you know me and I'm hot? Would I be in your Top 5?
Would you hit me back or see me later and tell me you forgot?
If I wasn't in that flick standing in front of the ride
Would you wanna make up if we had failed like you had thought?
Would you by my single on iTunes and pay $1.20-something?
Are you like the rest, sheep, blind leading the blind?
Would you praise me even if I didn't have a Dre co-sign?
Tell me what you want: new shoes or free tickets?
Don't ask me again, hit Dave if you want Kendrick
I know real love, I listen to Mary J
I can't carry you too, baby, ain't none of you marry Jay
Every breakup don't make up—the rest of you, Mary Kay
Screaming ""Westside!"", niggas gon' drive me crazy

You say you love me, do you really though?
You just want the world I'm sitting on
Are you the type that you get what you want then you're gone?

The third the Geechee, how many ways can you reach me?
Now most be scully, went from clean to muddy
Polished to shine, the season to rhyme
Been down like brown, like dirt to the ground
Been looking for love, now I bubble like suds
Others flew sky high, while others were duds
Live high up on the hills, to escape the floods

Baboon on your back, but what's sad is that crack
Was introduced to Hispanic communities and blacks
But then it spread to white and got everyone's undivided attention
Cause your daughter is on it and you can't hide it

No lockjaw, we got that raw shit and all the trimmings
Even though we got two albums, this one feel like the beginning
The intro, the Goodie we kinfolk, nigga it's fin to jump off
But now it's time I lay low
'Cause I believe the track goin' cut off

Or let some soft legs come in between our dreams
We live like Kings, and die like fucking men

Zap em for the pumpkin, at twelve
On the bottom bunk, holla at me
Six to the left, last one, can't turn over with dirt on ya
Slain dead, devils, don't have enough to purchase my essence
In the head, missing ounces, zip code, eight miles

And fowl-fowl-fowl-fowl

You got a one way ticket to hell,
Smack dab in the middle of the ATL,
And aww, I don't want to hustle no more but the streets won't let me go,
All my niggaz say,
Zone 1 (right here), Zone 2 (right here), Zone 3 Zone 4 (right here), Zone 5 and 6, but that's it.

For a nigga with a dream,
Atlanta is the city,
And they make it so seem,
But ride through the city,
And The Streets ain't clean,
All I see is drug deals, big wheels and feinds,
But any way they took East Atlanta back,(?)
Throw Atlanta Down,
Turned little Vietnam to a white folks town,
And fo, I forget to say you should have been fixture streets by MLK,
I ain't talkin' about the dope,
In talking about the raggedy road,
Niggas crack they rims riding over potholes,
But that's how it goes,
When you stuck fuck outta luck and lost in the ghetto's.

They talking ATL, Atlanta Georgia,
We the shit,
We talking Holy Feild you know that nigga named Michael Vick
They called me mamma boy but now they call me drummer boy,
They talking jet skiis, I had that shit last summer boy,
Charles is gone, Cher is show case,
5 5 9 night life (they had it goin on),
Back then Shawty D was gone,
Flat heat right here was on,
They put me on the song back then we all got along, ain't had no switch game
Atlanta just won't be the same,
Hit Man, Sammy Sam, DJ Smurf and Ying Yang,
I know when kids rockin(?) used to beat the block, I lived in a little house boy,
And the block party would never stop, I remember when G-Lyfe was when I had that little jelly bean,
I remember them East 30 Cadillacs and
Cut Supreme,(?) I built the school and shot Marvin that's what I did,
I remember the curfews what we used to get(?).

[Chorus]

A parking lot Alley niggaz thinkin' again,
When you speaking bout' Atlanta mention Ying Yang Twins,
There born and raised,
God done made it hard for us,
'Cause y'all outta towners came here and fucked shit up, 
But y'all can't fuck with us, cause as soon as shit start goin on you leave Atlanta and go right back home,
And that's the pussy mother fucker,
Ya heard me motherfucker, bring off in there mouth (?) ATL-ANTA,
Stop asking me cause that why I stay, if you can spell,
That's Atlant motherfucker, ya heard me mother fucker,
So don't ask me again,
'Cause I ain't saying it again,

Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?
Well burn motherfucker burn American Dream
Don't everybody like the taste of Apple Pie?
We'll snap for your slice of life I'm tellin' ya why
I hear that mother nature's now on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to ho
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go nowhere 2 go

All of my heroes did dope
Every nigga round me playin' married
Or paying child support
I can't cope
Never made no sense to me one day I hope it will
And that's that, sport, sport
Pray I live to see the day when Seven's happily married
With kids, woe woe
The world is moving fast and I'm losin' my balance
No time to dig, low low
To a place where ain't nowhere to go but up
Ya wit me say shit, sho sho
Now let me ask y'all this

Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?

I hear that mother nature's now on birth control

It's shitty like Ricky Stratton got a million bucks
My cousin Ricky Walker got ten years doing Fed time
On a first offense drug bust, fuck the Holice
That's if ya racist or ya crooked
Arrest me 4 this dope I didn't weight it up or cook it
You gotta charge the world cause over a million people took it
Look at me, you outta your jurisdiction now ya lookin' stupid
Officer, get off me sir
Don't make me call L.A. he'll have ya walking sir
A couple of months ago they gave OutKast the key to the city
But I still gotta pay my taxes and they give us no pity
About the youngsters amongst us
You think they respect the law
They think they monsters, they love us, reality rappin'
And giving the youth the truth from this booth
And when we on stage we scream
Don't everybody everybody

Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?
Well burn motherfucker burn American Dream
Don't everybody like the taste of Apple Pie?
We'll snap for your slice of life I'm tellin' ya why
I hear that mother nature's now on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to ho
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go nowhere 2 go

Officer of the most high
You touch me you touch the apple of this eye
If they kick us out where will we go
Not to Africa cause not one of them acknowledge us as they kin folk
Still eatin' pork
Abomination desecration for beating flesh
Penalty for violation is death
Woe, woe, to the man that strive with his maker on judgment day
Hip Hip Hooray!
Mr. Reaper Babylon the great
The mother of heartless is falling, prophecy must be fulfilled
The liquor fire is calling

Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?

Everything happens for a reason
Good doesn't come without pain
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason

Ain't it funny how you're born and then your life begins
Just like a baby all alone, that's if you wasn't a twin
You must begin to fend for self when the umbilical's cut
The doctor put you under the heating lamp, your spirit is touched
You know what, I take that back, why? You was alive
Date of conception, interception cause the sperm did collide
From T 'n A to DNA, feelings turn to children
The morning after pill didn't put a halt to our very existence
We living, breathing, soon we'll be teething
Our granny got a goal and now we want one for that reason
An adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages
But parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages
Cell therapists beware of this lugie that I spit
Incarceration without rehabilitation really don't mean shit
Little Ricky's home, he gotta serve probation for six months
But Uncle Donnel and Ol' Dirty Bastard still in the joint
Reset

Start over again
Everything happens for a reason
Good doesn't come without pain
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason

Good does not come without pain
Meaning, before it gets better, it's going get worse
Like my homies on the sick side still dying over turf
That don't belong to us
I mean us, left in the dust
Try to catch up with massah
I used to wanna wrap my hands around the esophagus of them crackers
But Ephesians 6:12 said it wasn't flesh and blood that we wrestle against
Principalities, powers of this world
Rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness
In high places, so throw that whole armor of righteousness
I spark this thing, but my name ain't Bubba
I got a problem with racist cab drivers, like Glover
And brothers that wax fat and forget all about the struggle
Yeah, come on, come on
Guess what, guess what
Time to reset this thing

Start over again
Everything happens for a reason
Good doesn't come without pain
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason

Listen to me
I awaken to sunlight that's beyond bright
This day will be done right
There is a war, just waiting on the other side of the door
But I'll be bringing God to the gunfight
Can't live forever, so have some fun, right
Life's a bowl of candy, you can have one, right
You can handle if tomorrow never comes, right
You'll get used to singing if only for one night
But I intend to raise two daughters and a son right
And I couldn't have wrote this if I was hopeless
And see I focus to provoke this
So open wide for my opinionated opus
Stop playing Go Fish, but not below this
Before I go, I thought that you all should know this
Recognize and realize before any regretting
Before you relapse, perhaps you'll consider resetting

Start over again

It don't matter about you stressin'
The only thing you do is tap that throat and wear protection
And only when she spit it out is when you feel rejection
Evidence and DNA drop down, stainin' her dress
She's making a great big one yes, can I get something off your chest?

I put her on a plate until she's no longer awake
They just lay fast asleep when I hit 'em with the snake
Put that venom up in 'em until I leave 'em with the shakes
On display, she's a model but she only model shoes
Not fake like a prosthetic leg or prostitute
How'd she choose? She just whispers in my ear, ""I'm with you""
I'm the type of dude that sends your baby momma out for food
And I also like her throat action with a passion
Love in her mouth for dental satisfaction
That means I hit the head like Greg Louganis then I'm splashing
Ugh, bust one back in the 'Lac stabbing (Hootie hoo!)
She knows what's happening, there's no reason to doubt it

As everything outdoors, the kinda girl I describe her
Like Michael Jordan when he's froze in a pose of a jumpman

When she's liquored up, I'm leaving my fingerprints on her butt
Ten-hut at attention as we stand for this woman
General Patton, boy, stop, we think she's coming
Loving the way that I'm licking her down, boy, you bluffing
Nothing, while a nigga like me be straight up royal flushing
But this ain't about playing no cards, dummy
Her get me open my sugar and she go hard for me
Even take a charge for me if the coppers caught us riding
To get a tray of fruit and a pack of 1.5s and
I'm all the way on them papers, she all the way on my team
We burn it down like California trees in the breeze (FIRE!)

She said her name was Tangerine, damn, the American Dream
She all about her fucking cream, shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine, she shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine, she shake it like a tambourine
She said her name was Billie Jean, said she wanna show me things

Make your daddy want to get the dog off the porch
Make your uncle go and want another corpse

Khun Vichayanee Pearklin,"The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know

Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free

Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I stay
Let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past

Let it go, let it go
When I rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway",Let It Go [From Frozen/Multi Language Medley],2014
Khy,"Como ayer, te busque 
En el doble techo de mi corazón 
Y hallé nostalgia de ti 
Soledad

Comencé a llorar 
Estos versos 
Bañados en canción 
Quiero volver a dormir con tu olor

Desahucie tus besos 
De mi memoria y digo adiós 
Te dejaré marchar

Duele tanto vivir 
Duele siempre sin ti 
Necesito tu olor 
Necesito tu calor

Quiero perfumar 
Mi alma con gotas de ti 
Y archivar mi dolor 
En el doble fondo que hay en mi colchón

Como ayer 
Me perdí en el laberinto 
De caminar sin ti 
Grite: ¿mi amor dónde estás? y lloré

Tú me preguntabas
Cuanto te quería yo 
Te quiero siempre amor

Duele tanto vivir 
Duele siempre sin ti 
Necesito tu olor 
Necesito tu calor

Quiero perfumar 
Mi alma con gotas de ti 
Y archivar mi dolor 
En el doble fondo que hay en mi colchón

Pinto amaneceres sin saber 
Cuales el dolor Que ahora tiene tu piel 
Pinto despedidas en papel Desechos de tu querer

Duele tanto vivir 
Duele siempre sin ti 
Necesito tu olor 
Necesito tu calor

Quiero perfumar 
Mi alma con gotas de ti 
Y archivar mi dolor 
En el doble fondo que hay

Te quiero siempre mi amor",Siempre,2013

You never had a hand that I could hold

A prisoner to you

Bleeding hearts are you and I
It's too late, we can't survive

Take me away, before I die inside, before my hands are tied
Take me away, before our love becomes a lie
Take me away, before the bridge is burned, before the lesson's learned
Take me away, before the point of no return

I got a complex issue with my heart, no feeling

Hoping you understand, trying to be a better man
Cause I can't let you in
I'm dealing with my past though, it's getting hard to let go
And you should ask the last hoe, why she make this asshole out of me

And yeah we cut it close, but is you what I want
You maybe got what I need, but I can't let you go

Yet a nightmare, clashing into my day time
This a be my last hello, now baby goodbye
We ain't N'Sync, I'm gone
So cry me a river like Timberlake a be the song
Am I wrong for tryna make it right, yet you pick the fight
Whether I win or lose, I still was your shining knight in armor
What goes around comes back, don't say I warned ya
Life a bitch, and they usually call that Karma
So on to the next, you was playing me so
I'm cutting off the string, no longer your yo-yo

Put your stunna frames on, so you can see what I'm saying
I got that ice on my teeth, you can see what I'm saying
I'm saying - kinfolk, they call me Kinfolk Jones
I feel so fly up in my frames, I done came up with a song
I got them D.G., Louis V, Armani and the Gucci jones

Red monkeys on my ass, on my feet Bathing Apes

See my shirt match my car match my shoes match my lens
Damn kinfolk! You done merked them folks again
Again when it come to clothes man I be killing it
Trill talk, my frame game is ridiculous

Cause my future so bright I got to wear shades
And my eyes probably red from the kush and the haze

Walk like a pimp and grab my nuts with my shades on

He workin' with them people 'cause he see his sale slippin'
He used to watch the Feds, just as you was flippin' weight
Now you can catch a Fed case flippin' mix tapes

Man, I'm just like wow, that shit ain't even straight
I was gone drop mine but I think that I'ma wait
I think I'd rather switch my hustle and flip some real estate
While hip hop trying to hate, I'ma make some realacake

I'ma flip a couple houses, make a couple hundred thousand
Plus to me the mix tape, game too overcrowded
And nothing they can do about it, give my tapes away for free
And put it in your face on my kush DVD
So you can

Look at my hair, look at my shoes
Look at my jeans, look at my jewels

When they come to being fly I ain't talking about nothing
I stay rockin' the best shit, all of the fresh shit
By the time you get on it, I'll be on the next shit

This ain't about hip hop, this about me
Look at my dreads, look at my fresh, look at my mouthpiece
Look at my car, look at my rims
If girls saying shit, cool but she ain't like him

I start a new trend every time I get dress
I write a new hit every time I get fresh

Look at me right now, man, I'm so fresh today

About them real women out there, why'knahmsayin'?

Holla at me any time you need me

If you ever need me, just holla at ya kinfolk

She came down South with me
Suffered through the drought with me
Lived out of car, still didn't have no doubt in me
She went without with me, lost e'rythang she had
To get me back on my feet, she borrowed from her mom and dad

She wore the same clothes, even rocked the same shoes
She sold her earrings, mayne, to get yo? boy back in the booth
She sold my mixtapes to help me get our shit straight
My gal trill and for me, she'll do whatever it takes

She took a charge for me when I got caught with a gun and 'dro
At TSU homecomin' at the mass co
She on the grind with Shine, tryin' to come up on these figures
I'ma keep it trill, mayne
She realer than most of y'all [Incomprehensible]

Taught her stay down and you'll come up

Unter deiner Haube hast du dampf wie ein Audi yeah
Bruder lass mal die Pafferei 
Statt Ganja in den Taschen hast du Sportsachen und 'ne Flasche Wasser bei
Schäm dich nicht für deine vergossenen Tränen
Sie trocknen mit jedem Atemzug, von der Gosse geprägt
Ich schreibe dir diesen Brief in einer bitteren Zeit
Du bist nicht allein ? Lies was zwischen den Zeilen

Das ist Energie
Wir pushen dich wieder hoch
Aus einer kaputten Wohnung nach oben, teil die Vision
Nimm die Energie 
Dein Körper wird wiederbelebt, mit diesem Packet, digitales Vitamin-C
Eine Packung Energie von meiner Melodie 
Lass mal die Welleschieberei bevor die Geister dich in den Keller ziehen
Energie, drück auf Play und du spürst diese Energie
Die Energie, die Energie

Das hier ist Energie für jeden da draußen der nicht mehr weiter weiß
Also verschwende dein Leben nicht mit dem Zeitvertreib
Kleinigkeiten die dich daran hinderten dich aufzubauen
Zu viele falsche Ratten die dir grinsend in die Augen schauen
Bal deine Fäuste und halt deine Freunde auf Distanz
Filter die besten raus und beuge dich keinem Kampf 
Bäume sind stille Zeugen, die immer grade sind 
Drück aufs Gaspedal und du spürst den wahren Wind
Während alle am Schlafen sind bist du noch wach
Den in jeder Zelle dieser Erde steckt die pure Kraft
Die Zukunft hat für dich was großes geplant
Oder leb dein leben weiter, so wie es war

Ich würde zum Desperado weil ich das Leid gesehen hab
Wenn du kein Bruder bist zähl ich dich zu meinen Gegner
Es sind die kleine Fehler die dich zu einem Mann formen
Ich wollte hoch und mein Hass war der Ansporn
In meiner gang nehmen sie mich Paco Ramires
Weil dieses Gehirn funktioniert wie eine komplette Firma
Ich war hungrig eine der wenigen der wusste was die Vernunft bring
überall zog ich meine Jungs mit
Leider zeigte die Zeit beiden das du ein Hund bist
Puto Noch ein Wort und sieh zeichnen dein Umriss
So viele Chivatos die ich in mein Leben traf ich bereue jeden Tag jede tat jedes Mal
Wenn ich in das Feuer sprang für ein dieser Drecks wesen
Ich bin anders Leute wer von euch will jetzt reden
Wer von diesen Hurensöhne will mir kein Respekt geben
Wir sind die Wahrheit zwischen den lügen dieser Rap Szene
Standhaft ihr macht alle krampfhaft auf ganz krass
Sei ein Desperado und du siehst wie es ein Mann macht
Im dunklen an den Parkstangen siehst du denn pump in meinen Adern
Wir meditieren hier den ganzen Tag lang
Jeder will den Kuchen umgeben von versuchen
Für jeden scheiß Pain in meinen Leben wirst du bluten
Verwandt mit der Hantel im Kampf unser Bande
Ein Leben für denn tot Bruder Sangre pro Sangre

Ich wurde zum Desperado als ich verraten wurde
Ich habe Rache geschworen für meinen Namen Hombre
Für jede träne meiner Mutter weint deine zwei
Ernesto Carlos gibt den Feind keine Zeit
Gib einen Kind ne knarre und der ist krasser
Als jeder breit gebauter anabol motherfucker
In dieser Welt brauchst du harte Eier
Solange Krieg herrscht du Schlampe
Will ich keine Party feiern
Ich bin da draußen und verschaffe mir Respekt
Diggah was ist jetzt Gjana Khan Dirty X Bodycheck
Leg mal deine Waffe weg ich mach bei jeden der Kanacken stress
Das hier nimmt dein Leben wie ne Packung Meth
Digitaler Massencrash cash machen digital
Che Guevaras flamme brennt vor dir stet der General
Ich gebe gas und ich schleife grad die Machete scharf
Ich schlag mir die Wege frei und starte den gegen Schlag
Meine Soldaten warten nur auf mein Handzeichen
Damit sie wissen wann sie angreifen
Du bist ganz leise wenn ich komme und dich zusammen scheiße
Und dir dein scheiß iPhone gegen die wand schmeiße
Eine dickere wand breite die Gun ballert
Ich lasse dich Lambada tanzen du Bandala
Ab Heute bin ich ein ganz anderer Man baba und tätowiere mir

Sie beißt mir in die Lippen und krallt sich an meinem Rücken fest
Sie ist ein Löwin und ich reiße ihr den Schlüpfer weg
Sie duftet gut und schmeckt lecker wie Eiscreme

Ich lasse ihren Körper erzittern wie bei nem Stromschlag
Sie stöhnt, ich knurre, das ist Atomkraft

Hör mir zu, bevor die Zellentür sich hinter deinem Rücken schließt
Ah, stopp, warte, bevor du mir 'ne Predigt hältst
Was soll ich machen? Meine Eltern hatten wenig Geld
Alles, was ich habe, muss ich selber finanzieren
Und denkst du wirklich, dass die Welt sich dafür interessiert?
Ich war genau wie du, als ich in deinem Alter war
Ich warne dich, da draußen lauern überall Gefahren
Ach, ich halt’ mich wach, indem ich meine Nase weiß puder’
Was hast du gesagt? Ab jetzt haben wir Streit, Bruder
Ey, nimm die Finger von mir weg und lass mich los
Guck dich doch mal an, du siehst so aus als wärst du fast schon tot
Ist dir das alles die Tränen deiner Mutter wert?
Tief in deinem Innern steckt doch immer noch ein guter Kern!
Ich bin kein Kind mehr, ich kann selbst auf mich aufpassen
Und du bist nicht mein Vater, der sich schnell aus dem Staub machte
Der kein Geld in unser Haus brachte
Ein Scheiß-Alkoholiker, den keiner hält, wenn er mal ausrastet
Erwartest du etwa mein Mitgefühl?
Dass eine Träne mein Gesicht berührt? Ich bin dafür nicht der Typ
Das ist kein Grund, sein Leben einfach wegzuschmeißen
Dein Kapitel und du blätterst in den letzte Seiten
Was willst du mir erzählen, was ich noch nicht gesehen hab’?
Ich kenne meine Fehler, also mach hier nicht auf Lehrer!
Genau das sagt jeder - bis er dann im Knast landet
Und deine ganze Familie von dir Abstand nimmt
Hör damit auf und mal den Teufel nicht an die Wand
Und bist du weg, hat deine Freundin ’nen andren Mann
Weißt du was? Ich will die Scheiße nicht mehr hören!
Bruder, geh mir aus dem Weg, ich bin bereit, um zu zerstören
Ich hab’ du hast nix, außer Hass und blinde Wut
Du bist verantwortlich für das, was diese Kinder tun
Bist du ein Bulle oder was? So läuft das hier am Randbezirk
Junkies ballern Stoff in ihre Vene, bis die Hand vibriert
Hörst du die Sirene? Wie sie näher kommt?
Kannst du mir verraten, wie ich ansonsten die Familie ernähren soll?
Zeit ist wertvoll, triff nur die richtige Entscheidung
In einer scheiß Situation zu einem sehr schlechten Zeitpunkt
Wir haben genug geredet, psch, ich will nix mehr hören
Du machst ein’ großen Fehler und den bereust du später

Warte, ich programmiere ein System und hab’ gleich alle Daten

Und alles kaputtmacht, wenn er in die Booth geht

Aber du gabst mir den Plan, denn woanders hätte ich nicht mal die Wahl
Ich kenn’ deine Intrigen und Gefahren
Für die Freiheit, die du einem gibst, muss man teuer bezahlen
Ich habe dich geliebt und ich wär’ für dich verblutet
Deine Gutmütigkeit ist in Wahrheit Betrug
Wir befinden uns im freien Fall
Ich war süchtig nach dei'm Halt, aber genau so wurd’ ich eiskalt
Du hast nie um mich gekümmert
Du behütest deine Lügen, denn die Wahrheit liegt unter den Trümmern
Wir lieben dich, obwohl du deine Fehler wiederholst
Auch wenn ich bei dir groß wurde, war ich nie dein Sohn
Wir kennen uns gut, aber dennoch ist die Zeit begrenzt
Denn wenn der Tag kommt, werden wir uns beide trennen

Kianush,"Baby, weißt du noch früher
Von uns beiden war keiner ein Lügner
Geliebt und geschätzt, vor dir hat' ich Riesen Respekt
Ständig deinen Namen verteidigt
Hab' doch gesagt, ich bin da, wenn es Streit gibt
Heute start' ich den Tag mit der Einsicht
Weil du weg bist, nicht mehr da bist
In mir staut sich die Hektik und Panik
Sex mit dir ein Mix aus Englisch und Spanisch
Beiß mir in mein Ohr, ich hör' wie du atmest
Krallst dich an mir fest, du schreist, du bist Wahnsinn
Deine Nägel bohren sich tief in die Haut
Du weißt, was du willst, gehörst zu den miesesten Frauen
Und ich bin bereit, um zu killen, also komm näher

Baby, komm näher
Baby, komm näher (Kianush!)
Baby, komm näher (Cedric!)
(Wir holen uns die Diamantas!)

Ich erinner' mich noch gut als wir uns das erste Mal sahen
Ich gebe zu, es fiel mir verdammt schwer etwas zu sagen
Denn du gabst mir den Rhythmus und ich folgte dir
Die Anderen haben dir doch immer nur was vorgespielt
In deine wunderschöne Stimme, Baby, hat sich mein Ohr verliebt
Aus deinem Mund klingt jedes Wort so wie ein Lied
Ist schon komisch wie wir beide uns verändert haben
Ob in guten oder schlechten Zeiten seit dreizehn Jahren
Und noch bis heute, unsere Liebe ist stark
Ich rappe auf den Beat deinen Part
Ich liebe deine Art wie du guckst und spielst mit deinen Haaren
Du kannst dich sicher fühlen, denn du liegst in meinem Arm
Der ganze Boden bebt, wenn du laut wirst und streitest
Heute geh' ich aus die Haustür, alleine
Meine kleine süße Lady
Sei nicht länger böse, Gefühle sind crazy

Du bist meine Droge und ich brauche deine Kicks
Und egal was ihr bietet, ich tausche gegen nichts
Alles was auch kommt, wird auch wieder gehen
Aber du bleibst für immer bei mir stehen
Du bist meine Droge und ich brauche deine Kicks
Und egal was ihr bietet, ich tausche gegen nichts
Alles was auch kommt, wird auch wieder gehen
Aber du bleibst für immer bei mir stehn'

Du bist mein Diamant!
Kein Anderer fasst dich an!
Ich geh' für dich in den Kampf, oh!
Du bist mein Diamant!
Kein Anderer fasst dich an!
Ich geh' für dich in den Kampf (oh, ooh!)

Mir geht es gut, Mama, guck, ich mach' jetzt dick Patte
Sie wollten nur, dass ich brav in die Schule geh'
Ich hab' nicht zugelassen, dass sie mir die Zukunft nehmen
Ich war der Erste in dem Viertel, der die Scheiße rappte
Ich kannt' nur Tupac, DMX und Michael Jackson
1996, damals noch neun Jahre
Und heute leb' ich das, was ich damals geträumt habe
Leute sagen „Lass die Finger weg von dem Rapbusiness!“
Die Leute, die das sagen, sind heute blacklisted
Ich hab' keine Zeit für dein'n Quatsch, ich muss Cash machen
Die Familie ruft, Baba, das ist Chefsache
Und wenn es sein muss, mach' ich's mit der Brechstange
Ich musste einstecken, so wie ein Crashdummy

Ich nehm' euch alle mit nach oben wie ein Helikopter

Rappe für die Generation, rappe für die Generation
Ich rappe für die Generation, rappe für die Generation

Yeah, was hab' ich dir gesagt, wenn ich komme?
Nach meiner Platte spielt dein Vertrag keine Rolle
Du kommst mit deinem Modescheiß nicht in meine Zone rein
Warum guckst du so als ob du grad in 'ne Zitrone beißt?
Huh, es ist viel zu vieles vorgefallen
Wir gehen alle auf die Knie, bevor wir fallen
Vor paar Jahren sah das alles hier noch anders aus
Rapghettosuperstars kommen aus dem Underground
Push es bis zum Limit, pump den Rhythm mitten in der City
Komm mit mir, ich kille alle Rapper mit dem
Neunmillimeterflow, Jackpot, dein Telefon weg
Ihr seid herzlich willkommen in meinem Ghettoproject
Ich folg' nur meinem Instinkt, der General
Ihr Blindfische seid alle gefickt von der Handywelt, ich sende Wellen
Bevor der letzte Engel fällt

Kianush,"Ich brauch' nur eine Hütte im Wald
Meine Hülle ist in hunderttausend Stücke zerfallen
Ich brauche Abstand von allem, Facebook und Smartphones
Hazeduft und Grasjoints und dem Fakepussystarzeug
Was du hörst, ist das Feuer meiner Seele
Matrix, Menschen werden gesteuert wie Geräte
Willkommen in meinem Atelier
Jeder Song ist wie ein Kunstwerk, ich bin ein Künstler im Grundkern
Keiner kannte Rap von uns, jeder hat nach Geld gesucht
Vierzehn Jahre später hör' ich Lieder, die ich selbst erschuf
Ich wuchs auf in einem Hochhausblock
Als kleiner Junge wollte ich schon immer groß rauskommen
Aber heute will ich nur noch eine Hütte im Wald
Durch zu viel Stress bekam ich eine Lücke im Bart
In meinem Kopf sind viel zu viele Schüsse gefallen
Zwischen den Zeilen erkennst du den inneren Feind

Ich brauch' nur eine Hütte im Wald
Und lass' die Erde hinter mir wie 'ne Rakete im All
Ich kann euch alle nicht mehr sehen
Verschwindet aus mei'm Leben! 
Oder haben wir ein Problem?

Verschwindet aus mei'm Leben! Oder haben wir ein Problem?

Ich brauch' nur eine Hütte im Wald
Denn wenn es hier so weitergeht, Bruder, drücke ich ab
Ich seh' die Blicke, die mich brechen sollen
Neidische Versager, die nichts haben und sich deshalb mit mir messen wollen
Geldgeile Bitches im Spotlight auf Koks
In meinem Leben gab es leider keine Hochzeit in Rom
Es ist immer noch derselbe Krieg
Denn ich habe früh gelernt, dass es hier auf dieser Erde keine Helden gibt
Jeder kannte Rap von uns, keiner hätte dran geglaubt
Heute fahr' ich AMG und mach' im Monat zwanzigtausend
Geld ist da, doch ich spür' immer noch denselben Hass
Nur für bisschen Seelenfrieden geb' ich dir die Hälfte ab
Ich spür' den Schmerz so wie Stiche im Hals
Denn ohne dich in meinem Leben ist es bitterlich kalt
Ich zitter' am Leib, wer kann mich von den Gittern befreien?
Ich möchte Ruhe und brauch' nur eine Hütte im Wald

Ich brauch' nur eine Hütte im Wald
Und lass' die Erde hinter mir wie 'ne Rakete im All

Kianush,"Die unendliche Reise
In die Ferne, ohne Rückkehr
Ich lege mein Handy beiseite
Bevor ich in dieser Welt noch verrückt werde
Ich führe ein ernstes Gespräch
Du hörst mir nicht zu, ignorierst du mich etwa?
Ein schmerzvoller Weg
Aber nach der Träne spürst du, wie die Wirkung dich ändert
Zu der Zeit gab's keine Smartphones
Von damals blieben nur noch 'n paar Jungs
Sozialamt, kein Para auf Kontos
Sorry Mama, ich wurde meinen Job los
Leider gab es für mich keine andere Option
Außer Drama mit Waffen und Munition
Sorry Vater, denn ich war immer nur stoned
Dieses Gangstergelaber, ich schäme mich so
Meine Seele war tot, ich hatte kein'n Plan
„Beruhig dich, mein Sohn! Die Welt ist kein Spaß
Lach, wenn du lachen musst wein, wenn du weinen willst.
Eh, sei der Mensch, der du sein willst.
Mach dir keine Sorgen um uns, alle deine Worte sind Kunst.“
Eh, mach das Mic laut, dreh den Scheiß auf
Ich muss reinhauen, ich hab' keine Zeit für den Streit, yo
Sorry Mama, dass ich doch nicht so brav war
Wie du es für die Zukunft geplant hast
Ich bin da, Mom, wovon ich immer geträumt hab'
Nur ein Junge aus Deutschland
Ich erinner' mich noch ganz gut
An die Zeiten, damals mit Mahmut

Ich hör' den Beat und hebe ab
Produzier' Musik jede Nacht
Ich dreh' den Pegel immer auf
Und keiner ruft hier die Cops
Willkommen in meinem Viertel, wo jeder Zweite leider keinen Job hat
Wo der Sohn von meinen Nachbarn, seinen Rucksack voller Stoff hat
Ich erinner' mich noch gut
Als ich selber noch so war
Ich zahlte mit Schweiß, Tränen und Blut
Und brachte mein'n Arsch in die Charts
Ich hol' uns eine Mille mmit dem neunmillimeter-scharfen Flow
Auch ohne eine Brille werden hier in meinem Viertel Stars geboren
An alle meine Leute, die da draußen grade meine Mucke pumpen
Wir fliegen alle hoch bis an die Spitze, denn wir kömmen alle von da unten
Und bitte Mama, mach dir keine Sorgen, denn dein Junge hat 'n Plan
Mache alle meine Worte, die ich grade sag', eines Tages wahr
Alle meine Worte, die ich grade sage, mach' ich eines Tages wahr
Schwör' auf meine Mama, gib mir noch ein paar Jahre

Kianush,"Ich kenne Cops in meiner Stadt, die meine Mucke pumpen
Wir waren auf derselben Schule, früher gute Kumpels
Wir spielten Fußball und wurden groß im selben Viertel
Keiner von uns wusste damals, wo die Welt uns hinbringt, ah
Du hast gelacht, weil ich scheiße rappte
Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass du mal die Seite wechselst
Wie auch immer, ich bin immer noch derselbe Kerl
Wir wissen alle, was ihr ohne eure Eltern wärt
Ich machte Daddy stolz auch ohne Abitur
Mit sechs war ich süß, Pottschnitt und Bugs-Bunny-Schuhe
Und in dem Alter, wo die Jungs dann auf Partys fuhr'n
Machte ich Musik, baute Beats, bis der Magen knurrt
Mich sahst du niemals am zocken in der Spielothek
Stattdessen lernte ich wie man selber seine Videos dreht
Gib mir das Mic und ich zeig' dir, wie man richtig rappt
Nur ein falsches Wort und die Hälfte vom Gesicht ist weg

Ich kenn' Soldaten, die da draußen meine Mucke hören
Schon in der dritten Klasse trugen alle Muskelshirt
Und nach der Zehnten hab' ich kein'n mehr von ihn'n gesehen
Ich hab' gehört, sie waren im Krieg und sind schizophren
Sie reden irgendwas von wegen „Alles nur korrupt
Alles eine Lüge, sie verkaufen uns nur Hollywood!“
Alkohol trinkende Fettsäcke laufen rum
Hunderttausend Bodyguards gegen hunderttausend Jungs
Verschwörungstheorien sind aufgetaucht
Alle labern Scheiße, keiner weiß mehr, was er glauben soll
Die Autos brennen, überall fliegen Molotovs
Polizisten tragen eine Rüstung so wie RoboCop, ah
Ich weiß, du kommst vom Ponyhof
Deswegen machst du aus dem Rap deine Modenshow
Ihr seid alle nicht mehr cool, wenn die Kohle kommt
Ich hole alle Steine runter von dem Horizont, eh

Kianush,"Ihr sagtet alle, „Lass die Finger weg vom Rapgeschäft!“, jeder denkt, er wär' Eminem
Keiner wusste, was in mir steckt, Techniken à la Jackie Chan
Meine Raps sind intelligent, LiP auf dem Etikett
Kettensäge macht rat-ta-tat, mit dem Kopf durch die Decke
Der rappende Psychopath, ich fetze die Bühne ab
Es sind heftige Typen da in 'ner mächtigen Überzahl
Meine Texte sind lyrischer, jeder Rhythm wird hier gebusta-rhymed
Mit der Technik von Masta Mic, jede Zeile ist Maßarbeit
Lös' die Ketten der Sklaverei, böse Bretter aufs Nasenbein
Lade mein Akku voll, ich will fressen, geh' mit der Waffe rein
Platze rein in dein Label, ich bin bereit für 'ne Ballerei
Jeder Schuss ist ein Flatterball und knallt unter die Latte rein
Diese Platte ist classic wie Boyz n the Hood und Menace
Es läuft in den Clubs wie Khalid, die 90er-Jungs mit Message
Hab' Leute per Funk connectet, erzeugen Shows, die perfekt sind
Das Feuer wird euch verbrennen, ich bin back to the roots

Es fing an mit neunziger-Rapflows und dann kamen die Doubletimes
Leute mit Dresscode wie Biggie Smalls zur Puffy-Zeit
Dann kam die Technik, jeder war im Rapperfilm
Cubase in Studios, jeder konnte fetter klingen
Jeder hatte Internet, der Shit wurde veröffentlicht
Und neue Türen öffnen sich
Wir haben alles selbst gebaut und erschaffen
Wir hatten denselben Traum, lass machen!

Im schwarzen Ferrari wie das Cartel de Cali

Vollautomatik auf Arbi, meine Sicario-Army

Bomberjacken, FUBU G's, jeder hörte Michael Jackson

Als wir Fresskicks geschoben und gelacht haben

Michael Jackson, Michael Jordan
Michael J. Fox, Dr. Dre, Snoop oder Nate Dogg
Tony-Hawk-Skateboard, wir waren noch alle nicht gebrainwashed
Leben ohne Apple oder Playstores
In meinem Innern bin ich immer noch ein Kind
Eine Träne für die, die nicht mehr wissen, wer sie sind
Wir waren ein mieser Geheimtipp, doch Hype bricht

Kiara,"Porque después de hacernos el amor
Me dejas una extraña sensación
Te beso y tú finges dormir

Normalmente te rendías sobre mí
Antes tú te desnudabas frente a mí
Ahora te cuidas y te encierras al vestir

Tesoro mío, sólo mío
Tesoro mío si supieras lo que digo
Me provoca abrazarte como antes
Y amarte como nunca
Y sentir que aun eres mía

Prefiero callar y no decirte
Qué, que volví a ver al hombre que tanto ame
Porque tuvo que aparecer él otra vez
Si contigo yo había conseguido la paz al fin

Tesoro mío sólo mío
Tesoro mío si supieras lo que digo
Me provoca que me abrases como antes
Y que me ames como nunca
Porque quiero ser sólo tuya

Tesoro mío, sólo mío

Me provoca abrazarte como antes
Ámame como nunca
No has hecho en tu vida

Tesoro mío, sólo mío

Kiara & Guiller,"He tratado de no pensar en ti 
como si nunca hubieras pasado por mi vida 
siguiendo los consejos de mis amigos 
mujeres, tragos y otras cosas mas 

Regreso de madrugada todos los dias 
y desde que entro en el ascensor 
no importa si estoy solo o acompanado 
me aprieta algo en el pecho, es la misma herida 

El problema es que te amo 
como nunca a nadie ame 
yo que siempre he dejado 
es porque nunca habia amado con un amor asi tan bravo 

Yo necesito mas de ti 
que del agua para vivir 
yo necesito mas de ti 
que del aire para respirar 
tu eres la vida de mi vida 

Yo necesito mas de ti 
que del sueno para dormir 
yo necesito mas de ti 
que cualquier cosa para vivir 
vida de mi vida... 

He tratado de no pensar en ti 
pero es igual que cerrar los ojos frente al sol 
su luz es tan fuerte como este amor 
que me atormenta hasta en la oscuridad 

El problema es que te amo 
como nunca a nadie ame 
yo que siempre he dejado 
es porque nunca habia amado con un amor asi tan bravo

Oh oh oh oh ooh
Yo we back
I'm good, so good
And we back and we back

Raps just make me anxious and acid made me crazy
Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
And I still make this song, and I'mma make another
If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother
Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother
Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors
Ben A Baller, Benford, butlers, chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance, hundreds zan, gallon lean
Make a joke bout Leno's hair then piggy back on Fallon's spleen
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain I got some motherfucking business
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?
Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job
And I'm good

Even better than I was the last time baby
I'm good, so good

Work, work, work, work, bang nigga, bang
Twerk, twerk, merge, swerve, dang, pick a lane
Flip a bird, pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's a shame
But God I'm good, swear I couldn’t be better
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some ""x"" on my tongue
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexing my lungs
See them showing they teeth, that's just them flapping they gums
If they bite and I'm snapping clap clap collapsing they lungs
Call me Chancellor The Rapper, please say ""The Rapper""
Magical word (poof), please say 'Kadabra
Replay the replays, Green Bay, the Packers
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk till dawn
It's just us, and trust ya bottom bitch, might stuff the fucking bong
I'm the motherfucking fucker, fuck a niggas fucking dumb

I don't know about that

Alright y'all, could you, could you be quiet for a minute, alright?
Wiz, turn it down Dukes
Hey, could y'all please shut up?
Wiz, chill
Yo, Play got something to say

Alright yo, alright yo

Hey yo, Herb
Bass

Oh, ooh, yeah
Oh, ooh, yeah

They come from miles around to check out the sound
Watch the walls come tumbling down
Kid 'n Play is the perfect team
Now it's time to let off some steam
Don't be bashful now, don't be shy
This ain't no time for you to wonder why
You're not on the floor with someone else?
Don't blame us, blame yourself
You ain't got the guts to get with it
The time is now Dukes, just admit, this is the perfect situation to take a chance in
'Cause this is the house that we dance in

Do a little dance y'all (like this y'all, like that y'all)
Feel the groove (I feel it, I feel it now)
Make a little love now (ooh ah ooh ooh ooh ah) 
This party's at the fun house (this party's at the fun house)

Now just go, let the beat flow
Not you Crow, I don't want to come see your freak show flow
Smooth not slow, be a dynamo
Kid 'n Play says so and yo
Let's flip when the beat rips
Wiz got a gift and we got the tune to shoot it
Your place or mine? Anywhere's just fine
And when you're in the mood to unwind and find a good time
I'm looking for a great time
If that's too much to ask then I'll pass
Let's settle for a nice time
Anytime's the right time for a Kid 'n Play rhyme
Right here, just fine

Do a little dance y'all (like this y'all, like that y'all)
Feel the groove (I feel it, I feel it now)

Only a few moments left to step
So you're best to step to her
It's your last chance to do her
You, uh, wanted to know what the good life is?
Beats by Herb, Rhymes, Kid 'n Play and cuts by Wiz
Just hype it up for this here crowd
With moves that would make friends stay proud
Last call for alcohol at the jamboree
Just get off the walls and jam for me
Just rock when the beat drops
Watch the clock, it's almost time to close up shop
But we got to hip hop harder
Wiz, you and Stan, look out for my father
Kid, make sure ain't nothing been broken
Last record y'all and I'm hoping we don't get caught because I know her
If mom finds out, I'm over

Do a little dance y'all (like this y'all, like that ya'll)
Feel the groove (I feel it, I feel it now)

Kid 'N Play,"Awww yeah uh uh
Feels good

The time has come to enjoy myself
I've left my problems up on the shelf
The work days over and I've got it made
Like Johnny Kemp said I just got paid
And I'm ready to mangle young man single and free
Ready to get busy, down to party hardy and have a good time
All I need is a partner in crime
Call up the homies and hope they might
Say they down to paint the town red tonight
Look in the closet and pull out the hype gear
Pull up the hightop fade and I'm outta here
Do a disco on a party of some kind
Hope that I would find myself a good time
Before I'm through and the night is done
Man I'm gonna have some fun

Ain't gone hurt nobody we just dancin ya'll
Ain't gone hurt nobody out there on the floor
Ain't gone hurt nobody we just dancin ain't we
Ain't gone hurt nobody gonna give you more
O yeah yeah

If you lookin' for war step on the dance floor
Check your coat and troubles at the door
Cause we sure you gonna see us smile today
The problems of the world seem miles away
The only thing that matters is a good time
That can be had with the help of a good ryme
The DJ's hype well and up to par
Uh-oh there goes a cutie at the bar
So I stroll on over to her and say hi
And tell her I'm the P-L-A-Y
And would you like to dance awhile
I'll do anything to see your smile
See my job is to tell you how
After a couple of songs I'll require
Having fun well I ain't done

The music's hype and if it's alright with you
I wouldn't mind spending the rest of the night with you
No kidding babe we could make some noise
You and your girls me and my boys
Just feelin like a night filled with pleasure
We could take it slow with no presure
Enuough respect,you won't regret
This will be a night you won't soon forget
And thats a promise from me to you
Take my hand girl I'm gonna see you through
You don't stroke me as a woman that fronts

Build up the nerve and switch to second gear.

But tomorrow there's nothing left,
But these two paintings on my wall,
Showing everything we've lost.
And I forget how it ever got this far,
Those nights are never far enough away from me.
Last night the wind became my voice,
But you did all the dreaming for us both.
Last night I didn't have a choice,
Cause you did all the dreaming for us both.
I can't forget,
The way we held on to our pain,
And tried to dry off in the rain.
When we first met,
And all the times we never had,
Those nights are never far enough away from me.

Did anything we ever did make sense?

But I'll be there busting my heat, when there's nuttin' to eat
Fuck it I cheat cus that's the ghettos anthem
I know the devils laughing every time he hears somebody's metal clappin'
Ain't no napping in the city cus it never sleeps
Wake up like what happen when I bust a cap on your feather geez
I led at least a thousand caps, with a thousand raps
With how many acts, actually ever really come out of wax
Just a few I pull this track into best of view
And turn the rest of y'all corn niggaz into vege-tables",Block Party,1998

When they gamble, I tear them like flannel 
You want to battle? You'se a dreamer 
I put up my Benz, you put up your Beamer 
I guarantee ya, I leave ya standin' with your beaper 
Double or nothing, you put up your sneakers and your megaspeakers 
You'll have no sound; while I'll be uptown in your Adidas 
Don't mess with Teachers we pray for peepers

Before you recognize the raw, yo, its right in your face 
Just a little taste, yo I'm kinda nuts like Planters 
The haters save your money cause this album is bananas! 
I'm flashin' just a little style, for a little while 
Been flowin' like the Nile from when you was just a child 
Now its ninety-eight, and I will not hesitate 
You'll be floatin' in the lake, your not no heavyweight! 
Your lightweight, I devastate on the equal races 
No I'm not a racist, but no race could really face this 
I hate this, no I don't, You'll face Kris, no you won't 
You know you broke cause what you want ain't really dope 
Like a billy goat, I ram your set like BLAOW! 
Who cares how you like me now, your on the ground 
Boogie-Down, let me make one thing clear 
BX, baby this is our year 
Try here and die here, superfly here 
As I threw my spear near, think what to do my dear 
I'm new and clear, my clarity's amazing 
Still blazin', played the low on occasion 

We make hotter, JOHN BLAZE 
You niggas rockin' in the WRONG WAYS 
I make your head knock while the SONG PLAYS 
Kid Capri bombs bural (boom!) bombs thorough 
Now you know what you can vibe fuck talkin' your mom's herald 
Let's make it happen, me and you rappin' 
Fuck wack raps, fuck where you sell your cracks at

Heck, you might as well sign over that publishing check 
You ain't worth, my style is ugly and dirty 
If you ain't close to the thirty you really haven't heard of me 
But don't worry, hurry in the clubs I get wit em 
Got styles for the eighties, nineties, and the new millennium 
Only sucker MC's be like Kris got some ish with him

Kid Capri,"Just when you thought it was safe
I came back with the double D clan
Waitin for da man Buckshot, 
Da BDI...general, if I was you I wouldn't try
So many tried so I seen the petty pass by
Listen as I take you on a mission with precision
Like a brown cent went on a hunt
Worldwide searchin for the true ingredients 
To make the pi ?? 6
Shorty want to hound me for a flick
But I got my chips, you gettin visions of my lips
Dicks swang, it don't mean a thang 
'cause when I was down, you was on the other side of town
Getting done by Starang, when he was in range
Now its gettin cold, so you actin kinda strange
Puttin my time to you broke bitches
Don't do shit but stress me out, now I'm back in my riches
To get my blue print down to my very last dot
Every move every motivation that I need
Ain't no hesitation when it comes to rockin when we speak
Just follow my lead on this jou-rney

You never heard another MC like me
Follow my lead on the jour-ney
You never heard another MC like me

Follow my lead on the journey
You never heard another Mc like me
So poetically on point its ridiculous
Hittin every key bassline when I'm rippin this
Don't act like this ain't the shit right now
You know my hits make you want to dance
But you still sittin down
Dumb fucks have a seat and keep your tongue in your throat
And don't bother to quote one note
Or in the mirror you kickin the verse to mine
'cause in the freestyle, you'll be the last to rhyme
This ain't the battle between the two best no more
Survival of the fittest...this shit is war
If you got your eyes open, you can see the light
If you need a guide, follow wit pride...right

[Chorus]
So many people took my lyrics and hooks
If I wrote a book about you crook niggas gettin shook
In a hot second, I'm a get the hot-steppin
On first, when I'm on my verse, niggas need a nurse
Without the kill patient, ain't no hesitation 
Bring your weapon like your military mind 
And steppin on E, times over for you Mc's
All hail to G-O-D's, G-O-D's....

Kid Capri,"Yo Capri  yo this is Diamond  um
Check it out um I moved the session to next Wednesday 
At twelve noon  plug me in at D&D  you'll be outta there by one o'clock 
Aiight? Call me back and umm give me confirmation. 

I'm ageless  pageless  only want me for that thing 
Hang up the phone  wants to let it ring 
Wit my gold chain, nothing as the hangin' rope 
Who want to stay in court plus knowin' the fact that I'm smokey 

Bust you in the back and play the low key 
Trustin' in the fact that where I go, nobody knows me 
Maybe then I'll go to where the weather is more suited to my taste 
And you got, uprooted in the first place 

I got the 'Chelle fire, 'cause I get deeper than Mya 
Stay on shorties domes like them beauty parlor dryers 
Want some verbal spit from the semi-auto lip 
Your whole body get hit, then you start dancin' and 

And I'm the, overweight afro-diesiaic 
I only lick two and pass if your trees be black 
I leave the, promoters screamin' ""Won't you please be back?"" 
Detonating, till bell-bottom Lee's come back

So Brand Nu's, you can make it hot this year 
And Diamond D, you can make it hot this year 
So Brand Nu's, you can make it hot this year

Brand Nu's, you can make it hot this year 
And Diamond D, you're rollin' wit the Kid Capri 

Aight, now here's to y'all all and my new Bronx address 
I'm out wit the old *shit*, got a brand new mattress 
Don't want no girl wit no flat chest 
How 'bout the one wit the ?pack less? 
I tickle you laugh, but I just got the math 
Over on Park Ave, off the concourse on ? 
She took two and, she could do it 
My whole crew got anger's wit them 
Similar to travellin', salesman hittin' things from women 
Or whatever 

Allah Uhakbar, Lord Jamar spit in devil's face like Roberto Alomar 
Choke a Phillie L like Latrell Sprewell 
Straight from the Rochelle where the G-O-D's dwell 
I hope you didn't think that we fell 
We drink from the well, and it never runs dry 
So we never gon die 
We multiply wit mathematics, women's call us charismatic 
Smoke the aromatic, too much, guess it's a habit 

[Chorus]

Here me dog, 'cause a nigga ain't the run of the mill 
Blow up your body at will, like a chick on the pill 
I make it hot to death, swing it from right to left 
'Cause I talk so much shit I can taste it on my breath 
I got the head knock, keep rhyme flows under padlock 
Like comstock, wit more shoes than a Foot Locker 
And it don't stop, Diamond D and Brand Nu 
Baggin more chickens than that nigga Frank Purdue 

No more domestication, on some over-seas shit 
Beat a nigga ass till he says ""please quit"" 
While you home alone marinatin' on cheese sticks 
I'm in the back of the 'Burban wit some Chinese chicks 
Lookin' at a map, one chick on my lap 
Tellin' me how she was born in the year of the rap 
But by the time we reach the house, there's no waitin' in fact 
All you see is ankles (yeah what) from the front to the back

Big shouts to my peoples all over Uptown 
Big shouts to my peoples all over the world 
Brand Nubian, big shouts to Diamond D 
Big shouts to Diggin In The Crates

Kid Capri,"We'd like to welcome y'all to the fabulous Carolina West
I own this motherfucker and my name is Taa-Dow
Y'all niggaz know who I am y'all niggaz tearin up shit
But we got somethin old, and somethin new for y'all tongiht
Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics

[Verse One: Snoop Doggy Dogg]

It's like everywhere I look, and everywhere I go
I'm hearin motherfuckers tryin to steal my flow
But it ain't no thang cause see my nigga Coolio
Put me up on the game when I step through the do'
Ya know, some of these niggaz is so deceptive
Usin my styles like a contraceptive
I hope ya get burnt, it seems ya havn't learnt
It's the nick nack patty wack, I still got the bigger sack
So put your gun away, run away, cuz i'm back (why?)
Hit em up, get em up, spit em up, now
Tell me what's goin on
It make me wanna holler, cuz my dollars come in ozones
Lone for the break-up, so take off your clothes
and quit tryin to spit at my motherfuckin hoes
Seakin of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb cuz I rolled you a joint
You'se a flea and i'm the big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin paws
Y'alls, niggaz, better recognize
And see where I'm comin from it's still East Side till I die
Why ask why? As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-Double-G-Y

It's a crazy mixed up world, it's a Doggy Dogg World
It's a Doggy Dogg World, it's a Doggy Dogg World

[Verse Two: Kurupt]

Well if you give me ten bitches then I'll fuck all ten 
See my homey Snoop Doggy sippin juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm fo' to set trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packin flavor like Life Savors
Ain't that somethin, talk shit and I'm dumpin
I had your whole fuckin block bumpin
Don't sweat, but check the tecnique, I'm unique like China
Ya never find the bomb-a-rama then this Nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
One-two, three, you can't see me
I'm a G like that strapped with hit hard tactics
A fuckin menace, usin hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and poppin
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin
I wanna see some panties droppin
I'm comin from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that hoe
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I'm dishin out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catchin slugs
and I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked
but it's manditory that I kick it
Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin and movin
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head huntin
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massicre from a verbal assassin
Murderin with rhymes packin Tec-9's for some action
You really don't know, do you, you fuckin wit a hog
You can't do me, I'm goin out looney like O-Dog

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Daz]

Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (all night long)
Tell when (till the early morn)
It don't stop (and uh) it don't quit (for the)
The Dogg Pound clique (to drop the cavvy Dogg shit)

Diggity Daz out of the motherfuckin cut once mo'
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip flop and serve hoes with a fat dick
Till I die I'm still screamin that (bitches ain't shit)
Now i'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about 
the city where I'm from, dum diddy dum
As you groove to the gangster shit
The D-O-Double-G the P-O-U-N-D, the gangsta clique
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangsta funk
I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want
So I blaze up the chronic, so I can get high
I promise I'll smoke chronic till the day that I die

",Loud & Clear,1998
Kid Capri,"Yeah once again presenting  
Kid Capri 
Ras Kass the waterproof M.C. 
Punchline 

These fagot M.C's be on skis with the microphone though 
But it's all downhill hitting trees like Sonny Bono 
Name a nigga I couldn't burn and he probably created the Earth in six days 
I shot at Jesus with a tech fives times 
Hanging the pope with six strings  the name is Ras Kass 
Might eat a little pussy but I don't kiss ass homeboy 
I'm righteous and wicked and this acquisition of riches is like 
Selling bean pods and still fucking white bitches 

I rap crazy, you better get fifty niggas to blaze me 
Or ace me, been rhyming since 220 AD 
You feel gazy?, I'm top ten with the raps 
Off the list you scratch, like serial numbers on gats 
I lace tracks with ill lines 20 bar rhymes 
My verses got long sentences like jail times 
Press rewind, listen to jams when I cool out 
I only fuck a bitch in the park if she juiced out 
Going new routes to maintain my composure 
Anticipated while you still screaming to get exposure 
Rap soldier in the cipher I'm first to set it 
My lyrics get the U.S. Open without playing tennis 

Vindictive my voice pitch is beyond John Blaze 
I'm John Cremation, you conversation with aspirations 
Of me leaving blood stains from Earth to Venus 
Them so-called rap stars will still be living 
with they moma like an unborn fetus 
As soon as you step on stage I'ma destroy you with the truth 
Like the Ricki Lake show, don't come out the soundproof booth 
Or poof, plucked in your bubblegoose 
A lost angel, I strangle at an angle that's obtuse 

Yo, my styles viscous, put niggas before bitches 
Collect riches, bone chickens without trickin' 
And stay spitting mad rhymes in your direction 
Always repping get you open like seasections 
I rhyme greata set it off without Jada 
My flava' leave a nigga shook like vibrators 
Rap composer of the hit your styles over 
I make an M.C. cry just like Robin on Ophra 
Give you the cold shoulder guess who rhymes slicker 
I gross figures, shed light on shady niggas 
And write rhymes, roast niggas that take mine 
Gave birth to so many styles I should have my tubes tied 
One time, when rappers need concentration 
Embarrass I nigga, like getting caught masterbating 
I'm fascinating, I make you wallow in your sorrow 
Clutch the bottle you get your childish style fondled 
My rap tactics make you want to go home and practice 
Match this, drop jewels like Biago Rackis 
I come rough for all niggas that front 
I'm all that five mics and quotable for the month 

I be on some bullshit like the unamits and vigorous rhyming 
And until Buchwhick Bill starts dunking on Kobe Bryant 
I'm applying pressure, check out my melody 
The eighteenth letter, the first letter 
the nineteenth letter for cheddar 
And get a barrette explosive tip shredders to make the rum-redder 
To make the deader then Coretta 
Scott King's husband who had a dream 
I get in you with no Vaseline 
And burn rubber so I tap that ass like Savion Glover  

That the sedative cause your shits repetitive 
And played out, tried to run game but it got rained out 
Wasn't thinking about this style until we came out 
Took a detour when some of y'all went the same route 
Thoughts about doing Punchline make me tickle 
When my flow changes like pennies, dimes and nickels 
Organized rhymes we make the girls realize 
We humiliate niggas like a small dick size 
Now you want to click nines, front and sip wines 
Take mine, can't mess with Ras and Punchline",One on One,1998

The whole city's under siege when we come through wit guns blazin
You need to take a seat son, you just started shavin
Respect ya elders, stay in a child's play
The monotone flow stayin even wit the bass
Oh good Lord, we throw it like a javelin toss
Arrogance is the feature that we added for floss
Come and get headline, destined to get riches
From either rappin our ass off or brick shipments
Cover all regions, makin sure the protty gets spread out
We talk behind the mac you bust lead out
Wit next prospect, no particular concept do we follow
Smooth but yet solid like marble

[Diamond]
Niggas ain't fuckin wit D, fuckin wit me
Lookin at me like ""Yo, what can it be?""
In the wide body-7 while you suckin the D
Spent out in the wedge while I'm fuckin for free
Scared to death like you stuck in a tree
I'ma stretch your ass out like I'm cuttin the deed
Frontin like a big man but you stuck in a three
So you know your floss game ain't nuttin to me
When the sun hits the cross, yo it's something to see
are-be	, Kid Capri niggas runnin wit me
Twenty karats on the wrist ain't nuttin to me
Do you know good frontin to me, nigga

[Kid Capri]
Aiyyo Tone, let's Touch these niggas wit the wand
Then blow up like a bomb
Made moves faster than the autobond
The Kid Capri is a institution, and all ya'll niggas is pollution
Starin up a whole lot of confusion
It's simple, let's move out all these corn cats
And disc jock dissin MC's that got the borin raps
Fuck what ya got, grimy niggas don't want to hear it
Niggas take it, soon as they near it, you better fear it
Bronx Bomber, the pretty-fly girl charmer
The black Italian, the cash keep pilin as I'm smilin
So hear me now, I bring the thunder plus the rumble
And I'll step back and watch your whole career just crumble

[AG]
Well it's the cheeba steamer, brains on trains, won't eat her neither
Benz to the plane, off the plane to the Beemer
Insane and off the meter, in the rain I'll heat up
And ya'll can't stop my sunshine, fuck one-time
Got heavy wit gats to push your face back
Trash-ass album sound like you played it on eight-track
Rip you from the roots and under
Triple gooses in the summer
Mean long guns is producin the thunder
Convertible Hummers, we shit on the glock
Try to put the roof up, I'll tell Show to piss on the top
Wrist on the watch, roll wit a click or a glock
Plan on gettin a lot, from spittin or not
Cool wit niggas that be flippin a lot
Probably got shit on your block
And if you hate, I'll take it back to '88 (Nigga, get off the top)
It's two-g's, let's get this money, you wit it or not
But I'll switch topics like my bitch wit thongs in the tropics
Make hits, straight hits
Perform as long as I got it
Seven-digits wit my name on the dotted
Remain Dirty and potted, ya'll know me for the ruckus
G.D. I only can fuck wit
Get the dutch and tell Tony to Touch it

[Party Artie]
Guns, I tote them things
Blunts, I smoke them things
Rhymes, I wrote them things
It's no such thing, as hoes fron-ting
We run train, I do my thug thing
Grab the mic and leave a mud stain
So get Tide wit bleach when I rhyme wit beats
Niggas do crimes to eat
No pork, I don't talk, the nines just speak
I'm the kind to creep on your block wit the heat cocked
Got the street locked, smackin niggas out they Reeboks
It's Party Artie, I get dirty wit the Ewoks
The infrared hit you in the head from three blocks
Away, Been There Done That like Dr. Dre
It Ain't My Fault like Silkk the Shocker say
Ya'll niggas gots to pay, shots'll spray
From the Bronx to Far Rock away
My whole team, strapped like Bokeem
Fuck bein in jail, trapped wit no cream

[Lord Finesse]
I be the don that's known to have the style sewn
More cheese than calzones, give chicks the dialtone
Build like brownstones when we slaughter your plan
Touch albums, so hot comes wit a portable fan
Type to starve the mic when I hog the light
Lay my life on the lines if the odds is right
Gettin the, spot and gleam while you plot and scheme
To stop the team, three words nigga: watch and dream
You just mad hater, 'cause we movin wit dough
You don't make sense like wearin suede shoes in the snow
Finesse frontin? why'all know me, I don't stress nuttin
Bought your album, that's how I broke the eject button
Don't stress dudes, we just plot our next move
Make niggas look stupid like joggin pants wit dress shoes
The prophet, shit john blaze like the tropics
Type of nigga need a ? just for my pockets
Don't flex punks, we sex stunts, collect lumps
You flossin now, you be pardon by next month

Couldn't drink the Henny straight, I needed somethin to chase 
Nowadays I throw shots back, leavin nuttin to waste
Life's like a treadmill, niggas runnin in place

I vowed to never stop winnin, 'til the earth stop spinnin
Rock hot linen, cop hot cars and hot women
If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not rememberin
My motto is simply I will not lose
Abide by the block rules, I buy my glocks used
wit bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?
I'm raised, illrational, way misunderstood
If you ain't live like I live, been one with the hood
I done what I could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still
Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature
If hell awaits a, nigga I'm comin with the razors
Still flashin ya shit, try to pass me in a six
Type classy on the wrists, every bit of 30 karats

Let's celebrate New York, around the world, and
Yo, Ghostface, go in heavy, man, let's do it

[Chorus 1: Ghostface Killah (Rare Earth ""I Just Want to Celebrate"" sample)]
(I just want to celebrate) Like my squad won the Super Bowl
(I just want to celebrate) Like we bangin on New Years Eve yall
(I just want to celebrate) Like we just beat trial
(I just want to celebrate) We hype for just bein here

[Ghostface Killah]
Stones on every arm, the crib is ten million
The corks from Dom Perignon can't reach my ceiling
Four maids with four grenades
When the sun's in my face, all I do is lower the walls for shade
The pool's a pain in the ass, fifty grand on Windex kid
They keep it clean the whole bottom is glass
So you can see the sharks and piranhas, a pair of pajamas
That's my neighbor, the faggot disrespecting my mama
No cars in the garage, it's underground shit
They way the floor open up you think I'm hiding spaceships
French chefs, the best grapes on they breath
Louie aprons on the Yank cats, the puffy cooks the rest
Besides I got birds that never leave the nest
They fuck with me, I'll watch em confess, then I'll go rest
Get back up deposit them checks
Muthafuckas fuckin up a good time by snappin your necks, come on

We can to party, run out of Goose we got Dollies
Shorties wettin me, check out her body, uhh
Throw up your hands like it's your birthda, mommy
Let's celebrate, now I got her girlfriends behind me
Now I'm in the middle, watch is all chiseled
I can holla at the birds like Dr. Dolittle
(What's that in your pocket Ghost?) a Dill pickle
(Not that) oh that's the forty-five stainless nickel
I'm pullin a green, gotta G for the biggest ass
On the floor who look right in them jeans
If you fat, I might take one for the team
But I gotta get drunk first knowhatimean, come on

Na-na-na-na-nah, you can't catch me
I'm out like Thomas in, in a five-fifty
Police be fiendin to frisk me
I'm so legit I walk away with the car keys pissy
Back at the labo, shorty wop need a Dutch
He fuckin wit a Goose dick, tonight I'ma beat it up
Your thing to wet, you sure you ain't seeded up
(That's how I get Ghost, especially when you eat it up)
My goodness gracious, ass is flirtatious
Move it around like a snake miss or sexy waitress
Ghost don't have no patience
I like you, I usually change chicks like radio stations
I'm, definitely not lookin for love
But if you give it to me right now I might say I was
You can chill if you want I got crazy bud
But before we do what it do, go jump in the tub, come on

I sure bet my daddy proud,
A little nigga with a shaker smile,
On top of the dreams is where I'm found.
Some figured I was Satan-bound,
Until I came back with the style I found,
Then all of the sudden they fixed they're faces
Cause of who I know, and the trail of places,
That I've stepped, how many niggas wanna hate cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack,
Cause I'm risking my soul attack, now I'm heard all over the map.
Only rule of thumb, it don't really matter just where you from,
All that really matter is where you're goin' go,
Baby I'm stayin' for somethin',
But you can't rule out this caps of gun
Second chances givin' out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage,
Then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage,
Done pimpin' you can think about marriage,
Until then get it in,
Find yourself and let's begin,
I'm a tell you how in a minute,
I'm a show you how I be livin'
From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid,
Now I'm in the zone, seein' things so vivid,
I'm a soul, nah homie, not even,
I'm a zone now till I lose feeling,
Remember I'm a be gone way past November,
Even stay up there, up there, floatin', floatin', hopin' I could find peace somewhere.

In my mind, it sounds like ooh,
When I'm gone it feels like ooh,
When I'm zoned, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright I forget about it all.

Ballin', is this allowed?
Without feeling like Shallow Hal,
Diamonds on the Jesus peace for style,
Back into the city right around,
Greetin' my niggas with dap 'n' pounds,
So if I fall I won't hit the ground,
These are the things that a make me smile,
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while,
I keep myself so lifted,
I am accustomed to new heights,
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless,
See what I might flight, man
Everybody wanna be a critic I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
How are my jokes? They will love it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans,
More than likely I am faded man
Doin' other shit get ready where you goin',
Niggas just stand around hatin'
So my vice ace is when
The lights start flashin' 'n' I'll be soaring all alone 'n',
In the place my mind is going fill with songs and no-ones knowin'
And the devil with the harpin' dress tryin' ask me for one dance,
He think he slick but my guardians protects me from his wrath,
So in my place no hate shall enter, livin' high up there up there
Copin', copin', floatin', I will find peace somewhere

In my mind, it sounds like ooh
When I'm gone, it feels it likes ooh

This is easy, Sunday morning
We're right here on a beautiful morning in Cleveland, Ohio
And it's chilly today, the kids are going to school
The grass is frosty
Let's take it on, on the ride-ide out, in the morning
Hello Cleveland

A nigga like me be so gone
Eyes so low that a nigga gotta throw his locs on
""Wonder what them folks on?"" That's what they be asking
That kush we smokes on, smell it when a nigga pass and
We getting to the cash and, you can see a nigga shining
Just a little gold, a couple hoes, couple two, three diamonds
Up in the hood where you find 'em, unless he out on the road
Every show got a bag full of blow and Patron
All my niggas getting throwed like they 'posed to
'Cause life is short and filled with lots of grief and doubt
So I just pull that bag of colorful frosty leaves
On out and free my scalp
I need to free my mind, a puff at a time
I'm up all the time, I'm up on the grind
So a Red Bull and a blunt would be fine
Just wanna feel fine, just wanna kill time
Just wanna relax and think of a rhyme
Dont really like sipping 'cause I get to tripping
My nigga just roll up a heap of that pine
And only bring a lil bit for the trip
Just in case we get blurped by the 5-0
""Sir you look high""
""I know, but I prefer my eyes low""

And we get higher, and higher, and higher, and higher
And we get higher, and higher, and higher, and higher
You know we get higher, and higher, and higher, and higher
You know we get higher, so higher, oh, oh yeah we get so high

Yeah, they say easy friend
There he go talking about weed again
Probably 'cause all that weed in him, yes and no
Cause and effect is what most don't know
Doing bad or like Mike said could be doing wrong
Forget about the obvious context of song
Put your brain where it belong
Can't we just all get a bong and tag along?
And we float, we kids with hope
Better to cope when you smoke
Dawg, please don't miss what
A nigga trying to get you thinking about
We outside because my mama in the house
Puff puff pass with your bitch ass
Back in high school, smoked weed when I cut class
And now I'm an addict
Tragic, stay rolling up while reclining
I be looking down see my Jesus piece shining
Good look Yeezy, now I stay blinded by that light
Somebody pass me that shell to the right
Yes, I'm going, I'll be outtie, and you can find me
I'll be chilling back, I'll be chilling Jack
Let's go

And we get higher, and higher, and higher, and higher
And we get higher, and higher, and higher, and higher
You know we get higher, and higher, and higher, and higher

Long before we know ourselves,
Our paths are already set in stone.
Some may never figure out their purpose in life,
And some will.
There are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in,
Content with being blinded by rules and judgment.
We live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead.
In this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to.
Being a leader in this day and age is being a threat.
Not many people stood up against the system we all call life,
But toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice.
A voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time.
A voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions
And issues never before heard so vividly and honest.
This is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself,
But his dreams too.
This is the story of The Man On The Moon.",In My Dreams [Cudder Anthem],2009

If you hear you can feel it too,
Somethin' special I am runnin' to,
'Till then I go, away very far away,
To another universe where all the people say,
Its the new new place for the special to embrace,

Wandered out the place,
Take what you need from the valley of the hopeful,
Even if you drown you'll be floatin' higher above it,
You can say bye bye bye,
Sky might be fallin' but remember you can fly high.

Kid Cudi,"I got ninety nine problems and they all bitches
Wish I was Jigga man, carefree living
But I'm not Shawn or Martin Louie
I'm the Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys
You know how I be when you start livin' large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram'
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself, why he by himself?
He got two older brothers, one hood, one good
An independent older sister got me fly when she could
But they all didn't see,
The little bit of sadness in me, Scotty

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you
It's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life (yeah, yeah)
The soundtrack to my life

I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of 'shrooms just so I could see the universe
I tried to think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room and soon I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancun
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right, I try to shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand, fam'

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you
It's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life
The soundtrack to my life

I was close to go and trying some coke
And a happy ending would be slitting my throat
Ignorance the cope man
Ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love, and I need that shit
If I never did shows, then I'd probably be a myth
If I cared about the blogs, then I'd probably be a jack-ass
Don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see thirty
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry
Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down, pussy and some Cali tree
And I get both, never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you
It's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life,
The soundtrack to my life
To my life
To my life

Once upon a time baby, 
I once had a dream so sweet until I had a taste of you, 
Once upon a time baby,

Reaching out to hold your close so I don't slip away, 
Explore a new approach, 
A whole new free I say

But it's easier to just do, 
See, if you can't do what you imagine, 
Then what is imagination to you?

To take the place of hate, 
Or things all the same, 
Tell me your secrets 
The things that make you tick, 
I like it when you talk 
Because your voice is angel'esk (aye), 
I want to kiss you on your space below your naval-et, 
The taste that you keep neat, so moist like a towelette, 
This will mark the day our minds and souls will connect, 
Let's not forget the sex,

Long before we know ourselves,
Our paths are already set in stone.
Some may never figure out their purpose in life,
And some will.
There are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in,
Content with being blinded by rules and judgment.
We live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead.
In this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to.
Being a leader in this day and age is being a threat.
Not many people stood up against the system we all call life,
But toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice.
A voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time.
A voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions
And issues never before heard so vividly and honest.
This is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself,
But his dreams too.
This is the story of The Man On The Moon.",In My Dreams (Cudder Anthem),2009

But get me to my fans,
I'm country till decease
Please,
I stay up on my creep so to come up
Gotta look the part superstar, no stunnas
I'mma say some shit that make you think I lost my mind
I'm the only nigga that could watch the sun and don't go blind
She fine as she wannabe
But she wanna check though
Dodging popping pictures,
Like the hoes was working with the law
Back in Shaker bitches tried to play me to the left
Now I pick the hoes I want,
And give my niggas what is left
I don't know if it's the name or the bake on bottoms
Keep them on sleep them 501's
You can't knock 'em
Use to have the Honda with the 30 day tags
That was in the past
Now I'm bout to throw 'em on the Jag

I teach her the son that never gave a fuck about a scantron
All I wanted was to be a human being
And show the world some new colors and scene
Imagine all types of beautiful scenery
I remember when I first had tree smoked
Black and Mild, how dumb of me now,
I'm grape cigarello man
Any young black kid a guaranteed fan
On a downhill grind and I'm humble

Don't focus where you been G, focus where you trying to go!

Snow man old man when you trying to shine like gold
When its my time to blow partner I'mma know
In the mist getting dough I was here with highs and lows
My Melo tried to play me like my fucking eyes was closed
Now I'm sittin here wishing that my guys didn't know
They love a G, so they despise a soul
What they gon' do to him, beyond my control
When the reaper calls, it's your time to go
Never play a nigga when you see that he is tying to grow
Candy blocker when he knocked out ?
Empty chamber so I'm watching every angle
Under the moonlight with he devil I tangle
Church on the move like Jesus in the manger
Better control the money, it's better to control the anger
So now I watch a friend the way I watch a stranger

Chilling rolling up something to change my feeling
Thinkin' about how I came up from nothing while I'm
Splitting this cigarillo, phone rings I get a call
One of my dogs tripping hard talkin' about really killin' them all
I say slow down, slow down
What the fuck you mean nigga
Just ran to your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
I'll be there in 20 minutes but it only took fifteen
We wasn't that tight but cool enough for me to hit the scene
No knowing that this was all a set up
Secretly they want me wet up
Jealous of my future cheddar, however
They passes move was to slow for me
I pulled up, wasn't no ambulance, there wasn't no police
Something fishy going on, not even kept pressing on
Nine gripped thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
Opened the front door they shot, I shot, some abrupt shit
The nigga with something to lose almost lost it, won't trust him again

Will rock tee's, 300 a pop for these
Please bum me, you don't owe you money
They ignite got flipped and I got blow for a grip
Sipping on a Heinie with my Jamie boo besides me
That's my fucking best friend
When I be tweaking she be calming a brother
Like the touch from a mother
I am so damn comfortable I never want to leave it
The feeling is something like a spiritual healer
That could end me, I think that's the part I find intriguing
A little bit off I am, I am, I am

My body won't let me fall victim no more
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My body won't let me fall victim no more

Yeah life is like that, beat me up
And I'm fighting right back
Poof poof be gone, I see the devil linger on,
Yeah I wanna win,
As long as I can do the work within,
Lord let me in,
I feel like you're my only friend.

Liquor all night love it!
Untamed youth and coupes move like bullets
I guess the fact my father smoked 
And drank made it a young nigga destiny to do the exact same
Young wild'n me and all my codi's
Watch the phonies and hoes they claim they blew me
Dark skinned china dog with the fake tits
Ice grillin' my Spanish chick, word
We all in together now we all fear cops be buggin'
Shotguns on the whip, 
Fuck 'em
I will never sweat for a piggy
You catch me high it's all good no biggie

Four in the morning getting cosy
So much goose, I let the fry soak it up some
Tuesday weekly, the legend of the rager
Most have witnessed the Cud' in the club
I don't have Plain Pat ready
Ice is thrown and the whole crew gone
Done off the better, girls they love it, totally
Fuck the blogs, I'mma tell my story
No matter the phase, my name is engraved
In the minds of the young
To be living 'til their grave
You live and you learn
Doing bumps in the day
Keep blunts to burn

[Chorus: x2]

Rage, cause I'm paid
Take the gray and create another shade
Awesome no more bitches playin' possum
Pop and lock em and send em on home
Tired of hoes all they want is to get chose
Know the code when a women with some toes
Optimo's taking trips to Australia
Do some blow if you make through the show
Hands high,
Go with your soul and try floating through the sky
Hide your pain with some pussy and mimosas
Costa Rica next on the agenda

Calls some hos up and get some cudi cudi

Mines is kinda tight
A long way from hustlin' a china white
My people love the fans love me come all go
If you aint showin love than what you call for
I don't need it in my life
My kids pay the price
Sorta like the need of my wife
Smoke til I'm gone dog on the throne
I'm worldwide known I'm a boss in the zone
I get it how I get it cause I can
I earn my spot, you see the plan
I'm just fuckin' with my fans
I turned out to be the better man
Important to life you understand while I'm puffin on this gram

Everythin' I'm havin'
No they ain't necessity
Though I'm shinin' keep on grindin'
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them hoes don't love them hoes

Got little money dog but I ain't tripping,
Most days I'm faded, feeling ex-rated,
Steady wanting freaky hoes, then I want a lady,
Holdin' the fam down and the clothes on me,
The people who were there, stupid sucka left me lonely,
Phony, when you see me nigga, don't approach me,
Made it to the top baby, that's on me,
Cops trying to claim that they made me,
I want you to feel another real for gaizing,
I keep it one hundred, never frontin', don't need me,
I'm in the zone, no place for pussy my nigga,
Cool yo that niggas don't know, loco how a nigga like me postpone,
The one fans loved, who was always approachable yo,
And I rep the double O, smoking, eating Cheerios

Can't forget it, they made me who I am, a king,
And I'm still on the scene you gotta love it, all out in public,
The people want to touch it, I need a blunt with the stuffin',
Nigga, it's nothin' for me to chill out and post up at the house,
With Madden on the screen and smash on the homies,
Hollywood nice now,
Everyone want me and on the blogs they talk shit like they know me,
Fool, I'll take you niggas to school, ""How to get rich and stay cool"",
Snoopy D O Dub show you homie, even with the critics and feds on me,
I was tappin' all the Choanies,
Dog, but my folks call me snoopy, boss dogg nigga sue me,
Pony tail swinging as I lay in the jacuzzi,

Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I've dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and
Tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative

This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno' who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?

I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Is hip hop, just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo's smilin' they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't running shootin' a jump or running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a southpark writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas cant resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever one of the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!

I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparal girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said ""take them glasses off and get in the pool""
It's been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a crip said,
""I got way too many blues for any more bad news""
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
But God said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It ain't funny anymore try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it,
do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic
Endening that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it!?
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, its like that y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it

I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Aye yo
I don't cop Timbs, that's lived in lenses
Kid, Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benz's
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off the jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nike's
Throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
Got made code red
Bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying
You give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

Have you ever felt like you’re living in a spot light

Where you can’t even trust a smile

There are lonely nights when you see no hope
And you’re feeling short of breath
Like a whole damn world is a braided rope
In a noose around your neck

Don’t kick the chair
It’s gonna get better
Don’t kick the chair
It can only get better

Have you ever felt love, really really felt love
The kind that could save a life
But right before you know it you find out in a moment
You’re gonna have to say goodbye

There are lonely nights when you see no hope
And you’re feeling short of breath
Like a whole damn world is a braided rope
In a noose around your neck

Don’t kick the chair

Don’t kick the chair
It can only get better

If I can make it through then you can to
Yep yep I’m good focus like always
Feels like I’ve been hit hit hit by ten brick walls

Kid Cudi,"Knock knock cudi open up dis Chip
Gotta kush pack shells 
And some henni we could sip
Keep a couple dolla's on
Give a penny to b****
But I'm wit' a couple ho's
Who said they really wanna get
Acquainted with some n****s
Who, ain't the average n****s
They just wanna see why 
All they girlfriends be wanting pictures
I be flier then a hundred natts
Worth a hundred hundred stacks
I ain't gonna stop shoppin'
Till I hit a hundred sacks
Although that's a given 
I ain't even gotta mint chain

Put you n****s in detention
Slabbed n****s geeked up

Fool wit' some gold

And I ain't even gotta tell a lie
My swag, my steez gotta n**** sky high
So I'm, watchin' my moves
From the shoes on the cool
Be damned if a n**** ain't high to the roof
Pimp tight get it right homey more or less
Gotta thank god I'm fresh

Oh I rearrange faces when I drop,
I'm super duper cudi,
Candy paint the rag top
Can't nobody even tell I'm sippin' when I lean
but get me to my fans,
I'm country till decease
Please,
I stay up on my creep so to come up
Gotta look the part superstar, no stunnas
I'm a say some s*** that make you think I lost my mind
I'm the only n**** that could watch the sun and don't go blind
She fine as she wannabe
But she wanna check though
Dodging and popping pictures,
Like the hoes was working with the law
Back and shaker pictures, tryna play me to the left
Now I pick the hoes I want,
And give my n****s what is left
I don't know if it's the name or the bake on bottoms
Keep them on sleep them 501's
You can't knock em
Use ta have the Honda with the 30 day tags

In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand
I know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life you'd understand
But, I can't fold, some poor soul got it way worse
We're all troubled, in a world of trouble
It's scary to have a kid walk this Earth
I'm what you made God, fuck yes I'm so odd
Thinking 'bout all my old friends who weren't my friends all along
Hm, when it rains it pours, whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
Everyday to find sane's a chore, amidst a dream with no exit doors

Kid Cudi,"Coming from a city where bullets turn bro's into souls
Who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose
Good girls stopped being good when I turned 'em into hos
Dreams stopped being dreams when I turned 'em into goals
BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was Illmatic
Then I saw Kanye's hanging from his gold necklace
Then Ye gave me mine, that show you my work ethic
Mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt
Used to pick me up from school right after work
Now she rolling up in that Caddy like she coming to church
She's ask why I rock all this gold, cause I'm coming in first
Got the streets behind me like I was staring in the rear view
Used to have to take showers standing in the mildew
Now I'm in the penthouse, look what a mill do
Looking in the mirror and I'm still you, I'm still you

Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

BIG was the first one that had it
Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

What's the noise all about with this rap stuff
I can say I never been punked, robbed or smacked up
I can say I never been chased, jumped or backed up
I learned to patch it up to get passes to niggas who be acting up
Cause it's a mental game, I learned that when I got my first initial chain
I didn't fake it, it was gold plated, I was posing relatin'
To those dealing with blow, had the big gold bow acres it was those gangsters
That bonus, that culture, those projects
Shiny shit on their necks, making both of my eyes squint
They got in my bones, now I'm coppin' stones
Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs
18 karat gold Cuban on, not too short, not too wide, not too long
My pendant offensive, in the truest form
Platinum gold, rose gold, what you want?

Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic
And I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

On a highway to heaven, look at all the tolls I paid
I done gave my city drive all the roads I paved
No matter what why I turn things go my way
I'm rocking chains everyday, so you know I slave
Even when I'm just walking 'round the crib, nigga
To remind me of everything that we did, nigga
Look up in the mirror, chain only thing lyin'
No heroes where I'm from, bullets only thing flying
I know the higher that I go, the harder to climb
But after that, the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind
Police only work 12-hour shifts
Cause in Detroit that's cheaper than the bailout, bitch
Trap house built brick by brick, paid dues on dues
FF good, you know I'm reppin' crew on crews
Stack bills on bills till my backyards got pools on pools
Girls on girls, lingerie and Moulin Rouge
God damn, I think I'm gon' O.D.
Off this asparagus and bread and pasta
Need a doctor, I've been dogding shady hoes and rainy days
It's like I got a built-in doppler
And it's a shame, a fuckin' shame
I don't remember my first love or my first time prayin'
But remember my first ass and the first time she came
It almost felt as good as when I got my first chain

Got my first chain
When I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

Jay-Z taught me money ain't a thing
Came from the streets, headed to the hall of fame
And I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
Stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

It's such a wonderful thing, to see the end of all things
Niggas and bitches, where you at?
I got my mind is on me
A couple others and dreams, would've seen me
Me and my niggas in this bitch
About two months in a week's time
Movin, feelin hellish to dolly with lemon, lime shine
Now how the fuck can I chill now?
Kanye think I'm dope
See this piece that I own now
How sick is the rope?
Taking life for what it is
The troublesome chick, who throws fists
Sometimes it's the weather
Things switch up, people trip up
The money come down, then climb up
But when it come again
The most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin'
Saying that you love me, you surely do and if you don't
Motherfuck that sometimes
So dead it, shred it
Young nigga lost to the night
I'm so ready to let it go
My life is fucking awesome, I could be fuckin' dead right now
But I'm awesome
So fuck whoever has a bad thought
Don't know the god
Cause when I leave this bitch you all gon' wish you knew the god
It might be too late, but the song's will live on
Just know this fact, you were all wrong
Now watch me do my silly dance
Not really a dance, more like a prance
I'm signing off with a crotch grab

Thank you man, for letting me get on this record Sean
You the coolest
G.O.O.D. music nigga forever
Understand?

Kid Cudi,"I am the smartest man alive!

I tried to tell all my friends when I was a kid that I had powers
And nobody wanted to believe me
Alright

Spent the last month feeling bad 'bout myself
I couldn't speak anything of real hope
And the day came when it hit me like lightning through my veins
A sudden change in my groove, in my walk
I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
It's like the city is mine and the dark is my cave
I can't explain this sudden peace in my walk, I sure hope

I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal
Tonight I feel immortal

Bet you want to see me weak
Not sort of my thing you see
I'm too damn cool, my mojo too dope
It's the same old thing getting lost Day N' Nite, young and lost in the pain
So many times I've broke this vicious cycle
I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
Surely I'mma do what I want, ain't got no one to blame
I can't explain this sudden peace in my walk, I sure hope

I'm living my life as if I got powers

Demolition expert, I exert through your network while the tech squirt jerk
There's holes inside your sweatshirt
Through your apparel, through your blood, through your bone marrow
Precise with this mic device, slice your pie like Sbarros
You falling nigga, and you can't get up
You been stalling motherfucker now your ass is stuck
Brooklyn, Brownsville, baby stay with the Killer Hill crazy
It grows up above the booth
And conceals my three eighty
Are you running for this money money
Hunting eggs like Easter bunny
Geeks trying to beast upon me
Freak, I will eat a zombie
Calm and double while you jumping through these hurdles
Silly rabbit the race is always won by the turtle
Metal machinery, purple herbal mixed with that greenery
I don’t write songs, grasshopper, I write scenaries
Everything ain’t what it seems to be
What it means to you it don’t mean to me
Bzzzz, a sting from the killer bees

Never blue for the mistress
Life is good, I live every day like it's Christmas
Happy New Year, I does what the fuck I wanna do here
I splash that Gucci shit from the shirt to the shoewear
Trust the rings out, wife beater tee with the wings out
Long dick stamina, I fuck a bird til she sings out
La la la la, body could convert Lady Gaga
Back to heterosexual, I'm classy like Impala
Plus I'm federal, when it comes to making dollas
Like Jigga nigga man, if you hear me then holla
Four rings like the Green Lantern
You see me in the mean phantom
Pushing over there in Ohio, outside of Canton
Or maybe in the Grotti rugged projects of Staten
Tall redbone in my shower, she looking like Paula Patton

So for the blunted, then they pickin the gun up
Motherfuckers is trippin' if it in in the run up

Focused to keep the pockets replenished
Clothes on our kids
And keep my niggas from goin' away on a bid
Only wanted fly shit when we got big
Chasin' these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
Beat niggas up so bout it bout it they go blind about it

So many things people wanna limit you to be
I show you a glimmer inside the spectrum of the wizard
Well known as a getter and a nigga with a plan
The negative that come out they mouth, so sad
When I smash wipe the smirk off their face, my bad
Who bad? I am, my dad raised one hell of a man
At eleven I had to throw on the pants
Still don't feel appreciated and not by my own fam
All good, I'll be tucked away in them shadows
Workin' in sweats solve the riddle and soon I'm ready for battle
Move my fans with my love and they move me with theirs
We unified by the dark and middle fingers in air
Come on who gon' go half on a zone
Oh, thought I would be done off the coke, no
Let me tell you something ho
Been said everything that shine ain't gold
Been skeetin' on pretty faces then my heart switched cold
Been the nigga sittin' in hell in fresh ass clothes
I know what it feels like to have a broken nose
And ain't nobody hit you in it
It's really cause that shit that you snorted and put all in it
That time you thought I was finished no I just experimented
And it helped me adjust and be OK, with being demented
By the way nigga these cars ain't rented I give a fuck who sees
So I don't bother rollin' tinted look who the fuck it be
That skinny Cleveland niggie I stay reppin' my city bitch
Been smokin' no jokin' cudder’s had that itch
So I scratch, so please no more speculation 'bout that

I’m back so please no more speculation 'bout that

Can't fuck with an unstoppable force

I live for the day to watch all you pussies roast
Whoosah whoosah, so I don't slit nobody throat
Aw it ain’t my fault, homie thought he had the juice
Bash a nigga face in, watch the blood leak

And I am not a fronter, better look up the facts
The world know what it be
Mr. Rager, Solo Dolo see me and repeat it

Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 other nuns
God blessed my tongue, God need it for life
Awkward like car rides, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?

I really want it I need it
Break bread or break fast
Before I blast and break legs, ride past
And they scream out ""little Johnny is dead!""
You wish me well, I wish you hell
Eternity, no such thing as time will tell
Infirmary, burn like magnetic combustion
Bad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin'
What's the definition of water?
Sherm sticks, simply got 'em everywhere you caught us
Turn quick, I don't wanna play this for my daughter
And if my son heard it, probably look at you as his father
I'm proud of myself in a bad way
Halfway house, tell that to me halfway
I'm passin' out, ass whoopin'
Your ass lookin' for Michelle Obama 'til I bang on you
They couldn't

Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 other nuns
God blessed my tongue, God need it for life
Awkward like car rides, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?","Solo Dolo, Pt. 2",2013

Kid Frost,"Intro:
[Frost]: This is a dramatization. The names have been changed to protect
the innocent ones not involved in the stories I'm about to tell. So 
listen up and listen up well. Here are the true accounts and incidents 
and still to me, it makes no sense. Ignorance is a major role, but 
here's a fact I feel you can ignore no more. 

Verse One:  Frost

Homicide, on the murder scene
Another frustrated gang-related senseless slaying
Victim: a young product of the project system
The sad fact is nobody's gonna miss him
True, a few may stand in disbelief, but
The majority will sigh a relief
Because of the fact he was a menace to society
And gang violence was his first priority
So, now you take a look to see what this abouta
Someone quicka with the trigga, straight cold shot him
Dead, in a puddle of blood he lay,
Another typical day in the streets of L. A. 

Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene

Verse Two:  Frost
Ho-Homicide, and just for trying to act brave
Tryin' to be a hero sent you to a early grave
The violent death, it took place at around six
And eyewitnesses say that it went like this, 
There was this lady who was chillin' in a alley
Positive I.D. included that her name was Sally
Sally had just got off the bus from a job,
When she met three young thugs who decided to rob
A man heard the screams comin' from her mouth
Ran down the deserted alley just to check it out
And when he came across the scene,
He knew what was happenin', but by then it was too late
The thugs started blastin'
Now, asked in this situation, exactly what would you do?
If you heard someone screaming, would you go to the rescue?
My man, he tried, that's hwo he died
He was shot right between the eyes
Tryin' to do a good deed, shoot, that could've been me
I'm glad I'm not the one who must explain this to his family

Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder 
scene 
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Break it down!

Verse Three:  Frost
Homicide, it's also know as manslaughter
It can be a father, mother, son, or daughter
It can happen at anyplace, at anytime
It can happen as I'm runnin' down this rhyme
First degree murder, blood flows red
One day you're alive, the next day, you're dead
Nobody seen nothin', the suspect fled
Shot on the spot with a bullet to the head
As soon as it happened, everybody broke
Nobody seen nothin', and of course nobody spoke
Bein' questioned, it doesn't pay to rat-a-tat-tat
For if you rat, you might too get the gat,
And get added to the list of those who fatally died
In the statistics, that's known as homicide

Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder

Yo soy chingon ese, like Al Capone ese

Tu no sabes nada why yo vienes halo
Been hit in the head too many times with the palos
Still you trying to act cool, but you should know
You're so cool that I'ma call you a culo
You're just a pee wee, you can't get it ever
You're a leva
Your own barrio doesn't back you up
They just look at your ass and call you a pool butt
And so I look and I laugh and say que pasa

Cruising in the calle, headed for the bolo
No want to go with me, so I had to go solo
And when I go out alone I'm packed
I touch all that chavalas when they know that I'm strapped
Every time that I pack my piece
I pull it out quick all the nonsense desease
Just like the song when you're 18 With A Bullet
Got my finger on a trigger, I'm not afraid to pull it
If it gets out of hand I know some mafiosos
Quick to pull out cuetes on some stupid ass baboso
Sitting there wondering what's happened, que pasa
Yeah, this is for the Raza

There they go over there!
Aw man, shit!
I gotta get up off my ass and go chase these cholo muthafuckas
I hate those fuckin' Mexicans

[Verse 1: Kid Frost]
I'm always gettin' caca from the blaca
The b.g. hooter always pull me over
Take me out the rafla, sit me on the curb 
...and then they look me over
They ask about my beeper, I'm not a dope dealer
This is the Cherokee 4 wheeler
If I was sellin' drugs
To all of the street thugs
Yo, I don't mean to brag
But I'd be drivin' in a Jag
I wouldn't be hittin' the Eastside lowridin'
I'd be in Hollywood or Venice Beach high-profilin'
And all that shit
And I happen to play along with your stupid little skip
But I'll just kick it
Yo, go ahead and write your ticket
But hey yo, Mr. Officer, you know where you can stick it
I say this to myself, I let him do his thing
Or he might beat me down just like he beat down Rodney King
I got pulled over

[Police]	
Hey, don't that truck look familiar?
Yeah, that Cherokee over there?
I think that belongs to that fat fuck ah
...That La Raza muthafucka
Let's go fuck with him
		
Hey buddy, hey!
Alright, you fuckin...
Get your fuckin' fat ass out the car!

[Verse 2: MC Eiht]
It's 12 o'clock, late at night, I grab my keys
Kid Frost put me up with a skeez
So I roll a blunt to go
On that late night hype, who gives a fuck about five-o?
I'm knowin that they're schemin, but fuck it
Cause they cop car's a goddamn bucket
Geah, I ain't sweatin shit, check the Eiht
So they run a make on my goddamn plates
So I hit the next corner real slow
Low, here it go
The same old routine because of my car, black
Mistaken identity for slingin that dope sack
And just because Compton's my playground
They want a nigga like E to stay way down
But I done had enough with harrassin
Like I said, one time still gafflin
I know they up to no damn good
Jackin a nigga, cause I'm seen in the hood
But I best switch from a Benz to a Nova
To prevent them from pullin me over

[Police]	
Pull your ass over and get on the sidewalk, lock hands and feet
You know the routine, nigga
Yeah, nigga, you rollin down Alondra like you own this muthafucka
Where the sack at, muthafucka, where the sack?

[Eiht]	
The sack? 
Nigga, ain't no sack
The only sack is my nutsac
You got the MC Eiht mixed up with these other clockers
Get off the dick, muthafucka

[Verse 3: ALT]
ALT, that's me, I'ma flex again
The hooter, they were dyin' to shoot another Mexican
So I learn: if I don't want to burn
Then I pass up my exit, cause I'm afraid to turn
And if I don't, then that pig'll be vicious
Cause every hispanic at night is suspicious
I'm thinkin' to my mind that I can hardly bare it
I heard 'Fuck the Police', but they forgot about the sheriffs
And if I said it, then I might get beat down
And I ain't goin' out by a clown in a brown gown
They ain't passin', no time for dashin'
Looked in my mirror, I seen red lights flashin'
He had his hand on his gun on his hip
And when he walked up, yo, that dumb fuck tripped
He was pissed, he said that I gave him some lip
So he busted me, now I'm in custody
He called my mother and he said he'd knock me silly, but
Then I felt the crack of his muthafuckin billyclub
Another night with a nurse looking over my shoulder
Just because I got pulled over

[Police]	
Hey, Honcho
Get your taco-eatin' ass out of the car
What's your fuckin' name?

[ALT]	
I'm ALT, but what the fuck did I do?

Down for any situation that would come up
Zero tolerance which means I put up with nada

With bare hands I grab you around your throat and choke ya
Don't mess with my crazy life, mi vida loca
My crazy life
At the age of twelve I started packing a knife 
Back then, gangbanging was all but fun
At the age of fourteen I started packing a gun
It was a .32 Berretta
And there was no way in hell that I would ever let a 
Dumb punk sissy start talking smack
Or work with a smirk and peel this cap
Quicker than your ass could peel an orange

Time is when a man is trying to make time with your woman,

Yo Frost, kick it to these people for real you know what I'm saying?

[verse 1 - Frost]
Time, sifts through the hourglass, through night and day
and I watch as the games people play
It's like do unto others than split
and if you can't back up what you say then you ain't shit (yeah)
I've seen the manifestations of the street
So I can manifest what I've seen on a drum beat
like just last night (yo what happened)
I watched these two vatos get in a crazy fight
one of them was quick to pull a knife
he stabbed him in the heart and now he's doing life
in prison at the age of 21 (yeah)
living on death row cause he couldn't let go
caught in the web of violence (damn)

It feel like the same old story, everywhere that I go
And I don't really wanna do it all again tomorrow
So I'm trying to find something brand new
I'm sorry if you see me and I'm acting brand new
It feel like the same old bitches, same old haters
See me in the club, wanna come sit at my table
I'm trying to find something brand new
I'm sorry if you see me and I'm acting brand new

No handouts for no niggas
No handouts for no bitches
Killed the underground with my lifestyle
I'll let y'all fucks be the witness
But I'm losing my mind
On the block like 9 and a 9
Well until it got pined
You ain't know that it's something about time?
We didn't care about that
Remember the time I said I rapped?
Then the niggas came after
Even the hoes was full of laughter
Flew back to the booth, went harder
Now node your heads to the product
Suck a nigga dick like he hotter
Slinky on the booty like your father

Beard look like Osama
Don't talk to me less about commas
Real shit, Go time get a meal tip
Save your compliments for the comments
Getting money is my assignment
Will still be in the set

Damn, these niggas hating, I can't understand
I'm your favourite's favourite, you the fan of a fan

Shorty said she coming, she bringing a friend
They ain't smoking with me, though, cause they didn't put in
Bitch, I be touring with Tunechi and Mack
Saluting Stunna on the way to the stage and way back
How many niggas you know chill on the block with they fam and
Tell you if you need something handled, go and holla at Nick Cannon
Still spitting like I'm trying to get the deal
Don't fly private all the time, but I fly private with Shaquille

[Chorus]

Same old haters, niggas just don't give a fuck
Tired of that old shit, swag is on some Bentley truck
Tired of these zeroes, ain't nobody near, though
Cause ain't nobody ready, throw the paper like confetti
Man, I get jobs, a hundred stack
Ya'll miss Jobs, like Wozniak
I make y'all insomniac?
No more sleeping, nigga
What you thinking, nigga?
I got your girl and need that E like we the Weeknd, nigga
People figure, cause I don't like it unless it's brand new
Everything is old news, even all your club clothes
Look like shit I wear when I need something from the Whole Foods

Anyway man I swear that they f***in' lost
Lost, in the sauce
They f***in' lost, lost in the sauce
They f***in' lost, lost
And I been tryna play it off
But somebody needs to tell 'em who they really are

And tell 'em what I'm really bout
From the bottom nobody there to dig me out
All these gold diggin' hoes on a n**** now
Tell her take it to the floor baby sit it down
Way before the rap n****
I would barely wave to these whack n****s
But now I see 'em all with they hands out
Like a diver, I let 'em all drown
I'm yellin' out
Reportin' live somewhere on a cloud
World wide but these n****s know I'm west bound
Everybody takin' shots lemme get a round
Talkin' s*** I'll plunge a muhf***a
At the top come bungee with a muhf***a
Up all night f*** who the rest is
Bet your girlfriend know who the best is

Man I hear these n****s talk

They come and try to tell me that it's hype now
Hollywood they ain't ready for my lifestyle
Money talk I don't care how it might sound
Put your ears to the ground hear me comin' down, like a stampede
Live the fast life, of a celebrity
These n****s ain't won s*** why they celebratin'
On a whole nother level on the elevator
Got 'em lookin' to the sky see me high up
Finally everything I desired
Is in my hands, seen so many n****s lose it
Over this bulls***
No aim shootin' for the stars with a full clip
Now they tryna get they hands in my pot
Lost in the sauce meatball problems
Swear I can't take no more of the nonsense
Tell 'em that I'm ready for the consequence, b****

Kid Ink,"Now you walking around like you hot to death
Really four below, it don’t make no sense
Tried to tell you before not to lose yourself
Don’t you worry I’ll be here when its no one left
Tell you what it is, everybody ain’t a friend
Watch them change like a pen, I’ll be here when its no one left
Put your mind in the game, call up on what they say
You forgot about the plan
Tried to tell you not to lose yourself

Uh, sitting back, talking to myself
Been a long way around like Buddha’s belt
Remember when ,these lames wouldn’t fuck with me
Track star, now they all tryin’ to run with me
Friend or foe, you never know
It’s a blind game, be in the way you going
Get your mind right, and leave the left overs
Got the weight of an entire team on my shoulders
So I showed them I’m everything the world may
Tryin’ to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Please
Don’t you get it, twist it like a whirlwind
I will never change, never change ’till the fucking end
TruTV, all these niggas so pretend in your face
Complimenting when they really know they spend every day
Talking shit yeah it smells like a mouthful
Hotter that I get, these niggas colder than the South Pole

Now you walking around like you hot to death
Really four below, it don’t make no sense
Tried to tell you before not to lose yourself
Don’t you worry I’ll be here when its no one left

Watch them change like a pen, I’ll be here when its no one left
Put your mind in the game, call up on what they say
You forgot about the plan
Tried to tell you not to lose yourself

What’s happenin’? Can you tell me what happened
Is it fame over passion, seem a little distracted
In a couple situations you ain’t used to
Now look around pay attention it ain’t no discounts
These niggas is selling souls for their name on a cloud
Don’t you worry about me, bitch I came for the doubt
I’m so concrete
Two feet to the ground
About to fuck shit up
But I came into town
Think you need to slow it down
Tryin’ to run shit
Lost in the sauce, get a compass
High off life, barely even conscious
Livin’ in a dream, you forgot what it means to
Not have a thing from a block full of fiends
These streets are a monster
Happy Halloween
Now I’m knocking at your door
With a mask on
Feeling like this life
Isn’t everything you asked for

Now you walking around like you hot to death
Really four below, it don’t make no sense

I go, til, the bottle's, hollow
Smokin' on diablo, smellin' like patron and
Marc jacob's cologne, up & away new generation
Apollo shit, so ready to roll, and rockout

On Highland and Sunset, doin' 85 on the top deck
See, step by step we're walking on stars

Riding through the sun, riding through the sunset
Now, stop tripping, just give me a minute
And wait until the sun, wait until the sun goes down

Won't judge you, go on, be free
So pour what you want
Go head, roll what you want
Fuck what they say, somebody
Walkin' 'round here like they're somebody
Don't know what kind of day I had
With all this weight, couldn't hold my bag
Don't hold me back from my habits
Live a fast life for the magic
I'm just lookin' 'round for the baddest
Hollywood face with an ass from Dallas
Big-ass crib, nigga livin' in a palace

Hit her with a glass of sparkling wine
Hit her on the ass, she might not mind
Actin' like a 10, look more like a 9, but
Don't be stuck up
Really, how could you not see us
Doing it big, it's obvious
You ain't gotta say much, 'cause
I know you're sick and tired, sick and tired of all that bullshit
Then don't be afraid, take a shot and bite the bullet
That's one in the hole
Can't get enough, need one or two more
Tell 'em catch up, they're running to slow
Out the gutter, I learned to bowl
And finally it's movie time to show them I play the role

Look into my eyes you can see the pain
Painted a perfect picture where I came from
Some nights when I thought I wouldn’t see the sun
Son raised, though daddy wasn’t home, word
Hard tryna hold it down like a short skirt
Skurr off from these niggas tryna hold me back
I will not lose, Hov told me that
Dreaming bout a moment that’ll change my life
I don’t never wanna wake up, turn off the lights

Too cool for school, I’m too rude for Jude
There’s no rules in the life we choose
I gotta ride for something, gotta die for something
Say you only live once, well I keep it 100

Dear Kells I heard yo story and felt it man
Your voice inspires, I feel like I can do anything
By the way, I sent you something from my brother
Open it up, a razor felt, it was a cutter, damn!
What if you were me, in 2003?

See everybody around us, we built this from the ground up, damn
I know you can feel the movement, moving
Top speed, no side bitch, losing's no option
Said I know you can feel the movement

Duckin' the rules, high, stuck in the move
Don't look confused, everything coming in 2's
From 3 to 6 in the morning
What is you doin'? Really don't care if you don't
Like what I'm on, to hell wit all yo complaints
I'm tryna stay humble and motivate
But let's celebrate, pour me a drink
Everything earned never concerned long as we grind
How do you skate?
All of these tats, all of this gold, stereotypes I'm tryna escape
I can see just why you relatin'
But in my mind nobody competin'
Leavin' behind the rearview chasin'
Ridin' in my own lane just racin'
Boy catch up, it ain't no pressure under pressure
Make sure to get my respect, waitress
Make sure everything is my just wants
These haters in the building keep grillin'
But ain't nobody gon do shit
We in this here just deeper than usual

I know you can feel the movement, moving
I know you can feel the movement, moving
We ain't tryna hurt nobody
We ain't tryna hurt nobody

I know you can feel the movement, moving
See everybody around us, we built this from the ground up, damn
I know you can feel the movement, moving
Top speed, no side bitch, losing's no option
Said I know you can feel the movement

Said I know you can feel the movement
Pull up, truck big as a mover, ain't nowhere to park
Backyard big as an amusement park
Come through lookin' like the millionaire march
My bad, I just had to brag one time
Hit em in the head with a brand new style
Closet full but there ain't no ties
Mouth full of gold, got a brand new smile
It ain't nothing new that these groupies been choosin'
But we movin', better hold on, don't lose it

I know you can feel the movement, moving
See everybody around us, we built this from the ground up, damn
I know you can feel the movement, moving

Is you with all the burglarizing and the violence?
If Jimmy got caught up, but you right there with him
So the police askin' you questions, is you gone keep quiet?
Is you loyal, is you real, is you fake?
When I can't tell that's the type of way that I hate
You got that fake friend, syndrome
There's no cure so your symptoms is gon' show
You know the code, stick around, hold it down, never fold
Like it's a crease up in your Dicky Browns
Hold up, each one teach one
Motivate each one to be somethin'
Cause I ain't just another statistic
I do this and that if you wanna get specific
I'm just tryna make bread come quicker
For me and my day one hitters

Kid Koala,"When he went away for the last time
It wasn't so easy, words were hard to find
And the cows in the barn knew it was milking time
Must of been real hard to leave everything behind,
Over there a moonless night shivering a secret fright
It wasn't so easy.
And how many missions more, where to and what for?
Ask the government, tell it to the cows in the barn

Then there was the moon, what did the moon see?
Saw the blade of grass in one boy's eye
And pain that'll make you glad you're dying

Hands that dribbled the basketball
Voice that sang out of tune
Love that ended too soon
A nose that bled for better reasons.

When he went away for the last time
It wasn't so easy, words were hard to find
And the cows in the barn knew it was milking time
It was milking time but he was so far away,
So far away that even prayers could not reach
So he died there.

When he came back for the last time
It wasn't so easy, words were hard to find
And we buried him before it was milking time

But I shall want to know why.",An Elegy,2005

Pulling nails out of my head
Lucy's on my shoulder
Talking like she owns the dead

so you wanna be my soldier
And to ride your own shooting star
I'll see you on your back in twelve boy
And I'll fly you where the moon is dark

in three you get your snow white sandbox
Chariot and golden fleece
Give 'em anything thatíll make 'em scream
To a funky pumping beat

in six you're up to sugar daddy
The mansion full of beautiful girls
In nine you're the new messiah
Playing Messaline on fire

in twelve it's not a pretty sight
And she's nowhere to be seen
I could come around a full moon later
But I was never much of a waiter

so I'm off to dedicate my life
To the death of rock ën roll

And I just keep my soul

Your revolution will not happen between these thighs
Your revolution will not happen between these thighs

Not happen between these thighs

The real revolution ain't about booty size
The Versaces you buys, or the Lexus you drives
And though we've lost Biggie Smalls
Baby your notorious revolution
Will never allow you to lace no lyrical douche, in my bush

Your revolution will not be killing me softly, with Fugees
Your revolution ain't gonna knock me up without no ring
And produce little future emcees
Because that revolution will not happen between these thighs
Your revolution will not find me in the backseat of a jeep

With LL, hard as hell, you know doin it and doin it and doin it well
Doin it and doin it and doin it well, nah come on now
Your revolution will not be you smacking it up, flipping it, or rubbing it down
Nor will it take you downtown or humpin around
Because that revolution will not happen between these thighs

Your revolution will not have me singing, ain't no nigga like the one I got
And your revolution will not be sending me for no drip, drip VD shot
And your revolution will not involve me, feelin your nature rise
Or helping you fantasize
Because that revolution will not happen between these thighs

No no, not between these thighs
Oh, my Jamican brother, your revolution will not make you feel bombastic
And really fantastic
And have you groping in the dark for that rubber wrapped in plastic
You will not be touching your lips to my triple dip of french vanilla, 

Butter pecan, chocolate delux
Or having Akinyele's dream, m-hmm a 6-foot blowjob machine m-hmm
You want to subjugate your queen? uh-huh
Think I'm a put it in my mouth, just cuz you made a few bucks?
Please brother please

Your revolution will not be me tossing my weave
And making me believe I'm some caviar-eating ghetto mafia clown
Or me giving up my behind, just so I can get signed
And maybe having somebody else write my rhymes
I'm Sarah Jones, not Foxy Brown

You know I'm Sarah Jones, not Foxy Brown
Your revolution makes me wonder, where could we go
If we could drop the empty pursuit of props and ego
We'd revolt back to our Roots, use a little Common Sense
On a quest to make love De La Soul, no pretense

But your revolution will not be you flexing your little sex and status
To express what you feel
Your revolution will not happen between these thighs
Will not happen between these thighs
Will not be you shaking and me *yawn* faking

Between these thighs
Because the real revolution, that's right I said the real revolution
You know I'm talking about the revolution

Kid Ory,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

I'll make life for you, one grand sweet song

I try not to slide, but walk a straight line
Though it's hard when the climb gets steep
The one who finds is the one who seeks

So I sought and fought
And a lot I got taught
And although I left those who stole got caught
Many shows I rocked

Many suckers I laughed at
And those who snapped back usually got slapped
The cat if I was strap
'Cause I was a son of a gun

Livin' life on the run
Now I pleaded 18 and outdone by none

When many thought I was just gettin jerked

Used, abused, but I paid my dues
And now no one out there could fill my shoes
And my pants and do this dance
This shit didn't happen by chance

It went slow not quick, but now I'm your pick
Ain't that a trip when I started from zip
And now up and up and up I won't stop

Ascending up and up I keep boosting

Name and they claim me, yo, that they're winnin'
A lotta just came in, sound the same in
Thinkin' they swift and can get with these young men
But I keep the crowd swingin' like Tarzan

'Cause I'm a wise man here to teach and speak
And if you step out of line your up shits creek
So come with it, Kid Rock's gonna get it
His style ain't dope, its a throat, and I slit it

I'm raw like cowhide, smooth like a plane ride
No half steppin', I always take a full stride
Who came played and they say I'm concrete made
I used to come correct in the projects

Now as I said my prayers through the years I shed a few tears
'Cause it's unjust when I see my peers get shot
And dropped and forgot, now that's hot
Too many can't score as victims of a drug war

Cocaines ran and weapons are shipped out
The press finds out, then the public is tripped out
New tax the acts and half the drug industry
Uncle Sam is my man, are you kiddin me

Me in the Whitehouse, now that's fucked up
For one to get over, one must get stuck up
One will roll up, another will smoke up
Two more thrown in jail, who picks the toll up

Tell her to beware if she's gonna stand there
Eyes bugged out and hands in the air
'Cause there comes an onlooker, lookin for a hooker
And act like the doors overlooked her and took her

For a place to hide and when he got his ride
He let the nice slide and the girl, she died
Her family cried over this homicide
And why they pondered, why she wandered

Left her own spot, her home, her mom and pop
All to smoke a little cooked up rock
So on and so strong, she couldn't get along
Knowledge is power, and there's a point to this song

Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin'
Come together
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin'
Come together

From the outskirts with a mind like Albert Einstein
Maybe I'm ahead of my time
Imaginate, create, spectate, elevate from the states
Surrounded by the Great Lakes

I was once out cold at 15 years old
Rolled and sold, you, me, and Bo
Sittin' in Jackson infested with rats
With a silver gat tucked deep in my slacks

I was a young bad mother in my own eyes
But now I realize it wasn't too wise
So now I teach, I'll reach to each
And every single individual

Kid Rock,"Never thought about the other side, oh no
It was always lets go try to pull some hoes
And I pulled 'em like a tow-truck
Since I was a young buck

Guaranteed the hoes always got fucked
With a one-two and all that good shit
I never flipped or tripped or got pussy whipped
'Cause I'm K-K-K-K Kid Rock motherfucker

You want to piece of me
You're just another sucker
But oh well you don't bother me none
'Cause me and your girl have lots of fun

You know the one that looks like a model
Sucks on my nuts like a baby on a milk bottle
Not cause I make her, I wouldn't make her
But cause I mack her right, she loves me all night

With a one-two and all that good shit
With a one-two I take another sip
With a one-two and I'll rock this party
With a one-two ya better ask somebody

Get down girl and read my mind
And you'll see that it's focused on your behind
You gotta lotta class and don't mind me askin
But can I go up in your fat ass

And just pump, pump, pump
What's next? check your money
It's scum and its time to jet
You bet she'll be into it more

On the bed the steps and the kitchen floor
You like the way the K-I-
Did it like I said I
Would, could, should I do it good

In your neighborhood
On your fuckin block
'Cause I'm the coooool the Kid Rock
Kid Rock, Kid Kid Rock, Kid Kid Rock, Kid Rock, Kid Rock
Make it nasty

Hoes talk the same shit
Ya dress like a slob
But bitches still give a good blow-job
Up come my drawers and it's goodbye

The Kid Rock's just got to fly Cause it's 1-9-9-0
Time to fuck hoes
But before ya goin put Jimmy in a lambskin
And we could bump all night you bet

So get set to jet and go get wet
Come on outta your girdle and slacks
And I'll shine that booty like turtle wax

With a one-two and all that good shit
With a one-two I take another sip
With a one-two and I'll rock this party
With a one-two ya better ask somebody

Kid Rock,"Ahh... 
I`m here and it`s clear I`m gonna flow so yo black
Just get on up or yo get the bozak 
'Cause it ain`t Kojak or Dr. Suess

It`s the kid mother fucker and I`m gonna get loose 
'Cause I got the juice to spruce and get nice and
So enticing strong like a bison 
Ruff like brandy and no one knows

That I got more riffs than Randy Rhoads 
Smash, slash and when I trash I bash
I get ill I chill but you don`t know the half 
I trip I rip and though I think I`m slick

I`m nothin but a funky country hick 
But I still get down with a sound that pumps
And you can hear me from the trucks and the trunks that bump 
Never been questioned by the F.B.I

Although I`ve tried every method just to get high 
L.S.D. is what I`m trippin on
And O.E. bitch is what I`m sippin on 
A big fat booty`s what I`m grippin on

But for now I`m gonna rock and keep rippin on 
Down to the mother fuckin A.M.
As I co bump and jump and keep the crowd in mayhem 
No brain no pain...Now c`mon why'all and tell me what`s my name

3 sheets 2 the wind is the state I`m in
Half off the wagon with my feet draggin' 
Taggin' hoes gettin' lots of trim
Gettin' jocks and props for all the spots I rock 

I`m true I`m blue like Captain Kangaroo
And for the few who knew yo I`m a bang for you 
Because the Kid Rock ain`t no bitch yo
And I ain't no radio want to get rich ho 

So count my props you can`t get with me and fuck all you cops you ain`t shit to me 
But hoes with guns playin hard for fun
So stay off my dick becuz I ain`t the one 
And for anyone tryin to bust me up

You better chill with that tryin to fuck me up 
And if you`re talkin shit I`m gonna shut ya up
And all ya wack D.J.`s I`m gonna cut ya up 
'Cause I don`t give a fuck about no one

And when I wax I tax and that`s just how it goes son 
Yo ain`t no sucker
'Cause I`m the kid..""rock mother fucker"" 
Straight from Mo-town and I won`t slow down

I cease the cheese M.C,`s I moe down 
And I show no shame 'cause I`m down for mine
Now tell me what`s my name 
It ain`t Eric Clapton and this ain`t slowhand

I`m the kid ya dig and I`m a rock the whole land 
'Cause no man can make a track this grand
And if you know what I know than just...",3 Sheets to the Wind,1993
Kid Rock,"Back from the dead second L.P. here we go
Comin at ya from the R.O.M.E.O. 
Pistol packed with a crew'o fly slimmys
Hat turned back in some Airwalk jimmys 

Never slackin hoes I be mackin
Not wacked I don't try to act black when 
I came up I came at ya from the outskirts
Bag of weed in the pocket of my sweatshirt 

Bone 2 the bone 2 the bad 2 the bad 2 the bone
Hit bound from the Mo-town allen
Fuck a 40 I drink it by the gallon 
I started out in Mount Clemens as a D.J.

Park parties gettin drunk on Sunday 
Tweeked in the heat 2 a beat I'd rock 2 the -and rip shit up 
An now I've toured this nation
Pimp of the nation

Pullin hoes 
Rock the set in each city then step
Me, Blackman and Funk Daddy Def Stef 
Bitches, they think I'm sexist

But all I want baby is your grits for breakfast 
Eggs, bacon, home cooked fries
And gimme a plate of that pussy on the side 
Triple x on the set showin no class

Just a foul mouthed little fuckin smart ass 
No fool I went 2 high school dumb ass 
Smoked dope and I flunked every class 
Slash and I smash 'cause I thrash when I bash

Invite me to a party and your house'll get trashed 
An outcast sick of being harassed so I dashed
Moved out of the crib 'cause I hated cuttin grass 
Now I reside on the eastside lovin it

Cold 40 dog in a brown bag chuggin it 
Flex, sex, run of the next
Flippin and trippin and rippin and shakin the suckers who wanted 2 
Front an get around 2 the

2 get up or get down 2 the rhyme
I'm shakin and takin and breakin I rip the mic like 
Every time fuck I don't eat no manwich
Kickin back coolin with a cold grits sandwich 

Somebody said I'm the best in the Mo-town
But this town ain't shit but a ghost town 
Who ever said it they lied they fessed
Bitch I'm the best in the mother fuckin midwest 

Want to be heard when I rap so I yell it
Sport a Tigers cap like my man Tom Selleck 
One bad bitch I smoke hash from a stick
Got more cash than fuckin White Boy Rick 

My first LP wasn't pushed for shit
So Jive Records yo, go and suck a fat dick 
'cause I'm rippin like a chainsaw
Yes I'm that raw laughin' at ya suckers like Hee Haw 

Roll it up, take a hit and then pass it
That's how we do it when we roll down Gratiot 
In my Grand Marquis I pimp to the beat
Two in the front and two hoes in the back seat",Back from the Dead,1993
Kid Rock,"A bottle of jack's got my manager grinnin'
Yeah that's me that keeps the turntables spinniN'
I'm countin cards and I keep on winnin'
I know God hates me 'cause I'm always sinnin'

You don't know me blow me ho you want to get hot
You'll get your ass blown out fuckin with the Kid Rock 
Eatin up ya suckers just the same way a beast could
Tearin through your town like mother fuckin Clint Eastwood 

'cause I be fakin the rhymes that keep ya shakin'
Makin a lotta money but don't let me be mistaken
I never thought about climbin up the pop chart
And I don't give a fuck you can't buy my tape in K-Mart 

Give me a choice between soundin like an ass wipe
Or sittin in an alley smokin crack from a glass pipe 
I'd be as skinny as a junkie with the AIDS plague
But still I'd look better than a puppet tryin to get paid 

Now check the rhyme as I climb and I co get rude
And send ya runnin' playin' pussy like Shaggy and Scoob 
'cause I'm the wrong dude to fuck with my mouth is mental
And I'm a tear shit up like they did in South Central 

Son of a bitch I'm the son of a bitch
Nobody ever loved you so you're the son of a dick 
I'm a product of a young girl top in her class
You're a product of a hooker who was sellin that ass 

And your styles in the past it's old and dusty
So from now on I'm callin you M.C. Crusty 
'cause to face me you must be blitzed or blasted
So now I'm gonna drop ya like a hit of acid 

And when I rip ya people they might stare
'cause I got more rhymes than Donahue's got white hair

And tell your mom I want to fuck and I'll pick her up at 10",Blow Me,1993
Kid Rock,"Back in the mother fuckin saddle
My six shooter strapped and I'm lookin for a battle 
Out on the plains I'm just a loner
My saddle horn rubs right and yo it's givin me a boner 

I got thoughts of Annie Oakley
But that buck toothed tramp in that last town she broke me 
And we didn't even fuck
I gave my last gold tooth 'n gold nugget to get my dick sucked 

3 days out on the frontier
And I'd kill for a cheap whore and a barrel of cold beer 
I need a slut for a service
I take a peak at the shiip and they all run away nervous 

Man I gotta get my rocks off
'cause my Wranglers don't fit right unless my cock's soft 
Long nights by the fire me a Trigger.....go figure 

[Chorus]
I'm a desperate rado
Didn't take any practice
A desperate rado

Got a cock like a cactus 
Now I drift through the desert like a wild coyote
Horny as a toad trippin off peyote 
Holdin uptrains and gettin goods by the sack

I'm known through out the west as the pie eyed mack 
And to the law I'm no stranger
I'm wanted dead or alive 'cause I shot the Lone Ranger 
And then Tonto tried to get down

So I boned his bitch slit he's throat and then I skipped town 
That's the way I run my show
Paint towns red
Fuck hoes and then I lay low 

I know you think I'm archaic
But my dick's like a sword
I see pussy and want to slay it 
Out on the plains it gets linely

Sometimes I feel homely
New faces
New towns no one knows me 
Guns cocked in my holster

You see my face in each town nailed to a pole on a poster 
I'm always lookin for the quick buck
Then always blowin my cash on a bitch with a big butt 
Some say my head's hollow

Fuck em... I'm just a 

[Chorus 2]
Desperate rado
Trottin through the bad lands
A desperate rado
Tokin down with all the cowhands 
A desperate rado
Didn't take much practice
A desperate rado

Got a cock like a cactus 
Now I fuck whores by the scores up ten fold on any fellow
In any town I can be found at the local bordello 
Never yellow never chicken listen for my spurs draggin, 

And when I'm kickin dust you better circle up the wagons 
So when I rip through your town don't be gawkin
Just tip your hat and Tex keep walkin 
'Cause I'm a gun slingin top hand

Fuck with me and you'll go out like Custer at his last stand 
I'm a low down buckaroo
If you leave me alone with your mother then I'll fuck her too 
'Cause I'm a sidewinding nomad

And morals in upbringing is something that I never had 
Known as the ruff ridin Texan
A bad buck from the day of my inception. 
And I was raised in the poor house

My mother kicked me out so she could start a whore house 
Now since the day I left the corral
I've been on a quest for the plant that's called mescal 
'Cause pale rider once pulled me aside
And told me that high was the best way to ride... 

[Chorus 3]
Now I'm a desperate rado
Always lookin for a fight
A desperate rado
Puffin on a peace pipe 
I'm a desperate rado
On the run from the law
A desperate rado baddest one you ever saw",Desperate-Rado,1993
Kid Rock,"I had a realization of God, i saw God
And umm, it's not a face or a figure or anything
It was a presence, umm the woods
(all natural) God is all natural
The sun, the universe, everything
You, me were part of God, were part of God
It was an incredible feeling
And to use acid is religious for me",Fred,1993
Kid Rock,"I'm on the brink I wonder what you bitches think
Like Madonna walkin round like you ship doesn't stink 
No class jack ass bitches actin like a burro
Dressed in black head to toe thinkin you're so fuckin euro 

Tryin to act Manhattan when you're from some little village
In a Public Enemy shirt and it's all for your image 
'Cause any other rap you think it's crap fuckin trash
Bitch talk your shit just never let me get that ass

'Cause... 

[Chorus]
I'll fuck you blind bitch
I'll fuck you blind bitch
I'll fuck you blind till you just can't see no more 

Back in school I knew this chick her name was Sara Bolerdies
And she thought she was the shit becuz she dated older guys 
Dumb bitch fuckin whore always wanted to get laid
But never gave the pussy up to anybody in her grade 

Played me like a sucker
Like a bitch like a punk
That little pussy lickin finger fuckin ho ass cunt 
Never once did she speak to anybody in her class

So one day I told her never let me get that ass
'Cause... 

[Chorus]

Gettin' drunk smokin' buddha, 
Gettin' laid and gettin' played like fuckin' Amy Papuda 
Better chill with that before you kill the cat
Before you spend your fuckin' life lying on your back 

You ain't gotta let me fuck you to be liked
Get a grip, shit I'll like you just the same if you suck a good dick 
And yo I'm not speakin' to all you girls at my shows
I'm speakin' directly to all you fuckin' bitches and hoes
Huh

'Cause I love women ones who chill drink and laugh
But if your fake ho don't ever cross my mother fuckin' path",Fuck U Blind,1993
Kid Rock,"My ideas like highs
They come and they go
It seems I've forgotten what I need to know 
I feel I'm wasting time at night when I sleep

Someone so shallow that's in so deep 
So I patch the holes that yet haven't appeared
Completely blinded but things are so clear 
I know just what to do but why the fuck should I bother

I'm content sitting at the right hand of our father 
Fuckin' A is all I got to say
Give me peace of mind and I'll be on my way 
I was born into this world and I don't know why
So all I'm doing's passing time before I die",In So Deep,1993
Kid Rock,"Kid rock that's right you know I'm back ho
From the dead where I had to lay low
Seems strange but I ain't changed nothing
Pot smokin' beer drinkin' motherfucker that's me

In the flesh and I guess I'm the best
In the motherfuckin midwest 'cause there's no contest
For the pimp, I'm the pimp of the nation
So fuck college and a good education

All we need to learn is how to hold hands
Then we could live in peace in my homeland
God damn the way my pain swells
I spend all my time killin' brain cells

The light shed on me was a dim gleam
So I live life in a bottle of Jim Beam
Droppin' dots or sniffin' that blow black,
I go to sleep at night watchin' Kojak

Fuck hoes 'cause I'm no big fag
Roll with Zig Zags like to read skin mags
When I shoot I never miss
And if I played the bass I'd probably pluck it like this...

People want to know what I'm thinkin' but I don't care
So I keep my thoughts in a bottle of Cuervo
Just a wild young buck
Got banned from the shelter but I really don't give a fuck

'cause I still be clownin' suckers be frownin'
Forties of Busch I be poundin'
I ain't dead in the head like Manson
I'm more laid back than motherfuckin' Ted Danson

Hanson brother style when I'm rumblin'
Couple of shots of Don Q and I be stumblin'
Fumblin' footballs hangin' in the pool halls
Out late night with my crew stealin' you-hauls

I'm not into havin' clean fun
I step into the party strapped with a machine gun
But I'm no gangster like Gotti
""I'm just an M.C. to put the boogie in the party""

Back in black plus a new track
And I won't quit till your ears blow from feedback
When I shoot I never miss
And if I played the guitar I'd probably strum it like this...

So give it up bitch 'cause I'm the kid rock
And today I know you don't want to get shot
You look gay you're too cliche
So fuck all y'all hoes and yo Chuck pass the jay

Sellin' me out like bitches to make a quick buck
But motherfuckers like y'all just have no luck
Your little plan was a flop
Tryin' to get em on by sellin' out the Kid Rock

A part of me was with you but yo he died,
And I'm glad you stepped off 'cause I ain't givin' no free rides
You little bald headed peon
And fuck it motherfucker if you want it lets get the beef on

'cause I'm sure I'm sure ya
Are gonna try to come back around but I'll ignore ya
It only takes one shot to floor ya
'cause I'm Kid Rock bitch and I'm real mutha for ya

Better jet so 'cause I won't let no hoes from the metro
Take mine ""what up doe""
Come look son I'm number one...
""'cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done""

In the twilight zone with Rod Serling
I ain't goin' bald so fuck Sy Sperling
When I shoot I never miss
And if I played the harmonica I'd probably blow it like this...",Killin' Brain Cells,1993

How could you look through my face and not see your own eyes 

Do as I say and not as I do
But I can't 'cause when I look in the mirror I see you
And oh the pain how it hurts
It was always your home and your business that came first 

You said a man is as good as his word

Look at you then look at me...

And I know at times I was not always there for you 
No we never spent much time just talkin' or havin' a good time
But understand growin' up son I never had a dime 

So I worked my ass off and I put myself through college
And everything I have to this day you know I built it all 
Oh I wish I could go back and change the years that's lost between us
I wish I could take back some of the things I said to you 

Son I said I'm sorry but still you resent me so
Son I said I'm sorry and why do you resent me so

I always loved you I always cared for you
Just never wanted you to go through what I've been through 
I tried to raise my fuckin' family just the best I know
And now I'm hated like the devil and for why I don't know

It's the outlasting shotgun-blasting

And I turn more tricks than Tony Hawk 
Walk with a limp 'cause I pimp like a pro

I'm like a hound dog chasin a chipmunk 
I move quick like a cheetah

Jumpin 'round like a homo on a pogo stick 
Yo rock, What's up stop being a jerk
And just ""Give 'em an example of how a D.J. works""

'cause it's blackjack and I got two aces
Been many places seen many faces 
And everywhere I go people want to jive
So I keep my fingers on my .45 

So don't cross my dusty path
Or I'll put my foot up in crusty ass 
Don't front ho pass the jay
Then hear me M.C. and watch me D.J.

Kid Rock,"'cause growin up I was never the logical one,
Packed my shit and left home like the prodigal son
With a bottle of jack and my shotgun strapped,
I went looking for fame and yo I've never been back

Filled with spite staying high as a kite,
I was dealin and stealin everything in sight
Pool hustling trying to make that green,
I've been ramblin and gamblin since the age of 13

Working like a bitch like a god damn tank,
Some disagree because my rents had bank
But all that's gold non't always glitter,
So I'll take another puff from my one hitter

I'm a slave to the trade I'm paid to rhyme,
Blow all my cash on cheap women and wine
'Cause money, money, money ain't shit to me,
But I gotta make a lot just to be free

She feels me where I lay
I hope to God one day she'll see that my love is not that way
She holds me in the morning time and never lets me go

I hope that one she'll see and she come in to my show
Please God, please I'll pay any cost,
If you'd just stop the world cause I want to get off

There's too much hardship there's too much pain
There's too many motherfuckers tryin to get in my brain
I've been to your mountains I've been to your seaside,
And everywhere I went somebody's wanted a free ride

But parasites can't fade the Rock,
And any suckers that step in my way are getting shot
'Cause I hold key to my own success,
And suckers that step willll be put to rest, yes,

I hold the key to my own success,
And suckers that step will catch a bullet in their chest,
So pass the buddha,
The funky tie hooter,

And watch me rip because I'm such a slick shooter.
Not a generic dime a dozen m.c.,
Never was in a posse never wanted to be

Now I've been walkin the earth since the beginning of time,
And won't leave till I've received that 7th sign
All this talk their gonna drop the bomb,

But life keeps going on and on and on and on
The world's end don't worry me,
And I'm gonna get where I'm going just hurry me
'Cause I'm in no rush and I can't stand rushin,

Everything is slow motion like I'm trippin on tussin
Fussin with the girls they waste my time,
Thrashin and bashin going out of my mind
Crucified by the critics everyday,

'Cause I ain't really got that much to say
I'm a slave to the trade I'm paid to rhyme,
I don't wear a watch and I don't keep time
I live my life just like the skipper,

But only at night because I'm a day tripper
Twitchin-shakin,
And I kick more bass then John Paul Jones
Visions of red shoot through my head,
And I won't stop trippin till the day I'm dead

[Chorus]

Many nights she comes to me
She feels me where I lay

2 bums in an alley with a bottle of rum 
1 bum said look Jack I'm the shit

My mothers crazy I think she sniffs glue
She never liked me and I know that's true 
Kicked me out the crib becuz I got a tattoo
No one loves me and no one cares

And all I ever get is funny stares 
I can't help it if I'm nothin but a wino

I like bean burritos from Taco Bell

I like trippin on acid with Dick Vitale

I'm down with Bill Bands so Fuck Joe Glover
And while I'm at it mother fuck fat ass Sally Struthers 
You look fine girl kinda undercover

But I can't fuck ya 'cause you look like my mother 
I said dang digee dang di dang dang
It ain't Eric Estrada or cool and The Gang 
You know I hand in the Clem chillin on the strip

With all them mother fuckers who slang that shit 
You know I'm a pimp hold my dick like a holster
You sing it ""all the girls want a kid rock poster""

Kid Rock,"Here here we go from Japan to Romeo
My flow is slow and it's ya know my first time on radio 
Now some say I'm foul, some say I'm wild
And that all might be true

But it did not happen overnight
So let me tell my tale to you 
It started out when I was six just tellin' dirty jokes
My mother overheard and washed my mouth out with soap 

Now as I grew I always knew what it was for me to do
Never front just be blunt and always tell the truth 
Never fake, I never act like something that I'm not
Remember me I'm that foul mouthed kid that lived around your block 

You thought that I was crazy like a dog chasin it's tail
And by the time I turned of legal age I'd probably be in jail 
In school my teachers thought I was just a foul mouthed freak
Now their yearly salary is what I make in just one week 

So to thepeople who used to say you think you know it all
Maybe I do and maybe I don't but right now I'm standin tall... 
And you don't know me
It's funny how one kid can cause so much confusion

Parents should be happy I'm the dop their kids are using 
Now some people think this business is all fame and glory
But there's a flip side to that truth so let me kick my story 
It took me oh so long to reach the point I'm at

Every time I take one stip forward they push me two steps back 
I give an inch they take a mile some try to cramp my style
They try to diss they shoot they miss
I walk off with a smile 

But time will pass and I'll out last anyone who doubts me
And the booty naked truth is you don't know shit about me 
So when I'm in your town to nearst mic please kindly show me
So you can see what's really me and find out you don't know me 

'cause you don't know me 
Now you might want to party man so here's your party jam
Hey girly in that skirt I want you just like Uncle Sam 
Let's knock boots, let's knock boots right down to the nitty gritty

With every drind 'n every blink you seem to get more pretty 
So out the bar straight to my car now what's left to do
She was sayin I love you so I said yeah I love you to 
(Ha!) 

Next day I awoke I almost choked
Who's bringin me inside, 
My head was ringin' heard people singin' ""here comes the bride"" 
Thinkin just what was I drinkin as I looked around to see

The girl I met last night was at the alter waitin on me 
Next thing I know I'm face to face with holy matrimony
Looked at that bitch and I quick screamiN'
You don't know me...She didn't know me 

Girls around this country think I'm nasty think I'm sexist
But they bought my first L.P. 
You know-Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast 
Sayin ooh your this and oooh your that uh uh uh hold up cutie

What's your favorite song off that L.P.
""Ah, Wax that Booty"" 
A lesson taught, I know you thought my dirty raps were kinda funny
But close minded people thought I was only out to make money 

But check on back 'cause it's a fact obscenity is no new thing
Remember Chuck Berry and when he sang My Ding A Ling
But for me I feel what I see and I say just what I feel
And in this world everything I see you know is all too real 

Even though I don't look the same 'cause I cut off my flat top
I'll always say just what I feel 'cause that's the real Kid Rock... 
And you don't know me.",U Don't Know Me,1993
Kid Rock,"Cruising through town in my jacked up truck
Eyes open 'cause I'm scopin for a big butt slut
One that I can take straight back to my house
And have suck my dick and put my balls in her mouth

Now get, get with it looked across the street
Seen a slimmy in a skirt bopping to the beat
So I capped up my forty threw it under my seat
Rolled up on the freak and I started to speak

But before I could she go grabbed my dick
Licked her lips and started talking that porno shit
She said ""look here I know our kid rock""
Then whispered in my ear ""I want to swallow your cock""

Well blow me up then blow me down
'Cause I think I just found the biggest freak in town
And now I can't wait to get her back to my house
Set her on her knees and put my balls in her mouth

Balls in your mouth
Balls in your mouth
""you want my balls in your mouth?""

Back to my crib with no delay
Big grin on my grill and not much to say
Except hey yo bitch how's about
I drop my drawers and put my ballis in your mouth?

Then it was like straight out of a porn
She dropped to her knees and started blowing my horn
And after that without no doubt
She opened up wide and put my balls in her mouth

Next to cutie started rubbing my back
She put her finger right between my booty crack
So I grabbed her wrist quick and said hold up slut
""Ain't Nobody sticking nothing in my butt""

Now right then I knew I had a ho and a half
And all that I could do is sit back and laugh
Stare at the ceiling thinking about
This chick I just met's got my balls in her mouth

[Chorus]

After I busted my nuts I drover to the cut
She said ""I hope you don't think that I'm a big slut
And please don't tell anyone what we've been through""
Next day I told the whole fucking crew

Spread the news through the whole damn town
And to that chick it must have got back around
So I told the ho sorry and tried to make amends
But she tried to fuck me in front of my  friends

Running off at the lip talking all that shit
That I'm a bitch I'm a prick and I got a small dick
I just waited til she walked away to shout

Huh huh.... he's the mother fuckin cramper 
Now the crampers red, there's no one redder, 
He rides ya wrong like a really tight sweater 
He's sorta like a mouse a pest of a peer

Pokin' and strokin' he makes you want to belt him
Always wearin' out his mother fuckin' welcome 
And then sporty's never that cautious

I never was cool with James Dean, but I be hangin' tough
With my man Jim Beam
I swing low like a chimp
Back in eighty-six, then I was seein' a shrink

About New Orleans and those jumbo shrimp

As I sit in my chair and watch life go by
These thoughts I have, I can't mold the sense
Through the forest of my mind, they're all past tense
Born and raised in the outer lands
And at times you could say I'm out of hand
I'm in a band of gypsies, we're on the run

Then let me know it
Show it, here's your chance
Don't blow it

To the people on the real side
To collide styles because it seems

We got pride in our city, Detroit

Feel like I got to find

You give me brother
Wonder if I really need

Come tomorrow
I'm gonna reach a higher spot

Kid Rock,"Black chick white guy, does it mean shit, maybe?
I don't know but yo, it never fazed me
But either way here's one tale
Of two like that and what prevailed
It started way back in the eighth grade
In the small old town where the two both stayed
He came from a family of middle class
Where everything he did he always had to ask
She came from a place that was so alone
You know the same old tale of a broken home
Her momma was an alkie and more like a friend
Had three different kids from three different men
And that's just the way shit was
Couldn't change it, couldn't rearrange it, so there it was
Anyway the two kept on
With the phone calls notes and so on and so on
And after the bullshit and whattn'
That day came the two started fuckin'
All the time, you know kids' habits
Every single day fuckin' like rabbits
Sneakin' out the car when he was fifteen
Climbin' in the window and fuckin' all night, see
Fuckin' during lunch in the junior high bathrooms
Drinking champagne and trippin' on mushrooms
His dick was metal her pussy was a magnet
Ninth grade came, I'm pregnant
Shit got frantic and man, oh, Lord
It was a tuff decision, but they decided to abort it
It might have been right it might have been wrong
But one thing's for sure it really fucked his head up
Where is it, who is it, how is it, was it right?
These are the things he thought in bed at night
A lot of people might laugh at this
But fuck, 'em they don't know the half of it

Ain't no sunshine when you're low, I'm low
People tell me life's a game I'm not playin'
Bitches don't mean shit to me anymore
I have taken my blows, I'm still standin'

Now as time went on the the two kept on
They kept seeing each other off and on
See she moved to the city and you know what happened
Black chick with a real white accent
Pretty girl in the ghetto, go figure
Yeah, she got macked by some dope-dealin' nigga
Still seein' that other kid on the side
She kept most of her thoughts inside
See all the first guy did was just love her
While that punk mother fucker used to beat her and punch her
She was livin' all wild
I think all she ever wanted was the love of her own child
She asked the first guy to have his baby
He looked at her like she must be crazy
He was makin' records and goin' on tour
Twenty thousand people hip hoppin on the floor
And all that while she sat at home and got macked
If she stepped out of line, she got slapped
And then one day she prayed to the Lord to take that guy away
And he did he got caught with a loaded gun
And went to jail but first she had his son
Oooh, and now what to do?
She had no man, no money and no clue
Now the other guy came back from tourin'
And she called him up early one mornin'
They hooked up her mind was blown
As he began to raise her son as his own
And that's a lot of shit to deal with, man
And if you ain't been there you wouldn't understand
And people still laugh at this shit
Fuck 'em, they don't know the half of it

Ain't no sunshine when you're low, I'm low
People tell me life's a game I'm not playin'
Bitches don't mean shit to me anymore
I have taken my blows, I'm still standin'

Now for the next year there was some good times
A few bad times mostly good times
See, he was a ramblin' man to the bone
He liked women and wine and he loved to roam
Not like she was any kind of saint
See in this story there's a lot of red paint
But time kept slippin' and made her crazy
And she talked about havin' another baby
The guy was like, ""oh Lord""
We got one now that we can't afford
But she convinced she could handle even two
Said ""I want your child or I'm leavin you""
I can't figure out why then he didn't run
I guess he was attached to her and her son
All confused about what to do
That girl met another guy and was fuckin' him too, slut
Could barely pay her rent
And then the same old shit, I'm pregrant
And if that ain't some shit 'cause
The girl didn't even know who the father was
And still by her side the first guy stayed
Head gettin' more fucked by the day
He stuck it out for nine months I don't know why
And then a little girl on the Fourth of July
Was born in the front seat of his car
It was amazing, kinda like a shooting star
He was happy, told his family and friends
Only to realize later his little girl wasn't his
And that crushed him quick
Suicidal thoughts were in his head real thick
But before he found all that out
From the same chick, another kid popped out
And that shit's real ill
Girl told him that she was takin' the fuckin' pill
She must have known all along
The little girl wasn't his and she was tryin' to latch on
Three different kids from three different men
History repeats itself again
And after some more shit got stirred
He kicked that bitch to the curb
And now from her he's got a little boy that makes him laugh a bit, huh
Huh, and he loves him
But still you don't know the fuckin' half of it

Ain't no sunshine when you're low, I'm low
People tell me life's a game I'm not playin'
Bitches don't mean shit to me anymore
I have taken my blows, I'm still standin'
I'm still standin'
I'm still standin'
I am still standin'","Black Chick, White Guy",1998

Used to call me funny when my nose was fucking runny
Now my fuckin' bunnies gettin' fuckin' Matchbox 20 money
Motherfuckers want to claim they're down
But when I was broke and down I never seen 'em around
All the shit we talked, all the shit we dreamed
I did it without you, I got a brand new team
No triple beams, it seems like a movie
Bought two cribs, drop-top, and jacuzzi
No more floozies, only high-class hoes
A couple when it rains and a few when it snows
A brand new nose to go along with my habit
And a garden hose made out of twenty-four karat
Bought a couple parots that like to squak
And they sound like you and all the shit you talk
Step inside my shoes, you couldn't fill em' doc
You're too old to kid, too soft to rock

Daddy's drunk I want to pump pump it up like the Goodyear blimp
Make you high for a dollar that's the way I pimp gold links and minks and shrimp
Dinners on the bayou them is all of the things that ain't gonna by you

People always talkin' what they gonna do, they must want their face to maybe
Taste my shoe, I can't understand all the push and shove, and what the fuck
Happened to the peace and love, who planted that glove? Man I don't care I'm
Too busy running fingers through your momma's hair, I got no time for the
Fakes and the phonies, the crooks and the creeps and the cops and the cronies, am I the only

Record companies stressin' that they all want hits, and yeah I'm body body,
So I make 'em like this, they say ""hey there boy all we need is one song""

Don't want to hear me brag, so I'm grabbing on my thingy while I let my pants

Kid Rock,"I've been sittin' here trying to find myself
I get behind myself I need to rewind myself
Looking for the payback listening for the playback
They say that every man bleeds just like me

And I feel like number one yet I'm last in line
I watch my younger son and it helps to pass the time
I take too many pills that helps to ease the pain
I made a couple of dollare bills still I feel the same

Everybody knows my name they say it way out loud
A lot of folks fuck with me it's hard to hang out in a croud
I guess that's the price you pay to be some big shot like I am
Out stretched hands and one night stands

Still I can't find love
And when the walls are tumbling down
I will always be around
Yeah

And when the walls are tumbling down I will always be around
People don't know about the things I say and do
They don't understand about the shit I've been through
It's been so long since I've been home

I've been gone, I've been gone way too long
Maybe I've forgotten all the things I miss
Oh, somehow I know there is more to life than this
I've said it too many times and I still stand firm

You get what you put in and people get what the deserve
Still I ain't seen mine, no I ain't seen mine
I've been given but just ain't gettin' I've been walkin' that thin line
So I think I'll keep a walking with my head held high

I'll keep moving on and only God knows why

I ain't got time to tighten up loose ends huh
I've been that route too many times
If I ain't stabbed in the back I ain't fightin' no crime

I wish for that which my heart holds near
But ain't nobody playin' what I'm tryin' to hear
I've been sayin' for years that the fakes wouldn't last
You were jockin' that bullshit, now you look like an ass

Get gassed in your garage of sickness
As I bring a little swing into your world of stiffness
'Cause I've got plenty of rhymes to spill
Ain't got nothin' more than time to kill

Form like a blister, drink like a failure
Rip like a twister right through a trailer
Park after dark is when you'll see me comin'
My gun's gunnin' and the 808's hummin'

Raw Raw Rip Rock Rude
Sample anything I like and never get sued
At 18 I had a hardcore attitude
When I turned 19 I was touring with Ice Cube

It's true I broke the old school
Where the rules don't bend and the beats don't end
No place to be I gotta let these knuckles know who the fuck I be
I'm still the (I'm still body rockin' DP MC)

So clap your hands to what he's doing
I'm a razor blade slittin' through a wrist of hate
I'm a contradiction I'm a twist of fate

See me rollin'
You got me rollin'
I'm rollin'
Searchin' underneath the sun

I'm dead as shit, but I ain't been killed
See I'm a Mack, I'm a truck, but I'm Peter built
I am the Trucker and my ego's large
I'm the K to the I call me sarge

Roll number seven raise south of heaven
See my crew comin' hear them Harley's revin'
I'm steppin' to your crew with a glick of hits
Got 3 LP's but I ain't got no hits

And I'm a grateful, hateful, little son of a G
I'm a deadhead runnin' from the D-P-D
Got soul you're plagued with the rhythms cancer
Grab a bowl, you'll be swingin' like a topless dancer

Biltmore Beavers and a Top Dog Coat
Top car 4 Vogues on a hundred spokes
Got a roundtrip ticket to the promised land
If it ain't all that I'll be back my man

Never drop top forty cause I always rock besides

Livin' in sin and it's a beautiful thing

Been chasin' bunnies like a dummy overlookin' my rent
He spent every rent cent puttin' hickeys on his bed
He's rockin' dickie's sipping, lickie slipping, honey's steady
Lookin' for love I put my talent on hold
Told my soul to glow it said get up and go
And so I packed my bags with a whole lot of realness

Tryin' to act that fresh I wish they'd bump into me
'Cause it ain't nothing to me want to eat a little more
Taste a little bit of pride from every drink that I pour
I've been a whore for years showing love to my peers

Never sold for any less than what I see in the mirror
Steer wide to avoid the blows I've been dealt
Let the six strings ride when the twelves are felt
So when you see me tuggin' on the end of my rope
You better raise up or duck when I reach in my coat because

I love all the girls
Smack all the hoes
Show love to those who come real with it

Life's a bitch but I deal with it
I'm in it to win it like Yzerman

Drinking smoking thinking trying to free my mind
I've been sitting here just wasting time
Drinking smoking trying to free my mind

It's been a couple of months in this smokey room
Eaten shrooms drinking Boones writing tunes
And hoping to get one of these mother fuckin' songs to hit

A little bit of love that's all I need
A little inspiration and a bag of weed
A seed to plant so my tree can grow
You know I left my girl 'cause I need that hold up

Wait a minute I'm about to flow
Like a breeze through the trees you can watch me blow
Puffing a Winston drinking a four-o
Kid Rock and I'm gonna let you know

I've been sitting here just wasting time

Ain't no tough guy

Born in the game that's all I am

Giving all my duckets to Uncle Sam
Fuck it
I'm free to do what I please little lady
I was born at night but not last night baby

I've been around, seen some things
I slept in dumpsters, got high with kings
I don't bring much, ain't gotta lot to say
But I got more time than Morris day

Detroit's city where I was born
When I was young I knew I'd always be
A super live body rockin' MC

I'm T-N-T I'm dynamite
And I'm gonna rock this party all damn night
I've got the gift of gab I can walk the walk

Sayin' goo-goo ga-ga
I gotta lotta time to eat MC's like piranhas
I'm a pro at this, yeah the ultimate
'Cause I don't spit, my rap too quick

I'm the ladies pick all around the world
But I only got eyes for just one girl
I don't twirl around like a ballerina
I roll through towns and I rock arenas

I may seem a little under age
But at least I am not under paid
I'm one of a kind here to shock your mind
And I will serve no rhymes before their time

The K-K-Kid Rock, that is my name
And if you ask me again, I'll tell you the same
Who's to blame I don't really know
But my game's so tight I think I'm gonna go pro

So here we go here here we go
I'm gonna rock it up high, then rock it down low
From the floor to the ceiling to the living room
'Cause people like to hear my bass go boom boom boom ba boom

The one two three the three two one
Don't stop me now I've just begun
Don't cut me down don't start no fight
Or I'll put my foot in your ass tonight

I'm outta sight, like the planet Mars
And when I set my sights I shoot for stars
I don't like small cars or real big women
But somehow I always find myself in 'em

I'm a hidden gem, a rollin' stone
I'm a one man band with a microphone
Here to make you shake and move your body
So come on in and welcome to the party

I'm gonna rock it for Dixie to suit your fancy
Rock your pants off and party my dick off
People want to know when's the tour gonna kick off

I'm no rip-off , it's all original
Not too political a little cynical
About the fakes and squakers that talk a lot of Ku-ca
I know a lot of chicks that like to call me poppa

Don't start drama mack in the Bahamas
Rock on the dance floor to din dada
'Cause I'm a player that you love to hate

Lickin' pussy underwater shootin' bubbles up your ass
I'm so crass that I'm the last of my kind
Me, Slick Willie in the DC Shrine

Sometimes I rhyme just for kicks

Kid Rock,"Black chick white guy
Does it mean shit maybe
I don't know but yo it never phased me
But either way here's one tail

Of two like that and what prevailed
It started way back in the 8th grade
In the small old town where the two both stayed
He came from a family of middle class

Where everything he did he always had to ask
She came from a place that was so alone
You know the same old tail of a broken home
Her momma was an alkie and more like a friend

Had three different kids from three different men
And that's just the way shit was 
Couldn't change it couldn't rearrange it so there it was
Anyway the two kept on

With the phone calls notes and so on and so on
And after the bullshit and whatten
That day came the two started fuckin'
All the time you know kids habit's

Every single day fuckin' like rabbits
Sneakin out the car when he was 15 
Climbin' in the window and fuckin' all night see
Fuckin' during lunch in the junior high bathrooms

Drinking champagne and trippin' on mushrooms
His dick was metal her pussy was a magnet
9th grade came, I'm pregnant
Shit got frantic and man oh Lord it was a tuff decision

But they decided to abort it
It might have been right it might have been wrong
But one thing's for sure it really fucked his head up
Where is it who is it how is it was it right

These are the things he thought in bed at night
A lot of people might laugh at this
But fuck 'em they don't know the half of it

Ain't no sunshine when you're low
I'm low
People tell me life's a game I'm not playin'
Bitches don't mean shit to me anymore
I have taken my blows I'm still standin'

Now as time went on the the two kept on
They kept seeing each other off and on
See she moved to the city and you know what happened
Black chic with a real white accent

Pretty girl in the ghetto go figure
Yeah she got macked by some dope dealin' nigger
Still seein' that other kid on the side
She kept most of her thoughts inside

See all the first guy did was just love her
While that punk mother fucker used to beat her and punch her
She was livin' all wild
I think all she ever wanted was the love of her own child

She asked the first guy to have his baby
He looked at her like she must be crazy
He was makin' records and goin' on tour
20,000 people hip hoppin on the floor

And all that while she sat at home and got macked
If she stepped out of line she got slapped
And then one day she prayed to the Lord to take that guy away
And he did he got caught with a loaded gun

And went to jail but first she had his son
Ooohh and now what to do
She had no man no money and no clue
Now the other guy came back from tourin'

And she called him up early one mornin'
They hooked up her mind was blown
As he began to raise her son as his own
And that's a lot of shit to deal with man

And if you ain't been there you wouldn't understand
And people still laugh at this shit
Fuck 'em they don't know the half of it

Ain't no sunshine when you're low
I'm low
People tell me life's a game I'm not playin'
Bitches don't mean shit to me anymore
I have taken my blows I'm still standin'

Now for the next year there was some good times
A few bad times mostly good times
See he was a ramblin' man to the bone
He liked women and wine and he loved to roam

Not like she was any kind of Saint
See in this story there's a lot of red paint
But time kept slippin' and made her crazy
And she talked about havin' another baby

The guy was like Oooh Lord
We got one now that we can't afford
But she convinced she could handle two
Said I want your child or I'm leavin you

I can't figure out why then he didn't run
I guess he was attached to her and her son
All confused about what to do
That girl met another guy and was fuckin' him too slut

Could barely pay her rent
And then the same old shit, I'm pregrant
And if that ain't some shit 'cause
The girl didn't even know who the father was

And still by her side the first guy stayed
Head gettin' more fucked by the day
He stuck it out for nine months I don't know why
And then a little girl on the Fourth of July

Was born in the front seat of his car
It was amazing
Kinda like a shooting star
He was happy told his family and friends

Only to realize later his little girl wasn't his
And that crushed him quick
Suicidal thoughts were in his head real thick
But before he found all that out

From the same chic another kid popped out
And that shit's real ill
Girl told him that she was takin' the fuckin' pill
She must have known all along

The little girl wasn't his and she was tryin' to latch on
Three different kids from three different men
History repeats itself again
And after some more shit got stirred

He kicked that bitch to the curb
And now from her he's got a little boy that makes him laugh a bit
And he loves him
But still you don't know the fuckin' half of it

Ain't no sunshine when you're low
I'm low
People tell me life's a game I'm not playin'
Bitches don't mean shit to me anymore

Slim Shady and Brown Trucker another bunch of mother fuckers 
Who hate the world just as much as each other 
And I ain't leaving this party tonight 
'Til I see some naked bitches dancin' around drunk touchin' each other 

Rum and Pepsi got your perception of me sketchy 
'Cause when I stage dive people are scared to catch me 
'Cause all I do is curse and fuck 
So when I do 'shrooms you all better give me two rooms 

'Cause I'm fuckin' the first one up 
So when you see me on your block you better lock your cars 
'Cause you know I'm losin' it when I'm rappin' to rock guitars 
This is for children who break rules 

People that straight fool 
And ever single teenager that hates school

Kid Rock,"It ain't nothing but a party here
From the early evening til the break of day
So step this way and let your mind be free
And by the way... ""welcome to the party""

Well my name's Kid Rock I'm a Capricorn
Detroit's city where I was born
When I was young I knew I'd always be
A super live body rockin' MC

I'm T-N-T I'm dynamite
And I'm gonna rock this party all damn night
I've got the gift of gab I can walk the walk
I became an emcee when I learned to talk

Sayin' goo-goo ga-ga
I gotta lotta time to eat MC's like pirhanas
I'm a pro at this, yeah the ultimate
'Cause I don't spit, my rap too quick

I'm the ladies pick all around the world
But I only got eyes for just one girl
I don't roll twirl like a ballarena
I roll through towns and I rock arenas

I may seem a little under age
But at least I am not under paid
I'm one of kind here to shock your mind
And I will serve no rhymes before their time

The K-K-Kid Rock, that is my name
And if you ask me again, I'll tell you the same
Who's to blame I don't really know
But my game's so tight I think I'm gonna go pro

So here we go here here we go
I'm gonna rock it up high, then rock it down low
From the floor to the ceiling to the living room
'Cause people like to hear my bass go boom boom boom ba boom

The one two three the three two one
Don't stop me know I've just begun
Don't cut me down don't start no fight
Or I'll put my foot in your ass tonight

I'm outta sight, like the planet Mars
And when I set my sights I shoot for stars
I don't like small cars or real big women
But somehow I always find myself in 'em

I'm a hidden gem, a rollin' stone
I'm a one man band with a microphone
Here to make you shake and move your body
So come on in and welcome to the party

[Chorus]
It ain't nothing but a party hey
From the early evening to the break of day
So step this way and let your mind be free
And by the way welcome to the party

Uh uh excuse me Mr. Kid Rock can I do my thing Can I have a
little something to say right here
""Oh yeah go ahead baby""

I'm a real live show and you can watch me throw
I'm the M to the L and I'll let ya know
Alize is too sweet and it'll make ya fat
I've got a pound of dank and a gallon of Kognack

I'm all of that and a bag of chips
I'm the whole damn party mix
I'm the chick that doesn't seem all too classy
You can't party with me but you can kiss my *Whistle*

[Chorus]

Hey Grandmaster 5 that old school shit's fresh
But uh let's rock some of that fuckin' 1998 Kid Rock shit bro

I'm an Irish lad, but don't call me Clancy
I'm gonna rock it for Dixie to suit your fancy
Rock your pants off and party my dick off
People want to know when's the tour gonna kick off

I'm no rip-off , it?s all original
Not too political...a little cynical
About the fakes and squakers that talk a lot of Ku-ca
I know a lot of chicks that like to call me poppa

Don't start drama...mack in the bahamas
Rock on the dance floor to din dada
'Cause I'm a player that you love to hate
Got your girl suckin' dick on video tape

I like pussy...suckin' on titties
Fucked a lot of different bitches from a bunch of different cities
Kid Rock and I'm the same old fool
I'll tell ya to drop your boyfriend then drop outta high school

I got a whirlpool...don't even ask
Lickin' pussy underwater shootin' bubbles up your ass
I'm so crass that I'm the last of my kind
Me, Slick Willie in the DC Shrine

Sometimes I rhyme just for kicks
Forget the bullshit and bust like this
I don't steal from the rich and give to the poor
I take from my bitches from give it to my whores

What up I'm saying everybody
You get fucked up and i'll rock the party

Unknown to the hot zone, million dollar home

So if your rap's wrapped in jack, sweep it under the rug
'Cause I'ma go above that, beyond the calls of my fuckin' duty
'Cause all these corney, phony emcee's now a days don't move me
So I'm a show it proof G, so make waves
I got a full time pay, start to dig graves
Because I'm buryin' emcee's, and sharin' their ladies
Now you rolled hoes are carrying my babies
Grab me it never hurt no one
A broken home always hurts someone
Grab me it never hurt no one
I saw kids get shot, don't sell guns

And still I rip it, flip it, grip it like a real one does
Rockin', shockin' on the stage, with a hell a steady buzz
From a 5th of ol' Jimmy Beam
We fryin' emcees up just like some motherfucking Jimmy Dean
Sausage pattys, and smoking cabbies like it's no thing
Drinkin' more Colt's then the 45 king
Swingin' emcees like a cow hands rope
And if the guns too loud, oh boy, I'm straight slittin' throats

Every time I get my gamble on
Yeah that's the way I like to do shit, holmes

Feel like I got bank, but it's not enough friend

With my own two hands
We've traveled this land packed tight in minivans
And all this for the fans, girls, money, and fame

I play their game, and then they scream my name
I will show no shame, I live and die for this
If I come off soft, then chew on this
Are you scared?

Devil without cause, and I'm back
With the Beaver hat and Ben Davis slacks
30-pack of Stroh's, 30-pack of hoes
No rogaine in the propane flows

Chosen one, I'm the living proof
With the gift of gab from the city of truth
I jabbed and stabbed and knocked critics back
And I did not stutter

When I said that I'm goin platinum, sellin rhymes
I went platinum, seven times
And still they ill they want to see us fry
I guess because of only God knows why why why why why

Oh, they call me cowboy, I'm the singer in black

Skynyrd, Seger, Limp, Korn, the Stones
David Allen Coe, and No Show Jones

Got the rock from Detroit and soul from Motown
The underground stoned fuckin pimp
With tracks that mack and slap back the whack

Never get in the way, I don't play with with that
But watch me rock with Liberace flash
Punk rock the Clash, Boy Bands are trash

Watch me kick, you can roll with Rock
Or you can suck my dick
I'm a porno flick, I'm like Amazing Grace

I'm gunna fuck some hoes after I rock this place
Superfly living doublewide
Side car on my Glide so Joe see can ride
Full sack to share, bringin' flash and flair

Got the long hair swinging, middle finger in the air
Snake skin suits, 65 Chevelle
See me ride in sin hear the rebel yell
I won't live to tell, so if you do

Give the next generation a big 'fuck you'
Who knew I'd blow up like Oklahoma
Said fuck high school, pissed on my diploma
Smell the aroma, check my hits
I know it stinks in here, cause I'm the Shit

Oh, they call me cowboy, I'm the singer in black
Throw me the finger in the air, let me see where you're at
And say hey, hey

Kid Rock,"See I was born a little pie-eyed motherfucker
Mama she left me and my papa was a hard trucker
Out on the highway we loved to roll
He never made me go to school

I never begged to go
I was a low class livin' raised out in the sticks
I was born to be a hick
See I love to spend my days just a squirrel huntin'

Go see my cousin Ellie May and get some good lovin'
Kissin' and huggin' on some distant lands
People always tell me I'm a twisted man
Jim Beam in my hand boones kegged in shit

Fuck Off
Unlike me you're gonna run away 
Unlike me you'll see another day
Run like me out on the highway
I will ride so far
I'll probably never make it there

I never went to college
I ain't got no skills
I got hair to my shoulders
And a bottle of pills
I got bills stacked up
Like a turkey club
I blew my last dime drinkin
At the local pub

I am not sunshine
I am dark and grey
For this life of sins 
I live, each day I pay
I am not jesus
But I died in vein
Only to relive each day I'll pay

Unlike me you're gonna run away
Unlike me you'll see another day
Run like me, out on the highway
I will ride so far

You can't stop y'all
Rock rock y'all
To the beat y'all
Check it out y'all
You come alive y'all
Come on

I never felt at home
Although I grew up loved
I got a junkies mind
In a ramblin man's blood
Got a flood full of thoughts
That's caught in a dam
Somedays I'm gone
But that's where I am
I'm fit to slip
Another rippin rhyme
I'm so ahead of the game
I feel left behind
Another dime to boost
I got boots of lead
Hope I live to see
This pirate's bread

I am not sunshine
I am dark and grey
For this life of sins I live
Each day I pay
I am not jesus

Black hoes sayin' that honky's fine

Gettin' mine, just like I'm supposed to
And if you fuck with the Rock, I'll roast you
A little toast to the real MC's
Ain't no love for the wannabe's

So, hey ho don't call me Joe
'Cause the Joe's I know, can't even flow
I can battle rap, and all that other crap
So if ya don't want none, better step to the back

I'm from the motherfuckin' old school
Basement party's in the Clem fool
Talkin' that trash, I wish you would
Come step to Rock, it's all good

Kind bud, be the bud's I'm tokin'

Mid western funk, and I'm the best bitch

The K to the I to the chrome D's
In the Grand Marquees sippin' O-E
Pimpin' Rock, it's my name, my game
Servin' you hoe's like it ain't no thang

If ya don't, just step to the rear son
'Cause I'm commin with the quickness
If you dis this bitch, you'll wind up on my hit list

I'm here and it's clear I'm gonna flow so yo black
Just get on up or yo get the bozak 
'Cause it ain't Kojak or Dr. Suess

It's the kid mother fucker and I'm gonna get loose 
'Cause I got the juice to spruce and get nice and
So enticing strong like a bison 
Ruff like brandy and no one knows

That I got more riffs than Randy Rhoads 
Smash, slash and when I trash I bash
I get ill I chill but you don't know the half 
I trip I rip and though I think I'm slick

I'm nothin' but a funky country hick 
But I still get down with a sound that pumps
And you can hear me from the trucks and the trunks that bump 
Never been questioned by the F.B.I

Although I've tried every method just to get high 
L.S.D. is what I'm trippin on
And O.E. bitch is what I'm sippin on 
A big fat booty's what I'm grippin on

But for now I'm gonna rock and keep rippin on 
Down to the mother fuckin A.M.
As I co bump and jump and keep the crowd in mayhem 
No brain no pain...Now c'mon y'all and tell me what's my name

3 sheets 2 the wind is the state I'm in
Half off the wagon with my feet draggin 
Taggin' hoes gettin' lots of trim
Gettin' jocks and props for all the spots I rock 

I'm true I'm blue like Captain Kangaroo
And for the few who knew yo I'm a bang for you 
Because the Kid Rock ain't no bitch yo
And I ain't no radio want to get rich ho 

So count my props you can't get with me and fuck all you cops you ain't shit to me 
But hoes with guns playin' hard for fun
So stay off my dick because I ain't the one 
And for anyone tryin' to bust me up

You better chill with that tryin' to fuck me up 
And if you're talkin' shit I'm gonna shut ya up
And all ya wack D.J.'s I'm gonna cut ya up

I cease the cheese M.C,'s I moe down 
And I show no shame 'cause I'm down for mine
