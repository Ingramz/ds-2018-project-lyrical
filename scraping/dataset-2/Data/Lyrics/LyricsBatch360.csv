Herman Jarong,"She rolls the window down
And she
Talks over the sound
Of the cars that pass us by
And I don't know why
But she's changed my mind

Would you look at her
She looks at me
She's got me thinking about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel
And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out
I'm crazy for this girl
Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl

She was the one to hold me
The night
The sky fell down
And what was I thinking when
The world didn't end
Why didn't I know what I know now

Would you look at her
She looks at me
She's got me thinking about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel
And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out
I'm crazy for this girl
Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl

Right now
Face to face
All my fears
Pushed aside
And right now
I'm ready to spend the rest of my life
With you

Would you look at her
She looks at me
She's got me thinking about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel
And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out
I'm crazy for this girl
Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl

Would you look at her
She looks at me
She's got me thinking about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel
And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out
I'm crazy for this girl
Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl",Crazy for This Girl,2001
Herman Jarong,"Once again I just can't get it straight
Wondering if wandering is my fate
Don't lose hope in me quite yet
'Cause help must be on the way
Any day

From my head to my heart
Can't seem to find a way, they're so far apart
It's not you, it's not your fault
You've got everything I could ever want
And you've always understood my intentions are good
And we've been so close from the start
But the furthest distance I've ever known
Is from my head to my heart

I feel the distance standing here next to you
I don't want to keep you waiting, but I've been waiting too
Some day if I get there
And you still want me too
We can see it through

From my head to my heart
Can't seem to find a way, they're so far apart
It's not you, it's not your fault
You've got everything I could ever want
And you've always understood my intentions are good
And we've been so close from the start
But the furthest distance I've ever known
Is from my head to my heart

From my head to my heart
Can't seem to find a way, they're so far apart
It's not you, you've got everything I could ever want

And we've been so close from the start

Is from my head to my heart",From My Head to My Heart,2001
Herman Jose,"Parava no café quando ela estava
Na voz tinha o talento dos pedintes
Entre um cigarro e outro lá cravava a bica
Ao melhor dos seus ouvintes

As mãos e o olhar da mesma cor
Cinzenta como a roupa que trazia
Num gesto que podia ser de amor
Sorria, e ao partir agradecia

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

Um dia numa sala do quarteto
Passou um filme lá do hospital
Onde o esquecido filmado no gueto
Entrava como artista principal

Compramos a entrada p'ra sessão
Pra ver tal personagem no écran
O rosto maltratado era a razão
D'eu não aparecer pela manhã

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

Mudamos muita vez de calendário
Como o café mudou de freguesia
Deixamos de tributo a quem lá pára
Um louco a fazer-lhe companhia

É sempre a mesma posse o mesmo olhar
De quem não mede os dias que vagueam
Sentado la continua a cravar
Beijinhos as meninas que passeiam

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar",Loucos de Lisboa,2017
Herman Kenin,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Herman Merritt,"I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold,
I'd rather be His than have riches untold
I'd rather have Jesus than houses or land,
Yes, I'd rather be led by His nail-pierced hand.

Than to be the king of a vast domain
And be held in sin's dread sway
I'd rather have Jesus than anything
This world affords today.

I'd rather have Jesus than worldly applause,
I'd rather be faithful to His dear cause
I'd rather have Jesus than worldwide fame,
I'd rather be true to His holy name.

Than to be the king of a vast domain
And be held in sin's dread sway
I'd rather have Jesus than anything

Herman Olivera,"Eche, amigo, no mas, echeme y llene
hasta el borde la copa de champan
que esta noche de farra y de alegria
el dolor que hay en mi alma quiero ahogar.
Es la ultima farra de mi vida
de mi vida muchachos que se va...
Mejor dicho se ha ido tras de aquella
que no supo mi amor nunca apreciar.

Yo la quise, muchachos y la quiero
y jamás yo la podre olvidar...
Yo me emborracho por ella
y ella quien sabe que hara`...
Eche mozo más champan,
que todo mi dolor
bebiendo lo he de ahogar
Y si la ven
amigos, diganle
que ha sido por su amor
que mi vida ya se fue`.

Y brindemos, no mas,
la ultima copa
que, tal vez, también ella ahora estara`
ofreciendo en algun brindis su boca
y otra boca febril la besara`.

Herman Rarebell,"Well my pad is very messy
And there's whiskers on my chin
And I'm all hung up on music
And I always play to win
I ain't got no time for lovin'
Cause my time is all used up
Just to sit around creatin'
All that groovy kind of stuff.
I'm a man
Yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so
I'm a man
Yes I am 
And I can't help
But love you so.
Well if I had my choice of matter
I would rather be with cats
All engrossed in mental chatter
Moving where our minds are at
And relating to each other
Just how strong our wills can be
I'm resisting all involvement
With each groovy chick we see
Well I'm a man
Yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so
I'm a man
Yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so.
I got to keep my image
While suspended from a throne
That looks out upon a kingdom
Full of people all unknown
Who imagine I'm not human
And my heart is made of stone
I never had no problems
And my toilet's trimmed with chrome

Herman Rarebell,"Met her down at that Tokyo place
Loved her pretty face
I said: ""Hey, you're alright, so alright!""
I was sitting in her car
She told me: ""You're a star and I know you.""

She said: ""Take me home.""
I need love so strong
Come on and knock me out, oh!
I've been too long alone
I want hot love, you know, and I need it now!""

She said: ""Hey, let's go, don't put on a show
You're just another piece, another piece of meat""
She said: ""Hey, let's go, don't put on a show
You're just another piece 
Another piece of meat.""

Next day she took me out
To a rough kick boxing show
Violence really turned her on, oh no
She was screaming for more blood
Loved it more than any drug I couldn't stand it

Herman Rarebell,"There's something wrong, but I can't be sure
I gotta know cause I'm feeling good
You've got me girl so I just can't move
If I don't head for ground. then I'm bound to lose!
Don't go giving me all your reasons
I can see them but they'll hurt me I know
Cause if the time should come, that you'll be leaving
Will I have the strength to let you go
I'll play the clown, when I'm insecure
I close my eyes if I'm not too sure
But things you do make me want to shout
Let's give it time, and work it out
Every time you think you've got it made, you stand
Last, don't you think that I can't stand this pain
Forever again well oh no...
I've crossed the line, so I just can't lose it
I'm tied and bound and I can't abuse it
And all the things we've been fighting for
We'll break it loose, I can take some more
Don t go giving me all your reasons
I can see them, but they'll hurt me I know
Cause if the time should come that you'll be leaving
Will I have the strength to let you go!
Please stop bringing me all your reasons

Cause if the time should come that you'll be leaving
Only hope that I will understand!",Armed and Ready,2012
Herman Rarebell,"You put me down, that's what I said
I hit the clouds and you kicked me in the head
Ain't that a strange thing for you to do I'll never get it now together we were new
I don't need this, you don't want that
I wonder when you're gonna get upon my back
You'd better keep me just while you may
You'd better stick around or get out the way

[Chorus:]
Why don't you want me
You cannot know
Why love me
Then go

Just straighten out your head and mind
Forget about the things that make you draw the line
Don't want to take warnings from you
Can't have much more of this what are you tryin' to do

There's got to be some other way
It's time to work it out
Turn it blue from gray

Herman Rarebell,"A time of fear, so long ago,
Lived a man in Salon,
In his dark and magic room,
He gazed on times to come,
All is then revealed, and visions on water speak true!
Cry for the nations, cry for the nations.
A flash of light, fills the night,
And chills the blood in his veins,
Will the power possess his mind, soul in chains
All is then revealed, and tears that he shed were for you
Cry for the nations, cry for the nations.
Battles of kings, and of fools,
And changes in ways he once knew,
As pages of days fade away
He's lost in time...

What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

Maar al worden we ook wrakker, al dat vreselijke snuffen
Zal tenminste niet meer hoeven gaar of muf we zijn gebaken
En we zeggen kijk de tram of hoor jij die vogel zingen
Als die nutteloze dingen want het hoeft niet meer adrem

En het hoeft niet meer zo rap, want we moeten nergens heen
Och we wonen toch alleen in zo'n rothuis met een trap
Ik beloof je dat ik dan het attend zijn aan zal leren
En ik zal ook vaak proberen of jij nog wel lachen kan

Lachen als een oude dame, die haar zegje heeft gezegd
Die als zij word afgelegd zich voor niemand hoeft te schamen
Wel wel wel, zo zal dat gaan en we sterven heel bedaard
Op een donderdag in maart, tegelijk daar hecht ik aan
En als onze aardse last met de wereld gaat vergroeien
Zal uit jou een bloempje bloeien, een viooltje dat staat vast",Later,1987

Tergde en hen de mantels van het lichaam trok
Dat wij samen - de regen kletterde bij stromen
Schuilden en jij zo schrok

Toen ik je zei dat dit het eind was, en voorgoed
Onze wegen zouden scheiden
""Mijn arme kind, 't is droevig maar het moet
Beter is het heen te gaan"", ik zweeg en jij schreide

Weet je nog? dat mijn hand de jouwe
Zachtjes drukte, omdat jij spoedig zou zien
Dat ik niet de beste was
En dat jij door je tranen lachte en zei: ""Misschien!""

Nu is het herfst opnieuw en regen, maar alleen
Schuil ik onder 't lover, denk aan jou en - ween",Weet Je Nog,1987

Herman Van Veen,"In een motel zag ik een man met grijze haren.
Hij vroeg mij waarom Yanks niet populair meer waren.
Hij toonde mij de hemel van Ohio
Vol stars and stripes and maneschijn.
Ik voelde mij heel Hollands

Oho, Ohio, God bless America.

Hij had ons nog verlost van Hitlers honden,
Ze waren de aardigste soldaten die bestonden

Met Doris Day en I am getting
Sentimental over you, ou

Toen hij ook nog Vietnam wilde bevrijden,
Kreeg hij last van de veranderende tijden.

Dan zouden jullie nu met hamers en met sikkels lopen.""

""Misschien zou dat wel beter zijn.

Herman Van Veen,"Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You won't forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one

All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight
From within, the dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade
Oh, what a lovely couple they made

Put his arms around your waist, held you tight
Kisses I could almost taste in the night
Wondered why I'm not the guy who's silhouette's on the shade
I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Lost control and rang your bell I was sore
Let me in, or else I'll beat down your door
When two strangers who have been two silhouettes on the shade
Said, to my shock, ""you're on the wrong block.""

Rushed out to your house with wings on my feet
Loved you like I'd never loved you, my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade

All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight
From within, the dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade
Oh what a lovely couple they made

Put his arms around your waist, held you tight
Kisses I could almost taste in the night
Wondered why I'm not the guy who's silhouette's on the shade
I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah...
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah...

Lost control and rang your bell, I was sore
Let me in or else I'll beat down your door
When two strangers who have been two silhouettes on the shade
Said to my shock ""you're on the wrong block""

Rushed out to your house with wings on my feet
Loved you like I'd never loved you my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade

Dáme el vino de tu amor. 
Ven conmigo a hacer locuras. 
No hay mañana en que pensar. 
Solo hoy. 
Di que sientes el hechizo 
De la música en tu piel, 
Y abandónate en los brazos 
De la magia de la noche otra vez. 

Para mi ese ritmo total 
Que hay en tus venas latiendo al compas 
Para mi ese algo especial. 
Viva la música, dámelo ya. 

Esta vez será para siempre. 
Agarrados eter-namente. 
Solo se siente la noche tu y yo, 
Y una rumba que no se calla. 
Sique el ritmo alla donde vaya. 
Nadie podrá detenernos, ya no. 
Dime que si. 
Ten compasión. 

Para mi ese ritmo total

Hermanos Rojos,"Monday night I feel so low
Count the hours they go so slow
I know the sound of your voice
Can save my soul
City lights, streets of gold
Look out my window to the world below
Moves so fast and it feels so cold
And I`m all alone

Don`t let me die
I`m losing my mind
Baby just give me a sign

And now that you`re gone
I just wanna be with you
And I can`t go on
I wanna be with you
Wanna be with you

I can`t sleep and I`m up all night
Through these tears I try to smile
I know the touch of your hand
Can save my life
Don`t let me down
Come to me now
I got to be with you some how

And now that you`re gone
I just wanna be with you
And I can`t go on
I wanna be with you
Wanna be with you

And now that you`re gone
Who am I with-out you now
I can`t go on
I just wanna be with you

And now that you`re gone
I just wanna be with you
And I can`t go on
I wanna be with you

Hermanos Vasquez,"Estos eran, dos amigos 
Que venian de Mapimi 
Que por no venirse de oquis 
Robaron Guanacevi 
 
Ellos traiban, dos caballos 
Un oscuro y un jovero 
En el oscuro cargan ropa 
Y en el jovero el dinero 
 
También traiban, maquinaria 
Y muy buenas baterías 
Para desclavar los rieles 
Y hacer los cambios de via 
 
Martín le dice a José
No te pongas amarillo 
Vamos a robar el tren 
Que viene de Vermejillo 
 
Amarillo no me pongo 
Amarillo es mi color 
He robado trenes grandes 
Y maquinas de vapor 
 
Válgame el santo niñito 
Ya agarraron a José
En la esquina del mercado 
Lo ataron y se les fue 
 
Sería por sus oraciones 
Que su madre le rezaba 
Sería por su buena suerte 
Que a José no le tocaba",Los Dos Amigos,2004

We're gonna celebrate our love among the stars
I will be yours and you will be mine
Until the sun begins to shine

VÃ­ctimas de vÃ­ctimas transcurren sin pensar,
Que dÃ­a a dÃ­a el desierto va creciendo.
Why el descontento del joven trabajador,
SerÃ¡ su perdiciÃ³n.

No juegues a esconderte
Pues el miedo a la muerte
Tergiversa los valores.

why ahogado en escapismos
De un siglo en decadencia
Tiembla el planeta con tanta inconciencia.

Tras la cruz se descubrirÃ¡ la ruta enorme.
Why la eternidad, darÃ¡ libertad al nuevo hombre.

Resistirse al sucio poder, es vivir sin temer.
Salirse del molde oficial, ganar o perder.
Desaparecer.
Ganar o perder.
Desaparecer.
Ganar o perder.

Desaparecer, ganar o perder.

Sepultado en el suelo.
Explotado why silenciado.
Frente al rÃ­o poluÃ­do,
Que evidencia el sistema acabado.

Basta, nada hay que ocultar.
Muerto estoy aquÃ­.
Tras el porvenir.

Demorados contra el paredon.
Controlados por el represor.
Sometidos al circo de la tonta identidad,
Para esconder el basurero nuclear.

Basta, nada hay que ocultar.
Muerto estoy aqui.
Tras el porvenir.

Sin futuro, sin piedad.
Sin conciencia fraternal.
Han mutado la raÃ­z,
Aniquilando el paÃ­s, tu paÃ­s, mi paÃ­s.

Conformada why aburrida
Es la enferma sociedad ladina.
Que usa las reglas de la creencia oficial,
Para esconder su hipocresÃ­a.

Tanta mierda en torno a mi.

Sin conciencia fraternal.

Time goes by

You know we're living

You need a lift, they pull you down
The system's got it wrong
I'm a working man and I'm proud of it
So let's get something on
We blow things up and knock
Things down
And make some people sad
It's quite a world in which we live
When good things turn to bad

Let's break out while we can
Achieving all one's destiny is beyond

What to do when you're pushed around
Led neatly by the hand
Your life's made up
You're a working man
So make a final stand

Our favorite song was on the radio
I thought I'd call you just to say hello,
Hello
It didn't really matter
You weren't there

The thoughts I'd had for such a fine
Romance
In all my dreams I always get the chance
I wish it were forever
Do you care

Friends keep saying that I'm wasting
Time
I'm not the type that listens
This heart of mine gives me my vision

My heart beats
To the beat of love
My heart beats
Baby you know it should
My heart beats
To the beat of love for you, for you
My heart beats
To the beat of love
My heart beats
And baby you know it should
My heart beats
To the beat of love for you

All of my thoughts I try to sublimate
It's only you that makes me hesitate
It didn't really matter
At the start

I get so cold inside when I'm alone
But then I see you in the world of my
Own, alone
I wish it were forever
From my heart

Friends keep saying that I'm wasting
Time
I'm not the type that listens
This heart of mine gives me my vision

My heart beats
To the beat of love

That is love

Looking through a magazine
I find a picture of you, girl
A photograph I'd never seen
I see my fears have come true, girl
Looking at a face I knew so well
Hiding your emotions all too well
It's not surprising the things you've
Been through
I know you were so lonely for a time
But now I hear that all your life's in line
This feeling's got to be true for you
Girl

That is love
That is love you're feeling now
That is love
That is love
That is love you're feeling now
That is love

Holding on to all your dreams
Must have been hard on you
It could've gone the way you dreamed
If only I knew what to do
And now I hear you've finally found
Someone
There isn't any reason, girl, to run
It's not so easy, I know, to relax
Now that I've grown I sympathise
Understand and realise
My intentions are from the heart
Girl

That is love
That is love you're feeling now
That is love
That is love... girl
That is love you're feeling now
That is love

The time was right to say goodbye
I'm not sure you understood
Your love for me was clear to see
You did everything you could
I felt ashamed, I was to blame
For all that I did wrong
Now your heart has a place and I'm
Sure it's in haste to re-start

Someterme a su hechizo, olvidando mentir

Y no dónde ir
Y subes otro nivel, y no puedes llegar
Ni siquiera a tocarlo

Y de terrenal sabrás lo celeste
Un oscuro derecho a la delicia
Será un sueño o será mentira

Vuelven fundamentales
Eliminando los moldes del azar
Como se agita el viento sin alimento
Escucha mi canto abierto de par en par

Es el opio la flor de la pereza
Hasta que llego a ser sólo existencia
El humo de leche muge lento
Extendiendo el sabor del universo

Replegado en la madriguera
Como un animal acosado
Bajo el efecto de la adormidera
Y el peso de mis pestañas

Las cosas más triviales se
Vuelven fundamentales
Eliminando los moldes del azar
Como se agita el viento sin alimento
Escucha mi canto abierto de par en par

Esquirlas de aire
Arcano indescifrable
En el jardín de mis delicias
Pertenezco a la brisa

Inhalo la niebla
Que flota en el Ganges
El aceite de incienso
Nos servirá de consuelo

With a girl from the other side

Each time you break away, I fear you've gone to stay.
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow, bringing you back again,
Hurting me more and more.

'Cause each day that passes by you got me
Never knowing if I'm coming or going, but I, I love you.
This old heart darling, is weak for you.
I love you, yes, I do.
These old arms of mine miss having you around;
Makes these tears inside start a-falling down.

'Cause each day that passes by you got me

This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin'

This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin' the way you treat me,
Leaves me incomplete, you're here for the day, gone for the week, now
But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back.
I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it.

so when he wants you you have to stay
you have to hold him it's the only way

only somewhere inside him
it's the only place he's found
where no fences surround him

you might find him in the darkness kneeling
he's found no reason for this love he's feeling
so when he wants you now and again
don't let the time slip past you all in vain
all in vain

there he goes along the wall
catch him now before he falls
while he tries to break the chains
that bind what's gone to what remains

Elle est bien quand je suis avec elle 
Elle est là près de moi et c'est toi

Oui, en aimant toutes celles qui m'ont pris 
Dans leurs mains, dans leurs yeux, j'ai appris 
On a qu'un seul amour dans la vie.

Ich wollt raus in die Gassen, eintausend Gramm pro Tag war doch keine große Sache
Damals, war ich gierig, ich wollt mehr von dem Scheiß
Hielt immer das Angebot niedrig und verschärfte den Preis
Denn, zu viele Opfas, die dir meist Honig ums Maul schmiern
Denn der ganze Ott macht kommt mir so nicht ins Haus, hier
Läuft das anders, als Vollbluthustler ist man nun mal vorbelastet, Standard, Drogen ticken, ganztags
Mich auf mein Leben feiern, täglich, ballern alles war so leicht, es
Ging auf Herz fernab von Karriereleitern
Aus dem Nichts standen acht Wichser vor der Tür
Ich hatte Glück und wurde nicht dem Haftrichter vorgeführt
Alles ging zu schnell, plötzlich ist man vorbestraft

Opfer sagen viele Dinge, weil wir fighten und
Doch immerhin bleibt ein Wort und bei Nacht komm ich dich holen

Messer zücken, in den Rücken, nur weil ihr keine Eier habt
Packt die Klingen ein, Wichser was, na komm Einzelkampf
Deine Freunde ficken, bis ich Chicko von der Leine lass
Schön, du bist vorbestraft, was für ein harter Mann
Trotzdem kackst du ab wenn du ein Tag von meinem Stress hast
Vorbelastet, von falschen Taten und Dingen
An Tagen wie diesen, die mich zu all dem Bösen zwingen
Zu tief drin bist du nur wenn du es willst
Lässt, du dich ficken, dann passiert es auch, dass man dich fickt

Some of the busiest rhymes ever made by man
Are goin' into this mic, written by this hand
Are comin' out of this mouth, made by this tongue
I'll tell you now my name, my name is Young
But so you think that it's your destiny
To get the best of me, but I suggest to be
Quiet, bro', don't even try it from the east and west of me
Takin' it and never breakin' it or even shakin' it
Groovin' it and always movin' it, 'cause I'm not fakin' it
Pullin' out rhymes like books off the shelf
Born in England, raised in Hollis, taught to go for myself
This is stone cold rhymin', no frills, no fluffs
And it's no accident that these rhymes sound tough
I'm goin' off, baby, there's no turnin' back
I'm on your TV, on your album, cassette and 8-track
And when the show is finally finished I'll be takin' my bow
My name is Young, and yo I got know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?

I got know-how
Party people, I got know...how
I kick it just like this...

Verse 2
-------

I got juice like the president, I'm makin' rappers hesitant
Invite me to your house and I'll be chillin' like a resident
Yes, 'cause I'm that type of man
'cause I make myself at home no matter where I am
I got it rollin' like thunder, makin' y'all wonder
Why I'm on top with all the other rappers under
I make no errors, mistakes or blunders
It's like a wedding, let no man put asunder
My name is Young MC, I like to rock mic well
'cause when I get up on the mic I just release my spell
It's no hocus-pocus, I'll just get you into focus
And swarm all over you just like a horde of locusts
Smooth operator, female persuader
Spot a fly girl and in a week I'm gonna date her
I got the kind of style for the here and the now
And I can do it 'cause I got know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?

I got know-how
Party people, I got know...how
Bust it!

Verse 3
-------

MC's I'll ruin, 'cause I know what I'm doin'
I'll treat 'em like doublemint gum and start chewin'
I spit 'em out when the flavour's gone
And I repeat the chewin' practice 'til the break of dawn
'cause I'm tough like a bone, sly like Stallone
Rockin' and clockin' on the microphone
Smooth like a mirror, in hearts I strike terror
Rhymes like runs and hits with no errors
Cold like a blizzard, on the mic I am the wizard
With the funky fresh rhymes comin' out of my gizzard
Never sneezin', never coughin', I rock the mic often
Hard as a rock and no sign I'll soften
Makin' sure I get respect, on my mind rhymes connect
I start to build like a builder from a architect
Movin' all around, above and under the ground
You see my face, and then you hear my sound
Comin' atcha with the mic in hand
I'm gonna take command just the way I planned
'cause I'm a one-man band and you are my fan
Don't you understand? I'm like Superman
Yeah, the Man of Steel, don't you know the deal?
You better be for real, I got sex appeal
This is what I feel, and this here's my vow
And now you know the brother with know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?

I got know-how...and I'm chillin', never illin'
In my mouth I got two fillin's...whatever!
I'm on the mic, cold stone gettin' over
My name is Young MC, known as the fly casanova, kick it...

Hexstatic,"It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

[Chorus]
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane!

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say ""You want some more?""
Livin' on a see-saw

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Til one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young so

Hey Marseilles,"Hold your map upright so the clouds and coast align
They’ve got old wars won, a bright brown sun, the crowds to sing alright
The lion’s share can rest as we sit in café lights
In a neighborhood where all that should may or may not be right

Make your way back home again. I am here still
These sideway streets are straight and true by strain and will
Make your way back home again at a slow pace
Promise me from sound to sea you’re mine always

Untimely make your way to the tarmac baggage claim
It’s all for naught if we forgot. I hope our hope’s the same
Sing praise to stars aligned. Rejoice that love is blind
To the end of days we’ll have to say you are the best I’ll find

We’ll give up on this town, the people who fill the air with their sound

I love you for your wit, not for the shit you spout in your dreams
Brace the ground and love you finally found in me or leave

Go along the beaten path
Where no one ever needs to ask
What separates this from the day before

Ocean waves are to die for
Endless blue and gray, endless

Lines we trace of a thousand ends
We'll count the ways we can't begin
Stay in our homes
Remain on our own

Lie everyone, says you should believe
That the map you draw shows the life you'll lead
Stay the course
And that world will be yours

Where the light is low, and the lake below
Calls my name to jump off it

Lies a lonely heart
That only ever pumps

Hey Monday,"Homecoming, I'm coming, my sweet mistake
Summer's over, hope it's not too late
I'm pacing, impatient, up in my head
Taken back to the sidewalk where we met
And carved out our names
Do you remember that?

I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Did you take off while I was gone?
I missed it all, I messed you up, I missed you
I'm coming home, I wanna know
When all the leaves begin to fall
If I'm falling, falling apart for you

Descending, I'm spinning, lost all defense
How could you swallow me again?
I left you, I meant to, couldn't let you in
Never mind a single word I said
Carve out your name
Do you remember that?

Did you take off while I was gone?
I missed it all, I messed you up, I missed you
I'm coming home, I wanna know

You've got control of me, is this the end of me?
'Cause I just can't cut up the strings
I'm coming back for more, don't let your heart go
Please don't walk away

Homecoming, I'm coming
I'm coming back

Sinking in the quicksand just to walk right up to you

If we run into red full speed
Then there isn't a blade beneath keen enough to pierce our skins

Hezekiah Walker & the Love Fellowship Crusade Choir,"(Verse 1)
The evening now in sight
I earnestly contend
To just stay grounded
With the absence of the light
The enemy moves in
And I am surrounded
With a weary heart
The battle goes on
Lord I will rest in the Words
That You spoke to me

(Chorus)
You are my Life
You are my Strength
My Faithful Defense and my Cover
My Shield and Shelter
Savior and Shepherd
You're my Life and my Strength
Jesus You Are

(Verse 2)
The warfare rages on
The toll it takes is that
My heart is tender
My spirit yet is strong
But as usual my flesh
Wants to surrender
Though it's hard to wait
On Your Word I'll depend
And believe with my heart
Until the end

(Repeat Chorus)

(Bridge)
In my distress
I called on You
And from Your throne
You heard me and saved me

(Vamp)
You are, You are, You are
You are, You are, You are
Oh, You are
Jesus You are
My Shield and Shelter
Savior and Shepherd
You're my life
Jesus You are

You are my Strength
You are my Life

Love is felt most when it's genuine
But I've had my share of love abused

We are troubled on every side, yet not in distressed
We are perplexed but not in despair
Persecuted but not forsaken
Cast down but we are never destroyed

And the conclusion of the whole matter is that finally the storm is over
It's time for us to reap what we have sown
No doubt my brothers and sisters
God has given us a miracle, finally, Black Street

Everything that I do, I owe it all to You, I bless Your name

I command every marriage to work out
I command every broken heart to be healed
I command prosperity upon my life

You, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a
Transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hide behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
La dee dah

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown!
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Laying in the green grass

Hi Tide,"I was tired of my lady, we'd been together too long.
Like a worn-out recording, of a favorite song.
So while she lay there sleeping, I read the paper in bed.
And in the personals column, there was this letter I read:

""If you like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
If you're not into yoga, if you have half-a-brain.
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape.
I'm the lady you've looked for, write to me, and escape.""

I didn't think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean.
But me and my old lady, had fallen into the same old dull routine.
So I wrote to the paper, took out a personal ad.
And though I'm nobody's poet, I thought it wasn't half-bad.

""Yes, I like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
I'm not much into health food, I am into champagne.
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon, and cut through all this red tape.
At a bar called O'Malley's, where we'll plan our escape.""

So I waited with high hopes, then she walked in the place.
I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face.
It was my own lovely lady, and she said, ""Oh, it's you.""
And we laughed for a moment, and I said, ""I never knew"".

""That you liked Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
And the feel of the ocean, and the taste of champagne.
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape.
You're the love that I've looked for, come with me, and escape.""

""If you like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
If you're not into yoga, if you have half-a-brain.

And spray the sheen so I get a Soul Glow
I play the corner tough
And me and Mase pull puffs on a blunt

Givin' high-five is what I want
So I puff a blunt, I don't front
I get spliffed, get a stiff
Then I go hump a stunt
Like a pimp pro
(Nah, man, a super ho)
That's cool 'cause I'm still an Afro bro
Yeah, I'm live for my life is hectic
Every hour, every minute, every second
I keep a level head and stay down to earth
'Cause I've been an Afro since birth

But I may, she flocks round me like a donut
She got sprinkles but I bite my way out

But the Native Tongue's thick
Lick 'em real good, like a real hood should
But the fly tape let the car speakers shake
I ran a cop down, I smile a frown with a but
Show gold teeth, 'cause I ain't a vegetarian
Not scared of beef, sport a feather like Chief
Got a scribble pad, you can get these gonads
'Cause I'm big-willed, blow off like a seal
'Cause connection with the Afro is real

I be the gift of gab, but be a bro with a diss
Because it's tough to bluff a cab
No wonder Melle Mel is 'Rrrr-RAH!'

Keeps his kids hooray, a size nine and half
I kicks my tricks, is to live for Island
I mug a mug vic, but I's cool, I self
With the quickness I bust the true slang
Show no pit to those who don't understand

I busted loose but now the blue goose is on my tail

In the closet with my silk, and below

And another crib in Queens
I munch some cornbread, Boar's Head
My favorite porck chops and
A plate of collar greens

All up in a girl I just released my beef
I keep huffin and puffin until I come
Yo bitch, give up the pussy and don't play (dumb)
For your body you know I been cravin
The last couple of weeks my lunch money I been savin
To get your ass in a motel
My dick is steady poundin and you're the scale
So weigh me, wait, I'm about to strip
Take off them clothes, so I can rip
That coochie, I know you want to give it to me
But hey hoe, don't try and do me
I'm cool and patiently I been waitin
Skanless stuck-up bitches, them's the ones I be hatin
And when it's time to get a dick-pack
They always come with that shitty act
(I'm sorry Hi-see, we can't go out tonight)
Fuck that shit, y'all make a nigga want to fight
So hey what's up, it's gon' be like that?
I ain't gon' ask you no more, I'm about to jack
Now take off your clothes and lay down flat
Cause that big fat pussy I got to crack
She took off her jeans, body lookin real pretty
I made a mistake when I asked to see the titties
She ripped off her bra, didn't have no fear
That shit was slappin, clappin, flappin like elephant ears
I said ""Damn"" they big as fuck
A little bit too big for Hi-see to suck
So I thought for a minute without makin a sound
It'd take at least ten minutes for me to wrestle 'em down
Threw back on her bra, tied it up in a knot
Slapped her on the padlock and said, ""Now let me see your cock""
She said, ""Ah-a, stop boy, that's enough, I quit""
Now how would you feel if I just slapped you, bitch?
I'm hittin harder than a bullet, my rhymes don't quit
I'm Hi-see, hoe, so stop poppin that bullshit

When I'm bullshittin, here's what I do
Roll up a fat joint, grab a 40 or two
Crack open a bottle and get to down that shit

Now when you bullshit you're not similar to Crawf
You're locked up in the bathroom jackin off
With a goddamn nasty book inside your hand

Like to lick on some titties or get they dick sucked

Threw on a beanie, 'bout 12:37
With thoughts on my mind of a 211
Threw on my fresh socks and my stomping boots
A brand new pair of brownies and my khaki suit
So I said to myself it's time to go jack
I grabbed a couple clips, loaded up the gat
I ran out the house, jumped in the Cutlass
Tired of bein broke, damn, fuck this
Hopped on the freeway lookin for the area
Showin no mercy and I'm not gonna spare ya
Searchin like a eagle but I ain't found shit
But just as the moment I was about to quit
Out jumps this Mustang doin 'bout 50
Driver bumpin sounds, he's rollin real swiftly
Now when I seen him I punched the gas
But I couldn't catch his ass cause he goin too fast
But hell yeah, I'ma get him tonight
I never wouldn'ta caught him but thanks to the red light
I'm in the left lane and he's on the right
Hey homeboy, you better check your taillights
Man, them muthafuckas don't work
He pulled over to the side like a stupid-ass jerk
He hopped out his car and walked to the back
Then I drew down with my gat, I said, ""Punk, this a jack
Empty your pockets and drop your keys""
His girl screamed out, ""Don't take his car, please""
I said, ""Bitch, get your ass out
You know what I'm about, I'll knock your ass out""
Grabbed her ass by the hair and drug her out the window
Pushed out the car while I fired up the Indo
So watch out, fool, don't let me catch ya slippin
I'll be another car that I'll just be strippin

They got to wavin, so I said fuck it
I ain't wavin back, they jumped in they bucket
Lookin in my mirror it's niggaz all on my ass
So I said to my girl I'ma have to blast
So I bust a turn on [Name] Street
Then I pulled a muthaufckin .357 out the seat
Them niggaz jumped out 12-gauge ( ? )
Give me the keys to your shit, or get shot in the rump
My girl got out first, they said (Ooh, look at that)
Not knowin my bitch had the big, big gat
I got out and just threw 'em the keys
Then my girl said (Don't take his car, please)
Looked at my girl and gave her the sign
The girl whipped out the gat and she blast three times
1 nigga laid dead
The other cocked back the gauge and shot her in the leg
""Don't shoot my girl,"" I begged and begged
But my girl shot again and blew his brains out his head

Nigga rollin through my hood with some big fat chains
Didn't know who he was, he musta lost his brain
He's ready to get beat and stomped on
A kid from Oakland tryina roll through Compton?
There's a bitch on the block named Sue
A hoe in the hood everybody been through
I didn't have to guess cause I already knew
That that's the fuckin house that he's gonna stop to
He was rollin a clean-ass Lac
On Daytons and 20s, a bumper kit in the back
I said damn, now who in the fuck is that?
He had diamonds on his hands and his chains was fat
He went in Sue house, I don't know what they was doin
But me knowiin Sue they was probably screwin
Now this nigga musta been on crack
So I rushed into my house, broke out the bumper jack
Stripped his shit and left it sittin on bricks
Fool-ass fag was in a hell of a fix
He was ready to leave the house
So I crept up to the door when I heard his big mouth
He kissed Sue and said good night
I threw my left hands on the chains, I bombed with the right
You know Sue, the stupid ass bitch
The hoe in the hood done turned into a snitch
Police pulled me over, I said what the fuck I do?
""I'm Crawf, officer, it wasn't me
""Shut up, nigger, don't they call you Hi-see?""
They turned they back, then I broke down the street
I almost got away till a K9 creeped
But it caught me and almost chewed my ass to death
I was almost dead, I had one thing left
Grabbed a 40 bottle, bust the dog in the head
Police stopped, check to see if he was dead
But by that time I was down the street
Sayin, ""Ha, you silly muthafuckas can't catch me""
So watch out, fool, don't let me catch ya slippin
I'll be another car that I'll just be strippin

[ VERSE 1: Hi-see ]
Boom, nigga, I'ma drop the rock
For the punk-ass niggaz that's on my jock
One day I was caught in the mix
In a gang, it was four, five or six
Old bitch-ass niggaz get to go head up
Cause when I run I tear they ass up
I got slung to the ground, took one to the eye
But a Compton-ass nigga won't cry
So I dusted off my clothes and I ran to the Cutlass
Thought for a minute, said fuck this
On the way back to Compton went to get the gat
But they knew that day I'd be comin back
But I didn't go back on the same day
Cause a nigga ain't stupid, okay?
But a month down the line they ass'll be mine
They be chewin on a muthafuckin AK

Once again Hi-see jumps on the scene
Killin all creeps if you know what I mean
Fool, so come on, bring your nine
But it ain't gon' help this time, punk

Take two to the eye, you won't stay alive
You keep poppin that gangsta mess
But you'll suck a gang of jock tryina fuck with the Skanless

Niggaz run up, get kicked in the balls
My weight may be light but I swing 'em like Mighty Mike

Your dick'll be sleep but his ass'll wake up
He'll fuck with your mind till you go and get her
Even if she got her big boyfriend with her
You'll step to the girl, thinkin you can clown
Touch her on the ass and her nigga beats you down

Nine o'clock in the morning, yes, I got dressed
Thought about my girl with the big fat breast
So I called her up and asked could I see her today
She said okay, so I said, ""I see ya Shante""
Hung up the phone, then I threw on my clothes
I pulled some tissue off the roll to blow the boogers out my nose
Put on my chain and my boots and things
Bout to step out the house and heard the telephone ring
I grabbed the telephone just to see what was up
She said, ""Gimme the place and time and we could hook up""
I said, ""Okay then, why don't you meet me in the park?
At a quarter to five, cause at six it get dark""
She said she didn't mind, okay it's on
So I grabbed my Skanless jacket, then I hung up the phone
I stepped out the house, smilin and grinnin
Sayin to myself, hot damn I'm winnin

Oh what shall I, what shall I, what shall I do

Oh what shall I, what shall I, what shall I do
Shall I slap the trick and tell the tramp it's through?

On the way to the park I had to stop at the sto'
When bums beg me for a quarter I usually say no
But that day I made all they butt holler
Went in my pocket, gave the poor fellas a dollar
They couldn't believe it, they had to ask me what's wrong
I said, ""Yo, just take this dollar and get yo butt on""
I bailed five or six blocks with a skip and a hop
Mmh... what's that smell? Oh, the flower shop
Now I pulled a lotta girlies out they panty hose
And never never have I ever bought a chick no rose
But that day I had to be the Life Saver
To top it all off, I rushed to 31 Flavors
The girl said she loved me, she said I was cute
But all I thought about was just knockin her boots
I thought about doin it with no hesitation
Now I'm sittin in the park just waitin

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Hi-see ]
Now I'm sittin on a bench with my back against the fence
Hi-see's not dumb, I got a gang of sense
Flowers in my hand, ice cream in a cup
I'm thinkiin to myself, won't this girl hurry up?
I seen my homies comin and my butt puckered up
They said, ""There go the homie Crawf, hey Hi-see, what's up?""
I grabbed the roses, tried to hide 'em behind my back
But I was stuck in a - ouch - caught in the act
Then a old man walked up to me
He said, ""You know, whatever will be, will be""
I said, ""Excuse me sir, I don't mean to be rude
( ? ) I'm in a bad mood""
He said, ""Look like you got yourself a few problems
Why me bein a old man, maybe I can solve em""

[Verse: Shade Sheist]
Yo, it ain't nothin' new (ain't nothin'), just a change in the name
Sheist done came and changed the game unexplained
Ways for days show you how to wait for your pay
Cause when Shade fuck up your sales, all your checks delay
And now niggas mad cause Shade can pull up in a Jag 
Hands free, chaperone all gettin' the door
And I ain't even interested in stealing your whore
So why these niggas actin like they want to marry the floor?
Like they ain't seen me breeze past all the gaurds at the door
Like I'm just wearin' this jacket to be hot
I flash the juice card, man this shit ain't hard
And It's the same thing at the same spot
What's my name?

[Chorus] (2x)
[Vocoder Box:]It's John Doe
[DJ Quik:] 4-5's spittin' up outta the
[Vocoder Box:]Four Door

[Vocoder Box:]Too slow {*gunshots*}
[DJ Quik:] What's the dilly?
[Vocoder Box:] Cause we kill for a living
[DJ Quik:] We kill for a livin'

[Verse: Shade Sheist] 
They want to know why I keep it so simple
I see that they just don't get it like my Nextel signal
Sheist on some other shit, Centinella gutter shit
Cards on the table, you can hit me or split 
And see now I fucked around and got Quik on the shit
So just imagine how many hips break when they dip
And all the excessive paper cuts from counting the grip
And how my legs hurt from humpin' back and forth in the whip
At only 35, coverage is a bitch on a six
And I ain't even got my first plaque yet (plaque yet)
Sheist, will still run circles over niggas who want it
And we ain't even gotta make the bets yet
Nigga what's my name?

[Chorus] (2x)

[Verse: Hi-C]
Throat-choke a hoe, Big Giggolo
Pimp the world, handcuff your hoe
Twurk your girl, when I step into the atmosphere
Niggas strapped wit fear, uh!
Is he is what I said he is and all
When I pimp bitches all dick and balls
Shade Sheist nothin' nice, new to the game
Get your money homie, bitch what's my name?

[Verse: AMG]
Hey-hey! we gon' hit these niggas where it hurt (uh)
Put the worm in your mouth like a perch (uh)
When I'm cum boo you gon' need a cert
Bust one, jump in the Monte Carlo and skirt (skirt!)
Give em naps, give 'em dap, then I holla holla back
""Hey nigga where you goin'?""
Boo I'm checkin' my traps
y'all niggas done shitted and stepped back in it
I'll fuck a nigga up all I need is five minutes.

[Verse: Swift]
Swift, and I pimp hoes like it's a gift
I got game so you know I'm ""The Answer"" like Allen I.
Got your whole style shook like 'Quilles or Kobe Bry'
While money multiply you haters ask why
No you can't stop the pimpin' the pimpin' is too fly
Runnin' game on yo wife while you out flossin' your ride
But she said, ""if you ain't busy, or close in the vicinity
Stop on by and come get the thighs.""

All you had to do is give Crawf a call
And watch me come through and get it crackin why'all
I'm still breakin bricks with the homey Quik
We try to get it down just as far as it gets
Cause all I have to do is hop back and spit
And watch all the lil' mommas start havin fits
When I slide through the city in my Escalade
I ain't worryin 'bout shit, cause we extra paid
Tryin to stay sharp as a razor blade
And you thinkin 'bout now that we got it made
And I'ma take you right down, that ain't the case
Ain't nuttin like mo' chips in my safe
Stop skinnin and grinnin all in my face

Or white as a egg minus all the yolk
On 20 inch spokes or flat out broke
We can do the thang loc cause why'all my folks

Break and shake shackles up off my feet
Po' out a little drank for the ones to see
Man I miss you Mausberg, homey rest in peace
I'm just down here goin through the day to day
Chasin pay, smash if you in my way
With 3 dimes and I'm lookin for a place to lay
Black Tone, where you at homey? (ANDELE!)
When we get a lil' drink we don't fight or fuss
But we do barbecue, slap bones and cuss
So let's get it get it hit it hit it ballin wild

I'm role model (role model?) I roll models in and out of my room

Now hit the light switch, and turn 'em back on
And take off them clothes so I can see if youse the type (ooh man)
Be a sad day in L.A. if I ain't ballin (yup)
Be no dubs spinnin, dudes drankin, broads callin (nope)
Cause I've been runnin up tabs since I was 19
And tryin to spend the rest of my life with the right team (who that?)
Me and Crawf Dog (Crawf) we been off why'all (off)
Off of 2 dime pieces and playin softball
They swallow golf balls (golf) they swallowed Crawf Dog (Crawf)
They swallowed me and that's why I see we been off why'all (off)
At the sports bar, drinkin Chopan and Mucal and Adios Mother
Give me another, cause I'm loaded
I dropped the bomb and her lil' drawers exploded
If you think we ain't mackin miss, you moldy

[Verse One]
Aw shit, come and show Crawf what you workin with
Booty bouncin with some big fat titties
Held up, I gots to hit this
Baby girl thicker than grandma grits

Jump in the lake and swim for that fish
Most of 'em mesmerized by my wrist
When I step in the club, blingin like this
While the bass pumpin the tweeters hits

Hit to the ear tryin to work my twist
Hey homey, watch this!
Hey hey, boo what's up wit'cho friend?
(I don't know, nigga what's up with some ends?)

What? Wait a minute, hold up
Told you before, I pays for no butt
I don't give a fuck if the pussy had platinum and gold in it
Don't pay to stick my pole in it

I'm cool with that
Don't want shit to do with that
I'm a throw you on the couch and make you scream ouch
When I hump and I pump yo' puddy cat

Stompin through the hood like Frankenstein

[Verse Two]
Most girls just want to be loved
By a ballin-ass nigga on dubs
To wine her and dine her and - give 'em hugs
To get they ass up out that club

When you slide up and down that pole
You got a brother like me on swoll
Upside down, fast and slow
You got my homies screamin ho

Let that monkey out of that cage
Got 'em all throwin dollars on the stage
Shake that ass and she get paid
How you think she bought that Escalade?

Ask the bitch you gotta man, she said no
Make my own dough, what I need one fo'?
All I want to do is see dollars on the flo'
I'm a do it like a +Destiny+ ho, ""Independent""

While I pull, press and bend it
I bounce, pushin 'em in it
She wobbled, twerkin spinnin
Aww shit, wait a minute

Look what you done to me
Girl you're a lil' too young for me
Boo don't mess around and let Crawf get one off
That's it, I'm goin to sleep, see ya

Wouldn't want to be ya, baby
Bend them blocks and, pay me
You know how many times, your boy done heard
What ya doin', that's my lady? Huh?

That's what she tellin' you, man ain't what she said to me
Boy your girl so cold she givin' out blows had me holla like Steve Harvey
Hey! Ho! Ah! Had to hit it with the whole damn thang
I'm a one man gang when I'm runnin train it's like bang, bang, bang

Did it so hard the apartment shook
Neighbors came by, I was scared to look
All is I know is them drawers got took
Quick, hit 'em with the hook - ah!

What ya thinkin' baby? Uh-uh, okay, what?
Yeah nigga I know, what you want
'Cause yeah nigga I've got, what you need
So proceed young boy, bring your toys

And if you don't do that, show me the cash
And if you don't do that I'ma give you the ass
The hottest oochie coochie

Even bitches want to do me, do me
I ain't lyin I'm qualified and pure
A freaky nasty lil' momma what'chu came in lookin fo'

And if that's what it is bring ya fine girlfriend

Then we turn it around, we gon' both do you

Had a curve on that ass like a brand new Bug
Skip the handshakes, why'on'cha give me a hug?
Her titties sat pretty like apple juice jugs

Wouldn't look me in my eye, I thought she was shy

And when my baby momma got to stressin me
She was my sexual therapy
Had a waist like a bass, her thighs like thunder
And her lips hot enough to suck the skin off a cucumber!
Made me wonder was she keepin it true?
Hey boo - how many niggaz you done done this to?
Keep it real, don't lie, you can tell me the truth
You've been trickin superchicken and I got proof

[Verse One - Rap]
As time passes, I flow with the swiftness G
Showin you all that are with this
continuous flavor, you all want to savor
And those without no clout will have to pay for this
DOPENESS, you ask who wrote this
(?? ??) and I do quote this
Rappers evaporate, flakes we eliminate
Create the great then I wait as I meditate
for those, who can't keep up with the dope rhyme
Huh, I waste no time
(??) they will come to return the life of some
So for now, I guess we're just too young

[Verse Two - Singing]
Go to school to listen to the teachers all day
to learn about the history of the U. S. of A.
I'd like to make a difference, starting today
but I'm not eighteen - Uncle Sam says, ""No way!""
All them rules are dying in the, worst way
We're getting (??) (??) working late
I want to save the planet, before it's too late
But the E.P.A. won't listen to what I have to say
Grown folks are talking, but never want to listen
My head is spinning as I try to get attention
They tell me don't worry, there's just nothing that I'm missing
When will they ever - as for my appearance, I'm too young
.. to make my own decisions, too young
.. to choose my own religion, I'm too young
.. to have my own opinion, too young
I'm too young

[Verse Three - Singing]
My daddy goes to work, almost ev-ery-day
He has to nine-to-five it so there's food on the plate
The boss is cutting corners and it shows on his face
And that's why, he'll reply - ""You're too young son, go out and play""
The city's filled with people with no, place to stay
Kids are pushing drugs to find a, better way
Babies having babies, and throwing them away
all because their parents, couldn't give them the time of day
Grown folks are talking, but never want to listen
My head is spinning as I try to get attention
They tell me don't worry, there's just nothing that I'm missing
When will they ever - as for my appearance, I'm too young
.. to make my own decisions, too young
.. to choose my own religion, I'm too young
.. to have my own opinion, too young
I'm too young

[Verse Four - Rap]
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Yo, I'm too young, to even try to get my point across
so why should I try, when I just feel
their eyes of deception, no need for correction
Just cause I'm underage there's no election
Chillll, I'm not with that program
My reading level's not ""Sam I Am""
I am a pro, and my brain is objective
So here my son, take some notes corrective
Adults only, is what they told me
So for some, huh, I guess I'm just too young

Something stinks here
Oh God! You are shitting on my bed

I don't want to clean up fuckin' dog shit
Again today I rubbed your nose in dog shit
I don't want to clean up fuckin' dog shit
Again today I rubbed your nose in dog shit

I'm playing a TV game
It's so exciting
I'm about to kill the biggest monster

Well, what is this noise?
What are you crunching
Oh God! It's a Hi-Standard CD!

Hi-Standard,"so you think I found the glory
yes but it's not what you think
let me tell you of the story
how life is a beautiful thing
are you ready to
start your journey
to places where
you've never been
life is fun if it's a journey
first you must
throw away the map
action is the only way
to find where you really are
and if you lose your way
look up to your guiding star
break out of your little world
stand up on your own feet
fall down get back up again
and I'm sure you will go far
I heard about a guy
who made a fortune
but was not happy
when you're driving
for your treasure
you have found the glory
action is the only way
to find where you really are

look up to your guiding star
break out of your little world
stand up on your own feet

I'm not afraid of anything 'long as you stay here by me

Hi-Tek,"What we have here
Is the alpha and the omega
I spit it
Bare witness to the greatest and the latest
They try to hate us

Witness the evolution of spitting, it's wicked and it's decadent
Revolutions per minutes, every time the record spin
Retribution for cynics, like a stick-up kid with weapons
In Brooklyn, they say I run it, the 'Natti is checking in
No matter the terminology, blood splatter artistically
It's looking like a Jackson Pollock painting, it's a mystery
Really should be brothers united against the industry
The Africans diaspora scatter at shattered history
The game missing me, rap is so repetitive
Although I ain't your blood or your cous', it's all relative
I got a gang of rhymes
And Tones' beats is banging
We moving through the streets like we're slanging dimes
It's magical, how the track is so classical
The cats who got gassed up in their sweats like Plaxico
I'm back from my sabbatical
Voice of the future, black radical
Keeping all the damages collateral

Listening to instrumentals
Thinking about all the things I've been through
The music is just a peek into my life, it's a window
It's so high tech and it's also simple
Even if I'm knocked down, I don't stay down
Even if I get down, I don't lay down
Hotter than the tar on this empty playground
Hotter than the tar on this empty playground

Hey yo, I'm taking all bets and settling all debts
A giant leap for man begins with a small step
From a sword to a set
To my people on the picket line
Who's sicking of getting treated like them aliens in District 9
I juxtapose my business model with my spirit
What, I'm just supposed to keep you comfortable with the lyrics?
I know the flow's disturbing
I know for certain just because you know all about the artist
Don't mean you know the person
You don't know me
I run labels
These unstable rappers is so phony
I try to listen but they're boring as missionary position
So I'm shitting on these niggas like dysentery conditions
I'm sitting on the throne, you dreaming that it's empty soon
Nobody feeling you, you're screaming in an empty room (Holla!)
The tree that fall in the forest, nobody hearing you
Even though you fall the hardest
Don't get me started

Yo, I built up my defenses
When I'm left to my devices, time gets suspended
More than DMX's driver's license
My music's steady, not affected by the higher prices
People having sex in the streets like Dionysus
You know what my advice is?
Fuck my advice, live your life
Stop tripping like everything amount to crisis
I make the sacrifices
My history is black as ice is
I don't think that I can trust you if you're lacking vices
I never miss a beat, the liquor make me slurred
It takes my words, tries to twist them like a Swisher Sweet
With sticky herb
American History X, your teeth'll hit the curb
It's easy 'cause I'm ill with the wordplay
I still flip the bird, like Jeezy
Strip it down, now it's exposed
I suppose my flow is the emperor's new clothes

What's happening to love? (It's that feeling you miss)
I'd like to know (it's that love, it's that passion)
(Tone, they don't get shit like this no more)

Welcome to my longitude and latitude
My attitude is shaping my surroundings
Skyscrapers, public housing
The sheep is running from the sun
The wolves is howling at the moon
It's tragic how you in the street
'Cause you ain't got no avenues
When it come to rapping, who's the baddest dude?
(In this world)
You still don't get it
This a recession--what recession?
Dog, we been stressing
Shit been a mess and we been dealing with this depression
Since way back, but you ain't got to say that
That's the greatest lesson
Slave to our possessions
Greed the devil favorite weapon
Fight to the death; only the greatest left

Let's get it

[Chorus]
Lordy, lordy, lordy, lord
I been hustling really, really hard
Get up off my ass, start making some moves
Put two and two together, start paying my dues
I got to get up for it, stand up
In this world

If skills sold, truth be told, I'd probably be, lyrically, Talib Kweli (Jay-Z)

I get respected by the best emcees
(In this world)
The recipe for my success is
One part pain and suffering
Two parts brains and hustling
Sprinkle it over Hi-Tek production
We bubbling like volcanic eruptions
You better buckle in
Push the panic button
Come get your mama to tuck you in
You know we did like no other did it
(In this world)
You gots to get with it

In this world
What's happening to love?
I'd like to know

[Chorus]

I grab the mic until my hands develop the calluses
My style is bit--I only see myself with John Malkovich
My grind miraculous, rhyme for slums to palaces
Facing all my challengers, raising the black-power fist
Here to eliminate the counterfeit
(In this world)
Add it up it--don't amount to shit
I paid my dues, kept the receipt for taxes
Although we stack it, we stay stuck in the bracket
It's like a straitjacket
My rebel tactics got the planet spinning off its axis
The devil laughing when you lazy; man, get off your ass and
Talent don't mean nothing without all the practice

[Chorus]",In This World,
Hi-Tek,"Yeah, you pronounce my name (Kweli), any questions?
I bring many blessings with my man Hi-Tek and he from the Natti (Natti)
We make the sky crack, feel the fly track
Get your hands up like a hijack
Fist in the air for (Kweli), keep 'em there like
Natural mystic or smoke when they spliffs lit
It's a revolutionary (party), they ask me what I'm writin for
I'm writin to show you what we fightin for
Say Taleeb or Talib (Kweli), if it's hard try spellin it phonetically
If not then just let it be like Nina Simone
You probably (ably) don't listen B
Even when we suffer losses I count the victories
Sometimes it's far and between I'm sad to say
It got my brain crowded like sunset on a Saturday
I know my son wept cause his dad's away
Stop cryin be strong for your momma is what I had to say

To my little man named Amani (mani)
Start the party, my crew hot feel these two shots
Like the blast from a double barrel shottie (shottie)

I remember when it all started
Back in the day when me and moms first parted
Hi-Tek from the beginnin I stayed advanced
A young chameleon, adapt to any circumstance
Peep game nigga never been a lazy nigga
Stayed on my hustle concentrate to get the paper bigger
Stay focused, while other cats stay hopeless
While niggas stay high I stay lower
Stacking my chips to get a foreclosure
This shit ain't over
Going for the gusto, keep getting that provo
It's Hi-Tek (and Kweli) on the track like Flo Jo
Bet you ain't even know I had flow though

Yo, make you rock your body (body)

[Verse One]
Free the rhyme or risk a dig into a deep sound abyss
Unit in the stash the beats and never found the shit
Experience like Hendrix, keep my sound enriched
Cats ask about my stitch, to me they soundin bitch
In my sounds the glitch of hatred, for cats who ain't make it
I'ma give it, as far as you can take it
Tried to take the safe way, told you there's a gateway to skinny
Many can find it but few can climb it
I'm open-minded like a pothead
Doin what I gotta do to keep the spot fed
In the climate, of locked dreads, corn-rows, torn souls
Worn hoes, who been molested by they uncle
I bundle, amongst you cold mother-uckers
The world is bitter, like baby mothers
Look how far El Dorados and wine bottles drug us
Least God and the sun love us, it's the Sun God

[Verse Two]
Everywhere is broken glass
Nephews smokin squares, nieces smokin grass
Try not to say shoot around my daughter she already know to blast
Catchin the future, don't know who threw the past
It's the, year of the snake and the hidden dragon
Niggaz is fake like bitches braggin
Listen to the ocean and the stars, keep my vision in motion
In motion like cars
I'm down to Earth, at times I feel closer to Mars
The world is yours, I'm hopin it's ours
Some say the Gods is crazy, I see God in our babies
Child of the sun, I allowed it to raise me
(.. from a distance) niggaz tried to appraise me
I'm hard to read like graffiti so it don't phase me
My days be spent, behind dream's tent
Through the sun the divine being is sent
It's the Sun God

[Verse Three]
Letters from prison sayin we need a better religion
I'm a rebel that listens from a eighty-seven position
I can't crystallize the mission lies within
Born to die even in death we begin
It's heavy 'jo learnin what we already know
and carry low swing on a chariot slow
Brothers stick though remindin me of revolution
If the drama comes I'ma have to uhh pop his gun

As time fleets don’t tire your hands in mine

So drop into this, so drop into this
So drop into this or I’ll be swinging it solo
So drop into this, honey help me swim right through this
So drop into this or I'll be swinging it solo",Shaolin Monk Motherfunk,2015
Hiatus Kaiyote,"Aftermath of the catch
Reeling in the secrets of the swamp
A motorcade harrowed and dapper underneath the surface
Founded, its talons curl they come to get you boy
Howling like

A toothless grinned swamp thing
Is lurking, come get you
Is lusting for your skin
Its hunger is climbing

A willow wisp, a rum soaked ritual
Ravenous its cold stare is habitual
Send a message with fire smouldering across the lily pad
Saffron tears the sweetest you’ve ever had

A toothless grinned swamp thing
Is lurking come get you
Come close dear, I could hold you
Safe in the water where the pressure
Crush you like pestle and mortar
Kiss your fever sleep forever

Forever
To sleep, to sleep
Forever",Swamp Thing,2015
Hic,"(Hey man, don't you realize
In order for us to make this thing work, man
We've got to get rid of the pimps, and the pushers, and the prostitutes?)

Yes, yes, y'all

Ah, ah
That's funky

Yeah
Hey yo, Marley, man

Yo, what's up, man?

Hey yo, man
You know
We was getting busy on the album everyday
We been getting funky, but
I wanna take this jam back to Farmers
Know I'm saying?

Yo, let's go back on Farmers
And get some of them early MC's
You used to be kicking it with back in the day?

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yo, let's do a jam with them

Alright, bet
But first I gotta like introduce it
You know'm sayin?

Aight, kick it

(Farmers Boulevard)

Back in the days, before I was Cool J
I used to hang up on the corner, pumpin' Games People Play
Sittin' on a garbage can, rhymin' to my man
Talkin' bout big money and future plans
I always told the brothers, if I got a contract
When the money started flowin', I'd be back
To do a jam, against all odds
Introducing rapper 1 from Farmers Boulevard

Hey yo, B-o-m-b, bomb explosion
Attack like a cat when I'm trapped and I'm closed in
Sharp-ass claws, and I break all laws
In a while all jaws, cause I'm perfect, no flaws
Now I'm back to Farmers on some new improved
I'm makin' moves, not fakin' moves
So don't you never come around here, talkin' that talk
Or walkin' that walk, you'll get played like a sport
Football, soccer, whatever you savor
You're a tramp and a pussycat, ready for labor
Ha! I'll have you breakin locks
I'll have you cookin fried rice in a big steel box
The type of skills that I got reigned for years
No worry or cares, your crew'll shed tears
'Hip-hip-hooray, he's back!' Yo, save the cheers
Suckers, I'm drinkin' forties of beers
On the Boulevard

Funky, funky, funky rhymes bein said here

Hey yo, hey yo
Hey yo Uncle L, let's go

Yeah man, I wanna check out my man Big Money Grip
Yo, what's up, man
Kick a little something

Kick out the can and slam
Summertime, C.I.A. step into the jam
Reach for the mic, and the punks start to fold up
And the brothers start fleeing like it's a hold-up
Some step aside, but a few play me close
Never worry, cause the brother who cross me's getting buried
And the fool who wants to deal with another dose
I see to it in a hour that the mother is comatose
Farmers Boulevard, the place
Handing me a mic is like giving a chainsaw to Leather face
Smoking MC's in an instant
At my side busting caps is T-Boogie, my assistant
Throw that speaker in the trash
Why's that? Cause Gangster Boogie gave the woofer a gash
Big Money Grip making you get up
Farmers Crew's in effect, we never heard of a head-up

Yo, yo, yo
It's kinda funky out here on the boulevard, yo

Yeah, we living Chinese people in a Turkish bath, baby

Hi C over there, man

Yo, what's up Hi C

Hi C on the scene, at last to bust a funky rhyme
More than a line on time, because I'm gettin mine
Never underestimate the skill of a great one
The Boulevard Lord, shorts, never take none
Another funky rapper from around the way
Leaving bodies at a party, cause somebody gotta pay
Boy, you been told, put your lips on hold
All you remember is a barrel and a mouth full of gold
Spreading terror on the street like they was in the past
Any punks on the block, yo, never could last
And I never feel sorry for a sucker I gained on
Any slick talker, yo, he's bound to get rained on
At any Farmers party at my side is a Mag
(One time a sucker got ill and went out in a body bag)
Fear will erupt through the heart of another
The Farmers Crew will never fall, that's word to the mother

Yo, yo
It's kinda funky out here
Yo, yo, yo, Hi C
Yo man, y'all kinda funky out here, yo
I was,
Yo, what's up?

9 years ago, man
Youknowmsayin?

Farmers Boulevard, baby

Yo, I was kinda,
I was kinda stagnant to sleep on it
But yo, L
Won't you, won't you sum it all up for the people, aight?

Aight, let me sum this up

Now you heard the brothers speaking bout the street that we're from
Rhymes hitting, beats kicking, you can't get none
F-a-r-m-e-r-s passing the test
Marley Marl in the background doing the rest
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, do-ti-la-so-fa-mi-re-do, kato
Get up out my face before I play you like Play-Doh
I did a jam against all odds
And it was dedicated to Farmers Boulevard

Keep on

To the beat, y'all
A funky beat, y'all

I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,

Why did I leave her alone tonight?

There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.

She dances while his father plays guitar

I wish I was beautiful
So come dance this silence down through the morning 
Cut Maria! Show me some of them Spanish dances
Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones

Grey is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

When everybody loves you, son, that's just about as funky as you can be

When I look at the television, I want to see me staring right back at me

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

Hideko Hamano,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1995

Crackin it open hopin to make a dent; I'm hell-bent on
resurrection, per-fection
Lesson #1: rekindle the essence
Rap ain't about bustin caps and fuckin bitches
It's about fluency with rhymin ingenuity
All of this is new to me, see I peep rhymes
with scrutiny, under a microscope I walk a tightrope
A thin line between insanity and sanity
mixed with a little vanity, boostin the morality
with Hiero hospitality, soon to strike it rich
like calories, salaries, ahh sounds like a plan
And, I will expand hip-hop as well
Might even kick a little impromptu, to stomp you
weaklings, speaking things foreign to the human ear
that, you will fear now, whether you like it or not
Blood clots on your little life on the situation
and on the stipulations... the shit you wastin
time on you pawns, it was planned like that

Just hoe slap and bustin caps is your message
Plus every time I put some scrill down, you steal it
If that's your way of teachin me a lesson I don't feel it
Your raps reflect your life and that's a shame
cause the way you're soundin, you must think that it's a game
I can see if you came from the ghetto, but you came
from the Meadow -- you really need to let that go
You got no respect for hip-hop, and you tryin to rhyme
Biding your time and I find it a crime
I even tried to bury the hatchet man
Cause we all African, you want to be a rapper
start practicin, you can't even flow right
Spend most of your time fuckin hoes, getting in fights
Hangin out, with no mission in life
And you're missing your life, and you'll be missing out on life

Fightin in a circle, we workin the mic 2 deep
Pass that mothafucka so I can sink my teeth in
Center myself, then I walk through the flames

No stranger to the danger room I'm into

So the thoughts came interlaced with the taste of victory
I'm slippery, rippin these niggaz apart
From start to finish...and it don't stop (Keep on)

I'm the only individual not capable of having a prime-time
Can't capture this rapper from this present day backwoods
To the depths of antiquity no one can get with me
I used to battle Socrates rockin these same styles
Inventor of math and science, holdin my style
Showin defiance to the gangsta jargon you barkin
Metaphysically sparkin in psyche when mic's in my face

My broken language slay niggas that came this way
Aimlessly
My automatic's spray reck havoc and mayhem

And get it off your chest

It could be fatal wait'll Del come back out
And act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait'll O come back out, and act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts

Hurrah, here come Del to dispel the blahs
Cause and effect, pause for respect collection
Diction friction, depicting violence
Volatile with my profile, like Molotov's
MC's must be on auto-pilot, waddle silent
Like some platypuses, Del is down with data pushers
With top secret floppy disk and battle armor and mega
Plus all the rhymes that I'm bangin are double-decker, to check ya

Electri-fying, defying laws of gravity (what?)
Avidly rapidly firing lyrics I'm shattering
The abdominal cavity, then I'm travelling out the spinal
Finalizing your paralysis on the microphone (what?)
The catalyst is the capital L-I-N-D-S-E-why
MC's try to test but they mind gets blown

Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait'll Del come back out, and act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait'll O come back out, and act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts

Ain't no MC hurtin me, matter of fact you work for me
Havoc stricken palladiums made me numb
To anything you speak to desecrate the great Hieroglyphics
And with it goes the flows that chop egos, to segments
Behind the decimal points, I point backwards
When you lack words you toil but boil I coil clowns
All around, repellin sellin statues of wack groups
Statues for Hieroglyphic travellers
Any lackluster MC's I mallux ya, right on your cranium crack it
Bust your teeth through your limbs and then tip you over
If you know of Del, well then
I ill constantly with consonants, followed by nouns and make
Mounds of manuscripts to whip challengers, that ain't
Too talented, so before I reach my destintation
Let's waste some MC's for fun (yeah)
I understand the fans needs so I feed em smorgasboards
So they can gorge and MC's can gouge they eyes out, from the teargas
Emitted from my tongue, leaving fans sprung
And for the crews who high-strung, eat dung (ewww)
They just gnats and ticks, bugging me (bzzzzzzz)
Hugging me nuts in a cuddly clutch, my
Hieroglyphic theory is validated by facts
Dilated the tracks, so they wide and fat
Violated the wax, but colonized the wise words
With more enzymes ten times nutritional
Unintentional, my flows just go there, yeah

Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait'll Op come back out and act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait'll Del come back out and act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal wait'll Souls come back out
And act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal wait'll ? come back out
And act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
It could be fatal... wait'll Cas come back out
Time to scam all you MC's
Yeah, yeah, it could be fatal
Wait'll Pep and Jay-Biz come back out, hahaha

Just wait

""My rhyme will remain Hieroglyphic""",Oakland Blackouts,1998
Hieroglyphics,"Whooh! yeah
It's the ones you know about
The famous, magnificent hieroglyphics, mega
Always on the mic for mc's who really don't know what we doin'
It's time to do it up
We got cas, we got del, we got tajai, we got a-plus
See'mon y'all, please can we get busy?

I put my pencil to the paper and watch lighting strike
Casual, the innovator, in a state of advancement
MC scolder, breakdancin' on the lake
When it freeze over so much game, I told her
I'm a disease holder and I still hit it
Bust a nut in her eye and made her deal with it
The straight bump, y'all, yeah you best agree
Whatever that sess do don't let you come next to me
Mentally, I'm compatible with Macintosh
And I can get a niggaz' bitch, in the sack with floss
Hop on the microphone, actin lost
Unaware, unprepared, then I bust off the top
And niggas get scared

Uh, now I told y'all I wasn't playin'
It's hieroglyphics in here
Now that's cas, now you know that's how it was, that's how it is
We bout to do it with my next man, a-plus

A to the, plus must do ya, bust through ya
Defenses with lyrics mentally muscular
Holdin' down like cement shoes, to make you drown right
This is what we do if we the crew you sound like
I can't stand a person bitin' someone's creativity
I have so many styles that you can take one as a gift from me
It's like deja vu whenever you pop they tape in
Lyin' more than satan, fallin' off like they was ice skatin'
Trying to get they mic taken, you get scolded
And chastized, my holy mic, is baptized
Givin flatlines to you rap guys and still send you
Back with black eyes, on the mic you tellin' fat lies

Now if I'm the teacher
I gotta give that a a-plus you kno what I'm sayin'?
Now let's make room for the man, the myth
The great great granddaddy of hieroglyphics, del

Hold up, stop the presses, this just came in
Del's done it again, you gotta get his name in
He's, infallible in battle flows and battle royals collects
All the spoils of soiled celebrities
Shape my fantasy as the form, lyrical oddessey
It's not modesty, I show my ass for all to see
Polishin wax with facts sharp like tacks
To stop your, heart like cracks rip, apart the tracks
Ah

Now you know that's self explanatory
Now we bout to get busy with my man tajai
Break out your notebooks and your pads
Listen real closely to what this brother has to say

I kick the, like dialect
It's sacrilege, steppin' in the sanctuary of the sacrosanct
Do not, desecrate acquiesce
Before I dessicate all your flows and leave you dry as, bones
It's awful how I decimate, but also awesome
People say that they saw somethin' they cherished they lives long
When I expectorate upon a song
To be honest number one's what I expect to rank
Not for just the crown jewels or scepter
Out for justice, and exposition of the rest as jesters
With they lackluster compositions
Suckers in estrus, thinkin' that hieroglyphics won't fuck you?

Oh my goodness, I told ya
Once again, it's hieroglyphics
We got the smooth lineup, tajai, a-plus, del, casual
They just to' it up, forget about it, leave it alone
It's hieroglyphics from here on out
You don't know what you're doin'
And me, I'm the extra prolific, whiz kid
y'all can't mess with this, leave it alone
Drop ya pen, it's time that we go on
Let us alone y'all, can't fade this
You know how we do it",Off the Record,1998

[Casual]
All they seen was one hand bust through the white sand
Illuminating the land with liberation
And mysterious, ferociously, serious black man
Experience the urban warfare of fully strapped assault
As an angel hoping my benevolence will change you
Singing folklore of the poor
Natural born warrior
Since the days of Spain was ruled my the Moors
Then again, before your existence
Imhotep
The presenter of the mystics
Geometry, trigonometry statistics
It's simplitics embedded in my bloodline
Just like the pain of my forefathers
The chains of slavery remains
Behaviors we obtained in days that we were slained and tortured
Tormented and scorned
Shackles on my feet, feeding me pork
Lashes on my back, lost my family
Not to belittle the middle passage calamity
I gotta make decisions
Cause I keep havin' visions of flight bombing politicians
On some midnight marauder missions
It gets harder
They shut down your energy, cut off your water
Close the gas station, food supply shortened
Dying of starvation and smoke ventilation
I'm coming realer than you fairytale killers
We disciplined, that's why no militias can get with us
Sure, shot hit us from a thousand meters away
All day

[Del]
Tomorrow, what you gonna do?
Your past is haunting you
You know what, I'ma tell as I'm sipping on this brew
You know it's wrong and true
So what you gonna do?
The truth is long overdue 2X

[Tajai]
I'm talking bout
Demolitions, ammunition
No more propositions or petitions
Seditions met with lynchings and whippings
But they won't crush my wishes into submission
Foresight courtesy of 3rd Eye Vision
Tells me hit 'em
Get 'em before they first force strike
Meet in the black of the night
Dodging ghetto pterodactyl lights
Bring the full gats and precious metals if you true dat
Get wise with medical supplies
Conceptualize and plan
Or get caught with your ass wide open
And not get to ask
""Why"", I'm hoping you hear
And I'm hoping your here
For the millennium season opener
I keep ample degrees up my sleeve
For brothers who no longer breathe
No reprieves
Nothing but memories to retrieve
Black babies disease
Stomachs distended, arms out stretched
For any care extended
This is the flock to which I am attended
But I'll do it
I'm committed, commending
All commandants vowing to be uncommon
Fuck the promenade
Underground and granite-strong, granted
The path is jagged and long
And we look raggied
But I want more than this wall at my back in days
Back we would have been mobile
It's time to make power moves
And put the all in all-powerful, all in all
I can't close my eyes
And I would be a coward too
And so would you, so sir
Are yor scared?, no sir
I see answers to irradiate
Eradicate this cancer
They won't catch me playing patty cake with hands up
You might catch me spraying
But I think you better get them flight masks up

We the ones that make you feel right 
You need to open up your eyes and see delight 

[Opio] 

I'm at ease when I'm next to my keys 
Not the narcotic 
The Ensoniq ASR-X is my symphonic weapon
Stepping to these creations is like attempting to scale the Appalachian 
Mountains 
It's damn near impossible 
Without rigid preparation and lots of pull 
Delight 
Profound lyrics spit into mics 
Irresistible to bite on stage 
The instrumental incites the freestyle 
Fake MC's bust written raps 
Pupils dilatin 
Agonizing forgetting raps 
While I'm shining intensely 
Reflecting off the Hieroglyphic shield 
For real 
Reinventing hip hop 

[Pep Love] 

Open up your eyes and see delight [delight fades] 
You better open up your eyes and see delight [delight fades] 

[Pep Love] 

It go, Cancer the crab is my zodiac sign 
F.L. is the crew, I'ma let my light shine 
We multi-faceted, feel good pharmacist at this 
Now listen to the lyricist cease 
And desist so we can leave em deceased
If not stressed till they suicidial 
I ingest the mic 
Just a test of sound 
If I impressed, see delight on my face 
In the place of mess 
First Light 
The recipe for Saucee, serves you right 
You can ask Martini and Rossi 
You don't want to grapple with that bullshit 
I'll pull a rabbit out my hat if I wanted trick 

[Pep Love] 

Open up your eyes and see delight [delight fades] 
You better open up your eyes and see delight [delight fades] 

[Opio] 

What are you doing? 
You're confused like a hermaphrodite 
Rapping like this one or that one won't get you capped at night 
Or shanked in the morning sun 
At the venue 
If you continue to disregard these warnings 

[Pep Love] 

Running into some problems 
Mic to mic, you must resuscitate 
Life in your mental state 
Trife when we infiltrate 
Tonight the light is felt 

[Opio] 

Like encountering an asteroid belt 
You gets pelted, welted up 
Face is green like a Celtic or Wimbly stadium 
Center court 
No back support 
You just a gelatin skeleton 
Lyric like a elephant tranquilizer 
Impeding your development 

[Pep Love] 

I'm runnin amuck, dumb fucks
And gunning 'em up 
They awe-struck by the light like deer
Game for the hunter, predator 
Ready to taste blood 
So blaze up a blunt and pass that shit here 

[Opio] 

Yeah, they need light like photosynthesis 
Biting sentences 
Witness to thee inventiveness 
That you can't resist 
Painful like a pistol whipping 

[Pep Love] 

Niggas is tripping they get dissed 
I mind my business which is this 
Ripping microphones 
Scratching suckers off my list 
With speed 
A level that you can't exceed 
I give the people what they want 
You need to take heed

Verse 1

Tonight we got the mic on cruise
With more luck than horseshoes
While we fuse together like ??
'Cause we move with ten ton thrusters
The cosmopolitan cosmonaut up in your knot again like aneurysms
Expand with wisdom
Musical mannerisms are parallel to cannibalism
And animal instinct that's in sync
Distinct, leavin' suckas extinct when we combine
The gravity hella fine, physics of mind
Inebriating, leave you gaping open
Nothing's safe in Oakland
It's potent and murder is the slogan but
We showin' you the erosion of the stereotypical
Itchin' to pull the trigger on niggas
This is all original
And brand new, fidgetin' with tracks that are rigid and
Pigeonholin rappers while collectin' dividends at the door
Ya' know [ECHOES]
And that's how it goes

CHORUS

Who? Who? Who? Who?
Who the entertainers stompin' through like cross-trainers?
Can't be no plainer
YOU!
The remainders couldn't never be that one
Pack em in by millions attendance is platinum

Who? Who? Who? Who?
Who the innovators who stimulate like vibrators
With rhymes so major
YOU!
Ya' need us to rock a show, hit the pager
Niggas catch vapors when our lyrics hit the paper

Verse 2

Once again in your dimension, tension personified
Del and Hieroglyphics pollenize
We don't apolgize for gettin' places packed back-to-back
Our rank cranks just about any function
While your memory file is blank
No hankey-pankey jankey stuff goin'
Down over here no forms of raps eroding
My styles fluctuate like the Dow Jones average
While they stay savage
My cassette change shape and transform like ravage or rumble
Make the earth crumble and separate
Fallin' to the underground
Get into your head like a metal plate
While you sit and wait for these niggas on TV, they hella fake
Hieroglyphics, they can never escape us
The eagle eye, Mach 1, three mics
Yes indeed, intuition is the tool in which I use 
When enrichin' you with original stylistics
And the Hieroglyphic ritual is too habitually blowin up
With ballistic attacks
Let me just deal with the facts
Niggas keep it real in they raps which are not realistic
Perfection and our poetical competitive edge
Is just a reflection of how we feel shit
This history's impressionist microphone specialist 
Catchin' bids for puttin' MCs parts in my fridge
But granted quiz it to exquisite to the highest EO
My prodigal product a diabolical melodics
Aquatic is nautical
Motion, Hiero, kenetic flotation so fuck ya phony radio rotation
My colossal might on the mic is optimum
Hip-hop from the Sequoia Heights populous
Gamma rays like Bruce Banner
Phase your scanner
With mind over matter I slap the curls out you girl scouts....ya know

Who? Who? Who? Who?
Are these originators rippin' cuts like sabres
In the hands of Darth Vader

Life is a blast when you know what you're doin'
Best to know what you're doin' 'fore your life get ruined
Life is a thrill when your skill is developed
If you ain't got a skill or trade, then shut the hell up

My rhymes is like droppin your head on cement
Crackin it open hopin to make a dent; I'm hell-bent on
resurrection, per-fection
Lesson #1: rekindle the essence
Rap ain't about bustin caps and fuckin bitches
It's about fluency with rhymin ingenuity
All of this is new to me, see I peep rhymes
with scrutiny, under a microscope I walk a tightrope
A thin line between insanity and sanity
mixed with a little vanity, boostin the morality
with Hiero hospitality, soon to strike it rich
like calories, salaries, ahh sounds like a plan
And, I will expand hip-hop as well
Might even kick a little impromptu, to stomp you
weaklings, speaking things foreign to the human ear
that, you will fear now, whether you like it or not
Blood clots on your little life on the situation
and on the stipulations... the shit you wastin
time on you pawns, it was planned like that
But we can fight back, like David Horowitz
and say we want no more of this
and put it in a cyrogenic status
Replace it with the latest in technology
Hip-Hop policies that demolish ya follies
Olly olly oxen free, get off of me
You can't see this, your defeatist attitude'll
get you nowhere fast, I tend to my task cause

Life is a blast when you know what you're doin'

Best to know what you're doin' 'fore your life get ruined
Life is a thrill when your skill is developed
If you ain't got a skill or trade, then shut the hell up

Don't even start on the next man, let's scan
your situation, you still have no patience
Flip on niggaz, rob niggaz, even family
All the way up to your moms -- you can't stand to be
in the house, but when you kicked out you beggin
to come back in then the same old skit happens
You say you rappin but you don't know the essence
Just hoe slap and bustin caps is your message
Plus every time I put some scrill down, you steal it
If that's your way of teachin me a lesson I don't feel it
Your raps reflect your life and that's a shame
cause the way you're soundin, you must think that it's a game
I can see if you came from the ghetto, but you came
from the Meadow -- you really need to let that go
You got no respect for hip-hop, and you tryin to rhyme
Biding your time and I find it a crime
I even tried to bury the hatchet man
Cause we all African, you want to be a rapper
start practicin, you can't even flow right
Spend most of your time fuckin hoes, getting in fights
Hangin out, with no mission in life
And you're missing your life, and you'll be missing out on life
I won't sweat you for that G you stole
cause if you're still alive, I'll be there to see you fold
Told ya!

Best to know what you're doin' 'fore your life get ruined
Life is a thrill when your skill is developed
If you ain't got a skill or trade, then shut the hell up

You could be a rapper an actor a gun clapper
A comedian providing laughter as a bachelor
A pastor of a chapter, a doctor, a lawyer
A fireman, a hired hand, whether boy or girl
it's your world your future you control it
Whatever you do, early on, is how you mold it
I record it, sold it, told it to you
Mr. Del wouldn't tell you nothin that ain't true, because

Life is a blast when you know what you're doin'
Best to know what you're doin' 'fore your life get ruined

You're making some green
But not for glamour or fashion
I'm stacking cash until I can get moms a mansion
All from rapping?
Nah, man, there's many plans
Like investing in land
It started all from impressing the fans
With brand-new flows

All the way from gangsta clones to weirdos
Fools used those
But we ain't tripping
Give respect when you see this
You need us

From ninety-three 'till infinity, we've been inventive
Creating the bump is our only incentive
And it's been a long time since I feel I've been felt

So you know what we gots to do
Maybe could we keep it within the crew

Utterly hovering over other things material

Or earthbound, heatin' up the Coliseum

They rushed the stage full-throttle in Chicago
Our brains interlocked
Where fakin' emcees get caught with the forty-bottle
Or get their chains snatched, pronto

Maneuverin' through Vancouver and on to Japan

I stick a machete in the back of
Your engaged, trying to disengage the blade just to save
Your life, caught a knife, back stabbed again
Jealous, want your cabbaging, yelling out
How I break out the mack ten, fully automatic then
start spraying up shop like the crooked cops
squeezing the trigger like Ice T
It's magical, how the shiesty ones gradually metamorphosis
Right before your eyes and then flash on 'em

I get cold sweat, every morning
Waking up from nightmares, about heaven being
This padded room, that god send, I'm never leaving
I wonder if I'm dead or breathing, I think he's punishing me
'cause I think people look better bleeding
I praise, for Prozac and Codeine
To keep my mind floating, hoping I don't hurt somebody for nothing
I praise, I remember brighter days,before I was abducted by the grace
And now my mind's a maze, understand

I be strong in the Berkeley streets
Searching for meat and trashcans with assorted leftovers
A face for closure, the home of mind roams is known
Amazes, thinking about the days I rhymed( I could of made it )
I can't accept panic swept, I'm an arsonist
Leaving the Oakland hills, smoke filled, I'm deadlier than arson it
Down at lake Merritt, setting ducks on fire, watch the fluttering flab
I'm on the run, fuck the priors

Five hands is better than one
Instead of just won, when you see me you better run
They try to say that I'm crazy, but I'm normal
y'all crazy

They say I'm bonafied, infantile talented
Not commended enough to be committed, but in balance
I lost my parents as a kid
Nobody's really certain if their deaths were an accident
That gets me laughing, you're all just victims for the assassin
Using drugs is suppressive, but I can't surpass 'em
The killa cats are catching, I want to see the whole world in ashes
Only then will I be happy

They got my attitude switching, conditions my brain
Moving fast and I'm twitching of this prescription drug, eviction
Trying to maintain the same
But everything 's against the grain
So it don't make sense to complain
I'm convinced that my brain is tensed from this strain of stress
Wanderin 'your town, with intense of pain, and yes
I like to do things until my mood swings
I'm like fuck that, y'all niggaz is strange!

Go to the city

Now this is how it is
We try to handle biz
And make moves in this land where the power lives
Where they devour kids
And acts of cowardice rule from a tool of violence and a
Shrouded bliss
I try to release my malice
And develop my inner peace in a place so callous
Maybe I'll go to Angle or other Gold Coast
And blow smoke with the old folks cause they know most

Capture the cultured pearls, jewels, and gems
It's a treasure hunt to stimulate your medulla stem
The furthest reaches are within your clutches
Concrete covered countries to the most birded regions
Virgin territories, those exposed to man made woes
They know them Hieros
Electrified with lectures, collect respect and ride on
Before you even know this I'm gone (No)
Go to Saigon, Singapore, Sicily
They consider me epitome in Italy (That's right)
Hit Libya, India, Morocco
Or go to Oakland and hit the eight deuce block dough

To hold nothing
I mean bluffing
I got the poker face
I don't really know my place
And I never chose this way
So I go astray
Throw aways blow away
Every hope I hold today
We were sold as slaves
The sky is cold and grey
My niggas showed the way
So fan and listen now with this
I see my golden age

Unhh
Times on travellin'
Boundary crossin'
Now we talkin'
Worldwide, now we cost em'
Fo' sho' partner I'm a globetrotter
Downing shots of gold slaga'
Smokin' like a 'O' roster
I've flown lots of places in a Continental
Every spot we've been to
We monumental
We rock the venue like we dropped a missile
But it ain't an attack
That's why the people keep on bringing us back, feel that

(One, two, three)
I didn't tap a belly
Still I'm lovin' Machiavelli
Trying to reach the pinnacle
And we will, so be ready
Said we jetty
I've never stolen energy
Combined with visionary minds so we itchin' to blow
Like a Dirty Harry trigger finger
With a needle quicker than my Pilipino homies on the two
Turntables
See the truth enables sight through your damaged cornea
We got the formula from Oakland California

Hieroglyphics," 
Think, think, think
You think about it

Think, think, think
You think about it

Watch this ??? radiation from the flamin' hot sun
Known as Hieroglyphics
The light intensity is blazing
Collapse into an angel dust fit
From the dope I spit
Cocaine to your brain
You sick chasin' a dragon
Hollow-tips disintegrate
When I infiltrate your temples with these rap magnetics
Depleting the iron in your hemoglobin
Freeze burnin' a slack apathetic
Who fiendin' for the spotlight
While you plot on me
I write these older soliloquies
You can't see
Your corneas are straight sizzling
Riddling your shell with holes from the shit I bring
Catch you with the black adder poison just for mentioning Hiero fool
You got it twisted like King James
Perversion Persian Gulf syndrome got your mind spinning
Head flown from the eclectic
Fuck up your electrics
No audio, no visual
Your city goes up in flames
No remorse for the slain victims
The same curriculum goes for the next mission
This is the North Star microphone type violence
Pilot wings gunnin' MC's like a F-18 jet fighter
The Spiderman swinging through your neighbourhood
Takin' out your Kingpin
Get inside you like I'm Sabrewolf
I got the killer instincts
I don't blink
Before you get heat seek with the onslaught

Think, think, think
You think about it

Think, think, think
You think about it

Think, think, think
You think about it

Think, think, think
You think about it

If you control a man's thoughts
You don't have to worry about his actions
So think about that
Rather think about it in traction
For a fraction of the cost you could be bossed
But you suffer from inflation cause your mind is straight lost
Why you worrying about us
What's occurring right now is
We makin' power moves and you don't even know how
You fret and fume and claim Hiero is doomed
But your hating won't alter
We still won't falter
We plotting our own maps
We clocking our own snaps
If you think you so smart
Tell me why you ain't known that

Think, think, think
You think about it

(That was stupid, peep)
You think we're weak so
Our fans think we're the dopest
So there's something else for your people mind to focus on
Who wrote this song
The mighty Hiero
You thought we was dead, pfffttt
Alive on arrival
Biofeedback, we'll fry your weave back to the follicles 
And shrink your brain to the size of a molecule
Follow you, never, you dumb
I'm like the thinker
Constant elevation, that's why I like to tinker
With rhymes and concepts
So I can stay one step beyond
Learnin' about the planet we on
I'm not sayin' I'm the smartest
But there's a lot of targets
To take my mind to
Cause that's part of being an artist

Think, think, think
You think about it

Think, think, think
You think about it

The magnetic flux inducted when I touch the mic is acupuncture
Fluctuated in the lotus poles through your solar plexus
I bust a rap through a cardiac arrest
The reflex of charges convulse your carcass
Like a heart attack
Then charge you wack emcees for life support
While the mics record
You're a gun done plunging in total blackness
My retrospect is photographic
I got constellations in (Flabacastal?)
To flabbergast you Siamese emcees
The tumultuous maelstrom is bone crushing
On all who approach Hieroglyphics
Too relentless to break your style down to cubic inches
Sterilized like dentures
Paralyzed inventive
Like Jan Matchslinger
I'm not a gat slinger Goldfinger
Niggas is polygamous like bigots
Working for genocide
Everybody knows we rose to preeminence
Sharp witted like diamond tipped rhombuses
Every direction on your compass stabilized
No transfusing the intoxication we profusely drop so fatally
Huh, I think you are spurring a blind horse
We're set to rule the universe with mind force

Think, think, think
You think about it

Think, think, think
You think about it

Think, think, think
You think about it

Think, think, think
You think about it

Gimme 6 lines...6 lines...that's all I need

[Pep Love]
Alright, ok
I write in the light of day and in the night for pay, nigga!
You my main motherfucker, right?
You duck and hide when Pep Love touch a mic
Out the back door
If you ain't got that dough
I'll click clack blow and kick down doors
I roll backwood trees with that emerald green
When I'm on the scene, chillin with my nigga Rolls gettin blown
Watchin ladies with them pretty eyes and straight teeth
Sittin' in my ride, playin make belief
Like that's my car!
That's my girl!
I'ma go up to my house in the hills after I burn one
I write rhymes for the fun of it
But give me all my money or your gonna be facin capital punishment
I'ma soldier of fortune
My style is extortion
And I'm gorging more than a portion


[Tajai]
Take an excoursion, oceanography odyssey-D
Ballin' 3-D
You don't want to see me, not for one second!
Not for one bar on one record
You think you come hard, then come test it
I'll turn a threat into a confession
I'll turn a mic into a blunt weapon
Make you forget what you was once reppin'
See I'm a bass drum beater
Mad high hatter
Ensnare the snare with this here
Choke the life out 'it
Revive it and vitalize 'it
Prop it up proper so you guys'll idolize it
I'm not at all surprised that you're modelled after my shit
The masterminds is ahead of whatever the times is!

You niggaz saps...maple leaf
All your raps is make believe
I get an eighth and breathe like I'm Toni Braxton
Get up on the action...you gettin no reaction
Slowly stogie packin'
Lean back one foot up
Your style is put up
My turn to burn good up
You're boring...I'll suffocate you while you're snoring
'Kill 'em Softly' like Lauren
You spit and I'm pouring
My flow's adequately hydrated
And I waited to vibrate it
It's live ain't it!
Fuck with me, get stuck with cutlery
Luxury, I'm living luckily!

[Opio]
Music is my sanctuary (it's my life!)
They shootin blanks
My every round is a live one
Surviving the mind numbing propaganda
Eyes closed with blindfolds
Handcuffed and ambushed, struck by the lightning bolt (oh shit!)
I'm comin out your plasma screen like 'The Ring'
Make excellent cadavers of your fascist regime
Cause I grab the mic and niggaz couldn't understand
Why I'm fuckin' up your summer jam like the son of sam
And punishin'
Dressed in black with a skull on chest
And holdin' my nuts exposin my 5-star general
That's spittin flow...unpredictable
Ricochetin'

Velcome all vulnerable vocalists
Visualize vivid verb play in my vortex
Virtually, no verse'll be vinnin ova me...they vapor
My verbal voltage vanquishes
Parental advisory
Vamoose...I'll vick your vitality
Vindictive with voodoo
Valiantly save the virgin from the viper
Vanglorious vide vorld of volcanic violence
Your vessel gets violated over the velm
Veracious, vivacious
Veto your village voice
Void your vibration
Vultures got me vergin' on vomitin' they vishfullness
Get's met with visciousness
Every verb's visceral

A clip will cripple foes
Crucifix for (mental?) cliques

Reverberate for your convertible

[Phesto]
Yeah...yeah
Hard nose in the contest like Ron Artess
The con artist
Bombard 'em and start 'em in Vangar (?) shit
Get serious...grown from expeirence, and our shit
A lyricist to the tissue...bones and cartilage
My fare for the hair raising
Razor sharp with rare phrasing
Perfectly scripted like Scorcese's 'Raging Bull'
Lanky like Hiralanko (?)
Paid in full
I skipped grades in school
Exhume verb and further with no sherm (?) on the burner
Mostly Turkish hash on the purple grass in the sterling
Wave your checkered flags, I'm world class in the derby
Paragraphs off the flow chart topsy-turvy

[A Plus]
Yeah...every day A respresent
With a weed habit affecting the trade defecit
They ain't never met...nobody like me
Til they comin' in from work...see me holdin they wifey
In the 80's, I was spoken ice
Not from diamonds, but rhymin' and flowin precise
Type of nigga that get ya scolded politely
It really wouldn't show if I was holdin'
That's why no one would fight me
Bush bombed Afghanistan with the missles
And it still ain't puttin' my hash man outta business

Classical massacres occurs in a flash, a blur
Smashin' our hammer
Then when we clash with words
Adrenalin rush shatter you fragile gentlemen
When I hit 'em up with agile style
Venom and change the game like two ways did pagers
And 2Pac did before the plagerist came
Sword swing around, we not horsing
I'ma do mine, you do your thing
Hieroglyphics is monolithic
Chronicle and I careen in on a collision course to contradiction
God is listenin'
We collage, analyze with the touch of a brush to paint this picture
I'm heart felt with the texture of velvet
My art propellin'...the wax start meltin'
We makin' the matrix break to this
And motivatin' the shake...complacentness
Mixed of many maneuvers
We get blitzed and the groove is deep as it gets to reap benefits
From Oakland to Brooklyn
The language spoken...broken and crooked

Slipping the clip in and put your pistol back on your hip
And I'm giving you half of the wild green

These are the Street Scriptures for all my riders, niggas, and hoes
Let me ask you a question,
Why give a bitch fame by sayin' his name?
When all I gotta say is you's a bitch
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you nigga
You ain't no killa, on the riz-illa
So High Beam my nigga, get with 'em

Ah!

When I look that fool in his face and tell him he's a lie
Everybody want a cure but nobody want to die
Put the cash in my face, I might take a try
Money motivated that nigga that threw up my sign
My wife's on my side with a .9 ready to ride
Hold my sixth sense up and ask buddy why
Shit get deep in the cold city of Chi
Could somebody, anybody tell me why-ay
Why yeah why yeah
Why yeah why yeah these boys they want to try me
Why yeah why yeah
Why yeah why yeah but these boys don't want to die

Straight down to earth with my real niggas crack 'em beers
Straight up that mean mug motherfucker havin' no fear
What the fuck
You thought I was one of them bitch niggas standin' right here
Legit Ballas is the clique I break bread with
Niggas I bust lead with
In the midst of confrontation, high-speed chasin'
Bend 'em, and bust 'em and stick 'em, I'm runnin' from the FED's shit
This is the New Testament, uh-huh we never dead bitch, no

I'll make that damn fool get on his knees and say please
Bitches in the neighborhood spreadin' disease
Hatin' ass niggas starin' and studyin' me
Cause I'm fresh up out the bank to get my daughter some cheese
But I got somethin' on my side like a lemon to squeeze
Lickin' bout a pack up at you motherfuckers right at the knees
Probably givin' somethin' to fools cause the man in need
I been deep up in this game for a century
Now I'm makin' major moves and stackin' paper is my motto
Different day, different gear, hoppin' out a different auto
Put it on and I'll be jackin' off louchers like lotto
Showin' love to my niggas who show me love in Chicago
It's fair but it's square, for the love of the game or they hate it
Many done died, plenty done tried from imitatin' it
Fuck what they say, keep faith in this world you'll make it
Thank him for everything and every blessin' but don't fake it

That's why I stay high, gone off green

Why you all in my business
Why you really really want to know the 4-1-1
Is it cause that my game's tight
I can scoop a bitch and fuck her on the same night

It was a, Saturday evening bout seven at night
White T, white thongs pockets feeling alright
I got a, call from one of my caramel chicks
She said I mean be careful I think they talking on some hate shit
Despite the talk of the town, I'ma be there
For 45 minutes when you hear the horn come down
And when she climbed in, I received a kiss and a hug
In a minute take off your shoes on a white persian rug
Wave your number rolling going to get bent
Why they sure call thugs mugging I see him right through the tent
He had the nerve enough to tap on my glass
But he ain't had enough light to peek in but I almost blast his ass
Is it cause that I'm known to bust
So quick to bump a bad bitch that y'all known to trust
So when you see me on them thangs in the Cadillac truck
Man don't even know me when you see your bitch in the back or front

Foul, god damn you hagging
Sixteen block my wall you want to block my magic
Now you wondering no what Nitty be doing
While these bitches trying to find out who am I screwing
And I'm so, sick and tired of the motherfucking gossip
And I'm, sick and tired of the motherfucking coppers
They actually post up at the end of my block
Take a hoe from her spot just for trying to plot

And I'm like, damn friendly why you all on me
Man I'm out here slanging records shit I stopped selling weed
Tell me, are you mad cause you see what I drive
Or are you checking out these broads with the big ass thighs
It be my main bitch, getting on my last nerves
closest now to the edge from getting kicked to the curb
She got a homegirl, all up in her hair
Maybe they just meant my hair's longer than her's

[Chorus x2]

And I'm, sick of them haters that be all in my shit
Everytime I turn around somebody always be talking bout Twist
Want to know who got a baby by me, what does he drive, where my tip
Be all in my bidness because they heard that I've been bumping they chick
I ain't no lie, if I scoop your bitch up
I will, If I get scratch from her
Fold it up, if I tell her bend over
She won't get up, if I give up the bunch
What you need to know fo', you the player po-po
Steady beeking and poking paranoia smoking on too much doe-doe
Creeping all in my bid' no since I first splurged on a Rego
I got birds when I see you, I'm starting to think you work for them people
Hurt 'em when I tell 'em, I think you better ease up, cause everybody
Know you no G when it come to the money put some g's up
Until you hip lock and freeze up, you might as well
Turn around and go like the other way when I see you

[Chorus x2]

See me riding real slick thick and rolling on thangs
Got the misses and the bitches want to know my name
They want to know what I'm on
Get the fuck up out of mine homie go on and get your own
Riding slick with the cherry wood grain
In my big boy truck with the candy paint
Why, bitches giving me brain
I know you want to ball like me but you can't
Stay the fuck up out my business man

Let me see you pop that shit for daddy

Diamonds flick up protect your tip tattoo bezel that lift up

Grinning, Sprewells spinning, but I'm standing still
Man trying to call up this zig-zotic hot mama out by the Ville then
I'm talking top flight, high priced brown sugar
With the curly butter, thick hips and all 
With the easy-e kitty cat paws, tatted above her bra
When the Twist sat down by her draws
But I guess that leaves dust and all
Cause a man keeps on running off
Just dropping her cheese, but shorty got me's
Taking trips to the tat shop, come on the black top
Let her feel Anita while we sold be	's

Fish that pearl, and then show it off to the world

Check my name and Eddy came, oops I don't mean to be rude
I got a fetish for oops I mean I love some tattoos

Ain't got an A and the ointment but I got some Vaseline

And then she suck me like a neckbone
I've been gone slap then I took the Milly that home
Since nobody needed to drive I'ma be the one they gone put it on
(did you know me daddy) Man I ain't even have to ask shorty
It was right before my eyes, tattoos on her chest
Snake wrapped around her legs all the way up to her thighs
Her size, scrumptious fulfilling the fantasy of me and my guys
When she pulled her pants down 
Made me want to buck she oh my, what a surprise
Man I'm hoping, she'll let a nigga get it wet I gets wild and open
Way too provoking, on the beach rubbing her body down with suntan lotion
What's that, another tat with the Playboy bunny by her cootie cat
Got one going in the crack of her ass 
But she can't really see cause her booty fat
Girl you don't know what I'd do to that
got limo scrapes ride the butter crack
Put Legit Ballin all across your back, take that off and let me see that
