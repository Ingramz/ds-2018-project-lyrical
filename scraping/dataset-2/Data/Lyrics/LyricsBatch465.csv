I heard your best friend say
You shouldn't have treated her that way
You could've been a little bit kinder
He didn't send you no note
Didn't give you no gift
He didn't even try to find ya

Well, that's too bad, too bad
Too bad on your birthday
I said it's too bad, too bad
Too bad on your birthday

You were my love once
It lasted several months
And I was in love even blinder
When you left me I cried
All my tears haven't dried
So I'm leavin' this little reminder

Oh, it's too bad, too bad
Too bad on your birthday
Oh, too bad, too bad
Too bad on your birthday

And now you're the girl
With cake on her face
Yeah, you're the one who's cryin'
Blow out the candles and make a wish
If you need a drink, babe
I'm buyin', yeah

I will not take off my clothes
I will not be rude
For what I have done
Is come to rock you

Late at night while the normals rest
I feel wicked when I start to dress
My clothes, they stare at me like they
Wanna make love to my body
I'm not a dream but I'm supreme and if ya
Listen to the sky you see what I mean
When it rains outside, people run and hide
I walk the streets and start to pry
And wonder was I here before?
In another life? Yes! I'm sure but what
As I suppose why do I get power from these clothes

Black leather, I wear it on stage
Black leather, I'm gonna wear it to my grave
Black leather, I will wear it anywhere
Because my name is JOAN JETT and I don't care
Just the feel of it on my flesh makes me
Feel wild feel possessed
But I'm not don't get me wrong
I'm the baddest slick chick just singin'
This song

Lilly white dresses sure they're cute
They also attract a lot of men to you
But they make you feel real vulnerable
From anything that got muscle
But ya cannot take what I would not give
'cause that's the truth that's how I live

Listen don't slick talk me to make me indulge
'cause I am JOAN and I am luv!
I have this friend in a waterbed
He's real wild when he's soak'n'wet
Yo JOAN let's hang till the early dawn
SCORP chill till I put my leather on

Black leather, I wear it on stage
Black leather, I'm gonna wear it to my grave
Black leather, I will wear it anywhere
Because my name is JOAN JETT and I don't care
Just the feel of it on my flesh make me
Feel wild feel possessed
But I'm not don't get me wrong
I'm the baddest slick chick and I'm singin'
This song

This is true I gotta show no shame
I was born to freak and I'm to blame?
I coulda been a mailman in any weather
Instead I'm rockin' away in my leather
When I was young I wore skirts and lace
My father told me to slow down my pace
His friends would come over and get in my face
And ask the same question mine or your place?
It's alright to be treated like a lady
I couldn't wait till that notion ceased
My friends thought that I was a little angel
I couldn't help it if I felt like a beast
So when I die don't worry about a coffin
There won't be no ashes to stuff in the urn
Jus' lay me out toss on the charcoal lighter
An' fire me up smell the leather burn

Black leather, I wear it on stage
Black leather, I'm gonna wear it to my grave
Black leather, I will wear it anywhere
Because my name is JOAN JETT and I don't care
Just the feel of it on my flesh make me
Feel wild feel possessed
But I'm not don't get me wrong

Everyone that I can see is gettin' right in tow
Changin' songs to be on the radio
Now there are things that I believe in
I'd never sell my soul
It always feels so good to hear good music

I need good music--Good good music
It always feels so good to hear good music

How can I get back to you when I'm so far from home
In any port or foreign shore-alone
So many ways to be betrayed believe me when I say
I think that I would die without good music

I need good music--Good good music
It always feels so good to hear good music
I know that I would die without good music

I need good music--Good good music
It always feels so good to hear good music
I know that I would die without good music

And even though you might think it's funny
I couldn't care if there ain't no money
I'm a little mixed up
But I'll be alright
If I can hear a loud guitar all night

Joan Jett,"Talkin' heads are talkin'
But listen to what they say
How they sit in judgement
An' claim to know the way
If dreams can be dismembered
An' our worth can be ignored
Need a new direction
Cause this one we can't afford

There's bad stuff happening
An' no one does a thing

What can I do
What can I say
When they just speak at
Us in riddles
How can this be
Why can't ya see
That they just speak
At us in riddles

Got ourselves in trouble
With no relief in sight
Everyday is such a struggle
Cause they had to pick a fight

How can this be happening
Can't we do anything

What can I do
What can I say
When they just speak at
Us in riddles
How can this be
Why can't ya see
That they just speak
At us in riddles

The peace is the war
The rich are too poor
An' they just speak at us in riddles
How can this be
Why can't ya see
That they just speak at us in riddles
We're stuck right in the middle

Clear skies baby
Healthy forests
No Child Left Behind
Wake up people

Big Brother is watchin' you
They're takin' all your rights away
Don't claim that you represent me cause
I don't believe a word that ya say

What can I do
What can I say
When they just speak at
Us in riddles
How can this be

That they just speak

The changes that we both went through 
Was it all a game? 
I know that it was real to me

You acted like a slave to me

Man you're lookin' wasted
Greasy wheels, streets of steel
No tellin' what ya tasted

Sad you are so shattered

Wasted lives of wasted drives
Wasted days an' wasted nights
Wasted this an' wasted that
Wasted is where you're at

Got iron in their hands
Cotton sound, lost an' found
Is in every crazy man

China white, don't treat ya right
Sad you are so shattered

Wasted lives of wasted drives
Wasted days an' wasted nights
Wasted this an' wasted that
Wasted is where you're at

Got beach rats on the run
Golden tractors, low plus factors
Silver bullets, rubber gun

The truest love you've known

What'll I do if you ever take your love from me?
'Cause in your arms is where I always want to be

And the heartaches I would feel
Would last a thousand years

Joan Jett & the Blackhearts,"Baby, baby, can't you see what you're doing to me?
I couldn't sleep a wink last night just a-thinking of you
Baby things weren't right I kept on tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin'  tossin' and turnin' all night
I threw the blankets on the floor, turned my pillow upside down
Then I thought of you some more
And I kept on tossin' and turnin' turnin' and tossin' 
Tossin' and turnin' all night
Jumped out of bed, turned on the light
Pulled down the shade went to the kitchen for a bite
Pulled up the shade, turned off the light
I jumped back into bed it was the middle of the night
The clock downstairs was striking four, couldn't get you off my mind
Heard the milkman at the door but I was tossin' and turnin'",Tossin' & Turnin',1983

But there are things
I can't explain
Like havin' dreams come true
While all the world
Is sad and cold
Look at me and you

We have so much
Why don't I feel happy, baby?
I love you so much
Why can't we be happy?


Every time we have a fight
It hurts me through and through
And all at once I'm so unsure
What I'm supposed to do
Even so I always know I'll spend my life with you

We have so much
Why don't I feel happy, baby?
I love you so much
Why can't we be happy?

No one can satisfy
The needs in me but you
I try to speak my mind to you
But you don't hear me

I gotta get off by myself
An' have a drink or two
'cause lately I been so uptight from
What we're goin' through
To live without you
Would hurt no doubt
I never wanted to

That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's

Johnny jumped the counter but he stumbled and fell

Go Tulane, he ain't man enough for you
Go Tulane, use all the speed you got
Go Tulane, you know you need a lot
Go Tulane, he's laggin' behind
Go 'head on, Tulane go head on

Go by your father's house and tell him business is slow
And see if he will loan us something, soon as he hits the dough
Put the cat out in the hall and rumple up the room
Go by Doctor Keller's, tell him you swallowed some perfume
Tell him we need him quick, 'cause he may have to testify
That you been sick all day and that's a perfect alibi

Go ahead on, Tulane, he can't catch up with you
Go Tulane, he ain't man enough for you
Go Tulane, use all the speed you got
Go Tulane, you know you need a lot
Go Tulane, he's laggin' behind

Go, let Danny drive in case you run into the Man
Back by the shop and git the stuff and hide it in the van
Go back by your father's, get the money for the bail
And bring it down and bail me out this rotten, funky jail
We gotta get a lawyer in the click of politics
Somebody who can win the thing or get the thing fix

Go ahead on, Tulane, he can't catch up with you

Now you listen to what I say

Why don't you just go away?

You took me around and you showed me the town
I thought you were kind of nice
But if someone stepped in with more to show
You'd drop me without thinkin' twice

You tie yourself to my apron strings
Thinkin' your friends will be impressed
You get your way by bribin' me
Tellin' me I'm the best

Don't abuse me
Now you listen to what I say
If you're tryin' to use me
Why don't you just go away?

Who can I trust and where can I go
To find someone who truly wants me?
Take me for what I am
That's the way it's gotta be

Que vio a Carancha recibir un día,
Tiene mustia la piel, el pelo cano,
Ojos velados por melancolía,

Bajo el bigote gris, labios de hastío,
Y una triste expresión que no es tristeza,
Sino algo más y menos, el vacío
Del mundo en la oquedad de su cabeza.

Aún luce de corinto terciopelo
Chaqueta y pantalón abotinado,
Y un cordobés color de caramelo
Pulido y torneado.

Tres veces heredó y tres ha perdido
Al monte su caudal, dos ha enviudado.
Sólo se anima ante el azar prohibido
Sobre el verde tapete reclinado,

O al evocar la tarde de un torero,
La suerte de un tahúr o si alguien cuenta
La hazaña de un gallardo bandolero,
O la proeza de un matón, sangrienta.

Bosteza de políticas banales
Dicterios al gobierno reaccionario
Y augura que vendrán los liberales
Cual torna la cigüeña al campanario.

Un poco labrador, del cielo aguarda
Y al cielo teme, alguna vez suspira
Pensando en su olivar, al cielo mira
Con ojo inquieto si la lluvia tarda.

Prisionero en la Arcadia del presente,
Le aburre, sólo el humo del tabaco
Simula algunas sombras en su frente.

Sin nombre, sin patrón 
Y sin bandera
Navegando sin timón 
Donde la corriente quiera

Aventurero audaz
Jinete de papel 
Cuadriculado
Que mi mano sin pasado 
Sentó a lomos de un canal

Cuando el canal era un río
Cuando el estanque era el mar
Y navegar
Era jugar con el viento
Era una sonrisa a tiempo
Fugándose feliz
De país en país

Que lo que nunca he tenido
Nada mas amado que lo que perdí
Perdóname si hoy busco en la arena
Esa luna llena que araba el mar

Si alguna vez fui un ave de paso
Lo olvide para anidar hay en tus brazos
Si alguna vez fui tierno y fui bueno
Fue enredado en tu cuello y tus senos
Si alguna ve fui sabio en amores
Lo aprendí de tus labios cantores

Si alguna vez amé, si algún día
Después de amar, amé
Fue por tu amor, Lucia, Lucia

Tus recuerdos son cada da mas dulces
El olvido solo se llevé la mitad
Y tu sombra aun se acuesta en mi cama
Con la oscuridad entre mi almohada y mi soledad

Nada mas amado que lo que perdí

Sigue jugando en tu playa
Y escondido tras las cañas
Duerme mi primer amor
Llevo tu luz y tu olor
Por dondequiera que vaya
Y amontonado en tu arena
Guardo amor, juegos y penas

Yo, que en la piel tengo el sabor
Amargo del llanto eterno
Que han vertido en ti cien pueblos
De Algeciras a Estambul
Para que pintes de azul
Sus largas noches de invierno
A fuerza de desventuras
Tu alma es profunda y oscura

A tus atardeceres rojos

Que se conoce y se teme

Viene a buscarme la parca
Empujad al mar mi barca
Con un levante otoñal
Y dejad que el temporal
Desguace sus alas blancas
Y a mí enterradme sin duelo

Más alto que el horizonte
Quiero tener buena vista

Duerme mi pueblo blanco 
Bajo un cielo que, a fuerza 
De no ver nunca el mar

Sólo el olvido 
Camina lento bordeando la cañada 
Donde no crece una flor 
Ni trashuma un pastor

Hacerse viejo al cura
El cura ha visto al cabo 
Y el cabo al sacristán

Su historia en el umbral 
De sus casas de cal
Y las muchachas hacen bolillos 
Buscando, ocultas tras los visillos

Que, noche a noche, forjaron en su mente
Fuerte para ser su señor
Tierno para el amor

Ellas sueñan con él
Y él con irse muy lejos 
De su pueblo y los viejos 
Sueñan morirse en paz
Y morir por morir
Quieren morirse al sol
La boca abierta al calor, como lagartos
Medio ocultos tras un sombrero de esparto

Escapad gente tierna
Que esta tierra está enferma
Y no esperes mañana 
Lo que no se os dio ayer
Que no hay nada que hacer
Toma tu mula, tu hembra y tu arreo
Sigue el camino del pueblo hebreo 
Y busca otra luna
Tal vez mañana sonría la fortuna
Y si te toca llorar 
Es mejor frente al mar

Si yo pudiera unirme 
A un vuelo de palomas

Nena, qué va a ser de ti

Esperaste en el sillón

Dejadme en paz

No me siento extranjero en ningún lugar 
Donde haya lumbre y vino tengo mi hogar
Y para no olvidarme de lo que fuí 
Mi patria y mi guitarra la llevo en mí
Una es fuerte y es fiel
La otra un papel

No llores porque no me voy a quedar

Y el vino que me ayuda a olvidar mi sed
Que más puede ofrecer

No hago otra cosa que pensar en ti
Y no se me ocurre nada

Enciendo un cigarrillo, y otro más

Muy seriamente dejar de fumar
Con esa tos que me entra al levantarme

Busqué, mirando al cielo, inspiración
Y me quedé colgao en las alturas
Por cierto al techo no le iría nada mal
Una mano de pintura

Miré por la ventana y me fugué

No hacia más que rascarse la cabeza

No hago otra cosa que pensar en tí
Nada me gusta más que hacer canciones
Pero hoy las musas han pasao de mí
Andarán de vacaciones",No Hago Otra Cosa Que Pensar en Ti,1981
Joan Manuel Serrat,"Probablemente en su pueblo se les recordará 
Como cachorros de buenas personas, 
Que hurtaban flores para regalar a su mamá 
Y daban de comer a las palomas. 

Probablemente que todo eso debe ser verdad, 
Aunque es más turbio cómo y de qué manera 
Llegaron esos individuos a ser lo que son 
Ni a quién sirven cuando alzan las banderas. 

Hombres de paja que usan la colonia y el honor 
Para ocultar oscuras intenciones
Tienen doble vida, son sicarios del mal. 
Entre esos tipos y yo hay algo personal. 

Rodeados de protocolo, comitiva y seguridad, 
Viajan de incógnito en autos blindados 
A sembrar calumnias, a mentir con naturalidad, 
A colgar en las escuelas su retrato. 

Se gastan más de lo que tienen en coleccionar 
Espías, listas negras y arsenales
Resulta bochornoso verles fanfarronear 
A ver quién es el que la tiene más grande. 

Se arman hasta los dientes en el nombre de la paz, 
Juegan con cosas que no tienen repuesto 
Y la culpa es del otro si algo les sale mal. 
Entre esos tipos y yo hay algo personal. 

Y como quien en la cosa, nada tiene que perder. 
Pulsan la alarma y rompen las promesas 
Y en nombre de quien no tienen el gusto de conocer 
Nos ponen la pistola en la cabeza. 

Se agarran de los pelos, pero para no ensuciar 
Van a cagar a casa de otra gente 
Y experimentan nuevos métodos de masacrar, 
Sofisticados y a la vez convincentes. 

No conocen ni a su padre cuando pierden el control, 
Ni recuerdan que en el mundo hay niños. 
Nos niegan a todos el pan y la sal. 
Entre esos tipos y yo hay algo personal. 

Pero, eso sí, los sicarios no pierden ocasión 
De declarar públicamente su empeño 
En propiciar un diálogo de franca distensión 
Que les permita hallar un marco previo 

Que garantice unas premisas mínimas 
Que faciliten crear los resortes 
Que impulsen un punto de partida sólido y capaz 
De este a oeste y de sur a norte, 

Donde establecer las bases de un tratado de amistad 
Que contribuya a poner los cimientos 
De una plataforma donde edificar 
Un hermoso futuro de amor y paz.",Algo Personal,1984
Joan Manuel Serrat,"Cada loco con su tema
contra gustos no hay disputa
artefactos, bestias, hombres why mujeres
cada uno es como es,
cada quien es cada cual.

why baja las escaleras como quiere
pero puestos a escoger... soy partidario. 

De las voces de la calle
más que del diccionario.
Me privan más los barrios
que el centro de la ciudad.
why los artesanos más
que la factoría.
La razón que la fuerza
el instinto que la urbanidad.
why un siux más
que el séptimo de caballería.

Prefiero los caminos a las fronteras
why una mariposa al Rockefeller Center
why alfarero de Capdevera al vigía de occidente.
Prefiero querer a poder,
palpar a pisar;
ganar a perder,
besar a reir,
bailar a desfilar,
why disfrutar a medir.
Prefiero volar a correr,
hacer a pensar;
Amar a querer,
tomar a pedir,
antes que nada soy
partidario de vivir.

why baja las escaleras como quiere 
pero puestos a escoger... prefiero
 
Un buen polvo a un rapapolvo
why un bombero a un bombardero,
crecer a sentar cabeza,
prefiero la carne al metal;
why las ventanas a las ventanillas,
el lunar de tu cara
a la pinacoteca nacional
why la revolución
a las pesadillas.

Prefiero el tiempo al oro,
la vida al sueño,
el perro al collar,
las nueces al ruido,
why al sabio por conocer
que a los locos conocidos.

Joan Manuel Serrat,"Todo pasa y todo queda
Pero lo nuestro es pasar
Pasar haciendo caminos
Caminos sobre la mar

Nunca perseguí la gloria
Ni dejar en la memoria 
De los hombres mi canción
Yo amo los mundos sutiles
Ingrávidos y gentiles
Como pompas de jabón

Me gusta verlos pintarse 
De sol y grana, volar 
Bajo el cielo azul, temblar 
Súbitamente y quebrarse

Nunca perseguí la gloria

Caminante, son tus huellas 
El camino y nada más
Caminante, no hay camino
Se hace camino al andar

Al andar se hace camino 
Y al volver la vista atrás 
Se ve la senda que nunca 
Se ha de volver a pisar

Caminante no hay camino 
Sino estelas en la mar

Hace algún tiempo en ese lugar 
Donde hoy los bosques se visten de espinos 
Se oyó la voz de un poeta gritar
«caminante no hay camino
Se hace camino al andar» 
Golpe a golpe, verso a verso 

Murió el poeta lejos del hogar
Le cubre el polvo de un país vecino
Al alejarse le vieron llorar
«caminante no hay camino
Se hace camino al andar» 
Golpe a golpe, verso a verso 

Cuando el jilguero no puede cantar
Cuando el poeta es un peregrino
Cuando de nada nos sirve rezar
«caminante no hay camino
Se hace camino al andar» 
Golpe a golpe, verso a verso",Cantares,1984
Joan Manuel Serrat,"De ves en cuando la vida 
Nos besa en la boca 
Y a colores se despliega como un atlas 
Nos pasea por las calles en bolandas 
Y los sentidos en buenas manos

Se hace de nuestra medida 
Toma nuestro paso 
Y saca un conejo de la vieja chistera 
Y uno es feliz como un niño 
Cuando sale de la escuela

De ves en cuando la vida 
Toma conmigo café 
Y esta tan bonita que da gusto verla 
Se suelta el pelo y me invita 
A salir con ella a escena

De ves en cuando la vida 
Se nos brinda en cuero 
Y nos regala un sueño tan escurridizo 
Que hay que andarlo de puntillas 
Por no romper el hechizo

De ves en cuando la vida 
Afina con el pincel 
Se nos eriza la piel, y faltan palabras 
Para nombrar lo que ofrecen 
A los que saben usarla

De ves en cuando la vida 
Nos gasta una broma 
Y nos despertamos sin saber que pasa 
Chupando un pavo sentado 
Sobre una calabaza",De Vez en Cuando la Vida,1984
Joan Manuel Serrat,"A menudo los hijos se nos parecen
Así nos dan la primera satisfacción
Esos que se menean con nuestros gestos
Echando mano a cuanto hay a su alrededor
Esos locos bajitos que se incorporan 
Con los ojos abiertos de par en par
Sin respeto al horario ni a las costumbres 
Y a los que, por su bien, hay que domesticar

Niño, deja ya de joder con la pelota
Niño, que eso no se dice
Que eso no se hace
Que eso no se toca

Cargan con nuestros dioses y nuestro idioma
Nuestros rencores y nuestro porvenir
Por eso nos parece que son de goma 
Y que les bastan nuestros cuentos para dormir

Nos empeñamos en dirigir sus vidas 
Sin saber el oficio y sin vocación
Les vamos trasmitiendo nuestras frustraciones 
Con la leche templada y en cada canción

Niño, deja ya de joder con la pelota

Nada ni nadie puede impedir que sufran
Que las agujas avancen en el reloj
Que decidan por ellos, que se equivoquen
Que crezcan y que un día nos digan adiós",Esos Locos Bajitos,1984
Joan Manuel Serrat,"Gloria a Dios en las alturas,
Recogieron las basuras
De mi calle, ayer a oscuras
Y hoy sembrada de bombillas.

Y colgaron de un cordel
De esquina a esquina un cartel
Y banderas de papel
Verdes, rojas y amarillas.

Y al darles el sol la espalda
Revolotean las faldas
Bajo un manto de guirnaldas
Para que el cielo no vea,

En la noche de San Juan,
Cómo comparten su pan,
Su tortilla y su gabán,
Gentes de cien mil raleas.

Apurad
Que allí os espero si queréis venir
Pues cae la noche y ya se van
Nuestras miserias a dormir.

Vamos subiendo la cuesta
Que arriba mi calle
Se vistió de fiesta.

Hoy el noble y el villano,
El prohombre y el gusano
Bailan y se dan la mano
Sin importarles la facha.

Juntos los encuentra el sol
A la sombra de un farol
Empapados en alcohol
Abrazando a una muchacha.

Y con la resaca a cuestas
Vuelve el pobre a su pobreza,
Vuelve el rico a su riqueza
Y el señor cura a sus misas.

Se despertó el bien y el mal
La pobre vuelve al portal,
La rica vuelve al rosal,
Y el avaro a las divisas.

Se acabó,
El sol nos dice que llegó el final,
Por una noche se olvidó
Que cada uno es cada cual.

Vamos bajando la cuesta
Que arriba en mi calle
Se acabó la fiesta",Fiesta,1984
Joan Manuel Serrat,"Para la libertad, sangro, lucho, pervivo
Para la libertad, mis ojos y mis manos 
Como un árbol carnal, generoso y cautivo
Doy a los cirujanos
Para la libertad siento más corazones 
Que arenas en mi pecho: dan espumas 
Mis venas
Y entro en los hospitales, y entro en 
Los algodones 
Como en las azucenas

Porque donde unas cuencas vacías 
Amanezcan 
Ella pondrá dos piedras de futura mirada 
Y hará que nuevos brazos y nuevas 
Piernas crezcan 
En la carne talada

Retoñarán aladas de savia sin otoño 
Reliquias de mi cuerpo que pierdo en 
Cada herida
Porque soy como el árbol talado
Que retoño",Para la Libertad,1984
Joan Manuel Serrat,"Ella em va estimar tant
Jo me l'estimo encara
Plegats vam travessar

Ella qui sap on és
Ella qui sap on para

Para quitarle los clavos 
A Jesús el nazareno?""

Al cristo de los gitanos 
Siempre con sangre en las manos, 
Siempre por desenclavar. 

Cantar del pueblo andaluz 
Que todas las primaveras 
Anda pidiendo escaleras 
Para subir a la cruz. 

Cantar de la tierra mía 
Que echa flores 
Al Jesús de la agonía 
Y es la fe de mis mayores. 

Oh, no eres tu mi cantar 
No puedo cantar, ni quiero 
A ese Jesús del madero, 
Sino el que anduvo en la mar?

Que anés equivocat 
I que el wàter no fos ocupat

Que fes un bon dia 
I que ens fes bon pes
Que sant pere, pagant, no cantés

Seria fantàstic 
Que res no fos urgent
No passar mai de llarg I servir per quelcom
Anar per la vida sense compliments 
Anomenant les coses pel seu nom
Cobrar en espècies I sentir-se ben tractat 
I pixar-se de riure I fer volar coloms

Seria tot un detall
Tot un símptoma d'urbanitat
Que no perdessin sempre els mateixos 
I que heretessin els desheretats

Seria fantàstic 
Que guanyés el millor 
I que la força no fos la raó

Que tot fos com és manat I ningú no manés
Que arribés el dia del sentit comú
Trobar-se com a casa a tot arreu

Escondida en cada gesto 
Del derecho y del revés

Y no es prudente ir camuflado 
Eternamente por ahí

Ni para ir a ningún lado 

No me pidas que no piense 
En voz alta por mi bien 
Ni que me suba a un taburete 
Si quieres probare a crecer

Joan Manuel Serrat,"La despertará el viento de un golpe en los postigos. 
Su cama es tan larga y tan ancha.Y las sábanas están frías
Con los ojos medio cerrados buscará otra mano, 
Sin encontrar ninguna, como ayer, como mañana. 

Su soledad es el amante fiel, 
Que conoce su cuerpo pliegue a pliegue, palmo a palmo
Escuchará el maullido de un gato viejo y castrado, 
Que en sus rodillas duerme las largas noches de invierno. 

Hay un misal dormido encima de la mesilla de noche, 
Y un vaso de agua medio vacío cuando se levanta (la tieta)

Un espejo resquebrajado le dirá
Te haces mayor. 
Cómo ha pasado el tiempo! Cómo han volado los años! 
Cómo se han perdido por las calles los sueños de juventud! 
Cómo se arruga la piel, cómo se hunden los ojos!

La portera, a su paso, dibujará una sonrisa: 
Es el orgullo de quien tiene alguien que le caliente la cama. 

Cada día lo mismo: coger el autobús, 
Para trabajar en el despacho de un abogado gandul. 
Con quien en otro tiempo ella se hacía la estrecha. 
De eso hace tanto tiempo Ni lo recuerda «la tieta» (la tía soltera). 
Con quien en otro tiempo ella se hacía la estrecha. 
De eso hace tanto tiempo Ni lo recuerda «la tieta» 

La que siempre tiene un plato cuando llega Navidad. 
La que no quiere nadie si un buen día cae enferma. 
La que no tiene más hijos que los hijos de sus hermanos. 
La que dice:«Todo va bien». La que dice:«¡Qué más da!» 

Y el Domingo de Ramos le comprará a su ahijado, 
Un palmón largo y blanco y un par de calcetines; 
Y en la iglesia los dos harán lo que hace el cura 
Y alabarán a Jesús que entra en Jerusalén 

Le dará veinte duritos para abrir una libreta: 
Hay que ahorrar el dinero, como siempre hizo «la tieta». (la tía soltera) 
Le dará veinte duritos para abrir una libreta: 
Hay que ahorrar el dinero, como siempre hizo «la tieta». 

Y un día se ha de morir, más o menos como todos. 
Se la llevará una gripe al agujero profundo. 

Entonces ya habrá pagado el nicho y el ataúd, 
Los salmos de los sacerdotes, las misas de difuntos 
Y las flores que acompañarán su entierro; 
Son cosas que a menudo las olvida la gente. 

Y son tan bonitas las flores con crespones negros colgando, 
Y detrás unos amigos, descubiertos hace un instante; 
Y una esquela que dice, Ha muerto la señorita
Descanse en paz. AMÉN» Y olvidaremos a «la tieta» (la tía soltera).",La Tieta,1984

Llegan más y más pobres y siguen llegando

Joan Manuel Serrat,"Llueve, detrás de los cristales, llueve why llueve sobre los chopos medio deshojados, sobre los pardos tejados, sobre los campos, llueve. Pintaron de gris el cielo why el suelo se fue abrigando con hojas, se fue vistiendo de otoño. La tarde que se adormece parece un niño que el viento mece con su balada en otoño. Una balada en otoño, un canto triste de melancolía, que nace al morir el día. Una balada en otoño, a veces como un murmullo, why a veces como un lamento why a veces viento. Llueve, detrás de los cristales, llueve why llueve sobre los chopos medio deshojados, sobre los pardos tejados sobre los campos, llueve. Te podría contar que esta quemándose mi último leño en el hogar, que soy muy pobre hoy, que por una sonrisa doy todo lo que soy, porque estoy solo why tengo miedo. Si tú fueras capaz de ver los ojos tristes de una lámpara why hablar con esa porcelana que descubrí ayer why que por un momento se ha vuelto mujer. Entonces, olvidando mi mañana why tu pasado volverías a mi lado. Se va la tarde why me deja la queja que mañana será vieja de una balada en otoño. Llueve, detrás de los cristales, llueve why llueve sobre los chopos medio deshojados...",Balada de Otoño,1994
Joan Manuel Serrat,"Era la gloria vestida de tul 
Con la mirada lejana y azul 
Que sonreía en un escaparate 
Con la boquita menuda y granate, 
Y unos zapatos de falso charol 
Que chispeaban al roce del sol. 
Limpia y bonita. Siempre iba a la moda. 
Arregladita como pa' ir de boda. 

Y yo, a todas horas la iba a ver 
Porque yo amaba a esa mujer 
De cartón piedra, 
Que de San Esteban a Navidades, 
Entre saldos y novedades, 
Hacía más tierna mi acera. 

No era como esas muñecas de abril 
Que me arañaron de frente y perfil. 
Que se comieron mi naranja a gajos. 
Que me arrancaron la ilusión de cuajo, 
Y con la presteza que da el alquiler, 
Olvida el aire que respiró ayer 
Y juega las cartas que le da el momento
Mañana es sólo un adverbio de tiempo. 

No. Ella esperaba en su vitrina 
Verme doblar aquella esquina 
Como una novia. 
Como un pajarillo, pidiéndome
Libérame, libérame
Y huyamos a escribir la historia. 

De una pedrada me cargué el cristal 
Y corrí, corrí con ella hasta mi portal. 
Todo su cuerpo me tembló en los brazos. 
Nos sonreía la luna de marzo. 
Bajo la lluvia bailamos un vals, 
Un, dos, tres, un, dos, tres, todo daba igual, 
Y yo le hablaba de nuestro futuro, 
Y ella lloraba en silencio, os lo juro! 

Y entre cuatro paredes y un techo 
Se reventó contra su pecho 
Pena tras pena. 
Tuve entre mis manos el universo 
E hicimos del pasado un verso 
Perdido dentro de un poema. 

Y entonces, llegaron ellos
Me sacaron a empujones de mi casa 
Y me encerraron entre estas cuatro paredes blancas, 
Donde vienen a verme mis amigos 
De mes en mes, de dos en dos y de seis a siete.",De Cartón Piedra,1994
Joan Manuel Serrat,"Decir amigo 
es decir juegos, 
escuela, calle y niÃ±ez. 
Gorriones presos 
de un mismo viento 
tras un olor de mujer.
 
Decir amigo es decir vino, 
guitarra, trago y canciÃ³n 
furcias y broncas. 
Y en Los Tres Pinos

Decir amigo 
me trae del barrio 
luz de domingo

Decir amigo 
es decir aula,

Billar y cine. 
Siesta en Las Ramblas

Decir amigo es decir tienda,

Joan Manuel Serrat,"Tenía diez años y un gato 
Peludo, funámbulo y necio 
Que me esperaba en los alambres del patio 
A la vuelta del colegio. 
Tenía un balcón con albahaca 
Y un ejército de botones 
Y un tren con vagones de lata 
Roto entre dos estaciones. 

Tenía un cielo azul y un jardín de adoquines 
Y una historia a quemar temblándome en la piel. 
Era un bello jinete 
Sobre mi patinete 
Burlando cada esquina 
Como una golondrina 
Sin nada que olvidar 
Porque ayer aprendí a volar, 
Perdiendo el tiempo mirando el mar. 

Tenía una casa sombría 
Que madre vistió de ternura 
Y una almohada que hablaba y sabía 
De mis sueños de ser cura. 
Tenía un canario amarillo 
Que al viento trinaba sus penas 
Oyendo algún viejo organillo 
O mi radio de galena. 

Y en julio, en Aragón, tenía un pueblecillo, 
Una acequia, un establo y unas ruinas al sol. 
Al viento los ombligos 
Volaban cuatro amigos 
Picados de viruela 
Y huérfanos de escuela, 
Robando uva y maíz, 
Chupando caña y regaliz. 
Creo que entonces yo era feliz. 

Tenía cuatro sacramentos 
Y un ángel de la guarda amigo 
Y un ""Paris-Hollywood"" prestado y mugriento 
Escondido entre los libros. 
Tenía una novia morena 
Que abrió a la luna mis sentidos 
Jugando los juegos prohibidos 
A la sombra de una higuera. 

Crucé por la niñez imitando a mi hermano. 
Descerrajando el viento y apedreando al sol. 
Mi madre crió canas 
Pespunteando pijamas, 
Mi padre se hizo viejo 
Sin verse en el espejo, 
Y mi hermano se fue 
De casa, por primera vez. 

Y con quién?, y ¿dónde fue mi niñez?",Mi Niñez,1994
Joan Manuel Serrat,"La mujer que yo quiero, no necesita 
Bañarse cada noche en agua bendita
Tiene muchos defectos, dice mi madre
Y demasiados huesos, dice mi padre

Pero ella es más verdad que el pan y la tierra
Mi amor es un amor de antes de la guerra 
Para saberlo
La mujer que yo quiero, no necesita
Deshojar cada noche una margarita

La mujer que yo quiero, es fruta jugosa 
Prendida en mi alma como si cualquier cosa
Con ella quieren dármela mis amigos
Y se amargan la vida mis enemigos

Porque sin querer tú, te envuelve su arrullo 
Y contra su calor, se pierde el orgullo 
Y la vergüenza
La mujer que yo quiero, es fruta jugosa 
Madurando feliz, dulce y vanidosa

La mujer que yo quiero, me ató a su yunta
Para sembrar la tierra de punta a punta 
De un amor que nos habla con voz de sabio 
Y tiene de mujer la piel y los labios

Son todos suyos mis compañeros de antes
Mi perro, mi scalextric y mis amantes

No me llores, volveré 
Antes que 
De los sauces caigan las hojas
Piensa en mí 
Volveré a por ti""

Mi amante fiel, mi paz
Deja ya 
De tejer sueños en tu mente

nos envolvió el rumor suave del mar, 
tu cuerpo me dio calor, tenía frío, 
why allí, en la arena, entre los dos nació este poema, este pobre poema de amor para ti. 

Mi fruto, mi flor, mi historia de amor, mis caricias. 
Mi humilde candil, mi lluvia de abril, mi avaricia. Mi trozo de pan, mi viejo refrán, mi poeta. 
La fe que perdí, mi camino why mi carreta.
 Mi dulce placer, mi sueño de ayer, mi equipaje. 
Mi tibio rincón, mi mejor canción, mi paisaje.

Alcahuete noble
Que al oír los tiros
Recogió sus capas

Nos tocó ir de entierro
Pésames y flores

Yo soy ése por quin ahora

Perdiendo la vida, mimando su infancia, 
Velando su sueño, llorando su llanto 
Con tanta abundancia. 
Si cuando se abre una flor, 
Al olor de la flor, se le olvida a la flor.

Para un soñador de pelo largo, 
Qué le va usted a hacer señora.

Si en su reloj sonó la hora 
De abandonar su hogar, señora, 
En brazos de un desconocido 
Que sólo le dio un soplo de cupido 
Que no le hizo hermosa a fuerza de arrugas 
Y de años perdidos. 
Si cuando se abre una flor, 
Al olor de la flor se le olvida a la flor

Póngase usted un vestido viejo

Joan Manuel Serrat,"De aldea en aldea el viento lo lleva
Siguiendo el sendero
Su patria es el mundo
Como un vagabundo va el titiritero

Viene de muy lejos
Cruzando los viejos
Caminos de piedra

Es de aquella raza
Que de plaza en
Plaza
Nos canta su pena

¡Allez hop
¡Titiritero, allez hop
De feria en feria, siempre risueño
Canta sus sueños y sus miserias

Vacía su alforja
De sueños que forja
En su andar tan largo
Nos baja una estrella

Que borra la huella
De un recuerdo amargo
Canta su romanza
Al son de una danza

Híbrida y extraña
Para que el aldeano
Le llene la mano
Con lo poco que haya

¡Allez hop
¡Titiritero, allez hop
De feria en feria, siempre risueño
Canta sus sueños y sus miserias

Y al caer la noche
En el viejo coche
Guardará los chismes
Y tal como vino

Sigue su camino
Solitario y triste
Y quizá mañana
Por esa ventana

Que muestra el sendero
Nos llegue su queja
Mientras que se aleja
El titiritero

Joan Manuel Serrat,"No es que no vuelva porque me he olvidado 
De tu olor a tomillo y a cocina, 
De lejos, dicen que se ve más claro, 
Que no es igual quien anda y quien camina. 

Y supe que el amor tiene ojos verdes, 
Que cuatro palos tiene la baraja, 
Que nunca vuelve aquello que se pierde 
Y la marea sube y luego baja. 

Supe que lo sencillo no es lo necio, 
Que no hay que confundir valor y precio 
Y un manjar puede ser cualquier bocado. 

Si el horizonte es luz y el rumbo un beso, 
No es que no vuelva porque te he olvidado, 
Es que perdí el camino de regreso, mamá",Soneto a Mama,1994
Joan Manuel Serrat,"Boca que arrastra mi boca
Boca que me has arrastrado
Boca que vienes de lejos
A iluminarme de rayos

Alba que das a mis noches
Un resplandor rojo y blanco
Boca poblada de bocas
Pájaro lleno de pájaros

Canción que vuelve las alas
Hacia arriba y hacia abajo
Muerte reducida a besos
A sed de morir despacio
Das a la grama sangrante
Dos tremendos aletazos

El labio de arriba, el cielo
Y la tierra el otro labio

Beso que rueda en la sombra
Beso que viene rodando
Desde el primer cementerio
Hasta los últimos astros

Beso que va a un porvenir
De muchachas y muchachos
Que no dejarán desiertos
Ni las calles, ni los campos

¡Cuánta boca ya enterrada
Sin boca, desenterramos!

Bebo en tu boca por ellos
Brindo en tu boca por tantos
Que cayeron sobre el vino
De los amorosos vasos
Hoy son recuerdos, recuerdos
Besos distantes y amargos

Boca que desenterraste
El amanecer más claro
Con tu lengua tres palabras
Tres fuegos has heredado
Vida, muerte, amor ahí quedan
Escritas sobre tus labios

Alimentando lluvias, caracolas
Y órganos mi dolor sin instrumentos
A las desalentadas amapolas

Daré tu corazón por alimento
Tanto dolor se agrupa en mi costado
Que por doler, me duele hasta el aliento

Un hachazo invisible y homicida

Temprano madrugó la madrugada
Temprano está rodando por el suelo

No perdono a la muerte enamorada
No perdono a la vida desatenta
No perdono a la tierra ni a la nada

En mis manos levanto una tormenta
De piedras, rayos y hachas estridentes
Sedienta de catástrofes y hambrienta

Quiero escarbar la tierra con los dientes
Quiero apartar la tierra parte a parte
A dentelladas secas y calientes

Quiero mirar la tierra hasta encontrarte
Y besarte la noble calavera
Y desamordazarte y regresarte

Empieza a vivir, y empieza 
A morir de punta a punta,

En los huesos de la tierra. 

Contar sus años no sabe

Es una corona grave 
De sal para el labrador.

Masculinamente serio, 
Se unge de lluvias y se alhaja 
De carne de cementerio. 

A fuerza de golpes, fuerte, 
Y a fuerza de sol, bruñido, 
Con una ambición de muerte 
Despedaza un pan reñido. 

Cada nuevo día es 
Más raíz, menos criatura, 
Que escucha bajo sus pies 
La voz de la sepultura. 

Y como raíz se hunde 
En la tierra lentamente, 
Para que la tierra inunde 
De paz y panes su frente. 

Me duele este niño hambriento 
Como una grandiosa espina, 
Y su vivir ceniciento 
Revuelve mi alma de encina. 

Lo veo arar los rastrojos, 
Y devorar un mendrugo, 
Y declarar con los ojos 
Que por qué es carne de yugo. 

Me da su arado en el pecho, 
Y su vida en la garganta

Tan grande bajo su planta.

Menor que un grano de avena?

Celos de amor las clavijas,
Las cuerdas lazos de rabia,
Y relinchan impacientes
Por salir de serenata.

En los templados establos
Donde el amor huele a paja,
A honrado estiércol y a leche,
Hay un estruendo de vacas 
Que se enamoran a solas 
Y a solas rumian y braman. 

La cabra cambia de pelo, 
Cambia la oveja de lana, 
Cambia de color el lobo 
Y de raíces la grama. 

Son otras las intenciones
Y son otras las palabras
En la frente y en la lengua
De la juventud temprana.

Parecen de puro blancas 
Y las mañanas son miel 
De puro y puro doradas.

Y pare usted de contar
Hoy respiramos
Mañana dejamos 
De respirar

Despiértate benito se nos mojó la leña 
Y así no hay quien encienda un fuego decente
Baja crecido el río ya cubre hasta las peñas 
Tendremos que mudarnos bajo otro puente

¿sabes benito? anoche, tuve un sueño virguero
Me la pasé de charla y tomando copas 
En un sitio divino, con todo un caballero 
Y tú también venías benito y había sopa 

Y gambas y chuletas y alubias con chorizo 
Y café, copa y puro como en los buenos tiempos 
¿benito no me escuchas? ¿qué te pasa benito? 
No vayas a morirte. no me hagas eso

Y pare usted de contar

Mañana dejamos

Me ponga para siempre tus calcetines

Presagio de mala muerte
Niño silvestre 
Que acechando la acera viene y va

Niño de nadie 
Que buscándose la vida 
Desluce la avenida 
Y le da mala fama a la ciudad

Recién nacido 
Con la inocencia amputada 
Que en la manada 
Redime su pecado de existir

Niño sin niño 
Indefenso y asustado 
Que aprende a fuerza de palos 
Como las bestias a sobrevivir

Niño silvestre 
Lustrabotas y ratero 
Se vende a piezas o entero
Como onza de chocolate

Mientras el día la ronde 
Que por la noche se esconde 
Para que no le maten

Y si la suerte 
Por llamarlo de algún modo
Ahuyenta al lobo
Y le alarga la vida un poco más

Si el pegamento 
No le pudre los pulmones
Si escapa de los matones
Si sobrevive al látigo, quizás 

Llegue hasta viejo 
Entre cárceles y 'fierros' 
Sembrando el cerro 
De más niños silvestres, al azar

Y cualquier noche 
En un trabajo de limpieza 
Le vuele la cabeza 
A alguno de ellos, sin pestañear

Se han ido marchitando 
En casa. 

De nuestra casa 
Mi juventud se fue 
Corriendo tras tus pasos, 
Cruzando la ciudad, 
Mientras la soledad 
Me acuna entre sus brazos

Ya nadie enciende el fuego, 
Nadie llama a mi puerta, 
Las horas pasan muertas 
Sin tus manos. 

En nuestra casa, 
No soy más que una sombra

De golpe me hice viejo, 
Hablo con el espejo 
Y no abro los cajones
Por no encontrar recuerdos. 

De nuestra casa

Y volveré a vivir 
Lejos de las ventanas

Joan Manuel Serrat,"Jugando ayer desnudo por la arena 
Mi niñez poco a poco vi pasar, 
Se me escapó sin darme cuenta apenas, 
Soñando con volar. 

Irme jugando con el viento, 
Caer sobre el agua un momento. 
Crecí soñando, cerca del mar, 
Junto a las rocas, 
Un día aprendí a volar, 
Aprendí a volar 
Como mis gaviotas. 

Y me fui lejos de allí 
Aquel día, 
Sin mirar atrás creí 
Que jamás volvería. 

Me encontré un cardo, una flor, 
Un sueño, un amor, una tristeza, 
Me fui solo y luego fuimos dos, 
Un beso, un adiós y todo empieza. 

Otra canción, otra ilusión, otras cosas, 
Y harto ya de andar 
Hoy volví a buscar 
Mis gaviotas. 

Y no las vi, ellas también se fueron 
De aquel rincón que nos unió una vez, 
Me quedé solo, escarbando en el suelo, 
Buscando mi niñez. 

Ellas no ha de volver jamás, 
Ellas la dejaron atrás, 
Bajo la arena, cerca del mar, 
Junto a unas rocas 
Que no saben volar, 
Que no saben volar 
Como mis gaviotas. 

Y me voy más triste hoy 
Que aquel día, 
Que sin mirar atrás 
Creí que jamás volvería.",Mis Gaviotas,1994

Salario que no alcanza 
A fin de mes

Tú no andarás de rodillas 
Fregando pisos
No acabarás hecha un zarrio 
Como tu madre
Cansada de quitar mierda 
Y de parir hijos

De muertos de hambre

Cuando aparezcas 
En limusina 
A por esta vieja

Se ladeaba, se ladeaba, por el borde del fangal!
¡Pobre mina que nació en un conventillo
Con los pisos de ladrillo, el aljibe y el parral!

Alguien tiró la banana
Que ella pisó sin querer
Y justito cuando vi que se venía
Ya decúbito dorsal, me la agarré

Fui un gil
Porque creí que allí inventé el honor
Un gil
Que alzó un tomate y lo creyó una flor

Y sigo gil
Cuando presumo que salvé el amor
Ya que ella fue
Quien a trompadas me rompió las penas

Ya ven
Volví a la mugre de vivir tirao
¡Caray!
Si al menos me engrupiera de que la he salvao

Eso dijo el cusifai mientras la cosa
Retozaba, retozaba ya perdida en el fangal
Y él chupaba una ginebra desastrosa
Entre curdas y malandras en la mesa de aquel bar

Si alguien tiró la banana
El, que era un gil, la empujó
Y justito cuando vio que se venía
Ya decúbito dorsal, se le prendió

Fui un gil

Luna blanca en soledad
Prohibida entre las manzanas

Sabe que está dentro
De mis sueños, mi pecado original
Que me condena y me salva

Era la lluvia de madrugada cálida
Como un fogón era fiera como una
Pantera y suave como el algodón
Era siempre primavera

Se marcho, se fue por donde
Había venido y no volvió
Y me ha dejado con dos tazas de café

Y un papel que dice adiós
Y una foto de carnet
Y el alma llena de pena

Siempre me despierto
Por la noche no puedo dormir
Se me queda el alma en vela

Y sueño despierto
Con recuerdos que quieren salir
Tengo la memoria llena

Fue una noche negra prisionera de una
Cárcel de cristal y yo sigo preguntando
Pero nadie sabe dónde está
Nadie tiene la respuesta

Era la lluvia de madrugada cálida
Como un fogón era fiera como una
Pantera y suave como el algodón
Era siempre primavera

Se marcho, se fue por donde
Había venido y no volvió
Y me ha dejado con dos tazas de café

Y un papel que dice adiós
Y una foto de carnet
Y el alma llena de pena

Mayor de su potencia lunar y femenina
Eres la medianoche: la sombra culminante 
Donde culmina el sueño, donde el amor culmina

Daré sobre tu cuerpo cuando la noche arroje 
Su avaricioso anhelo de imán y poderío
Un astral sentimiento febril me sobrecoge
Incendia mi osamenta con un escalofrío

Pide que tú y yo ardamos fundiendo en la garganta

Veranos sin deberes 
Y el vaho del otoño en las ventanas

La casta de mi pueblo y la Susana 

Y cuando eché a rodar 
Con mi guitarra cantos de sirena 
Imaginaba un mar 
Donde mueren el Tajo, el Rhin y el Sena 
Zarpó el vapor al fin 
Huyendo de la siembra y de las siega 
Se parecía a mi 
El polizón oculto en la bodega 

Ay, ay, ay, ay

Lo que duran dos peces de hielo

Se vengaba, a través del olvido

Porque ya no le importa

Said don't get yourself in a sweat

""So don't get yourself in a snit, "" he said, 
""Tuck your tantrums into your kit instead 
""It's disarming to be charming,"" 
Quoth the medicine man, 
Whom all agree it's plain to see 
Nobody could be wiser than 

So if your temper's getting a top hand, 
All you have to do is just stop and 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Chattahoochee's, Chippewas do 

If you're feeling mad as a wet hen, 
Mad as you can possibly get, then 
Pass that peace pipe, bury that tomahawk 
Like those Chichamecks, Cherokees, 
Chapultepec's do 
That cold shoulder never solved a single complaint 
When you're older, you'll wipe off all of that war paint 

If you find yourself in a fury, 
Be your own judge and your own jury 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Chattahoochee's, Chippewas do 

If you want to hover out west, too, 
You will soon discover it's best to 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet

Chattanooga's, Cheekarohs do 

Even in colonial days, you 
Know the ceremonial ways to 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that tomahawk 
Like those Chakootamees, Chepacheps

When ""all clear""'s in, you'll be top man on the totem pole 

So, if you wanna be an all-right guy 
Not a long face, blues-in-the-night guy 
Write that apology and dispatch it! 
When you quarrel, it's grand to patch it! 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet

So do, do, do
What you've done, done, done
Before.

Sweets we've tasted before
Cannot stand an encore.
You know that a miss
Who always gives a kiss
Would soon become a bore.

True love never should pall.

Joan Morris,"All you preachers
Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.
It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;
Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practice,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go

[Chorus]
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day!
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way !
I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day.

Ev'ry new step
Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy ;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.
In time you'll get Saint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise ;
Let me give you advice.

Has given me a wonderful idea

Isn't it a pity we never met before!

You with the neighbours,
I at silly labours!
What joys untasted,
You readin Heine,
Me somewhere in China!

The charm about you

Joan Morris,"The weather is frightening.
The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way.

Will keep us together
So I can honestly say,
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.

If the skies are gray.
Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day.",Isn't This a Lovely Day,1988

They all love me
It's very lovely but

Oh! How I hate to get up in the morning
Oh! How I'd love to remain in bed

For the hardest blow of all 
Is to hear the bugler call
Ya gotta get up
Ya gotta get up
Ya gotta get up this morning

Someday I'm going to murder the bugler
Someday they're going to find him dead

I'll amputate his reveille
And step upon it heavily
And spend the rest of my life in bed

And I am blue
What'll I do?

What'll I do?

Is kissing you

To tell my troubles to?

You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid

Take your happiness while you may""

Your plane doesn't ever land 
Some things I don't want to look at 
I don't want to understand but 
You give me a ladder now 
I surely believe I'll climb 
It don't even matter now 
I'm willing to take my time 
I'm gonna love you anyway

Here comes my typical response 
Won't you tell me something I don't know

And you're pissed off about bein' the maid 
And how long till they shut off the phone 
Till the next time we get laid 
Let's just get naked

It's a trip and a half... 
A trip and a half 
We've been together so long 
I hope it wasn't just the drugs 
What happened to the energy we had 
The morning glories and the rodeo hugs 
And I know you like the back of my hand 
With a stamp that says I paid to get in 
And yes I am your television show 
And you're the nicest place I've ever been

Joan Osborne,"Crickets are chirpin' the water is high 
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hangin' dry 
Window's wide open African trees 
Bent over backwards in a hurricane breeze 
Not a word  a goodbye  not even a note 
She's gone with the man in the long black coat 
Somebody seem him hangin' around 
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town 
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask 
If he wanted to dance he had a face like a mask 
Somebody said, from the Bible he quote 
There was dust on the man in the long black coat 
Preacher was talkin' there's a sermon he gave 
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved 
You cannot depend on it to be your guide 
When it's you who must keep it satisfied 
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat 
She give her heart to the man in the long black coat 
One, two 
There are no mistakes in life some people say 
It's true sometimes you can see it that way 
People don't live or die, people just float 
She give her heart to the man in the long black coat 
There's smoke on the water, it's been there since June 
Tree trunks uprooted in the high crescent moon 
Hear the pulse and vibrations and the rumblin' force 
Somebody's out there beating on a dead horse 
She never said nothin', there was nothin' she wrote

In a trailer in the sand

And standing in the door 
He said  if you've come to take the car away 
I don't have it anymore 
I don't have it anymore 
He got the gospel on the radio 
And the gospel on TV 
He got all of the transcripts 
Back to 1963 
Back to 1963 

He said I sold my blood for money 
There wasn't any pain 

But I just can't stand the feeling

It's in someone else's veins

And she tried to change my mind

I saw her first and knew
That her dark hair would weave a snare
That I may one day rue.

I saw the danger, yet I walked
Along the enchanted way
And I said let grief be a falling leaf
At the dawning of the day.

On Grafton Street in November,
We tripped lightly along the ledge
Of a deep ravine where can be seen
The worst of passions pledged.

The Queen of Hearts still baking tarts
And I not making hay,
Well I loved too much; by such and such
Is happiness thrown away.

I gave her the gifts of the mind.
I gave her the secret sign
That's known to all the artists who have
Known true Gods of Sound and Time.

With word and tint I did not stint.
I gave her reams of poems to say
With her own dark hair and her own name there
Like the clouds over fields of May.

On a quiet street where old ghosts meet,
I see her walking now away from me,
So hurriedly. My reason must allow,
For I have wooed, not as I should

A creature made of clay.
When the angel woos the clay, he'll lose
His wings at the dawn of the day.",Raglan Road,1999
Joan Osborne,"Far between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken toll
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
An' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsakened
Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
An' the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

In the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
All down in taken-for-granted situations
Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute
For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chaineded an' cheated by pursuit
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended
Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing",Chimes of Freedom,1999

Ready to fly away, I need your gravity
When I run down the path
And if I lose my way
Your wind will call my name

Oh if I was
Oh if I was your man
Oh if I was 
Oh if I was your man

Let's go outside
To a dark place
Where the kitty cat hides
Put on your fake wings
Give the moon a ride

When you're lonely for the angel inside
3:30 in the morning is too early for you
But when it comes without a warning
What are you gonna do
This time?You gonna do this time?

Floating above you
Beyond the naked eye
Blue dreams about you
Come rushing through my mind
Branded with thoughts of you
They're tattooed on my soul
Why don't they seem to fade
Is what I'll never know

Oh if I was your man
Oh if I was

My love is alive

To dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met,
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing
Wild and free

To strangle me with its sweet taste
See God would never be so cruel
To make me like without your face
Now that I have made you crawl
It does you good to see me fall
Like poison apples from the tree
As heavy as a honey bee

Hallelujah
I gave you away so easily
It makes me wounder why

Moving through you every night
The lovely girls in dresses tight
The angels dancing on a pin
The people we are downing in 
Like a needle going  in
Oh I recall the moment when
You ruined me for other men

[Repeat]
Hallelujah
I gave you away so easily
It makes me wonder why
I don't know why

To drown you in a kiss

Meet up somewhere else

Off the night sky
You'll get it in a while

Amazed that you can stand up right

And if I sprouted wings
I would not be amazed

Rocks me for days and days and day and
I could be in the street
I could be on a train

In the pouring rain
Now there is not one place
That doesn't feel like home

Wrapped in swaddling clothes, the Prince of peace

Behold wise men journey from the East

How a little baby Boy bringing people so much joy?
Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight

A shepherd on a hillside, while over my flock I bide
On a cold winter night a band of angels sing
In a dream I heard a voice saying, ""Fear not, come rejoice
It's the end of the beginning, praise the new born King""

How a little baby Boy bringing people so much joy?
Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight

I saw it with my own eyes, written up in the skies
But why a simple herdsmen such as I
And then it came to pass, He was born at last
Right below the star that shines on high

Only you know and I know

'Cause you know that I mean what I say so don't go
And never take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on getting your own way
'Cause if you do, it's gonna get you someday, yeah.

We're both here to be pleasing
Oh no, not deceiving
But it's hard to believe in, aw yeah
When you've been so mistreated.

'Cause you know that I mean what I say so don't go
And never take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on getting your own way
'Cause if you do, it's gonna get you someday.

If I seem to mislead you
It's just my craziness coming through
But when it comes down to just two

Fare you well my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Are flown, except you alone

Going to leave this brokedown palace
On my hand and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time, in my time, I will roll, roll, roll

In a bed, in a bed, by the waterside
I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

River gonna take me, sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy all the way back home
It's a far gone lullaby, sung many years ago
Mama, mama many worlds I've come since I first left home

Goin' home, goin' home, by the waterside
I will rest my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

Going to plant a weeping willow
On the banks clean edge it will grow, grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go, the river roll, roll, roll

Fare you well, fare you well
I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

A weeping and a wailing how he's done her wrong?
That's one thing you'll never hear me say

Never gonna think that the man I lose
Is the only man among men
I'll snap my fingers to show I don't care
I'll buy me a brand new dress to wear
I'll scrub my neck and I'll brush my hair
And start all over again

[Chorus:]
Many a new face will please my eye
Many a new love will find me
Never have I once looked back to sigh
Over the romance behind me
Many a new day will dawn
Before I do

Many a light lad may kiss and fly
A kiss gone by is bygone
Never have I asked an August sky
Where has last July gone?
Never have I wandered through the rye
Wondering where has some guy gone
Many a new day will dawn
Before I do

I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you,
That look in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
And I know its true
That visions are seldom all they seem
But if i know you
I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once,like what you did once upon a dream.
Once upon a night,
I dreamed we'd be together
In love forever.

I was wishing for a never,
A never ending.

Feliz vivía Manuel Juárez
Arrendando sus caballos, cuidando su propiedades
Trabajando bien sus tierras
Poco sale a las ciudades
Bonita estaba su chata
Estaban recién casados
Vivían en casa de adobe
Pero bien enamorados

La feria del cuarto viernes, señores
Se celebraba en el pueblo
Cerca de semana santa
Pero andaba suelto el diablo

Manuel ensilla una yegua
También su potro más fino
Con su sonrisa y su prieta
Con rumbo al pueblo se vino
¡Caramba! ¡qué mala pata! ¡Qué jugada del destino!
Un tipo grita en la calle: ¡ay que re chulas caderas!
No se refería a la yegua
Y esas si son tiznaduras

Manuel le dio vuelta al potro
El otro sacó pistola
Juárez es herido de un brazo
El otro muerto hecho bola
En las patas del caballo que Manuel Juárez adora

Testigos hubo del caso
Y aunque a Manuel apresaron
Luego de averiguaciones, en libertad lo dejaron
Mientras que calladamente al hocican sepultaron
Y en un ranchito en la sierra, allá vive Manuel Juárez
Con sus hijos y su prieta
Tiene pocas amistades
Trabaja cuacos y tierras, ya no baja a la ciudades

Hay que respetar su esposa",Manuel Juarez,1995

Lo que ahora tengo es lo que me merezco

Pero si llega sera bien recibida
Espero diga que eres una fiesta

Sé que cambiaste tu número de teléfono
Y sé que cambiaste hasta el color de tu pelo
Porque empiezas una nueva vida sin mi
Sabes amor, deseo que encuentres toda la felicidad
Que yo soñaba poder darte
No lo logré, perdóname

Sé que te marchaste sin saber
Sin escuchar, sin comprender
Que hay una daga envenenada aquí en mi pecho
El mal ya está hecho, ahora

Sé que no merezco tu perdón
Que lastime tu corazón
Hoy me avergüenzo fui el motivo de tu llanto
Queriéndote tanto, pues
Te amo, te amo
Soy un idiota te perdí, pero te amo
Te amo, te amo
Soy un idiota te perdí, pero te amo

No, no puedo exigir que me perdones
Mis errores son graves y es muy duro
Caminé por la senda equivocada
Cuando me diste amor, ese amor puro
Hoy no sirven de nada mis pregones
Cuando quise volver ya era muy tarde
Caminé por la senda equivocada
Y te hice llorar, soy un cobarde

Sé que otro amor encontrarás
Que te de luz, que te de paz
Que te de todo lo que yo no supe darte
Quisiera abrazarte, pero
Se que no merezco tu perdón
Que lastimé tu corazón
Y hoy naufrago en este mar de tu abandono
Ni yo me perdono, y

Te amo, te amo
Soy un idiota te perdí, pero te amo

Que te fuiste con ese infeliz 
Qué importa (cómo dice, cómo dice), qué importa 
Que me va a matar la depresión 
Quevoy a vivir en el alcohol 
Qué importa, qué importa (díselo)
Que te fuiste sin decir adiós 
Que no dormirás en mi colchón 
Qué importa (cómo dice, cómo) qué importa 
Que ensuciaste mi reputación 
Que te vale madres este amor 
Qué importa (qué importa), qué importa 
 
Que te quise demasiado 
Y que nadie te ha querido como yo

Que me hará justicia la nación

Y que nadie te ha querido como yo

On my own

My hat from my glove

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty,2005

A million or more times?
You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you

I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now

We looked at each other in the same way then

The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Seem to be happening again

And laughed before, and loved before

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1996

If your heart is in your dream

Joan Sutherland,"Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen,
When the snow lay round about,
Deep and crisp and even.
Brightly shown the moon that night,
Though the frost was cruel,
When a poor man came in sight,
Gathering winter fuel.

Hither, page, and stand by me.
If thou know it telling:
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain,
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.
Bring me pine logs hither.
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear the thither.
Page and monarch, forth they went,
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.

Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind blows stronger.
Fails my heart, I know not how.
I can go no longer.
Ark my footsteps my good page,
Tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's step he trod,
Where the snow lay dented.
Heat was in the very sod
Which the saint had printed.
Therefore, Christian men, be sure,
Wealth or rank possessing,
Ye who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing","Good King Wenceslas (Piae Cantiones, 1582)",2004

A little Nash Rambler was following me, about one-third my size.

As he kept on tooting his horn. Beep! Beep!
I'll show him that a Cadillac is not a car to scorn.

Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)

I couldn't believe my eyes.
The little Nash Rambler was right behind, you'd think that guy could fly.

Say to you, to say to you.

I wish that I could never be in 
Front of you, in front of you.

You say that you never believed.
You say that it's done.

Through the rain, the rhythm of the rain

Falling down in every way and letting go of
Memories, they float away, far away.
Trying hard to keep them mine,
When something's gone you 
Never can go home again, home again.

Don't stop down, the way to breathing.
Don't stop down, the way to breathing.

Always hear when you sigh

In a phrase how I feel

Bill and coo when they love?

He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

Met the divine Miss O

I've got to go away - but baby it's cold outside 
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in 
So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice 

My mother will start to worry - Beautiful words you're humming 
And father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar 
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry 
Well, maybe just a half a drink more - Put some records on while I pour 

The neighbors might think - But baby it's bad out there 
Say, what's in this drink? - No cabs to be had out there 
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now 
To break the spell - I'll take your hat, your hairs looks swell 

I ought to say no, no, no sir - Mind if I move in closer? 
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense of hurting my pride? 
I really can't stay - Oh baby don't hold out 
Ah but it's cold outside - Baby it's cold outside 

I simply must go - But baby it's cold outside 
The answer is no -But baby it's cold outside

So nice and warm - Look out that window at that storm

My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon a tropical shore 
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Gosh your lips are delicious 
Well, maybe just a cigarette more -Never such a blizzard before 

I got to get home - But baby you'd freeze out there 
Say, lend me a coat - It's up to your knees out there 
You've really been grand - I'm thrilled when you touch my hand 
Why don't you see - How can you do this thing to me? 

There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Think of my lifelong sorrow

I lie here beside you, just watching you sleep, 
And sometimes I whisper, what I`m thinking of, 
My cup runneth over with love . . . 
 
Sometimes in the evening, when you do not see, 
I study the small things, you do constantly, 
I memorize moments, that I`m fondest of, 
My cup runneth over with love . . . 
 
In only a moment, we both will be old, 
We won`t even notice the world turning cold. 
And so, in this moment, with sunlight above,

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2009

As I stop to look around
And Your loveliness invokes me to bow down, bow down

All my failed dreams and regrets

And I see You standing there, my dwelling place

Think of me

Trying your best to put your life in order
Thoughts of the past grip tightly and they won't let you go
You feel so bad and it seems you just can't face me
And all the time you wear a smile, it's just for show, think of me

Keep your heart straight aimed in my direction
And the pain that troubles you will have to leave
I'll shower you with pure love and affection
I'm the one that can give you what you need

When life moves at a crazy pace
And your hopes and dreams seem to wash away
When your options seem to dissipate
Turn your heart and simply think of me

I'm the one who cares
I'll lift you from your deep despair
What's shattered, I can make it whole
Take the time, think of me

When it's hard and your strength is failing
You're trying to hold, hold on to what you know is real
Tears that fall have now become too common
I'm the one who understands most how you feel, think of me

Stay with me and in that become much closer
And when the water's rough
Count on me to safely guide you through
Peace of mind is real not just a notion
But count on me to give it all to you

Hold my hand and just believe my word you'll find is true
There's rest for you where the green pastures grow
And when you think of me you'll find I'm not so far away
I will faithfully lead you where still waters flow
Keep your thoughts on me

When life moves at a crazy pace
And your hopes and dreams seem to wash away
When your options seem to dissipate
Turn your heart and simply think of me

I'm the one who cares
I'll lift you from your deep despair
What's shattered, I can make it whole
Keep your mind on me, think of me

When your options seem to dissipate

Take the time

When life moves at a crazy pace
And your hopes and dreams seem to wash away
When your options seem to dissipate
Turn your heart and simply think of me

I danced in your shade
But my smile hid the pain
And I stored it away

As your credits rolled by
I stood as your prize
But I was cravin' so much more
Oh, I was wastin' away

Tell me why, tell me why
Is it easier to hurt myself?
Than to simply say

I don't love you, I don't want you
I don't need you to understand
Sayin' you love me, makes it too easy
You can't fix me this time

'Cause I'm broken

But it was burnin' a hole

And I've been, take me down

A pretty face
All the years it finally took to see this pretty face
After listening to the world tell me who I should be
Oh, I let it feed on my insecurities

See the world is mean
And if you let it, it will make you think
That everything has to look a certain way

But that's not how it is
You see, I got a gift
That the world can't change or take away

I found that through it all
That I'm one of a kind
And what God has given me
I'm gonna let it shine, hey

Just look a little deeper and you'll see
All the beauty waiting here inside of me
Don't let what's on the outside go and trick your eyes
And catch you by surprise

Yeah, 'cause I, I'm every woman that has ever been
So if you're deep enough to see what's underneath my skin
I just might let you in and then you just might win

Now the hurt is gone
But when it was there its purpose was to make me strong
And I guess that's why heaven sent it down to me
Oh, so I could see I have everything inside to be complete

So next time that you're tempted just to walk on by
It might be worth your time to stop and stay a while, hey

Just look a little deeper and you'll see

When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!

Scorned by the ones he came to save
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied 
For every sin on him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

There in the ground his body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave he rose again!
And as he stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am his and he is mine 
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me

Joanna Newsom,"The meadowlark and the chim-choo-ree and the sparrow
Set to the sky in a flying spree,
for the sport over the pharaoh
A little while later the Pharisees dragged comb through the meadow
Do you remember what they called up to you and me, in our window?

There is a rusty light on the pines tonight
Sun pouring wine, lord, or marrow
Down into the bones of the birches
And the spires of the churches
Jutting out from the shadows
The yoke, and the axe, and the old smokestacks and the bale and the barrow
And everything sloped like it was dragged from a rope
In the mouth of the south below

We've seen those mountains kneeling, felten and grey
We thought our very hearts would up and melt away
From that snow in the night time
Just going
And going
And the stirring of wind chimes
In the morning
In the morning
Helps me find my way back in
From the place where I have been

And, Emily, I saw you last night by the river
I dreamed you were skipping little stones across the surface of the water
Frowning at the angle where they were lost, and slipped under forever,
In a mud-cloud, mica-spangled, like the sky'd been breathing on a mirror

Anyhow, I sat by your side, by the water
You taught me the names of the stars overhead that I wrote down in my ledger
Though all I knew of the rote universe were those pleiades loosed in December
I promised you I'd set them to verse so I'd always remember

That the meteorite is a source of the light
And the meteor's just what we see
And the meteoroid is a stone that's devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee

And the meteorite's just what causes the light
And the meteor's how it's perceived
And the meteoroid's a bone thrown from the void that lies quiet in offering to thee

You came and lay a cold compress upon the mess I'm in
Threw the window wide and cried, Amen! Amen! Amen!
The whole world stopped to hear you hollering
You looked down and saw now what was happening

The lines are fadin' in my kingdom
Though I have never known the way to border 'em in
So the muddy mouths of baboons and sows and the grouse and the horse and the hen
Grope at the gate of the looming lake that was once a tidy pen
And the mail is late and the great estates are not lit from within
The talk in town's becoming downright sickening

In due time we will see the far butte lit by a flare
I've seen your bravery, and I will follow you there
And row through the night time
So healthy
Gone healthy all of a sudden
In search of the midwife
Who could help me
Who could help me
Help me find my way back in
There are worries where I've been

Say, say, say in the lee of the bay, don't be bothered
Leave your troubles here where the tugboats shear the water from the water
Flanked by furrows, curling back, like a match held up to a newspaper
Emily, they'll follow your lead by the letter
And I make this claim, and I'm not ashamed to say I knew you better
What they've seen is just a beam of your sun that banishes winter

Let us go! though we know it's a hopeless endeavor
The ties that bind, they are barbed and spined and hold us close forever
Though there is nothing would help me come to grips with a sky that is gaping and yawning
There is a song I woke with on my lips as you sailed your great ship towards the morning

Come on home, the poppies are all grown knee-deep by now
Blossoms all have fallen, and the pollen ruins the plow
Peonies nod in the breeze and while they wetly bow, with
Hydrocephalitic listlessness ants mop up-a their brow

And everything with wings is restless, aimless, drunk and dour
The butterflies and birds collide at hot, ungodly hours
And my clay-colored motherlessness rangily reclines
Come on home, now! all my bones are dolorous with vines

Pa pointed out to me, for the hundredth time tonight
The way the ladle leads to a dirt-red bullet of light
Squint skyward and listen
Loving him, we move within his borders
Just asterisms in the stars' set order

We could stand for a century
Starin'
With our heads cocked
In the broad daylight at this thing
Joy
Landlocked
In bodies that don't keep
Dumbstruck with the sweetness of being
Till we don't be
Told, take this
Eat this

Told, the meteorite is the source of the light
And the meteor's just what we see
And the meteoroid is a stone that's devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee

And the meteorite's just what causes the light
And the meteor's how it's perceived
And the meteoroid's a bone thrown from the void that lies quiet in offering to thee",Emily,2006

Reverent for what I represent to show my benevolence
This is Dilly; I'm reppin' for the art of the city
Came from Southwest Atlantic and gave my heart to the city
Where slugs fly, thugs cry 'cause every part of it's gritty
Niggas shootin' up the club like they party with Diddy
You pick the diggy; I put my incandescence to fluorescence
And an essence I convert with (?) for energy per second

Joanna Newsom,"The diver is my love
And I am his, if I am not deceived
Who takes one breath above for every hour below the sea

Who gave to me a jewel
Worth twice this woman's life, though it cost her less
Than laying at low tide to see her true love phosphoresce

And in an infinite regress
Tell me why is the pain of birth
Lighter borne than the pain of death?
I can't claim that I loved you first
But I loved you best

I know we must abide
Each by the rules that bind us here:
The divers and the sailors and the women on the pier

And how do you choose your form?
How do you choose your name? How do you choose your life?
How do you choose the time you must exhale and kick and rise?

And in an infinite capsize
Like a boat tearing down the coast
Double hulls bearing double masts
I don’t know if you loved me most
But you loved me last

Recall the word you gave
To count your way across the depths of this arid world
Where you will yoke the waves that lay a bed of shining pearls

I dream it every night
The ringing of the pail, the motes of sand dislodged, the shucking, quick and bright
The twinned and cast off shells reveal a single heart of white

And in an infinite backslide
Ancient boulders sink past the west
Like a sword at the bearer's fall
I can't claim that I knew you best
But did you know me at all?

A woman is alive, a woman is alive
You do not take her for a siren
An anchor on a stone, alone, unfaceted and fine

And never will I wed
I'll hunt the pearl of death to the bottom of my life
And ever hold my breath 'til I may be the diver's wife

See how the infinite divides
And the divers are not to blame
For the rift spanning distant shores
You don’t know my name
But I know yours",Divers,2015
Joanna Newsom,"If I had the space of half a day
I'm ashamed of half the things I say
I'm ashamed to have turned out this way
Well I desire to make amends

But it don't make no difference now
And no one's listening anyhow
And lists of sins and a solemn vow
Can't make you any friends

There's an old trick played when the light and the wine
Conspire to make me think I'm fine
I'm not but I have got half a mind
To maybe get there yet

When the sky goes pink in Paris, France

Do you think of the girl who used to dance
When you'd frame her moving within your hands
Saying this I won't forget

What happened to the man you were
When you loved somebody before her
Did you die or does that man endure
Somewhere far away?

And we carry them like a pack of cards
Some we don't use but we don't discard
And we keep for a rainy day",Goose Eggs,2015
Joanna Newsom,"Hay and a clean stall
And ivy on a garden wall
And a sign saying sold
And an old coat for the bad cold

I believe in you
Do you believe in me?
What do you want to do?
Are we leaving the city?

On the black road
Through the gold fields
While the fiends are plowed
Towards what we are allowed

The bridle bends in idle hands
And slows your canter to a trot
We mean to stop in increments
But can’t commit, we post and sit in impotence

The harder the hit, the deeper the dent
We seek our name, we seek out fame
In our credentials, paned in glass
Trying to master incidentals

Bleach a collar, leech a dollar
From our cents
The longer you live, the higher the rent
Beneath a pale sky
Beside the red barn
Below the white clouds
Is all we are allowed

Here, the light will seep
And the scythe will reap
And spirit will rend
In counting toward the end

In December of that year
The word came down that she was here
The days were shorter
I was sure if she came round
I’d hold my ground

I can do what they alluded to
A change that came to pass
And spring did range, weeping grass
And sleepless broke
Itself upon my winter glass

And I could barely breathe for seeing
All the splintered light that leaked
A fish is fleeting, launched in flight
Unstaunched daylight, brightly bleeding
Bleached the night with dawn deleting
In that high sun after our good run
When the spirit bends
Beneath knowing it must end

And that is all I want here
To draw my gaunt spirit to bow
Beneath what I am allowed
Beneath what I am allowed",Leaving the City,2015
Joanna Newsom,"My life comes and goes
My life comes and goes
Short flight, free rows
I lie down and doze

My life came and went
My life came and went
Short flight, free descent
Poor flight attendant

But the sky, over the ocean
And the ocean, skirting the city
And the city, bright as a garde
(When the garden woke to meet me)
From that height was a honeycomb
Made of light from those funny homes, intersected
Each enclosed, anelectric and alone

In our lives is a common sense
That relies on the common fence
That divides, and attends
But provides scant defense
From the great light that shine through a pin-hole
When the pin-light calls itself selfhood
And the selfhood inverts on a mirror
In an Amora Obscura

But it's mine
Or, at least, it's lent
And my life, until the time is spent
Is a pin-light, bent
It's a pin-light, bent",A Pin-Light Bent,2015
Joanna Newsom,"It's the same old lady, putting out the wash
Standing in the rain, in her mackintosh
Same old lady standing in the rain

Hey little leaf, lying on the ground
Now you're turning slightly brown
Why don't you get up on the tree
Turn the color green the way you ought to be

My mind is failing and my body grows weak
My lips won't form the words I speak
I'm floating away on a barrel of pain
New York City won't see me again

It's the same old man, sitting by the mill
Mill-wheel turning of its own free will
I'm certainly glad to be home
New York City continues on alone",Same Old Man,2015
Joanna Newsom,"The cause is Ozymandian
The map of Sapokanikan
Is sanded and bevelled
The land lone and levelled
By some unrecorded and powerful hand

Which plays along the monument
And drums upon a plastic bag
The brave-men-and-women-so-dear-to-God-
And-famous-to-all-of-the-ages rag

Sang: Do you love me?
Will you remember?
The snow falls above me
The renderer renders:
The event is in the hand of God

Beneath a patch of grass, her
Bones the old Dutch master hid
While elsewhere Tobias
And the angel disguise
What the scholars surmise was a mother and kid

Interred with other daughters
In dirt in other potters' fields
Above them, parades
Mark the passing of days
Through parks where pale colonnades arch in marble and steel

Where all of the twenty-thousand attending your footfall
And the causes they died for are lost in the idling bird calls
And the records they left are cryptic at best
Lost in obsolescence
The text will not yield, nor x-ray reveal
With any fluorescence
Where the hand of the master begins and ends

I fell, I tried to do well but I won't be
Will you tell the one that I love to remember and hold me
I call and call for the doctor
But the snow swallows me whole with ol' Florry Walker
And the event lives only in print

He said:
""It's alright""
And ""It's all over now""
And boarded the plane
His belt unfastened
The boy was known to show unusual daring
And, called a ""boy""
This alderman, confounding Tammany Hall
In whose employ King Tamanend himself preceeded John’s fall

So we all raise a standard
To which the wise and honest soul may repair
To which a hunter
A hundred years from now, may look and despair
And see with wonder
The tributes we have left to rust in the parks
Swearing that our hair stood on end
To see John Purroy Mitchel depart

For the Western front where our work might count
O mercy! O God!
Go out, await the hunter to decipher the stone
And what lies under the city is gone

Look and despair
Look and despair",Sapokanikan,2015
Joanna Newsom,"If I have the space of half a day
I'm ashamed of half the things I say
I'm ashamed to have turned out this way
And I desire to make amends

But it don't make no difference, now
And no one's listening, anyhow
And lists of sins and solemn vows
Don't make you any friends

There's an old trick played
When the light and the wine conspire
To make me think I'm fine
I'm not, but I have got half a mind
To maybe get there, yet

When the sky goes pink in Paris, France
Do you think of the girl who used to dance
When you'd frame her moving within your hands
Saying this I won't forget?

What happened to the man you were
When you loved somebody before her?
Did he die?
Or does that man endure, somewhere far away?

Our lived come easy and our lives come hard
We carry them like a pack of cards
Some we don't use, but we don't discard
But keep for a rainy day",The Things I Say,2015
Joanna Newsom,"Time passed hard
And the task was the hardest thing she'd ever do
But she forgot
The moment she saw you

So it would seem to be true
When cruel birth debases, we forget
When cruel death debases
We believe it erases all the rest
that precedes

But stand brave, life-liver
Bleeding out your days
In the river of time
Stand brave
Time moves both ways

In the nullifying, defeating, negating, repeating
Joy of life
The nullifying, defeating, negating, repeating
Joy of life

The moment of your greatest joy sustains
Not axe nor hammer
Tumor, tremor
Can take it away, and it remains
It remains

And it pains me to say, I was wrong
Love is not a symptom of time
Time is just a symptom of love

(And the nullifying, defeating, negating, repeating
Joy of life
The nullifying, defeating, negating, repeating
Joy of life)

Hardly seen, hardly felt
Deep down where your fight is waiting
Down 'till the light in your eyes is fading
Joy of life
Where I know that you can yield, when it comes down to it
Bow like the field when the combs through it
Joy of life
And every little gust that chances through
Will dance in the dust of me and you
With joy of life
And in our perfect secret-keeping
One ear of corn
In silent, reaping
Joy of life

Joy
Again, around–a pause, a sound–a song
A way a lone a last a loved a long
A cave, a grave, a day: arise, ascend
(Areion, Rharian, go free and graze
Amen)

A shore, a tide, unmoored–a sight, abroad
A dawn, unmarked, undone, undarked (a god)
No time, no flock, no chime, no clock, no end
White star, white ship nightjar, transmit, transcend

White star, white ship–nightjar, transmit, transcend

Joanna Newsom,"I believed they had got what they came for
I believed our peril was done
On the eve of the last of the great wars
After three we had narrowly won
(But the fourth
It was carelessly done)

I saw his ship in its whistling ascension
As they launched from the capitol seat
Swear I saw our mistake
When the clouds draped like a flag
Across the backs of the fleet
Of the hundred-first lightborne elite

As the day is long
So the well runs dry
And we came to see time is taller
Than space is wide
And we bade goodbye
To the great divide
Found unlimited simulacreage to colonize

But there was a time we were lashed to the prow
Of a ship you may board, but not steer
Before you and I ceased to mean now
And began to mean only right here
(to mean inches and miles, but not years)
Before space has a taste of its limits
And a new sort of coordinate awoke
Making time just another poor tenant
Bearing weight, taking fire, trading smokes
In the war between us and our ghosts

(But I saw the Bering Strait and the Golden Gate
In silent suspension of their golden age
And you can barely tell, if I guard it well
Where I have been, and seen
Pristine, unfelled)

I had a dream that I walked in the garden
Of Chabot, and those telescope ruins
It was there that I called to my true love
Who was pale as millennial moons
Honey, where did you come by that wound?

When I woke, he was gone
And the war had begun
In eternal return and repeat
Calling, where in the hell are the rest of your fellow
One hundred-one lightborne elite?
Stormed in the new highland light infantry

Make it stop, my love
We were wrong to try
Never saw what we could unravel
In traveling light
Nor how the trip debrides
Like a stack of slides
All we saw was that time is taller than space is wide

That's why we are bound to a round desert island
'neath the sky where our sailors have gone
Have they drowned, in those windy highlands?
Highlands away, my John",Waltz of the 101st Lightborne,2015
Joanna Newsom,"And what do you remember most?
The line of the sea, seceding the coast?
Fine capillaries, glowing with cars?
The comfort you drew from the light of the stars?

And how long did you climb that night
With the ice in your lungs, on the rungs of the light?
Beyond recall, you severed all strings
To everyone, and everything

Oh, silent, constant driver of mine
Wordlessly calling from the end of the line
Where, even though each hour I ever loved
Must queue and dive
Still, you will not take my heart, alive

In martial wind, and in clarion rain
We minced into battle, wincing in pain
Not meant for walking, backs bound in twine
Not angel or devil
But level, in time

And I rose, to take my shape at last
From the dreams that had dogged me, through every past
When, to my soul, the body would say
You may do what you like
As long as you stay

Now the towns and forests, highways and plains
Fall back in circles like an emptying drain
And I won't come round this way again
Where the lonely wind abides
And you will not take my heart, alive
You will not take my heart",You Will Not Take My Heart Alive,2015

In the album of my memory

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye

Love is now the stardust of yesterday

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

Joanne and Friends,"She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati on a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her mama and her daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go, and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind, and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm on

And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Beware my foolish heart

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Joanne Shenandoah,"When the Creator made the earth
All kinds of trees were planted
The maple, birch, oak, hickory, apple, pear
And nut trees and so on

The Creator had to tend to other worlds
So He asked the trees to watch over the earth
All trees promised they would watch over the land

The trees waited and waited
For the Creator's return
They waited many days
And they waited many nights

The trees began to get tired
And they started to fall asleep
They forgot the promise
They had given the Creator

Only the evergreens remained awake
Keeping watch over the earth
When the Creator returned
Only the evergreen trees were still awake

As a reminder to everyone to keep their word
During every fall and winter
All the trees lose their leaves
Except the evergreen trees

Came to us looking for bread and corn

Who clothed his back? A bear woman was good

Took care of the old man all day and night

Okwari, all across the land
Okwari, you gave and gave
Okwari, the lives you'll save

Each day a new sickness befell the old man
He hold her to gather plants in her hand
To give thanks and an offering
Little lights now a healer of the Bear Clan

She gathered all people around the old man
To show them the healing, the plants in her hand
Everyone listened and wanted to know
The gift she was given and just where to go

Because she learned, all healing began

Com tanta gente que partiu num rabo-de-foguete
Chora a nossa pátria, mãe gentil
Choram Marias e Clarices no solo do Brasil
Mas sei, que uma dor assim pungente
Não há de ser inutilmente, a esperança
Dança na corda bamba de sombrinha
E em cada passo dessa linha pode se machucar
Azar, a esperança equilibrista
Sabe que o show de todo artista tem que continuar",O Bêbado E a Equilibrista,1999
João Bosco,"Eu não sei seu nome inteiro
Nem de onde você veio
Não conheço que cabelo
Você tem antes do espelho
E o que pensa sua boca
Por trás do batom vermelho
Qual a placa do seu carro
Os seus sonhos de menina
A marca do seu cigarro
Seus silêncios, sua sina
Pra que porto você ruma
Suas âncoras, seu medo
Se dormiu com meu futuro
Ou querendo partir cedo
Eu não sei qual o seu signo
Se prefere outros assuntos
De que filmes você gosta
Quanto tempo temos juntos",Eu Não Sei Seu Nome Inteiro,2003
João Bosco,"Canta Canta, minha Gente
Deixa a tristeza pra lá
Canta forte, canta alto
Que a vida vai melhorar
Que a vida vai melhorar
Que a vida vai melhorar
Que a vida vai melhorar
Que a vida vai melhorar

Cantem o samba de roda
O samba-canção e o samba rasgado
Cantem o samba de breque
O samba moderno e o samba quadrado

Cantem ciranda, o frevo
O côco, maxixe, baião e xaxado
Mas não cantem essa moça bonita
Porque ela está com o marido do lado

Canta Canta, minha gente
Deixa a tristeza pra lá
Canta forte, canta alto
Que a vida vai melhorar
Que a vida vai melhorar
Que a vida vai melhorar
Mas a vida vai melhorar
A vida vai melhorar

Quem canta seus males espanta
Lá em cima do morro
Ou sambando no asfalto
Eu canto o samba-enredo
Um sambinha lento e um partido alto

Há muito tempo não ouço
O tal do samba sincopado
Só não dá pra cantar mesmo
É vendo o sol nascer quadrado

Canta Canta, minha gente
Deixa a tristeza pra lá
Canta forte, canta alto
Que a vida vai melhorar

Que a vida vai melhorar
Que a vida vai melhorar
Mas eu disse: Que vai melhorar
Que a vida vai melhorar
Ora se vai melhorar
Que a vida vai melhorar
Mas será que vai melhorar?
Que a vida vai melhorar
Eu já vou é me mandar
Que a vida vai melhorar
Que a vida vai melhorar","Canta, Canta, Minha Gente",2014
Joao Castilho,"Um cantinho e um violão
Este amor, uma canção
Pra fazer feliz a quem se ama

Muita calma pra pensar
E ter tempo pra sonhar

Da janela vê-se o Corcovado
O Redentor que lindo

Quero a vida sempre assim com você perto de mim
Até o apagar da velha chama

E eu que era triste
Descrente deste mundo
Ao encontrar você eu conheci
O que é felicidade meu amor

O que é felicidade, o que é felicidade",Corcovado (Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars),2009
João Donato,"Oi, coração
Não dá pra falar muito não
Espera passar o avião
Assim que o inverno passar
Eu acho que vou te buscar
Aqui tá fazendo calor
Deu pane no ventilador
Já tem fliperama em Macau
Tomei a costeira em Belém do Pará
Puseram uma usina no mar
Talvez fique ruim pra pescar
Meu amor

No Tocantins
O chefe dos parintintins
Vidrou na minha calça Lee
Eu vi uns patins pra você
Eu vi um Brasil na tevê
Capaz de cair um toró
Estou me sentindo tão só
Oh, tenha dó de mim
Pintou uma chance legal
Um lance lá na capital
Nem tem que ter ginasial
Meu amor

No Tabariz
O som é que nem os Bee Gees
Dancei com uma dona infeliz
Que tem um tufão nos quadris
Tem um japonês trás de mim
Eu vou dar um pulo em Manaus
Aqui tá quarenta e dois graus
O sol nunca mais vai se pôr
Eu tenho saudades da nossa canção
Saudades de roça e sertão
Bom mesmo é ter um caminhão
Meu amor

Baby, bye bye
Abraços na mãe e no pai
Eu acho que vou desligar
As fichas já vão terminar
Eu vou me mandar de trenó
Pra Rua do Sol, Maceió
Peguei uma doença em Ilhéus
Mas já tô quase bom
Em março vou pro Ceará
Com a benção do meu orixá
Eu acho bauxita por lá
Meu amor

Bye bye, Brasil
A última ficha caiu
Eu penso em vocês night and day
Explica que tá tudo okay
Eu só ando dentro da lei
Eu quero voltar, podes crer
Eu vi um Brasil na tevê
Peguei uma doença em Belém
Agora já tá tudo bem
Mas a ligação tá no fim
Tem um japonês trás de mim
Aquela aquarela mudou
Na estrada peguei uma cor
Capaz de cair um toró
Estou me sentindo um jiló
Eu tenho tesão é no mar
Assim que o inverno passar
Bateu uma saudade de ti
Tô a fim de encarar um siri
Com a benção de Nosso Senhor
O sol nunca mais vai se pôr","Bye, Bye Brasil",
