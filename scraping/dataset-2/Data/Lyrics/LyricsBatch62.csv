Cicero Blake,"I've really got to use my imagination
To think of good reasons 
To keep on keepin' on

Got to make the best of a bad situation
Ever since that day 
I woke up and found
That you were gone

Darkness all around me 
Blackin out the sun
Old friends call me
But I just don't feel like talkin to anyone

Emptiness has found me
And it just wont let me go
I go right on livin'
But why I just don't know

Staring down reality
Don't do me no good
'Cause our misunderstanding
Is too well understood

Such a sad, sad season
When a good love dies.
Not a day goes by
When I don't realize

I've really got to use my imagination
To think of good reasons
To keep on keepin' on

Got to make the best of a bad situation
Ever since that day
I woke up and found
That you were gone
",I've Got to Use My Imagination,1988
Cícero Nunes,"O mar serenou quando ela pisou na areia
Quem samba na beira do mar é sereia

O pescador não tem medo
É segredo se volta ou se fica no fundo do mar
Ao ver a morena bonita sambando
Se explica que não vai pescar
Deixa o mar serenar

O mar serenou quando ela pisou na areia
Quem samba na beira do mar é sereia

A lua brilhava vaidosa
De si orgulhosa e prosa com que deus lhe deu
Ao ver a morena sambando
Foi se acabrunhando então adormeceu o sol apareceu

O mar serenou quando ela pisou na areia
Quem samba na beira do mar é sereia

Um frio danado que vinha
Do lado gelado que o povo até se intimidou
Morena aceitou o desafio Sambou
E o frio sentiu seu calor e o samba se esquentou

O mar serenou quando ela pisou na areia
Quem samba na beira do mar é sereia

A estrela que estava escondida
Sentiu-se atraída depois então apareceu
Mas ficou tão enternecida Indagou
A si mesma a estrela afinal será ela ou sou eu

O mar serenou quando ela pisou na areia
Quem samba na beira do mar é sereia

Cida Moreira,"E do amor gritou-se o escândalo
Do medo criou-se o trágico
No rosto pintou-se o pálido
E não rolou uma lágrima
Nem uma lástima
Pra socorrer

E na gente deu o hábito
De caminhar pelas trevas
De murmurar entre as pregas
De tirar leite das pedras
De ver o tempo correr

Mas, sob o sono dos séculos
Amanheceu o espetáculo
Como uma chuva de pétalas
Como se o céu vendo as penas
Morresse de pena
E chovesse o perdão

E a prudência dos sábios
Nem ousou conter nos lábios
O sorriso e a paixão

Pois transbordando de flores
A calma dos lagos zangou-se
A rosa-dos-ventos danou-se
O leito dos rios fartou-se
E inundou de água doce
A amargura do mar

Numa enchente amazônica
Numa explosão atlântica
E a multidão vendo em pânico
E a multidão vendo atônita
Ainda que tarde
O seu despertar",Rosa-Dos-Ventos,

Vou seguindo sem parar
Nesta louca estrada
O meu destino não tem nada a mais
Que uma carona nesse mundo a mil
Vejo tudo passar num segundo

E recomeça a cada lance legal

Não escolhe onde vai parar

O amor é maior que tudo

Em que eles se encontraram
Na praia do pinhal

Não me leve a mal

Um cara desses
Que estuda demais
Procurando encontrar
A solução pra tudo
Com muita paz
E agora o pinhal
Não tem mais

Que a gente cresceu
Na beira do mar

Há pouco tempo
E quem tocou na formatura
Fui eu

Dona dos meus olhos é você, avião no ar
Um dia pra esses olhos sem te ver, é como chão do mar
Liga o radio a pilha a TV, só pra você escutar
A nova musica que eu fiz agora
Lá fora a rua vazia chora

Os meus olhos vibram ao te ver, são dois fãs, um par
Luz nos olhos vidros pra poder, melhor te enxergar
Luz dos olhos para anoitecer, é só você se afastar
Pinta os lábios para escrever, a tua boca em mim

Que a nossa musica eu fiz agora, lá fora a lua irradia a gloria
E eu te chamo, eu te peço vem
Diga que você me quer, porque eu te quero também

Faço as pazes lembrando 
Passo as tardes tentando lhe telefonar
Cartazes te procurando
Aeronaves seguem posando sem você desembarcar
Pra eu te dar a mão nessa hora
Levar as malas pro fusca lá fora

E eu vou guiando, eu te espero vem
Siga onde vão meus pés, porque eu te sigo também

Eu sofrendo a repressão
Praticada por você

A nossa história parece um filme
Que assistimos na semana passada
Final feliz, isso é normal

Que desse amor não podemos fugir

Eu quero é jogar (zaia!)

Fuck it, I'll serve you straight from the kitchen

What I dreamed it would be
And one day if I fell in love then I would see
But I believed when my love came
My dreams would all come true

But I'm no better now
Now that we're worlds apart
Now as the teardrops start

That it wouldn't last

And foolishly I thought
That I could mean much more to you

You told me I was everything a love should be
I was your destiny
I was your reason to live
And you would give all of life's treasures to me

Now I can hear them laughing as they pass my way
They say, ""I told you so"", there's nothing I can say
For they were right and I was wrong
They said so from the start

I lost the only love I knew when I lost you
Yes, all too late, I realized your words were lies

Cilla Black," took a room in a house of gloom 
Somewhere I could hide my soul 
There I hoped to find a way to ease my mind 
Couldn't face the gloom tomorrow 

I sat until the hours of three or four 
Thinking doesn't help but seems 
I crept to bed and cried myself to sleep once more 
Then I had the wildest dream 

(Street called Hope) in a town named Freedom 
Where each clock is pointed to the hour of love 
Upon a street called Hope at the house of Welcome 
That's where she opened the door of love 

When I awoke the following day 
Every doubt had left my mind 
My dream it taught me what the prophets say 
Those who seek will always find 

I ran down the stair and out in to the street 
Looking for the nearest phone 
We both said sorry and decided to meet 
To find ourselves a happy home 

You know we're looking for a street called Hope 
In a town name Freedom 
Where each clock is pointed to the hour of love

Warmed by a glow of insolvency,
Up to your necks in security.

I cannot go out and steal for you,
I cannot die like Camille for you.

How can love survive?

Are too busy for simple pleasure.
When you are poor it is toujours l'amour,
For l'amour all the poor have leisure!

Lost in our wealthy domains are we,
Trapped by our capital gains are we,
But we'll keep romance alive.

Her dress has got a tear
She waltzes on her way to Mass
And whistles on the stair
And underneath her wimple
She has curlers in her hair

She's always late for chapel
But her penitence is real
She's always late for everything
Except for every meal

How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?

Out of focus and bemused
And I never know exactly where I am
Unpredictable as weather

She's a darling! She's a demon! She's a lamb!

She'd out pester any pest
Drive a hornet from its nest
She could throw a whirling dervish out of whirl
She is gentle! She is wild!
She's a riddle! She's a child!
She's a headache! She's an angel!

And I must face a man who hates me

S'posin' I lose my fair-haired beauty

Vowed it would be my life or his'n

Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

For something different

Let it drift away, don't you wait too long

Over and over in circles
As my heart's racing from this

Wearing me out like a song

With a happy ending

It's only for the news

Picked up the telephone but all i got's a major attitude

People standing up and being
Who they want to be
People made the music
And the music may them free

The summer of love they say
But it still feels like it was yesterday
And if the road gets rough
I pick up my guitar and play

It's always been right by my side
To help me on my way

Now I don't need to worry 'bout tomorrow
Ain't anticipating what's to come
And I don't need to worry 'bout
The things I have not done
Long as I got rock and roll
I'm forever young

Now we can't always understand this world
Farther along we'll understand it all
The '70s looked like we all
Were headed for a fall
But those who listened hard enough
Could hear the summer call

Now I was growing up through all of this
My first beer and love and my first kiss
You never learn the things in school
You learn by living and going through
You taught me to be myself
How can I thank you

Answers to the questions that nobody knew
Used to be a time when I had some time
But when I had the time, I didn't know what to do

Wasted all those years never gettin? any younger
Times kept a changin? but I still got the hunger
Only trouble is the walls are closing in
Sometimes I want to give it all away

I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again

Maybe I?ll head down south to New Orleans
Wouldn't have no taxes ?cause I wouldn't have no means
Lookin' for a Genie that could fill my dreams
But dreams become reality and real ain't what it seems to be

I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again

I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again

Sick for the cure on this roller coaster ride
It can take you real low and it can get you real high
Just passin? time
But time ain't on our side
Ah, guitar

I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again

I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails

You know I'd make it all last

It's just the low road in disguise

Ah yea
Everything's gonna be alright, yea

Got to the top of an uphill climb
Only to look down the other side
Just when you think it's on your side
This world will show you ain't no reason to the rhyme

Get yourself a pretty wife

But nobody's got the answers

Well it'll only give you cancer

said my father, said he,
I've an elegant legacy 
waiting for ye.
Tis a rhyme for your lips 
and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Look to the Rainbow,2006

Please ignore the mess around

Built on rock
I'm just run down
A fixer upper
I just need some sound advise from someone with an open mind
To think creatively of all the possibilities 

See the smile of Mona Lisa
Think the leaning Tower of Pisa
Tilt your head and see the way it stands up tall
Find the beauty in graffiti
The right of Spring by I. Stravinsky
Close your eyes and listen to the beauty of it all
Could you be the one to see
The Masterpiece in me. 

Lights are broken in the hall
A crack runs down my bedroom wall
But character is priceless now or so they say
It suddenly occurs to me while polishing my personality
To leave some roughness there around the edge
Some things don't fit perfectly
That's just called Reality

That have looked so long for this

Everything we need
The reason to lose faith
And the reason to believe

And it's only love

Castles made of sand
That crumbled at our feet
The sound of goodbye
Echoes in our memory

Caught up in the past
Tangled in the chains
And we try to fight the hunger
That only love explains

Give it some gas and
Crash Me
With all you got or pass me

When our ranks begin to form

Do I stay; and do I dare

Will you take your place with me

The time is now, the day is here

One day more

One day more to revolution
We will nip it in the bud
We'll be ready for these schoolboys
They will wet themselves with blood

One day more

Watch 'em run amuck
Catch 'em as they fall
Never know your luck
When there's a free for all
Here's a little 'dip'
There a little 'touch'
Most of them are goners
So they won't miss much

One day to a new beginning

Raise the flag of freedom high

Every man will be a king

Every man will be a king

There's a new world for the winning

There's a new world to be won

Do you hear the people sing

My place is here, I fight with you

One day more

I did not live until today

One more day all on my own

How can I live when we are parted

We will join these people's heroes
We will follow where they go
We will learn their little secrets
We will know the things they know

One day more

Tomorrow you'll be worlds away

What a life I might have known

And yet with you my world has started

One more day to revolution
We will nip it in the bud
We'll be ready for these schoolboys

Watch 'em run amok
Catch 'em as they fall

Cindy Blackman,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1989
Cindy Blackman,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Cindy Blackman,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water,1997
Cindy Blackman,"We had a lot of luck on Venus
We always had a ball on Mars
Meeting all the groovey people

We danced around with Borealice

Come on let's go Space Truckin'

Remember when we did the moonshot
And Pony Trekker led the way
We'd move to the Canaveral moonstop
And everynaut would dance and sway
We got music in our solar system
We're space truckin' round the stars
Come on let's go Space Truckin'

The fireball that we rode was moving
But now we've got a new machine

There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore

And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

By the cruel force of nature from the blue

It's wilting the quilting on my maiden form
And mascara flows right down my nose
Because of the storm

Cindy Cuevas,"Fue en un pueblo con mar
Una noche después de un concierto
Tú reinabas detrás
De la barra del único bar que vimos abierto
""Cántame una canción
Al oído y te pongo un cubata""
""Con una condición
Que me dejes abierto el balcón de tus ojos de gata""
Loco por conocer

Los secretos de su dormitorio
Esa noche canté
Al piano del amanecer todo mi repertorio
Los clientes del bar
Uno a uno se fueron marchando
Tú saliste a cerrar
Yo me dije

""Cuidado, chaval, te estas enamorando""
Luego todo pasó
De repente, su dedo en mi espalda
Dibujo un corazón
Y mi mano le correspondió debajo de tu falda
Caminito al hostal
Nos besamos en cada farola
Era un pueblo con mar

Yo quería dormir contigo y tú no querías dormir sola
Y nos dieron las diez y las once, las doce y la una
Y las dos y las tres
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna
Nos dijimos adiós
Ojalá que volvamos a vernos
El verano acabó
El otoño duró lo que tarda en llegar el invierno

Y a tu pueblo el azar
Otra vez el verano siguiente
Me llevó, y al final
Del concierto me puse a buscar tu cara entre la gente
Y no halle quien de ti
Me dijera ni media palabra
Parecía como si
Me quisiera gastar el destino una broma macabra

No había nadie detrás
De la barra del otro verano
Y en lugar de tu bar
Me encontré una sucursal del banco hispano americano
Tu memoria vengué
A pedradas contra los cristales
""Se que no lo soñé""
Protestaba mientras me esposaban los municipales

En mi declaración
Alegué que llevaba tres copas
Y empecé esta canción
En el cuarto donde aquella vez te quitaba la ropa
Y nos dieron las diez y las once, las doce y la una
Y las dos y las tres
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna",Y Nos Dieron Las Diez,2006

Cindy Horstman,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

Catching fireflies at night, building castles in the sand
Kissing mama's face goodnight and holding daddy's hand
Thank you, Lord, how could I ask for more?

Running barefoot through the grass, a little hide and go seek
Being so in love that you can hardly eat
Dancing in the dark when there's no one else around
Being bundled 'neath the covers, watching snow fall to the ground
Thank you, Lord, how could I ask for more?

So many things I thought would bring me happiness
Some dreams that are realities today
Such an irony the things that mean the most to me
Are the memories that I've made along the way

I took it for granted but I can't take it no more
I guess nobody's perfect
We're always last to admit that we should blame ourselves

So love is lost, don't we know our hearts anymore
Now tell me, if this life's a game of give and take
Why are we taking so much, we've been taking so much
We gotta learn how to give, it's time to let it begin

Let it be love, let it be true
Cause love will be all that we remember
Open up our arms to each other
Oh, let it be love
Don't you know the heart and soul are what matter

Let it be love
Cause love will be all that lasts forever
Open up our hearts to each other
Oh and let it be love

I stand with a stranger, wond'ring what I'm afraid of
I feel like a prisoner, holding the key to the door
Why run from each other
We've lead ourselves to believe that no one really cares

So on we go, I wonder what we're leaving behind
Now tell me what's a broken world supposed to do
When we've been hurting so much, we've been hurting so much
We've got to find love in Him, so won't you let it begin

Oh and praise Him in the noon day 
For gentle birds that sing 
Oh praise Him all ye people 
Praise the King 

And praise Him for a peaceful porch 
And rocking chairs that sway 
Praise Him for the rolling hills 
Where children laugh and play 
Oh and praise Him for the wandering soul 
That never lost their way

Oh and praise Him that His tender love will still forgive today

Cindy Morgan,"Who can say when life is over
The silver cord breaks and our breath returns to God
Will we walk through fields of clover
Or soar up high through valleys deep and wide

Cindy Morgan,"Name your price, I'll take you to paradise
I can't stay here any more
And I've looked high and low
I've been from shore to shore to shore
If there's a short cut I'd have found it
But there's no easy way around it

Light of the world, shine on me, love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free, love is the answer

Who knows why someday we all must die
We're all homeless boys and girls
And we are never heard
It's such a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely world
People turn their heads and walk on by
Well, tell me, is it worth just another try?

Light of the world, shine on me, love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free, love is the answer

Tell me, are we alive, or just a dying planet?
What are the chances?
Ask the man in your heart for the answers

And when you feel afraid, love one another
When you've lost your way, love one another
And when you're all alone, love one another
When you're far from home, love one another

When you're down and out, love one another
When your hope's run out, love one another
When you need a friend, love one another
When you're near the end, love, we got to love
We got to love one another

Light of the world, shine on me, love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free, love is the answer

And a little of us died

You see her daddy drank
And he ran around
He ran away with all her dreams

You can learn how to fly
Let the wind carry you
far deep and wide

Well, it's okay to cry
Cause your tears will bloom
Someday on the other side

I never like my mama's daddy
For more reasons than I can share
My mama held him as he died
And I'm ashamed to say I never cried
Chubby fat and insecure
Two crooked teeth
And clothes from a thrift store
Well I never quite fit in
I guess that's why I'm singing

Seems crystal clear

Blinded by sanity
What's behind the crimson door?

Incapable of seeing signs
There's just one miracle
That's left of this love

After the rain
I still see heaven crying
After the rain
I still feel no relief
Cause everything we used to be
And used to feel
It all becomes so frightening real
After the rain

Rainbow skies turned to grey
Ever since we lost our smile
Innocence gone astray
Since the day we said goodbye

Aborted in this dried out stream
There's just one miracle

It seems once again
I forgot what keeps me safe and dry

Into the weepy windowpanes that are dripping with dew
I can hear the rain outside
Falling from the sky and you can hear it

Pitter patter on the rooftop
You can listen to the rhythm of the raindrops
I wish that the sun would come and stay
This is a song for rainy days

Let's go dance around in the rain
Don't pay any attention to the people staring from inside
We'll leave all our cares behind and you can hear it the

Pitter patter on the rooftop
You can listen to the rhythm of the raindrops
I wish that the sun would come and stay
This is a song for rainy days

And I know once the clouds shed their tears
I know that I'll be okay
I know that I'll be okay

Even if the rain always wins
And forces my eyes shut to dream of
I'll still dream of brighter days

Pitter patter on the rooftop
You can listen to the rhythm of the raindrops
I wish that the sun would come and stay
But this is a song for rainy days

Using microphones set it off like the fuse in the Cipher zone
As I'm tellin' crews be gellin'
Rhymes blow your outter skeleton if your styles relevant
You know the flavor I gets deep like the grave
Headcracks I gave when tomahawk like a Brave
Now I'm paid in the trade like Special Ed Got It Made
Some conquer slave along the way sprayed like Raid
In 92 I spent my days in the YMCA
Freestyling while I cut the cross fade like a blade 
Stayed off the stage writting page after page
Now I blast like a gauge twisting raps like braids
Laid stunts like I forgot, blunts got me all high
Hittin' stick after stick as I kick back
Acting like you run shit, rappin' all that dumb shit
You ain't the first one to brag about your fuckin' guns kid
Uzis and toolies they just don't impress
Whoole under the best bless let's my brain arrest stress

They stack doe and try to stake me off the cash flow

You could never catch me empty handed at the mic stance
Understand I'm fed flippin' like tails and head
Born dead of the coffin known for droppin' non stoppin' schemes
Hit your spleen box and leave you fiendin' for oxygen
Rockin' 'em in Boston cause yo we ain't soft when I blow spots off
Then step collect my props and be out with the skins or punany

Stop (stop!) I really love you

Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand

Tear the heart right out of me

Becomes final today

Will be going away
But I love you both, and this will be pure H-E-double-L on me

La noche que no acaba
Sólo eso queda

Sólo quedan las ganas de llorar
Al ver que nuestro amor se aleja
Frente a frente bajamos la mirada
Pues ya no queda nada de que hablar

Nada queda
Toca ternura la una vez, alciendo la locura
Un beso y a la fuerza queda
Queda un gesto amable para no hacer
La vida insoportable y así, las penas
Sólo eso queda

Sólo quedan las ganas de llorar
Al ver que nuestro amor se aleja
Frente a frente
(Frente a frente)
Bajamos la mirada
Pues ya no queda nada de que hablar
Nada

Sólo quedan las ganas de llorar
Al ver que nuestro amor se aleja

Trapped on a dying world, a world of hate and pain
The judgment has arrived and the verdict is insane
The masses cringe in fear for their sentence has arrived
May the punishment be slow and the guilty flayed alive",Doomed Planet,1986
Cirith Ungol,"Forging the fire last chance to fight
Demons of evil at one with the night
Kingdoms of greed from the blood of man
Vampires all, bring them down if we can

[Chorus]
Forging the fire not alone in the fight we're at one with the night

Stealing from beggars their stock in trade
Nowhere to run the judgement's been made
Fleeing from vengeance like dogs on the run
Search and destroy bring them down one by one

[Chorus]

Driving the demons the iron hand
Standing together the throne of man
Forging the fire not alone in the fight
Hard stand the victors at one with the night",The Fire,1986
Cirith Ungol,"Mighty warrior raise your sword against the seething chaos horde
Sworn to serve but taught to hate the unseen masters of your fate

Nadsokor

Mighty balance in the sky determines who's the next one to die
The black sword drinks on the souls that fell
And sucks it with it down to hell

Nadsokor",Nadsokor,1986
Cirith Ungol,"The cry has arisen across the land
We're choked by the grip of the iron hand
The sting of the whip the toll of the bell
We ravage the world with one foot in hell

Up from the darkness the cauldrons of hate
The vengeance of old the sealing of fate
The screams of the damned the souls that fell
With one foot in heaven the other in hell

The savior we worship won't lead us astray
The unholy masses have seen the last day
The howl of the jackal the beast's evil stare
With one foot in hell do you think that we care?",One Foot in Hell,1986
Cirith Ungol,"As you stand before the gates of hell the future so unclear
As you stand before the gates of hell the devil draws you near

War Eternal

The doomed one slowly beckons and draws you to his side
He speaks the curse to take your soul along the midnight ride

War Eternal

When he looks into your eyes the skin melts off your back
And when he gets you all alone you know he'll soon attack

War Eternal

He starts to rob you of your soul you're trying to fight back
Curse the beast and raise your sword to launch the first attack

War Eternal

The war that stands eternal the battle you can't win
He'll rule the world and if he can't he'll burn it down with him",War Eternal,1986
Cirith Ungol,"In Hell s corrupt and sunken halls the rising shall begin,
The bane of man immortal - the parade of broken dead.
With greed our worldly master, so now pain will be our guide, 
As the fallen ones await us all to welter by their side. 

Iron dreams of human jackals and our final fate is cast 
To slave in endless fire as you cringe before the lash. 
Blinded by the darkness, as you pray for his return. 
But in your soul you fear he s just another one who'll burn.

With greed our worldly master, now pain will be our guide, 
As the fallen ones await us all to welter by their side. 
Iron dreams of human jackals - our final fate is cast, 
To slave in endless fire, as you cringe before the lash. 

Does evil lie in waiting to extract his heavy toll. 
Will bowing to the pulpit bring the cloven to their goal, 
But if he s the work of mankind, and the beast our morbid dream, 
This dying planet is our heaven, and our hell remains the same.",Before the Lash,1991
Cirith Ungol,"The doomed one s fallen armies sound the tolling of the bell, 
While sin and death stand silent guard outside the Gates of Hell.
He slowly spreads his leather wings and soars above the land, 
He strokes his pointed beard and casts an evil eye toward man.

Unchains the dogs of chaos to complete his evil chore 
To make the cringing herd of man his thralls by right of war.
They gorge on fatal fruit, taste of dust and bitter ash, 
While fire burns in Heaven and immortal forces clash.

The smell of burning brimstone, lightning flung from golden hands.
To rule without a master is the only dream of man. 
As they swap our souls among them and prepare the final feast,
Begin the war eternal, cast aside both God and Beast. 

Moving toward the evil song that fate will sadly sing, 
How the pride of man has fallen, crowning lust their only king. 
Heaven screams in anguish and the world cries out in pain, 
Unleash the final terror, man begins his now doomed reign.",Chaos Rising,1991
Cirith Ungol,"Moving toward the evil song that fate will sadly sing. 
How the pride of man has fallen, crowning lust their only king 
Heaven screams in anguish and the world cries out in pain.
Unleash the final terror- man begins his now doomed reign. 

False prophets spread their cursed rule across the poisoned land,
Why must we always choose to put our fate in reckless hands? 
Fingers poised on Armageddon, dare they make the fatal move, 
And send this dying planet hurling headlong to the tomb.

Broken leaders mark the twisted path that mankind chose. 
Final judgement is upon us, vengeance rains its fearful blows. 
So we hurl our prayers toward heaven, surely they will heed the call - 
But soulless skies just echo with the screams of mankind s fall.",Fallen Idols,1991
Cirith Ungol,"Don t need a crystal ball to show me where I m going,
Cause I m making it right, making it right, right this time.
Ever since you left me all I want is you, 
But I m making it fine, making it fine, draw the line. 

I was born with a six string in my hand, 
1'll follow the dream to the end. 
And I'll go it alone.

Seems without me you re just searching you keep hoping.
You are standing in line, standing in line, burning time. 
Never believed that Id be back on the streets,
So I'll follow the dream, follow the dream, yeah tonight.

I was born with a six string in my hand, 
I'll follow the dream to the end.
And I'll go it alone. 

Don t need a crystal ball to show me where I'm going, 
Cause I'm making it right, making it right, right this time. 
With or without you, I've got to live this dream, 
Cause its once in a life, once in a life, my lifetime. 

I was born with a six string in my hand, 
I'll follow the dream to the end. 
And I'll go it alone.",Go It Alone,1991
Cirith Ungol,"As I gaze into my crystal ball, I II tell you what I see,
Slowly but surely it s genocide, the fate that we shall meet. 
We say we are the civilized, none as advanced as we, 
Seeking the knowledge of space and time, 
As we poison the earth, the sea, and sky...

All we see is the ground beneath our feet, never looking twice,
Take a look around the world at all the ignorant sacrifice. 
Profit was the main thing on our agenda through all of the years,
Never thought twice about a living thing or 
All of the future tears we II cry. 

The fact is without a doubt, 
Our time is running out,
Heaven help us. 

Tons of acid and toxic waste, are dumped in the air we breathe, 
Millions of barrel of nuclear waste, beneath the earth and sea,
The price of pollution cannot be set, it s an unworldly cost. 
The damage is done and we cannot forget, the senseless 
And needless lost of life...

Slowly building up, like a time bomb ticking away,
No one seems to care, that our world is wasting away.
Someday we II be sorry and we'll have ourselves to blame, 
No one wants to admit the fact that we live our lives in vain
To die.",Heaven Help Us,1991
Cirith Ungol,"Underneath the new born sun, 
Man and beast rejoice as one, 
They cast aside their age-old kings, 
Smash their chains and spread their wings. 

Their seed corrupt, their lies undone. 
The final fall - man s will be done. 
They torch the sky and rape the land, 
And plead for truth with blood-stained hands. 

Mark their reign with greed and fear, 
As justice calls to deafened ears, 
Their twisted dreams bring forth the day. 
A world of ash, and slow decay. 

Underneath the blackened sun, 
The final battle fought and won. 
Mankind claims their just reward, 
And chaos sounds the final chord.",Paradise Lost,1991
Cirith Ungol,"Hides under a bridge, 
Where he can t be seen.
Huddled under a bankside,
Staring into a stream.

Want to cross this bridge,
Well better be aware. 
There is a brown hairy troll,
Goin' give you a scare. 

Yea, I'm the troll,
This is my bridge, 
Go turn around, 
Back through the ridge.

Yeah, I 'm the troll, 
Don t you even dare, 
Yea, I'm the troll, 
Goin' get you there, 

Monster from beneath. 
Bastard of grief,
Such a sad sigh,
Does he want to die?

In a mind of fear,
The troll lives in my mind.
I must forget this fear of regret.

The Troll will charge a toll,
That is, your life,
So this is it,
You better think Twice,

Cause here he is,",The Troll,1991
Cirith Ungol,"Our comrades in arms lying dead in the streets
From choking on metal that s spineless and weak.
The Jackals are gloating, with victory in hand.
But the last true believers rise up from the land, 

Howling our metal we light up the world, 
And the banner of Ungol is proudly unfurled.
Raising our legion, and now you belong, 
And the point of the blade will be screaming our song, 

Crushing the upstarts with steel in hand, 
Our forces together, and nothing can stand.
The Legion of Chaos shall vanquish the wrong, 
And sweep them aside to make way for the strong,",Join the Legion,2003
Ciro,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,
Ciro,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,
Ciro,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,

Brillaba en la acción
No ven que estoy embretao

Ya no me falta pa completar
Más que ir a misa e hincarme a rezar

We gotta love ya, that's real, uh

To all my ladies in lingerie, never under age
Who stay gettin' paid, who like to take trips where the sun is shade
To my women who love to ball out
And spend all that money 'til ya all out

I feel like a pimp with a different pimp game, with a different pimp name
With a little pimp fame
I'm loaded with cash, loaded with class, loaded with a lot of things
Even got a gat loaded for that ass

I love my mind, love my soul, love my body
I don't drink or smoke that's why I love my body
You might catch me chillin' with a little short hottie
With a little piercing on her body

Yes, I get it poppin, 'specially overseas
Japenese girls even love my beat
They say, ""Timbaland's we love you
We love the dope things that you do""

Even in London they say, ""Tim, we love ya""
They even call me things like wicked and the f'n governor
That's why I can't forget why'all
That's why I had to make this roll call, uh

This here's for one and all
It's so good to feel all a y'all, oooh
Make that move and just ball out, oooh

It's so good to feel all a y'all, oooh
Make that move and just ball out, oooh
