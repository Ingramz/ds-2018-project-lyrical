Sammy Hagar,"I've read it all, it's black and white 
The spectrum made a shade I like
The crimson rays are ruby bright 
Technicolor light
Red! I want red, there's no substitute for red 
Red! Paint it red, green ain't mean compared to red
You don't know what it does to me
My crimson intensity 
I'm haunted by the mystery
The mystery of red
Red knocks 'em dead 
Some like it hot, I like it red
Red is my lover, got it covered 
Red is my number, sure as a coma 
Red is my drummer, and I hear red thunder 
Move over brother 
Red's a motherfucker) 
(Red! Red!) 
that's' what I said... 
(Red! Red!) 
Come on to bed 
(Red! Red!) 
Gimme' that expensive spread...",Red [Live],1999
Sammy Hagar,"Don't want to wait 'til tomorrow
Why put it off another day?
One by one, little problems
Build up, and stand in our way. Oh

One step ahead, one step behind it
Now ya gotta run to get even
Make future plans I'll dream about yesterday, hey!
Come on turn, turn this thing around

(Right now) Hey! It's your tomorrow
(Right now) Come on, it's everything
(Right now) Catch your magic moment
Do it right here and now

It means everything
Miss a beat, you lose a rhythm
An nothin' falls into place. No!
Only missed by a fraction

Slipped a little off your pace. Oh!
The more things you get, the more you want
Just trade in one for another
Workin' so hard to make it easy

Whoa, got to turn. Come on, turn this thing around
(Right now) Hey, it's your tomorrow
(Right now) Come on, it's everything
(Right now) catch that magic moment

Do it right here and now
It means everything
Said a lie to me 
Right now

What are ya waitin' for? Oh! Yeah!
Right now

(Right now) Hey! It's your tomorrow
(Right now) Come on, it's everything
(Right now) Catch that magic moment
And do it right, right now (Right now)

Oh, right now!
It's what's happening
Right here and now
Right now, it's right now

Oh!
Tell me, what are ya waitin' for?
Turn this thing around",Right Now,1999
Sammy Hagar,"Sitting in the morning sun
I'll be sitting when the evening comes
Watching the ships roll in
And I watch 'em roll away again

[Refrain]
Sitting on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm just sitting on the dock of the bay
Wasting time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the 'Frisco bay
'Cause I had nothin to live for
And look like nothing's gonna come my way

So I'm just...
[Refrain]

Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same

Sittin here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home

Now, I'm just...",(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,1999
Sammy Hagar,"So much for friendly conversation 
Simple advice between friends 
When you step between two lovers 
They're steppin' out, you're steppin' in 
Oh Lord...here we go again 
Hey! I'm in the middle, stuck here in the middle 
Yea! I'm in the middle, I can't stand the middle 
Hey! diddle diddle it sucks here in the middle 
Yea! I'm in the middle, can't stand the middle 
Three in the middle still leaves two on the outside 
I'd rather be right white conservative or 
Far left cult radical extreme 
I never learned to keep my mouth shut 
Just speak my mind every time 
Can I lay it on the line? 
Hey, I'm in the middle, I can't stand the middle 
Yea! I'm in the middle, it sucks here in the middle 
Hey! diddle diddle, I'm stuck in the middle 
Yea! I'm in the middle, I can't stand the middle 
Three in the middle still leaves two on the outside 
Yea...I can't stand the middle! 
Yea! Yea! 
Well this thing is killing me 
I'm in the middle, it sucks here in the middle 
I'm in the middle, I can't stand the middle 
Hey! I'm in the middle, I can't stand the middle 
Hey! I'm in the middle, stuck here in the middle 
Three in the middle still leaves two on the outside 
I'm in the middle, can't stand the middle 
In the middle, I can't stand the middle

Sammy Hagar,"Sally's in love 
With her automobile 
Says she feels so sexy 
From behind the wheel 
She got dual carburetors 
Ported and relieved 
She pull the soft top down 
She makes the devil believe 
Packs a four-twenty seven 
Down on 101 
Crack a buck ten-eleven 
On the radar gun 
She roll it over to the shoulder 
Moving past her man 
Swing it back to the fast lane 
Singing catch me if you can 
She got five speed, four elevens 
Ten thirteen in a quarter mile 
Trick gas, full blown nitrous 
Speed queen with a smile 
Ride, ride, ride 
Let Sally ride 
Drive, drive, drive 
Let Sally drive 
Ride, ride, ride 
Let Sally ride 
Drive, drive, drive 
Let Sally drive 
Drive, drive, drive 
Got long tall Sally 
Blastin' on the box 
Just like Mustang Sally 
Kicked up a notch 
Puts the pedal to the metal 
Tacking seven grand 
Smoking fifty yards of rubber 
In the rear view mirror 
Singing catch me if you can",Let Sally Drive,2000

I’ve asked you once, I asked you nice
Mother Earth will punish you
With some serious juju

Astronomical divide
We stand and watch two worlds collide
Paranoia, paralyzed
We need some serious juju

Untied from the whippin' post
Set free from Mary’s spell
Cut loose from the ball and chain
9 steps from the wishing well

Tuggin’ on the Devil’s sleeve
He’ll cut a deal for me
Locate me anywhere, I’ll be there
It’s serious, it’s serious

The politicians speech is jive
He lies to keep the lie alive
While mass confusion makes ‘em strong
It’s serious, serious juju

Got no agenda here
I got to scream it out
Moments of clarity
I’d rather be without

It’s never loud enough
Shouts out a distant child
Ignore my bloody throat
I’ll go the extra mile

Yeah, it’s serious juju

Sammy Hagar,"A deeper kinda love 
Has no borderlines, no ties 
A deeper kinda love 
Can bring you down and lift you up so high 

A phoenix starts to rise from the ashes inside my soul 
Leaving old wounds behind, a new me is born 
And you show me your world 
So dangerous, but I let go 

And when I fall, I fall deep 
Into a deeper kinda love

Can also bring hurt and pain 

And in the shadow that it casts 
Lies jealousy, fear, and hate 
The more I have to win means the more I have to lose

This cute story of Army life romance by Don Cornell

I left my heart at the stage door canteen

I kept her serving doughnuts

I sat there dunking doughnuts

He threw a magic spell of moonbeams all around us
And when he saw the scene was set,
He whispered let there be love.

The sleepy birds up in the branches
They stayed awake, they weren't taking any chances
Because they knew that they 
Would soon be singing let there be love

The night winds that kissed your cheeks
Had been preparing weeks and weeks
They told the raindrops from above
Be sure and stay away on this night of love

They are so overjoyed the stars were even dancing
And then our hearts told us to kiss, and whispered

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.

Sammy Kaye & His Orchestra,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away

They only told me we were parting
The same old harbor lights that once brought you to me

It was paradise from nine to one

We had wild streaks and reckless hearts
We came alive when the town got dark
We did a lot of living and loving under the gun
Oh it was paradise from nine to one

We had the whole town bettin' on what we'd do
They'd already seen how I looked at you

Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend

You've just got to see me through another day

Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now

On the cigarettes there in the ashtray

But at least your lips caressed them while you packed
And a lip print on a half-filled cup of coffee
That I poured and didn't drink
But at least you thought you wanted it
And that's so much more then I can say for me

It's been a good year for the roses
And many blooms still linger there

As the door behind you closes

It's the first time that I haven't made the bed
I guess the reason we're not talkin'
There's so little left to say,we haven't said

I find I haven't spoke a word
And from the bedroom,the familiar sounds
Of our one baby's cryin' goes unheard

I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you, oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

It's buried with her memory
And it's a living hell here after dark

Late at night a slamming door
Shadows move across the floor
Footsteps fall on silent stairs
I hear her call but no one's there

Her photograph hangs by the bed

I've always heard you say, I could tell you anything
Oh the times I made you laugh, the times I dried your tears
Through the good and bad I've always been right there

An arms length away
Right in front of your face
This close to your lips, right at your finger tips
That one true love, you're dreaming of
Darlin' what would you say
If I told you it's an arms length away

For so long I've longed to hold you, oh the nights I almost told you
I stopped myself afraid, of just what you might say
And the love that you have searched for, that seems so out of reach
Have you ever stopped to think it might be me

And you are the reason I'm alive
And baby baby baby
When I think of how you saved me
I go crazy

I've never known love like this
And it fills me with a new tenderness
And I know I know I know
You're in my heart you're in my soul
You're all I can't resist

And I need to tell you
The first time I held you
I knew you are the love of my life

I spent a lifetime waiting
Always hesitating until you
I was lost so deep inside my shell
'Til you came and saved me from myself
Now all I really know
Is I need you

And you are the love of my life
All the joy and tears that I cry
And baby baby baby
You don't have to say a word
I see it in your eyes

As we stand together
I promise forever

Sammy Kershaw,"We met at the broken spoke restaurant and lounge
I lit your cigarette and then you wrote your number down
On the inside of a matchbook that was laying on the bar
And a fire started burning somewhere in my heart

I didn't see it coming, guess I didn't read the signs
I just never thought you'd leave me after all this time
But today when I came home my key was hollow in the door
And there was nothing but a worn out book of matches on the floor

You took the bed
You took the dishes and the car
You broke my trust
You took advantage of my heart
You left me here
With empty rooms and walls with holes and scars and scratches
If I find the strength to burn you memories down
At least you left the matches

The color's old and faded the cover's worn and stained
But i can still make out the numbers and the heart beside your name
Until tonight they'd only lit a single cigarette
Now one by one I'm striking them to help me to forget

And everybody at the broken spoke
All thought my crazy story was a joke
Now they're out there in the parking lot
Staring at the smoke

You took the bed
You took the dishes and the car
You broke my trust
You took advantage of my heart
You left me here
With empty rooms and walls with holes and scars and scratches
And the hurt I need to burn those memories down
At least you left the matches

Baby all that's left of our love now is ashes
Thank God you left the matches",Matches,1997

Like I got one day left to live

Telling lies bout the girls we knew perpetuating backseat legends
Fours years worth of near misses too numerous for me to mention

Watching grass grow as the sun goes down
Cruising Friday nights at the Dairy Queen 
Driving 'round and 'round
Shootin' the bull in an old cowtown

And I decided the girl next door wasn't enough to hold me 
I left town on the 4th of July and caught a glimpse in my rearview mirror
Of Junior, Steve, and Sonny at the gas station
Looking like a permanent fixture

Better be careful where you take a step, keep one eye on the ground

And life on the big city streets
It's folks talking on the corner, and gabbing on the steps

Even hauled my truck away

I'll never love again it's true
The way that I love you

Sometimes I'm moved to tears
'Cause girl I just can't believe
I found the person I've searched for
Seems like eternity
When I look into your blue-green eyes
I see my future and I realize
That's it's paradise

'Cause when you love someone
Really love someone
You'd walk through fire to see her smile
To be the father of her child
What you wouldn't do
'Cause when you love someone
Your heart and soul are one
I'll never love again it's true
The way that I love you
I'll never love again it's true

But maybe not tonight

You're still the only one

But she acted like I wasn't even there

In California, sun sinking out of sight
Like I didn't hear her say ""I love you""
Laying on the beach that night

Like I wasn't standing in that cafe
Losing her all over again
All I could do was stare
While she acted like I wasn't even there

I thought I might walk over
Then she'd have to say ""hello""
But then again, just what good would that do?

So I motioned to the waitress
""I'll take a call for you to go
And keep that change, I'll try to play it cool""

Then I heard that voice above the crowd
I felt like I was trying to breath thin air
And she acted like I wasn't even there

In the rock with that diamond in my hand
Like we didn't talk about forever
A picket fence on a little land

Like I wasn't standing in that cafe
Losing her all over again
All I could do was stare
While she acted like I wasn't even there

Surely I'm still in her heart somewhere
But she acted like I wasn't even there",Like I Wasn't Even There,2010
Sammy Kershaw,"I'm looking like a lobster wearing flip-flops and a Stetson
Guess that's why they call it fishing instead of catching
'Cause I ain't had a single bite all day
But I caught a buzz and there ain't no limit on tang ray

Ain't quite sure how I wound up way down here
It's a long haul to ropes and sails from roping steers
Ain't gonna worry about that, just gonna have some fun
Gotta be one fish down there dumber than I am drunk

I'm what you get when you mix a Prairie dog and an old beach bum

There's a tiki party down the beach about a mile or so
Where they're singing with Jimmy and toasting to Chris LeDoux
And if it weren't for Captain Morgan steering this ship
I might untie that rope and back her on up outta this

Sammy Kershaw,"There are a lot of perfect reasons
To never fight another war
There are a lot of perfect questions
As to what's worth fighting for
There are a lot of perfect fools
Who refuse to read the writing on the wall

But the truth is there are people
Who've made it crystal clear
That it is their holy mission
To destroy all we hold dear
They are visibly out searching for the fire
To make this towing nation fall

Now we can just sit back and wait
Until they spill more precious blood
Or we can seek these cowards out
And nip their slaughter in the bud

Audios sweet home and family
I'm off to fight a war that must be won
You'll know why I'm going when you see
The snow white rows of Arlington

Every blade of grass is sacred
Every headstone is a shrine
To somebody who was willing
To put existence on the line

The liberty we take for granted
Was purchased with their patriotic lives

Are their sleeping spirits restless?
Do they listen for the sound?
Of the mustering of armies
To defend their hallowed ground?
Will we rise to the occasion
To ensure their legacy survives?

Through the willows blow soft breezes
They are whispering my name
Asking did they die for nothing?
Aren't I the keeper of the flame?

Audios sweet home and family
Wave goodbye to your Louisiana son
You will know why I'm leaving when you see
The snow white rows of Arlington

Chewing him like a bulldog on a bone
She was putting him in his place
I mean right up in his face
Dragging him down a list of done did wrongs
It was just about now
That the crowd gathered around
They come to watch him pay for his every sin
She called him everything under the sun
And when we thought she was done
She rared back and she let him have it again, MAN

Clouds are feathers from a lady's fan
Do you remember how we watched them drifting by
Long ago when love began
 
Clouds floating thru the night 
While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye
The night was young
The breeze was warm and tender
A fool was I but how was I to know
I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go 
Like snowhite clouds floating through the night 
Speaking of a love that was heavenly 
A love that could never be mine
 
Once we were together and now we're apart
Did you find it easy to forget?
I keep on dreaming while the years go drifting by
Calling you my ""Sweet Regret""

We argued and you caught the first plane home
We made up and went to Memphis but there wasn't any difference
We were there together but alone

Once we even tried Niagra Falls
But your world and mine collided and one day you decided
We weren't made for each other after all

But I'll always have Denver and that summer to remember
Moonlight in the Rockies and starlight in your eyes
On a mountaintop together we pledged our love forever
There's nothing that could ever take from me what I remember
I'll always have Denver

How could a love so warm and tender grow so cold and bitter
How could all I gave not be enough
Staring at the ceiling it's a painful empty feeling
I don't have you and I don't have your love

Te ayudara vale la pena una vez más

Saber que se puede querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos sacarlos afuera

Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar
Aunque ya ves que no es tan fácil empezar

Sé que lo imposible se puede lograr
Que la tristeza algún día se irá
Y así­ será la vida cambia y cambiará

Sentirás que el alma vuela
Por cantar una vez más

Quitarse los miedos sacarlos afuera

How precious did that grace appear, 
The hour I first believed. 

Through many dangers, toils and snares 
We have already come 
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far 
And grace will lead us home. 

When we've been there ten thousand years 
Bright shining as the sun; 
We've no less days to sing God's praise 
Than when we first begun",Amazing Grace,
Samuel Barnett,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I",Bewitched,2006

Knowing they're happy and they're safe

Want some bacon?
JULES
Naw, man, I don't eat pork.
VINCENT
Are you Jewish?
JULES
I ain't Jewish, I just don't dig on swine, that's all.
VINCENT
Why not?
JULES
Pigs are filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals.
VINCENT
Yeah, but bacon tastes good. Pork chops taste good.
JULES
Hey, a sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie. But I'll never know 'cause I
Wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers. Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's
A filthy animal. I ain't need nothin' that ain't got sense enough to
Disregard its own feces.
VINCENT
How about a dog? Dog eats its own feces.
JULES
I don't eat dog either.
VINCENT
Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?
JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty.
But a dog's got personality. Personality goes a long way.
VINCENT
So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to
Be a filthy animal? Is that true?

Well, we'd have to be talkin' 'bout one charmin' motherfuckin' pig. I mean
He'd have to be ten times more charming that that [...] you know what

-- okay so, tell me again about the hash bars?
VINCENT
Okay what d'you want to know?
JULES
Hash is legal there, right?
VINCENT
Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean you can't
Walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away. I mean they
Want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places.
JULES
Those are hash bars?
VINCENT
Yeah, it breaks down like this, okay: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own
It and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's
Legal to carry it, but that doesn't matter 'cause -- get a load of this,
Alright, -- if you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam, it's illegal for them
To search you. I mean that's a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have.

Oh, man -- I'm goin', that's all there is to it. I'm fuckin' goin'.
VINCENT
You'll dig it the most. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?
JULES
What?
VINCENT
It's the little differences. I mean they got the same shit over there, we got
Here, but it's just there's a little difference.
JULES
Examples?
VINCENT
Alright, well you can walk into a movie theatre in Amsterdam and buy a beer.
And I don't mean in a paper cup. I'm talkin' 'bout a glass of beer. And in
Paris, you can buy a beer at MacDonald's. You know what they call a Quarter
Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
JULES
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?
VINCENT
No, man, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck
A Quarter Pounder is.
JULES
What'd they call it?
VINCENT
They call it Royale with Cheese.
JULES (repeating)
Royale with Cheese. What'd they call a Big Mac?
VINCENT
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.
JULES (repeating)
Le Big Mac. What do they call a Whopper?
VINCENT
I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King. You know what they put on french
Fries in Holland instead of ketchup?

What?
VINCENT
Mayonnaise.

É como não provar o néctar de um lindo amor
Depois que o coração detecta a mais fina flor

Te ver e não te querer
É improvável, é impossível
Te ter e ter que esquecer
É insuportável, é dor incrível

Não posso mais ficar
Pensando bem
Não vale a pena
Ficar tentando em vão
O nosso amor não tem mais solução
Não, não, não, não, não, não, não

Por isso resolvi agora
Te deixar de fora do meu coração
Com você não dá mais certo e ficar sozinho
Minha solução, é solução sim (nao, nao)
Não tem mais solução, não, não, não (nao, nao)

Samuel T. Herring,"On a dark night in the city
Of broken eagles, they fly
Play it cool

Strumming the notes on the guitar
While I'm rocking my leather Mercedez coat like the R in the cut
Licking my wounds and soaking my scars
Crib full of empty bottles of liquor, broken cigars
On a table, going Ninja ? on the cable
When that dance make my stance unstable
Hem the bottom of my pants with staples
I split 'em with symmetry like a bagel
Play tic-tac-toe on your cheek with the razor cut up your facial
Sprinkle the magic dust on the reefer
Gutter creature, rap pornographic snuff double feature
I'm bubbling something up in the beaker
The night creeper, motivational mic speaker
Wallet ring like a Motorolla device beeper
Light sleeper, leave em shook with a light seizure

On a dark night in the city
Of broken eagles, they fly
No don't stress me
Check my leather so
? don't test me
Play it cool
Play it cool
Play it cool

I got that shit for him, I'm finna flush it to you
It's nothing to you sending threats, I'm rushing to you
Have the little homie run it to you, then run into you
Like an intersection, and now you been intercepted
I end a session when the weed's all gone
Like a gardener, just working the hose on the lawn
But I'm a king to a pawn on the chess board
That stresses scores stuck in a square, just press 4
I'm sitting with the best, throwin' the game, picture the picture
In the the same frame of mind, Tarantino official
Couple cameras in the building, the body of work
Mentally a work out, your brain, your body will hurt
Niggas neck broken and bitches' bodies twerk
I swear I get jobs every corner looking for work
Black leather coat, let 'em know the boy is boss
?
And any cars, don't never cross
Don't never get involved
Be the next mystery that's unsolved
Good lord

On a dark night in the city
Of broken eagles, they fly
No don't stress me
Check my leather so
? don't test me
Play it cool
Play it cool
Play it cool
Play it cool
Play it cool
Play it cool

I've been feeling old
I got demons on my soul when I'm writing
The beat play the role of a seat on a bike how I ride it
My vices proposed to me nights when I'm trapped in this pain
Ain't my wife when the light drizzle tap on the pain
I'm inside with them
When the sky clear up, still inside tripping
You can see I ain't been sleeping in my eyes, nigga
In the mirror throwing hands, I don't toss fights
I'm heavyweight, get a load of these light niggas
Looking washed online like light linen drying
I'm through trying with niggas
I'm gifted cause my eyes work in different
And I be seeing straight through the skies as my nigga
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these bitches
And these guys what's the difference, I despise of 'em
I dispose of 'em too, I'm a trashman
You don't want trouble dude
Dirt from the shovel on a low bubble Goose
You a coyote fucking with a roadrunner fool

Samuele Bersani,"Ecco spuntare da un mondo lontano l'ultimo mostro peloso e gigante 
L'unico esempio rimasto di mostro a sei zampe
Quanto mi piace vederlo passare, cosa farei per poterlo toccare 
Io cosa farei

Dicono che sia capace di uccidere un uomo 
Non per difendersi, solo perché non è buono 
Dicono loro che sono scienziati affermati 
Classe di uomini scelti e di gente sicura 
Ma l'unica cosa evidente è che il mostro ha paura 
Il mostro ha paura 

È alla ricerca di un posto lontano dal male 
Certo una grotta in un bosco sarebbe ideale 
Ma l'unico posto tranquillo è quel vecchio cortile 
L'unico spazio che c'è per un grande animale 
Dicono ""siamo in diretta"" lo scoop è servito 
""Questa è la tana del mostro, l'abbiamo seguito"" 
Dicono loro che sono cronisti d'assalto 
Classe di uomini scelti di gente sicura 
Ma l'unica cosa evidente 
L'unica cosa evidente è che il mostro ha paura 
Il mostro ha paura

Basta passare la voce che il mostro è cattivo 
Poi aspettare un minuto e un esercito arriva 
Bombe e fucili ci siamo, l'attacco è totale 
Gruppi speciali circondano il vecchio cortile 
Dicono che sono pronti a sparare sul mostro 
""Lo prenderemo sia vivo che morto sul posto""
Dicono loro che sono soldati d'azione 
Classe di uomini scelti e di gente sicura 
Ma l'unica cosa evidente è che il mostro ha paura 
Il mostro ha paura

Vorrebbe farsi un letargo e prova a chiudere gli occhi 
Ma lui sa che il letargo viene solo d'inverno 
Riapre gli occhi sul mondo, questo mondo di mostri 
Che hanno solo due zampe ma sono molto più mostri 
Gli resta solo una cosa 
Chiamare il suo mondo lontano 
Lo fa con tutto il suo fiato, ma sempre più piano
Vorrei poterlo salvare, portarlo via con un treno 
Lasciarlo dopo la pioggia, là sotto l'arcobaleno",Il Mostro,1992
Samuele Bersani,"Chicco ha una cicatrice sulla faccia
Sta con suo fratello che si fa chiamare Spillo
E sanno già sparare come dei cowboy

Chicco prova al sole di scaldarsi il cucchiaino
Spillo sta rubando un altro motorino
Il maresciallo guarda l'Italia dentro un bar

Vecchi materassi, copertoni, lavandini, cessi rotti
Cazzi disegnati sul palazzo del cornuto
Gli africani alla stazione, l'avvocato del barbiere
Ancora un altro film di Alberto Sordi alla televisione

Chicco è a casa con la faccia sulla radio
Che trasmette la rubrica dei consigli
E lui vorrebbe chiedere come si fa
A fare una rapina in una banca
E a scappare senza che si slaccino le scarpe
E andare dove non c'è mai nessuno che ti sputa contro
E ti vuol mettere nei guai

Tubi di cemento, scatoloni, pannolini
Sacchi d'immondizia messi come pali dai bambini
L'ambulanza della Croce Rossa, c'è qualcuno che sta male
Il prete prepara la chiesa per il funerale
Per il funerale, per il funerale, per il funerale

Spillo ha chiuso la felicità in un fazzoletto
Ma si è seccata in un secondo benedetto
""Pronto chi parla?""
""Sono Chicco, vieni qua, che questa volta è proprio quella buona
Basta un cacciavite per entrare in paradiso""
""Un cacciavite? Aspettami, che arrivo
Prendo il motorino e in un minuto sono lì""
""Ma ti rendi conto quanti sono questi soldi
E come è stato facile rubarli?
Finalmente ci possiamo comperare quello che ci pare
Spiegami perché non parli""

""Lascia stare, sta un po' zitto, non ho voglia di parlare
Manca poco, abbiam finito e andiamo via
Scappa, presto non fermarti, corri, cazzo, non voltarti
La sirena è quella della polizia""

Chicco e Spillo saltano come due gatti sulla sella
E schizzano tuttamanetta
""Figli di puttana! Non ci prenderete mai!""
""Guarda che casino, guarda dove vai a finire, ho anche freddo
E ho paura di morire: stai attento! Stai attento! Frena!",Chicco E Spillo,1993

Ti ricordi quella velina sopra il pettine 
Ci cantavo e venivano suoni un po' kasoo 
Tu suonavi Bill Evans dicendo ""quest'uomo è un fenomeno 
certamente, ma qui ce n'è un altro e sei proprio tu"" 
E stavi lì, con me a giocare con la musica 
E pensavo, la mia vita forse è questa qui 
Ma tu giurami che un giorno suonerò così
""Suoni così bene che mi vien da ridere"" 
Era il tempo in cui cominciavo ad amar la musica 
E amavo te

Adesso sono grande, è un bel lavoro fare musica 
Sempre in giro, come adesso che sto a Napoli 
Se vedessi quanto affetto non lo immagini 
È una festa e poi sentissi come cantano 
""Che sorpresa vederti arrivare 
ma un po' ti aspettavo siediti qui
Ma da quando tu sei partito non c'è più musica 
Sta tranquillo, lo so che col tempo mi passerà
Scrivo molto ma quello che scrivo e' cosi malinconico 
Come questa canzone, chissò se ti piacerà 
Dimmi dove sei 
Suoni ancora ma per gli angeli 
E ti siederanno intorno, li farai cantare 
Suona forte cosi ti potrò sentire 
Noi quaggiù col naso in su a capire cosa sia 
Sarà il tempo in cui finalmente farai il tuo concerto, anima mia""",Gigi,2003

Samuele Bersani,"Le mie parole sono sassi 
Precisi aguzzi pronti da scagliare 
Su facce vulnerabili e indifese 
Sono nuvole sospese 
Gonfie di sottointesi 
Che accendono negli occhi infinite attese 
Sono gocce preziose indimenticate 
A lungo spasimate e poi centellinate, sono frecce infuocate che il vento o la fortuna sanno indirizzare 
Sono lampi dentro a un pozzo, cupo e abbandonato 
Un viso sordo e muto che l'amore ha illuminato 
Sono foglie cadute 
Promesse dovute 
Che il tempo ti perdoni per averle pronunciate 
Sono note stonate 
Sul foglio capitate per sbaglio 
Tracciate e poi dimenticate 
Le parole che ho detto, oppure ho creduto di dire 
Lo ammetto 
Strette tra i denti 
Passate, ricorrenti 
Inaspettate, sentite o sognate
Le mie parole son capriole 
Palle di neve al sole 
Razzi incandescenti prima di scoppiare 
Sono giocattoli e zanzare, sabbia da ammucchiare 
Piccoli divieti a cui disobbedire 
Sono andate a dormire sorprese da un dolore profondo 
Che non mi riesce di spiegare 
Fanno come gli pare 
Si perdono al buio per poi ritornare 
Sono notti interminate, scoppi di risate 
Facce sopraesposte per il troppo sole 
Sono questo le parole 
Dolci o rancorose 
Piene di rispetto oppure indecorose 
Sono mio padre e mia madre 
Un bacio a testa prima del sonno 
Un altro prima di partire 
Le parole che ho detto e chissà quante ancora devono venire
Strette tra i denti 
Risparmiano i presenti 
Immaginate, sentite o sognate 
Spade, fendenti 
Al buio sospirate, perdonate 
Da un palmo soffiate",Le Mie Parole,2005

Dubito che detto questo tu smetterai subito,
Evito di immaginare ancora quello che mi darà il vomito.

Il limite l'hai già raggiunto e ogni momento è insopportabile,
Io non ne posso più ma se reagisco allora ho smesso di combattere.

Tu hai la mia pietà
Per l'odio che ti ha
Riempito di manie
E ti perdono anche in nome di una
Mia grande libertà, non chiedo garanzie.

Conto sulle dita I passi avanti
Aspettando segni di onestà
E di risveglio, e come va?
Non va un po' meglio?

Tu hai la mia pietà
Per l'odio che ti ha
Nutrito di bugie,
Io ti perdono anche in nome di una
Mia grande libertà, le scelte sono mie.

Buono sì, però coglione no,
E tu ricordalo che aspetterò
Fino ad un certo punto e dopo non
Ti darò un'occasione per rimediare con ritardo al mio dolore

In una zaino pieno a dondolarti sopra a un treno
Arrotolato in tasca in un cappotto
Chiuso nel buio di un cassetto

Pagine unte con le briciole addosso
Cerchi olimpici di vino rosso
E una formica pietrificata del secolo scorso

Ci sono dei graffiti a coprire un fianco
Spirali ipnotiche a matita in alto
E poche righe sopravvissute a un pennarello giallo

Frage, glaubst du du schaffst es mit Rap weg vom sozialen Brennpunkt? (Was?)
Wer sagt denn, dass ich hier weg will?

Ich will nicht weg
Warum soll ich weg? (Warum soll ich weg?)
Ich find´s hier perfekt
Ich will hier nicht weg

Ich will nicht weg hier, weil ich hier alles hab
Wozu vom Block in die Skyline der Stadt?
Ihr wollt alle weg hier, ich brauche keine Villa
Hab im Hochhaus ein Wasserbett und Plasma im Zimmer
Ich will nicht weg hier, weil ich total süchtig bin
Nach meinen Leuten, die alle hier im Viertel sind
Von Kurden bis zu Russen, Türken und Afghaner
Iranern, Arabern und Afrikaner
Albanern. Natürlich habe ich die Deutschen nicht vergessen
Ich grüß die Papageiensiedlung, ihr seid die Besten
Ich will nicht weg hier, weil es hier das beste Essen gibt
Den besten Kebab und die beste Currywurst aus Rind
Ich will nicht weg, weil die Kripo mich seit 15 Jahren kennt
Prominent, woanders wär ich doch der Kripo fremd
Und wenn ihr alle sagt, es gebe nix als Dreck hier
Dann sage ich: „Haut rein, denn ich will niemals weg hier“

Ich will nicht weg
Warum soll ich weg? (Warum soll ich weg?)
Ich find´s hier perfekt
Ich will hier nicht weg
Warum soll ich weg? (Warum soll ich weg?)
Ich find´s hier perfekt
Ich will hier nicht weg

Weil ich find´s perfekt hier
Warum sollte ich weg? Ich bleibe alleine aus Respekt hier
Für Familie, Freunde und meine Stadt
Wenn´s drauf ankommt, ist das alles, was ich hab
Warum sollte ich weg von hier
Schau dich mal richtig um, alles Jackpot hier
Du kannst mit Jogginghose rausgehen
Und du brauchst dich nicht schämen
Weil die Frauen hier draußen auch so aussehen
Und je dreckiger das Hochhaus ist
Umso fetter sind die Autos, wenn du rausblickst
Ok, ich geb zu, hier gibt´s auch schlechte Zeiten
Tage, die nix als Kopfschmerzen bereiten
Und trotzdem liebe ich diese dreckige Luft
Ich geh hier nur weg, wenn ich muss
Meine Stadt Bonn und NRW
Das ist der Grund, warum ich hier nie weggeh

Ich find´s hier perfekt
Ich will hier nicht weg

Wenn ihr hier nicht weg wollt

Schmeißt die Hände in die Luft
Bonn und NRW, schmeißt eure Hände in die Luft (oh!)
Und die Straße in ganz Deutschland schreit „Alles oder Nix!“
Wenn ihr auch so lebt wie wir

Hör auf von meinem Bruder Xatar
Lass mich erst mal lesen du Vollidiot (was sagt er denn?)
Er sagt

Was läuft Jalaal es gibt neues von draußen
Fünf von den Jungs haben wir einer ist weggelaufen
Mach dir keine Sorgen, wir kriegen alle für dich
Muss Bruder wir bewahren dein Gesicht
Ansonsten ist hier draußen auch nicht viel los
Ein Leben mit Risiko sonst kommst du nie hoch
Was soll ich dir erzählen du weiß doch wie es ist
Zähl so viele Scheine du kannst bevor du sitzt
Wie sieht's drinne aus ich weiß du traust keinem
Denen, denen du traust die sind jeden Tag am Weinen
Seitdem du weg bist will die Sonne nicht mehr scheinen
Jalaal der Tag wird kommen wir werden vor lachen weinen

Wenn du raus kommst bist du ein reicher Mann
Du bist mein Auge Jalaal du bist mein Blut

Alles klar Bruder? Wie gehts es dir?
Danke Bruder mir geht es gut. Wie geht es dir Xatar? Was gibt's neues?
Muss ja. Alles in Ordnung
Komm setzt dich mal hin , ich muss dir noch was zeigen
Was gibt's denn?
Warte kurz. Haval Haval (ja bitte)
Können wir noch 2 Cay haben bitte
Kein Problem kommt sofort (dankeschön Bruder)
OK hör zu (ja)
Ich habe ein Brief bekommen von Jalaal
Ach was mach kein Scheiß
Ich schwör's dir. Zieh's dir rein

Danke Bruder für alles was du machst
Danke dass du dich um mein Familie kümmerst

Kümmer dich bitte nur um meinen Bruder

Bruder er will so sein wie wir uns viel Para machen

Desinteressiert, wer gewinnt und wer verliert?
Permanente Tränen auf Gesichtern, nicht tätowiert
Schwarzweiße Welt bunt dekoriert, Bildschirme flimmern
Reizüberflutung bis wir nichts mehr erinnern
Uhren ticken, Huren ficken, es wird schlimmer
Medizin macht krank, jeder wär' gern schlank
Leichen im Keller, Waffen im Schrank
Das Leben stirbt, wo der Tod lebt
In Großstädten, wo es zu Ende ist, bevor es losgeht
Wo Menschen Drogen nehmen, zum Verdrängen vom Problemen
Um sich beim Absturz einzubilden, dass es nach oben geht
Alles schon erlebt, alles schon gesehen, nichts neues mehr
Die Flammen sind erloschen, kein Bedarf für Feuerwehr
Wir suchen alle nach was Größerem
Soviel' Rätsel, keinerlei Lösungen

Alles hell, alles laut

Kein neuer Martin Luther King, nich' mal 'n neuer 2Pac

Kein Punkrock mehr, alles Ballade
Klingt schön, aber schade

Sag es extra laut, was auch immer ich denk', ich sprech' es aus
Was auch immer mir passiert, ich mach das Beste draus

Alles, was funktioniert, wird kopiert
Jeder, der was neues kreiert, wird ignoriert
Bis es auch funktioniert, und dann wird's kopiert

Gegen einen und meinen, sie seien auf 'nem höheren Niveau

Muss Reime sortieren und bekomm' leider keine von dir
Deshalb sprech mich nicht an, was berechtigt dich, Mann
Ich hab dich nie gesehn, nicht mal oberflächlich gekannt

Aber dies Etablissement hier ist für uns beide zu klein
Also kritisiert bitte nicht mal eine der Zeilen
Sonst komm' ich zurück mit noch viel gemeineren Reimen

Schreib' Styles für mich selbst und scheiß' auf alle anderen
Einer von denen die dir auf Partys Aspirin als E verkauft
Für fast ehrliches Geld, was von uns heutzutage jeder braucht
Du findst' es eher später raus, bis dahin auf dem Mega-Rausch
Machst Party bis du umfällst keuchst wie nach'm 1000-Meter-Lauf
Mongo Star, Digger, wir kriegen nie genug, ham' immernoch ein miesen Spruch
Sind bekannt für Hausfriedensbruch, denn wir holen uns kein' Anwalt
Wir wenden Gewalt an und zwar bald man, du willst kein' Beef sei nich albern
Denn jetzt is es offiziell also sag's deiner Posse schnell
Der Typ is wieder da der sich schon für larger als Puffy hält
Zwar nich annähernd soviel Geld aber auch ohne Mos Def
Der die seltene Story tellt, aber in Sachen Flows Chef

Samsemillia am Mic, also check das ab
Dynamite is an den Beats, ich sag check das ab

Alle wussten es immer schon, ich bin ein Naturtalent
So'n Spinner der Termine um egal-wie-viel-Uhr verpennt
Leute bilden 'n Kreis um mich, kaum betret ich die Szene
Ob ich Breaker bin? Nein, ich vermeide bloß jede Hygiene
Denk bei jeder Sirene sie kommen wegen mir und fang an zu rennen
Werd' deshalb dann gestoppt, gefilzt, gezwungen meinen Namen zu nennen
Der übliche Verdächtige, egal wohin ich komm'
Zollbeamte, Bullen und Bundesgrenzschutz kennen mich schon
Der Deluxe-Smoker, der's so mies drauf, dass er dich sogar disst
Wenn du ihm'n paar Props gibst wie dope er ist
Der auf seinem Sofa sitzt und über sich selbst schreibt
Euch sein Bild von der Welt zeigt und seid sicher die Skills sind tight
Das is Competition und alle im Raum wissen
Mein' Sound dissen is' wie gegen'n elektrischen Zaun pissen
Weil ich vor Ort klär', vom Wortwert her, burn ich'n Literat
Mal' jedem Unsympath auf sein Scheisstourplakat einen Hitlerbart
Hab massig neuen Shit parat, weil ich noch niemals fitter war
Obwohl ich wenn's um Sport geht eigentlich nichts außer Ritter mag
Bin Langschläfer, Angeber, 'n ätzender Typ
Persönlich kannst du mich hassen, doch meine Raps sind der Shit

'Ne ganze Strophe für die Heads,ich sage check das ab

Ich liebe mich selbst, und weiß, dass du's für widerlich hältst
Aber am Mic biete ich Skills und so krieg ich Deals
Damit verdien' ich mein Cash und so kauf' ich mir Weed
Rauch einen und bin raus bevor mich die Aufsicht hier sieht
Schlender rum und check aus was in der City so geht
Quatsch mich fest und vergess mein eigenen Videodreh
Schreib' dafür diesen hit, und sag' meinem Label es darf mir später danken
Wenn der Scheiß dann abgeht, wie Körperteile bei Leprakranken
Punchlines hart wie Schlägerbanden, die die Charts aufmischen
Und warum das so ist? Weil die Aggressionen raus müssen
Erwachsene hassen mich, weil ich ständig von Ganja laber
Nennen mich 'nen Neandertaler, prolliger als Manta Fahrer
Ein hammerharter Mongo, der keinerlei Moral kennt
Der in dein Stammlokal rennt und sich den Kegelpokal nimmt
Man hört ihn auf Rap-Beats, kennt die Fresse vom Steckbrief
Einer von den Gestörten, der vor Behörden stets weglief
Also petz es bei deinen Detectives, Wachmeister oder Kommissar
Stürm in den Bundestag, schrei, dass ich 'ne Bombe Hab
Und lass die „Grauen Köpfe“ erst 'ne weile Schreien

Samy Deluxe,"Yeah
Das hier ist ein Song über Liebe

Das erste mal ging es mit wie Boris Becker: Bin ich schon drin?
Gleich ein schlimmer Beginn
Du sagtest: „Ist nicht so schlimm“
Ich hatte schon oft von diesem Ort gehört, aber mir kam nicht in den Sinn
Dass ich so jemanden wie dich hier drin find
Die ganzen anderen Frauen vor dir wollten nur Spiele mit mir spielen
Die mir nicht gefielen, deshalb wusste ich von Liebe nicht mehr viel
Bis du kamst
Ich hab dich angeschaut und nicht lang gebraucht um es zu verstehen
Keine andere Frau so souverän, keine andere Frau so gut aussehend
Keine andere Frau so leicht abzuschalten mit nur einem Knopfdruck
Und das für einen Typen wie mich, dem jeder mal ein Tag auf den Kopf spuckt
Dessen Meinung nie gefragt ist und wenn ich sie sag, hört keiner zu (was hast du gesagt?)
Ich wollt mir schon das Leben nehmen, aber da standest auf einmal du
Hast mich vollkommen therapiert und das in grade einer Nacht
Und in mein graues Leben wieder 'n bisschen Farbe reingebracht
Standest plötzlich da und batest mich näher zu kommen
Und so hat die Affäre begonnen

Ich hatte noch nie 'ne Frau wie dich
Ohne Körper, ohne Gesicht
Die nur auf Bildschirm zu mir spricht
Und trotzdem lieb ich dich
Du hast mir meinen Kopf verdreht
So wie es all deinen Opfern geht
Was hast du mir noch mehr zu bieten, Baby?
Du hast Chatrooms, du hast Websites
So kann ich jedem meine Meinung sagen weltweit
Ich fühl mich plötzlich wie ein besserer Mensch
Aber bin froh, dass draußen keiner meine Fresse erkennt

Mit uns zwei ging es ziemlich schnell
Bald war alles offiziell
Standesamt hieß AOL
Wir reisten um die ganze Welt
Du hast so viele Seiten und wenn mir mal eine nicht gefällt
Dann hast du gleich die Links mit denen ich mich auf die nächste wähl
Durch dich lern' ich Leute kennen, du machst mir Connections klar
Befriedigst mich total, und dabei haben wir noch nie Sex gehabt
Und ich weiß noch letztes Jahr, starb ich fast vor Selbstmitleid
Dann kamst du und hast mir diese vollkommen neue Welt gezeigt
Ich fühl mich wie im Paradies und wohn im Industriegebiet
Und deshalb sitz' ich hier und schreibe dir jetzt dieses Liebeslied
Denn ich hatte noch nie eine Frau wie dich
Und ich bin fast vierzig, traurig, nich'?
Und durch dich lern ich im Netz Millionen Loser kennen, genau wie mich

Ich hatte noch nie 'ne Frau wie dich
Ohne Körper, ohne Gesicht
Die nur auf Bildschirm zu mir spricht
Und trotzdem lieb ich dich
Du hast mir meinen Kopf verdreht
So wie es all deinen Opfern geht
Was hast du mir noch mehr zu bieten, Baby?
Du hast Chatrooms, du hast Websites
So kann ich jedem meine Meinung sagen weltweit
Ich fühl mich plötzlich wie ein besserer Mensch
Aber bin froh, dass draußen keiner meine Fresse erkennt

Du hast Chatrooms, du hast Websites
So kann ich jedem meine Meinung sagen weltweit
Ich fühl mich plötzlich wie ein besserer Mensch
Aber bin froh das draußen keiner meine Freese erkennt

Ich hab dich nur einmal angemacht
Und du, du hast mich um meinen Verstand gebracht
Komm, Baby, wir surfen um die ganze Welt
Ich hab die Sachen schon zusammengepackt, yeah

Ich muss nicht mit dir essen gehen
Brauch nicht mit dir fernzusehen
Schalt dich aus, wenn du mich nervst
Und zwing dich so mich ernst zu nehmen
Muss dich weder durchfüttern
Noch ständig einkleiden
Alles was du mich kostest sind paar Telefoneinheiten

Ich hab dich nur einmal angemacht
Und du, du hast mich um meinen Verstand gebracht
Komm, Baby, wir surfen um die ganze Welt
Ich hab die Sachen schon zusammengepackt

Komm, Baby
Wir beide

Ihr ganzen klein idoten habt bald'n großes Problem!
Ich sag' ihr habt'n großes Problem!

Was interessiert mich der ein oder andere gute MC?
Ich bin der Super-MC, der absolute MC
Der komplette MC, perfekte MC, Battle-MC
Sam Semilia! Immer noch um Längen besser als ihr
Ich krieg von euch ganzen Blendern fast 'ne Rap-Allergie
Ihr burnt? Wo is'n tighterer Flow, wo'n fetterer Beat?
Ihr könnt's behaupten so oft ihr noch wollt, aber ich glaub's nicht
Im Plattenläden liegt auf eurem Fach 'ne fette Staubschicht
Die Rap-Aufsicht
Ja, ich hab eure Fehler notiert
Eure zwölf Inches werden nie auf meinem 1210er rotieren
Nicht nur, weil jeder kopiert, sondern weil keiner's richtig hinkriegt
Ihr meint, ihr habt Styles? Stimmt nicht, in diesem Punkt bin ich empfindlich
Diese verbalen zweckentfremdeten Second-Hand Schneckenrennen
Dürftet ihr nicht mal rappen nennen
Hätte ich's vorher checken können
Und ich muß euch Typen wecken wenn ihr tagträumt und sag Moin!
Denn auch in Zukunft werde ich hier die Props abräum!
Der Eimsbüttler Mic-Athlet, der beim Schreiben am Zeiger dreht
Euch um Jahre voraus ist, deshalb allein in seinem Cypher steht
Denn der einzig andere MC, dem ich Props am Mikrofon gebe
Ist er: Wenn ich grad von mir in der dritten Person rede

Ihr solltet euch nicht noch tiefer in die Scheiße reinreiten
Geht lieber zu Mama nach Haus und holt euch Streicheleinheiten
Ihr könnt die geilsten Reime schreiben, aber solange ihr mich kopiert
Erwartet nix von mir, außer daß ich euch weiter ignorier
Denn ich bin unglaublich, ihr seid unglaubwürdig
Könnt überhaupt nichts und nervt unaufhörlich
Braucht euch nur das Mic zu nehmen und sagen: one, two
Dann halt ich mir mit meinen Kollegen schon die Ohren zu
Es ist bitter wie Schweppes, doch ihr hättet es wissen müssen
Ich top' zehn eurer Rap-Hits mit nur einem von meinen Zwischenstücken
Mich kotzt dieses beschissene Land und dieses Business an
Überall nur Idioten und competition is none
Deutsch-rap? Ich pass' nicht in diese Kategorie
Wenn man sich umschaut, kommt's einem vor als wenn man Muppet-Show sieht
Nur Marionetten, die gerne Hits im Radio hätten
Und gibt's mal einen mit Style, dann gibt es gleich ein paar, die so rappen

Ihr habt Hits? Echt?
Ihr kriegt 'nen Drops? Von wem?
Ihr wollt mich battlen? Is nich' wahr

Hört auf zu rappen, ich hab' euch das Mic nicht gegeben!
Ihr Honks solltet euch schnellstens zurück an den Schreibtisch bewegen
Wieso mussten Big L und Biggie bloß das Zeitliche segnen?
Und Ihr seid noch am Leben und haltet hier peinliche Reden
Ich hör' jetzt viele der Kleinen meinen, ihr hättet die derbste Clique
Doch hängt euch an mein Bein und wagt selbst keine ersten Schritte
Ihr wisst gar nicht, auf was für'm Level ich hier Battle-Texte kicke
Bei mir geht's alle vier Takte, wie beim Doktor nur: Der Nächste bitte!
Bis MCs sich zu Hause verstecken
Und sich Gruppen noch schneller auflösen als Brausetabletten
Egal wie lange ihr versucht genauso zu rappen: Es klappt nicht!
Ich burn euch Lappen und das ist nicht mal meine Absicht
Denn ich kenn eure Platten nicht, aber ihr anscheinend meine
Denn ihr habt ähnliche Flows und ihr habt ähnliche Reime
Und ich vergleich mich nicht mit euch, aber ihr euch scheinbar mit mir
Sonst würdet ihr nicht ständig meinen Namen nennen und mich zitieren
Wer ist der Shit hier? Sam Semilia ist der Shit hier!
Und wer rockt den Shit hier? Mein Mann Tropf rockt den Shit hier!
Ihr ganzen kleinen Hater wollt doch selbst alle wie Sam klingen
Doch ich burn euch wie Branding und bin draußen wie Camping

Du solltest Schluss machen, obwohl ihr euch blendend versteht
Wenn dieser Typ aussieht, als sei er von einem fremden Planet
Sein Outfit darauf schließen lässt, dass dieser weit hinterm Mond ist
Aber du denkst, dass du - weil er verloren hat - Finderlohn kriegst
Du weißt, es ist Zeit, die Beziehung zu beenden, wenn's so weit ist
Dass du immer auf den gleichen Kleinigkeiten rumreitest
Dich ständig streitest, aber verzeihst, obwohl du sogar weißt
Der ganze Stress für so'n Kleinscheiß ist ein zu großer Preis
Du solltest Schluss machen, wenn du neben deinem Freund liegst
Gern Sex hättest und er sich unter der Decke einen wichst
Mach Schluss, wenn ihr die Gegenwart verdrängt wegen der Vergangenheit
Mach Schluss, wenn er in Urlaub nach Dänemark mit 'nem Mann reist
Mach Schluss ganz ohne Grund, nur weil alle jetzt darüber reden
Oder du findst 'n Grund, denn dies Lied hier bringt dich zum Überlegen
Und sag auch all deinen Freundinnen, dass sie Schluss machen sollen
Bevor die Eulen sich vor Frustration noch Schusswaffen holen
Denn es gibt nun mal Fälle, in denen Menschen nicht zusammenpassen
Deshalb sag ich: Schluss mit all den krampfhaften Bekanntschaften
Beziehungen und Ehen, ich will sowas nicht sehen

Mach lieber Schluss, wenn du zwar auf sie flasht, wenn ihr Drogen nehmt
Doch vor deinen Jungs musst du dich für sie stets in Grund und Boden schäm'
Du musst dich trennen, ich weiß es ist hart
Aber bring's hinter dich
Wenn du noch tausend Frauen willst und sie ständig von Kindern spricht
Mach einfach Schluss, wenn du meinst, deine Frau behindert dich
Und du weißt, obwohl sie hübsch ist, innerlich stimmt was nicht
Genauso musst du dich trennen, wenn du rausfindest
Du hast zwar 'ne Beziehung, aber weniger Sex als Singles
Okay, wenn du sie liebst, dann bleib mit ihr zusammen, aber, damn
Sie ist hässlich wie Marla Glen du musst es doch mal erkennen
So fett, dass sie im Sitzen schwitzt wie ich nach'm Sechs-Tage-Rennen
Und von ihrem zweiten Doppelkinn hat sie fettige Haare hängen
Ich gebe es zu, auch ich hab mal 'ne Stimme gehört

Dass andere ihre Emotionen so toll auf 'n Punkt bringen
Achja, ich versteh'! Und jetzt bin ich der Dümmere
Nur weil ich mich nicht ständig um so 'n Pussy-Scheiß kümmere
Nicht ganz so viel rumjammere wie andere
Und lieber Themen, die mich selber interessieren, behandele

„Nein, ich meine: Kannst du nicht mal über was Nettes reden?“
Nein, Rap ist eben Competition, es wird immer Battles geben

Rapper, die tun als würden sie alles besser wissen
„Aber wieso wirst du denn nicht wenigstens Story-Teller?“
Nun ja, ich bau grad an 'ner Atombombe in meinem Hobby-Keller

Als könnten sie selbst auf die Bühne gehen und Konzerte geben
Doch habt noch nie gerapt, getanzt, gecuttet oder Züge gemalt
Könnt nur phänomenal lügen und prahlen
Nach dem Feedback von Jungs wie euch und Reportern, die mich interviewten
Erinnert mich Hip Hop Kultur in Deutschland eher an Hitlerjugend
Zu viele Dogmatiker, die nix wissen, wie Kleinkinder
Die nicht gute Musik wollen, sondern gemeinsame Feindbilder
Die down waren bei dem Demo und der limited Edition

Aber hör schon wieder Stories, dass Berliner mich hassen
Nur weil ich sag', Hamburg ruled, und sie meine Lieder nicht raffen
Vielen da draußen ist das ganze zu stresslos
Hetzen Städte gegeneinander auf wie East- und Westcoast
Und das bestätigt: In euren Köpfen herrscht gähnende Leere
Und ich schäm mich, dass ich zu so'ner Szene gehöre
Denn eigentlich sollte gerade Hip Hop etwas Positives sein
Denn ich allein steck in diesen Scheiß schon so viel Liebe rein
Wisst ihr, wie ich mein? Ihr braucht nicht so aggressiv zu sein
Für grundlose Streitereien ist dieses Land viel zu klein
Doch Typen kommen mit miesen Reimen, wollen Respekt, aber kriegen keinen

Kommt alle auf einmal, ich diss euch vom ersten zum letzten
Mit den perversesten Texten, den härtesten Sätzen
Ihr könnt mich ja bei der Behörde verpetzen, ihr Lappen
Ihr seid bloß Penner, die permanent penetrieren
Aber nichts können, deshalb lasst mich in Ruh
Und wenn ihr nicht respektiert was ich hier tu
Dann war ich wohl noch nicht assig genug
Ooh

Viele meinen ich sei cool
Sagen ich rap so schnell
Feiern mich wie ein' Held
Finden mich sensationell
Andere sagen ich wär'
Nur ein Blender, nicht mehr
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Viele meinen ich sei tight
Jeder Song den ich schreib
Man ich burn alle live
Und sie komm' klar auf den Vibe
Andere sagen ich wär
Nur ein Poser, nicht mehr
Dj Mixwell hört alle mal her

Heute denken die Kids, sie checken die ganze Welt per Internet
Doch ich rolle mit Hip Hop wie Robbe für alle
Die immer noch down sind mit dem Shit
Kritiker labern, als hätten sie'n Plan
Aber die Typen haben nix kapiert
Denn der Rap und der Beat in der Kombination sind der Shit
Was wollt ihr Wichser hier?
Heute will doch jeder Trottel nur Geld
Am besten natürlich noch doppelt so schnell
Verbreitet auf Platte sein Papperlapapp
Bis man ihn dann beim Verplappern ertappt
Und alle meinen immer, wie locker sie kommen
Doch wenn sie auf Bühnen stehen, stottern sie rum
Ich hoffe, ihr habt mich inzwischen erkannt
Den Typ auf'm Cover mit'm Spliff in der Hand
Denn ich will lieber chilliger leben
Und weniger reden und kauf in billigen Läden
Statt immer nur JA zu schreien
Um mit Cash am Start zu sein und ein Star zu sein
Ich gebe euch andern ein Jahr zum feilen
Dann könnt ihr wiederkommen mit 'nen paar fetteren Tracks
Nen paar besseren Raps, mit Swing und Flow und Groove
Und auch mal'm cleveren Text
Viele sagen: „Ey, Sam, dein Style ist gemein“
Laber mich nicht voll, mein Style ist alles in einem
Komm mit den tightesten Reimen und dem wickeden Flow
Andere kommen hintenrum wie beim Ficken in'n Po
Aber hier hat keiner von euch Affen 'ne Chance
Wir haben die passenden Songs setzen Massen in Trance
Hier ist Samy Deluxe am Mikrofon
Ohoh, mit meinem Mann Tropf an den Beats, ohoh!

Viele meinen ich sei cool
Sagen ich rap so schnell
Feiern mich wie ein' Held
Finden mich sensationell
Andere sagen ich wär'
Nur ein Blender, nicht mehr
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Viele meinen ich sei tight

Samy Deluxe,"Das ist hier die Session
Jungs, seid ihr bereit für die Session? (Auf jeden Fall)
Aha, ja! Ich bin bereit für die Session
Gib mir mal jemand 'n Joint
Dann bin ich auch breit für die Session
Seid ihr bereit für die Session? (Wir sind bereit für die Session)
Ich fang mal so an (ja, fang mal so an)
Hier kommen vier von Deutschlands großen MCs
Augen sind rot, Hosen hängen tief
Samy, Dendemann, Illo und Nico am Mikro
Mit Niveau und viel Flow, kapito, Amigo?

Die gelbe Trikotfarbe gehört nur Nico Suave
Schon klar, dass ich spontan bei dem Beat zusage
Jetzt Spaß beiseite, ich bring phasenweise Texte
So effektiv, dass Wack-MCs die Straßenseite wechseln

Jungs, ich setzt euch 'ne Deadline
Auf drei müsst ihr weg sein
Eins, drei - Pech gehabt! Ich bin halt 'n Dreckschwein
Feilen an Textzeilen
Bis sie glatt sind wie Speckstein
Rhyme fresh fresh Rhymes
So auf Flash kann nur Ress sein

Hey, check mein', ich bleibe, auch wenn ich hier nur störe
Um so zu tun, als ob das ganze Land nur mir gehöre
Denn wir vier Tenöre plus Joni Rewind
Sagen: „Lass dein' Scheiß doch da, wo die Sonne nicht scheint!“
Seid ihr bereit für die Session?

Ich bin bereit für die Session
Nico, bereit für die Session?

Ich bin bereit für die Session
Dende, bereit für die Session?

Ja, ich bin bereit für die Session
Und wenn ihr's nicht glaubt
Kann ich das Mic ein zweites Mal testen:
Wenn du wie ich Reime kickst
Und dafür Scheine kriegst
Gehörten diese vorher meist großen und kleinen Kids
Und jeder der denkt, dafür braucht man keine Tricks
Ist leider noch schiefer gewickelt als meine Sticks

Sticks und ich schreibe Hits, während ich auf Klo beim Scheißen sitz'
Rhyme deluxe, weil die Muse mich küsst und mir einen wichst
Heißt eigentlich gibt's zum Meckern hier kaum'n Grund
Bring's auf'n Punkt, und MCs hören dies mit dem Daumen im Mund

Ich sehe nur nen Haufen Schund, schau mich um, glaub' es kaum:
Nur tausend Clowns - von mir gibt's ne Faust frei Haus exakt aufs Auge drauf
Unsere Gigs sind ausverkauft, ihr seid da nie aufgetaucht
Und wenn doch?
Habt ihr euch nie zu uns da oben raufgetraut

Ich hab auch geglaubt, dass die Jungs keinen Mumm haben
Du kannst liebend gern rumfragen
Den Typen fehlen Grundlagen
Wie zum Beispiel Micdisziplin
Es wird Zeit, dass wir Ihnen zeigen
Beim Zeilen Schreiben
Dass wir tight sind im Team
Seid ihr bereit für 'ne Session?

Ich bin bereit für 'ne Session
Dende, bereit für 'ne Session?

Ich bin bereit für die Session
Sam, bereit für 'ne Session?

Bin ich bereit für 'ne Session?
Ich bin nicht nur bereit, ich besteh' drauf weiterzurappen:
Ich könnt wetten, dass hier bald jeder von euch Deppen kapiert
Dass ihr scheiße ausseht wie benutztes Toilettenpapier
Nachdem ich euch in alter Battle-Manier
Die Fresse polier'
Und wieder echten Rap etablier', Sam Semi!

Und jetzt hätten wir auch schon 'n triftigen Grund
Auf dass wir den Stift nehmen und dann die Schrift in den Mund
Kauen sie gut durch und spucken sie wieder aus
Und bringen dann bestenfalls die Reste als sowas wie Lieder raus

Yo, der Beat erlaubt's, ich attackier mit smoothem Rap
Junge träum schön weiter vom Plattendeal bei Groove Attack
Ich appelliere für'n guten Zweck an die wahre Szene
Und plakatier': „Steckt Wannabes in Quarantäne“

Da klappern Zähne reihenweise, vor allem wenn ich mich einschalte
Euch Lappen die Klamotten klau' und meine Jungs neu einkleide
Wenn ich euch jetzt einheize und ans nackte Bein scheiße
Gleicht das einem Fallschirmsprung mit gekappter Reißleine
Bereit für die Session?

Ich bin bereit für die Session
Und selbst bereit für die Session?

Ich bin bereit für die Session

Ist noch einer von den drei Gästen bereit für die Session?

Jawohl, ich bin so weit bereit und geb' noch einen zum Besten:
Vorsicht! Es gibt ein bisschen Action am Mic
Die Session zu viert hat den meisten jetzt schon gereicht
Ich schick' dir im Nu drei Jungs vorbei, wenn du mit Kontra gibst
Glaub ja nicht, es sei 'was Besonderes, wovon du sprichst

Ich bin hart am Platz wie Zahnersatz, ein Labersack
Der Partner hat, sich gerade macht mit drei MCs
Die wissen wie der Hase tanzt
Verpassen euch 'n Wadenkrampf
Stecken voller Tatendrang
Das Instrumental in Brand
Und richten im Land Schaden an

Ey, Warte Mann, ich hab zwar schon ganze Shows verpennt
Bloß wer denkt, ich sei deshalb nicht schneller als ein Toaster brennt
Der hat jetzt mehr zu verlieren als Hopfen und Malz
Ich hau' euch mit brutalen Ritualen den Kopf in den Hals

Wir sind für's Rauchen und Saufen und Klauen statt Kaufen bekannt
Hängen auf'n Haufen zusammen und labern Mist am laufenden Band
Erfinden Geschichten, weil eh alles falsch nach außen gelangt
Freestylen schon und vertauschen die Namen
Und verkaufen den Kram
Ja, ich denk das war's mit der Session

Ich denk das war's mit der Session
Suave, du noch Bock zu flashen?

Ne, keine Lust
Illo, hast du noch Bock zu rappen?

Ne, Jungs ich bin bedient
Ich hab Bock auf 'was zu Essen",Session,2001
Samy Deluxe,"Ich sende direkt aus dem Busch per Buschfunk
Meiner Frequenz mit dem qualitativen Pluspunkt
Die Kids machen 'n Luftsprung, die Alten schreien: Igittigitt!
Denn ich bring all die dreckigen Styles aus Hamburg City mit
Samsemi on air, live wie'n Konzert
Gib das Mikrofon her! Dann geht da schon mehr
Oh yeah! Und auch wenn es nicht so wär'
Würd ich es sagen, nur damit ihr einmal den Flow hört
Doch ihr liebt den Scheiß, egal ob ich freestyle oder Lieder schreib
Und wisst jedes Frühjahr, bald ist es wieder Zeit
Neue Platte, Solo, doch immer noch die gleiche Crew
Gleiches Motto heißt: Ich frage nicht, ich greife zu
Es wird nix nützen, auf Holz zu klopfen
Denn ich komm, um mir meine Taschen vollzustopfen
So dirty und lowdown, ich flirte mit Klofraun
Die mir wegen den hängenden Jeans auf meinen Po schaun
Besitz das Know-How, wie Raps in Flow baut
Somit allen andern Rappern an dem Abend die Show klaut
Zu laut! Und ich hoffe, dass die Sache jetzt klar ist
Samy Deluxe, Afrob, mit der Platte des Jahres!

Das habt ihr nicht erwartet, so soll's sein
Alle Leute ohne Liebe in sich, ich sag: Fickt euch doch
Deine Ziele waren groß, du wolltest hoch, doch du bist gefallen
Samy Deluxe zurück, wieder mit Hits, ich sag: Das ist laut

Ich dichte wie'n Kranker, lichte die Anker, und Leinen los
Mit Rhyme-Flows, die du nicht annähernd einholst
Schreib Seiten voll und Stifte leer
Jemand besser als wir? Nicht, dass ich wüsste wer!
Hör sich einmal einer diesen Mongo an
Geboren mit noch mehr Charme als Don Juan
Gepisst wegen dem zu niedrigen Kontostand
Bin ich immer noch am Meckern, denn das kommt gut an
Dafür sind andere MCs jetzt abgefuckt
Wie tight der Typ die Texte auf Takte packt
Das Ding dabei: Ich hab nicht mal nachgedacht
Sie nur nach ner durchgemachten Nacht aufs Blatt gebracht
Was geht ab? Dies hier ist extra für euch
Ihr wurdet von zu vielen Rappern in deutsch bitter enttäuscht
Zwar haben alle jetzt tolle teure Video-Clips
Aber ist das ein Ausgleich für alle die billigen Hits?
Hier kommt der Meister der Zeremo mit der Terror-Flow
Engländer sagen: splendid!, Amis: incredible!
Hamburger sagen: derbe! Franzosen: très bien!
Und jetzt wird es noch mal Zeit für den Refrain

Das habt ihr nicht erwartet, so soll's sein
Alle Leute ohne Liebe in sich, ich sag: Fickt euch doch
Deine Ziele waren groß, du wolltest hoch, doch du bist gefallen
Samy Deluxe zurück, wieder mit Hits, ich sag: Das ist laut

Hier kommt das Reime-Monster, gegen das ihr keine Chance habt
Wenn ihr mich nicht kennt, dann geht in'n Laden und checkt meine Songs ab
Und hört euch den MC an. Den Champion
Weil keiner am Mic kann, so wie's Samy kann. (Du kennst ihn, man)
Ich rap nicht für Sänger, Models und Schauspieler
Ich rap für Penner, Volltrottel und Hauptschüler
Rap nicht für Celebrities aus der High Society
Ich bin ein rude boy, piss an dein Polizeirevier
Krieg sogar Props von Häftlingen, das ich def kling
Und der Chef bin in diesem verbalen Wrestling
Und deswegen mach' ich am Mic so auf Dicken
Denn die Jungs komm'n bald raus, und ich hab sie im Rücken
Spaß beiseite, dies ist bitterer Ernst
In Sachen Rap könnt ihr noch von Euren Müttern was lernen
Ich übernehm Bühnen, bring Typen ab vom MCn
Denn sie wissen nicht was sie tun, wie James Dean
Tropf kommt mit den Loops, dem Beat und dem Bass
Mein Mann Afrob macht den Hook, du fragst: Wie geht denn das?
Ganz einfach, Mann. Die echten Styler halten zusammen
Und hier sind zwei von den tightesten mit dem Mic in der Hand

Das habt ihr nicht erwartet, so soll's sein
Alle Leute ohne Liebe in sich, ich sag: Fickt euch doch
Deine Ziele waren groß, du wolltest hoch, doch du bist gefallen
Samy Deluxe zurück, wieder mit Hits, ich sag: Das ist laut",So Soll's Sein,2001
Samy Deluxe,"SOS! SOS! SOS! SOS!

Ich seh' zu wenig Liebe, alles wirkt lieblos
Leblos wie'n Friedhof, obwohl draußen ein Krieg tobt
Und das einzige, was die Menschen noch teilen, ist Hoffnung
Dass morgen alles besser wird, alles wieder in Ordnung
Gib bloß Acht, die Gedanken der Meisten sind boshaft
Und all' diese Neopropheten verkünden 'ne falsche Botschaft
Vor allem hier, in der Großstadt, wo der Rohstoff des Hasses herkommt
Für die, die's nich' wahrhaben wollen: Neid und Gier sind der Schwerpunkt
Alle wollen nur noch mehr von all dem Scheiß aus der Werbung
Leben nach Klischees und nicht nach der eigenen Bewertung
Ich seh' Menschen ziellos pilgern. Menschen, die keinen Willen haben
Menschen, die 'n härteren Film fahren als andere, die zu viel Pillen nahmen
Die fast nix sehen, doch an den Gläsern sparen statt an den Brillenrahmen
Deshalb nie im Bild waren, gestresst, weil sie nie zum Chillen kamen
Keine Angst vor'm Tod, aber Angst bis hin zum Tod zu leben
Angst aus der Masse hervorzutreten um das Niveau zu heben
Und so sieht's aus in allen großen Städten
Viele, die denken wie ich, doch wenige, die sich trauen so zu reden
Scheiße, Mann, alles hier ist traurig und grau
Ich werd' aus dieser Scheiße auch nich' mehr schlau

Und deshalb sende ich ein SOS
Über der Stadt liegt ein grauer Schleier
Leben hier is'n Widerspruch in sich wie'ne Trauerfeier
Und in dieser kaputten Welt spielen Musiker jetzt Bauarbeiter
Versuchen was zu ändern, aber das dauert leider
SOS! Über der Stadt liegt ein grauer Schleier
Leben hier is'n Widerspruch in sich wie 'ne Trauerfeier
Und in dieser kaputten Welt spielen Musiker jetzt Bauarbeiter
Versuchen was zu ändern, aber, aber

Ich hör' schon wie der ein' oder andere der Hip Hop Heads sagt:
Was geht'n jetzt ab? Hat Sam nun die Battle-Raps satt?
Nein, was ihr hier seht, gleicht eher einer Hetzjagd
Der Stift ist nach meinen Gedanken vor mir auf meinem Textblatt
Zeig' euch mein Bild von der Situation und zwar exakt
Dies' Land trägt 'ne schwere Last auf sein' Schultern wie'n Fettsack
Und trotzdem behandelt man Fremde hier wie's letzte Dreckspack
Nennt mich Kanacke und sperrt mich ein, wenn ich nich' Recht hab'!
Ich hör' Politiker reimen, sie wollen lieber Kinder statt Inder
Und ich werd' kritisiert, nur weil Mongo an Behinderte erinnert
Und sie diskriminiert
Ihr Leute habt noch immer keinen Schimmer
Die Welt wird nich' durch mich, sondern durch diese Spinner nur schlimmer
Ich bin nur Berichterstatter, diese alten grauen Krawattenträger
Sind die Attentäter, schaufeln da draußen die Massengräber
Vergessen die Jugend über ihr globales Kräftemessen
Behandeln uns mit Desinteresse und lassen uns die Reste essen
Geben uns nur materielle Ziele zum Anstreben
Fördern Protzen und Angeben mehr als smoothes Zusammenleben
Unterdrücken Kreativität, wollen unsere Kunst lahm legen
In Endlos-Konferenzen noch die letzten Lügen wahr reden
Erforschen andere Planeten, kürzen dafür Schuletat
Stecken Milliarden in Millitär, holen mehr Bullen und Securitas
Installieren Kameras, so wird die Überwachung hergestellt
Und BigBrother sieht euch öfter als ihr den Scheiß auf RTL

Und deshalb sende ich ein SOS
Über der Stadt liegt ein grauer Schleier
Leben hier is'n Widerspruch in sich wie'ne Trauerfeier
Und in dieser kaputten Welt spielen Musiker jetzt Bauarbeiter
Versuchen was zu ändern, aber das dauert leider
SOS! Über der Stadt liegt ein grauer Schleier
Leben hier is'n Widerspruch in sich wie 'ne Trauerfeier
Und in dieser kaputten Welt spielen Musiker jetzt Bauarbeiter
Versuchen was zu ändern, aber, aber

Ich musst' auf hart erfahren, dass wir in 'nem geizigen Land leben
Viele wollten mir nicht mal 'n Blick schenken oder 'ne Hand geben
Es hat sich überhaupt nichts verbessert
In manchen Gegenden wird man als Schwarzer immer noch angestarrt wie'n scheiß Alien
Jetzt seht ihr neben mir blass aus, Jungs, nicht nur wegen der Hautfarbe
Sondern wegen dem, was ich drauf habe und bei Aufnahmen aussage
Die ganzen alten Wichser, 's is' nix mehr, wie's früher war
Meine Generation brauch' Motivation und kein' Führer
Ich hab' doch sogar schon im Fernsehen mit euch diskutiert
Ihr ganzen scheiß Politiker wisst alle nix von mir
Denkt wahrscheinlich, die Menschen seien noch Jäger und Sammler
Dabei sind alle, die ich kenn', Langschläfer und Gammler
Verdammt, Mann!",SOS,2001
