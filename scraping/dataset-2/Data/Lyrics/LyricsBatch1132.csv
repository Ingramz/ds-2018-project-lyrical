Bill Holcombe,"Hmm, c'est si bon 
Lovers say that in France 
When they thrill to romance 
It means that it's so good 

Oh, c'est si bon
So I say it to you 
Like the French people do 
Because it's oh-so good, ba-ba-doo, doo day

Every word, every sigh
Every kiss, dear 
Leads to only one thought 
And it's this, dear!
 
Hmm, it's so good
Nothing else can replace 
Just your slightest embrace 
And if you only would
Be my own
For the rest of my days 
I will whisper this phrase 
My darling, c'est si bon, oui oui!",C'est Si Bon [It's So Good],1952
Bill Holiday,"Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And I am livin' for you alone
Did I remember to say
I'm lost without you
And just how mad about you I've grown
You were in my arms
And that was all I knew
We were alone, we two
What did I say to you
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And pray forevermore you'll be mine
[Repeat]",Did I Remember?,2001
Bill Holman,"Now won't you listen honey, while I say, 
How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart 

You know I've loved you for these many years, 
Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears? 
Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad
You're gonna feel bad
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
But baby, think what you're doin'
I'm gonna haunt you so, I'm gonna taunt you so
It's gonna drive you to ruin
After you've gone, after you've gone away.",After You've Gone,1958
Bill Holman,"I remember holdin' on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

I only miss you here every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowin up from the Carribean
Most Novembers I break down and cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye",Goodbye,1958
Bill Holman,"I hadn't anyone till you,
I was a lonely one 'til you,
I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be
A someone in the wide world just made for me,
Now I see

I had to save my love for you, (I saved my love for you)
I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I kept my love in secrecy,
I put it under lock and key,
I had to save my love for you!
I never gave my love away,
I waited for that lucky day
When I could give it to you

And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.",I Hadn't Anyone Till You,1959
Bill Holman,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1959
Bill Holman,"Isn't she lovely 
Isn't she wonderful 
Isn't she precious 
Less than one minute old 
I never thought through love we'd be 
Making one as lovely as she 
But isn't she lovely made from love 
Isn't she pretty 
Truly the angel's best 
Boy, I'm so happy 
We have been heaven blessed 
I can't believe what God has done 
Through us he's given life to one 
But isn't she lovely made from love 
Isn't she lovely 
Life and love are the same 
Life is Aisha 
The meaning of her name 
Londie, it could have not been done 
Without you who conceived the one 
That's so very lovely made from love",Isn't She Lovely,1987
Bill Holman,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,1987
Bill Holman,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,1992
Bill Holman,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1995
Bill Holman,"I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.
I'd love to turn you on",A Day in the Life,2005
Bill Holman,"Flamingo, like a flame in the sky
Flying over the island
To my lover nearby

Flamingo, with your tropical hue
For it's you I rely on
And the love that is true

The wind sings a song to you as you go
The song that I hear below
The murmuring heart

Flamingo, when the sun meets the sea
Say farewell to my lover
And hasten to me

Aah-ooh, aah-ooh, ooh-ooh
Flamingo

Flamingo, when the sun meets the sea

And hasten to me

Aah-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-aah",Flamingo,2006
Bill Holman,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you
",I'm Getting Sentimental Over You,2006
Bill Holman,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me",Lover Come Back to Me,2006
Bill Holman,"I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something I never had
Never had no kissin'
Oh, what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

The night is cold and I'm so alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet
Little things in my ear
Hugging and a-kissing
Oh, what I've been missing
Lover man, oh, where can you be?",Lover Man,2006
Bill Holman,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2008
Bill Holman & His Orchestra,"Im looking out the window
Im waitin at the door
To see if youll be coming by
The way you did before
The way you did before

You told me you were taken
But now you've set me free
And I believed you when you said
Your only love was me
Your only love was me

I bought a silk to please you
I wear it every day
I wear it just a in case you'll call
I wore it yesterday
I wore it yesterday

I hear them talk about you
They say youre like the rest
They say youll never break away
And Im just second best

Bill Holman Band,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,2007
Bill Horwitz,"You tell me that you're leavin', 
I can't believe it's true!
Girl, there's just no livin' without you.
Don't take your love away from me.
Don't you leave my heart in misery.
'Cause if you go, then I'll be blue,
Breakin' up is hard to do.

Remember when you held me tight,
And you kissed me all through the night.
Think of all that we been through,
And breakin' up is hard to do.

They say that breakin' up is hard to do,
Now I know, I know that it's true.
Don't say that this is the end.
Instead of breakin' up I wish that 
We were makin' up again.

I beg of you don't say goodbye,
Can't we give our love just one more try?
Come on baby, let's start anew, 
Breakin' up is hard to do.",Breakin' Up Is Hard to Do,1993
Bill Howland,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Bill Howland,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above

That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven

Bill Howland,"In A Sentimental Mood 
I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet

Bill Howland,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,2008
Bill Hughs,"Seize upon that moment long ago
One breath away and there you will be
So young and carefree
Again you will see
That place in time...so gold
Steal away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather
Nothing can ever...and be in time
Stay gold
But can it be
When we can see
So vividly
A memory
And yes you say
So must the day
Too, fade away
And leave a ray of sun
So gold
Life is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
though not imagined
All things that happen
Will age too old
Though gold",Stay Gold,1983
Bill Huntington,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever I will understand
Believe me, believe me I can't help but love you
But believe me I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just a memory

Bill Hutton,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Like a cigarette burn to the fleshy turbines of my heart
That faded afternoon floats breezily into my memory
Cool shafts of light appear and I'm left here
Standing naked on my own
Your voice is small on my voice mail system
A million miles away
But if I turned it off
I would not hear the little things you say
The world must chill
And like a king I ring up old acquaintances
It's like the man says I ain't here on business
It's all work anyway
On any other day
They say the light has got no equal
On any other day
The date's irrelevant but she was drunk
In the heat of the June night
The faces in the windows - shouts rang out
Into dawn's early light
The flailing arms and scrambling eggs I fled
On my two shambling legs
I gotta go I said - they both looked dead
On any other day
On any other day
They say the light has got no equal
On any other day
On any other day
On any other day
They say the light has got no equal
On any other day
The fire blazed away
The kitchen porch was all that remained
And I'm out here alone - beat up and pissed
Until this very day
That old hotel rang back in fuzzy time
And I was ravaged to the bone
Your voice got smaller 'til I realized
It was gone
On any other day
They'd say the light has got no equal
On any other day

Bill Johnson,"In questo girotondo d'anime
Chi si volta è perso e resta qua
Io so per certo amico
Mi son voltato anch'io

E per raggiungerti ho dovuto correre
Ma più mi guardo in giro e vedo che
See'è un mondo che va avanti anche se
Se tu non ci sei più, se tu non ci sei più

E dimmi perché
In questo girotondo d' anime
Non see'è un posto
Per scrollarsi via di dosso

Quello che ci è stato detto
E quello che ormai si sa
E allora sai che see'è

see'è che see'è, see'è che prendo un treno
Che va a paradiso città
E vi saluto a tutti e salto su
Prendo il treno e non ci penso più

Un viaggio a senso solo senza ritorno
Se non in volo
Senza fermate nè confini
Solo orizzonti neanche troppo lontani

Io mi prenderò il mio posto
E tu seduta lì al mio fianco
Mi dirai destinazione paradiso
Paradiso città

Bill Jones,"I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can

Time was turning rocks into sand.
Rocks into stone, stone into sand,
Sand that slips through the hands of a man 

So I built my castle close by the shore
And I slept on the sands of the ocean's roar.
Then I came to understand
That my house was built on shifting sand.

So we went to the hill and built us a town
With beautiful views for miles around.
When the mountain shook and tumbled down
We knew we built on shaky ground.

Before fish every walked on land, 
Time was turning rocks into sand.
Rocks into stone
Stone into sand
Sand that slips through the hands of a man 

Now the sands will shift and the earth's gonna roll.
The rocks and the rain will collect their toll.
And all I'll take is what I brought
And I may not get what I sought.

With her black leather and gold spike suspenders
And your chain, your black whip and pets.

Of the infamous Catherine the Great
And we know how you love the ovation
And the scene that it seems to create.

You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
For taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe

You laugh when I stumble and fall
There may come a say when I'll dance on your grave

Unable to dance I'll still crawl
Unable to dance I'll still crawl
Unable to dance I'll crawl.

I will walk alone by the black muddy river,

Roll muddy river, roll muddy river, black muddy river, roll.

And there's nothing left to do but count the years,
When the strings of my heart begin to sever,
And stones fall from my eyes instead of tears,

Don't be hanging around Old Catfish John
Come in the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the Sweet Delta Dawn""

Take me back to another morning
To a time so long ago
When the sweet Magnolia blossomed
Cotton fields as white as snow

Catfish John was a river hobo
Who lived and died by the river's bed
Looking back, I still remember
I was proud to be his friend

Mama said, ""Don't go near that river
Don't be hanging around Old Catfish John
Come in the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the Sweet Delta Dawn""

Born a slave in the town of Vicksburg
Traded for a chestnut mare
Lord, her never spoke in anger
Though his load was hard to bear

In London he did dwell
He had a lovely daughter
The truth to you I'll tell
Oh, truth to you I'll tell

She had sweethearts a-plenty
And men of high degree
There was none but Jack the sailor
Her true love e're would be
Oh, her true love e're could be

Now Jackie's gone a-sailing
With trouble on his mind
To leave his native country
And his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind

She went into a tailor shop
And dressed in men's array
And stepped on board a vessel
To convey herself away
Oh, convey herself away

Well before you step on board, sir
Your name I'd like to know
She smiled all in her countenance
They call me Jackaroe
Oh, they call me Jackaroe

Your waist is light and slender
Your fingers are neat and small
And your cheeks too red and rosy
To face the cannonball
Oh, to face the cannon-ball

Well, I know my waist is slender
My fingers are neat and small
But it would not make me tremble
To see ten thousand fall
Oh, to see ten thousand fall

The war soon being over
She hunted all around
And among the dead and dying
Her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found

She picked him up all in her arms
And carried him to the town
And sent for a physician who
Quickly healed his wounds
Oh, who quickly healed his wounds

This couple they got married
So well did they agree
This couple they got married
So why not you and me?
Oh, so why not you and me?

Just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity
Paint it with a skin of sky
Brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me
A peaceful place or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race
Full of hope, full of grace, is the human face
But afraid, we may lay our home to waste

There's a fear down here we can't forget
Hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around

Ashes to ashes all fall down

Now watch as the ball revolves and the nighttime falls
And again the hunt begins and again the blood wind calls
By and by again, the morning sun will rise
But the darkness never goes from some men's eyes

It strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Staking turf, dividing up meat
Nightmare spook, piece of heat
It's you and me, you and me

Click, flash blade in ghetto night
Rudie's looking for a fight
Rat cat alley roll them bones
Need that cash to feed that jones
And the politician's throwing stones
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes all fall down

Any way they fall guess who gets to pay the price
Money green or proletarian gray
Selling guns instead of food today

Singing ""black goes south and white comes north""
And the whole world full of petty wars
Singing ""I got mine and you got yours""
And the current fashions set the pace
Lose your step, fall out of grace
And the radical he rant and rage
Singing ""someone got to turn the page""
And the rich man in his summer home,
Singing ""Just leave well enough alone""
But his pants are down, his cover's blown

And the politicians throwing stones
So the kids they dance they shake their bones

Said tell me where your strength lies, if you please

Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand were dead

And Samson he walked up on the lion's back

Bill Lloyd,"Words are flowing out like 
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which 
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a 
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears 
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

There's just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents

I just want you for my own

Hear those magic reindeer click

So brightly everywhere

Won't you please bring my baby to me

At their tables and their chairs
Set to salvage certain numbers
From the wonder of the Tundra

Counting needles in their rooms
On the carpet in the corner
In a kind of secret slumber
While the in formation rain
Slashed the dirty windowpane to the square

Smoky broads and smoky windows in the square
Come come charmer come on over for the day
Disappearing cocoa forests flash and die
Fortunes crumble all demolished in the bay

In the perfect pointed steeple
Looked to see the lucky number

Bill McAdoo,"John Henry was about three days old,
Sittin' on his papa's knee.
He picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel;
Said, ""Hammer's gonna be the death of me, Lord, Lord.
Hammer's gonna be the death of me.""
The captain said to John Henry
""Gonna bring that steam drill 'round.
Gonna bring that steam drill out on the job.
Gonna whop that steel on down. Down,
Down.
Whop that steel on down.""
John Henry told his captain,
""A man ain't nothin' but a man,
But before I let your steam drill beat me
Down,
I'd die with a hammer in my hand. Lord,
Lord.
I'd dies with a hammer in my hand.""
John Henry said to his shaker,
""Shaker, why don't you sing?
I'm throwin' thirty pounds from my hips on
Down.
Just listen to that cold steel ring. Lord, Lord.
Listen to that cold steel ring.""
The man that invented the stream drill
Thought he was mighty fine,
But John Henry made fifteen feet;
The steam drill only made nine. Lord, Lord.
The steam drill only made nine.
John Henry hammered in the mountain
His hammer was striking fire.
But he worked so hard, he broke his poor
Heart.
He laid down his hammer and he died. Lord,
Lord.
He laid down his hammer and he died.
John Henry had a little woman.
Her name was Polly Ann.
John Henry took sick and went to his bed.
Polly Ann drove steel like a man. Lord,
Lord.
Polly Ann drove steel like a man.
John Henry had a little baby.
You could hold him in the palm of your
Hand.
The last words I heard that poor boy say,
""My daddy was steel-driving man. Lord,
Lord.
My daddy was a steel-driving.""

Bill Medley,"You watched your hand hold the pen
And write the note, but it wasn't you
And every single word was wrong
But every word you wrote you knew was true

And as you stepped into the night
You wondered how this ever got so damned confused
And again you cry in the darkness all alone
The bitter taste of the California goodbye

You watch the desert fall away to mountains
And to forest green and rivers blue
An you glance down at your watch and wonder
What he's thinking now that it's already noon

And then you think you'll chance the radio again
Though the last time every song just made you cry
Wo, wo, yes, it did
And as you touch the dial
Another tear falls for the California goodbye

There are dreams that we can keep
And there are stars that shine through space
Though it's cold and deep, dreams that we can keep
Oceans rise and fall and desert winds don't sleep

Tomorrow you'll be home again
A thousand memories down the road from yesterday
And if you're not too late
You might see, baby, brother pack his things and walk away

But somewhere deep inside
You know an aching heart can never run and hide
Ah, then you, you wanna die
As the sun sets fire to the desert sky
A curtain falls on the California goodbye, goodbye

He got it back in high school, when we were working on the farm
He's still got that arrowhead we found when we were kids
And I knew we would be like brothers, well just as long as we both lived
I still got my memories of the night we jumped the fence
Stole you uncle's pickup truck, drove it up around the bend
You were the handsome cowboy, I the trusty brave
We were looking for some fallen angel waiting to be saved
Well for some it just comes so easy
For others seems its bread in the bones
But we danced to the beat of a different drum
Then the one we heard at home
I went to the mountains, I was reaching for the sun
I was on fire for leaving, this angry battle I thought I'd won
David dug his trenches, he fought his war at home
My mountain soon was crumbling, God I was all alone
Well for some it just comes so easy
And for others its bread in their bones
But I danced to the beat of a different drum
Then the one I heard at home
It was years before the smoke cleared, I could come back home again
Look my father in the eyes, I could finally let him in
For he was not the enemy, no the enemy was within
And I knew the day they understood because David was my friend
Well for some you know it comes so easy
And for others seems its bread in their bones

I will always dance to the beat of a different drum

Bill Miller,"Clyde woke up real early while Edna was still asleep
Got dressed and had some coffee, then found his set of keys
He pulled on his levi jacket, he headed for the door
The kitchen smelled like dinner from the night before

A rumbling exhaust pipe woke Edna from her sleep
She stumbled like a drunkard yelling Clyde you wait for me
But Clyde was going nowhere, just sitting in his truck
Staring with a poker face, like he'd run out of luck

CHORUS:
Cause any fool would've turned and run
Any fool would've walked away
Any fool would've given up
But an ordinary man, he chose to stay

Now Edna, she couldn't say too much, she'd seen that look before
She kept tapping on Clyde's window, till he opened up the door
Then she put her arms around him, she never said a word
And Clyde turned on the radio and neither of them heard

He said Edna why don't you hop in, I think I'll call in sick
There's three one ways to a dead end street, now you just take your pick
And she pointed to the ballfield and the park where they first kissed
And Clyde grinned like he found something that he had almost missed

CHORUS

They spent that day in freedom, they hung on for many more
Raised up quite a family, they found what love was for
And the aging never slowed them down, they leaned on faith, not luck
Still out taking Sunday drives in Clyde's old beat up truck

You know Edna, she ain't no movie star and Clyde's a little slow
The shopping mall's replaced the park where they both used to go
But that's why they've both got each other, so they can keep their dreams alive
The simple dreams, the common man, still stand the test of time

CHORUS

He was pointing to the promised land
That lay beyond the reservation road
He said don't make promises that you won't keep
Don't betray the earth beneath your feet
As we walked on the reservation road

[Chorus:]
And just for that one moment we were racing with the wind
And sound of horses thundering they echoed once again
Back to a place where our hearts and souls belong
A thousand dreams away from that reservation road
A thousand dreams away from that reservation road
Then his spirit soared into the sky
Beyond the place where eagle fly
And my tears fell on the reservation road
Now a hundred moons have come and gone
And I'm holding on to my newborn son
One day he'll walk on the reservation road

Bill Miller,"Far across the Mississippi and out on the open plains
In an Oklahoma cow town where the sky begins to rain
In a dusty run-down honky tonk sits a drifting tumbleweed
Thumbing through some magazine that he can't even read

Now tumbleweed remembers how the west was won and lost
The homestead act and the dust bowl, everybody paid the cost
And the great white father promised to treat his children all the same
Back when Indian territory was Oklahoma's name

Oh tumbleweed keep rollin', he just roams from town to town
It ain't easy for a half-breed kid to try and settle down
Tumbleweed keep rollin', he can't find no place to rest
Yeah the desert wind blows tumbleweed like some spirit of the west

Well his boot heals tap in time to an old flat top guitar
And he's a guitar local hero and he sings straight from the heart
And his tip jar just a jungle of worn old dollar bills
He makes his rent and grocery in the local bar and grill

When he starts to picking that old guitar you know the people turn and stare
When he starts to sing the songs he wrote wells there's magic in the air
'Cause his song can heal your wounded heart, he can set you spirit free
He can raise you hopes to be the very best that you can be

Oh tumbleweed keep rollin', he just roams from town to town
It ain't easy for a half-breed kid to try and settle down
Tumbleweed keep rollin', he can't find no place to rest
Yeah the desert wind blows tumbleweed like some spirit of the west

So if you cross the Mississippi, you head out on the open plain
And you pass through Oklahoma and the sky begins to rain
And you feeling kind of rootless, you can't find no place to rest
Just remember tumbleweed, he's the spirit of the west

Oh the desert blows old tumbleweed like some spirit of the west",Tumbleweed,

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
No, oh no not me
I did it my way

A child with faith, faith will fly
Anita hasn't walked right since she was small
Her legs are short and twisted not straight and tall
She learned when she was young how to deal with the rejection
Cast into a world with all it standards of perfection
Most people looked away with a downward glance
And as a beautiful young woman, she was never asked to dance
Her dreams were just as lofty as the girl next door
And she remember what her father said when she couldn't take no more
He said
Someday your going to soar like a eagle,
You will run and never grow tired
You'll become a new creation
If you just keep the faith of a child,

In a one room apartment at sixth and brown
She's got a steady job well its all right for now
She has plans for moving on if she can make it some how
Her brown hands are folded as she bows her head to pray
Over doughnuts and some coffee she made up yesterday
Her mind begins to travel, she gives thanks to the lord
And a angel stands beside her, points out to the door
And said
Today you going to soar like a eagle
You will run and never grow tired
You've become a new creation
For you have kept the faith of a child
Kept the faith of a child, kept the faith of a child

and went out to find where he was singing. He had to
walk quite a ways through a big field, because the
song of the whippoorwill carried so well in the wind he
sound much closer then he really was. And on the way
the boy found a well worn trail, so he stayed on it for a
while. And sitting in the middle of the trail was coyote,
and coyote was singing too. He turned and saw the
boy and he said ""Why are you follow me?"" The boy
was frightened and said ""Well the trail you made
happened to be a short and easy way through this
field. Then coyote asked ""Well if your not following
me then why are you here?"" ""Well I heard the beautiful
song of the whippoorwill and wanted to watch him
sing."" ""Well do you not think my songs are beautiful?"",
said coyote. ""Oh"", said the boy, ""there good but I hear
you all the time. I much prefer the songs of the
whippoorwill"" This made coyote furious and he was
jealous of the whippoorwill's song. He said ""Listen to
my night song you might like this one"" And he pulled
back his head and yodeled out a tune. The boy
covered his ears and politely said, ""Thank you for the
song, but I must be going now."" ""Well"", coyote said, ""I
can show you a short cut to the whippoorwill boy, and
where he sings is just over there."" Pointing his claw,
smiling out of the side of his mouth. The boy paused,
looked around, he knew the night was passing fast so
he agreed to follow coyote. But coyote's trail was
rough and rocky. And the boy fell in quite a few
gopher holes along the way. Coyote turned around
and laughed and he yelled to the boy. ""Were almost
there, hurry up."" Coyote was at a full trot but the boy
had just fallen again and hurt his knee. And by the time
he got to the place where the whippoorwill had been
singing all night, it was morning. Whippoorwill was
gone. And so was coyote, in fact he could hear
coyote's songs in another field. So the boy turned and
headed for home, covered with burrs, misq bites and a
skinned up knee. And it was many summers later
when the boy became a wiser man. And he realized,
there are no shortcuts to find something you really
love. But there are many trails in this life. So you must
stay true to your path, and always keep and eye out

In an Oklahoma cow town where the sky begins to rain
In a dusty run-down honky tonk sits a drifting tumbleweed
Thumbing through some magazine that he can't even read

Now tumbleweed remembers how the west was won and lost
The homestead act and the dust bowl, everybody paid the cost
And the great white father promised to treat his children all the same
Back when Indian territory was Oklahoma's name

Oh tumbleweed keep rollin', he just roams from town to town
It ain't easy for a half-breed kid to try and settle down
Tumbleweed keep rollin', he can't find no place to rest
Yeah the desert wind blows tumbleweed like some spirit of the west

Well his boot heals tap in time to an old flat top guitar
And he's a guitar local hero and he sings straight from the heart
And his tip jar just a jungle of worn old dollar bills
He makes his rent and grocery in the local bar and grill

When he starts to picking that old guitar you know the people turn and stare
When he starts to sing the songs he wrote wells there's magic in the air
'Cause his song can heal your wounded heart, he can set you spirit free
He can raise you hopes to be the very best that you can be

Oh tumbleweed keep rollin', he just roams from town to town
It ain't easy for a half-breed kid to try and settle down

Too many in the darkness and they have no eyes to see
In the middle of the night they are taken from their homes
And they dig a common grave to cover up their flesh and bones
But a new day in dawning for the beggars and the blind
For those who have suffered and were always left behind
But the chains will be broken and the fences will come down
And we will walk as brothers once again on the sacred ground
Somewhere a brave heart must survive
Yes someday the truth will bury the lie
Yah somewhere a brave heart must survive

Bill Miller,"The skies are blue, but I still hear thunder
The skies are clear, but there's lightning under my skin
It's gonna rain again, and when the rains come down
I'll be on that road again
Warriors will ride.
On their painted horses
Blessed by the wind
And the unseen forces above
They will ride on as one
They will brave the storm
Till the rains are over and done
Ride on crazy horse
Take me to the hills
Beyond the battle, where the waters are still
Where it's so quiet you can hear the children run
Far away from the sound of the gun
These are the feathers of a golded eagle
These are the feathers of an ancient people
You must, you must set my people free
Never hold me down, for the eagle must fly free

They will ride on as one
They will brave the storm

These evil ways they will not last 

Someday their souls will be set free 
And their voices will be heard

And all the crops that ever died

Every fist you threw my way

This is a time for healing, the scars upon the land
My son, listen to me..
If I gave you a blanket, you could be warm
If I gave you a roof to stay under
Would that save you from the storm
Gave you all the money you could ever spend
Do you think that means your troubles would finally end

Cloaked in the darkness like a thief in the night
I have watched the farmer planting in his field
And known that what he sows, is there for me to steal
I take what I need, never more, never more
In the art of survival, there's no rich there's no poor
Time passes by, kingdoms come and go
I've seen it all, I'm a raven in the snow
I have watched the seekers searching for their gold
The rape of the land, generations unfold
Nations of the world, their rise and their fall
I've watched it all, I'm a raven in the snow
I have heard the crying, wailing in the wind
Empty words and broken promises, time and time again
Song of the sparrow, call of the crow
Echo in the mountain and the valley's below
The scarecrow and the hunter, can't keep me away
The winter winds a blowin' couldn't lead me astray
You can separate the flock still my colors would show
I will stand out, like a raven in the snow",Raven in the Snow,1995

Like a brush from my past they painted the evening sky
But the currents so strong, I couldn't hold on
They kept rollin' by
And all the colors bled into a river of time

The innocent child fades into the mist on the river of time
An angry young man is shaking his fist on the river of time
Roll on river of time, rage on river of time

There are faces and places I hold sacred
Some I've passed along the way
Some live on in memory, some I've passed along the way
With the rain from a storm, a river is born
Winding down to the sea, and the river of time
Keeps on rollin' thru eternity

The angry young man learns how to forgive
On the river of time
He holds an innocent child in his arms

Talkin' suicide with an old friend of mine
They gathered a crowd down at the end of the tracks

They came down hard on the weak
Causing war and starvation
Refusing to let them speak

They got their trophies and their cars
Big houses on the hill and they don't really care
That their wars are a killin' me

With ten thousand angels fly
No one will force them to run

Blood on his hands and it won't come clean

The fires of rage begin to burn
You can't go home and he can't go on
His flesh is weak and his spirits gone

Now he's behind a prison wall
He doesn't have the will to live
He says it's all his father's fault
He taught his son the way to live
He was unable to forgive

She wore his ring for thirty years
And one night he confessed his darkest fears
He'd been unfaithful, he'd been untrue
What could she say, what could she do?

No where to run, no where to turn
The fires of rage begin to burn
She can't go home and she can't go on

I still got my memories of the night we jumped the fence
Stole you uncle's pickup truck, drove it up around the bend
You were the handsome cowboy, I the trusty brave
We were looking for some fallen angel waiting to be saved

For others seems its bread in the bones
But we danced to the beat of a different drum

David dug his trenches, he fought his war at home

And for others its bread in their bones
But I danced to the beat of a different drum
Then the one I heard at home
It was years before the smoke cleared, I could come back home again
Look my father in the eyes, I could finally let him in
For he was not the enemy, no the enemy was within
And I knew the day they understood because David was my friend
Well for some you know it comes so easy

Bill Miller,"Clyde woke up real early while Edna was still asleep
Got dressed and had some coffee, then found his set of keys
He pulled on his levi jacket, he headed for the door
The kitchen smelled like dinner from the night before

A rumbling exhaust pipe woke Edna from her sleep
She stumbled like a drunkard yelling Clyde you wait for me
But Clyde was going nowhere, just sitting in his truck
Staring with a poker face, like he'd run out of luck

CHORUS:
Cause any fool would've turned and run
Any fool would've walked away
Any fool would've given up
But an ordinary man, he chose to stay

Now Edna, she couldn't say too much, she'd seen that look before
She kept tapping on Clyde's window, till he opened up the door
Then she put her arms around him, she never said a word
And Clyde turned on the radio and neither of them heard

He said Edna why don't you hop in, I think I'll call in sick
There's three one ways to a dead end street, now you just take your pick
And she pointed to the ballfield and the park where they first kissed
And Clyde grinned like he found something that he had almost missed

CHORUS

They spent that day in freedom, they hung on for many more
Raised up quite a family, they found what love was for
And the aging never slowed them down, they leaned on faith, not luck
Still out taking Sunday drives in Clyde's old beat up truck

You know Edna, she ain't no movie star and Clyde's a little slow
The shopping mall's replaced the park where they both used to go
But that's why they've both got each other, so they can keep their dreams alive
The simple dreams, the common man, still stand the test of time

He'll walk the footsteps of a man for the first time
While he's holding back the boys tears

Hungry and cold, so young and so old
There's so much that he doesn't know
But the voice that's inside him
Keeps telling him mile after mile

You're learning the art of survival
He eyes the lights of an ageless horizon,
Rising up from the sand
He aches for something to believe in and guide him

Out across this no man's land
Bridges behind him are burning to ashes
There's no way that he can turn back

He's sleeping in a cardboard tent too drunk to know its through
But the rainbow from this morning sun can't be too far behind
Down his alley where the sun won't shine the blind must lead the blind

Ten stories up the boy looks out his face pressed to the screen
He heard the thunder rolling in it woke him from his dream
And his mother's calling out to him boy get up and make your bed
But that kid's a thousand miles away hasn't heard a word she said

But as long as the grass will grow
In the cracks of the sidewalk
Next to the old lampposts
As long as the birds will fly
In the thick broken air against a highrise sky
Then the morning sun will shed it's light

Inside a cab, the driver yawns, he's worked an all night shift
He sets his meter one last time before he call it quits
The heartbeat of the homeless still echoes in the streets
They're all wrapped in coats and blankets don't have enough to eat

Let it shine when others make it rain
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

Like the moon and stars that guide you out across the sweeping plain
Keep your eye on the horizon when you cross that great divide
All you have is what's inside you when you take that lonesome ride
Forever ride, forever ride, forever ride?
So go to sleep now little brother, dream of red tails in the west
I know until you find your way there, your crazy soul will never rest

I could fall all over and over again

And saw above me that endless skyway,

To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts,
And all around me , a voice was sounding:

A sign was painted said: Private Property,
But on the back side it didn't say nothing

Bill Miller,"I saw Judas Iscariot with a bottle of wine
Talkin' suicide with an old friend of mine
They gathered a crowd down at the end of the tracks
And a woman cried out, ""When is God comin' back?""

And they pretended not to notice
They came down hard on the weak
Causing war and starvation
Refusing to let them speak

For every mountain I climb
For every river that winds
For every wind that will blow
I will send out my prayers
To the children below

I saw a crazy horse walkin' alone in the dark
On the streets paved in blood, on his broken heart
He never dreamed it would turn out like this

They pretend that they just don't see
They are blinded with their own mediocrity
They got their trophies and their cars
Big houses on the hill and they don't really care
That their wars are a killin' me

For every child that follows the dream
With ten thousand angels fly
No one will force them to run
They will stand up and fight till this battle is won

For every river that winds
For every wind that will blow

A shiny gun in a young thief's hand
A stolen car and a broken dream
Blood on his hands and it won't come clean

No where to run, no where to turn
The fires of rage begin to burn
You can't go home and he can't go on
His flesh is weak and his spirits gone

Now he's behind a prison wall
He doesn't have the will to live
He says it's all his father's fault
He taught his son the way to live
He was unable to forgive

She wore his ring for thirty years
And one night he confessed his darkest fears
He'd been unfaithful, he'd been untrue
What could she say, what could she do?

No where to run, no where to turn
The fires of rage begin to burn
She can't go home and she can't go on

Killed her desires, her will to live
And who was blinded, what did they miss?
Will she be able to forgive? Are we able to forgive?

He got it back in high school, when we were working on the farm
He's still got that arrowhead we found when we were kids
And I knew we would be like brothers, well just as long as we both lived
I still got my memories of the night we jumped the fence
Stole you uncle's pickup truck, drove it up around the bend
You were the handsome cowboy, I the trusty brave
We were looking for some fallen angel waiting to be saved
Well for some it just comes so easy
For others seems its bread in the bones
But we danced to the beat of a different drum
Then the one we heard at home
I went to the mountains, I was reaching for the sun
I was on fire for leaving, this angry battle I thought I'd won
David dug his trenches, he fought his war at home
My mountain soon was crumbling, God I was all alone
Well for some it just comes so easy
And for others its bread in their bones
But I danced to the beat of a different drum
Then the one I heard at home
It was years before the smoke cleared, I could come back home again
Look my father in the eyes, I could finally let him in
For he was not the enemy, no the enemy was within
And I knew the day they understood because David was my friend
Well for some you know it comes so easy
And for others seems its bread in their bones

Bill Miller,"Clyde woke up real early while Edna was still asleep
Got dressed and had some coffee, then found his set of keys
He pulled on his levi jacket, he headed for the door
The kitchen smelled like dinner from the night before

A rumbling exhaust pipe woke Edna from her sleep
She stumbled like a drunkard yelling Clyde you wait for me
But Clyde was going nowhere, just sitting in his truck
Staring with a poker face, like he'd run out of luck

CHORUS:
Cause any fool would've turned and run
Any fool would've walked away
Any fool would've given up
But an ordinary man, he chose to stay

Now Edna, she couldn't say too much, she'd seen that look before
She kept tapping on Clyde's window, till he opened up the door
Then she put her arms around him, she never said a word
And Clyde turned on the radio and neither of them heard

He said Edna why don't you hop in, I think I'll call in sick
There's three one ways to a dead end street, now you just take your pick
And she pointed to the ballfield and the park where they first kissed
And Clyde grinned like he found something that he had almost missed

CHORUS

They spent that day in freedom, they hung on for many more
Raised up quite a family, they found what love was for
And the aging never slowed them down, they leaned on faith, not luck
Still out taking Sunday drives in Clyde's old beat up truck

You know Edna, she ain't no movie star and Clyde's a little slow
The shopping mall's replaced the park where they both used to go
But that's why they've both got each other, so they can keep their dreams alive
The simple dreams, the common man, still stand the test of time

In an Oklahoma cow town where the sky begins to rain
In a dusty run-down honky tonk sits a drifting tumbleweed
Thumbing through some magazine that he can't even read

Now tumbleweed remembers how the west was won and lost
The homestead act and the dust bowl, everybody paid the cost
And the great white father promised to treat his children all the same
Back when Indian territory was Oklahoma's name

Oh tumbleweed keep rollin', he just roams from town to town
It ain't easy for a half-breed kid to try and settle down
Tumbleweed keep rollin', he can't find no place to rest
Yeah the desert wind blows tumbleweed like some spirit of the west

Well his boot heals tap in time to an old flat top guitar
And he's a guitar local hero and he sings straight from the heart
And his tip jar just a jungle of worn old dollar bills
He makes his rent and grocery in the local bar and grill

When he starts to picking that old guitar you know the people turn and stare
When he starts to sing the songs he wrote wells there's magic in the air
'Cause his song can heal your wounded heart, he can set you spirit free
He can raise you hopes to be the very best that you can be

Oh tumbleweed keep rollin', he just roams from town to town
It ain't easy for a half-breed kid to try and settle down
Tumbleweed keep rollin', he can't find no place to rest
Yeah the desert wind blows tumbleweed like some spirit of the west

So if you cross the Mississippi, you head out on the open plain
And you pass through Oklahoma and the sky begins to rain
And you feeling kind of rootless, you can't find no place to rest

He'll walk the footsteps of a man for the first time
While he's holding back the boys tears

Hungry and cold, so young and so old
There's so much that he doesn't know
But the voice that's inside him
Keeps telling him mile after mile

He eyes the lights of an ageless horizon,
Rising up from the sand

Out across this no man's land

He's sleeping in a cardboard tent too drunk to know its through
But the rainbow from this morning sun can't be too far behind
Down his alley where the sun won't shine the blind must lead the blind

Ten stories up the boy looks out his face pressed to the screen
He heard the thunder rolling in it woke him from his dream
And his mother's calling out to him boy get up and make your bed
But that kid's a thousand miles away hasn't heard a word she said

CHORUS:
But as long as the grass will grow
In the cracks of the sidewalk
Next to the old lampposts
As long as the birds will fly
In the thick broken air against a highrise sky
Then the morning sun will shed it's light
On the city down below

Inside a cab, the driver yawns, he's worked an all night shift
He sets his meter one last time before he call it quits
The heartbeat of the homeless still echoes in the streets
They're all wrapped in coats and blankets don't have enough to eat

Like the moon and stars that guide you out across the sweeping plain

Forever ride, forever ride, forever ride?
So go to sleep now little brother, dream of red tails in the west

So you will know that I want you

And the beautiful stars are a'gleam

Till we meet in Heaven it seems
But I hold you close to my heart love

You promised that you would wait for me that nothin' could come between
That in my arms someday you'd be my wife and lovely Queen
I built you that cozy home and made a garden there
And planted too with my own hands sweet flowers rich and fair

My future hopes are placed in you you've been my guidin' star
Please write and tell me that you're true to the sailor who waits afar
Just tell me that you love me yet still long to be my wife
I'll return and then we'll wed and live a happy life

Down by the Church of God
I looked upon the one I love

Now there's a crepe upon her door

The angels took my darling
God needed the one I loved
I reached the old Kentucky shore today
I'll make my plans and meet her up above

Was tell the one I love goodbye
I would like to see him before I go
But I'll meet him in the sky

He has all the wealth and charm and not my kind of brand
Baby I fell down on my knees a pleading for your love
Can't understand what I saw in a sugar coated love

Said I was your Romeo and you my Juliet
I thought you were my angel, my little sugar dove

Well, I wish I could be like a bird in the sky
How sweet it would be if I found I could fly
Oh, I'd soar to the sun and look down at the sea
And I'd sing 'cause I'd know that, and I'd sing 'cause I'd know that

And I stand right there to say
My grip is packed to travel
And I'm scratching gravel
For that blue ridge far away

I'm gonna stay right by my Ma
I'm gonna do right by my Pa
Lay around the cabin door
No work on worry anymore
I've got those blue ridge mountain blues
What to see my old day tray
What to hunt the possum
Where the corn top blossom
On that blue ridge far away

I see a window with the light
I see two heads of snowy white
It seems I can hear them both recite
Where is my wondering boy tonight
I'm got those blue ridge mountain blues
And I stand right here to say
Every day I'm counting
Still I climb that mountain
Oh, that blue ridge far away",Blue Ridge Mountain Blues,1991
Bill Monroe,"Every word on my mind
Bonny is your good-bye
Black, black, black, black is the day
No sun is shining in my world
Bonny, since you went away

Sad, sad, sad, sad in my heart
All my laughter's turned to tears
Bonny, since you've been apart

Every pretty flower has
Turned to brown
They all look like me
With their head tied down
My heart only sing the sadness song
Bonny, since you've been gone

Cry, cry, cry, you know I cry
Every word on my mind
Bonny is your good-bye
Every word on my mind
Bonny is you good-bye",Bonny,1991
Bill Monroe,"Love oh love careless love
Love oh love careless love
Love oh love oh careless love
See what careless love has done

Once I wore my apron low 
Once I wore my apron low
Once I wore my apron low
I couldn't keep you from my door

What oh what will mama say 
What oh what will mama say 
What oh what will mama say 
When she learns I've gone astray

I love my mama and papa too 
I love my mama and papa too 
I love my mama and papa too 
See what I get for lovin' you

Now I wear my apron high 
Now I wear my apron high 
Now I wear my apron high

Bill Monroe,"Don't go so far away love, try to settle down
For losing you would be more than I could bear
Tho' I'm tied to another, I hope someday she'll set me free
For I don't want a cheap love affair

I knew we loved each other the night that we first met
It just happened there was nothing we could do
Let me stay with my children til they can understand
That I love them and they'll know I love you too

[Chorus]
So darling please forgive me, don't give me all the blame
Tho' I know that it doesn't seem so fair
When I'm free I'll make you happy if you'll only wait for me
But I don't want a cheap love affair

[Chorus]",Cheap Love Affair,1991
Bill Monroe,"Come go with me to yonder valley
Where we once stood beneath the tree
Where we once planned our life together
I can't forget come go with me

Come let us live some moments over
Then maybe you won't want to leave
I love you then and will forever
I can't forget come go with me

I can't forget the flowers blooming
The rose that I pick for you
Time changed you but I'm not changing
I loved you then and I still do

Come go with me to yonder valley
Where on the largest of the trees
I'll carve your name to prove I love you
I can't forget come go with me

I love you then and I still do",Come Go with Me,1991
Bill Monroe,"When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them ol' cotton fields back home
It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them ol' cotton fields back home
When them cotton bolls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them ol' cotton fields back home
It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them ol' cotton fields back home",Cotton Fields,1991
Bill Monroe,"Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the roses are dying
It's you, It's you must go and I must bide

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
For I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so

But when ye come and all the flowers are a dying
And if I am dead, dead I well may be
Just come and find, find the place
Find the place where I lay lying
And kneel and say an ""Ave"" there for me

And I will hear tho soft you tread above me
And my grave, my grave warmer and sweeter be
For you're gonna kneel and you're gonna tell
God you're gonna tell me how you loved me
And I will sleep in peace until you come to me",Danny Boy,1991
Bill Monroe,"Out on the perilous deep
Where dangers silently creep
And storms so violently sweep
You're drifting to far from the shore

Drifting too far from the shore (from the shore)
Drifting too far from the shore (peaceful shore)
Come to Jesus today, let him show you the way
You're drifting to far from the shore

Today the tempest rolls high
And clouds overshadow the sky
Sure death is hovering nigh
You're drifting to far from the shore

Why meet a terrible fate
Mercy abundantly waits
Turn back before its to late
You're drifting to far from the shore



",Drifting Too Far from the Shore,1991
Bill Monroe,"Farther along we'll know more about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by

Tempted and tried will oft make you wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested though in the wrong

When death has found and taken our loved ones
Leaving our home so lonely and dreary
Then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after year",Farther Along,1991
Bill Monroe,"Those pretty wild flowers I love them so well
The flowers know secrets that I'll never tell
I go out to pick a bouquet of all
And bring them all in before the leaves start to fall

When the leaves start to fall and the flowers have died
If only little darling I could be by your side
Tho' it breaks my heart to hear your name
Soon the wild flowers will bloom again in the spring

I wish I could see her and talk of our love
And of all the pretty flowers sent here from above
Oh maybe I'll see her in Heaven someday
And pick pretty flowers as we go on our way

The memories of you dear I'll never erase
There'll never be another that can take your place
I'll still keep our secret with the flowers of love
And we'll pick them together in Heaven above",Flowers of Love,1991
Bill Monroe,"Your love is colder than a foggy river
Rollin on a heart of stone
You left me stranded on this foggy river
Cold and helpless and alone

I knew someday that you would turn me down
I got worries on my mind
Yes I'm doomed to sail this foggy river
Till I leave my love behind

There's no tomorrow on this foggy river
Only memories linger on
A mist of sorrows fills this foggy river
Everything I had is gone

I can't escape this broken heart of mine
I've no freedom anymore
Heaven help me on this foggy river
Till I reach that distant shore",Foggy River,1991
Bill Monroe,"I'm going home (I'm going home)
For my reward (for my reward)
Away up there (away up there)
To see my Lord (To see my lord)
He promised me (He promised me)
In the by and by (in the by and by)
A precious home (a precious home)
Up in the sky.

[Chorus]
I'm gonna live right (I'm gonna live right)
To see my Lord (to see my Lord)
And the other friends (and the other friends)
Who've gone before (who've gone before)

When we all get there (when we all get there)
With Mother and Dad (with Mother and Dad)
And the angels fair .

Be ready to go (be ready to go)
What the Lord has planned (what the Lord has planned)

And lose your soul (and lose your soul)
Hear the angels play (hear the angels play)
On the harps of gold.

[Chorus]",Going Home,1991
Bill Monroe,"The days are so lonely, the nights are so long
Our home is a prison since you are gone
And I'll always wonder why our love didn't last
With no hope for tomorrow, I'll live in the past

A door that won't knock, a phone that don't ring
The postman goes by and he don't leave a thing
A pain in my heart and tears in my eyes
My sweetheart has gone; I'm left here to cry

I'm the biggest pretender you ever could see
I pretend you still love me; false love couldn't be
And then I remember and I know that it's true
For you're with another, and I know I've lost you

I'll just go on dreaming sweet dreams of the past
Of when you still love me and I thought it would last
But life is so short, and time moves so fast
I'll never forget you as I live in the past",I Live in the Past,1991
Bill Monroe,"A policeman's whistle gayly, a smile upon his face
As he walked along the old familiar beat
He saw a little bay crying and thought his heart would break
Standing bare foot in the middle of the street

I was left on the street with no shoes upon my feet
When I saw my mom and daddy drive away
Now I'm not old enough to know every much myself
But I saw my dad and mommy drive away

The policeman stopped the traffic, then went up to the boy
And he asked him gently, where do you belong
The little boy stopped crying and with trembling lips he said
I'm not big enough to know just what went wrong

[Chorus:]
The little boy is happy now with a new mom and dad
His new daddy is the policeman on the beat
Tho' he can't forget that awful day it doesn't seem to hurt so bad
He has a brand new pair of shoes upon his feet

[Chorus]",I Was Left on the Street,1991
Bill Monroe,"I'm sad tonight my heart is weary
I'm wondering if I'm wrong or right
To dream about you though you left me
I wonder where you are tonight

[Chorus:]
That old rain is cold and slowly falling
Upon my window pane tonight
And though your love grows even colder
I wonder where you are tonight

 
Your heart was cold you never loved me
Although you often said you cared
And now you've gone to find another
Someone who knows the love I shared

[Chorus]
 
Then came the dawn the day you left me
I tried to smile with all my might
But I just couldn't hide the sorrow
That lingers in my heart tonight

[Chorus]",I Wonder Where You Are Tonight,1991
Bill Monroe,"On Sunday, when the church bells start ringin'
They're ringin' for you and for me
Let's all kneel down at the altar
And pray that our souls might be free.

CHORUS:
I'll meet you in church Sunday morning
And we'll all kneel down and pray
We'll pray to our Lord up in heaven
To guide us safe home on our way.

It's a place where we all meet on Sunday
To worship our Lord up above
And let all of our sins be forgiven
And meet with our loved ones above.

Repeat chorus

In heaven I hear a voice callin'
From the land where there's one endless day
Let's all be prepared to meet Jesus
The path is narrow to that home far away.

Repeat chorus




",I'll Meet You in Church Sunday Morning,1991
Bill Monroe,"Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide its face and cry

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die
That mean's he's lost his will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry",I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,1991
