Paul Wright,"The city lights shine so bright in the sky at night when the sun goes down
For the evening (down for the evening)
The palm trees sway with the breeze under these conditions 
I think I'm thanking God for the seasons

'cause he's all that I'm searching for that's right (that's right)
So give him your burdens and get your body on the dance floor (c'mon now!)

oh oh things are getting brighter and brighter and brighter and brighter and brighter
Oh oh my burdens getting lighter and lighter and lighter and lighter and lighter
Oh oh things are getting brighter and brighter and brighter and brighter and brighter
Oh oh my burdens getting lighter and lighter and lighter and lighter and lighter

before g.o.d. my burden was heavy I had no reason for living
But then he gave me eyes to see everything inside of me that held me back from this freedom

'cause he's all that I'm searching for that's right
So give him your burdens and get your body on the dance floor (c'mon now!)

oh things are getting brighter
Burdens getting lighter
Things are getting brighter

Paul Wright,"You are someone even if nobody knows you
You are not a no one (no one)
You are why I'm here basking in your tears
Don't you know that I love you
Where you go from here is up to you (up to you)
Which road will you choose
Listen don't abuse your freedom

crashing down I am here to help you
Crashing down yea I'll never leave or forsake you

I fall on my face in the sand
Why did I fall? Why couldn't I stand?
Under the pressure temptations rise
Your Word is a treasure your Son is life

For all the family dem livin out with problems
And all the people who need help and can't solve them
For all the ones who live out in misery
For all the prisoners

Kneelin down I'm spreadin my wings and then I'll fly
Yes indeed I'll keep my eyes up to the sky
Looking down so so high

Kneelin down spreadin my wings to the sky
Looking down and my spirit is alive
Keep my eyes on the most high
He lifts me up way up into the sky

Paul Wright,"Now here's a song all about the flows
All about the plastic that's in between my toes
All about the hip hop all about the flip-flops that I rock
And don't ya know they are locales
I got em in hawaii yea waikiki
But now I'm going back to cali
Drivin with my friends gonna surf in the ocean
From santa cruz all the way up to oregon
They got me laid back feelin that warm tap
Slappin to the bottom of my feet
And jamming on the beach yea rappin to the beat
I'm gonna take off my shirt and get myself a tan (what?)

So get up get up and get down (get down)
Get your flip flops off the ground
You gotta get your flip flops off the ground
And jump jump well everybody

Everything's gonna be alright
As were dancing in the sun light
(We're representing c'mon cmon)
From the west coast

Portland, oregon, seattle, washington
Chi-town, inglewood, new york, boston
West coast, east coast, pacific ocean
Stopped at the atlantic just to stick my toe in
Rode in airplanes, subways, taxis, ferries,
Trains all the way across the usa
From nashville to memphis, atlanta, st. louis
Ran a marathon and got first in the us
From texas to phoenix to cairo in egypt
The belly dancers danced as I ran with achievement
In sync with the flips of the flops that I rock
I stopped in miami and I said 'what?'

Everything's gonna be alright
From the west coast to the east coast
From LA all the way to new york city

Paul Wright,"She's got dreams dreams that he's got things
That'll open up her sky so she can use her wings
To fly away

she looks out her window
Watching people as they pass on by
Some of them want to come inside
Man oh man one on one I wonder which one will she trust
'Cause some men only lust
And she wants a man who can understand
What a woman wants and if he can appreciate her and not deface her
And she wants a king with a diamond ring
Not some prince charming who's gonna steal everything that he gave her
Yeah

She's got to fly away (uh 1-2, uh 1-2, uh 1-2)
I watch her walk next to you but soon
She's got to get away (oh that's true, oh that's true, oh that's true)
I hope her dreams do come true
'Cause she is a butterfly
Spreadin spreadin spreadin spreadin
Spreading her wings
(She's beautiful, she's beautiful, she's beautiful)

But her heart is a kingdom without a king
And without him she can't sing
So she waits on a watchtower
Hoping praying waiting for his arrival (and all the people in the world say) 
And then they'll

And she wants a family (family) she wants a lover (lover)
She wants a best friend closer than any other
A man that's true she wants a man who
Can hear god's voice and know what he is called to do
She wants a hard worker not some lazy bum
But a man who knows how to get the job done
She wants a family to be a mother and raise a child that came from her
Yeah

She's got dreams dreams that he's got things things
That'll open up her sky so she can use her wings
To (to to) fly away
She's got dreams dreams that he's got things things
That'll open up her sky so she can use her wings
To (to to) fly away

She's got to fly away (fly away)
She's got to find her way
She's got to fly away

She's on the ground learning to fly but she's flying now
She's on the ground it's time to fly she's gonna fly now
She's on the ground looking down it's time to fly ya'll
She's on the ground but watch her rise and fly away
She was looking down but now she's looking to the sky ya'll
Spreading her wings to give it a try give it a try give it a try
To fly away when the rest of the girls are on the fall ya'll
She's spreading her wings to fly away

'Cause she's got dreams dreams that he's got things things
That'll open up her sky so she can use her wings

Paul Wright,"Jim woke up on a wintry day
A beautiful red head stole his heart away
Forever never would his life be the same again
She had a heavenly heart a spiritual mind
Walking with Jesus all the time (all the time)
'I don't see a need to change,' he said 'I like the way I am'
She looked into his big blue eyes
And this is what she said to Jim

It's on you until you give god a try
It's on you don't let this world pass you by
Cause it's on you until you give God a try
It's on you well it's on you it's on

Ya can never ever ever ever do it on your own
When you do it all alone you will never make it home
Ya can never ever ever ever do it on your own
When you do it all alone you will never make it home
Ya can never ever ever ever do it on your own
When you do it all alone you will never make it home
Ya can never ever ever ever do it on your

Your life after you die
Life after death
What's gonna happen when you die'
Is there anything else'

Fast forward sixty years (sixty years)
Jim's time is drawing near
But he's not afraid to die (I'm not afraid to die)
He has a heavenly heart a spiritual mind
Talks with Jesus (talks with Jesus) all the time (all the time)
And he says, (listen to what he said)
'Oh heavenly father look at my daughter
And my son they gotta know the way
Dear god I pray and to them I say'

Never gonna die never gonna die never gonna die gonna live forever
Never gonna die never gonna die god gave us life gonna live forever
Never gonna die never gonna die never gonna die never gonna die die
Never gonna die never gonna die god gave us life gonna live forever

He's watching you/ life after death
He loves you/ what's gonna happen when you
He's watching you/ is there anything else
He loves you/ and he died
'Eyes closed I know you know I want'
For you
'Eyes closed last breath is there anything else?'
And he died
'Eyes closed I know I want so much more'
For you
'Eyes closed eyes closed last breath is there'

Life after death
It's all been done for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only 
Son that whoever believes in his name shall never die but have eternal life",Life After Death,2003

But I got my rhyme and I got my rap but I got my style that is so kick back it goes one it goes two.

Verse 1:

Back in the seventies life was heavely Jesus freaks in the streets singing melodies long haired hippies walking in birkenstocks became prophets rockin in coffee shops 30 years later the musics changed but the message is the same from the san francisco bay they made a move to the city of Eugene where the grass grows green if you know what I mean I received my dream back when I was a teen and at a show I saw a man rock a freestyle flow so I grabbed my guitar and taught myself introducing you all to folk-hop from the west.

As every fairy tale comes real

And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say I love you, right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
But something's lost and something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all

",Both Sides Now,1991
Paul Young,"If you feel the hurt is but a kiss away
Close your eyes and take it
And if you feel that pain can tear you in two
Go ahead and bear it

You know the words he's gonna say
Still you sit and listen
And those tender words can melt this strong man's heart
Yours will learn a lesson

And when you hear him say
""I don't want your love""
Try not to turn away

A broken man almost died of a broken heart
A broken man, that's what I am
And when you think you've had enough
Just say stop, I understand

You'll stop your tears from building up inside
Baby, stop your trembling hands

And when you hear him say
""I don't want your love""
Try not to turn away

A broken man almost died of a broken heart
A broken man, that's what I am
I'm a broken man

Dress the trees with angel hair

This is real, it's a fact.
I'll always belong only to you.
And each day I'll be living to 
Make sure I'm giving you more love and more joy 
than age or time could ever destroy.
Oh honey now, my love will be so sound, 
gonna take about a hundred lifetimes to live it down, 
wear it down, tear it down.
 
As we grow older, no need to fear,
'Cause when you need me I'll be here.
I'll be beside you every step of the way.
A heart that's truthful, and is keeping it youthful 
With more love and more joy than age or time could ever destroy.

I see reflections of you and me

No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

And left me all alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind

Reflects a hurt I can't control
Although you're gone
I keep holding on
To those happy times
Oh, girl when you were mine

As I peer through the windows
Of lost time
Keeping looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt baby
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects a hurt I can't control

In you I put
All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes

But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,

For I'm the kind of guy who is always on the roam,
Wherever I Lay My Hat That's My Home.

You had a romance, did you break it by chance over me?
If it's so I'd like for you to know that I'm not worth it, you see.
For I'm the type of guy who is always on the roam,
Wherever I Lay My Hat That's My Home,

You keep telling your friends that I'm your man.
What do I have to do to make you understand?
For I'm the kind of guy that gives girl the eye, everybody knows.
But I love them and I leave them, break their hearts and deceive them

Paul Young & the Q-Tips,"If you feel the hurt is but a kiss away
Close your eyes and take it
And if you feel that pain can tear you in two
Go ahead and bear it

You know the words he's gonna say
Still you sit and listen
And those tender words can melt this strong man's heart
Yours will learn a lesson

And when you hear him say
""I don't want your love""
Try not to turn away

A broken man almost died of a broken heart
A broken man, that's what I am
And when you think you've had enough
Just say stop, I understand

You'll stop your tears from building up inside
Baby, stop your trembling hands

And when you hear him say
""I don't want your love""
Try not to turn away

A broken man almost died of a broken heart
A broken man, that's what I am
I'm a broken man

Paul Young & the Q-Tips,"Sunshine blue skies please go away
The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes.
Oh, let it rain.
I'm a man and I got my pride
Til' it rains I'm gonna stay inside and let it rain.",I Wish It Would Rain,2000

Because I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place

If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute

She's just a substitute

Paul Zarzyski,"When the chute gate wings open, here we go again
The desperate dance, the kick and the spin
Dust risin' from a cross bred bull, fire meets with pride
The man's come a long way, just for the short ride

His wife's in the grandstands, tryin to swallow the fear
A little baby inside her, who's time's drawing near
The bulls flying high now, then he falls to his side
Their love came a long way, just for the short ride

Two hearts in the darkness, sing a blue lullaby

Beat the drum slowly, for a cowboy's last ride

And when the dust had all settled and the crowd disappeared
The sirens still echo, in an unborn childs ear
Little boys due in April, he has his daddy's blue eyes
He'll always remember, his father's last ride

They preached at the service, from john 25
How christ came along way, just for the short ride
Beat the drum slowly, for a cowboy's last ride
Well the chute gate swings open, here we go again",All This Way for the Short Ride,2005

Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore tree

While I'm alone and blue as can be

And everyday a nigga repping, and riding for Screw
I was keeping it in my chest, now I'm getting it out
I know you spectators in the game, better close your mouth
I got a lot of my time invested, up in this game
It's S.U.C. till I'm dead, ain't no need to explain
I'm in the Maab with guerillas, and we coming in packs
The only friends we got deep, and coming with black gats
So niggaz'd back back, I'm a man dude with a attitude
And I'm too quick to click, Lil' Trae is a damn fool
In my zone leave me alone, I ain't trying to be fucked with
Everything that I got, is everything that I want to roll with
Me and me and myself, you niggaz bad for my health
Now I'm pumped up like Superman, with a uppercut to be felt
I ain't playing with what I'm saying, you cats better start praying
For Deebo commits to spraying, and everybody be staying

Why, these fellas talking down
Don't they know, why we'll ride
And make somebody slide, beware

Don't they know, why we'll ride

My iced out cross, hanging down to my belly
Got your lil mama, butt naked shake her jelly
I'ma put her on a tape, and play it back on the telly
Boys hate to love the street show, when we showing up
I give me back the same middle finger, they be throwing up
They can't afford the pints, by the case that we po'ing up
Young in the game, it's time to start growing up
Get you some hustle, get you some grind
Show me some muscle, show me some shine
Fuck trying to crime, off another nigga name
It's just a matter of time, 'fore I run you out the game
Because I can't believe the nerve, of these hoes
Trying to use my nigga Pimp name, for benefit shows
Fin to start kicking in do's, with the macks
Trying to let that shit pass, now I'm coming for your ass fool

It's the return of the mad rapper, industry nigga subtracter
That be greed up in the fists, that be clinched like a black panther
I'm sick and tired of you fakers, that try to twist up the game
So now you gotta see me, like the 84's that I swang
My glock I cock and I aim, my name you fin to respect it
You let me off in your world, then I swear to God I'ma wreck it
You must of thought I forgot about you, acting sue a crowd'll watch you
I gotta get that up out you, your people gon be without you
On top of that, niggaz be using my homie name
Saying the Screwed Up Click, so they can get them a little change
Hopping from dick to dick, and I ain't even gon say no name
I feel like I want to click, so now you gon feel my pain
I'm Trae, and I ain't bar nan nigga in this drama
Or mama, I weave and I swang sending em through a trauma
They tell me to let em make it, but really I ain't the one
Them bitches did it, so now they gotta see me when I come

Where the real niggaz at, cause I can't find none
Everybody be talking shit, when they be packing they guns
Quick to shoot a motherfucker, to keep they face from sweating
But when the laws come to bang one, snitching and telling
Be these ol' buster ass niggaz, killing all in they music
Showing a four pound around town, but never gon use it
I'm registered by my gangsta, you barely touching me G
Now feel you got the edasity, to come and see me
Fuck it whoever want to get some, can come and get dropped
I'm a grown man I don't get people sued, I get people shot
If you ain't shot, I wonder who gon be standing behind the trigga
Z-Ro the Crooked, cause ain't no love for none of these niggaz
Straight Profit to Presidential, trying to scandalize my name
They can't sell records without me, that's a god damn shame
I ain't to blame, why these niggaz ain't selling and losing weight
But I'm to blame, when I go off and get the bruising they face

Make a nigga hot, yeeeah
Why you want to hate me, S.U.C.
You niggaz can't be meeee
My nigga T-are-A-E
And that's the way it's gonna be
Until a motherfucker take me
Me, and the M double A-be	
We gon be thugging
Until we see you niggaz to see

Straight up, it's my cousin Trae nigga
These bitch ass niggaz can't fuck with you

From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth
From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth
From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth

Hold up a minute, I'm the King of the Ghetto
Holding the rap game, like wood grain can't let go
You niggas'll never see me, I'm on another level
Stay ready to dig a grave, keep a gun and a shovel
And pouring gas too, if there evidence
Saw me in the rear view, now you wonder where I went
I'm a get you if I owe ya, visit ya residence
Lay the merk game down, and then I'ma hit the fence
Better keep my mouth closed, so they can't see the shining
They think it was Z-Ro, cause all they seen was diamonds
I'm cold as a deep freeze, with bags of ice in it
My 3-57 pretty, but ain't nothing nice in it
Too many bitches, and not enough rubbers
Got so many, all my real niggaz under the gutter
Watch a nigga full of life, light close like shutters
God damn, staying healthy is hard as a mo'fucker

I got diamonds all in my mouth, in my grill and in my jaws
Platinum teeth and princess cuts, my mouth is similar to a disco ball
I'm Paul Wall my smile is blinding, my ice is shining like a chandelier
I tend to brush my teeth with Windex, just so the glass house mouth shine clear
I got mo' karats invested with soup, I'm a Texas icon a People's Champ
Put on your shades when I commits to approach, my mouth is eliminating like a lamp
It got gold grills and platinum and ice, cause that's how it is in the Lone Star State
With a cup full of bar in a candy car, and we jamming on a Robert Davis Grey Tape

From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth
From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth

Ever since 1999, I had diamonds in my grill
You just rapping that ain't platinum, homie you need to chill
Cause you embarrassing Texas, nigga you ain't trill
Nigga you been on my dick, way befo' you got your deal
These rappers finally get some fame, and think they got it locked
After your album flop, nigga you gon be on Koch
My gear clean, from my ear rings to my pinky ring
If you ain't spend thirty, tuck in your piece and chain (Southside)

If I'm looking agitated, bitch you better run hoe
I use to do the baguettes, but now I'm VS-1's though
Princess cuts straight up and down, Johnny done those
I got loud ice, just like Paul Wall
Shining down South, brighter than all y'all
When it's time to get your jewelry done who do y'all call
Cause you fellas ain't shining at all, check me out
On the first and fifteenth, I'm some'ing like a pimp
Even with a suspended license, still finna flip
Ain't no limit to this cash, ain't nothing I can't get
Five deuce Hoover cause, ain't nothing like a Crip
Ride with a Revolve', I don't fuck with clips
These roach ass niggaz, trying to make me bust my chips
But I'm not a bank, I don't even trust my bitch

Lately he been flippin' and, stayin' on the grind
Tellin' you that you fine, but he ain't spendin' no time
I be pourin' wine, tryin' to, knock out your spine
Make you mine, from behind, to some slowed down ""Bump n' Grind""
His thang like a dirty Sweet, from off the street
My thang like a O' of indo, from Sacramento
Lately y'all been monkeyin', he, call you a bitch
Keep me all up in yo' shit, try'na dig you a new ditch
Now I admit, that he rich, and that his money is good
Got my dicked sucked in his 'Six, I'm fuckin' on leather and wood
I'm just a yougin' from the hood, with some dick if ya good
With him, you know that you shouldn't
With me, you know that you should
Go pussy thug, like a glove when I push and I shove
Knock a dime out the climb, cause I ain't makin' love
See yo' man the type of guy, to get jealous and hit'cha
But me, I lick ya where he don't, and suck real hard on yo' nipple
My game is sharp as a cicle, she love my pickle
And if you gave her a dime, nigga she gave me a nickel
So while you thinkin', she done jet, she got my dick on her mind
Keep on neglectin' yo' gal, young Pimp C be spendin' yo' time

Is'a playa
Is'a mack
I love gettin to this ladies
But not more than these paper stacks
Now rule one, get your cash on m.o.b.
Keep paper in my pocket my nigga p.i.m.p
Don't hate me major
Just hate the game
The only reason your woman diggin' me 
Is cause I play with things
Don't take it personal my nigga
I dont love I'ma playa
She just gon' keep me company
While I get lifted and I lay her

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well naturally, I have to be, dead serious, maybe not
Let me tell a tale about this broad that thought she played me out
Yes, I was impressed, by the sex in her ass
W-U-I-S her, Versacci, down like Fran, dress her, bless her heart
She was a sweet-tart, but'cha never understood her point in our duo
Talkin' smart wit' all that ""you know"", comin' wit' he-say, she-say
From what she heard at the club, bout some chick that I had played on
Well bitch, you should have stayed home
She mad cause I done told her girl off, but the bitch was wrong, and you
You gon' let these messy ho's fuck yo' world off
I tried to love her man, but see love is one thang, and dumb is anotha'
Brotha', I'd be dumb to let her run thangs
I should've passed, but I was gassed, super-unleaded
And her nappy-headed ass gon' regret it, remember I said it
Cause I'm, in a sublime, new state and frame of mind
Cause it'd be a crime, for me to waste my time
My time

[Chorus]

(Verse 3, Twista]
Did you ever think about who's ass ya girl's was
Before the booty had became yours?
If a nigga's sane flows, you know everything goes
Fuckin' in it til' it's colorful as rainbows
Sportin' furry Kango's, she can't go, rockin' paid shows
Paper hard to fold, plus I roll slick, keep talkin' shit
If you don't like me, it's most like-ly, cause I done holla'd at yo bitch
Why she so thick? Tellin' lies and ya said to be believin' 'em
But I make her feel like ""Uh-huh"", can you do it? ""Uh-huh""
But when I scoop her up, she know that I'm the one to make a slut-cum
Gotta man, he a lame anyway, mother-fuck that stuff
Mad cause I snuck that love, baby don't bust that slug
So go on head roll up that bud, so we can fuck
So wassup? Now we in the Suburb', submerged, watch a movie
Or bumpin' U-G, K shit, scoop a bitch or hit the booty
How the man, yea I knew g, but she don't usually, say shit
Cause the pussy make a motherfucka' wanna ball up and cry
Chicka-pow-pow, I love them thighs when I'm rollin' aside
I ain't gon' up and die, like the guy that we got high
Take away more than two hits, two blows
She heard my new shit, it was new clothes
New golds, carefully Herringbones, and cell-phones
But her friend home, now I'm freakin' two ho's
If ya girl be wit' me, somethin' nifty, she prob'ly wanna lick me
I'm the Twista, I flame a ho pissy drunk and drippy

Sold a lot of records and grabbed somethin'

And everyday I try to stack my grip and make three songs
I'm try'na get my mothafuckin' paper on
I want the new (bone?) and the new cell phone
I want the new two way pager and the new mansion home
In Houston cause that is my city

I remember when I had to come up just to come down
That's the reason for my uncontrollable ballin' right now
Use to be scared to walk in the store I payed the price now
My life is to valuable for me to play with life now
Of course it's gon' be some niggas who think I done changed
They find me guility just because now I got diamonds on every thing
My mouth and my pinky ring, my wrist and my neck
I'm 'bout my business so give me my cash or give me my check
See I can biblically remember me and Trae on the block
Even more then hustlin' sometimes we had to lay on the block
Eat, sleep, shit, piss, pray on the block
To make it through the night to see another day on the block
Movin' rocks got us full pockets-plus knots in our socks
But now money be comin' in wadd's like blocks

Who would've known that this rap shit would take me far
At 18 I had a fifty-thousand dollar car
I went from Jag to Benz but not the regular kind
Now I'm smokin' hydro not the regular pine
I spit one freestyle now I'm rockin' clubs
After ""Diamonds N Yo Face"" I was coppin' dubs
I had to make the transition from a boy to a man
So if you wanna 16 that's forty-grand
Rappers talk a lot of shit but you ain't stoppin' us
Look you don't wanna bump heads with a mafia (Huh)
Look you don't know shit about UGK
Or Mr. Fat Pat and Grey Screw tapes
I rep the Screwed Up Click peep the watch I'm wearin'
I'm the first cat in Houston with a black Meclaron
Lil' Flipper tote pistols for them none believers
Cause down here we poppin' trunks on Cadillacs and Regals (Oh boy)

Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin'

Down where the streets

Shot like a spark

Of dark despair

Will you, will you, will you marry me?
Will you, will you, will you marry me boy?
Will you, will you, will you, will you, come on baby now.

I'm standing here my heart's been sold.

You've got to go down

The choice is yours
The choice is yours
The choice is yours if you can find something better
The choice is yours

Just like it seems you know it really don't matter

Don't be a fool and take too long
To make your move
A woman like me deserves a knight
In armor too
I've been a good woman to you
Give you sweet love every night
Break up, make up
That's all that we do
So if you better want me love

You're like a long, cool glass of lemonade
Bitter, sweet and I want you so bad it hurts
You complete my life
And you quench my thirst, sexy

Sexy feelings just come over me
Playing with my dress like a summer breeze
Gentle as the touch of a falling leaf
You open me up to love
Now I gotta believe, gotta believe
 
Nothing's too good for my baby
Anything you want be free
It's the least that I can do
What you've given me, given me

Crazy cool with you
In this groove, crazy groove
Back act a fool
Hey I'm cool, crazy cool
You're crazy cool with me
In this groove, crazy cool
Everything you need, sexy

Laying in the grass
Writing poetry
Looking up at the midnight sun
When you're making love to me
You showed me just how cool
Crazy cool can be
Now I know the meaning of ecstasy, ecstasy

That's what I want
That's what I need
That's what I want
Ho-down

She sprays her lies around her like the clouds release the rain
And endless stream of promises that vaporize again
Remember last Tuesday when you said it was the end
You caught her in your Nissan getting funky with your best friend
She will never change till her flesh is under dirt
But then at least she's hangin' with neighbors she deserves
Forgive me if I seem to sound a little on the loose
But I cannot pour sugar just to sweeten up the truth

I would like to wish her to a long forgotten dream
Happened early morning when I was just two or three
Everyone around who didn't quite fit in the mix
Turned and waved goodbye and disappeared without a hitch
Except my friend Billy who live just across the way
The world belonged to us forever on from that day
Until we ran into that sneaky girl from down the street
Who tried to smile so pretty stealing Billy right from me

[Chorus]

The world spun around her everywhere that she would go
But even my friend Billy knew that she was just a - oh no
She had such a way to twist and turn a simple truth
Told my friend Billy I had been a little loose
Then Billy took her by the arm and left me standing all along
I just had to wait there watching them do-se-do
Till Billy pushed her in the deepest darkest hole around
It was goodbye sneaky girl - ho down

I would like to wish her for her a place to somewhere far
A place in outer space to some exotic little star
A million miles away would probably suit the planet fine
Someplace where it's clear she is gone and you are mine
Or maybe some romantic little island in the sea
As far away as it is possible to be
She can have the flowers and the wind
And I can have my baby back with me once again

[Chorus]

I would like to wish for her another little story
My daddy said to me when I was just a little girly
He told me 'bout a pretty graceful lovely lady bird
Who never could find a nest good enough for her
From every tree she landed in she saw one that was better
So off she went before she ever could regain her breath
Wasn't it a pity when she finally hit the ground
It was goodbye lovely birdy, ho down
Goodbye lovely birdy, ho down",Ho-Down,1995

There was something you've been dying to say

That you say you're in love with me
Now that's hard for me to believe

Cause I never knew it baby, never knew it baby
I never knew it baby, never knew it baby
That you loved me so
Now I think about you every night

Said you wanted for us to have fun
What's the matter, cat got your tongue
It's not easy to read your mind
So you bet not take too long
Kind of silly just holding the phone
Ain't it silly that I'm all alone
When you should be here holding me
Or making good love to me baby, oh so sweet

Standing on the chair to be grown up 
I feel so little, I need my pillow 
I hate the time, I hate the clock 
I want to be a dog or I want to be a rock 

Sunday's pancakes Miss Mary Mack 
Color Polariods show my heart attack 
In my second-hand pants and dusty shoes 
The day that the playground laughed at my shoes 
It's my birthday next week and what I want please 
Is to turn on the heat so the fish won't freeze 
The fish in the tank froze and died last week 
Oh I want to be a dog or I want to be a leaf

In my town of Bethlehem 
Picket fences, church at ten 
No star above my Bethlehem 

Now I'm only 16 and I think I have an ulcer 
I'm hiding my sex behind a dirty sweatshirt 
I've lost five pounds these past few days 
Trying to be class president and get straight A's, well, 
Who gives a shit about that anyway? 
I want to be a dog or a lump of clay

Tired of living - still 
Everyday I dream of leaving

The same ten girls, who don't know who they are 
They're looking for some comfort in the back of a car 
The six-packs of beer, the locker room jeers 
I don't want to be me, I don't want to be here

He could feel it in his stomach, he signed away his life

The little source of joy, always neatly dressed 
Now would hang his head and be left crying at his desk,

With two bullets in his chest

From universities, Africa, the Middle East 
And through the threats of death he spoke truth and set men free
But the power of the truth made enemies of the weak 
He was killed by his own people

Paula Cole,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,2005

Paula Cole,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so
The look of love

So many nights like this

And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

Yes, the strong gets more
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade
Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own
 
Money, you've got lots of friends
Crowding round the door
When you're gone, spending ends
They don't come no more
Rich relations give
Crust of bread and such

Paula Cole,"Your eyes they conjure up those Cliffs of Moher
Faraway and not listening anymore
Dreaming of life on another shore
Not here, not now, with me, the bore

So I stop talking and fade to bleak
Feeling insignificant, atrophied and weak
Even though it's not who I know myself to be
The Queen, the confidence
Doesn't speak

[Chorus:]
But I was 14 with my passion
And 15 with my best
16 with my ego
And zero with the rest
My heart is a P.O.W. tangled in my chest
I don't know how to communicate in a cardiac arrest

Your eyes they drown me in your sadness
Your words they bring hurricanes
Braving Shakespearean tempest
The mighty tiger
Doesn't blink

[Chorus]

I think I found the one
Silent suffering inside
The one who got away
I was too dangerous to hide

[Chorus]

So I stop talking, baby, 'cause you always want me to shut up
Take the center stage meanwhile I become your trusted, silent prop
So take good care, this mighty woman's ready to explode
Fire here below the surface of my volcano",14,2007
Paula Cole,"I'm black on blacker velvet
Milk skin and veins
Like some El Greco painting
So full of pain
So full of longing for light of day

I thought I knew who I was in the world
But here I am twice blind at being born
Crawling to my buried voice, within

And I've forgotten who I used to be
And I've forgotten the woman in red
Living her dream
And I've forgotten the courage I used to be

Happiness is overrated
It never lasts
Skating the surface of oceanic depths
Oh may the fruit of my life be meaning
So please forgive me all my seriousness
My so-called spirituality
I'm just a mess
I'm tears and anxiety
But I'm unafraid to see

And I've forgotten who I used to be
The leader in her glory shining, divining
And I've forgotten, the courage I used to be
The middle passage is so damned humbling, persona crumbling

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try, and I try

Like some El Greco painting
No sun or sky
No lantern, no candle needed to light
The holy radiance behind the eyes
And I've forgotten who I used to be
And I've forgotten the woman in red
Living her dream
And I've forgotten the courage I used to be

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try, and I try

My prince to save the day?
I've always paved my own way
I'm all alone
Bringing home the bread
Raising the kid, fixing the bed

[Chorus:]
I wanna be a star, Like Marilyn Monroe
A Cinderella fantasy, a naive Clara Bow
A princess and the pea, I try to play the part
Surrounded by society, hypnotizing me
It's hard to be soft

I'm all alone
Keeping the home alive
Making the meals
She's 9 to 5
I'm the only one
At the mommy and me
Looking for some company

Out there on my own
Successful in the world
It works to be so strong
But when I come home
My pendulum's outta control
I'm passive or I let my fire blow

I don't want to be a star
Like Marilyn Monroe
A Cinderella fantasy
A naive Clara Bow
A princess and the pea

Surrounded by society
Hypnotizing me to be
Home-baked apple pie
A centerfold in heels

Oh won't you marry me?

Paula Cole,"(Holding on, holding on, holding on...)
Here in this vacancy
Where we existed
I carry on in life like some puppet acting her part

The very core of me
An empty garden
The tree of life once flowered her arms to open sky

An angel guided you home, now I'm alone, now I'm alone
The living on's the hardest part
And the days are endless hours

This house is silent now
The bed's much bigger
The television's constant to keep me company

The Maker guided you home
Now I'm alone, now I'm alone
The living on's the hardest part
And the days are endless hours

But then at night when my soul is in flight
And together we meet in the galaxy
Love know no lease
We're here in the meadow of grace and peace
We meet again in our dreams

So if you hear me now
'Cause I know you're out there
Wait for my homecoming when I cross the other side

A little bird flew you home
Now I'm alone, now I'm alone
The living on's the hardest part
And the days are endless hours

But then at night when my soul is in flight
And together we meet in the galaxy

Paula Cole,"Spin the globe, stop and start
Come to a place that's torn apart
Here's a secret, it's my heart
Oh well
It's only...

Broken shutters, whistling wind
Vultures circling overhead
Tumbleweeds fly
Dust in my eyes
Guess it's not my feelings crying

Peeling paint on empty homes
Where people lived in this town long ago
Packed their bags, nailed down the door
To Lonelytown

Oh I once had a love of my life
The sun of my soul
But I took him for granted
Ignored all the signs
And now it's just memories and passing ghosts

Spiderwebs and weeds waist high
Abandoned schoolyards and rusted wire
Looking for love
Looking for life
In Lonelytown

If you're lucky with a love of your own
Remember this in a nutshell I've told
Hold them close and don't let go
And cherish forevermore
Or you will live in Lonelytown",Lonelytown,2007

Into the glass he flies
The perfect partner he does spy
A moment's glance of eyes
Reflections of a future love
Feel the pull of fate

Himself in haste and vain
Passion's flash of red
Bloodied on the pane

You are my lovelight
You are my lovelight
You are my lovelight
Blinded by surprise
You are my lovelight
You are my lovelight

All the qualities I loved
Now bite me black and blue
All the joys you loved in me
Come biting back at you

Till death do us our shadows part
Make room through all these tears
Till something new appears
Reborn in this nadir

From across the room 
You're wearing your anguish again 
Believe me I know the feeling 
It sucks you into the jaws of anger 
Oh, so breathe a little more deeply my love

Yeah, I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me

I saw you with your new girl just yesterday
And I feel that I must confess
Even though it kills me to have to say
I'll admit that I was impressed
Physically just short of perfection
Gotta commend you on your selection
Though I know I shouldn't be concerned
In the back of my mind I can't help but question

Does she rub your feet
When you've had a long day
And scratch your scalp
When you take out your braids?
Does she know you like to play PS2
Till six in the morning like I do

I can't explain this feeling (yeah)
I think about it everyday
And even though we've moved on (uh huh)

Hopin' maybe you'll come back
And though I tell myself not to be afraid
To move on but it seems I can't
Though a new man has given me attention
It ain't the same as your affection
But I know I should be content
In the back of my mind
I can't help but question

Does he kiss me on the forehead
Before we play?
Show up on my doorstep
With a bouquet
Does he call me in the middle of the day
Just to say, baby, I love you
Like you used to?

I can't explain this feeling (I can't explain, yeah)
I think about it everyday (everyday)
And even though we've moved on (moved on, uh huh)
It gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (Forever you will live in my memory) (Walk away)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I can't forget how we used to be)

I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
The things we did, the way we shared our fantasies
Just you and me, my friend, my love, my family
How did we lose the love that was meant to be?
Sometimes I kiss her, and wish that it was you that I'm kissin'
Sometimes I miss him, and wish that it was you that I'm missin'
Sometimes I hug her, and wish that it was you that I'm huggin'
And I realized how much I'm buggin'
I miss you

So how do I express this feeling?
'Cause nobody compares to you
And you know that she'll never love you like I do

Baby, listen to me
Please don't walk out that door
'Cause if you ever need me
I'd be lost, I'd be going crazy

'Cause I don't want nobody else

I see something wrong, insecurity
When all along I was trying make it right

And a player will probably play ya
But a player thinks he's sticking with you
Not a streets-create, so much distrust
That I'd probably be ready to break it to you

We can kick it in the morning we can make it in the evening
Stroll through the park with the Cali smoke grievin'
Believe it, I wouldn't even leave you for nothin'

What makes her just everything that I can never be?

Looking dressed to impress

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

Se é dia eu ando mais veloz
E à noite todos os faróis
Iluminando a escuridão

Eu sei, 'to correndo ao encontro dela
Coração 'tá disparado
Mas eu ando com cuidado
Não me arrisco na banguela

Eu sei, todo dia nessa estrada
No volante eu penso nela
Já pintei no pára-choque
Um coração e o nome dela

Já rodei o meu país inteiro
Como bom caminhoneiro
Peguei chuva e cerração
Quando chove o limpador desliza
Vai e vem no pára-brisa
Bate igual meu coração

Doido pelo doce do seu beijo
Olho cheio de desejo
O seu retrato no painel
É no acostamento dos seus braços
Que eu desligo meu cansaço
E me abasteço desse mel

Eu sei, 'to correndo ao encontro dela
Coração 'tá disparado
Mas eu ando com cuidado
Não me arrisco na banguela

Eu sei, todo dia nessa estrada
No volante eu penso nela
Já pintei no pára-choque
Um coração e o nome dela

Todo dia quando eu pego a estrada
Quase sempre é madrugada
E o meu amor aumenta mais
Olho o horizonte e vou em frente

'To com Deus e 'to contente
O meu caminho eu sigo em paz

Eu sei, 'to correndo ao encontro dela
Coração 'tá disparado
Mas eu ando com cuidado
Não me arrisco na banguela

Paula Fernandes,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I dreamed of once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true

Oh, someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me

Birds fly over the rainbow

Paula Fernandes,"Se algum dia algo te lembrar
E a emoção tocar inteira a face do teu rosto
Não se envergonhe em dizer
Que o ciúme levou teu amor
E te afastou de vez de mim
E a voz do teu silêncio
Não me deixou opção

Acreditei na força do teu querer
Mas o ciúme foi maior que você
Ressentimento cegou minha visão
Aquele amor virou antiga paixão

Te aceito, assim, complicado demais
Também sou assim, complicada demais
E já faz tempo que o tempo parou
Não envelheço à espera do teu amor

Se nos sentimos como a terra e o mar
E o desamor desfez um sonho lindo desse jeito 
Feito uma nuvem no céu
Eu não queria mesmo acreditar
Que um ser humano tão sereno
Fosse assim o oposto 
A fim de causar confusão

Eu estarei aqui esperando você
Se redimindo do teu erro pra ver
Teus olhos rasos, decididos a voltar
Sem ter ciúme, vem pra mim, vem me amar

Paula Fernandes,"De onde é que vem esses olhos tão tristes?
Vem da campina onde o sol se deita
Do regalo de terra que o teu dorso ajeita
E dorme serena, no sereno sonha

De onde é que salta essa voz tão risonha?
Da chuva que teima, mas o céu rejeita
Do mato, do medo, da perda tristonha
Mas, que o sol resgata, arde e deleita

Há uma estrada de pedra que passa na fazenda
É teu destino, é tua senda, onde nascem tuas canções
As tempestades do tempo que marcam tua história
Fogo que queima na memória e acende os corações

Sim, dos teus pés na terra nascem flores
A tua voz macia aplaca as dores
E espalha cores vivas pelo ar
Ah, ah, ah
Sim, dos teus olhos saem cachoeiras
Sete lagoas, mel e brincadeiras
Espumas ondas, águas do teu mar
Ah, ah, ah
êeh laiá",Jeito De Mato,2011

Sem você, sou menos que a metade
Sou incapacidade de viver por mim
Sem você, eu sem você

Eu tô carente desse teu abraço
Desse teu amor que me deixa leve
Eu tô carente desses olhos negros
Desse teu sorriso branco feito neve
Eu tô carente desse olhar que mata
Dessa boca quente revirando tudo
Tô com saudade dessa cara linda
Me pedindo fica só mais um segundo

Tô feito mato desejando a chuva
Madrugada fria esperando o sol
Tô tão carente feito um prisioneiro
Vivo um pesadelo, beijo sem paixão
Tô com vontade de enfrentar o mundo
Ser pra sempre o guia do seu coração
Sou a metade de um amor que vibra
Numa poesia em forma de canção

Sem você, sou caçador sem caça
Sem você, a solidão me abraça
Sem você, sou menos que a metade
Sou incapacidade de viver por mim

Sem você, sou caçador sem caça
Sem você, a solidão me abraça
Sem você, sou menos que a metade
Sou incapacidade de viver por mim
Sem você, sem você, oh
Sem você, eu sem você, sem você",Eu Sem Você,2012
Paula Fernandes,"Não foi no mesmo instante em que aconteceu
Nem foi aquele estranho brilho que eu senti
Foi mais do que espanto dos meus olhos abertos
Na onda desses sonhos que eu percorri

Me lembro do toque desse sentimento
Ardendo e pulsando fortemente
Tão clara como a hora em que eu decidi
Pegar a estrada rara do destino
E fiz mais mudo o silêncio que eu nunca ouvi
E carrego o nome do que está aqui dentro

Vem me ensinar o que sabe de cor

Paula Fuga,"But there is no combination of words I could put on a post card
No song that I could sing, but I can try because this is your heart
Our dreams, and they are made out of real things
Like a, shoe box of photographs
Sepia-toned loving
Love is the answer,
At least for most of the questions in my heart
Why are we here? And where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy and
Sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing, it's so much better when we're together

Mm, it's so much better when we're together
Well it's so much better when we're together
Yeah, it's so much better when we're together
Mm, so much better when we're together

And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
Or brings new things
For tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too
Too many things I gotta do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two, just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Well it's so much better when we're together
Mm, we're somewhere in between together
Mm, it's so much better when we're together
Yeah, it's so much better when we're together

I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
Hey now, and when I wake up,
You look so pretty sleeping next to me
But there is, there is not enough time,
And there is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together

Paula Kelly,"Me and my wife live all alone 
In a little log hut we're all our own
She loves gin and I love rum, 
And don't we have a lot of fun! 

Ha, ha, ha, you and me, 
Little brown jug, don't I love thee! 
Ha, ha, ha, you and me, 
Little brown jug, don't I love thee! 
When I go toiling on the farm 
I take the little jug under my arm

Place it under a shady tree, 
Little brown jug, 'tis you and me. 
'Tis you that makes me friends and foes, 
'Tis you that makes me wear old clothes
But, seeing you're so near my nose, 
Tip her up and down she goes. 

If all the folks in Adam's race 
Were gathered together in one place, 
Then I'd prepare to shed a tear
(I'd let them go without a tear) 
Before I'd part from you, my dear. 

If I'd a cow that gave such milk, 
I'd dress her in the finest silk; 
Feed her up on oats and hay, 
And milk her twenty times a day. 

I bought a cow from Farmer Jones, 
And she was nothing but skin and bones
I fed her up as fine as silk, 
She jumped the fence and strained her milk. 

And when I die don't bury me at all, 
Just pickle my bones in alcohol
I'ut a bottle o' booze at my head and feet 
And then I know that I will keep.

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2006

Whispering your name as they do? 
And why have I the feeling stars are on my ceiling?

When you smile at me 
I hear gypsy violins 
When you dance with me

Pauletta Washington,"Looking back on when I started
Had a lot of sun and a lot of rain
I had some joy and broken hearted
But now that doesn't mean a thing
I'm living for the joy and laughter
Longing for my befores and afters
All in all it's been cool
And there's nothing I wouldn't do
I'm so happy being me

[Chorus]
Oh
So happy being me
I'm regretting noting about me
Too busy living life, living love, freely
So happy being me

Stop reaching back from your beginnings
All those broken dreams that went down stream
As we grow, live and know
Some things were never meant to be
Just like people they come and go
Some will live forever and some will never know
That's why god gives us memories
To leave us to our victories
I'm so happy loving me

[Chorus]

All those hidden treasures
Feeling nothing but pleasure
We could never replace, is love (We can't no we can't no)
The sunlight leads us to a place and moonlight keeps us in it's grace
I'm so happy being me

I called you late last night

Did you tell her she was sleeping

Si queremos andar el camino
Hay que ser valientes

Vivir el día a día, no es una sinfonía
Se hace duro tener que pensarte
Sin llegar a verte, y es que túy

Representas mi fantasía, pero hoy
No es el tiempo para soñar

Nieva, nieva
En mi primavera
Un mundo, irreal
Nieva, nieva
Y como el viento
Vuela mi mente a donde estás

Nieva, nieva
Sobre mi alma nieva
Soy hielo si no estás

Y aunque duela, esta larga espera
Habrá un bello final, soñar será tontería
Pero sigue acercándonos
Esta prueba que es como un examen
Nos hace más fuertes

Y es que hoy
Que valoro escuchar tu risa
Y extrañar
Ese aliento sobre mi piel

Ya no nieva
Ni noches en vela
Ya todo es realidad
Ya no nieva

En mis primaveras
Llegaste hasta el final
Llegaste hasta el final

Nieva, nieva

Paulina Aguirre,"Nunca le hemos dedicado una canción a los morros
So esta canción se las vamos a dedicar a ellos
Son historias, como nos las sabemos así que nunca digan
Que no hacemos nada para los niños

Escuchen he ahí les va

Desde niño yo he tenido cuentos pa' contar
Cosas medias atrevidas pero no vulgar
Algunas son mentiritas pero de a verdad
Déjame, te cuento dame otra oportunidad

Una vez en el bosque, me tope con un chavo
Era de palo con tirantes chapeados
Iba chiflando cargaba su mochila
Curioso yo le pregunte pa' donde iba

Iba de gira el cabrón
Se la había pintado por andar de mamon
Dijo que andaba en busca de una chinita
Porque caperucita le salió embarazadita

Me amenazo con sus pinches amiguitos
Son la pandilla de los tres cochinitos
Ya me conto que cuentearon al lobo
Que fue en defensa propia que fue por un robo

Sin darme cuenta olvide que era jueves
Tenía una cita con mi novia blanca nieves
Ponte las pilas me dijeron sus hermanos
Porque anda de caliente con uno de los enanos

Se me hiso noche y me puse a buscar
En el bosque donde me iba a quedar
Casa de citas bueno ya de menos
Era de pan con arcos de caramelo

Toque la puerta, salió una viejita
Tenía visita fumando una pipa
Me dijo joven que rollos no gusta
Tengo dos morros guisándose en la estufa

Desde niño yo he tenido cuentos pa' contar
Cosas medias atrevidas pero no vulgar
Algunas son mentiritas pero de a verdad
Déjame, te cuento dame otra opo

Hey, hey, hey, hey

Te la contaron mal guey
Pinocho no embarazo a caperucita
Ya todos saben que es flojita

A mí me contaron los enanos
Que es una bicicleta y le gustaban Mexicanos
Les pregunte que donde escucharon
Me contesto el mas menso que ya todos se la echaron

Que no sabiendo quien es
Iban a la clínica los jueyes a sacarse un test
Me quede medio espantado lo bueno
Que no saben que también me la había echado

Ojala y no me toque, ya la manosearon
Todos los compas aquí en el bloque
Y me contaron lo de la bella durmiente
Que es bien borracha y le gusta el ambiente

Según le hizo un hechizo a la viejita
Ni madres anoche andaba pueda agatitas
La vi en la fiesta con la cenicienta
Una morra pobre que antes era una sirvienta
Ahora pasa y ni le habla a la raza
Anda en un carro que parece calabaza

Son jaladoras y bonitas las muchachas
A mí se me hace que las dos son marimachas
Dicen que son amigas desde chiquitas
Y por eso se agasajan cuando se echan sus copitas

Es como me contaron a mí las historias
Y son exactas según a mis memorias
Nomás no estoy seguro del embarazo
A ver como chingados me va con este caso

Ja, ja, ja así es morros ojala y
Les haya gustado la canción
Que les dedicamos
Porque así es como nosotros
Nos acordamos de esas historias

Pero si ustedes se las saben de otra manera
O well, esto ya se acabo nosotros ya nos vamos
Guau bye, bye

Me ponen maremotos en las venas

No habia que buscar ni la occasion
Ni el sitio para oirte, con la voz tan ronca

Abriendo las puertas al amor
Siguiendo el instinto, nos bastaba

Y el sol no dejaba de brillar

Abriendo las puertas al amor
Haciendo camino de la mano
De color de rosa, escribimos la historia
Y quieres poner punto final

No lo ves, que tu aire es el aire que respiro
Que me apago cuando tu no estas conmigo
Y los celos me torturan sin para

Hablame, oye nunca dime de una vez por todas
Te has cansado ya de mi y estoy de sobra
Si es que hay otra, quiero saber la verdad

Me tragare el orgullo una vez mas
Te perdonare todo, siendo de tu boca

Me llevo el recuerdo de tu piel dorada
Buscando el olvido en el camino, uh oh
Viene a mi el deseo de recordar ah
Quítame esta absurda soledad
Imagino que tu estas conmigo
Me hablas
Entre tanto why tanto caminar
Recuerdo tu cara
Me falta la luz de tu mirada, no
Why me sobran ganas de volver

Refrão:
A ti, volver, regresar
Tiraré hacia atrás
Sabes bien, porque, quiero estar
Yo te quiero amar (2x)

Buscando el olvido en el camino
En cambio el deseo de recordar

Paulina Rubio,"Cuando te ví, todo me cambió
Why te enganché a mi corazón
Aunque yo sé, que eso es un error
Lo que me das, es más fuerte que yo

Maldito amor, ciego
Maldito amor, te vengas de mí
Maldito amor, siento
Eres tu, vives en mi

Me mentiré una why otra vez
Simularé que me caes muy bien
No temblaré si me das un beso
Toca mi piel why después me reiré

Maldito amor quiero
Un poco más, libre seguir
Maldito amor, miento
Ven aquí, me gusta sufrir

Cuanto pensé, no volver a verte
Creas o no, mi alma se rebeló

Maldito amor, eres

Para mí, arma letal

Brillan las miradas, mas que las medallas por donde paso
No hago nada por llamar la atencion, soy de lo mas normal
No acabo de comprender, lo que les doy sin querer.

Que es lo que tengo, para que se mueran por mis huesos
En el espejo soy igual que todas, no veo nada especial
Porque se derriten asi, en cuanto empiezo a bailar
No trato nunca de provocar, pero es igual, se que pierdo el tiempo.

CORO...
Dime si soy sexy, dime si soy sexy
Cuenta me ya la verdad
Dime si soy sexy, soy o no soy sexy
Por favor, dimelo ya.

Cuentame ya la verdad
Dime si soy sexy, soy o no soy sexy
Por favor, dimelo ya.

Entro en el mercado why hay terremoto devastador, que pasa, que?

Paulina Rubio,"Tu lo prometiste, dijiste escribiré
Ha pasado mucho tiempo, no resistiré
Mis amigas me preguntan, no se que decir
Esta fiesta me atormenta, solo pienso en ti

Me siento atrapada, alma engañada
Pero enamorada, enamorda de ti

Enamorada, enamorada, enamorada de ti
Desilusionada, me siento engañada
Pero enamorada

Todas esas noches, hablábamos de amor
Jugabas con caricias suaves
Flechando mi corazon

Te escribo esta cara, loca esperanza
Tu dime se el amor es cierto, me alejarede ti

Amor fatal, pasión fugaz, besar tu piel
Te hecho de menos, no puedo mas
De amor por ti",Enamorada,1996
Paulina Rubio,"Me quieres, why me mientes
Me deseas, why no llegas
Me amas, why te callas
Te busco, me huyes

Un tres de abril, una tarde más
Cuando el sol se despedía
Llegaba su final

Una historia más, una realidad
De piel why aventura
Deseo criminal

El destino marca fuertes cambios para él
Por que tropezó con algo que nunca vió

Atracción, dos sombras juego de amor
Pasión que lo contaminó
Sin darse nombres se amaban por horas
La advertencia fue clara

Una historia más, dormía la ciudad
Un cariño irresponsable, difícil de escapar

Que me hable la luna, acariciar el alma
Que me enfríe un poco el viento

Y enamorarme otro día
Miedo, me da mucho miedo
Al solo pensar caer en el desprecio
Miedo, me da mucho miedo
Acercarme al fuego y luego un hasta luego

Quiero caminar en la arena, correr en praderas
Perderme entre la lluvia

Y coquetear sin pena

La pasión que quede escondida
Y enamorarme otro día",Miedo,1996

Que queman mas que el sol 
Andando de puntillas

Soy la miel y la sal vivo con intensidad

Únete al juego y la magia

Eso de planear futuro, siempre acompañándonos

Donde la buena y el malo al final siempre quedan bien

Que vienes solo a la guerra, en contra de un gran batallón
Pero me juego por ti del todo y de una sola vez,
Tanta emoción me impresiona y estoy segura que esta vez

Lo haré por ti, porque lo siento,
Porque tu me elevas, como la hoja al viento,
Y cuando me besas, siento que disparas
En medio de mi alma

Porque es tu mirada, ver el mismo cielo,
Y cuando te beso, siento que disparas
En medio de mi alma

Todos aquellos sucesos, que me pusieron de bajón
Y si amar es aprender, tu amor es una gran lección
Y aquí­ me lanzo de nuevo en una sola dirección

I'm bouncing off the wall, the way you turn me on
I think I like this song, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo

Deep in the scene, like the music getting fascinating
Touching the screen, like the view from my imagination
Ninety degrees, got me circulating
I've been waiting, Impatiently
Got me changing stations on occasion

Can you connect with me?
If it's alright your satellite can be my energy

Don't want to be too bizarre but you're the key to my heart
You're my electric guitar, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo

Survive the people's faces, they're dancing from temptation
Her icky style is wasted, you don't need no invitation

De que en alguna parte se te cruzo un cable
No puedo hablarte why me muero de risa

Pero no problema ese es mi nuevo emblema

Esta prohibido
De tener que compartirlo
Porque se que tu me amas

Dentro de ti
Why soy tu alimento
El amor que te faltaba
La sonrisa en tu mirada
El mejor de tus secretos
El motivo de tus sueos...

Amargas me saben

Ayúdame a no olvidar jamás 
A sentir la brisa del mar 
Como aquellos tiempos 

Si tú te vas, la vida no será ningún lugar de sueños 
Como el que yo quiero 
Para mí, para ti 
Para ti, para mí 

Como sales why te vas sin decir adiós 
Delirio pensando que estás en mi habitación 
Sin ti, no hay brisa del mar 
Sin ti, todo me da igual 

Ayúdame a no olvidar jamás 
Why sentir la brisa del mar 
Como aquellos tiempos 

Si tú te vas, la vida no será 
Ningún lugar de sueños 
Como el que yo quiero 
Para mí, para ti 
Para ti, Para mí 

La verdad esta en tus ojos 
Why lo que veo es lo que quiero 

Ayúdame a no olvidar jamás 
Why sentir la brisa del mar 
Como aquellos tiempos 

Si tú te vas, la vida no será 
Ningún lugar de sueños 
Como el que yo quiero 
Para mi

Quiero olvidar que me dejaste así
Algunas noches fácil voy a ser
Si es que te duele tanto

Me gustaría que te hablen de mí
Me gustaría que sufras así
Pero no hay tiempo para hablar de ti
Alguien me espera abajo

No quiero ver
Quiero ver, quiero ver
No quiero verte hoy

Hoy
No quiero ver
Quiero ver, quiero ver
No quiero verte hoy

Hoy desperté why de nada me acordé
No sé muy bien ni a dónde ni por qué
Ni lo que hice lo hice para qué
Algo te duele adentro

No quiero ver
Quiero ver, quiero ver
No quiero verte hoy

Hoy
No quiero ver
Quiero ver, quiero ver

¿A dónde vas?
¿Con quién estás?
No me importa más
Desde hare tanto tiempo

Hoy desperté why de nada me acordé
No sé muy bien a dónde ni por qué
Ni lo que hice lo hice para qué
Algo te duele adentro

Sigo siendo la de siempre
Pero a veces tengo suerte
El que busca la revancha
Solo sabe lo que siente

No quiero verte hoy, no
No quiero ver
Quiero ver, quiero verte
No quiero verte hoy

Desde mi cama vero amanecer 
Dulce y fatal como el deseo 
Con tu brillo me confundo otra vez

Me duele cuando vuelvo a despertar

Y no volverán 
Creí poder volar 
Sólo pude llegar

Quitándote las gafas

Ya no son más que una historia

Ay ay ay ay
No pretendo volver a empezar
Sólo quiero sentir tu calor

Ay ay ay ay
Que mañana no llegue jamás
Que esta última noche de amor
No tenga final

La distancia llegará
Why volverá tan dulce tu recuerdo

Fue tan fácil prometer
Porque tú estarías para siempre junto a mí

De la música, de tu voz; suana aún en mis sueños

why me siento rara, al volverte a oír
Besos en un lado, ahora es así

Te quiero porque sé que puedo, porque sabe el mundo
Entero el tiempo que te espero

Quizá todo es mentira, si el amor te llama

La vida que es una señal de interrogación

Girándome entre círculos

Alimento mi alma soñando que

Yo quiero, mis días vivirlos contigo
La fuerza, la mano de ser más que amigos
Yo quiero, mi vida refugiarme en ti 
Y desde ahora refugiarme en ti

Frenética la mágia que 
Desprende la luz de tu corazón
Y entonces yo me aferro más 
De estar a tu lado esa es mi misión

Mis emociones se estancionarán 
Voy a dejarlas solo para ti

Entonces tú me llevas, en medio de tu dulce melodía, de tu alma 
Y entonces me conviertes en esa madrugada, en esa dulce brisa de tu mirada

En todo lo que hago, espíritu persigo 
Y giro en medio de la luz de tus sentidos
Y todo lo que quiero es cuando estoy contigo
Cuando descanso en tu dulce pecho amándome

Entre la posibilidad de verte enternamente
Entre la sensibilidad de amarte para siempre
Entonces aún al multiplicar no seré más familia 
Y de las notas del amor será nuestra semilla

Came to this party looking for fun
I saw this hotter looking like a number one
He was so suave, said ""baby, come""
We did that until we saw the morning sun

Boys will be boys
They like to play around
You shot me with your love gun
I'm falling to the ground
Boys will be boys
They like to play around
So tell me how to love one
That's running like a hound
Boys will be boys
They like to play around
You shot me with your love gun

Me gustas tanto que sólo pienso en ti
Te veo pasando y no sé qué decir
Me encantaría que sepas lo que siento por ti
Qué no daría porque fueras sólo para mí

Aun no sé qué fue lo que me hechizo de ti
Nunca pensé que cupido me iba a flechar así
Una sóla vez estuviste frente a mí
Y me enamore en el momento en que te vi

Es lo que siento yo cuando estoy cerca de ti
Es algo químico que se apodera de mí
Será tu físico que me hipnotizó
Es irónico que yo pueda decirte que me gustas tanto

Yo soñaría que tus besos fueran para mí

Ya lo sé, te gusto yo y también tu a mí
Igual que sé, que tú estarás loquito por mí
Una y otra vez sigo pensando en ti
Es volverte a ver lo que yo anhelo sin fin

Pero ya llego la hora de que te pegues a mi
Y terminemos bailando
de que te pegues a mi y terminamos bailando
de que te pegues a mi y terminamos bailando

Que me psicoanalicen
Que me hagan lo que sea
Mientras tú vengas y regreses

Te espero en la casa
La puerta está abierta
Y Siempre lo ha estado
Por si tú regresas
Ven dame la vida
Un beso me basta
Para recuperar todo lo que
Me hace falta
Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life

Intento continuar mi vida
Pero mire donde mire
Veo tu retrato
Ok, y para que decir mentiras
Sabes que yo para amarte
Siempre fui un novato

Solo me quedan huellas de tu
Bye, bye, bye
Mientras nuestra historia ya
Es historia
Si supieras que me ahoga
Tanta libertad
My life is over (Magan)

Calma este tsunami
Que arrasa en todo mi interior
Sin ti no hay nada de mí
No Music, no life
No hay nada por lo que ser yo

And I do not feel the romance I do not catch the spark
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
And I do not feel the romance I do not catch the spark

I don't know when I noticed life was life at my expense
The words of my heart lined up like prisoners on a fence
The dreams came in like needy children tugging at my sleeve
I said I have no way of feeding you, so leave
But there was a time I asked my father for a dollar
And he gave it a ten dollar raise
And when I needed my mother and I called her
She stayed with me for days
Now someones on the telephone, desperate in his pain
Someones on the bathroom floor doing her cocaine
Someones got his finger on the button in some room
No one can convince me we aren't gluttons for our doom
But I tried to make this place my place
I asked for providence to smile upon me with his sweet face
Yeah but Ill tell you

And I do not feel the romance I do not catch the spark
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
(By grace, my sight grows stronger)
And I do not feel the romance I will not be
(And I will not be a pawn for the prince of darkness any longer)

Maybe there's no haven in this world for tender age
My heart beat like the wings of wild birds in a cage
My greatest hope my greatest cause to grieve
And my heart flew from its cage and it bled upon my sleeve
Oh the cries of passion were like wounds that needed healing
I couldn't hear them for the thunder
I was half the naked distance between hell and heavens ceiling
And he almost pulled me under
Now someones on the telephone, desperate in his pain
Someones on the bathroom floor doing her cocaine

Like my mother sang to me
One with a good old-fashioned harmony
Play some simple melody

Won't you play me some rag
Just change that classical nag to some sweet beautiful drag
If you will play from a copy of a tune 
That is choppy you'll get all my applause
And that is simply because I wanna listen to rag

Ter loucura por uma mulher
E depois encontrar esse amor, meu senhor
Nos braços de um outro qualquer
Você sabe o que é ter um amor, meu senhor
E por ele quase morrer
E depois encontrá-lo em um braço
Que nem um pedaço do seu pode ser

Há pessoas de nervos de aço
Sem sangue nas veias e sem coração
Mas não sei se passando o que eu passo
Talvez não lhe venha qualquer reação

É ciúme, despeito, amizade ou horror

Me dá um desejo de morte ou de dor",Nervos de Aço,1999

Na boca do vento

E o vento vadio embalando a flor

In her site, what you doin' with someone like me, surely one
Of lifes mystery.

I ever win your love, what did I do, what did I say, to turn your angel eyes
My way.

Well I'm a girl who never learned to dance, never even got one
Second glance, across a crowded room was close enough, I could
Look but I could never touch.

So tonight, I'll ask the stars above, how did
I ever win your love, what did I do, what did I say, to turn your angel eyes
My way.

Don't let me wake, don't let anyone wake me if its just a dream, cause
It's the best thing that's ever happened to me, oh you ladies, you can look all you like

'Cause I'm still I love with you
I spend each day here waiting for a miracle
But it's just you and me going through the mill climbing up a hill

This is the long goodbye
Somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kind of love keeps breaking a heart
No matter how hard I try
You're gonna make me cry
Come on baby it's over let's face it
All that's happening here is a long goodbye

Sometimes I ask my heart did we really give our love a chance
I know without a doubt
That we turned it inside out
And if we walked away it would make more sense
But it tears me up inside

How long must we keep running on this carousel
Going round and round and never getting anywhere on a wing and prayer

This is the long goodbye
Somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kind of love keeps breaking a heart
No matter how hard I try
You're gonna make me cry
Come on baby it's over let's face it
All that's happening here is a long goodbye

Paulino Monroy,"¿Qué será? Que esa noche
Ya estaba ilusionada por venir a mi casa
Y de un vino a una balada
Un beso click, toco mi alma
Desde el suelo hasta mi cama
Dibujo el amor

Con alas, sus alas, mis alas

Y ¿que pasó? Al otro día
Llega vida, poseída, por su vida, por su voz, por su risa
Yo que nunca llevo prisa
Me calme mas cada día
Crece el mar y la manía
Por ver en su luz, infinita luz

¿Que será? que la miro y del mundo material
Así me olvido
Conexión espiritual
Tiene conmigo oh oh oh oh oh
Ella, conexión espiritual tiene conmigo

Hoy ya es y ella sabe
Eso explica todo el místico fulgor
Ni duda cabe la confianza mágica
La solución de las señales
Todas estas cosas bellas
Consecuencias son

Con alas, sus alas, mis alas

¿Qué pasará? Nadie lo sabe
Solo se que de decirlo
No sera algo que acabe
Con el místico fulgor de nuestra acción
La vida es clave
Y en un lapso de su historia
Un día nos junto, en infinita luz

¿Que será? Que la miro y del mundo material
Así me olvido
Conexión espiritual
Tiene conmigo oh oh oh oh oh

Ella, conexión espiritual tiene conmigo
Oh oh oh oh oh
Ella, conexión espiritual tiene conmigo

En el fil de la manga
Quiero paz
En un surco de mi alma
Quiero tu sonrisa congelada

Quiero el tren de la vida que se escapa
Quiero fe, quiero ser el sueño que te atrapa
Que mi huella no borres del mapa

Paulino Monroy,"Yo lo único que quise fue guardarte un lugar
Junto con todos mis sueños en el centro del corazón

Tú lo único que hiciste fue tratar de escapar
Y con ello arrancar todo lo bello 
De esta historia todo lo especial
Todo lo que no todo suele pasar
Todo lo mágico, tú lo quisite borrar

Y me dijiste una estúpida excusa que me hizo llorar
Una frase trillada que no quiero ni recordar
Escogiste al tiempo de pretexto
Pero recuerda que el tiempo es oro 
No se te vaya a terminar conmigo
Porque tu me conoces bien, sabes que muy muy bien
Sigo siendo el terco que en vez de dormir
Se puso a escribir esta canción
Pensando en ti, y yo te conozco bien
Sabes que muy muy bien
Está bien ser sincera, pero no está bien
No, olvidarse de

Que tú y yo y la música, las tardes que 
Se convertían en noches con solo charlar
Acuérdate cuando no importaba 
Nada más que tú y yo y la eternidad
Las vacas y la casualidad, la luna y la estrella
La necesidad de juntos escapar

Y tú y yo y la causalidad, los mejores 
Conciertos y sin escuchar, los pasteles feos
Los besos largos que parecían cortos en realidad

Tú y yo y las ganas de amar
La funda que hoy cubre mi almohada
Los dulces raros, las fotos y los recados
Las flores que no sé si un día cambien de color

Y tú y yo y la improvisación
La imprudencia y una canción o dos o tres
Perdí la cuenta, tú date cuenta que yo solo quise, quererte",Las vacas,2015

Cidade a ponto-luz bordada
Toalha á beira-mar estendida

Quando um pombo te olha, sorri, és mulher da rua

Ponho um fado que soube inventar
Aguardente de vida e medronho, que me faz cantar

Paulo Gonzo,"Quando amanheces,logo no ar,
Se agita a luz sem querer,
E mesmo dia,vem devagar,
Para te ver.

E já rendido,vê-te chegar,
Desse outro mundo só teu,
Onde eu queria, entrar um dia,

Pra me perder.
Pra me perder, nesses recantos
Onde tu andas, sozinha sem mim,
Ardo em ciùme desse jardim,
Onde só vai quem tu quiseres,
Onde és senhora do tempo sem fim,
Por minha cruz, jóia de luz,
Entre as mulheres.

Quebra-se o tempo, em teu olhar,
Nesse gesto sem pudor,
Rasga-se o céu, e lá vou eu,
Pra me perder.

Pra me perder, nesses recantos
Onde tu andas sozinha sem mim,
Ardo em cíume desse jardim
Onde só vai quem tu quiseres
Onde és senhora do tempo sem fim,
Por minha cruz, jóia de luz

Pra me perder, nesses recantos
Onde tu andas sozinha sem mim,

Paulo Gonzo,"Foste entrando sem pedires
E marcaste os teus sinais
Tatuaste a minha vida
Ferro e fogo e muito mais
Vasculhaste os meus segredos e eu deixei
Sem reservas nem pudor

Invadiste os meus sentidos
O que não fiz por amor
E deixaste a minha vida bem perdida
Neste beco sem saída

Dei-te quase tudo
E quase tudo foi demais
Dei-te quase tudo
Leva agora os teus sinais
Dei-te quase tudo
E quase tudo foi demais
Dei-te quase tudo
Leva agora os teus sinais

Obrigaste-me a quebrar todas as leis
E deixaste-me ao sabor da loucura
Dei-te os dedos e os anéis
E o que tinha de melhor

Dei-te quase tudo
E quase tudo foi demais
Dei-te quase tudo
Leva agora os teus sinais
Dei-te quase tudo

Paulo Gonzo,"Teimoso subi
Ao cimo de mim
E no alto rasguei
As voltas que dei

Sombra de mil sóis em glória
Cobrem todo o vale ao fundo
Dorme meu pequeno mundo

Como um barco vazio
Pelas margens do rio
Desce o denso véu lilás
Desce em silêncio e paz
Manso e macio

Deixa que te leve
Assim tão leve
Leve e que te beije meu anjo triste
Deixo-te o meu canto canção tão breve
Brando como tu amor pediste

Não fales, calei
E assim fiquei
Sombra de mil sóis cansados
Crescendo como dedos finos
A embalar nossos destinos

Deixa que te leve
Assim tão leve
Leve e que te beije meu anjo triste
Deixo-te o meu canto canção tão breve
Brando como tu amor pediste

Deixa que te leve

Paulo Jobim,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2005

Eu tava preparado
Descobri mil maneiras de dizer o leu nome
Com amor, ódio, urgência
Ou como se não fosse nada
No beco escuro explode a violência
Eu tava acordado

Paixão, insônia, doença
Liberdade vigiada
No beco escuro explode a violência
No meio da madrugada
Com amor, mm ódio, urgência

Paulson,"I'm making you more then a friend. 
So I'm sorry if you're my experiment. 
But the blonde in your hair is not real, 
And how's that supposed to make me feel?

And I'm afraid to win it. 
So although I'll try, 
I'll in the end still come up just shy. 
And I'm afraid to be it. 
So I swear I'll try, 
But you know I just can't help it.

So this is the way I deal. 
The ice is replaced with the sentiment that comfort is achieved in pairs. 
Maybe that's why I'm glad you're here.

What other kind of love is there? 
Is there anything that could be stopping me? 
What other kind of love is there? 
Is it possible to not be property?",Just Shy,2005
Paulson,"I've been here before, the sky looks so familiar.
Empty pockets just like last time,
Salt and lust my backseat driver.

I knew you when.

I can hear my pulse behind my ears and my throat,
Salt and lust my backseat driver.

I knew you when.",I Knew You When,2005
Paulson,"Home again and you're remembering when you were young
Thoughts that come to you surrounded by your flesh and blood.
You were blown away cause they made the trade, made it anyway. You're in a rush to grow, when you got engaged, it was a Saturday.

Take your time, let it float away.
Let the current bring you back to me.

Recordings of your voice and notes are buried underground.
Something in the way she spoke that made you turn around.
Now you're open wide, she's got you off the road, but she's gonna get you home.
You gotta let it go, she's got you under the gun, back to square one.",Miami Current,2005
Paulson,"Get a pen, make a list of your crimes and then hand it over.
Who says you can't switch sides? It's that simple.
And you can't make mistakes, but as men we are able to folly.
You say that's just fine. That makes no sense.

They'll throw that book at us,
And they're aiming for our young but they'll miss by a long shot.
Yeah not by a long shot
Will we join them?

Cause you're old and you're scared,
It's the luxury of youth that allows us to see a different side.
Do you remember?
A sudden surge of the tide,
Saw it wash away life I say that we can prevent this.
You say it's a sign. Aren't you lucky?",Not by a Long Shot,2005
Paulson,"Broke and drunk on lemonade; her idea to go away.
When-when they-they arrive dress-dressed in pride,
They'll wash them down in flashing lights.

Weight escapes in stereo, soldiers cracking random codes.
He'll find he's so lost-lost
And in her eyes, won't-won't let-let him compromise.
Dance all night.

Coming just to get along, smiling but the love is gone.
She-she fi-finally gets her balance back,
She-she swear-swears it was an act,
Of all ways it could've gone, cake and white and carry-ons,
She'll put an end to this, this 4-year stand
'cause she can't love a violent man.

Dance all night.
It's in her kiss, you won't admit it.
I know that after this we'll never dance again,
So dance all night.

When I took your hand, did I misunderstand?
The plates began to slip away and matching edges start to scrape.
The floors collapse from underneath and plaster walls evaporate.
The programs run and take away the center of our gravity;
The bonds we made were never meant to break.",Programs,2005
Paulson,"I hear you went away
You had to leave this state
It seems your past was catching up to you in this place
I've been alone in hearing you
That's when the call comes through

You don't want me
You're just lonely
And I let you inside
You don't want me
You're just lonely
And I don't care tonight

I'm listed day to day
I lost my sense of taste
And I can't seem to get my head on straight
And I know we all make mistakes
Mine cause too much pain

You don't want me
You're just lonely
And I let you inside
You don't want me
You're just lonely

I'm lost by the wayside, but I made it in your diary.

I'm gonna need you, need you sometime

I know I'm a disappointment and I've lost all your sympathy.
And you say...
I'm gonna want you, want you.
I'm gonna need you, need you sometime.

Now I've got voids to fill.

Is what we need what I want to know?
Chances are the catacombs are not as dark
Still I want to know if we're armed to the teeth with grades that won't stop rising

We joined the hearts running from the start
A blinking light was on
We built the blocks running from the start

The ancient fade from white to cream, and cream to spoil
Still I want to know if we're so armed and filled with destiny, why's it feel so wrong?

It's an inch, it's a lift, it's just the way it is.
I should've chained the doors to save us from the walk-ins.
Now it's too late to turn the lights off and hide.

Last night you were next to me when the fire alarm went off.
We held each other on the feather bed quiet and calm.
But it was not the same, the names were changed,
And the window frames were in the wrong place
In my dreams where I didn't mess everything up. 

I imagined a son and this not my imagination.
Honey, you're too sweet for my teeth and you're giving me cavities.
If you never run too fast, you'll never get winded.
No relationships are ever finished, just abandoned.

In this light, you're a silhouette and I'm gauged by what I'm told.
All I can see were the seventeen inches of snow.
It was not the same, the names were changed
And the window frames were in the wrong place
In my dreams where I didn't mess everything up.

I called ahead; no one answered cause no one's there.
I'm fine, just tired, and hiding from things I can't explain.

Knowing it's our nature to try, we're fighting off this ultra-high.

It should be cold, it's the clouds that keep us warm.

To get off the wall and get the bar room shakin
I came to but the party under a rest

Pauly Yamz,"I got love for the game that's why I'm rhyming always stay in the booth
Never lying to the people always telling the truth
I feel the bass in my chest give power to songs
Girl ripping when I'm home about the hours I'm gone
I can't help it the studio where Paul be at
Tried to walk away from it but it called me back
Forget my pride shit I even quit my job
For the one that I love to work music
Recognized by my art that I spill in my game
Pour my heart on the track and have you feeling my pain
Seen a lot of hard times on the way to success
When I'm mad writing a rhyme is my way to express
Lay back and fall deep in a verse
If I was out in the street yo I probably lay a sleep in a hearse
There's nothing like when you on a mic tearing a track
Then you come from out the booth and start hearing it back
Everybody their love the sound that's why they give you hugs and pounds
Now you know you was spittin it
You got the whole run vibing the same
You ain't doing this for dollars and chains
You got love for the game

Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)

Only deal in dollars and change
Switch places for big faces one and the same
With Snares and kicks prepared to mix
In the booth till I'm dead
No roof on my head
Keep the tools in the shed
Got a place to lay
But a place to stay
That's what I deal with on a day to day
Phone off heat off loan shark spaghetti no meat balls
At least y'all can eat y'all can feel my pain
When a cloudy day feel my rain
No food no drink just hunger pains
Thinkin of that day who this chrome gonna kill
Smiling women face for a home cooked meal
Right now I hate my life
But love the way I write
For real I think I seen my death
Think I like bumming g's from Jeff
Pockets on my cheese on e and they seems on f
I'm a hard working all nighter ass cat see sack song writer worldwide doom ball rider
Feel my blood and tears but the love for the drug got me loved and revered
From these thugs for years

Yo black it seem like we both feeling the same
Remember when I walked away and you were still in the game
(Uh ha)
That shit was hot I'm still feeling the flame
Plus you never forgot every other verse spilling my name
Chilling with dames to will they range killin their brain with game
If not cousin I be still on the train
Like you said we ain't willing to change
I'm feeling you making
Damn see family and we
Stick together
Shows overseas spit together
No doubt for the love of the game
We gonna keep staying the same
When you not around laying your dame
Getting paper from a play in a lane
Keep heat for any hater wanna test the rap
And even more on the wax so sat Jeff is phat

I attest to that
Still walk with dress room back
Same ghetto
Same whip
Still stressed on whack
Just wanna back y'all nothin less than that
Just want some cash cars and them records with black
It's just a game yo
But whether or not
I still got love for hip hop
It's the game

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

It's what I want (it's what I want)
I see you beg like a little dog (ball and twine)
Don't you know that it's what I want? (it's what I want)
I'll see you beg, and it makes you dry
Make me dry, make me dry, make me dry

I've been down, the King of Id's
Id's all we have, I've been down
And I could wait to hear the words
They're diamond-sharp today
