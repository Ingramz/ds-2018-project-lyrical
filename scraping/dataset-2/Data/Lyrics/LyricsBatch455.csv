Anne Murray,"There's a wren in a willow wood
Flys so high and sings so good
And he brings to you, what he sings to you
Like my brother the wren and I
Well, he told if I try, I could fly for you
And I want to try for you, 'cause

I want to sing you a love song
I want to rock you in my arms all night long
I want to get to know you
I want to show you, the peaceful feelin' of my home

Summer thunder on moon-bright days
Northern Lights and skies ablaze
And I bring to you, lover, when I sing to you
Silver wings in a fiery sky
Show the trail of my love and I
Sing to you, love is what I bring to you
And I want to sing to you, oh

I want to sing you a love song
I want to rock you in my arms all night long
I want to get to know you
I want to show you, the peaceful feelin' of my home

Brief interlude

I want to sing you a love song
I want to rock you in my arms all night long
I want to get to know you
I want to show you, the peaceful feelin' of my home
I want to show you, the peaceful feelin' of my home",Love Song,1974
Anne Murray,"If I could be any tree in the ground
I'd wanna be a tree where the birds hang around
'Cause everybody needs to be loved
And I'm no exception, I was born to reject rejection

If only for today
Send a little love my way

Every day begins with hope
No one ever need despair
Hand in hand, we all can cope each of us
Alone is only half a pair, we've got to share

If I could be any star up above
I'd wanna be a star people wish on for love
'Cause everybody needs to be loved
And I'm no exception, I was born to reject rejection

If only for today
Show me that you want me
Show me that you need me
Send a little love my way

If I could be any star up above
I'd wanna be a star people wish on for love
'Cause everybody needs to be loved
And I'm no exception, I was born to reject rejection

If only for today
Show me that you want me
Show me that you need me
Send a little love my way",Send Little Love My Way,1974
Anne Murray,"And his love will be his vision,
And he'll take you where you stand.
And will you stand your life by his,
And help the boy become a man? 

Will he be the son of his father?
His father, the teacher?
Teachin' love and honesty,
An' bein' his own manhandler.
Or the son of,
The son of a run of the mill,
Run rotten gambler?

Will the devil be getting to you,
As you look back over what you've done?
And what you've done: was it for reason or for rhyme?
Was it just for fun?

Will he be the son of his father?
His father, the teacher?
Teachin' love and honesty,
An' bein' his own manhandler.
Or the son of,
The son of a run of the mill,
Run rotten gambler?

Back on the road now, you can lose your head.
There ain't no kingdom for the gamblin' man.
You know the road now and you've made your stand.
When his eyes shine upon you, shine upon you.

Will he be the son of his father?

Anne Murray,"If you've been thinking you're all that you've got
Then don't feel alone anymore
'Cause when we're together then you've got alot
'Cause I am the river and you are the shore.

And it goes on and on, watching the river run
Further and further from things that we've done
Leaving them one by one
And we have just begun, watching the river run
Listening and learning and yearning, to run river run.

Winding and swirling and dancing along
We pass by the old willow tree
Where lovers caress as they sing our song
Twisting together when we greet the sea.

And it goes on and on, watching the river run
Further and further from things that we've done
Leaving them one by one
And we have just begun, watching the river run
Listening and learning and yearning, run river run

Run river, run
Run river, run",Watching the River Run,1974
Anne Murray,"Every night I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms
'Cause I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover, where are you
With a love, oh, so true
And the hand that I can hold
To feel you near as I grow old
'Cause I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Someday, I don't know how
I hope she'll hear my plea
Some way, I don't know how
She'll bring her love to me

Dream lover, until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Till all my lover's dreams come true
'Cause I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover, until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Till all my lover's dreams come true
'Cause I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Please don't make me dream alone
I beg you don't make me dream alone
No, I don't wanna dream",Dream Lover,1975
Anne Murray,"I've never held love so closely
Never knew one touch so well
I never dreamed love could really
Bring me to heaven from hell
I've run miles in the rain
Faced the nights with no end
I finally found my way through
Fate has been cheated
All that I needed
Was just to feel this love from you
Just to feel this love from you

I've never seen life so clearly
Never fear one step I take
My dreams live on past the morning
Oh what a difference you make
I'm sure God only knows
Where I'd be without you
I finally found my way through
Fate has been cheated
All that I needed
Was just to feel this love from you

It's been hard to believe
Love was in reach
Forevers fell before
Each other's needs
God only knows where I'd be without you
I finally found my way through
Fate has been cheated
All that I needed
Was just to feel this love from you
Just to feel this love from you",Just to Feel This Love from You,1975
Anne Murray,"I've been looking at people
And how they change with the times
And lately all I've been seeing are people
Throwing love away and losing their minds

Or maybe it's me that's gone crazy
'Cause I can't understand why
All these people keep hurting each other
When good love is so hard to come by

So what's the glory in living
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for

I've been listening to people
And they say love is the key
It's not my way to let them lead me astray
It's only that I want to believe

But I see love-hungry people
Trying their best to survive
While in their hands is a dying romance
And they're not even trying to keep it alive

So what's the glory in living
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for",What's Forever For,1975
Anne Murray,"It's a long distance phone
And I feel so alone
Here without him.

Its a crime and a shame
That I ain't got the change
And don't you know that
I`m worried about him.

I've been all over street
Every street, up and down
Looking for the man.

It's just a face in the crowd
Where the traffic roars loud
But don't you know he'd be
Proud to give a helping hand.

Mister, can you
Fnd it in your heart
To lend me a dollar
For the times have been slow
I'm fresh outta dough
And I ain't got the
Money to call him.

I threw my pride out the door
'Cause I've been turned down before
But I'll keep trying.

This kind of pain is
Kind of hard to explain
But the feeling's the same
As like dying.

Mister, can you
Find it in your heart
To lend me a dollar
For the times have been slow
I'm fresh outta dough
And I ain't got the
Money to call him.

You put the change in my hand
You're the world's kindest man
And I thank you, Sir.

You'll never know what you've done
For this poor mother's son
A thirsty man just got a
Cold cup of water.

Mister, can you
Find it in your heart
To lend me a dollar
For the times have been slow
I'm fresh outta dough
And I ain't got the
Money to call him.

Anne Murray,"When trumpets were mellow
And every gal only had one fellow
No need to remember when
'Cause everything old is new again.

Dancin' at church, Long Island jazzy parties
Waiter bring us some more Bacardi
We'll order now what they ordered then
'Cause everything old is new agian.

Get out your white suit, your top hat and tails
Let's go backwards when forward fails
And movie stars you thought were long dead
Now framed beside your bed.

Don't throw the past away
You might need it some rainy day
Dreams can come true again
When everything old is new again.

Get out your white suit, your top hat and tails
Put it on backwards when forward fails
Leave Greta Garbo alone
Be a movie star on your own.

And don't throw the past away
You might need it some rainy day
Dreams can come true again
When everything old is new again.

When everything old is new again.",Everything Old Is New Again,1975
Anne Murray,"It's such a beautiful day that the sky seems to say good morning
Mister dust off your shoes throw away all your blues and start smiling
Take a good look around there's no clouds looking down upon your way
So won't you decide to come back alive, it's a new day.

Sunday sunrise shining through my window pane
Chasing away my cares with all the pouring rain
Sunday sunrise unfolding like a smile
Making me feel like a new born baby child.

Well, I'm feeling so good I keep knocking on wood I'm no dreaming
I hear birds everywhere singing songs in the air with a meaning
Saying it's time to wake up get a whole new outlook from your view
Come on out where it's warm it don't do any harm if you want to.

Sunday sunrise shining through my window pane
Chasing away my cares with all the pouring rain
Sunday sunrise unfolding like a smile
Making me feel like a new born baby child.

Anne Murray,"Got dust on my piano
And dishes in the sink
Your side of the bed is cold
I haven't slept a wink
So I read your goodbye letter
To the face inside my drink
Lay me down and roll me out to sea

Got your picture in my wallet
And some pictures in my mind
A pocketful of memories
I never thought I'd find
And it's rainin' like a Monday
And the world seems so unkind
So lay me down and roll me out to sea

[Chorus]
Lay me down, roll me out to sea
Calling on a mighty wave to cover me
Lay me down
Roll me out to sea
Heaven, if you're ready shine your light on me

Now listen to my story
Cause I haven't told it all
I saw her with her new love
She turned to me and called
When they asked, ""How ya' doing?""
I could crumbled like a wall
So lay me down and roll me out to sea

[Chorus]",Lay Me Down,1976
Anne Murray,"Every now and then I cry
Every night you keep stayin' on my mind
All my friends say I'll survive
It just takes time

But I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again
No I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No I don't see how it can while we are still apart
And when you hear this song
I hope that you will see
That time won't heal a broken-hearted me

Every day is just the same
Playin' games, different lovers, different names
They keep sayin' I'll survive
It just takes time

But I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again
No I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No I don't see how it can while we are still apart
And when you hear this song
I hope that you will see
That time won't heal a broken-hearted me

Time won't heal a broken-hearted me",Broken Hearted Me,1978
Anne Murray,"Oh I could hide 'neath the wings
Of the blue bird as she sings
The six-o'clock alarm would never ring
But six rings and I rise
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes
The shaving razor's cold and it stings

Cheer up sleepy Jean
Oh what can it mean to a
Daydream believer and a
Homecoming queen

You once thought of me
As a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh, our good times start and end
Without all I want to spend
But how much baby do we really need

Cheer up sleepy Jean
Oh what can it mean to a
Daydream believer and a
Homecoming queen",Daydream Believer,1978
Anne Murray,"All the world is a room and the room is painted blue
You look at me, I look at you
And we need our song to pull us through
But the melody is changing
And the words have slipped away
And we cannot sing our good old song
Like we could in the good old days

Leavin' you, it sure ain't easy
I think of the summer nights we knew
I remember the way you used to plea-ease me
But the time is now upon us to go our separate way
Because we cannot sing the good old song
Like we could in the good old days

And don't you want to have your chance
Don't you want to try a new romance
And I know-ow-ow you will (I know you will)
When the time is right
You will dance on the highest hill
In the night

But tonight I want to hold you close
I want to feel you near me one more time
But too bad, so sad, that's how it goes
When your friends all come and ask you
Why your lover went away
Just tell 'em we could not sing the good old song
Like we could in the good old days

Just tell 'em we could not sing the good old song
Like we could in the good old days",Good Old Song,1978
Anne Murray,"Standin' by my window, listenin' for your call
Seems I really miss you after all
Time won't let me keep these sad thoughts to myself
I'd just like to let you know, I wish I'd never let you go and

I'll always love you, deep inside this heart of mine
I do love you

I'll always need you and if you ever change your mind
I'll still, I-I will, love you
Wish you'd never left me but love's a mystery
You can break a heart so easily
The days and the nights reveal how much I feel for you
Time has come for me to see 
How much your love has meant to me

I'll always love you, deep inside this heart of mine
I do love you

I'll always need you and if you ever change your mind
I'll still, I-I will, love you
Time, like a river keeps on rollin' right on by
Seems like nothin's left for me
So I'll just watch the river rise

I'll always love you, and deep inside this heart of mine
I do love you

Anne Murray,"Well, hello my old friend
You know it's sure good to see you again
There's no need to explain where you've been
Just open up the door, come on in

Well, it's been quite a while
But you can still light the room with your smile
No, I won't scold you like a runaway child
Just open up the door, come on in

'Cause you'll never be a stranger at my door
You can't hurt me hard enough
That I don't know you anymore

Anne Murray,"How many times have you let me down
You never stay when you come around
I see no reason why you have to slip away

Come on in while I pour the wine
We'll drink it slow and take our time
No need to hurry

I like the drawn out test to test
I like my feet right on the ground
I take a long time getting on
To matters close at hand
Why don't you stick around?

Why don't you?
Why don't you stick around?

That's when I like to stop and remind you
You've got me to hold on to baby oh you've got me to hold on to

",Hold Me Tight,1978
Anne Murray,"There's no need to lie
Without me half trying, I could love you
It shows in your eyes
That you feel the same way I do
But wherever I go, my conscience goes
What more can I say
It's only desire, not yet a fire
Let's keep it that way

'Cause I don't want to have to tell him a lie
When I get back home
'Cause it would tear apart his fairy tale world
If I did him wrong
And lying to him would hurt me more
Than leaving you this way
So before we forget, we're not cheaters yet
Let's keep it that way

Let's finish this wine
'Cause I'm not thinking too clearly tonight
And the touch of your hand
Makes it so hard for me to tell wrong from right

And though I'd like to stay
Before I give in

And keep it that way",Let's Keep It That Way,1978

When I gave my love to you.
Everything just seems so right,
You are my sunlight, shining through.
And I've tried so, not to let it show,
Yet it seems sad, because I know:

No matter how hard I try,
No matter how hard I try,
It's always a goodbye.

You smile softly as you leave my bed,
And I tightly hold your hand.
You lean down to kiss my head,
But there's nothing to be said.
And if you say you want to stay,
I'd know you'd soon be on your way.

[Chorus x 3]

So here we stand, you and I.

To say what we really mean.
So we make life a masquerade,
Never showing all, only the parts we play.

Is not so bad
Unless you think about
The love that we had
I don't know, who closed the door
But we don't make love anymore

We used to love
You used to care
Now it's hard to find
The feeling we shared
You found a way
To even the score
And we don't make love anymore

So come lie down
Beside me and talk to me
Touch me with your body and your mind
Help me find the feeling
And push all this behind
We'll make sweet, sweet love one more time

But you won't try
And I'll understand
We'll just live our lives
The best we can
We turn out the lights
We still lock the door
But we don't make love anymore

things,
But I know he can't help it too.

In all our trials born to be our friends
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger
Behold your king before him lowly bend

Truly he taught us to love one another
His law is love and his gospel is peace
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease

With all our hearts we praise his holy name

In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I'll fall in love with you

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I fall in love, when I fall in love with you

I remember the snowflakes that fell from the sky
And covered the village that lay sleeping below
Thank goodness this season will never grow old

I look through my window well into the night
Watching and waiting and hoping I might
See one little reindeer fly through the snow
Thank goodness this season will never grow old

Christmas is coming, may joy fill your home
And the spirit be with you wherever you go
Christmas is coming, may joy fill your home
And the spirit be with you wherever you go

Trees with full branches were the first ones to go
I remember the children who came to the door
And sang out the carols we all used to know
Thank goodness this season will never grow old

All round the fire, the warmth of the flame
Tip-toeing softly trying not to awake
The ones who lie waiting for good things you know
Thank goodness this season will never grow old

If you ever change your mind again
I will greet you like a long lost friend

And I never will be over you
I will love you ‘til the end of time

Anne Murray,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you

Darling please tell me something
Won't you make me feel that it's all right

When this trouble passes over
You and I will walk away
Knowing that our love survived
Another test of faith

For tomorrow is so far away
The night you found courage to tell him
That you found out to tell him today

Some strange melody you never knew
And it won't leave your head as you climb into bed
No matter what you do

Of a voice you'd know anywhere?

Oh, I really should have known
By the time you drove me home
By the vagueness in your eyes, your casual good-byes
By the chill in your embrace
The expression on your face, told me
Maybe, you might have some advice to give
How to be insensitive, insensitive ooh, insensitive

How do you numb your skin, after the warmest touch?
How do you slow your blood, after the body rush?
How do you free your soul, after you've found a friend?
How do you teach your heart
It's a crime to fall in love again?

Oh, you probably won't remember me
It's probably ancient history
I'm one of the chosen few
Who went ahead and fell for you
I'm out of vogue, I'm out of touch

Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day

Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again

Oh take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

Then tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plains from field to town
Marchin' to be free
And of the rusted prison gates that tumble by degree
Like laughing children one by one
They look like you and me

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

I know you are no stranger down the crooked rainbow trial
From dancing cliff edge shattered sills to slander shackled jails
Where the voices drift up from below as walls are bein' scaled
Yes all of this and more my friend your song shall not be failed

Oh take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary, from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh, and maybe I can try
Just lookin for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

Though sometimes the map is out of our hands
Every day is a step
Though we may not know the reason just yet

When your dreams sleep
Learn to let go, and just let it be

Let there be light
Let there be hope in the dark of the night
For every heart that's lying in wait

Let the river carry you where it will

Anne Murray,"There was a child named Bernadette
I heard the story, long ago
She saw the queen of heaven once
And kept the vision in her soul.

No one believed what she had seen
No one believed what she's heard
That there were sorrows to be healed
And mercy, mercy in this world.

So many hearts I find. broke like yours and mine
Torn by what we've done and can't undo
I just want to hold you, won't you let me hold you?
Like Bernadette would do.

We've been around, we fall, we fly
We mostly fall, we mostly run
And every now and then, we try
To mend the damage that we've done.

Tonight, tonight I cannot rest
I've got this joy inside breast
To think that I did not forget
That child, that song of Bernadette.

So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine
Torn by what we've done and can't undo

Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
They're really saying I love you.

Breathing a lesson unheard,
Hope with a gentle persuasion
Whispers her comforting word:
Wait till the darkness is over,
Wait till the tempest is done,
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow,
After the shower is gone.

Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice,
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice.

If, in the dusk of the twilight,
Dim be the region afar,
Will not the deepening darkness
Brighten the glimmering star?
Then when the night is upon us,
Why should the heart sink away?
When the dark midnight is over,
Watch for the breaking of day.

Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice,
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice.

Hope, as an anchor so steadfast,
Rends the dark veil for the soul,
Whither the Master has entered,
Robbing the grave of its goal.
Come then, O come, glad fruition,
Come to my sad weary heart,
Come, O Thou blest hope of glory,
Never, O never depart.

Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice",Whispering Hope,1999

And they shake their heads
And they tell me that I've changed

In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.

Born is the King of Israel!

Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.

Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.

Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose

To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Fly away with you

That he'll only break my heart again should I decide to stay

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

I may be right I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole damned world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berekeley square

How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
To those hazy crazy nights we met
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

Ah this heart of mine
Loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
We would dance cheek to cheek
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The dawn came stealing up
All gold and blue
To interrupt our rendez-vous
I still remember how you smiled and said
Was that a dream or was it true?

Our homeward step was just as light
As the dancing feet of astaire
And like an echo far away
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

She has left the Seine

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
I heard the laughter of her heart in every street caf‚

The last time I saw Paris, her trees were dressed for spring,
And lovers walked beneath those trees and birds found songs to sing.

I dodged the same old taxicabs that I had dodged for years.
The chorus of their squeaky horns was music to my ears.

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
No matter how they change her, I'll remember her that way.

I'll think of happy hours, and people who shared them

Darling I remember the way you used to wait.

Time would come for roll call, Time for us to part,
Darling I'd caress you and press you to my heart,
And there 'neath that far off lantern light,
I'd hold you tight, We'd kiss good-night,

All confined to barracks was more than I could bear;

And as I sit here in the comfort of my cozy chair 
My fancy takes me to a humble eastside tenement

I sailed from out of Cork
A wanderer from Erin's isle
I landed in New York

And riches came galore
And now that I'm going back again

And greet me with a smile

And kiss the colleens all

They'll come from near and far
They'll line the roads for miles and miles
With Irish jauntin' cars
The spirits'll flow and we'll be gay
We'll fill your hearts with joy
The piper'll play an Irish reel
To greet the Yankee boy
We'll dance and sing the whole night long
Such fun as never seen
The lads'll be decked in corduroy
The colleens wearin' green
There'll be thousands there that I never saw

Anne Shelton,"If you ever go across the sea to Ireland
Then maybe at the closing of your day
You will sit and watch the moon rise over Claddagh
And watch the barefoot gossoons at their play

Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream
The women in the meadows making hay
And to sit beside a turf fire in the cabin
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay

For the breezes blowing over the seas from Ireland
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow
And the women in the uplands diggin' prates
Speak a language that the strangers do not know

For the strangers came and tried to teach us their way
They scorned us just for being what we are
But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams
Or light a penny candle from a star

And if there is going to be a life hereafter
And faith I am sure there's going to be
I will ask my God to let me make my heaven
In that dear land across the Irish sea",Galway Bay,2012
Anne Shelton,"The pale moon was rising above the green mountain,
The sun was declining beneath the blue sea,
When I strayed with my love to the pure crystal fountain,
That stands in the beautiful vale of Tralee.

She was lovely and fair, as the rose of the summer,
Yet t'was not her beauty alone that won me.
Oh no, t'was the truth in her eyes ever dawning,
That made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee!
The cool shades of evening their mantle were spreading,
And Mary, all smiling, was listening to me,
The moon through the valley her pale rays was shedding,
When I won the heart of the Rose of Tralee.

Anne Shelton,"There's a tear in your eye
And I'm wondering why
For it never should be there at all
With such pow'r in your smile
Sure a stone you'd beguile
So there's never a teardrop should fall

When your sweet lilting laughter's
Like some fairy song
And your eyes twinkle bright as can be
You should laugh all the while
And all other times smile
And now, smile a smile for me

When Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, 'tis like the morn in Spring
In the lilt of Irish laughter
You can hear the angels sing
When Irish hearts are happy
All the world seems bright and gay
And when Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, they steal your heart away

For your smile is a part
Of the love in your heart
And it makes even sunshine more bright
Like the linnet's sweet song
Crooning all the day long
Comes your laughter and light

For the springtime of life
Is the sweetest of all
There is ne'er a real care or regret
And while springtime is ours
Throughout all of youth's hours
Let us smile each chance we get

Do what we can if we're gonna stay

Do you trip on the city's golden gutters and kerbs? 
As the seasons grow wild and the ground undisturbed.

Is less than you've been; 
As the red earth lies under a covering of green.

Are your pockets picked clean?

And it's much as predicted, 
They go down that same track.

Frost reflecting on the glass and in the air outside, 
Fond relations mouthing words of love and tragedy. 
Though it's cold there's vapour rising from a moving stream. 

In a narrow, shallow bed of fine linen and starch, 
Where her long hair tumbled once upon her graceful arch, 
Lace hung on the counters and the walnut cabinets, 
Teeth ware chattering like schoolgirls clicking castanets. 

There will be no light to guide as you ascend the stairs. 
There may be a candle as you kneel and say your prayers. 
Throw the window wide and open, keep this mark from me,

In the gloom 
Like an angel passing through my room 

Half awake and half in dreams 
Seeing long forgotten scenes 
So the present runs into the past 
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind 
Like the embers as they die 
Love was one prolonged good-bye 
And it all comes back to me tonight

Though these days I tend to hurry by.
How pale the rose of my complexion,
How strange the knowing look that's in my eye.
But when the springtime was ablaze,
You took my hand, you held my gaze.

There is no wonder there,
I learned my lesson well,
No need to wonder where that girl has gone.

There is a secret no one knows,
I set my face, I changed my clothes

I dreamed I stood as you were passing,
Just as the horse-drawn carriage sped away.
Of petticoats in puddles dragging,
And my highbutton boots were splashed with clay.

But when the summer was in flame,
You broke your word, denied my name.

There is no wonder there, etc.

But as the winter drags along,
It blurs your sense of right and wrong.

There is no wonder there, etc.

There are never toys thats scattered everywhere

Hell find her waiting like a lonesome queen

Schoolchildren chant and spin.

Like cruel secrets some of us turn out to be. 
Should our love increase, 
We are all released like statues from marble. 
While in a prison yard,

A length of rope.

Does it feel the same when she calls your name.

Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me  

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man
In some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way, into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day  

Where I'm one with every grand illusion

What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me",Thank You For the Music,2014
Anne Sofie von Otter,"Here's to us, one more toast and then we'll pay the bill
Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill
Birds of passage, you and me, we fly instinctively
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex
We're still strivin' for the sky, no taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

It's so strange when you're down and lyin' on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed with nothin' left untried
Standin' calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done

Anne Wilson,"It was a rainy night when he came into sight
Standing by the road, no umbrella, no coat
So I pulled up along side and I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile so we drove for a while
I didn't ask him his name, this lonely boy in the rain
Fate tell me it's right, is this love at first sight
Please don't make it wrong, just stay for the night
All I want to do is make love to you
Say you will you want me too
All I want to do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to

So we found this hotel, it was a place I knew well
We made magic that night. Oh, he did everything right
He brought the woman out of me, so many times, easily
And in the morning when he woke all I left him was a note
I told him I am the flower you are the seed
We walked in the garden we planted a tree
Don't try to find me, please don't you dare
Just live in my memory, you'll always be there

All I want to do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All want to do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to

Oh, oooh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day, we came round the same way
You can imagine his surprise when he saw his own eyes
I said please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me
was the one little thing that you can

All I want to do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I want to do is make love to you
Come on, say you will, you want me too

Songs with all our childhood friends
Oh, now

Oops I got ninety-nine problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love, love, love",2002,2018

Ich schau mich nur um
Schau mich nur mal um
 
Es beschleicht mich wieder das Gefühl
Fragt mich leise was ich wirklich will
Und dann schickt es mich in den April und sagt ha’m wir nicht da!
Das Gefühl ist wie der letze Schrei
Kaum verschwindet es und geht vorbei
Dann verlacht man es und denkt dabei „ach wie dumm ich doch war“

Ewigkeiten kommen und gehen
Hab sie mehr als einmal anprobiert
 
Hier zu eng, da zu streng
Irgendwo kneift es mich
Zu skurril, nicht mein Stil
Das Gefühl steht mir nicht
Ich schau mich nur um
Schau mich nur mal um
 
Das Gefühl ist aus der Kiste raus
Und es zieht mir schon die Schuhe aus
Doch das Leben ist kein Warenhaus denn es nimmt nichts zurück

Ich lernte Lesen, Schreiben, Rechnen, nur das Wesentliche nicht
Ich lernte alle alten Normen, doch nicht, wie man sie zerbricht

Und ich begann zu suchen nach dem großen Ziel, das jeder braucht
Nur meine Zeit, die fand ich nie
Ist sie vertan?
Ist sie verraucht?

Sie in seine Schwingen nähme,

Doch womit die Vögel fliegen,
Das gehört mir nun nicht mehr

Könnt' es sein, dass sie trotz allem noch in meinen Schränken liegt,
Dass sie ständig weiter wüchse und schon viele Jahre wiegt?

Ich muss durch den Monsun, hinter die Welt
Ans ende der Zeit bis kein Regen mehr fällt
Gegen den Sturm, am Abgrund entlang und wenn ich nicht mehr kann denk ich daran
Irgendwann laufen wir zusamm', durch den Monsun
Dann wird alles gut
Ein halber Mond versinkt vor mir
War der eben noch bei dir?
Und hällt er wirklich, was er mir verspricht?
Ich weiß das ich ich dich finden kann
Hör deinen Namen im Orkan, ich glaub noch mehr dran glauben kann ich nicht
Ich muss durch den Monsun hinter die Welt, ans Ende der Zeit bis kein Regen mehr fällt
Gegen den Sturm.
Am Abgrund entlang
Und wenn ich nicht mehr kann, denk ich daran.
Irgendwann laufen wir zusamm', weil uns einfach nichts mehr hallten kann
Durch den Monsun

Hey
Ich kämpf mich durch die Mächte, hinter dieser Tür
Werde sie besiegen und dann, fürn' sie much zu dir

Dann wird alles gut

Will ja gut sein, auch wenn's nicht immer klappt 
Lauf durch die Straßen, verteil Schuhe und Brot 
Mädels und Jungs, das Leben ist kein U-Bahnhof 
Fahr mit nem eigenen Wagen übern CSD 
Schmeiß Gummis in die Menge und schrei ""gay okay""
Mach was du willst auch wenn's keinen bewegt, keiner versteht
Wohn mit ner Blonden und Brünetten in ner Dreier-WG
Seh die ganzen Gängster auf der Suche nach Sinn
Millionen Einzelkämpfer wissen nicht mehr wohin
Am Ende des Tunnels sind alle Lichter gedimmt
Und dreht man wieder auf machen die Lichter uns blind
Unsere Götter sind Freunde, warum sagen sie's uns nicht
Kommt einer vorbei, dann ertragen wir's nicht
Also mach ich mir n schönen Abend, kann nicht schlafen

Wie komm ich da bloß rein?
Oh mein Gott dieser Himmel

Wie komm ich da bloß rein?
Oh mein Gott dieser Himmel

Will da oben rein, wie soll das gehen
Muss ich sein wie Mohammed, Buddha oder Kanye
Kann die Zeichen nicht sehen, kein einziges Gebet
Find keine Ruhe, jeder Beichstuhl belegt
Die Welt zu verändern liegt in meiner Gewalt
Will Frieden verbreiten, hab die Pfeife dabei

Seh die ganzen Emos auf der Suche nach Sinn
Doch ich weiß, ich bin für was gutes bestimmt
In den Goldgräbermienen noch genug für mich drin
Mein neues Haus sieht aus wie der Louvre von innen
Vatikan, Tibet, Mekka, wir feiern's nächste Jahr
Zum Dank schießen wir Silvesterraketen in Arsch

Nothing can stop it cause you've just gotta ride ride ride ride ride

Annette Sanders,"You look at me and wonder, you look at me and doubt,
Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,
'Til birds refuse to sing,

Annette Sanders,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.
Let's never have to share another early autumn.",Early Autumn,2000
Annette Sanders,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,2000

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose

It took a time for me to heal for what
I thought was love
But I was wrong
Blinded by your flashy love
When I was weak
And you were there
Well it was obvious you did not care
About the one
No you don't bother
Well I'm happy without you, honey

Oh yeah they told me
You should be careful what you do
They only use you
For his pleasures and absurd
The love I gave you
It was the last that you deserved
Call us a nice time
To own somebody, that's absurd

Oh
He was my honey
He was my honey
Happy without no honey (Happy without you honey)

I saw you
It was a rainy day in May or June
I couldn't help it
God, you looked so fine
I just had to make you mine, all mine
Well I'm a helpless fool for love

Instantly
I cannot eat nor sleep, no
Hard to breathe
You read my love so easy
A, be, see
Twist my mind around and 1, 2, 3
Then I'm a helpless fool for...

Ah...
When he walks (?)
When he talks
When he moves
Makes my day
I'm the helpless one

Ah...
Not unkind
I don't mind
When he talks
Just a rush
I'm a fool for love

(verse)
All shook up
I know it's stupid to precipitate
Without getting all humiliate
Didn't know what I should say or do
Everything I'll give to you and me (when I'm here without you)
We're gonna have a riot
Trust in me (I can't live without you)
I'm gonna make you happy
What you need (helpless fool without you)
I'll give you everything
I'll try to be (you know, you know, you know, you know, you know)
Still your helpless fool for...

(chorus 2)
Ah...
When he walks
When he talks
When he moves
Makes me feel
I'm a fool for love

Ah...
What a joy, you're my boy
And it seems like a dream
Now I'm all shook up

Ah...
Need you, Doctor Love
Are you there?
Every day I'm the helpless one

Ah...
Not unkind
I don't mind
When he talks
Just a rush
I'm a fool for love

I am a helpless fool for love
I am a helpless fool for love
I am a helpless fool for love

of a girl I used to know

with a new portfolio

feeling good on top of the pops
Can you make it me plus one?
Dress falls down at the aftershow
She breaks down in the video
Think you'll find it's me plus one

Now this wannabe seniorita
met a group of likely girls
Traded posters and the voxpops
for jetting round the world
But it didn't make her happy
and now she flies alone
The wrong pictures in the paper
and no one back at home

Annie Golden,"I met a boy called Frank Mills
On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend, a drummer
He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""
I would gratefully appreciate if you see him tell him
I'm in the park with my girlfriend and please
Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",Frank Mills,2005

I'm just going home
Quiet light, some still day
I'm just going home

Going to fear no more

Mother's there expecting me
Father's waiting, too
Lots of folk gathered there
All the friends I knew

All the friends I knew
I'm going home
Nothing's lost, all's gain
No more fret nor pain
No more stumbling on the way
No more longing for the day
Going to roam no more

Morning star lights the way
Restless dream all done
Shadows gone, break of day
Real life begun

Just a living on
Wide awake with a smile

Close to all your smiles

Living in an empty space
Surrounded by broken lies
How my meaning had been lost
Until I found you in my eyes
How could my spirit
Free itself from doubt
Holding a dream inside
That should be out
Freer than all the streams
That have flowed to the sea

Left for your memories to find

Looking into sleepy eyes
Gazing across my view
Knowing that tomorrow brings
A day containing one less fool

Lying in your love
Carries on living
Now that there's enough
Happiness to be found
Sharing time with our lives

From dull gray to gold
Fly again now

Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
He passed on worried and warning,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night,
Far away on the other side.
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through.
The trees that whisper in the evening,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun,
Far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day.
Four a.m. in the morning,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
I watched your vision forming,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Stars roll slowly in a silvery night,
Far away on the other side.
Will you come to terms with me this night,
But she couldn't find how to push through.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day.
Far away on the other side.
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five.

Could she see him

He would hold her

As a pearl, deep your eyes

If we could see, if only we could see
All the love we lost - carelessly

Why do we take and not return
No going back, you never meet again

That glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold:
""Peace on the earth, good will to men
From heaven's all-gracious King.""

To hear the angels sing!

The world has suffered long
Beneath the angel strain have rolled
Two thousand years of wrong
And man, at war with man, hears not
The love song which they bring:
""O hush the noise, ye men of strife
And hear the angels sing!""

Still through the cloven skies they come
With peaceful wings unfurled
And still their heavenly music floats
Over all the weary world
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing
And ever over its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing

All ye, beneath life's crushing load
Whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow
Look, now, for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing!

For lo! the days are hastening on

Across a moonlit sky
A love flowing endlessly
Soft as a virgin sigh
Can you picture this, a beauty unexplained
All the stories ever told revealing

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]:
After the oceans are gone
What will we do where will we be
Will we carry on in a world without blue
Will you carry on in a world without me
Oooh, Oooh

Bring your out-thereness in here
In here, in here.

Don't be afraid to be yourself
Love and light will wash away your tears
In here

We are all stars in the night
Fish in the mountain stream
No reason to cry
Nothing is as it seems
Can you picture this, a beauty unexplained
All the stories ever told revealing

Annie Haslam's Renaissance,"Every drop of water
Descending like a pearl
Lays upon the silken skin
Of this perfect girl

The breeze around her body
Moved upwards to her face
It held on like a baby
That found its resting place

Voices from the night before
Cannot be denied
Suddenly revealing
All the pain inside
Entering a well of thoughts
All her fears subside
All the bad things turning to
A blessing in disguise

She was the faintest flower
Washed in by the tide
Sending silent messages
To the world outside

Her face began to soften
Her lips took on a smile
The people who had loved her
Came rushing to her side

Voices from the night before
Cannot be disguised

All the pain inside
Entering a well of thoughts
All her fears subside

Could change the river's flow

In another life
In another place
I have held you close
I have known your grace
In another world
In another time
You'll be mine
You'll be mine

If I touched you now
I'd only lose my mind

Annie Haslam's Renaissance,"I thought love so gentle, so pure
I knew love so sweet and so secure
Turning with an open heart
With a touch we would never be apart

So much love just gone slipped away
So much pain to see that love betrays
I will never love again
For love lies, and it will die in the end

If I knew then what I know now
If I had known it all somehow
Always believing love is deceiving
I could have held my shattered dreams
Seen all the things I should have seen
Now I know love lies
Now I know love is bound to die

Flames of love now ash just drifts away
Here I am: I'm lost, and love's astray
I can never love again
For love lied and then it died in the end

[Chorus:]
I thought I saw love in his eyes
But now I know that love just lies
Leaving me hollow, nothing to follow
So I will never give my heart
And I will be a woman apart
Now I know love lies
Now I know love is bound to die

And love was nothing but a need
Devoured by an empty greed
The ashes fill my empty heart
I will always stand apart
This from love's beguiling mask
A kiss, the questions never asked
And now I know that love just lies
I know love is bound to die

[Chorus]","Love Lies, Love Dies",1995

through a crystal ball
there is someone waiting

Life so far hasn't been good
but now you see a face
that shatters pieces of the past
and brings a new found peace

Take his ring of fortune
use it while you can
binding you forever
try to understand him
put the past behind your
let the man come in
don't deny your feelings
he is in your lifeline

Annie Haslam's Renaissance,"We will be a melody so free
A fragrance on the cooling breeze
You to me such gentle poetry
And who would not love days like these?

Hold for us the crystal and the stream
The velvet night our claim for this
We will see with every waking dream
Love smiles and brings the sweetest kiss

And it's true reflections casting shadow to the light
So still, it seems that we are etched in smoke tonight
We will remember this
The sweetest kiss

Should our dreams drift by as time unfolds
Between the sea and sky above
We will stay together, we will hold
The peace and purity of love

I see life and light; it shines from you
A fragrance on the cooling breeze
We will see infinity come through
And who would not love days like these?

And it's true: the music's flowing echoes in the light
Quietly now we are sketched in the mist tonight
We will remember this, we will remember this

And who would not love days like these?",The Sweetest Kiss,1995
Annie Haslam's Renaissance,"Praying for a miracle
Daylight had begun
He saw a woman dancing
Dancing in the sun

Her silhouetted body
A jewel in the sky
Became his only reason
His reason to survive

[Chorus:]
The colours of the casbah
The laughter in the streets
Is this where her flame lives
And what he seeks
Even though he feels it
He knows he's never seen
The flame that's eternal
And never dies - never dies

He'd never known this feeling
A perfect work of art
Passion and the loving
Of a newly opened heart

She became the miracle
As the night drew near
Whispering a love song
That only angels hear

Annie Laurie,"It hurts to be in love, when the only one you love
turns out to be someone who's not in love with you.
It hurts to love her so
when deep down inside you know,
she will never love you, no matter what you do.

And so you cry a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Oh you die a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Day and night, night and day
It hurts to be in love this way.

How long can I exist?
Wanting lips I've never kissed
She gives all her kisses to somebody else.
She thinks I'm just a friend
now it hurts, I must pretend
The only way to keep her, is to keep it to myself.

And so I cry a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Oh I die a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Day and night, night and day
It hurts to be in love this way.

Yes I cry a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Oh I die a little bit (hurts to be in love)

It hurts to be in love this way.

It hurts to be in love, day and night, night and day

Just keep on reaching, though the limb might break

[Chorus]
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate

It's five o'clock in the morning
And you're just getting in
A knock upon the door
A voice sweet and low says
(who is it?)
She opens up the door
And she lets you in
And never once does she say
""where have you been?""

She says,""hold it,
Are you hungry,did you eat yet,
Let me hang up your coat now""
And all the time she's smiling
Never raises her voice
It's five o'clock in the morning
And you don't give it a second thought

[Chorus]

The sweetest woman in the world

Could be the meanest woman in the world
If you make her be that way
She might be holding something in
That's really gonna hurt you
One of these fine days

There you are in the hospital
Bandaged from foot to head
In a state of shock
That much from bein' dead
You didn't think your woman
Could do something like that to you
You didn't think she'd got the nerve
Actions speak louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words,come on

Come on,baby, baby
If you won't give a damn about me
Come on baby, baby
You don't really care about me

By your man
Tell me something
I don't understand

And then you left me
Said you felt trapped

But the heartache's with me till this day

[Chorus]
did you stand by me
No,not at all
Did you stand by me
No way

All the times
That we were closed
I remember
These things the most
I've seen all our dreams
Come tumblin' down
I can't stay happy
Without you around

So alone I keep the wolves a bay
And there's only one thing I can say

[Chorus]

You must explain
Why this must be
Did you lie
When you spoke to me

Did you stand by me
No,not at all

Now I got a job
But it don't pay
I need new clothes
I need somewhere to stay
But without all these things I can do
But without your love I won't make it through
Without you love I won't make it through

But you don't understand my point of view
I suppose there's nothing I can do

Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor

And the room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
But the waiter brought a tray
And so it was later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

You said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
And one of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well be closed
And so it was later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

There's a hole in the sky where the sun don't shine
And a clock on the wall and it counts my time 

Heaven is the home of our hearts 
And heaven don't tear you apart

There's a song on the air with a love-you-line 
And a face in a glass and it looks like mine 
And I'm standing on ice when I say that I don't hear planes 
And I scream at the fools want to jump my train

And weaves a pattern all her own

Walking with grace, so beautifully, carefully 
She's a big and pretty mother, big and pretty mother 
Swinging her hand-bag back and forth so joyfully 
She's drawing circles with her breasts in her jumper 

Give me a big mother 
Huge and loving one
I can crawl upon 
And cling to 

She's a large woman... 
Warm and cuddly...
Wet lady... 
Strong mother...

She's walking down the street in front of my window 
Whistling funky tunes in the ears of my neighbours 

Give me a big mother
One that will always want me
Hot, embracing mother
I can crawl upon
And cling to

Can't be safer, can't be more secure 
Than with a breast in each palm 
Than with a breast in each palm

And that is the way that I want to die

All of your fears will pass away
Safe in my arms

On the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?

Into the world of night
Through shadows falling

Wipe my eyes, dry my tears

Of humanity

The silent stars go by

Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love

O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on earth

How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven

No ear may hear His coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him still
The dear Christ enters in

O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today

We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel",O Little Town of Bethlehem,2010

Hail, thou ever-blessed morn
Hail, redemption's happy dawn
Sing through all Jerusalem

Say, ye holy shepherds, say
What your joyful news today
Wherefore have ye left your sheep
On the lonely mountain steep?

Hail, thou ever-blessed morn
Hail, redemption's happy dawn
Sing through all Jerusalem
Christ is born in Bethlehem

What a tender love was thine
Thus to come from highest bliss
Down to such a world as this

I'm gonna give you what it takes, my universal child

I'm gonna wrap my arms around you, my universal child

And when I look into your eyes, so innocent and pure
I see the shadow of the things that you've had to endure
I see the tracks of every tear that ran right down your face
I see the hurt, I see the pain, I see the human race
And I can feel you, you're everywhere, shining like the sun
