Kate Bush,"As the people here grow colder
I turn to my computer
And spend my evenings with it
Like a friend
I was loading a new program
I had ordered from a magazine
Are you lonely, are you lost?
This voice console is a must
I press Execute

Hello, I know that you've been feeling tired
I bring you love and deeper understanding
Hello, I know that you're unhappy
I bring you love and deeper understanding

Well I've never felt such pleasure
Nothing else seemed to matter
I neglected my bodily needs
I did not eat, I did not sleep
The intensity increasing
'Til my family found me and intervened
But I was lonely, I was lost
Without my little black box
I pick up the phone and go Execute

Hello, I know that you've been feeling tired
I bring you love and deeper understanding
Hello, I know that you're unhappy
I bring you love and deeper understanding

I turn to my computer like a friend

I need deeper understanding

Give me deeper understanding",Deeper Understanding,1990
Kate Bush,"Oh, he's a moody old man. 
Song of summer in his hand. 
Ooh, he's a moody old man. 
In, in, in his hand. 
In his hand.

Delius, 
Delius amat. 
Syphilus, 
Deus,
Genius, oh.

To be sung of a summer night on the water. 
Oh, on the water.

""Ta, ta-ta! 
Ta, ta-ta! 
In be, Fenby!""

To be sung of a summer night on the water 
Oh, on the water. 
On the water.",Delius (Song of Summer),1990
Kate Bush,"Emma's come down,
She's stopped the light shining out of
Her eyes.

Emma's been run out on,
She's breaking down in so many places,
Stuck in low gear, because of her fears,
Of the skidding wheels,
(The skid of her wheels she feels).
Skidding wheels,
(The skid of her wheels she feels).
Spinning wheels,
(Wheel-skidding feeling).

[Chorus]
Her heart is there,
But they've greased the road,
Her heart is out there,
But she's no control.

Oh come on, you've got to use your flow,
You know what it's like, and you know
You want to go,
Don't drive too slowly.
Don't put your blues where your shoes
Should be.
Don't push your foot on the heartbreak.

She's losing that inner flame.
It was burning bright but she's losing the
Fight fast,
She's only herself to blame,
Well take of yourself, and remember Georgie,
But she's so ""O.D.'d"" on weeping
She can hardly see,
That she's dropping beads,
(Red, red glass is bleeding)
Dropping beads,
(Red, red glass is bleeding)
Dropping beads,
(Red, red on the parquet).

[Chorus]",Don't Push Your Foot on the Heartbreak,1990
Kate Bush,"Follow the Nile, Deep to much deeper,
The Pyramids sound lonely tonight.

The sands run red, in Lands of the Pharaohs,
Their symmetry gets right inside me.

I cannot stop to comfort them,
I'm busy chasing up my demon,
Oh, I'm in love with Egypt.

My Pussy Queen, knows all my secrets,
I'll never fall in love again.

I drift with Dunes,
I whisper of the tombs,
They offer me Egyptian Delights.

She's got me with that feline 'guise,
Got me in those Desert eyes,
Oh, I'm in love with Egypt.",Egypt,1990
Kate Bush,"You see, I'm all grown-up now
He said
Just put your feet down child
'Cause you're all grown-up now

Just like a photograph I pick you up
Just like a station on the radio
I pick you up
Just like a face in the crowd
I pick you up
Just like a feeling that you're sending out
I pick it up
But I can't let you go
If I let you go
You slip into the fog

This love was big enough for the both of us
This love of yours
Was big enough to be frightened of
It's deep and dark like the water was
The day I learned to swim

He said 
Just put your feet down child
Just put your feet down child
The water is only waist high
I'll let go of you gently
Then you can swim to me

Is this love big enough to watch over me?
Big enough to let go of me?
Without hurting me
Like the day I learned to swim

'Cause you're all grown-up now
Just put your feet down child
The water is only waist high
I'll let go of you gently
Then you can swim to me",The Fog,1990

Kate Bush,"You talked me into the game of chance
It was thirty-nine before the music started
When you walked up to me and you said
Hey, heads we dance
Well I didn't know who were
Until I saw the morning paper

There was a picture of you
A picture of you 'cross the front page
It looked just like you, just like you in every way
But it couldn't be true
It couldn't be true
You stepped out of a stranger

They say that the Devil is a charming man
And just like you I bet he can dance
And he is coming up behind in his long
Tailed black coat dance
All tails in the air
But the penny landed with its head dancing

A picture of you, a picture of you in uniform
Standing with your head held high
Hot down to the floor
But it couldn't be you
It couldn't be you
It's a picture of Hitler

He go do-do-do-do-do
He go do-do-do-do-do
He go do-do-do-do-do
Do you want to dance?
Well, I couldn't see what was to be
So I just stood there laughing

A picture of you, a picture of you in uniform
Standing with your head held high
Hot down to the floor
But it couldn't be you
It couldn't be you
It's a picture of Hitler

Do-do-do-do-do
He go do-do-do-do-do
He go do-do-do-do-do

Kate Bush,"Hello earth
Hello earth

With just one hand held up high
I can blot you out
Out of sight

Peek-a-boo,
Peek-a-boo, little earth
With just my heart and my mind
I can be driving
Driving home
And you asleep
On the seat

I get out of my car
Step into the night
And look up at the sky
And there's something bright
Traveling fast
Look at it go
Look at it go

Hello earth
Hello earth

Watching storms
Start to form
Over America
Can't do anything
Just watch them swing
With the wind out to sea

All you sailors
(Get out of the waves, get out of the water)
All life-savers,
(Get out of the waves, get out of the water)
All you cruisers,
(Get out of the waves, get out of the water)
All you fishermen
Head for home

Go to sleep, little earth
I was there at the birth
Out of the cloudburst
The head of the tempest
Murderer
Murder of calm
Why did I go? 
Why did I go? 

Tiefer, tiefer
Irgendwo in der tiefe
Gibt es ein licht

Go to sleep little earth",Hello Earth,1990
Kate Bush,"I wait at the table, 
And hold hands with weeping strangers 
Wait for you to join the group 

The tambourine jingle-jangles 
The medium roams and rambles 
Not taken in, I break the circle 

I want this man 
To go away now 

With a kiss 
I'd pass the key 
And feel your tongue 
Teasing and receiving. 
With your spit 
Still on my lip 
You hit the water 
Him and I in the room 
To prove you are with us too 

He's using code that only you and I know 
This is no trick of his 
This is your magic 

I'd catch the cues 
Watching you 
Hoping you'd do something wrong 

Everybody thinks you'll never make it 
But every time you escape 

'Rosabel believe, 
Not even eternity 
Can hold Houdini!' 

""Rosabel, believe!"" 

Through the glass 
I'd watch you breathe 
(""Not even eternity"")
Bound and drowned 
And paler than you've ever been 
(""will hold Houdini!"") 

With your life 
The only thing in my mind 
We pull you from the water 

(Houdini!) 

You (""Hou-di-ni"") 
And I and Rosabel believe",Houdini,1990
Kate Bush,"It's been such a long week
So much crying
I no longer see a future
I've been told when I get older 
That I'll understand it all

But I'm not sure if I want to
Running into her arms 
At the school gates
She whispers that I'm a poor kid
And Granny takes me on her knee 
She tells me I'm too sensitive
She makes me sad

She makes me feel like an old man
She makes me feel like an old man 

They took the game right out of it
They took the game right out of it 

When I am a man 
I will be an astronaut
And find Peter Pan

Second star on the right
Straight on 'til morning
Second star on the right 
Straight on 'til morning

Dennis loves to look 
In the mirror
He tells me that he is beautiful
So I look too, and what do I see? 
My eyes are full
But my face is empty

He's got a photo 
Of his hero
He keeps it under his pillow
But I've got a pin-up 
From a newspaper 
Of Peter Pan

I found it in a locket
I hide it in my pocket 

They took the game right out of it
They took the game right out of it 

When I am a man 
I will be an astronaut 
And find Peter Pan

Second star on the right
Straight on 'til morning 
Second star on the right
Straight on 'til morning
Second star on the right

Kate Bush,"In the warm room
Her perfume reaches you.
Eventually you'll fall for her.
Down you'll go
To where the mellow wallows.

In the warm room
She'll touch you with your Mamma's hand.
You'll long to kiss those red lips,
But when you do
It'll feel like kicking a habit.

[Chorus]
She'll tell you that she'll stay,
So you'd better barricade the way out.
She'll tell you she's true.
She'll tell you she loves you.
She's waiting in that warm room.

In the warm room
She prepares to go to bed.
She'll let you watch her undress,
Go places where
Your fingers long to linger.

In the warm room
You'll fall into her like a pillow.
Her thighs are soft as marshmallows.
Say hello
To the soft musk of her hollows.

Kate Bush,"Say good night-night 
I tuck him in tight. 
But things are not right.
What is this? An infant kiss 
That sends my body tingling?
I've never fallen for 
A little boy before. 
No control.

Just a kid and just at school. 
Back home they'd call me dirty. 
His little hand is on my heart. 
He's got me where it hurts me. 
Knock, knock. Who's there in this baby? 

You know how to work me.
All my barriers are going. 
It's starting to show. 
Let go. Let go. Let go.
I cannot sit and let 
Something happen I'll regret. 
Ooh, he scares me!

There's a man behind those eyes. 
I catch him when I'm bending.
Ooh, how he frightens me 
When they whisper privately. 
(""Don't Let Go!"") 

Windy-wailey blows me.
Words of caress on their lips 
That speak of adult love.
I want to smack but I hold back. 
I only want to touch.

But I must stay and find a way 
To stop before it gets too much!
All my barriers are going.

I know your face well 
I know it well

I'll be sitting in your mirror
Now is the place where the crossroads meet

Never, never say goodbye 
To my part of your life
No, no, no, no, no

Where on your palm is my little line
When you're written in mine 
As an old memory? 

Never, never say goodbye

I put this moment here 
I put this moment
Over here 
Over here 

Can't you see where memories are kept bright? 
Tripping on the water like a laughing girl 
Time in her eyes is spawning past life
One with the ocean and the woman unfurled 
Holding all the love that waits for you here 
Catch us now for I am your future 

A kiss on the wind and we'll make the land 
Come over here to where When lingers
Waiting in this empty world
Waiting for Then, when the lifespray cools 
For Now does ride in on the curl of the wave 
And you will dance with me in the sunlit pools

Kate Bush,"Kashka from Baghdad lives in sin they say
With another man
But no-one knows who
Old friends never call there
Some wonder if life's inside at all
If there's life inside at all
But we know the lady who rents the room
She catches them calling à la lune

[Chorus:]
At night they're seen
Laughing, loving
They know the way
To be happy

They never go for walks
Maybe it's because the moon's not bright enough
There's light in love you see
I watch their shadows
Tall and slim in the window opposite
I long to be with them
'Coz when all the alley-cats come out
You can hear music from Kashka's house

Kate Bush,"With my ego in my gut 
My babbling mouth would wash it up

I keep it shut 

My door was never locked 
Until one day a trigger come, cocking

I keep it shut 

Wide eyes would clean and dust 
Things that decay, things that rust

You cool my brow with your tears. 
Skies of gray are not today.

You said hey wish that was me up there 
It's the biggest rocket I could find
And it's holding the night in its arms
If for only a moment
I can't see the look in its eyes
But I'm sure it must be laughing
But it seemed  to me the saddest thing I'd ever seen
And I thought you were crazy wishing such a thing

I saw only a stick on fire
Alone on its journey
Home to the quickening ground
With no one there to catch it

I put on my pointed hat
And my black and silver suit
And I check my gunpowder pack
And I strap the stick on my back
And dressed as a rocket on Waterloo Bridge
Nobody seemed to see me
Then with the fuse in my hand
And now shooting into the night

And still as a rocket
I land in the river
Was it me said you were crazy?

Size five lightning boots too

There's something very real in how I feel, honey.

It's in me, 
And you know it's for real. 
Tuning in on your saxophone. 

The candle burning over your shoulder is throwing 
Shadows on your saxophone, a surly lady in tremor. 
The stars that climb from her bowels, 
Those stars make towers on vowels.

The color of my room and my mood: 
Blue on the walls, blue out of my mouth; 
The sort of blue between clouds, when the sun comes out, 
The sort of blue in those eyes you get hung up about. 

When that feeling of meaninglessness sets in, 
Go blowing my mind on God: 
The light in the dark, with the neon arms, 
The meek He seeks, the beast He calms, 
The head of the good soul department. 

I see myself suddenly 
On the piano, as a melody. 
My terrible fear of dying 
No longer plays with me, 
for now I know that I'm needed 
For the symphony. 

I associate love with red, 
The colour of my heart when she's dead; 
Red in my mind when the jealousy flies, 
Red in my eyes from emotional ties, 
Manipulation, the danger signs. 

The more I think about sex, the better it gets. 
Here we have a purpose in life: 
Good for the blood circulation, 
Good for releasing the tension, 
The root of our reincarnations.

Written by Donovan Leitch

I fell in love with a swan.
My eyes were filled with feathers,
He filled me with song,
In the reedy river,
In the reedy river.

I in my boat long hours,
He in his royal plumage--
I threw him some flowers,
In the reedy river,
In the reedy river.

Black was the night and starry.
I loosened off my garments
And let forth my hair,*
In the reedy river,
In the reedy river.

Sadly we mourned and sighed,
Whilst in evening twilight
Two swans glide and fly
In the reedy river,
In the reedy river,
(""Two swans glide and fly"")
In the reedy river.
(""Two swans glide and fly"")

I fell in love with a swan...

Kate Bush,"'Tis of a pretty female 
As you may understand
Her mind being bent for rambling 
Unto some foreign land
She dressed herself in sailor's clothes
Or so it does appear
And she hired with a captain 
To serve him for a year
Her cheeks - they were like roses 
And her hair rolled in a curl
The sailors often smiled and said 
He looked just like a girl
But eating of the captain's biscuit 
Her colour did destroy
And the waist did swell of pretty Nell
The handsome cabin boy
'Twas in the bay of Biscay 
Our gallant ship did plow
One night among the sailors 
Was a fearful flurry and row.
They tumbled from their hammocks 
For their sleep it did destroy
And they sworn about the groaning 
Of the handsome cabin boy
""Oh doctor, dear, oh doctor,"" 
The cabin boy did cry
""My time has come, I am undone
And I will surely die."" 
The doctor come a-runnin' 
And a-smilin' at the fun
To think a sailor lad should have 
A daughter or a son
The sailors when they saw the joke 
They all did stand and stare
The child belonged to none of them
They solemnly did swear
The captain's wife, she says to him
""My dear, I wish you joy
For 'tis either you or me's betrayed

Written by Kate Bush

Warm and soothing,
That's how I remember home.
Walking into arms
Through the back door.
Hearing voices I know well,
And long for.

Cold and boozy,
Our holiday in the Alps.
Sitting in the lobby,
Mostly smoking.
Choking on the woozy afternoon.

I'm reeling in the music
And I've only had a few.
And I'm afraid
By the way we grow old,
My darling.

Abrupt, too moody,
You making our party list.
I remember sulking
On the sofa.
For most of the winter
We were strangers.

Just one more
To ease the ache,
Before the night takes me.
When you stay asleep
On your side of the bed,
Don't look at me,
Don't look at you...

I'm reeling in the music
And I've only had a few.
And I'm afraid
By the way we grow old,

On this Midsummer might
Everyone is sleeping
We go driving into the moonlight

Could be in a dream
Our clothes are on the beach
These prints of our feet
Lead right up to the sea
No one, no one is here
No one, no one is here
We stand in the Atlantic
We become panoramic

We tire of the city
We tire of it all
We long for just that something more

We become panoramic

The stars are caught in our hair
The stars are on our fingers
A veil of diamond dust
Just reach up and touch it
The sky's above our heads
The sea's around our legs
In milky, silky water
We swim further and further
We dive down
We dive down

A diamond night, a diamond sea
And a diamond sky

We dive deeper and deeper
We dive deeper and deeper
Could be we are here
Could be we are in a dream

Cold mountain water. Don't ever swim there.
Just stand on the edge and look in there.
And you might see a woman down there.

They say some days, up she comes, up she rises, as if out of nowhere.
Wearing Victorian dress.
She was calling her pet, ""Snowflake! Snowflake!""
Tumbling like a cloud that has drowned in the lake.

Just like a poor, porcelain doll...
Her eyes are open but no-one's home.
The clock has stopped.
So long she's gone.

No-one's home.
Her old dog is sleeping.
His legs are frail now.
But when he dreams,

He runs...
Along long beaches and sticky fields.
Through the Spooky Wood looking for her.
The beds are made. The table is laid.

The door is open - someone is calling: It's a woman.
""Here boy, here boy! You've come home!
I've got an old bone and a biscuit and so much love.
Miss me? Did you miss me?

Here's the kitchen - There's your basket.
Here's the hall - That's where you wait for me.
Here's the bedroom - You're not allowed in there.

He lies down beside me.

So cold next to me.
I can feel him melting in my hand.
Melting, in my hand.
He won't speak to me.

His crooked mouth is full of dead leaves.
Full of dead leaves, bits of twisted branches and frozen garden,
crushed and stolen grasses from slumbering lawn.
He is dissolving, dissolving before me and dawn will come soon.

What kind of spirit is this?
Our one and only tryst.
His breath all misty,
And when I kiss his ice-cream lips

And his creamy skin,
His snowy white arms surround me.

So he sold his part to daddy when grandpa died
And Mom and Dad are old now, they say they're gonna move
Where the weather is always warm and dry

With plans to break ground before the fall

Will you walk with me through the fields of Burley?
I wanna see leaves of gold one more time
You can lay me down beside the ones gone before me
Bury me in bluegrass when I die

And lanterns on the levee will shine for you

There are storms on the horizon that you won't even see
Until the cold relentless winds appear

Kate Campbell,"It sounded like a thousand hooves
Runnin' 'cross the plains
It felt like an earthquake
When I first saw your face

You were standin' like a rock
And suddenly I knew
From that moment on
I belonged to you

Like the sound of distant thunder
Your heart beats next to mine
With love strong enough to stand the test of time
And I will follow you no matter where you roam
I like a man, like a buffalo
I like a man, like a buffalo

Where have all the real men gone?
Did we run 'em off?
In searching for a better way
Did we just get lost?

When I look around these days
I thank the Lord for you
You're a field of open range
And I'm the sky of blue

Like the sound of distant thunder
Your heart beats next to mine
With love strong enough to stand the test of time
And I will follow you no matter where you roam

Kate Campbell,"He built his life with his hands
Put all he had into the land
They came from nowhere on a cold dark wind
The harvest disappeared
But he survived the locust years

It hurt to hear her baby cry
Worked two jobs to get by
Convinced herself she never needed a man
Holding back the tears
She survived the locust years

When I lay next to you in your arms
I know the world can do us no harm
And like the thorns protect the rose
I am safe with you

I know a place inside a dream
Where rivers run through fields of green
A quiet valley that never lives in fear
I will meet you there
If we survive the locust years
If we survive the locust years

Kate Campbell,"No one up here seems to know me
And I don't like the ones that do
Everyone is as cold as the weather
It's time to buy some traveling shoes
I don't need to pack a suitcase
No map to show me where to go
Give me one change of clothes and a box of Oreos
And endless miles of open road

I'm going south of everything
Where the air is sweet and church bells ring
Back where I come from, back where I belong
Down where the sun shines in the rain
And life goes by from a front porch swing
You can keep the bitter cold
I'm gonna go south of everything

Why is everyone in such a hurry?
No one ever wins a rat race
And they wonder why so many go crazy
I gotta get out of this place

When I hear someone ask how I'm doing
Or see a stranger wave behind the wheel
Then I'll know I'm headed in the right direction
By the peaceful way I feel

I'm going south of everything
Where the air is sweet and church bells ring
Back where I come from, back where I belong
Down where the sun shines in the rain
And life goes by from a front porch swing
You can keep the bitter cold
I'm gonna go south of everything

They call it Union Station but it ain't got no tracks
I'm thinkin' 'bout my baby, stuck somewhere up north

This used to be where people stepped aboard a dream
And now, it's just an old hotel people come to see
If I could buy a ticket I'd be in his arms once more
But the trains don't run from Nashville anymore

Just one more time I'd like to hear the rumble and the roar
Taking lonely hearts like mine from here to every shore
Lord, I miss my baby like I never have before
And the trains don't run from Nashville anymore

Momma waved goodbye to Daddy as he went off to war
She stood right here crying back in '64
And now it's me that stands here all alone on this old platform

Under a lavender dress it would show
And when he gave her his ring
For him she'd do anything

He had a love for her pure as diamonds
Back when good times were really good

And every night they would run
And from behind the law would soon come
She'd hold on to him so tight
And they'd disappear into the night

He used to call her wild Iris
If you said don't, she would
She had a love for him pure as diamonds

Now she's eighty and he's gone
To her grandkids she's always been old

And only sees pretty powder puffs
Down the road a black child plays
But the dreams he holds lie a cotton field away

The fires burn bright, a window breaks
Another one dies, a momma's heartaches
Behind locked doors a white man prays
And thanks the Lord he lives a cotton field away

If we could see beyond the clouds
We both might be on common ground

We met in school by court's decree
I learned real soon, you were a lot like me
Across the land they say things have changed
But still we stand a cotton field away
Still we stand a cotton field away

Kate Campbell,"He lived his life a civil service man
Designing toilets for the space program
He believed if we could go to the moon
There's nothing on earth a man can't do

So he ordered a ton of sand and clay
In his front yard he built a frame
Most folks said it'll never float
Still they came to see Bud's cement boat

A dream is anything that you want it to be
For some it's fame and fortune but for others concrete
Sometimes you just gotta follow your heart
No matter where it leads

He gave up fishing and most of his friends
Worked all night and every weekend
But he didn't mind the sacrifice
'Cause he'd build a boat that's one of a kind

Well, the neighbors thought it was a real eyesore
They'd say hey Bud what are ya building that for
And knowing they would never understand
He'd just smile and say because I can

Well, he got laid off in seventy-four
And they don't go to the moon anymore
But down around the Alabama coast
She still floats Bud's Sea-Mint boat

",Bud's Sea-Mint Boat,1997
Kate Campbell,"Once every May Day
We stayed at her house
With doilies on tables
And cats on the couch

She played me records
The ones he adored
The music they danced to
Before the war

And now sometimes I see her
And she seems so lonely
Standing there
In my moonpie dreams

He wagged his tail
When Jim let him in
He came from the next block
And they were best friends

He'd bring the paper
Without a tear
He knew his friend Jim
Would always be there

Now he waits at the back door
But it's just him only
Sitting there
In my moonpie dreams

Now I look out my window
And wish you could hold me
You're always there

In an old Winn Dixie sack
She pulled her Firebird out of the driveway
Without ever looking back

By the time she got to Georgia
It was nearly half past eight
She bought a ninety-nine cent breakfast
At the Stuckey's by the interstate

And she don't know where she's going
And she's really not sure why
But she's got to try and find a way
To live before she dies

She might see Rock City
She might see Ruby Falls
She might change her name to Marilyn
And drop her southern drawl

She wants to climb Lookout Mountain
And see all seven states
She wants to feel the wind through her hair again
Before it gets too late to see Rock City

Well, she stopped in Chattanooga
And called her mama's beauty shop
She said I won't be home for supper
Give my love to Bo and Pop

And her mama knew the reasons
Without even asking why

Nobody lives there
Only ghosts hang around

Are wrought iron fences

And made a lot people mad
They planned to bus us off across town
And things got really bad

That's when the private schools were started
And they opened in a rush
But daddy said come September
You'll be riding bus

109 bus, 109 bus
You'll be fine
(I'll)
(We'll)
On bus 109

I met Lavonna Jones in gym class
She said my hair had no curl
We played basketball together
But came from different worlds

Lavonna lived down in the projects
Compared to her I had so much
You know my life was changed forever
All because of bus

One day Lavonna came to my house
What people thought didn't matter to us
When the lines were drawn by colors
We crossed the line on bus

Prophets say the end's at hand
More bad news everywhere I turn
But in your arms, it's a perfect world

Rebels rage and lions roar
Everyday it's a brand new war
Lines are crossed and bombs are hurled
But in your arms, it's a perfect world

When your love wraps around me tight
I believe in paradise
There's one place where my heart's secure
Here in your arms, it's a perfect world

Homeless hearts on every street
Desperate eyes of poverty
No refuge left on God's green earth
But in your arms, it's a perfect world

Kate Campbell,"I can still recall the night
Lightning burned the mansion down
We all stood in out pajamas
On that hallowed southern ground

When the flames had turned to ashes
Only blackened bricks remained
And sixteen stately Doric columns
There beneath a veil of gray

And it's a long and slow surrender
Retreating from the past
It's important to remember
To fly the flag half-mast
And look away

I was taught by elders wiser
Love your neighbor, love your God
Never saw a cross on fire
Never saw an angry mob

I saw sweet magnolia blossoms
I chased lightening bugs at night
Never dreaming others saw our way of life
In black and white

Part of me hears voices crying
Part of me can feel their weight
Part of me believes that mansion
Stood for something more than hate

",Look Away,1999
Kate Campbell,"Como estas?
My name is Rosa and like my mother before me
Everyday I roll cigars and they're the finest in the world
To pass the time the reader reads about the violence in America
And I pray for my daughter and her baby girl

Late one night they took a boat ninety miles from Havana
To escape the only life I've ever known
She could have been just like me, a well-respected working woman
Who believes in her country and her home

And I wonder as I roll where will each one go
Will they land in the hands of kings and presidents
It's an art, it's a skill, and some would even kill
Just for one of Rosa's coronas

It's everywhere in the news that John Paul is on his way
And for years I've longed to see the Holy Father's parade
We've been told not to go or production falls behind
But I know the quota won't be made that day

Kate Campbell,"I feel a beating drum in my bones
And I know it's calling me to go
Where the Spanish moss drapes the trees
And the bayou whispers to let it be

Come on, let's go down the road to Rosaryville
Who knows what we will find
We won't need much on the road to Rosaryville
We can leave the world behind

It's not easy marching out of time
When other voices tell you stay in line
Some will say it's only wasted dreams
But they've never tasted wine so sweet

I see the big iron gates open wide
Follow your heart with me we'll take a ride

About heartache and desire

Coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean

I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely

Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't to bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star

Listen
They say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya
If I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

Kate Ceberano,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I have it today and give back tomorrow

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2001

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Brings back orange carpet
We called roaches butterflies
And ate our pies at Birchwood Saloon

Off the only road that leaves the state
I would sing and pass the plate
They all knew me by my face
And my father's name

Heavy letter underneath my door, stark reminder when I had before
It's hard to believe I've come this far
Heavy letter in the dresser drawer, tore it open like a candy bar
It's hard to believe I've come this far

Off to town for Moose's Tooth
You comin' with to the parkin' lot
If not you know, my window's never locked

Drew leaned in and said it
But his heart wouldn't let it
That's all right
I'll be my husband's wife

Heavy letter makes a perfect mark on the page and in the heart
It's hard to believe I've come this far
Heavy letter in the dresser drawer, tore it open like a candy bar
It's hard to believe I've come this far

Nervous, tearin' through the sky
Grievin' every inch I gain
Counting pools and freeways

I will sing and pass the plate
They will know me by my face
And my father's name

Buried treasure safe

Perfect ways,
When were you there to wipe that furrow from your brow
Can?t get no where half way
So I?ll be here till you -----
Till you say that you love me
That you love me
Cause? I left -- before everything I gained
You?ve shown too many other ways for me to call in vain
This is just a stupid secret shared too many times
It?s kinda like this thing that I would let go if I?m wise
Sorda like a warfield that sometimes makes me cry
You look just like someone I know but can not tell a lie
Can not say
Can not say
That you love me
That you love

Ambiguity will always cover the facts

When you're older, you'll look back
As you grow you'll understand
Why I left

All I talk about is you since that day
Remember when I cry into my soup
And you would say that it's okay

I'd fall so easily

With my headphones loud
So my hips can swing, so my head can nod
To the rock and roll to the boom boom beat

There's a river in my mind that's never still
Swirling, soothing all the time gives me a thrill
Swimming in the notes that go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Wandering, waking in an empty wood
It is quiet here, I am powerful
I look down below serenade the world
From inside my soul

And  I find that I'm never alone
And  I find that my heart is my home
And  the music within makes me whole

But I won't be ashamed
It feels like fate is liftin' me
I can't seem to keep my feet on the ground

I no longer hide
So I let the sun wash over me
'Cause there's no darkness left
To hold me down
And I feel it's light
Now I found the spark
That was missin' in my life

I earned these wings
I was not born with them
And it's no accident
How I walked through
The rain and the fire

'Cause it taught me how to love
It taught me how to fight
And finally I'm learning to fly

When you lose your way
When your heart breaks
When you can't escape
You feel just like a prisoner
Of all the world says you will never be
That's when you can't give up

Gotta hold on tighter now that ever
The answers will find you when you believe
And I feel it's light
Now I found the spark
That was missin in my life

I earned these wings
I was not born with them
& it's no accident
How I walked through
The rain and the fire

'Cause it taught me how to love
It taught me how to fight
& finally I'm learning to fly

And I tried yea I tried to get somewhere that I'd rather be
But sometimes the fastest way is not so easy

I earned these wings
I was not born with them
& it's no accident

Kate Fenner,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry

And I've always known, you're like a feather
You go where wind and fire melt together

But I'm sure you're on your way home

And I'm sure you're faster than before
Yes, I know you're somewhere on the road
And I reckon there is nothing more to say

The way Contini puts his image through a prism

I love the dark handsome guys
With their skinny little ties dressing mod looking out of sight
I love to watch them as they cruise
With their pointy leather shoes wearing shades in the middle of the nights

He is the essence of Italian style
I love the glamorously Latin world that only Guido can portray

His angles wide & tight
Each moment feels so right
Defines Italian style by only his decision
I love the speedy little cars the hip coffee bars the sleek women in Positano

Leaving London England
In the pouring rain
Tell my sister
To tell my mother
I'm coming home
Home alone
Someday I'll be back again
To that green and pleasant land
Between the Channel and the sea
Across the ocean, that's where I want to be

But until the, tie me to the ground
I've got to let these weary bones rest
>From all that runnin' around
Tell my sister
To tell my mother
I'm coming home
Home alone

",Tell My Sister,1975
Kate McGarrigle,"Just a little atom of chlorine
Valence minus one
Swimming through the sea, digging the scene
Just having fun
She's not worried about the shape or size
Of her outside shell
It's fun to ionize
Just a little atom of cl
With an unfilled shell

But somewhere in that sea lurks
Handsome sodium
With enough electrons on his outside shell
Plus that extra one
Somewhere in this deep blue sea 
There's a negative
For my extra energy yes
Somewhere in this foam
My positive will find a home

Then unsuspecting chlorine
Felt a magnetic pull
She looked down and her outside
Shell was full
Sodium cried ""what a gas be my bride and
I'll change your name from chlorine to chloride""

Now the sea evaporates to make the clouds
For the rain and snow
Leaving her chemical compounds in the absence
Of H2O
But the crystals that wash upon the shore
Are happy ones
So if you never thought before
Think of the love that you eat
When you salt your meat
Think of the love that you eat
When you salt your meat",NA CL,1978
Kate McGarrigle,"I had a dream last night
That gave my heart a fright
I dreamt that someone had come and taken you
From me

When I woke in the morning light
My dream had been wrong
And these words were like a sweet song
To me

""Mama, the small hand's at eight
Get up or I'll be late
Please fix me something sweet and good
To eat now

For that bell in the yard won't wait
And neither does time""
These words rang like a sad rhyme
To me

With my eyes barely open
I pulled myself out of my warm bed
The night before had been a long one
And I could hardly hold up my head

But the sun always rises
And night fades away
Once more I'm grateful
To see a new day

Whether it's right or wrong
You keep my head screwed on
You are reality and fantasy all in one

You're my reason for going on
And I don't know what I'd do

Kate McGarrigle,"Love it's not I who didn't try
Hard enough hard enough
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough

Love you don't see the pain in me
It's plain enough, plain enough
You're never here to catch the tears
I cry for us, I cry for us

I'll take my share but I'll be fair
There's not much stuff, easy enough
And if you chose, I'll break the news
This part is tough, so very tough

I've tried and tried to put aside
A time to talk, but without luck
So I'll just pin this note within your coat
And leave the garden gate unlocked

Love it's not I who didn't try
Hard enough hard enough
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough",I Cried for Us,1983
Kate McGarrigle,"I could say love over and over and over

Kate McGarrigle,"Now I think it's time to go
For I have prolonged my stay
I can tell by the clouds that cover the moon
That it's time to be on my way

I could take that flight at midnight
Or set sail with the rising tide
My bags are packed, I won't be back
Quietly out of your life I'll slide

You're not saying that you want me to stay

Kate McGarrigle,"Oh father come to the window
Look over yonder lake
At the wondrous golden city
Beyond the icy wake
In my short life we've passed this way
Ten times or more
And never did this city
Rise up on that far shore

That's the Sun son, shining on the water
It's not Cairo, New York or Rome
And just a matter of hours before you see your mama
Waiting for you back at home

Big buildings at it's centre
Stand ablaze with light
While lesser spires around these
Entrap the beams in flight
Oh look now I see people
With faces small and fine
And in their midst just staring
A boy's face like mine

That's the Sun son, shining on the water
It's not Cairo, New York or Rome
And just a matter of hours before you see your mama
Waiting for you back at home

The Sun was shrinking 'cause night was falling
And the boy went off to sleep
His wondrous city vanished
Into the icy deep
The Moon was rising 'cause night had fallen
And all was as before
As we made our way past the countless pines
On the cold lake's northern shore

While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,

Many days you have lingered all around my door.

Kate McGarrigle,"Willie Moore was a young man, his age 21 and he courted a damsel fair
Oh, her eyes were as white as a diamond after night and a wavy jet black wore her hair
He courted her by night and day until marriage they did agree
Oh, but when he came to get her parents' consent they said it could never be

She threw herself in Willie Moore's hands as often they've done before
Oh, but little did he think as he left her that night, sweet Annie he would see no more
It was about the 10th of may, a time i remember it well
That very same night little Annie disappeared in a way no tongue can tell

Sweet Annie was loved both far and near, she had friends almost all around
And near a little brook not far from her home the body of sweet Annie were found
Her parents now are left alone, one mourns while the other'n weeps
And near a grassy mound outside the cottage door the body of sweet Annie sleeps

Willie Moore scarcely spoke to his friends they say from the moment they both did part
And his last day was spent near his true lover's grave where he died of a broken heart",Willie Moore,1995

Ma never told me, never told me 'bout you""

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

He bought a shotgun

Stood for law and order.

Came the cry, ""We got to ride
To clean up the streets
For our wives and our daughters!""

And I'm always hungover when someone wants to talk 
And don't get me wrong, I like talking 
When it's a healthy back-and-forth exchange 
But some people always wanna lecture me 
And try to make me change 
He says 'You are a mystery, aren't you' 
And considering he hasn't shut up long enough for me to string two words together 
Yes that's me, Miss Mystery 
And he's quiet for a time 
And I think that might be a good sign 
Til there's a glint in his eye and I realize 
He's just making more sentences in his mind 
And here it comes, and there's nothing I can do 
I take a sip, I take a breath 
He licks his lips and he's opening his mouth, and it's:

Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 
Blah blah dog diggity blah

Like a steam train 
Like an onslaught 
Like a machine gun loaded with your opinions 
But it's incoherent ammunition 
And your words aren't very wounding weapons 
When they're inflicted on me 
And I know you mean well 
With your deep wells of advice 
And your buckets of swelled self-righteousness 
Hell, you're just trying to be nice 
And you're nice, but you state your views like they are facts of life 
And I hate that, and I tell you 
And I brace myself for the reply, it's gonna be

Of pressing topics of discussion 
Competing with the clanking coffee cup percussion

Your skin was electric 
Now I'm far too wise to dwell on such things 
And far too sentimental to forget them 
I read somewhere memories are stories you write for yourself 
To explain who you are, and how you got there 
And to blame it on somebody else 

Now the gifts are open 
The toys are broken 
The speeches are all spoken 
And the dishes cleared away 
The stream keeps flowing 
My doubts are growing 
'Cause I've got no way of knowing 
If it'll be damned or reach the sea 
For you and me

I met a man twice my age 
Half joking, he said ""I should warn you. 
You're a fish on the line, 
And the lines pulling in, 
And there's a frying pan coming to warm you""
And while I smiled, it occurred to me 
I'm just gristle and blood 
And I've spent half my life with the sun in my eyes 
Chasing rainbows through the mud

My heart was the same as the one I have now 
But it amazes me how much everything else has changed",Day After Christmas,2004

Like a telegram.
Said ""I don't know where I am, or how I got here. I don't have a stamp.""

You look just like your picture only deeper,
And your smile was shyer and your shirt 
Was a bit less ironed.

And folded you up nice and even

And sent you 
And sent you 
And sent you 
To me.

Just bring your suitcases inside.
Come on, come in,
You don't have to say anything.
Hello, get out of the rain,
Here we go again.

The truth is, you are an angel
Most of the time I don't feel too guilty,
So when you look at me and I can see my dirty shadow
On your halo glow.
But I wanna keep things simple,
No complications,
No late nights and no empty rain stations.
Remember last time?
We don't want it like that 

This time around

Just bring your suitcases inside.

Kate Miller-Heidke,"When we go out dancing on a Friday night
I get this funny feeling something's not quite right
My sense of rhythm is incontrovertibly shite
I can't fake it

I can see the pity in your big brown eyes
The perpetrator lies between my back and my thighs
It doesn't want to wiggle though I try try try
I can't make it

I get the feeling that I look absurd
I get the feeling that I look absurd, and it hurts

I just can't shake it

Couldn't walk the line inside the country scene
And disco was a flop I'm sure no dancing queen
Couldn't really qualify for breakdancing
I just break it

Tried moving my body to the latest hit
Someone called the nurse thought I was having a fit
I execute the moonwalk like I stepped in shit
I can't take it

I get the feeling that I look absurd
I get the feeling that I look absurd - and it hurts

Kate Miller-Heidke,"There was a guy at my school when I was in high school
We'd ride side by side in the morning on our bicycles
Never even spoken or faced each other
But on the last hill we'd race each other

When we reached the racks we'd each go our own way
I wasn't in his classes, I didn't know his name
When we finally got to speak he just stared at his feet
And mumbled a sentence that ended with 'James'

I was young and caught in the crowd
I didn't know then what I know now
I was dumb, and I was proud
And I'm sorry
If I could go back do it again
I'd be someone you could call friend
Please please believe that I'm sorry

Well he was quite a big guy, kinda shy and quiet
When the kids called him weird he didn't try to deny it
Every lunchtime he'd spend walking by himself
Round the boundary of the grounds til he heard the bell

Well one day I found him, joined him on his walk
We were silent for a while until we started to talk
I told him my family were fighting in court
He said his step-dad and him always fought

We talked about music, he was into punk
Told me all the bands that I liked were junk
I said I'd never heard the songs the sex pistols sang
I laughed back at him and then the bell rang

I was young and caught in the crowd
I didn't know then what I know now
I was dumb, and I was proud
And I'm sorry
If I could go back do it again
I'd be someone you could call friend
Please please believe that I'm sorry

It was after school in the afternoon
The corridors were crowded as we came out of the rooms
Three guys I knew pushed him into the cement
Threw away his bag and said he had no friends

He yelled that he did and he looked around
Tried getting up but they pushed him on down
That's when he saw me, called out my name
And I turned my back, and just walked away
Yeah I turned my back, and just walked away

Coughed like the kid on the Panadol ad
You just smiled and kicked the dirt
Said, ""We're not as cool as we thought we were""

I climbed out the window so I wouldn't be missed
Getting too big for the swings in the park

Tears in the water
Water in the wine

Sharing cigarettes under the stars

You the lost the wheel, you missed the turn
The whole world rolled on top of us

There was a bagpiper piping
There were three too many bridesmaids
But you were not with me

I want things back the way they were

Same moon on the same trees
I lie in the same bed where I held you
Through winter nights that were just like these

The old piano or the sound of rain

To hold beside me while I sleep

So goodnight, my favourite dream
To share your air, share your air ‘til dawn
So goodnight, my favourite dream
To share your air, share your air once more

Unbearable thought that my love could not hold you
Here comes the silence, here comes the quiet
Unbearable ache, to feel that I’ve lost you
How can my soul be satisfied?
Oh how can my soul be satisfied?

Kate Miller-Heidke,"There are different kinds of loneliness
And I have always been good
Good at raising up the drawbridges
Good at knocking on wood
I could make myself invisible
I could be a better liar
Anything would be better
Than to sit here and wonder

What was I to you?
Some kind of life lesson?
Or something worth forgetting?
Just a stray you let in?
What was I to you?
A stain on your perfect record?
A slip, a blip, a wrong chord?
I get why you had to go
But the thing I really want to know
Is what was I to you?

I can’t claim what I gave away
Keep the fire but not the flame
Feel my face on your face again
Hey, hey
You know I’ve told you this a
thousand times
Except I never press ‘send’
But anything would be better

A slip, a blip, a wrong chord?
I get why you had to go
But the thing I really want to know
Is what was I to you?

Just in case you were ever wondering
what you were to me
You were the biggest let-down, the one
who got the power just by being so weak
You wasted all my time, moved on at the
speed of light
I don’t know what to believe

I remember everything you said
That night inside our tent by the torchlight
Do you remember how I made you laugh?
You said, ‘I hope I die before you’
I remember walking through a forest
You said that you thought we might be dreaming
Then we made it to the top of a waterfall
And we jumped down hand-in-hand and screaming

Remember the feeling
remember the feeling
remember the feeling

I could hear the wheels squeal around the bend
My only consolation
I could travel down the path that never ends
Sweet sensation 
I ran my mind all the way back to better times
But I don’t want to be your memory

Yours was the body that rhymed with my body
And I just don’t think there will ever be anybody else
Yours was the body that fit mine completely
And I fail to see how there could ever be anybody else

and I'll find the love I need.
I know it's out there somewhere
somehow I still believe, so I'm askin' please,

This world can get crazy 
These are troubled times
I'd walk through the fire if love is what I'll find.
It's out of my hands now, so I put my faith in you.
And I say a little prayer and hope that it comes true.

Yeah the girls they all looked at her
And they thought she was quite strange
And the boys they're not really into girls at that age
And the teachers, they thought Mariella was just going through a phase.
But Mariella just smiled as she skipped down the road
Because she knew all the secrets in her world
Yes, she always got the crossword puzzle right everyday
And she could do the alphabet backwards
Without making any mistakes

Kate Nash,"Skeleton, you are my friend
But you are made of bone
And you have got no flesh and blood
Running through you to help protect the bone

Skeleton, we have been friends for years
And you have seen me through some trials
And tribulations and some tears
But everybody thinks I'm weird

And I should have known that it wouldn't be long
Until you, you've got me standing in an awkward position
With unwanted attention and a need for explanation
And it's not that I'm letting go of you
But I don't know what to do

Skeleton, we are so close
But you have got no body
So, why do you insist on wearing clothes?

Skeleton, when we were young, it was easy
Even though the other kids, they would tease me
I was only seven, I had you but now I'm twenty two

And now it's different when I take you out
And you, you've got me standing in an awkward position
With unwanted attention and a need for explanation
And it's not that I'm letting go of you
But I don't know what to do

And sometimes at night
I dream of the most terrible things
I take, take a hammer and I creep out of bed
And I raise it high and I smash your head
Fibular and tubular and ribs and cages, too
In fact, while I'm here, I'll smash the whole of you

But skeleton, you are my friend
And I could never bring your life to an end
Yes, skeleton, you are, you are my friend
And I'll be there for you until the end

And even though when I take you out
You've got me, you've got me
Standing in an awkward position
With unwanted attention and a need for explanation
I could, I could never let you go

And that is all I, that is all I know

Kate Nash,"Simply, knowing you exist
Ain't good enough for me
But asking for your telephone number
Seems highly inappropriate

Seeing as I can't, you don't say hi and you walk by
And that time you shook my hand, it felt so nice
I swear I've never felt this way about any other guy
And I don't usually notice people's eyes but

I conducted a plan to bump into you most accidentally
But I was walking along and I bumped into you
Much more heavily than I'd originally planned
It was well embarrassing
And I think you thought that I was a bit of a twat

I just think that we'd get on
Oh, I wish I could tell you face to face
Instead of singing this stupid song
But yeah, I just think that we might get on

So, I went to that party
Everyone, they're kind of arty
And I was wearing this dress
'Cause I wanted to impress
But I wasn't sure if I looked my best
'Cause I was so nervous

But I carried on regardless
Strutting through each room trying to find you
And when I saw you kissing that girl
My heart, it shattered and my eyes, they watered
And when I tried to speak, I stuttered

And my friends were like, ""Whatever
You'll find someone better
His eyes are way to close together
And we never even liked him from the start
And now he's with that tart
And I heard she done some really nasty stuff
Down in the park with Michael""

""He said she's easy
And if your guy's with someone that's sleazy
Then he ain't worth your time
'Cause you deserve a real nice guy""
So, I proceeded to get drunk and to cry
Locked myself in the toilets for the entire night

Saturday night, I watched Channel 5
I particularly liked CSI
I don't ever dream about you and me
I don't ever make up stuff about us
That would because that's insanity

I don't ever drive by your house
To see if you're in
I don't even have an opinion
On that tramp that you are still seeing

I don't know your timetable
I don't know your face of by heart
But I must admit that there's still a part of me
That thinks we might get on
That we could get on, that we should get on",We Get On,2007

So I'm running late on purpose

Does it speak?
Will I feel it?
Will it hurt?
Am I near it?

I don't know how more people haven't got mental health problems

And learn some new words

I'm going to start with that
I'd like to travel
I want to see India and the pyramids

I'm not sure about rivers, they scare me
But I love swimming, I'm good at it
And when I swim I think about numbers
And count the laps
When I was younger I saw a house burnt down
And I walked past it everyday for the next six years
Derelict, black, chalky and dangerous
I wondered if squatters lived there
I'm still not sure but I know there were never any parties cause it was shit
After a while the council got round to tidying out the town
Making it less offensive here and there
They said it was an eyesore so they let tore it down
Behind the house was a wall with a few bits of crappy graffiti
and the word 'Cunt' written on it in giant letters
And now I walk past that

I like sitting in the park
And I like walking through it
I like taking my dogs there
And friends, and I like being alone
I like flowers and simplicity
I like compassion and thoughtful gifts
I like being able to shout

When I'm quiet people think I'm sad
And usually I am

Kate Nash,"I fancy the hip rock 'n' roll sinister 
I wanna be fucked and then rolled over 
Cause I'm an independent woman of the 21st century 
No time for knits, I want sex and debauchery 
I read glamor and the guardian 

I like flowers & I'm hardy & I take cocaine 
I don't give a fuck about her I want your name 
I can get fucked like the best of men 
Like the best of men Like the worst of pain 
Inflicted on another young girl again 
Impressed by another guitar hero 
He's a top score & you're a zero 
You're out of your league 

There ain't no rubber on the tracks it's gravel 
You fall hard, cut quick and it's an STD, a cut knee 
You're a side of stage grasp, a laugh 
An after show party in a bath 

Fucked and expected to be fucked 
A gasp from an uninformed intruder 
The crowd go wild and things get ruder 

They're already out of hand and there's no-one here 
To take your hand. It's a cold shower and a scramble 
For a dirty pair of knicker, don't get yours mixed up with hers 
Now get out of bed, get out of bed, get out get out get get out of bed 

Get up, get down & get undressed! Cause that's what you 
Do best, strip, strip strip n shag, fuck get fucked 'n drag, 
And be impressed, by the better sex, take a piece of raw 
Vegetable and hold it to your breast and say you stood 
For nothing. You were just a hole that lacked passion, 
Another undignified product of society. That girl 
Should have been a mansion.",Mansion Song,2010
Kate Nash,"You've come so far, well done darling
We knew that you had it in you
You can do anything that you want, world is an oyster, don't disappoint us
You can stand on your own two feet, you can lead me through the streets
Pave the way, so we can dream dreams, no one else can see what you made me see
Still climbing trees, tripping up over fallen leaves, but holding hands
No one else could ever understand what it's like between us

And that's between us, but I know that

You'll never listen to me, no you'll never listen to me
No you'll never listen to me, no you'll never listen to me
You'll never listen to me, no you'll never listen to me
No you'll never listen to me, no you'll never listen to me

Kate Nash,"Picked you out my pocket, and you fell into the road
You asked me if I'd make it better
Asked me if we could grow old together
But you don't mean a thing to me
So I'll walk by quite happily
And now I guess that you've moved on as well

You took me to the bricks
You start to build a wall
Keep peace intact
Protect your family
Keep them from harm
Live peacefully, but they came crumbling down
The second you left town,
And now your family are gone, are gone

Understand me, take me, fully
Underground where I can not be found
Understand me, take me, fully
Underground where I can not be found

And a letter that you wrote
That had been stashed inside my wall
Telling me all about your life
It had been there for a quite a while
It skipped out certain chapters
That I thought had really mattered
And now I feel like I missed out

Out, baby out, get out of town
Baby out, baby out, get out
Baby out, baby out, get out of town
Before it catches up with you
And you cannot withstand
Before it catches up with you
And you cannot withstand
Before it catches up with you
And you cannot withstand",Pickpocket,2010

So I will never open my heart

We could go somewhere breezy
But it gets so complicated

Just one more time the reasons why you must leave,
Tell me once more why you're sure you don't need me,
Tell me again but, don't think that you'll convince me.

Now you've said,
Before falling in love again you'd rather be dead,
'Cause when someone breaks your heart, you cry your eyes red,
But there's nothing so hard about the life that you've led.

As far as I can see,
There's no reason for goodbyes,
You're just running scared,
And that's something I won't buy.

So you lose,
I won't let you go with nothing to show but more blues,
And all this talk about leaving is strictly bad news,
So you settle down and stay with the man that loves you.

As private as private can be

I think you just must have lost your mind
Affected by the sun
And how the heavens lined up as we made our run
Blood stained the lanes
And I could barely feel the pain
I loved you so much more
I loved you so much more

Take me in your arms

Demons hung out to dry

Got rules but I dig it, God knows that I'm wicked
Or does it, cause when I tug it, it never shows that I visit

So stand out amazed when I let loose on my Beelzebubs
My spirit needs jumper cables, never know love but I want ya label

To people without rules, and make you doubt who's
Gonna love you forever cause they gave you some hateful mouth ooze

Now that I'm lonely, I don't get no fun like Laos food
And I'm such a meanie, wanna come and see me? Reroute dudes

You think I'm asleep when you go sneak away for a bit
I hear you talking to her why do you treat me like this
Why do you make it so hard to admit
Player would never show his hand
I become something they can't stand
In the long run they on one, our song's done
Get they bags and they bounce
And they say I'm sick and need a little counseling

Get up out of your room, treat me like a buffoon

It's funny how the world lives up to all your expectations
With adventures for the stout of heart, and the lure of the open spaces

There's 2 lanes running down this road, whichever side you're on
Accounts for where you want to go, or what you're running from
Back when darkness overtook me on a blind man's curve

I relied upon the moon and Saint Christopher
Now I've paid my dues cuz I have owed them, but I've paid a price sometimes
For being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times

Now I've paid my dues cuz I have owed them, but I've paid a price sometimes
For being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times

But now I'm grown and I speak like a woman and I see with a woman's eyes
And an open door is to me now like the saddest of goodbyes
It's too late for turning back, I pray for the heart and the nerve

Two lovers danced to an old radio
The music played clear and bright
The radio sweethearts waltzed all night

She was pretty, he was tall
He placed the furniture next to the wall
They closed their eyes, the stars shone bright
The radio sweethearts waltzed all night

Years have passed, the lovers are gone
The story is over I'm told
But I believe, and I always will
The radio sweethearts are waltzin' still

Last night, I had a dream
That mama and papa had met once again
There in the glow of heaven's light
Oh, the radio sweethearts waltzed all night

The story is over I'm told
But I believe, and I always will

Kate Ryan,"Cendre de lune, petite bulle d'écume
Poussée par le vent, je brûle et je m'enrhume
Entre mes dunes reposent mes infortunes
C'est nue, que j'apprends la vertu

Je, je suis libertine
Je suis une catin
Je, je suis si fragile
Qu'on me tienne la main

Fendre la lune, baisers d'épine et de plume
Bercée par un petit vent, je déambule
La vie est triste comme un verre de grenadine
Aimer c'est pleurer quand on s'incline

Je, je suis libertine
Je suis une catin
Je, je suis si fragile
Qu'on me tienne la main

Quand sur mon corps tu t'endors
Je m'évapore
Bébé tu dors et moi j'attends l'aurore
Quand de mes lèvres tu t'enlèves
Un goût amer
Me rappelle que je suis au ciel

Cendre de lune, petite bulle d'écume
Perdue dans le vent, je brûle et je m'enrhume
Mon corps a peur, la peau mouillée, j'ai plus d'âme
Papa, ils ont violé mon cœur

Je, je suis libertine
Je suis une catin

When my body feels tired
And my soul is weak
Then my eyes won't see
And my hands won't feel a thing

When I don't get inspired
By something you tell me at night
Just an empty soul
I don't have control of myself
Just an empty soul
I don't have control of myself

I wanna know - Can you fix this ?
Help me to cope - Can you fix this ?
Fill the void that's left inside of me
Repair the lost of love dividing me

I wanna know - Can you fix this ?
Help me to cope - Can you fix this ?
Fill the void that's left inside of me
Repair the lost of love dividing me

Try to give me devotion
'Cause my heart can't breathe
And my tears will fall
And my eyes will try to see

I can't show my emotions
Help me out of this pain
'Cause I'm paralyzed and it's driving me insane.
'Cause I'm paralyzed and it's driving me insane.

Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry

One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high

It's time that I learned from
The mistakes that has made
This never ending circle of just heartaches

Now is the time
To get it together and shine
Try to figure out of
Who I am and what I want

How many times do I have to rise and fall?

How many times hit my head against the wall?
'Till I find the secret

So many nights that I cried a thousand tears
For the one who turned out not to be the one
How many times is enough?

So I'm alone here once again

I'm broken but not scattered into pieces

Just have to stand up and fight

Why imagine what our love could be?
You know you wanna
Touch the passion that's inside of me
Get outta your mind

Lose your body control
You'll never get high 'till you let it all go

Just how good our love could be?

Try to find what life's supposed to be

What to do when I don't know

Something had me want it
I just let it go isn't that ironic?
How I can't say, ""No""
I cannot explain, can't put my finger on it

The touch a constant craving
For more of something only
You know and I still don't know
What happened to me

Tonight when magic happens
Alive counting the seconds
Till you're here want you oh so near

Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing

If someone asks, this where I'll be, where I'll be

Hi yo we drift in and out
Hi yo sing into my mouth
Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I'm just an animal looking for a home
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me till my heart stops
Love me till I'm dead
Eyes that light up, eyes look through you
Cover up the blank spots
Hit me on the head

But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

It makes my body hot
So let me tell ya baby I'll tell your mama 
I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone who's heart can comprehend
Send it in a letter baby tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl who likes to be alone

The lazy, lazy river in the non day sun
Linger in the shade of a kind old tree
Throw away your-our troubles

Awakes the bright new morning
Where we can move along
Blue skies up above, everyone's in love

Sweetheart of mine, it's more than a valentine.
Be careful, it's my heart.

Lonely men with lonely eyes are seeking her in vain
Her streets are where they were, but there's no sign of her

She has left the Seine

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
I heard the laughter of her heart in every street cafÃ¢??

The last time I saw Paris, her trees were dressed for spring,
And lovers walked beneath those trees and birds found songs to sing.

I dodged the same old taxicabs that I had dodged for years.
The chorus of their squeaky horns was music to my ears.

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
No matter how they change her, I'll remember her that way.

I'll think of happy hours, and people who shared them
Old women, selling flowers, in markets at dawn

Children who applauded, Punch and Judy in the park
And those who danced at night and kept our Paris bright

'Til the town went dark.",The Last Time I Saw Paris [From Lady Be Good],1996
Kate Smith,"There's a song in the land of the lily
Each sweetheart has heard with a sigh
Over high garden walls this sweet echo falls
As a soldier boy whispers goodbye

Smile the while you kiss me sad adieu
When the clouds roll by I'll come to you
Then the skies will seem more blue
Down in Lover's Lane, my dearie

Wedding bells will ring so merrily
Ev'ry tear will be a memory
So wait and pray each night for me
Till we meet again

Though goodbye means the birth of a teardrop
Hello means the birth of a smile
And the smile will erase the tear blighting trace
When we meet in the after awhile

Smile the while you kiss me sad adieu
When the clouds roll by I'll come to you
Then the skies will seem more blue
Down in Lover's Lane, my dearie

Wedding bells will ring so merrily
Ev'ry tear will be a memory
So wait and pray each night for me
Till we meet again",Till We Meet Again,1996
Kate Smith,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1996
Kate Smith,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you
",I'm Getting Sentimental over You,1996
Kate Smith,"The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we

The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly",Tenderly,1996
Kate Smith,"I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar Carols play
And wide and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth good will to man

I thought as now this day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rung so long the unbroken song
Of peace on earth good will to man

And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth good will to man

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor does he sleep
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth good will to man",I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day,1997
Kate Smith,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Kate Smith,"Sometimes in the morning when shadows are deep, 
I lie here beside you, just watching you sleep, 
And sometimes I whisper what I'm thinking of, 
My cup runneth over with love, 

Sometimes in the evening when you do not see, 
I study the small things you do constantly, 
I memorize moments that I'm fondest of, 
My cup runneth over with love, 

In only a moment we both will be old, 
We won't even notice the world turning cold, 
And so in this moment with sunlight above, 
My cup runneth over with love. 

With love!",My Cup Runneth Over,1997
Kate Smith,"When you walk through a storm
Keep your chin up high
And don't be afraid of the dark

What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars
Through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched
Were so gallantly streaming
And the rockets red glare
The bombs bursting in air

And the home of the brave!",Star Spangled Banner,1997

That misery loves company, wait and see

I mean, I wanna be around to see how he does it

This is where our story ends,
Never lovers, ever friends.

Goodbye, Let our hearts call it a day,
But before you walk away,
I sincerely want to say:

I wish you bluebirds in the Spring,
To give your heart a song to sing;
And then a kiss, but more than this I wish you love.

And in July, a lemonade,
To cool you in some leafy glade;
I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love.

That you and I could never be,
So with my best, my very best, I set you free.

Life was serene, I knew where I was at
""There's no hope for him,"" my dearest friends would mutter
I was something dragged in by the cat. Then

Just in time, I found you just in time
Before you came my time was running low
I was lost, the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, nowhere to go

The praise of the crowd, it's exciting

Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five and ten, glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the grand hotel and one in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing, right within your heart

Because it does what you want it to do.
It has a passion, The Continental,

It's quite the fashion, The Continental,
Because you tell of your love while you dance.
Your lips whisper so tenderly.
Her eyes answer your song.

Two bodies swaying, The Continental,
And you are saying just what you're dreaming of.
So keep on dancing, The Continental,
For it's a song of romance and of love.
You kiss while you're dancing.

Not a bad idea. 
The Continental, hmmmmm. It's continental.
You sing while you're dancing.
Your voice is gentle and sentimental.

You stroll together arm in arm.
You nonchalantly glide along with grace and charm.

If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead

I always wanted a real home with flowers on the window sill
But if you want to live in New York City, honey, you know I will
I never thought I could get satisfaction from just one man
If anyone can keep me happy, you're the one who can

Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere that you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead

Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere that you tell me to

Kate Taylor,"I need love, love to ease my mind,
I need to find, find someone to call mine,
But mama said you can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take.
You can't hurry love,
No, you just have to wait,
You gotta trust, give it time,
No matter how long it takes;
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again.
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on,
When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone,
I remember mama said,

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take.
How long must I wait how much more can I take,
Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone.
I grow impatient for a love to call my own,
But when I feel that I, I can't go on,
These precious words keeps me hanging on,
I remember mama said,

Can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
it's a game of give and take.

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take
No matter how long it takes.

No love, love don't come easy,
But I keep on waiting, anticipating for that
Soft voice to talk to me at night,
For some tender arms to hold me tight.
I keep waiting; I keep on waiting,
But it ain't easy, it ain't easy when mama said

You can't hurry love no,
You just have to wait,
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes.

Kate Taylor,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend
",Loving You Was Easier,1979
Kate Taylor,"Sweet as a honey bee but like a honey bee stings,
you've gone and left my heart in pain.
All you left is our favorite song, the one we danced to all night long.
It used to bring sweet memories of a tender love that used to be,
now it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone.
 
Fool am I to hear a old love song.
And wanna cry but the melody keeps haunting me 
reminding me how in love we used to be.
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our heart saying together forever.
Breaking up never, it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song, 
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone.
 
Precious memories keep-a lingering on, 
ev'rytime I hear our favorite song, now you're gone, left this emptiness, 
I only reminisce.
The happiness we spent, we used to dance to the music
make romance to the music, 
now it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone. 
Oh I can't bear to hear it, 
it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning since you been gone; 
it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning since you been gone;

Kate Tempest,"Who's bad? Said the the kiddy in the Jacko hat
To the kiddy in the Rooney shirt
Dragging back
The curtains in the room in her daddy's flat
A young girl heard the truth in an alley-cat
Howling on the roof next door
Imagine that
All your idols were just like you
Nothing's beyond you
Do what you want to do if you feel that it wants you to
Look
True never meant nothing more than it means right now
When everything's fake
But you in your deepest reaches keeping secrets
Know what it takes to make a meaning means something
I’m moving through a space that some can't see
I know this space exists
So do you if your heart beats the oldest groove
Life is huge but we have shrunk it
We've made it small
We used to walk tall
But who cares, right?
We’re having a ball

Them things you don't show, I can see
Them things you don't say, speak to me
Them things you hide ain't hiding
No firm ground but we ain't sliding

Them things that haunt you, let them be
That thing you weep for, leave it

All life is forwards, you will see
It needs you to need it

Go ahead, keep it in ‘til it withers you
Move fast, don’t stop, you got things to do
Tell yourself, it’s them man it isn’t you
Nod your head and believe that until it’s true
You can tell it not to show its face
When you are trying to hold your space
But it’s in you deep in your sinews
And it comes out on the coldest days

See the kid with the memory he can’t shake
See the man with the lover on his mind
See the lady with the guilt and the heartache
See the woman trying to battle with time
See the man with the blood on his hands
See the girl with her hands on her hips
Everybody say nothing. Stay bland
If you don’t show it then it don’t exist
Right?

Them things you don't show, I can see
Them things you don't say, speak to me
Them things you hide ain't hiding
No firm ground but we ain't sliding

Them things that haunt you, let them be
That thing you weep for, leave it

All life is forwards, you will see
It's yours when you’re ready to receive it

You’re so focused on finding the differences
You ignore the bonds that bind us
Got my hand on my heart when the rhythm hits
It’s looking for us but can’t find us
In the valley of vanity, viciousness
Full schedules and empty containers
We’re kissing the coshes that cripple us
Enjoying the Beigeness
Do it your way and they’ll find you ridiculous
Pick apart your behaviour
Their scorn ignites what inhibits us
And then we hate ourselves
And our fear pickles us
Sitting in jars ‘cause it’s safer
Some of us are happy to live with it
But some of us know it’s against our nature

Them things you don't show, I can see
Them things you don't say, speak to me
Them things you hide ain't hiding
No firm ground but we ain't sliding

Them things that haunt you, let them be
That thing you weep for, leave it

It's yours when you’re ready to receive it

Kate Tempest,"Harry’s staring at his chicken
He’s trying hard to listen without hating
But everything David says
Seems to make him like him less
His little brother Pete is waiting
For the appropriate place to say
‘Oh right, yeah’
And make an interested face

Miriam feels distant
She knows her sons are trying hard
But trying hard
Just increases the friction
It’s never been tense like this

Harry looks around at his mother’s new kitchen
And can’t help but think of his dad

Alone in that house where they all used to live
Putting his half pint of semi-skimmed
Back into the fridge
Dad
With his silent ways
And his smiling face
No romance, just basic
Straight forwards, no frills, no fuss
But at least he was a man you could trust

Not like this guy, this David
Face like a pill head at the end of a rave
Staring at my mum like he wants to be saved
Harry feels weak today, he can’t take it

And he doesn’t know it but he’s glaring
Thinking of Becky
And why he insisted on sharing
So much with a stranger
He feels a faint sense of danger
Ashamed that he’d made a
Fool of himself, he’s an idiot
Sees it in his mind’s eye, insidious
Him, spilling out his guts like a suicidal shogun
Looking for deliverance
Dithering fool feeling silly and hopelessly broken
Blithering on while she was smoking

What was he thinking?
Heart opening up like it was blinking
Becky. He feels her name, it’s heavy
Don’t forget me

Snap back to the room
He flinches at the image
Miriam is finishing her wine
And Pete is asking for the spinach

‘Er, how’s work, Harry?’
David’s features are tipped towards him
‘Fine, thanks,’ Harry looks up, ‘exhausting.’
‘Yes,’ David smiles, ‘but hard work is always rewarding.’
Even David’s enthusiasm is boring

‘How long have you worked there?’ he asks
And Harry thinks of all them years he’s spent
Scheming and shotting
‘Little while, now. To be honest, I’ve forgotten.’
‘Oh yes, well time does fly in the work place,’
David smiles, nodding

All he ever wanted to be was good enough
All he ever wanted to say was the right thing
But as long as you live for the way you’re perceived
You will never create, only bite things

All he ever wanted to do was the done thing
All he ever wanted to make was the grade
But as long as you live for other people’s opinions
You’ll never be more than afraid",Chicken,2014

I just go round and round
I’m paranoid, I’m selfish
Push me, I clam up, I’m shellfish

That eats me up, that’s Elvis
Las Vegas era
I’m half bag lady, half Bagheera

I got my hand on my heart
But my heart’s in the gutter
Talking to itself, starting to flutter
When it thinks about yours
Barking at mutts like a nutter
Trying to start wars on the bus

Dumb chunk of muscle with its claws out
Throwing its oars out the dinghy in the middle of a gale
Making whirlpools the way I chase my tail

I go round in circles

Not neatly, not like compass and pencil
More like a dog on a lead, going mental

Sitting in a pub with my eyes closed
Swaying to a power ballad
Shredding tears at the high notes
My hands are frozen, I forgot my gloves
My heart is broken, I don’t want no love
Love just rots your guts
If you’re the type to feel what you touch

No wait, my hands are smoking on this hot tea cup
My heart is open, all I want is love
Love will prop you up

There must be more than this
I don’t know why I can’t change
There ain’t no groundhogs here
There’s just me in my garden
Howling at the moon when it’s round and clear

Kick a fag box and you might find it’s got some in it
I love that
Just when I think something’s ending
The beginning comes back

Get away with a child travelcard on the bus
I love that
Just when I think something’s ending

See something great
Happen to a mate

Eyes like Pot holes in tarmac
Complexion the colour of chewed up bar snacks

Pete took him to the pub and the conversation dragged
So Pete got pissed, pretty soon he had more than his usual
Approaching legless
He found himself opening up

With his head in his hands

Right, she's got this job but I don't like it

And to exist in a way that will give her the means to live for for than a dull routine""

Kate Tempest,"‘Everybody Down!
He’ll be here in a second, I reckon’
And Becky beckoned them round
And made them get on their knees
Behind the bar
They held their breath
And stifled giggles

Crouched down
Like a twenty-headed beast
That writhed and wriggled
‘Happy Birthday, Pete!
Another year older, eh?’
‘I never expected a thing
I don’t know what to say.’
Harry couldn’t look at the way
Pete held Becky’s hands
Still he passed him a beer and said
‘Well, there you go, big man.’

‘Harry, this is Ron
Ron, this is Harry, my brother
You guys should really talk to one another
Ron runs the caff and
Harry’s starting up a place up of his own if he can.’
They raised their glasses up
‘Good to meet you, Ron.’
‘Ah, pleasure’s all mine.’
Ron looks into Harry’s eyes and recognises how they shine
Harry. He says the name to himself
Before he’s led away and introduced to someone else

‘Becky, this is Dale,’
Pete’s drunk now, warm inside
Dale’s awkward with a sort of
Distorted and cautious pride on his face
‘Actually, we’ve met’
‘Really? I’m sorry,’ says Becky
‘Don’t pretend that you forgot me already?’
‘Where’d you meet?’ says Pete
Big smile, white teeth
‘She was working, you remember
It was you that made me ring her?’
It hits Pete, like a fist
Where every finger wears a ring
He couldn’t blink or breathe or think or anything

‘Yeah, you remember?
The twenty-third of November
I met you in the Hotel Hacienda
We had a couple drinks
You knew the bartender
You had a Whisky Sour
And I had a Monumenta

We went up in the lift
They was playing Enya
That made you laugh
You said that Enya sent ya round the bend
Pete was scared that you’d been sleeping with men
So he asked me to investigate
Now, in your defense
You was very professional
I was very tense
But I have to say my favorite part
Was the Happy End.’

Ron was in the toilets, washing his hands
When he heard what sounded like a man
Sniffing a whole gram
In one go
Harry walked out of the cubicle, ‘Oh!
Alright, Ron?’
Ron tapped his nose
‘You ain’t got a spare line?’
Harry smiled, ‘No sweat.’
Handed him the wrap and said, ‘I’m going for a cigarette
I’ll meet you at the bar, mine’s a pint of Sea View.’
Ron only had to look at the coke
And he knew

She was dumbstruck
She could feel herself going numb
Clutched thumbs in her fists
Felt unstuck
‘This is wrong!
Fuck this!’
Her stomach heaved
‘You set me up
Instead of just talking to me?
What about trust?’
Guts twisted
Pete was stuck to the spot, his lips shifted
He couldn’t make a sound

Dale stood still, calm
Pete stared dumb
Reached out, touched her arm

She shook it off
So livid, so hurt
She walked away without saying another word
He was about to follow
But saw Dale hiding a smile
Then he couldn’t help it
He saw red, he went wild

‘Alright, look, son
I know we’ve come to have a party
So have a couple of drinks
And a dance with your auntie
But hear this
Let’s clear this up right now
Your numbers are up, son
I have found you out

You don’t know who I work for
Men who have hurt more
Men than the world wars
When you were first born
They were killing men who were worth more
Than ten of your kind
Are you out of your mind?

Look, don’t worry, son
I’m in no hurry, son
I’ll have you on the run
Like a funny curry, son
Go back inside and make sure
Your brother’s having fun
Just know this:
Any day now, I’ll be coming son.’

Becky ran out to the street feeling weak
She took a breath

Heart slamming its head against the wall of her chest
She looked to her left
Saw Ron, shoulders squared
Talking to Harry
Harry looked awkward, scared

‘What’s this, mother’s meeting?
Come on, Harry, need your help.’
She walked him off as Ron watched
Harry felt himself melt
‘Becky,’ he began
But he couldn’t finish
He fiddled with a cigarette
Held it between his fingers
‘What’s up?’
She didn’t need to ask, she could feel it there
‘You got yourself in trouble with my Uncle?’
‘Yeah’

He stared at the skyline
He tried find the right words
‘I gotta leave town
And tonight at the latest.’
They stopped walking, turned
Looked into each other’s faces
‘And I want you to come with me.’
Time stopped
Harry waited

She said nothing
She raised her eyebrows
Like he did on the night they met
In this way they spoke at length
And his heart heard what her eyes said

He said nothing
He just felt and hoped that he was understood
Then she felt something in her melt
And lightening flashed and thunder shook

He stared at her until she heard him
Felt an energy go surging through her person
Something in his eyes
She felt her body bursting

She kissed him
And it reached a part of her that had been sleeping
And she felt his heart beating in her own
She felt complete and so known

They didn’t speak
Ran down the street
Leon had the motor running
And they jumped in the back seat
Becky felt peace when she looked at his face
‘Lets us three get on a plane and open up Harry’s Place’
He stared at her, ‘Really?’
She nodded, his pulsed raced
He reached down beside him
Brought out a suitcase
Stuffed full of cash
Leon smiled at them both
‘Let’s fucking do it,’ He said
Away they drove

Dale and Pete
Were in a pile of trainers and feet
Clenched fists and black eyes and chipped teeth
Their dads had tried
To get in-between them
It was like they couldn’t wait to get involved
Graham was beating David’s skull with his elbows
David was kneeing Graham’s nether regions
And Miriam was at the bar weeping
Ron was pleased as punch
With the outcome of the evening
While Becky, Harry and Leon headed for the beyond

Off to Dover for the ferry
And from there, wherever
Harry looked at Becky
‘Let’s feel this way forever?’

Off to Dover for the ferry
And from there, wherever
Harry looked at Becky, said
‘Let’s feel this way forever!’",Happy End,2014
Kate Tempest,"It’s midnight in the metropolis
Winter is coming
Harry’s in the hallway
Counting out his money
Leon’s in the kitchen
Sharpening knives
The moonlight whispers
In the dark of the skies

Leon and Harry
Friends since before they could say the word ‘friend’
Two sides of the same coin
Two-man industry, they play it very cool
Harry’s got the plans, Leon’s got the heavy tools
Sell at high price to discerning clientele
But tonight Harry’s worried, though
‘Cause Leon’s high as hell
With an unfamiliar glimmer in his eye
Looks like it might be a difficult night

You’ve got to take it as it comes
You’ve got to do what you’ve got to do
Until you get it done
You’ve got to know what you’re in it for
And don’t stop ‘til you got what you’re living for

It’s horrible in Paradise
Harry’s at the bar, sipping lager
Leon’s in the corner with a Pina Colada
And two girls, Rachel and Renata
Keeping one eye on Harry
And the other on the dancefloor

Sounds of laughter
Harry stares ahead of him
The guy standing next him
Turns to him and he says to him:
‘I’m a friend of Pico’s, I heard you need the medicine’
Harry looks him up and down, like
I don’t like the stench of him
Without saying anything, Harry’s on his feet
Walking to the back room, trying to look discreet

The guy that he’s following is flabby round the middle
Wearing a blue suit, pink tie, new boots
Slick hair to the side, little ‘tache
And he walks with a limp
He talks with a sort of distorted lisp
Leon’s on his feet, staying hidden
As they step into the back room, he slips in with them

You’ve got to take it as it comes
You’ve got to do what you’ve got to do
Until you get it done
You’ve got to know what you’re in it for
And don’t stop ‘til you got what you’re living for
You’ve got to take it as it comes
You’ve got to do what you’ve got to do
Until you get it done
You’ve got to know what you’re in it for
And keep on, even when it all goes wrong

The guy says, ‘Call me Joey
This here is my place
I’m the King to Pico’s Ace
And I hope for your sake mate that you ain’t no joker.’
Harry says nothing
Joey beckons to the sofa

They sit either side of a glass-topped tank
There’s a baby shark inside, about a metre long
The room is dim lit and the walls are blank
Joey says, ‘Now we both know that Pico’s gone
Away for a little while
Before he left, he said you was a good guy
No funny business.’
Joey takes a package from the chest by the desk
And he puts it on the tank and
His eyes shine vicious and cold
Now he’s pouring out a brandy
Saying, ‘This is premium quality
Do you understand me?
Since Pico’s departure, the prices have risen
It’s double what it used to be
Ok?’

Sitting there quietly
Harry opens up his suitcase
‘I’ll pay you what I paid him.’
Joey smiles like his tooth aches
All lop-sided and strange
He says, ‘You’ll pay me what I ask for
Or you walk away with nothing
You know full well
It’s the best coke in the country
You either deal with me or your customers go hungry
What’s the matter, Harry? You look a little jumpy
Cat got your tongue or something?’

Leon’s watching from the corner
Wondering if he’s bluffing
Joey’s waiting
Harry’s saying, ‘No
No negotiating.’
Joey says: ‘It’s more pure
Than what you’ve had before
This is straight off the boat
No joke
Where’s the notes?’

In a breath, Leon’s out from his hiding place
Steel toes, hurricane hands, calm face
Joey drops suddenly
Like a kid with his first pill
Harry’s at the stash
Getting the cash
Leon works ‘til
Joey’s just a pattern in the carpet
Harry shakes his head and puts the package in his jacket
‘What?’ says Leon
‘Ain’t worth doing nothing half-hearted.’
Harry buttons his coat and tries to settle his
Panic

You’ve got know what you’re in it for
And keep on, right?
Even when it all goes wrong?",The Heist,2014
Kate Tempest,"Pete is young man
Heart full of rain
Eyes full of evenings
Spent in a dream
Grew up in a city where you master your pain
Or you end up numb, not feeling

Becky is a young woman
Heart full of earth
Eyes full of mornings
Spent without sleeping
Grew up in a city where it’s hard to be heard
And nothing really has much meaning

Pete had his heart broke once. He never fixed it
Sits there in his chest
With his arms crossed, screwing
Becky had her heart broke twice She won’t risk it again
She don’t wanna see her heart get ruined

And now she’s on her way
To wash up and take the orders For spaghetti
At Giuseppe’s
The café on the corner
She did the night shift too
A masseuse at the sauna
She’s putting herself through uni It’s hard work

But will it be this way forever?
These are lonely days
What if she could be the one that makes it better?
He looks away, can’t hold her gaze
But will it be this way forever?
These are stressful times
What if he could be the one that gets her?
She looks away, she’s petrified

‘Now, have you thought about retail?’
‘Yes, fine with me’
‘Oh and I can see here that you have a degree’
‘Yes,’ says Pete, ‘in International Relations.’
‘Great
Let’s see if Primark has space for a placement.’

Becky clears up from the lunch rush Crushed
By the blank eyes
Impolite customers thrusting
Their damp fives
Into her palms, she thinks
There ain’t no harm in being civil though, Is there?

He folds up his job form
Gets up from his chair
The next person sits down with a similar air Of dejection
He walks out, heads in the direction
Of the café on the corner
For a coffee and some headroom

This guy comes in
The first customer to close the door behind him For that alone she likes him
He sits at the table by the window
Reading, half smiling
His hair’s messy and his eyes are shining

Can’t think what to say, he just stares blankly
Picks up his change, fiddles with his spoon
And as he leaves the café he’s consumed
With thoughts of her
Wishing that he’d got up the guts
To try and talk to her

But will it be this way forever?
These are lonely days
What if she could be the one that makes it better?

It’s Becky’s mate’s birthday They’re out for the night
Now, Becky’s mate is the nightmare type
She’ll flirt with anyone
Scream at the top of her voice
But it’s her birthday so Becky
Don’t really have a choice

He sees her in the queue
He doesn’t know what to do
She’s more beautiful than he remembers Then she says
‘Alright?’
And he tries to say something funny
But stutters
And now he feels like a muppet and blushes (No, No, No)

Inside it’s the usual scene
They’re dancing at the bar, waiting to get served
Becky’s mate’s screaming about something absurd
And they’re all fake laughing
Even though nobody heard a word

So now he’s hunting around the room
Staring into every booth
The back of every head could be hers It’s no use
He stops by the bar, thinking
Man, I’ll never find her
And then he realises that he’s standing beside her

He stands there awkward
His eyes are as loud as the bass
And she can recognise something in his face
She scribbles down her number
Lingering glance
And lets herself think
Maybe this could be her chance

But will it be this way forever?

Kate Tempest,"Everywhere is monsters
Tits out, wet-mouthed, heads back
Shouting and screaming just to prove they exist

Becky’s at the bar with the usual mix
Of decadent fabrics and desolate lighting
Everybody here has got a hyphenated second name
Blowing more breeze
Than the wind at the weather vane

Industry slimeballs, showbiz big-deals
The cool new band with the retro feel
It’s the wrap party for their video
Becky danced in it
The director, Marshall Law
Head to toe in yellow velour
Is holding court about the science of image
While the sycophants giggle and grimace
Becky fidgets, tells herself
‘Must stop being so cynical
Everybody here is a human
Even these pitiful posturing pop stars and idiots.’
She tells herself to look again -
Nothing is hideous

So while Marshall Law is wanking on about his artwork
She smiles at the guy opposite
Bright eyes, dark shirt
He raises his eyebrows in the direction of Marshall
‘My name’s Becky,’ she says
‘What’s yours?’

She was like nothing that he’d seen before
Strong body, soft edges, with something so raw
In the core of her iris
He said his name, ‘Harry’
And never in his life had he felt so happy
They got talking
Free bar. Exhausting decorum
He drank until she was so absorbing
He blanked out the party
The floor spun, he stared at her face and felt sure
Something was happening here

He was kinda nervous
His eyes kept doing circuits of the room
He drank as fast as they could serve him
Then this dude comes over
Sticks out a thick hand
And Harry looks at her
Like he’s just found himself in quicksand
He gives this guy a wrap, they shake hands
Sweaty cash passed between palms
No fuss. Bish bash, yes, bosh
He looked at her guiltily
She waved it off, smiling
‘You a shotter then, right?
I don’t care.’

‘Becky, all I ever wanted was a place of my own.’
His eyes, wide and trusting
He’s staring at her, desperate for something to click
He is opening up. This is it
‘A real classy place, the whole bit
Like a speakeasy, right?
Chandeliers and lights
That shine off of the glasses
No hype, and no arseholes
Instead of rotting our guts out
In shitty old boozers
We can be grown men, listening to music
Real music. Played with heart by real bands
Not just posers looking like they’re
Giving blowjobs to mic stands
And I’ll be in a waistcoat, dead grand
Harry’s Place
Or, at least, that’s the plan.’

She was half listening
Half not listening
Kept getting distracted by the lights flickering
He looks like an outline that needs filling in
He leans in close, starts whispering:

‘The thing is, and it’s weird
I never felt so able
To talk like this to anybody, ever
Recently Becky, I’ve been really feeling the pressure
I can’t tell you how good it is
To get this off my chest.’

Becky’s holding tight to her glass
Good coke, brain fast
She watches his face as he talks
Little bump on her fingertips
Expert. Quick snort
Sucking on a cigarette, feeling vaguely bored

It’s true if you believe it
The world is the world
But it’s all how you see it
One man’s flash of lightning ripping through the air
Is another’s passing glare, hardly there
It’s true if you believe it

But it’s all how you see it
One man’s flash of lightning ripping through the air
Is another’s passing glare, hardly there

‘If I’m being honest, well it is
It’s like a trap
I ain’t trying to be flash
I just need to raise the cash for the dream
I hardly touch it myself
Look, it ain’t that
But once I set myself a task
Well, there ain’t no going back
And I am halfway there
I am, nearly, anyway
The point is
I kinda had to push all of my friends away
I can’t have nobody
Knowing what I’m up to
I keep it very secret but the thing is
I would love to
Just for one day
You know, live like any other guy
I can’t have a girlfriend, you see
‘Cause I don’t like to lie
It’s safer all round
That I just keep my head down
And, yeah, the business is booming
Yeah, the business is really booming
But my family think I work in recruitment
So, I get up every morning
And I put a shirt and suit on
And I get on a train, I go up town
It’s all professional users
I sell in the boardrooms and not the boozers
To, like, CEOs and these modern day Scrooges
Who get their secretaries to bring me coffee
It’s so stupid
Meant to be hard times, right, a recession?
But these guys are buying more than ever, I reckon
And I…

He’s got nice eyes
Shame about his issues, though
The party pushes on, her cynicism’s getting vicious
Show nothing
Keep smiling

She catches the eye of her mates
They’re dancing by the bar
They’re in a state
Nod for ‘save me’
They understand, dance over
Put their arms around her shoulders -
‘Becky, we’re bored, let’s go’
His mouth slows to a stop
He seems to lose his composure
She smiles at him
‘Yeah, was nice getting to know ya.’

No, not like that, don’t leave
Please
Don’t make her go, we’ve just got started

Their teeth are bare, their feet are planted
Their smirking at him like he’s dirt
And now his heart is
Damp with the fury of
Finding and losing
This miracle girl
He feels weak with confusion, like
What had he said?
How long had he talked?
He watches them walk to the doors
His blood roars

In the back of the cab, the girls sit there giggling
The driver lets them smoke out of the window
So they’re shivering
They pass a bottle of wine back and forth
Let it clash against their teeth
The cab moves fast through the streets
‘Who was that guy you was with?’
Becky shakes her head softly
‘Him? I don’t know, probably alright
But I could tell he was one of them “save me” types
And I couldn’t be dealing with that
Not tonight.’",Marshall Law,2014
Kate Tempest,"‘It feels like we could make something happen
That ain’t ever happened before.’
‘Let’s never get bored
Of each other.’
‘And let’s always want more
Of each other.’

They lay on the floor with each other
Amazed by how right it felt
They smiled and they caught their breath
And they thought of nothing else

They lay there silent
Not touching
She’s crying
Backs to each other
And he’s sighing
Three days straight fighting
‘I can’t bear your self-importance.’
‘I don’t like you when you’re like this.’
‘You haven’t even kissed me for days’
‘How can I want to kiss you
When all your lips say
Is how shitty I’ve been and how little I care?’
‘What are we doing this for?’
‘I can’t bear any more of your bitching.’
They sit there in the kitchen
They didn’t look at each other
They just stared at the walls
And her head’s in her hands
And the coffee pot falls to the floor
Now he is angry and smashing up tables

He was thinking:

‘If I love you like I say
I would not treat you this way
If I love you like I think
I would not make such a stink

If this is what we had both hoped
I don’t think I’d feel so choked
If I want more, how can I get it?
I’m only staying ‘cause I’m scared
If I leave I’ll regret it.’

Pete is at home, Becky is at work
He stares out the window
Trying not to let it hurt
He folds up the washing
He watches a bit of telly
And he makes himself some dinner
But he can’t eat any
He knows it’s her job and that she is working hard
But the thought of what she does kind of rips him apart
And every time they talk about it, it just turns into a row
She says ‘If you trust me, I don’t see how
This can be a problem,’
And he can’t find the words to say -
I don’t want your hands
On another man’s vertebrae

He don’t have a leg to stand on
He ain’t earning
And she’s got rent to pay
And books to buy
She is determined
To support herself
But he looks at his girlfriend
And feels like
He is in love with a whirlwind
She rips him to pieces every night
And every morning
He finds himself doubting things
That used to be important

He drifted from his mates and he lost contact with his brother
All they really had now was each other
Eventually he gave in, he said
‘If you think it’s right
Then go ahead and work
But please don’t work tonight.’

Then she said:

‘If you love me like you say
You would not push me away
If you love me like you think
You would not make such a stink
If this is what we had both hoped
I don’t think that we’d feel so choked

The tablecloths shine with wear
The chairs are threadbare
But look happy to be sitting there

It’s the end of her shift
Her Uncle Ron’s at the counter
Drinking a Gin Fizz
It’s his place, he gave her the work
He’s like a dad to her
For better or worse
For now, he stabs at a lemon rind with a toothpick
‘What’s the matter, Ron,’ Becky says
‘Are you sick?’
He shakes his head, says ‘Troubles I got…’
And she waits for more
Focusing on a spot
On the top of his head
She ain’t noticed before
But suddenly her Uncle Rags
Comes strutting through the door
Becky sees that this means business
Some things she ain’t supposed to know
Ron smiles at her with thin lips
‘Right,’ says Becky, ‘time I go.’

Why?
‘Cause he leaves bodies in tatters

His voice is soft
‘Some junior, Joey, trying to play boss
Thought he could run a scam

Whatever, a small cost to find a snake in the grass
And, yeah, Pico ain’t happy

We think the kid’s called Harry
But we might be wrong.’

‘So we’re looking for him, yeah?’
‘Well, we were but it all got hot
You know, Pico’s inside
Too much eyes, so we stopped
Cut your losses
But the bosses
Would prefer some bodies

I get my jollies
Just sitting down fishing
Yeah, It’s good to have a hobby
Keeps you on your toes
When your knees are getting wobbly.’

‘So after all that,’
Ron breathes out stale air
‘There’s no fucking panic?!’
Rags gets up. ‘Take care mate
I got a date with a lady in Mayfair
Put your knives away
And let them stay there.’

One flame, many cinders

Is it the things that you claim to be true
Or is it deeper?
Lurking in places that you
Don’t dare to journey to
Faced with a new
Way of seeing it
Are you type to accept
Or the type to clench fists and reject?

Whose truth even counts?
Is it the person who doubts
What a person proclaims they’re about?
Whose version is perfect?
Is there a truth that exists
Outside of perception?

Two thinks One’s plain evil

You’re so pure that you should not touch me.’
Two said
‘I don’t care, I love you
I can’t wait to know you.’
One said
‘I’m scared, I will show you
The bad side that I don’t like.’
Two said
‘Be yourself and I will be myself

With their opinions
The past is gone, let’s move on
Make present.’
Two said
‘Ok, you’re the best.’
Well, you know the rest
It all went sour

And now Two thinks One is mad for power
One thinks Two tried to devour
Everything that made One One

That must bring us closer together

To feel tender

Who have never been held in their lives
Eight months in a boardroom
Three on the motorway
One in a small room
Watching the dawn loom large over grey bricks
It’s not sordid, it’s sacred
To open them up to the warmth
Of her nature; it’s ancient
She don’t wanna do it forever
But let’s face it
Wages are fucked
And rent is outrageous
Some might say that she’s being degraded

Knows her own morals

Working for peanuts and making them conkers

His name was Pete and while she was at work
He got stoned and watched snooker
And when she got home he cooked food for them both

Unravelling all that he knew to be true

He’s the type to say, ‘This is reality’
He finds it very hard to alter his view
But, gradually
She has felt less and less certain
That his understanding would stretch
And now she’s got to justify all her decisions
But he doesn’t listen, just gets upset
But she, in her wisdom, is ready to try
She thinks of his feelings
She kisses his neck in the evenings
Tells him, for them she’s a sweet thing
In-between meetings
But he has her depth and the whole of her

But when he’s holding her hand
It feels less like her hand
And more like his hand
And when he’s kissing her face
It feels less like her face
And more like his face

She’s become displaced
Is she herself?
Or is she the girl that he wants her to be?
She tells him, ‘I don’t want to hurt you
But your judgements are heavy
And they’re hurting me’

Desolate apostles, left with Strongbow at the crossroads
We are nothing but an eating mouth, oesophagus, colossal
We won't stop until we've beaten down the planet into pellets
Before the interstellar mission to inflict more terror
It's killing me, it's killing me, it's filling me, I'm vomiting, it's still in me
Everything is fine really, silly me
Poor kids shot dead, poor kids locked up
Poor kids saying, “This is the future that you left us?”
Stopped up lunch meat, processed, punch from an unclean fatcat
Tasty, tasty poison
Carcinogenic, diabetic, asthmatic, epileptic, post-traumatic, bipolar and disaffected
Atomised, thinking we're engaged when we're pacified
Staring at the screen so we don't have to see the planet die

What we gonna do to wake up?
We sleep so deep, it don't matter how they shake us
If we can't face it, we can't escape it
But tonight the storm's come

She's screaming, she's screaming
The drones turned her beautiful boy into a pile of bones
No body to bury, nobody is home
Running from war, the boat's full, the boat's sinking a mile off shore
No beds in the hospitals, our minds are against us
Imagine your daughter was gunned down defenceless on her way to school
There'd be uproar
But she's collateral damage, it doesn't matter
Now if our kids are fine, that's enough for us
You can't love into a vacuum, there's got to be a limit
Welcome to the biggest crime that's ever been committed
You think you and I are different kinds, you're caught up in specifics
You and I apart are easier to limit
The illusion's so complete it's impossible to bring it into focus
Cinematic stock footage, you think people are locusts
Uniform men keep unleashing explosives

What we gonna do to wake up?
We sleep so deep, it don't matter how they shake us
If we can't face it, we can't escape it
But tonight the storm's come

Tunnel vision, tunnel vision
Work, drinks, heartbreak
You can't face the past, the past's a dark place
Can't sleep, can't wake, sitting in our boxes
Notching up our victories as other people's losses
Another day, another chance to turn your face away from pain
Let's get a takeaway
And meet me in the pub a little later, we'll say the same things as ever
Life's a waiting game
When we gonna see that life is happening?
And that every single body bleeding on its knees is an abomination
And every natural being is making communication
And we're just sparks, tiny parts of a bigger constellation
We're miniscule molecules that make up one body
You see the tragedy and pain of a person that you've never met
Is present in your nightmares, in your pull towards despair
And the sickness of the culture, and the sickness in our hearts
Is a sickness that's inflicted by this distance that we share
Now, it was our bombs that started this war
And now it rages far away
So we dismiss all its victims as strangers
But they're parents and children made dogs by the danger
Existence is futile, so we don't engage
But it was our boats that sailed, killed, stole, and made frail
It was our boots that stamped
It was our courts that jailed
And it was our fuckin' banks that got bailed
It was us who turned bleakly away
Looked back down at our nails and our wedding plans
In the face of a full-force gale, we said
“Well, it's not up to us to make this place a better land
It's not up to us to make this place a better land”
Justice, justice, recompense, humility
Trust is, trust is something we will never see
Till love is unconditional
The myth of the individual has left us disconnected, lost, and pitiful
I'm out in the rain
It's a cold night in London
And I'm screaming at my loved ones to wake up and love more
I'm pleading with my loved ones to wake up and love more",Tunnel Vision,2016
Kate Tempest,"Give me your guts, deliver them up
It was half-past nothing and the river was blood
The city shrugged, we closed our eyes, stepped back into our huts
As if it meant nothing to us

Come on, give me your palm and a bucket of Khan
Hold me closer on the sofas sleeping under your arm
They say that slumber will harm
But I am under your charm
So keep it going never know when we'll be sober to start

Give me them thundering darks
Give me them hungers that've been coming apart so long
It's a wonder that we still want to dance
But here we are in the humbling dark
Throwing shapes while the hunters advance

Come on, give me your chance
Where the eyes might find
Opposition left her wishing she was mine all mine
And not first night until the eyes go blind
We're entwined

Oh, but in the morning they all leave us behind

Come on, give me your guts, man, deliver them up
You say you're searching for something but the sympathy's stuck
So come on, give me your guts, man, deliver them up
There's no villainy big enough that you can't kill it with love
Come on, give me your guts - deliver them up
You know you're looking above, but you're living for love
Come on, give me your guts, man deliver them up
Skimming the surface but it isn't enough
No, it isn't enough

Give me a smile let me kick it around
It was something I found in the road
The night's coming down
He gives like a toad
He's just looking for a princess to love him
But all the princesses think he's just disgusting
You can beat him up but can't budge him
I was in Budgens, picking up a can with my cousin
And I saw him bent double by the dustbins
Retching up a puddle of guts, people
Wanted to help but they couldn't bear touch him
The fat prince rolled over, too much
Look, you can kick him down but can't crush him
You can take him home but can't trust him
His heart is a book, his armour is crooked
His arms are the hooks in the mouth of a mermaid he's been harvesting
Shook dry by barbarous lips
He sees the picture but he's hardly a part of it
He's starting to slip

Trust, for him it's harder than it looks
They're holding those riddles
Up in the middle
While others hide in their books
Every cranny every nook
Backing up what they could
Storming alleys in their valleys happy with what they took
From what they're given
Locks their living
Holding dogs they're sniffing
Floorboards lifting up
In every flat they're slotting all the difficult decisions
He's used to it
Bruises for proof of it
Fuses shot he didn't use until his uses
Until he's blot where Gruesomes live
Truth of it
Abusive kid
Simply wanted shoes to fit
His hands would understand there's a grand if you move this shit
Sniffing white powder
Burning through the light hours
Getting light, losers getting tight
Couldn't lose his grip
Soon he did, slipped and slept where the kid was kept
Took the deepest breath of his ex, said

""I'm deep in debt""

Steep regret, cos he died like his brother
When all he wanted to do was provide for his mother

So, give me your guts, man, deliver them up
There's more to the world than the things you can touch
Give me your guts, man, deliver them up
Funny feeling in your lungs
But the sympathy's strung
So come on, give me your guts, man, deliver them up
Now I'm trying to go the distance but I keep getting stuck
Man, give me your guts, come, deliver them up
You sit, sipping the wisdom till you're feeling the calm

Give me a reason, the reason is long gone
Even the feeling I want one is wrong
And every evening when I feel it come on
I start to laugh, start singing the song

Singing the song, look give me a reason
The reason is long gone
And even the feeling that I want one is wrong
And every evening when I feel it come on
I start to laugh, start singing the song, give me your guts
Come on deliver (come on deliver) them up
Give me your guts, man, deliver them up",Guts,2016
Kate Vikstrom,"Cathedral bells were tolling
and our hearts sang on
Was it the spell of Paris,
or the April dawn?
Who knows if we shall meet again
but when the morning chimes
ring sweet again

I'll be seeing you
In all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces
All day through

In that small cafe
The park across the way
The children's carousel
The chestnut tree
The wishing well

I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you

I'll be seeing you

But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You,
Kate Vikstrom,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,
Kate Voegele,"I stop to catch my breath
And I stop to catch your eye
No need to second-guess
That you've been on my mind
I dream days away, but that's okay
It's like I want to hear a silent sound
And then hold it in my hand
But a rose won't blossom from a ground
Of desert sand, but I like to pretend that

One day I'll turn around
I'll see your hand reach out
I'm only fooling myself, oh,
But maybe when you smile
It means you'd stay awhile
Just maybe you'd save me now

Well, now it's etched in stone
That I can't survive alone
You have the missing piece
That I need so desperately
Yes, I slip away to a day that'll never come
It's like a splash of water to my face
When I suddenly realize
That you could never find a place
For me in your eyes, and I don't know why I keep thinking

One day I'll turn around
I'll see your hand reach out
I'm only fooling myself, oh,
But maybe when you smile
It means you'd stay awhile
Just maybe you'd save me now

It's love in disguise
I'm lost in your eyes
I'm lost in your eyes

One day I'll turn around
I'll see your hand reach out
I'm only fooling myself, oh,
But maybe when you smile
It means you'd stay awhile
Just maybe you'd save me now

Save me now
Just maybe you'd save me now",Only Fooling Myself,2003
Kate Voegele,"I can't decide
Why you hide what's inside
I've disappeared from your eyes
Never mind, cause I'm leaving you behind 
Don't pretend
You don't know who I am
You don't understand
Can you tell me again?

Why do I cling to things like you
When you'll only break me again?
What in the world do I see in you
Standing on the other side of the mountain?

Now, I know
I can go out and show
You just how I'll hold
Myself up on my own
Though your shadow will follow
So won't you leave me here
Alone to stare down below
At you in the cold?

Why do I cling to things like you
When you'll only break me again?
What in the world do I see in you
Standing on the other side of the mountain?

Take everything
And rip at the seams
So I can be free, set me free
Why do I cling to things like you
When you'll only break me again?

Standing on the other side of the mountain?
I can't decide why you hide on the other side",The Other Side,2003
Kate Voegele,"Out of the corner
Of my tired eyes
I'm not surprised
That it's now a quarter past too late
Nothing new, it's no case out of the ordinary
I'm so very wrapped around your finger this time
Oh, won't you give me awhile to unwind?

You're on top of the world
And I'm just waiting, making up your excuse
You say that love's tough, are you sure? 
Ain't it just a piece of cake to make me look like a fool?
I look like a fool

You're like a splinter
Just killing me slowly from inside
The piercing winter is so much
More inviting than the stare in your eyes
One heavy cinderblock, like a rock
You're just staying, weighing, breaking me down
I'm crying out, you don't hear a sound

You're on top of the world
And I'm just waiting, making up your excuse
You say that love's tough, are you sure? 
Ain't it just a piece of cake to make me look like a fool?
I look like a fool

Hope I've lost enough to win you back your prize 
To put you up sky high, get your pride back to its familiar place
And I hope it's cost enough of my dear, precious time
To lift your spirits, spark your smile

You're on top of the world
And I'm just waiting, making up your excuse
You say that love's tough, are you sure? 
Ain't it just a piece of cake to make me look like a fool?
I look like a fool

You break me, make me look like a fool
I am not your fool, no, no
You may be on top of the world
But I'm done playing by your rules 
You're on top of the world",Top of the World,2003
Kate Voegele,"I use no exaggeration
I'm plainly hanging by a thread
And I'm running low on patience
But don't go blame it on yourself

I wish that I was in my right mind
But I've left myself unnecessary chores
I make it bad when it's just fine
I was whole and sure and now I'm clearly torn, 'cause there's

[Chorus]
Nothin' left for me to do
Right and left both bring me to
The center of my deepest fear
Where the truth is oh so clear
Embracing inescapable truth
And that's Facing Up to You
And truth is so cruel

Continual irresolution
Keeps me shackled to the ground
And I've been in dire need of revolution
For far too many days to count
I thought I was safe in the Hiding Place
But it sure is exhausting, livin' in chains
It's paradoxical in every way
Nothin' makes sense
I can't tell love from hate...and there's

[Chorus]

I'm beggin' myself to make something of it
I give up still unable to comprehend
My own true will...

Facing Up to You",Facing Up,2005
Kate Voegele,"As high as the moon
So high were my spirits
When you sang out my name

And coming from you
It was enough just to hear it
Oh, it rang like the bells did today

But even the sturdiest ground
Can shift and can tremble and let us fall down?

Kindly unspoken
You show your emotion
And silence speaks louder than words
It's lucky I'm clever
Cause if I didn't know better
I'd believe only that which I'd heard

In the days of my folly
I followed your rules
Did what Simon Says to do

But I won't let melancholy
Play me for a fool
Oh, no I'm on my way somewhere new

And as far as your lack of something to say
Well, to tell me goodbye there was no better way

Kindly unspoken
You show your emotion
And silence speaks louder than words
It's lucky I'm clever
Cause if I didn't know better
I'd believe only that which I'd heard

So don't keep me up till the dawn
With words that'll keep leading me on
I know much better than to wait for an answer from you

Kate Voegele,"Far in the distance
This is the view from the other side
How did I let this pass me by?
You took me from granted,
Blended thorns in this garden of mine
What are the chances my hope has died?
Didn't have mercy
You unnerved me
I don't deserve this pain, no

So don't break my heart
I ain't never done
Nothing to deserve this

Do you suppose I earned it?
Do you not see

Those were days dark as ebony nights

To prove me right

Your character is that contagious
I know I should have thought before I had done
I've gone and let my impulse be my guide
And on that note I'll be defenseless for some time

I'm moving in reverse
Under your mighty curse
I hate myself for loving you
I turn my head away

Don't you come around here
Don't test my patience baby

That it's more than a friendly game

You think I'm so dramatic;
Just imagining again
You come to her defense
Insisting that she's innocent
Well excuse me for wanting to be
The one and only lock that fits your key
Oh you believe there's nothing up her sleeve
Oh baby, well just wait and see

You say that love is blind

She'd cheat and lie to get you to love her
Who's the victim if it doesn't make a difference now?
I'll be gone one way or another

Take a minute to see it from my side of things
Don't you think you would feel the same?
Like you still gotta play for the victory in a game
You won yesterday
I shouldn't have to fight for something that's already mine
But her pursuit of you has under-mind my peace of mind
But it's no use crying to you
You're who her plan has done the damage to
What's done is done
I should just hold my tongue

She's making you a prisoner for her hall of fame
She's looking for a winner for her trophy case
And you need to consider
What you think you deserve
Is that all that you're worth?
No, no, no, no

Just a page in my diary
So here I am a Utopian citizen
Still convinced
There's no such thing as idealism

And I'm dreamin'
And I've already suffered the fever of disbelief

And I know all the facts
I'm still in love with who I wish you were

It ain't hard to see
Who you are underneath
I'm still in love with who I wish you were

And I wish you were here

I was true as the sky is blue
I couldn't soon say the same for you
So now I find denial in my eyes
I'm mesmerized by the picture that's in my mind

Tell me when I'll finally see your shallow heart
For what it is
'Cause I don't want to keep on believin' in illusions

David played and it pleased the lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?

Well it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall
And the major lift,
The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing up on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you.

And she tied you her kitchen chair
She broke your throne
She cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Well baby I have been here before
I've seen this room, and I've walked this floor
You know I used to live alone before I knew ya.

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do ya?

And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Well maybe there's a god above
But all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you.

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light

Impossible means nothing to me, yeah

So can you lift me up,
Turn the ashes into flames
'Cause I have overcome
More than words will ever say
And I've been given hope

Somewhere, every body starts there
I'm counting on a small prayer,
Lost in a nightmare
But I'm here, and suddenly it's so clear

It taught me to outrun my fears

Everything worth having, oh
Comes with trials worth withstanding

Let's get ourselves outta town
We'll take the last train out
I got a million things I wanna know
It's easy baby with us there's nowhere we can't go
And this love it doesn't scare me
'Cause running out of reasons not to feel this
I can tell you're dying to try

[Chorus]

Well don't you wonder what it'd feel
Underneath the streetlights
You and me, oh
With the city wrapped around us
If no one ever found us
It's fine with me

So no one's gonna love you like I will
Darlin' you just take take take your time

Kate Voegele,"I want a violet bicycle, flip flops and sand between my toes
These are the beautiful things in life
So give me that off the shoulder dress
The one that the boys will not forget
Well, I want just a little bit more from life

Maybe I should pack my bags and fly to Costa Rica
Put a flower in my hair, a dancing senorita

Oh put a little sunshine in my sky
Oh what a lovely day to be alive
These eyes are longing to see a sign of summer
To leave my cares in the breeze
Oh put a little sunshine in my sky

So let's go skinny dip tonight
Under the cotton candy skies
Would you if I asked you?
A campfire and a backyard ballgame
Fireflies and electric lemonade
And I can't keep my eyes off you

We could pack our bags and fly to Costa Rica
You could swing me low and call me Rosalita, yeah yeah

Oh put a little sunshine in my sky
Oh what a lovely day to be alive
These eyes are longing to see a sign of summer
To leave my cares in the breeze
Oh put a little sunshine in my sky

Now wouldn't it be nice to know we
Could make a great escape to paradise
'Cause me I'm cold as ice
If you could wrap the sun around me
And lay me down safe and soundly
I would die

Oh put a little sunshine in my sky
Oh what a lovely day to be alive

Leave my cares in the breeze

Help me start again
Moving forward without awkward moves
And I would be brave

And I could leave this goldfish sea
And I could start to believe in me
And after the sun the rain would fall
And I wouldn't mind at all

And if I could just escape this body
I know I wouldn't fake for just anybody
I claw my heart for you and keep it until I was okay
With what I do that's all that I'm after

At every step of the way

'Cause when you get here we can play
Oh, when you get here what will I say?
Oh, when you get here we'll make a day of it
And we'll wonder, is this it?

To think that you're in reach
Goosebumps and all those highs and lows
Will you understand how it feels?

Just to kiss him

Just look in his eyes
They're blue as the skies
Are picture so pretty

And watch him sparkle

When I held your hand, can't forget,
And I saw you smile as it lifted me upwards a mile.
I felt your eyes like a June sun,
As soon as you entered the room, one
Tiniest moment and I was left open.

Open to the magic that you seem to master,
And though my love is tragic you awkwardly answered.

So I said 'be mine, be mine, be my love,
Be mine, be mine, be my love,
Be mine, be mine and I'll be yours.'

So I thought I might take a chance,
When you tried but you couldn't dance,
And when you stepped closer I almost fell over.

Over from the magic that you seem to master,
And though my love is tragic you awkwardly answered.

So I said 'be mine, be mine, be my love,
Be mine, be mine, be my love,
Be mine, be mine and I'll be yours.'

Does it all make sense'

He left me wounded on the sand,
There are no healing hands,
He left an arrow in my heart.

No one else can make the dark silver melt,
Like a sword is in the stone,
It keeps my blood in flow,
To pull it out would turn the lights out.

Quick shards of light on my pillow,
Remind me that I haven?t let go.
I cling on for dear life till he says so.

He signed his name with a burning flame,
All across my bones, my aching shield,
To him alone I yield,
I wished a hundred times I could feel it.

Quick shards of light on my pillow,
Remind me that I haven?t let go.

And guiding me through what he won?t show,
I cling on for dear life till he says so.",I Cling on for Dear Life,2009

With this weight upon my heart

And still this question keeps on spinning in my mind
What if I had never let you go

If I'd stayed
If you'd tried

Some to joy
Some to heart-ache
Anyone can lose their way

Do you think how it would have been sometimes
Do you pray that I'd never left your side

Kate Wolf,"She rises like the dolphin, with the sea wind in her eyes. 
The sunlight casting shadows, like a painter's palette knife
Her hair fans out around her, floating like a crown.
She plays on the water, lets it pull her down.

Sometimes she swims in moonlight with the stars high above. 
The night sounds of the water speaking soft of love.
Her skin turns to velvet as she feels the waters glide. 
She loses all her boundaries on this magic carpet ride.

You see ripples on the water and watch the shadows dance. 
Then she's diving down and you're looking through a glass. 
Like a one way mirror, her reflection's far below. 
Where she was, she isn't now.
That's all you really know.

Two swimmers in the water, one of silver, one of gold. 
One below the surface, one reaching for a hold. 
One floating freely, one tryin' not to drown. 
A dreamer with two faces, a dolphin and a clown.

If you think you'll hold her in a shallow pool, 
catch her in a waterfall, you're thinking like a fool.
She'll strike up the horizon, like a ship out to sea.
Leaving just illusions that look like memories.

She wears the water like a mask, a brand new suit of clothes.
A player on the stage, an actress no one knows. See her roll and tumble, 
falling like a clown. 
A swimmer in the water that flies to higher ground",She Rises Like the Dolphin,1979

Countin' troubles 'stead of countin' sheep 
Where the years went I can't say

Of dusty books and faded papers 
They tell a story I used to know 
And it was one that happened so long ago 

It's gone away in yesterday 
Now I find myself on the mountainside 
Where the rivers change direction 
Across the Great Divide 

Now, I heard the owl a-callin' 
Softly as the night was fallin' 
With a question and I replied 
But he's gone across the borderline 

He's gone away in yesterday 
Now I find myself on the mountainside 
Where the rivers change direction

The finest hour that I have seen 
Is the one that comes between 
The edge of night and the break of day 
It's when the darkness rolls away 

And it's gone away in yesterday

Kate Wolf,"Gray-haired and flint-eyed, his sunburned face lined
Grandpa was a man of few words
He had a way of not wanting to say
Any more than he thought would be heard

The long years of living, day-to-day giving
Had carved out a map on his face
With little to lose, he’d learned how to choose
And his choices were easy to trace

He had the eyes of a painter
Heart of a maker of songs
His words fell like rain on the dry desert plain
Precious and so quickly gone

From a long line of teachers, white Baptist preachers
He was born with an Indian will
His quiet dark eyes, reading the light
As he rode in the low Osage hills

His school was the prairie, the sage, the wild berry
The quail, the wide open sky
The cottonwood thicket by the slow rolling river
The Redbud and the hot cattle drive

He had the eyes of a painter
Heart of a maker of songs
His words fell like rain on the dry desert plain
Precious and so quickly gone

There were days filled with thinking, nights with the drinking
For a lost love that raged like a storm
Oh, but how his eyes smiled, when he’d talk to a child
The rough hands so gentle and warm

His strong arms were brown, where the long sleeves
Rolled down, on his faded blue cotton shirt
When times got hard, he’d go out in the yard
And he'd cuss away some of his hurt

He had the eyes of a painter
Heart of a maker of songs
His words fell like rain on the dry desert plain
Precious and so quickly gone

Now the garden’s grown dusty, hand axe lies rusty
The door’s banging hard in the wind
Grandpa’s store is closed down, like most of the town
And it won’t be open again

And the big white car, sits out in the yard
Of the house he built solid and true
Oh, but I see his eyes, burning tonight
Like the stars in the sky he once knew

He had the eyes of a painter
Heart of a maker of songs
His words fell like rain on the dry desert plain
Precious and so quickly gone

His words fell like rain on the dry desert plain
Precious and so quickly gone

She said child take your time
Don't fall in love too quickly
Before you know the one
She held me round the shoulders
In a voice so soft and kind
She said love can make you happy
And love can rob you blind
Here in California fruit hangs heavy on the vines
There's no gold I thought I'd warn you
And the hills turn brown in the summertime
Now I will learn to love you
But I can't say when
This morning we were strangers
And tonight we're only friends
I'll take the time to know you
I'll take the time to see
There's nothing I won't show you
If you take your time with me 
Here in California fruit hangs heavy on the vines
There's no gold I thought I'd warn you
And the hills turn brown in the summertime


There's a old familiar story
An old familiar rhyme
To everything there is a season
To every purpose there's a time
A time to love and come together
A time when love longs for air ??
A time for questions we can't answer
Though we ask them just the same

There's no gold I thought I'd warn you

That I find lies before me
An open-ended dream
And I don't want to wake
I've crossed so many rivers
In search of crystal fountains
I've found the truest paths
Always lead through mountains
I've seen water on the sky
And fire burning on the lake

Chorus:
You said to me
I cannot make you happy
Like a wounded bird
You must find the strength to fly
Time can paint the tree tops
With colours of the rainbow
But you cannot find the end
No matter how you try

It's a journey with my soul
That I am taking
One that only goes
From the cradle to the grave
Going 'round in circles
Like painted dancing horses
Up and down we ride
On the wooden courses
And light from a lover's eyes
Is all that I can save

Chorus

So I'll take the day and run
Out across the open fields
Where the grass grows high
And the shadows fall
Where my eyes can see
All the colours in the air
So quiet that the wind
Whistles in my hair
And takes the rising dust
And carries it away

Chorus",Unfinished Life,1981
Kate Wolf,"Kind friends all gathered 'round, there's something I would say:
That what brings us together here has blessed us all today.
Love has made a circle that holds us all inside.
Where strangers are as family, loneliness can't hide.

You must give yourself to love if love is what you're after;
Open up your hearts to the tears and laughter
And give yourself to love, give yourself to love.

I've walked these mountains in the rain and learned to love the wind;
I've been up before the sunrise to watch the day begin.
I've always knew I'd find you, though I never did know how;
Like sunshine on a cloudy day stand before me now.

So give yourself to love if love is what you're after;
Open up your hearts to the tears and laughter
And give yourself to love, give yourself to love.

Love is born in fire; it's planted like a seed.
Love can't give you everything, but it gives you what you need.
And love comes when you're ready, love comes when you're afraid;
It'll be your greatest teacher, the best friend you have made.

So give yourself to love if love is what you're after;
Open up your hearts to the tears and laughter
And give yourself to love, give yourself to love.

Give yourself to love if love is what you're after;
Open up your hearts to the tears and laughter
And give yourself to love, give yourself to love",Give Yourself to Love,1983

But this voice keeps whispering
In my other ear, tells me

I may never see you again
'Cause I get a peaceful, easy feeling
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing on the ground
'Cause I'm already standing
On the ground
Ooo, ooo",Peaceful Easy Feeling,1983
Kate Wolf,"A Lilac bush and an Apple tree
Were standing in the woods
Out on the hill above the town, 
Where once a farmhouse stood.

In the winter the leaves are bare
And no one sees the signs
Of a house that stood and a garden that grew
And life in another time.

One Spring when the buds came bursting forth
And grass grew on the land, 
The Lilac spoke to the Apple tree
As only an old friend can.

Do you think, said the Lilac, this might be the year
When someone will build here once more?
Here by the cellar, still open and deep, 
There's room for new walls and a floor.

Oh, no, said the Apple, there are so few
Who come here on the mountain this way
And when they do, they don't often see
Why we're growing here, so far away.

A long time ago we were planted by hands
That worked in the mines and the mills
When the country was young and the people who came
Built their homes in the hills.

But now there are cities, the roads have come
And no one lives here today
And the only signs of the farms in the hills
Are the things not carried away

Broken dishes, piles of boards, 
A tin plate, an old leather shoe.
And an Apple tree still bending down
And a Lilac where a garden once grew.",The Lilac and the Apple,1986
Kate Wolf,"Gentle warrior
With your heart like gold and a rainbow in your eyes
Brave companion
Do you see a world shining in the sky?
With your body dancing like an arrow
Spreading joy beneath your feet
And your hands they wave like tall grass
In the wind as you speak

With the shyness of a small child
And the wisdom of a saint
I tell ya now
There is no reason to be afraid

Brother warrior
There are none of us who walk this path alone
Spirit healer is the only life that we have ever known
I see your smile in the sunlight
I hear your song in the rain
And I hold you here inside me
Feel your love and know your pain

At this time when the earth is waking
To the dawn of another age
I tell ya now
There is no reason to be afraid

We are crying for a vision
That all living things can share
And those who care
Are with us everywhere",Brother Warrior,1989
Kate Wolf,"Just an old house with the roof fallin' in
Standin' on the edge of the field
Watching the crops grow like its always done before
Nobody lives here anymore

The sun's going down on the Carolina pines
I'm a long way from home
I miss that love of mine broken windows empty doors
Nobody lives here anymore

Old memories come whistling like the wind
Through the walls and the cracked window panes
And the grass is growing high around the kitchen door
Nobody lives here anymore

Once there were children and a few hired hands
A hard working woman and a bone tired man
Now that old sun steals across a dusty floor
Nobody lives here anymore

",Carolina Pines,1989
Kate Wolf,"Love is but a song we sing,
Hear a way we die.
You can make the mountains ring,
Hear the angels cry.
Tho' the dove is on the wing
You need not know why.

Hey, people now,
Smile on your brother.
Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

Some will come and some will go,
We shall surely pass.
When the wind that left us here,
Returns for us at last.
We are but a moment's sunlight,
Fading on the grass.

Hey, people now,
Smile on your brother.
Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

Hey, people now,
Smile on your brother.
Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

If you hear the song I'm singing,
You will understand.
You hold the key to love and fear,
All in your trembling hand.
One key unlocks them both, you know,
It's at your command.",Let's Get Together,1989
Kate Wolf,"By the banks of the river
Where the willows hang down
And the wild birds all warble
With their high, lonesome sound
Down in some hollow
Where the waters run cold
It was there I first listened
To the lies that you told.
If the young men were blackbirds
The young men were thrushes
I would lay by the hours
In the cold rainy marshes
If the young men were squirrels
With high bushy tails
I'd fill up my shotgun
With rock salt and nails.
Now I lie in my bed
And I see your sweet face
The past I remember time cannot erase
The letters you wrote me
Were written in shame
And I know that your conscience
Echoes my name.
Lord I lie here each night
All alone and I weep
Nothing ain't worse
Than a night without sleep
I walk out alone under the sky
Too empty to sing too lonesome to cry
If the ladies were blackbirds
And the young men were thrushes
I'd lie there for hours
In the cold, rainy marshes
If the ladies were squirrels
With high bushy tails
I'd fill up my shotgun
With rock salt and nails
I'd fill up my shotgun
With rock salt and nails","Rock, Salt and Nails",1994
Kate Wolf,"Kind friends all gathered 'round, there's something I would say:
That what brings us together here has blessed us all today.
Love has made a circle that holds us all inside;
Where strangers are as family, loneliness can't hide.

You must give yourself to love if love is what you're after;
Open up your hearts to the tears and laughter,
And give yourself to love, give yourself to love.

I've walked these mountains in the rain and learned to love the wind;
I've been up before the sunrise to watch the day begin.
I always knew I'd find you, though I never did know how;
Like sunshine on a cloudy day, you stand before me now.

So give yourself to love if love is what you're after;
Open up your hearts to the tears and laughter,
And give yourself to love, give yourself to love.

Love is born in fire; it's planted like a seed.
Love can't give you everything, but it gives you what you need.
And love comes when you're ready, love comes when you're afraid;
It'll be your greatest teacher, the best friend you have made.

So give yourself to if love is what you're after;
Open up your hearts to the tears and laughter,
And give yourself to love, give yourself to love.

Give yourself to love, if love is what you're after;
Open up your hearts to the tears and laughter,
And give yourself to love, give yourself to love.

Kate York,"I don't remember how I got here
When my rose coloured glasses disappeared

Sometimes my fingers, they can lose touch
Start letting go of everything I love

When I get the feeling
That my prayers have hit the ceiling
And those darker days
When my faith has lost all meaning
You keep me believing

My fears are safe here, held in your hand
When I'm broken, you put me back together again

All I could be,
When I've forgotten
Baby you remind me

When I get the feeling
That my prayers have hit the ceiling
And those darker days
When my faith has lost all meaning
You keep me believing

If every red heart, starts feeling blue

All you are for me
Baby, I'll be that for you

Were the last stab

Bright enough for me to run toward knowing
Nothing in this world will ever break my heart again
Nothing in this world will ever break my heart again
No pain this life will put me through
Will ever ever hurt like you


Don’t need a miracle
A superhero
There’s only one way up
When you’re at zero
You took my innocence
But it was knowing
No I don’t need you
And that made me a woman
I paid my dues
But that’s a debt I’m done paying
I’m standing strong
But I’m still on my knees praying

Nothing in this world will ever break my heart again
No pain this life will put me through

Katel,"J'ai bâti des endroits calmes
Des lacunes closes où crustacée
Carapatée dans mes remises
J'observe les fonds agités

Soucieuse de vivre en bonne entente
Avec mes voisins enclavés
J'ai ensablé ma carapace
Pour feindre le mollusque poulpé

Ici marinent mes idées
Contre le silence de la mer
Et si je nage en profondeur
C'est qu'en surface on les enterre

Puis j'ai vidé ma dure coquille
Des mauvaises herbes qui me squattaient
Je n'ai plus concédé de place
Qu'au strict cercle d'initiés

Dans ma lacustre cathédrale
Je crée mes religiosités
J'échappe aux cuistres et aux rustres
Aux papas encapitainés

La tempête gronde chez les vagues
C'est à la poupe qu'on s'est rué
Mais c'est le grand mât qui castagne
Les figures de proues vont brûler

Moi je retourne dans ma cocagne
Je mets mes poupées sur mes yeux
Quand je serai grande je serai sirène
Puisqu'on m'a divisée en deux

Je ferai un tour dans la caverne
Pour y danser avec les bêtes
Quand je serai grande, j'y serai reine
Et on me coupera la tête",Carapace,2008

On croisait dans les brumes
Nos bandes de gerfauts 
Qui rasaient le bitume
On claquait à grands bruits 
Le creux de vieux cylindres
Quand les dames alanguies 
Novices à la bas tringue
Paradaient aux abords 
Comme à la comédie 
Se joignaient à nos fasques
Pour faire quelques folies

On croyait pauvres fous
Humilier leurs époux
Tombés du haut des dunes
Au lit des ministères
Ces frivoles fortunes
Se juraient de nous plaire
Et là dans l'eau des lunes
Nos bouches en arrière
Noyés dans l'amertume

Où commenceraient nos guerres,

Pour que je puisse goûter à des rédemptions crades

Edentés d'un seul coup, les sourires des pleureuses

I know you had your dreams
But now it just seems
You've settled for less why should I
I know you're scared that I'll get hurt
But don't you think it's so much worse
To give it up before you even try

Something in me wants to reach with both hands
Go over the edge and see where I land
Something in me wants to know what's out there
It's something that I've gotta do
It's not you it's something in me

If I listen to my voice
It leaves me no choice
I would stay here if I could
But I know it would do no good
Maybe someday you will understand

Something in me wants to reach with both hands
Go over the edge and see where I land
Something in me wants to know what's out there
It's something that I've gotta do
It's not you it's something in me

Don't know what's on the way
But whatever it is I'll be ready
On your mark get set go
Here's the show and the road
But with you it's a load I can carry
And with each breath I would take it
Every moment gonna make it

It's a wonderful crazy
It's a beautiful out of control
Kinda scary amazing
But I don't really mind at all
It's like I'm falling, flying, laughing, crying
Hanging on and letting go
Cause my life' so wonderful crazy crazy

Some days get intense
And breakdown my defense
But I'm here and I'm not giving up
Gonna take in the sights
On the ride of my life
Living just to survive's not enough
So much love to discover
I don't need any other

I can fade back into dreaming
And I know everything's gonna be alright

Deep into your spell

I cast away my shell

The only one who could ever reach me,
Was the son of a preacher man,
The only boy who could ever teach me,
Was the son of a preacher man,
Yes he was, he was, oh yes he was.

No matter how hard I tried,
When he started sweet talking to me,
he'd come tell me everything is alright,
he'd kiss and tell me everything is alright,
Can I get away again tonight?.

Was the son of a preacher man,
The only boy who could ever teach me,
Was the son of a preacher man,

Stealing kisses from me on the sly,
Taking time to make time,
Telling me that he's all mine,
Learning from each others knowing,
Looking to see how much we'd grown.

Somewhere
There's a time for us
Someday therell time for us

Time to learn, time to care
Someday, somewhere
Well find a new way of living
Will find there's a way of forgiving

Flying over rainbows

Save you every day

Why'd I have to go and make a big thing outta nothing

'Til you were gone

Are feelin' more like faded glory

Led me down the path to this bad choice
Why don't I listen to the angels

So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.

I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night

Words are like scissors, in your hands
And there's no script to follow, so I just close my eyes
That way it won't hurt so much, when we say goodbye

I feel just like an actress, up on the stage
I can't believe, what I'm hearing myself say
And a porch light is my spotlight, so I play along with this lie
That way it won't hurt so much, when we say goodbye

Did you ever love me? Does it even matter?
Did you even notice, the whole word shatter?
I just want to hold you, and tell you that I'm sorry
But I just keep it all inside
That way it won't hurt so much, when we say goodbye

My heart feels like a circus
It's too much to take in
It's hard to lose a love
But you were my best friend

So walk this high wire, alone tonight
That way it won't hurt so much, when we say goodbye
That way it won't hurt so much, when we say goodbye",Say Goodbye,2009

With a hunger for fame
And a face and a name to remember.
The past fades away
Because as of this day
Norma Jean's gone,
She's moving on.

Her smile and your fantasies
Play a duet
That will make you forget
Where you are.
The music starts playing
It's the beat of her heart saying,
""Let me be your star.""

Flash back to a girl
With a song in her heart
As she's waiting to start the adventure.
The fire and drive
That make dreams come alive,
They fill her soul.
She's in control.

The drama, the laughter,
The tears just like pearls.
Well, they're all in this girl's repertoire.
It's all for the taking,
And it's magic we'll be making.
Let me be your star.

I'll just have to forget the hurt that came before,
Forget what used to be.
The past is on the cutting room floor,
The future is here with me.
Choose me!

Fade up on a star
With it all in her sights
All the love and the lights
That surround her.
Someday she’ll think twice
Of the dues and the price

She’ll have to pay
She’ll have to pay
But not today
But not today

Then she’ll do all she can

And for millions who look from afar.

And you can't keep a secret from the ground beneath you
Step very lightly on the earth below
Or before you know it everyone will know

Streets were paved with a thousand eyes
And try as you may you can't disguise
There's only two things that you can't hide from
That's you and the ground you're walking on

Watch where you walk, 'cause the sidewalks talk
You better watch what you do, what you do
'Cause the sidewalk talk can get carried away
You better watch what you say, what you say

They can read what you say so you gotta stay away
From words that sting, words are not true
And the things you say make a fool of you

Little white lies make the sidewalk cry
And you can betray with the things you say
Words won't last when you say 'em too fast
And you've been mislead by the things you've said

Everything you do comes back to you

When your laughter's true they'll run with you

Su una vecchia terrazza davanti al golfo di Surriento
Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce e ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assaie ma tanto bene sai
É una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare pensò alle notti lá in America
Ma erano solo le lampare e la bianca scia di un'elica
Sentì il dolore nella musica si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da un nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte
Guardò negli occhi la ragazza quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso uscì una lacrima e lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assaie, ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene, sai

Potenza della lirica, dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole confondono i pensieri
Così diventa tutto piccolo anche le nottie là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita come là scia di un'elica
Ma si è la vita che finisce ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice e ricominciò il suo canto

Still stands
For who I am
Every stone laid
Is a bridge made to my past

Towers
Over me
Shadows bring everything back in soft light
I wouldn't change yesterday not in my life
And so, I live in a house of no regrets

There are many rooms inside my head
Corridors that wind, through time, never end
They are journeys made to be

Every house is part of me

The house where I found love
Lingers
Sends me shivers
Like the first time
Stairways I climb to the heights

The house where I grew old
Will be
Free of ghosts
From what I've done I won't run come the dark night

That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.

T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear.
And Grace, my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come;
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead us home.

The Lord has promised good to me.
His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

Bright shining as the sun.
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun.

The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice.

Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know.

Her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering.
And soul by soul and silently her shining bounds increase,
And her ways are ways of gentleness and all her paths are peace.

It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree I used to play on

Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reaching smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

The old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa

Down the road I look and there comes Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all come to meet me
In the shade of the old oak tree
As they lay me ?neath the green, green grass of home
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home","Green, Green Grass of Home",2006

Mi piace, è bello, bello
Vo' andare in Porta Rossa
A comperar l'anello!
Sì, sì, ci voglio andare!
E se l'amassi indarno,
Andrei sul Ponte Vecchio,
Ma per buttarmi in Arno!
Mi struggo e mi tormento!

O my dear papa
I like him, he is handsome, handsome
I want to go to Porta Rossa
To buy the ring!

I would go to the Ponte Vecchio

Katherine Jenkins,"Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night","The Music of the Night, song (for the musical The Phantom of the Opera)",2006

A la rose s'assemble
Sur la rive en fleurs riant au matin

Suivons le courant fuyant
Dans l'onde frémissante
D'une main nonchalante
Viens, gagnons le bord,
Où la source dort et
L'oiseau, l'oiseau chante.

Ah! descendons

Under a dome of white jasmine
With the roses entwined together
On a river bank covered with flowers laughing in the morning

Gently floating on it's charming risings
On the river's current
On the shining waves
One hand reaches
Reaches for the bank
Where the spring sleeps and
The birds, the birds sing.

Under a dome of white jasmine
Ah! calling us
Together!

Under a dome of white jasmine
With the roses entwined together
On a river bank covered with flowers laughing in the morning
Let us descend together
Gently floating on it's charming risings,
On the river's current

One hand reaches,
Reaches for the bank,
Where the spring sleeps,
And the birds, the birds sing.

Under a dome of white jasmine
Ah! calling us

Katherine Jenkins,"Nella fantasia io vedo un mondo giusto
Lì tutti vivono in pace e onestà
Io sogno d'anime che sono sempre libere
Come le nuvole che volano
Pien d'umanità in fondo all'anima

Nella fantasia io vedo un mondo chiaro
Lì anche la notte è meno oscura
Io sogno d'anime che sono sempre libere
Come le nuvole che volano

Che soffia sulle città, come amico
Io sogno d'anime che sono sempre libere

You will see
What you mean to me

Search your soul

Can't tell me it's not worth dying for

Mi sopragiunse uno soave sonno
Ego dominus tuus

Io sono in pace

Katherine Jenkins,"I pray You'll be our eyes
And watch us where we go
And help us to be wise
In times when we don't know

Let this be our prayer when we lose our way
Lead us to a place
Guide us with Your grace
To a place where we'll be safe

And hold it in our hearts
When stars go out each night
You're our eternal star

Guide us with Your grace

Un mondo di giustizia e di speranza

And watch us from above

Another soul to love

Katherine Jenkins,"Bed, bed I couldn't go to bed
My head's too light to try to set it down
Sleep, sleep I couldn't sleep tonight
Not for all the jewels in the crown

I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night
And still have begged for more
I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things
I've never done before

I'll never know what made it so exciting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when he began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced all night

It's after three now
Don't you agree now?

What you gave to me
One shining dream of hope and love
Life and liberty
With a host of brave unknown soldiers
For your company you will live forever
Here in our memory

In fields of sacrifice
Heroes paid the price
Young men who died for old men's wars
Gone to paradise
We are all one great band of brothers
And one day you'll see we can live together
When all the world is free

Katherine Jenkins,"As you find your way through this life you make
I hope you live each day for all it's worth
Go where your heart leads and dream your biggest dreams
All of these things I will pray for you

I will pray for you, I will pray for you
Through every darkness, through every light
This road ahead of you, I cannot carry you
But I can promise I will pray for you

If a love so true breaks your heart in two
And it hurts so much that you can't forgive
And even the smallest step feels like miles away
But you'll get there one day, I will pray for you

I will pray for you, I will pray for you
Through every darkness, through every light
This road ahead of you, I cannot carry you
But I can promise I will pray for you

So if you ever start to wonder
If you're in this world alone
I'll be there to help you over
If you lose your way, if you lose your faith

When your time is through my final wish for you
Is to count you blessings not your regrets
With peace inside your soul and all that heaven holds
I hope you always know I will pray for you

I will pray for you, I will pray for you
Through every darkness, through every light
This road ahead of you, I cannot carry you
But I can promise I will pray for you
But I can promise I will pray for you

Katherine Jenkins,"Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you

Now I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love's no secret anymore

",Secret Love,2007
Katherine Jenkins,"My silent wish is to be back with you
The love I left I can't forget
It would kill me if you knew

My silent words are all I have to say
There was no doubt it would all work out
When I walked away

Too late to turn it all around
Too late to say I'm sorry now

Strong, sure and proud, regrets not allowed
Too scared to let it out
I hope in silence, I pray in silence
And I shout in silence

I can see right where I want to be
But it's hard to heal and it's impossible to feel
When your heart's not free

It hurts knowing I was wrong
It hurts but I will carry on

Strong, sure and proud, regrets not allowed
Too scared to let it out
I hope in silence, I shout in silence

What do I feel? Tell me what do I feel?
And what's the use of turning back the time?
The more that I say seems the more that I pay
It's best for now to keep it all inside, deep inside

So strong, sure and proud, regrets they're not allowed
It's too late to shout it out, it's too late to shout it out
I hope in silence, I pray in silence
I shout in silence

",Shout In Silence,2007
Katherine Jenkins,"So here we are
Waking from the shadows to the sun
So near so far
Feeling like our journey's just begun

All we hope and reach for
Sometimes can't be found
While we have the chance
Let's live for now

Viva tonight, I'm by your side
Viva our star our guiding light
Viva the dream we hold inside
Viva the love the love we share tonight

So hand in hand
Together we are stronger we belong
We understand
Here is where our hearts can be as one

If we lose direction
We'll get home somehow
So while we have the chance
Let's live for now

Faces faces all around us
We don't see them now we've found us
We have founds us
