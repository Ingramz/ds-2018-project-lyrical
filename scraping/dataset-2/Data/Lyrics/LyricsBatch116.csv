David Corey,"Thought I was in love before
Never knew that there was more
Saw the world in black and white
Until you came into my life
Suddenly before my eyes
There's a rainbow in the sky
Reaching out and telling me
That it's you I need

Now that I love you
I know that I never never loved anyone before you
Cause this is so real
Now that I found you
I know I could never never live my life without you
Now that I love you

I was taken by surprise
All at once I realized
How your love completed me
And how you are my destiny
You've become the air I breathe
You're nothing less than everything
You're in my heart and in my soul
You have made me whole

Now that I love you
I know that I never never loved anyone before you 
(I never loved anyone)
Cause this is so real
Now that I found you
I know I could never never live my life without you 
(Never without you)
Now that I love you

Never in my life have I been touched this way
I never been moved to say
I want forever with you
Never have I wanted someone more than you
Never been closer to my heart
Now that I love you

Oooh yeah
I love you
Now that I love you
(Now I love you)
I know that I never never loved anyone before you 
(I never loved anyone)
Cause this is so real
Now that I found you
I know I could never never live my life without you 
(Never live my life)
Now that I love you

Now that I love you
I never loved anyone
Now that I love you
Oooo ooo
Now that I love you
Baby
I never loved anyone
Now that I love you

",Now That I Love You,2003
David Corey,"It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best, when you say nothing at all

All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd
Old Mister Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best, when you say nothing at all",When You Say Nothing at All,2003
David Corey,"Winter snow is falling down
Children laughing all around
Lights are turning on like a fairy tale come true
Sittin' by the fire we made
You're the answer when I prayed 
I would find someone and baby I found you

[Chorus:]
And all I want is to hold you forever
All I need is you more everyday
You saved my heart from being broken apart
You gave your love away
And I'm thankful everyday
For the gift

Watching as you softly sleep
What I'd give if I could keep
Just this moment if all of time stood still
But the colors fade away
And the years will make us gray
But baby in my eyes you'll still be beautiful

[Chorus: x2]

Can't find the words to say 
Thank you for the gift",The Gift,2008
David Correy,"From the sky to the sea to the air that we breathe
From the depths of the earth to the stars

(Light up the world, light up the world)

Run like you're born to fly
Live like you'll never die
Dare what you dare to dream
And everything in between

I had an epiphany one night,
looking at the endless star filled sky
The world is ours!
The world is ours!
The world is ours!
(We are we are we are we are)
(We are we are we are we are)
The world is ours!

Sing out your bed and cry
Under the stage and sky
Oceans and land divide,
United we feel inside

The world is ours!
The world is ours!
The world is ours!
(We are we are we are we are)
(We are we are we are we are)

The world is ours!
(Light up the world, light up the world)

The world is ours!
The world is ours!
The world is ours!
(We are we are we are we are)
(We are we are we are we are)
The world is ours!
The world is ours! (We are we are we are we are)

David Coss,"Chillun', listen here to me
This is my philosophy
To see me through the day
To scare my cares away

All God's Chillun Got Rhythm
All God's Chillun got swing
Maybe haven't got money
Maybe haven't got shoes
All God's Chillun Got Rhythm
For to push away the blues
Yeah !

All God's Chillun got trouble
Trouble don't mean a thing
When they start to go ho ho ho de ho
Troubles bound to go 'way, say!

David Coss,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
You'd be all my heart could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

David Craig,"Oh, it really wasn't my intention
To disregard convention
It was just an impulse
That had to be obeyed.

Though it seems convention we've been scorning
I'll still not go in mourning
Though my reputation
Is blemished, I'm afraid.

With just one kiss
What heaven, what rapture, what bliss

Honestly, I thought you wouldn't.
Naturally, you thought you couldn't.
And probably we shouldn't.
But aren't you kind of glad we did?

Actually, it all was blameless.
Nevertheless, they'll call it shameless
So let's keep the lady nameless
But aren't you kind of glad we did?

Socially, I'll be an outcast
Obviously, we dined alone
On my good name there will be doubt cast
With never a sign of any chaperon.

No matter how they may construe it
Whether or not, we have to rue it
Whatever made us do it
Say, aren't you kind of glad we did?

Whatever made us do it
Say, aren't you kind of glad we did",Aren't You Kind of Glad We Did?,1998
David Cromwell,"The Creation of Man
Peacocks!
Sink me!
Think ye, Sir, how those feathered boys love to flaunt their tails
Stallions
Zounds Sir!
Hounds, Sir! Stags! 
Of the goosie and the gander
Sir, who's gender is the grander 
Sir to render total candor
Sir, the splendor is the male's!

What Mans duty is to wield the sword, defend the cave!
What! Oh no, highness, a male's duty is to uphold the banner of beauty 
And you, as prince of our land, must lead the way
Be an example to your sex, give your boot a dapper strap

And it's smarter if your garter has some snap
Cravats should be flounced about our necks! 
Let the royal coattails flap! 
Be bewitching with some stitching on your cap
Now drape your cape and puff your cuff, embroider those lapels!
Be the king of the beasts in pastels
La but someone has to strike a pose
And bear the weight of well-tailored clothes
And that is why the Lord created men!

You're a nincompoop, Blakeney
Why thank you, Sir
Always said you were, always said leave the fancy dress to the women!
Let me be a Roman, put on a tunic
Bare the legs, a-what
Sink me! The man's lost his senses! Bare legs!

Strut Sir!
What Sir
Roosters do give a cock his comb and the hens will pale 
Bucks! Bulls!
More Sir!
Boars, Sir! Rams!
Of the nanny-goat and billy, Sir, whose beard is fully wooly 
Sir It's bully for the billy for he's willy-nilly male!

Well the male animal is dashing of course, robins redbreast
Moose with antlers!

Sir, Be a lion-hearted prig! Fill those pantaloons with light!
I could dangle down a spangle out of sight
Oh yes, be bold Sir! When it's cold slap on that wig
Draw your breeches in quite tight
Even more so and your torso will ignite!
Now smock your frock
Perfume your plume!
I'll let my waistcoat swing
And the jungle will bow to its king! 
La but someone has to strike a pose 
And bear the weight of well-tailored clothes
And that is why the Lord created men!
Now, strange, there's nothing about it in the book of Genisus
Genisus! Ah, but think Sir 
Adam was a gentleman in Eden 
Though his body was admired, 
You would grant the adding of a fig leaf was inspired
Oh, a fig leaf did just the job

If you're out to make a splash, Cheri, do know your haberdashery!
Buttons, buckles, ruffles, and lace!
Represent the human race!

And bear the weight of well-tailored clothes!

David Crosby,"It's hard enough, I know
To find the strength to go
Back to where it all began
It's hard to enough to gain
Any traction in the rain
You know it's hard for me to understand 

Hard to find a way
To get through another city day
Without thinking about
Gettin' out 

Now the strangest thing I've seen
Was a t-shirt turning green
In envy of turtle dove
The dove's lady was the cause
Or maybe it was the olive branch she held in her claws
Or maybe he could see they were in love 

You know it's hard for me to find a way
To get through another city day
Without thinking about
Gettin' out",Traction in the Rain,1971
David Crosby,"[Instrumental (Electric Guitars)]
I wonder who they are
The men who really run this land
And I wonder why they run it
With such a thoughtless hand
What are their names
And on what streets do they live
I'd like to ride right over
This afternoon and give
Them a piece of my mind
About peace for mankind
Peace is not an awful lot to ask
[Instrumental Ending (Electric Guitars)]",What Are Their Names,1971
David Crosby,"Sit yourself down at the piano
Put all your fingers on the blacknotes
Anywhere you want to
Sing along-write a song
And understand that you can play",Blacknotes,1972
David Crosby,"I tried to reach beyond the walls you're living in
As a friend I flew a long way for a friend
But the way you treated me
Made me feel like giving in
I don't know if I'll break or only bend
You're supposed to be my friend

And if you carry on the way you did today
All the music in my veins will turn to stone
All the faking of your friendship
Doesn't make it anyway
Does it get you off to act so all alone
It'll chill you to the bone

So my advice to you is not to take advice
From the dealers who are handing out the cards
Take your life into your own hand
Just have faith in who you are
And all your goodness that I'm forced to disregard
Because you make it much to hard.",Frozen Smiles,1972
David Crosby,"Born in the sunshine
Dyin' in the rain
Raised on laughter
Lost in a game
Love you
Love you

The game was bein' better
Wiser than you
Half and inch taller
A deeper shade of blue
Or thinkin' that I loved you
More than you loved me
Failing to lay it on the line
All the time

The game of gettin' money
The game of gettin' more
The ego game of power
The ugly game of war
Kills love
Don't you know that?

Born in the sunshine
Dyin' in bad air
Started out honest
Wound up down there
Love you
Love you.",Games,1972
David Crosby,"Come another year-and I am sitting here
Looking over all the Haight
As far as my eyes can see
What's happening to me? Trying to find
A girl to be on my mind.

Come another year-will she be here?
I wonder what I'm looking for
But I'm looking everyday
Searching every face-trying to find
A girl to be on my mind.

On my mind there is a question
Time-time
Only time will tell when time is right
I await my resurrection
Feeling fine

Come another year-will I be sitting here
Looking after someone else
Who's looking after me
That's happiness to me-so I am trying to find
A girl to be on my mind.",Girl to Be on My Mind,1972
David Crosby,"There I was at the immigration scene
Shining and feeling clean
Could it be a sin?
I got stopped by the immigration man
He says he doesn't know if he can
Let me in-let me in-immigration man
Can I cross the line and pray
I can stay another day
Let me in immigration man
I won't toe your line today
I can't see it anyway

There he was with his immigration face
Giving me a paper chase
But the sun was coming
Cos all at once he looked into my space
And stamped a number over my face
And he sent me running
Let me in-let me in-immigration man
Can I cross the line and pray
I can stay another day
Let me in immigration man
I won't toe your line today
I can't see it anyway

Here I am with my immigration form
It's big enough to keep me warm
When a cold wind's coming
So go where you will
So long as you think you can
You'd better watch out-watch out-for the man
Anywhere you're going.

Won't you let me in immigration man
Can I cross your line and pray
Take your fingers from the tray
Let me in-irritation man
I won't toe your line today
I can't see it anyway.",Immigration Man,1972
David Crosby,"Look around again
It's the same old story
You see, it's got to be
It says right here on page 43
That you should grab a hold of it
Else you'll find
It's passed you by

Rainbows all a round
Can you find the silver and gold?
It'll make you old
The river can be hot or cold
And you should dive right into it
Else you'll find
It's passed you by

Pass it round one more time

Even with the ups and downs
And you should have a sip of it
Else you'll find
It's passed you by.",Page 43,1972
David Crosby,"Liberty, laughing and shaking your head
Can you carry the torch that'll bring home the dead?
To the land of their fathers whose lives you have led
To the station at the end of the town
On the southbound train going down..

Equality, quietly facing the fist
Are you angry and tired that your point has been missed?
Will you go in the back-room
And study the list
Of the gamblers using the phone
On the southbound train going down

Fraternity, failing to fight back the tears
Will it take an eternity breaking all the fears?
And what will the passenger do when he hears-
That he's already paid for the crown
On the southbound train going down.",Southbound Train,1972
David Crosby,"My eyes were full of morning
And my mouth was full of night
I was in a strangers room
And I couldn't find the light
I rose to use a different bathroom
Than the one before
And what it is I'm running from Is what it is I'm running for.

Where do I go from here? Help me.
I wish I could disappear and go away
From the knowing
That you've known me far too long.
When I find a different tune
I guess I'll sing a different song

Wish I could disappear and go away from the morning

And I still can't find the light.",Strangers Room,1972
David Crosby,"You are walking
You've always been walking
Stumbling half-blinded
And dry as the wind
That strafes you and leaves you
To lie in the sand
And the wall stretches endless beside you to nowhere
This wall that you've been trying to cross for years
This fence made of tears
No one hears

You see a door
Ah, such a great open door
You know that your eyes tellin' lies
Still you chance
A shambling run, a ridiculous dance
Like a scarecrow that's hung up to dry on a fencepole
And there's a place like vacuum waiting inside you
For you to get through
To the blue

You scent the water
Fresh green grass, food and water
Your breath is scraping your brain into dust
Your rusty old engine is ready to bust
You cannot believe it that they would not trust you
The door is wavering
Is that your eyes?
Are they still telling lies?
What are lies?",The Wall Song,1972
David Crosby,"Where will I be when I go back home?
Who will I see when I'm all alone?

What am I going to do?",Where Will I Be?,1972
David Crosby,"On what do you base your life, my friend?
Can you see around the bend?
Can you see?

On what star do you take your sight
On a cold and blowy night
Alone, alone?

Old man can you make a mirror for me?
It's got to be clearer than air for me
Cause you see I can't see me, no

And I always thought that I meant what I said
But you know that lately I've read
We were lying

All of us lying
Just making it up, yeah
Cutting it out of whole cloth, yeah.",Whole Cloth,1972
David Crosby,"On the one side, truth towers like a cliff
On the other side, love dangles by a thread
And here is a climber who cannot find his eyes
And a falling woman wishing she was dead
Both sides, why is it always bittersweet?
and the broken cloudy days
when I need the sun's heat
I need the heat, oh both way

Why is it always bittersweet
And the broken cloudy days
When I need the sun's heat
Oh, I need the heat
Why, why is it bittersweet?

Is when I need the sun's heat
I need the heat",Bittersweet,1975
David Crosby,"When I was a young man I found an old dream
Was as battered and worn a one as you have ever seen
But I made it some new wings and I painted a nose
And I wished so hard up in the air I rose, singing

Carry me, carry me, carry me above the world
Carry me, carry me, carry me

And I once loved a girl
She was younger than me
Her parents kept her locked up in their life
And she was crying at night
She was wishing she could be free

Course mostly I remember her laughing
Standing there watching us play
For a while there, the music would take her away
And she'd be singing

Carry me, carry me, carry me above the world
Carry me, carry me, carry me above the world

And then there was my mother
She was lying in white sheets there and she was waiting to die
She said if you'd just reach underneath this bed
And untie these weights
I could surely fly

She's still smiling but she's tired
She'd like to hear that last bell ring
You know if she still could she would
Stand up, and she could sing, singing

Carry me, carry me, carry me above the world
Carry me, carry me, carry me",Carry Me,1975
David Crosby,"Saw a sing on the highway
I was driving along, way home
On a hilltop is where I belong
I took a look at the hole
Where my head used to be
And I'll sing you a song
That descended on me

[Chorus]
The way I live
Determines the way
My people survive
Yes the way I live
Determines the way
My people survive
So I went to the country
To look up a friend
Cause I heard that the house
And the barn had a blend
I took a look at the hole
Where the bird used to be
And I'll sing him a song
Because he sang one for me

[Chorus]

And the names of the cowboys
Will all blow away
Like the dust off the desert
On a hot windy day
I've tried so hard to tell you
In so many ways
That I'm scared of the heartache and scenes
With the cowboy of dreams",Cowboy of Dreams,1975
David Crosby,"Digging in your fields
Pulling up your food
No matter how I feel, don't do me no good
""Treat me like a human,"" is all I got to say
The man that I am working for won't let me get away
I came across your border just to work for you
I give you all I've got to give
What more can I do?

Don't give me law and order
Tell me to stick around
While standing in the picket line
you try and shoot me down down
I came to your country to work on the land
Watching the seeds as they die in the sand
Fighting for your freedom with a hoe in your hand

Fieldworker, fieldworker
Digging in your fields
Pulling up your food
No matter how I feel, don't do me no good.

She moves with a whispering
She waits for my mind to slow
And then I'm hers to know

Have you seen her love eyes?

The water will make us one
The sleep of peace will come
The end of trouble has begun

Have you seen her love eyes?
Watching me, her love eyes ooh",Gentle Thing,1975
David Crosby,"First rain of winter
First fall from grace
It's my first hallow echo
In the halls of praise

How could Samson
I thought he was blind as a bat
How could he have torn down
The temples like that

And how could little Caesar
How could he know whereof he spoke
When all of his wheels are turning him into a joke

[Chorus]
'Cause the blind are leading the blind
And am I amazed at how they stumble
Homeward through the haze
Got the soul of a rag picker
Got the mind of a slug

My fine fair weather friends, yeah

Will have no more time
To make their amends

Then there's nothing standing in my way.
I'm telling you all I've got to be on my way.

I used to keep on trying from day to day
To keep from dying and fading away.
It seems like a strange thing for me to say
I'm so tired of looking the other way
Love work out

You gotta make a love work out
There's no use hiding behind the clouds
You gotta make a love work out
I dare to scream it right out loud.

David Crosby,"There's one more thing I would like to say
About what you do
There's one more thing
There might be one more way to do what you do.
You don't have anything

Can there be anything
Left for you to prove?
You have already made your move
Don't you even know who you are
Star?

And I woke up this morning
To the sound of a woman-a woman crying
Crying for a roomful, a roomful of dreams,
Dreams dying.

You don't have to tell the truth
Just as long as you can stand there and ignore the pain
You've got a ticket to ride on this train
By the way, you're gonna ride it alone
Alone.

It's a low down payment on this pillar
Pillar of salt
It's only had one owner, and he up and died
He died of guilt.

And you can drive it out of here
All you do is find a gear
That will blow it apart,
That's if you can even get it to start.
If the damn thing just had a heart
If it had a heart-some kinda heart.",Low Down Payment,1975
David Crosby,"The horns in the fog could be heard if not seen,
Helping to guide the blind in a dream.
And down by the seashore, a banquet she gave
She was feeding and needing a soul she could save.

[Chorus]
Mama lion, mama lion, I'm starting to sink
Beneath the sunshine and the icicles
In the things that you think.

There's a hole in my destiny
And I'm out on the brink
Mama lion, mama lion
She bounces off the boulders, she runs on the rocks
She's taking her time from her grandfather clocks.
And over the border, and down on the land
She's living in the future
And it lies in her hand

[Chorus]",Mama Lion,1975
David Crosby,"The clown sat speechless, looking in his mirror
Unable to remember how to paint his face
Staring at the image, slowly getting clearer
Wondering if his fear or his heart would win the race

When it dawns on you
What it takes from you
Living under clouds of pain
There's a storm in you

You don't know what to do
Just when you think you're going insane
You lie naked in the rain again
Fluttering pages of faces

No two alike
Choice is your soul's moment
For its light to strike",Naked in the Rain,1975
David Crosby,"Take the money and run
Like a thief across a neighbor's yard
Take the money and run
Like a ghost out in the night.
Take the money and run
Cause you found out that it wasn't hard
To take the money and run
Because you were out of sight.
You cannot tell me any more lies
You cannot pull the wool over my eyes
Take the money and run

Take the money and run
'cause the summer sun is sinking down
Take the money and run
Cause the four winds may not blow
Take the money and run
Cause the verdict has been handed down
Take the money and run
Because there's no place left to go.
You cannot give me any more time.
You've already taken too much of mine
Take the money and run

Take the money and run
Like a thief across a neighbor's yard
Take the money and run
Like a dog out in the night
Take the money and run
Because you found out that it wasn't hard
To take the money and run
Because you were out of sight.
You cannot give me any more time.
You've already taken too much of mine
Take the money and run",Take the Money and Run,1975
David Crosby,"There's a story I'd like you to listen to.
About a lady and a Broken Bird
Broken by the hammer
You took it so hard
You hardly said a word
Sending them back over the lines
Whistling down the wire
From pole to pole
Bending them over the times
Trying to burn the diamonds from the holy coal
Telling this story slowly together
Reading in the dark
The bird that you saw dying
We saw flying.",Broken Bird,1976
David Crosby,"I feel like a child
Feel as if I might have grown up wild
And I feel like a fool
Feel as if I didn't do well at school
And I keep expecting things that don't happen
Should but they don't
Could but they won't
And I don't see
No I don't see
Just don't understand
I must be such a foolish man
And I would laugh. If I could laugh
But it's so damn close to the bone
Would make you feel alone
And time just flies
Yes it does
Seems like fortunes moment
Passes
Blind to delight
And free from the weight of masses
But I keep expecting, things that don't happen
Should but they don't
Could but they won't
And I don't see
No I don't see
I just don't understand
I must be such a Foolish Man",Foolish Man,1976
David Crosby,"You finally found someone to watch the sunset with
You finally found a girl that makes you shine
And all you ever wanted was for her to be
By your side

I hope you take the time to understand me now
If I said some things you might not like to hear
But it's only me and how I feel about you
You are my friend

Watching over all the years I've known you now
You've been looking through the glass at shooting stars
And all you ever wanted was for them to see
Who they are, it's not far

So forgive me if I ever disappointed you
And said some things you might not like to hear
But it's only me and how I feel about you
You are my friend",J.B.'s Blues,1976
David Crosby,"Order me a drink
I'll have a glass of red wine
If you don't know what you want

With no salt
In her eyes

She held me and never asked me why
I loved her all of goodbye
I'll be by
Sitting on the edge
With my face in your pool
Trying my best to keep it cool
She dried herself

She held me and never asked me why
I loved her all of goodbye
I'll be by",Marguerita,1976

Is hoping that the fish will fly
And the boat on the bay
Is waiting for the cloud to cry

Mutiny
On Sailboat Bay
Mutiny
So far away

And the cannibals are waiting on the edge
To eat the meat that they can smell
And the monkeys standing in line
Can do the two step very well
On the gang plank one at a time
A story for the waves to tell-about

[Chorus]

With the ice man cooling the wind
The coastline can't be very far
With the shore man rowing behind
We'll find our way beneath the stars
But the captain sat there and grinned
And he set the sail for Shangrila

[Chorus]",Mutiny,1976
David Crosby,"How come you ask me what I'm doing here
With my guitar in hand
I'm at the microphone stand
I think the reason should be very clear
You see the spotlight it's for a good night
Something happens to you
And the same thing happens to me
So if I sing about the places you've been to
You can see them once again through me
But it's only me

So if you catch me handing you a line
Please forgive me ah but let me be
I've got to do it almost all the time
It fills a big hole in my young soul
Something happens to you
And the same thing happens to me
You can see them once again through me
But it's only me",Spotlight,1976
David Crosby,"This is me
Can you take another look
Did I see you looking blindly at your book
Is it all that you thought, that you thought it took
Can it be taken, taken at all

Were you looking for signs along the way
Can you see by your lonely light of day
Is this road really the only way
Can this road be taken, taken at all

We lost it on the highway
Down the dotted line
You were going your way
I was going mine
We lost it on the highway
Things are out of sight
You were going your way

I look in your eyes
At the smile in your eyes
And time after time

In a slow easy climb
Up the road that we'll run together
And the love that is growing in my heart
We should not be apart

Falls into place
When I look at your face
I see a smile on your face.",Time After Time,1976

Tonight I'm wondering why.
You try to understand the things that I feel

To where only the strong get through

It slips right out on you
Though there are days the light can flicker or fade
Here in this place tonight a fire is burning

So we sort through the pieces

Searching through the darkness to find
The breaks in the sky

When the hero
Kills the maiden

Gettin' in trouble drivin' our folks up the wall
Wastin' time
Yeah, but we had fun
She was gonna ride her bike to China
Sail away on a bottle top
And as the years passed by
One night I held her close to me
That was the first time I
Said I love you to Natalie
Carousel was crowded so we talked for a while
Natalie said ""Baby, you know I miss your smile
Whenever you go away from me""
You know that time starts tickin' when a love starts to fade
I knew something was wrong but still I thought we had it made
The first time I said I love you to Natalie
That was the first time I said I love you to Natalie

Now I look at her pictures and I talk to these walls
Call out her name but she don't hear me at all

And she got wild and restless
Tried everything she could take
One night I tried to stop her
But I was too late
That was the last time I said I love you to Natalie
And that was the last time I said I love you to Natalie

The hills or the valleys come near or come far
They say youth's a treasure we waste when we're young
So come down from the place where your medals are hung
You're forever returning and learning to fight
And you feel just like an old soldier tonight

Listen old soldier cause time doesn't wait
The moon's on your shoulder the hour is late
There's something there inside you still calls out to you
And you won't fade away whatever you do
You're forever beginning barely winning the fight
And you feel just like an old soldier tonight
You're not getting any younger that much is true now
But you've still got that hunger burning in you now
So what do you do now

What do you do now?
Listen old soldier to the sound in your ears
Of too many battles for too many years
There's only one thing you've learned in defeat
Losing is bitter and victory is sweet
You're always unraveling traveling light
And you feel just like an old soldier tonight
Feel just like an old soldier tonight, mmm",Old Soldier,1993
David Crosby,"I used to walk around with my eyes on fire
My nerves real close to my skin
Had a fist full of questions and a brand on my cheek
And we would skate where the ice got thin

And the smoke blowing down from a cabin on a hilltop
Smoke blowing down in the street
Some kind of sweet smelling mystical backdrop
To the story unfolding at my feet

There's an edge to the twist of an acrobat in the air
There's an edge to the twist of a knife
There's a hard heart of darkness hovering there
Just around the corner from life

And I, I have no answers
I got no patented path to set you free
Besides I wouldn't know where you wanted to go
And it's probably not the same place as me

There's a thousand roads up this mountain
You can get lost in a minute if you try
And it's probably enough that I was just laughing today, yeah
Looking this close in your eye

David Crosby,"You were dreaming on a park bench
About a broad highway somewhere
When the music from the carillon
Seemed to hurl your heart out there
Past the scientific darkness
Past the fireflies that float
To an angel bending down
To wrap you in her warmest cloak
And you ask ""What am I not doing?""
She says ""Your voice cannot command""
She says, ""In time you will move mountains
And it will come through your hands""

Still you angle for an option
Still you argue for your case
Like you wouldn't know a burning bush
Till it blew up in your face
We dream about the future
We memorize the past
When just a simple reaching out
Could build a bridge that lasts
And you ask ""What am I not doing?""
She says ""Your voice cannot command""
""In time you will move mountains
And it will come through your hands""

So whatever your hands find to do
You must do with all your heart
There are thoughts enough to blow men's minds
And tear great worlds apart
There's a healing touch to find you
Out on that broad highway somewhere
Gonna lift you as high as music
Running through an angel's hair
And don't worry what you are not doing
Cause your voice cannot command
And in time you will move mountains
And it will come through your hands
Through your hands
Through your hands
Mmm",Through Your Hands,1993
David Crosby,"I recall my so called misspent youth
It seems more worthwhile every single day
Cruisin' Van Nuys and acting so uncouth
All the joys of runnin' away
There was no speed limit on the Nevada state line
The air was red wine on those top down nights
Just you and me my old roller-skate
And the common sense to know our rights
Sweet old racin' car of mine
Roarin' down that broken line
I never been so much alive
Too fast for comfort
Too low to fly
Too young to die

You say a man can't love a material thing
With aluminum skin and a cast iron soul
But they never heard your engine sing
Ah, there's peace in losing control
""Sticky fingers"" turned up real loud
Ah, we were flirtin' with catastrophe
We were doing everything that's not allowed
Life didn't come with a warranty for you and me

Too fast for comfort
Too low to fly
Too young to die

There is peace in losing control
When I die I don't want to go to Heaven
I just want to drive my beautiful machine
Up north on some Sonoma County road
With Jimmy Dean and Steve McQueen all the boys be singin', singin'
Sweet old racin' car of mine
Roarin' down that broken line

He met her in a French cafe
She slipped in sideways like a cat
Sidelong glances what a wary little stray
She sticks in his mind like that
Saying ""Avez-vous une allumette?""
With her lips wrapped around a cigarette
Yvette in English saying ""Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss""
He's struggling with a foreign tongue
Reaching for words and drawing blanks
A loud mouth is stricken deaf and dumb
In a bistro on the left bank
""If I were a painter"" Picasso said
""I'd paint this girl from toe to head""
Yvette in English saying ""Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss""
Burgundy nocturne tips and spills
They move along nicely in the spreading stain
New chills new thrills for the old uphill battle
How did he wind up here again
Walking, talking, touched and scared
Uninsulated wires bared
Yvette in English going ""Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss"", mmm

[Instrumental (Acoustic Guitar)]

What blew her like a leaf this way
Up in the air and down to earth
First she flusters then she frays
So quick to question her own worth
Her cigarette burns her fingertips
It falls like fireworks she curses it
Sweetly in English she says ""Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss"", mmm ...
He sees her turn and walk away
Skittering like a cat on a stone
High heels clicking what a wary little stray
She leaves him by the seine alone
With black water and amber lights
A boney bridge between left and right

Little bit of instant bliss""

David Crosby,"Me and my good partners we were riding back to our camp
We were feeling very fine air was clear and slightly damp
We were riding back to have ourselves a party
To celebrate the robbing of the train

We were talking kind of low and lazy
About not having to go out soon again, oh yeah
You know we hadn't been back home two hours
We heard a hawk cry out in the night
And you know that's a signal from young Billy, who's our sentry

He's saying something here ain't exactly right, oh
So we quick grabbed some of our hardware
Stumbled out of our home
Two minutes flat we had found her an Indian girl all alone

And Eli said, ""Let's take her back to the cabin""
I said, ""You don't know she might be the law, yeah""
He said, smiling kind of nasty
""It ain't too damn likely she'll beat me to the draw"", Oh yeah

We were walking back through the darkness
I heard the Duke, he's our dynamiter, say
He said, ""What's your name, sweet little Indian girl?""
She said, ""Raven"" and she looked away
Right then I didn't trust her, no and I said so, oh no

Now, Eli, he's our fastest gunner
He's kind of mean and young from the South
He said, ""Fat Albert, you're getting kind of old and weird now""
You'd better get your twelve gauge or shut your mouth and ass now?
And I [Incomprehensible]

Now Eli and the Duke they got down to it
They each wanted the Indian girl for their own
But when they finally got around to asking her
You know she said, ?She'd come to take young Billy home?
Eli said, ?He'd kill young Billy he'd kill the Duke
And probably me too, yeah?, the Indian girl said, ""Go ahead now do it""
I said, ""Stop it"", and she bit my thumb nearly clean through

And when they finally started to break down the door
I smeared my face up with blood from my thumb, yeah
I laid down on the floor and played real good possum
You know I'm crazy but I ain't real dumb, oh no

Now I'm dying here in Albuquerque
I must be the sorriest sight you ever saw
You know the reason I'm the only man here to tell it
You know that Indian girl, she wasn't an Indian she was the law, oh

Intro. (Acoustic Guitar and Electric Guitar)]
How can I sweep these words into a cluster
Put 'em in a pile like feathers on your floor?
Voyages and sea forests deep blue and rusty
Sew 'em in a satchel 'n leave 'em at your door
People's lives, people's whose lives
They fascinate me
All my life, all my life
I've wanted to understand
There's a man on the corner he's got the moon in his eyes
He just comes here to visit and he wears a disguise
And I wonder if he's looking for friends or for truth
I think he's calling for some in that telephone booth
And the smiling woman answers
She defeats fear with her eyes
She thinks life's fine so I think she's wise
And my heart wants to give her a gift so grand
That it will speak for me and tell her just where I stand
And I stand on a pillar and it's melting like ice
Of years that I've lived and some I've lived twice
And I have all these feathers and leaves on my floor
That I don't want just blowing around loose anymore
And I feel a need to gather to rummage and fetch
To shake out my life and give it a stretch
To bring shells to the surface, give 'em to you
Gifts from the sea floor rusty and blue
[Instrumental (Electric Guitar)]
Now these two lives hold my attention quite well
You see lives almost never run parallel
Like the boards in the flooring all deep grained and worn
Fated and fitted long before we were born
People's lives, people's whose lives
They fascinate me
All my life, all my life
I've wanted to understand
Understand

And welcome me back to town
Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlour
And I'll tell you how it all went down

Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
And I remember something that you once told me

And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
'Cause I headed West to grow up with the country

Across those prairies with those waves of grain
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennesee
We flew straight across that river bridge

Last night half past two
The switchman waved his lantern goodbye and good day as we
Went rolling through
Billboards and truckstops pass by the grievous angel

And now I know just what I have to do
And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something I've never been shown
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea

And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennesee
The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt

And headed out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
And I remember something that you once told me

And I'll be damned if it did not come true

Well, must be because I had the flu this Christmas
Oh, yeah and I'm not feeling up to par

There lives in me a still, sure, spirit part.
Clouds of doubt are cut asunder (clouds of doubt).
By the lightning and the thunder
Shining from the compass of my heart (shining from my heart).

And the monkey gonna finally fight""

David Crosby,"I come through here quite often
And I think about you
I come through here quite often
And I wonder what you do

A wrong turn at the corner
I could say I got lost
A confusion of memories
Where two streets crossed

The vision I remember
Is eyes through the steam
Coming off the coffee
And rising off the cream

And I don't even know you
And I don't mean to stare
But I know what you're thinking
I can see that you dare to

Care about people
And look into their lives
As you hand them a spoon
As you polish the knives

You reach out and touch one
Every once in a while
With off handed wisdom
Or a lop-sided smile

Now they say don't talk to strangers
I say ""why the hell not""
If you don't talk to strangers
Tell me what have you got?

A world without wisdom
A life without laughs
A season of loneliness
And friendships in half's

Do you care about strangers
And look into their lives
Their sons and their daughters
Their husbands and wives

So I come here for coffee
And I watch your face
To see secret kindness
And watch quiet grace",Through Here Quite Often,2004

",I'd Swear There Was Somebody Here,2006
David Crosby,"I thought I met a man
Who said he knew a man
Who knew what was going on
I was mistaken
Only another stranger
That I knew
And I thought I had found a light
To guide me through
My night and all this darkness
I was mistaken
Only reflections of a shadow
That I saw
And I thought I'd seen someone
Who seemed at last
To know the truth
I was mistaken
Only a child laughing

I wonder who they are
The men who really run this land
And I wonder why they run it
With such a thoughtless hand
What are their names
And on what streets do they live

This afternoon and give
Them a piece of my mind
About peace for mankind
Peace is not an awful lot to ask

David Crosby,"Almost cut my hair.
It happened just the other day.
Its getting kinda long.
Could have said it was in my way,
But I didn't and I wonder why.
Feel like letting my freak flag fly.
Yes, I feel like I owe it to someone.

Must be because I had the flu for Christmas.
And I'm not feeling up to par.
It increases my paranoia.
Like looking in a mirror and seeing a police car.
But I'm not giving in an inch to fear.
Cause I promised myself this year
I feel like I owe it to someone.

But when I get myself together.
I'm gonna get back in that sunny southern weather.
And I'll find a place inside to laugh.

Of things that they remember well
Stories and faces dearly held

A couple in love livin' week to week
Rooms full of laughter
If these walls could speak

If these old halls, hallowed halls could talk
These would have a tale to tell
Of sun goin' down and dinner bell
And children playing at hide and seek from floor to rafter

If these halls could speak
They would tell you that I'm sorry
For bein' cold and blind and weak
They would tell you that it's only
That I have a stubborn streak
If these walls could speak

If these old fashioned window panes were eyes
I guess they would have seen it all
Each little tear and sigh and footfall
And every dream that we came to seek or followed after

If these walls could speak
They would tell you that I owe you
More than I could ever pay

David Crosby,"After holding on to nothing for awhile
I glanced to see what waited there
A shadow leaning easy by a window
A scent of something recent in the air

Nothing runs faster than time at night
But time slows down every day
All those hours with nothing to do
Holding nothing again today

Sunny days can fool you
They can look wet with rain
And even words from a friend can bring back
The pain

Memories come back on their own
Birds fly south in the sky
Pictures are drawn pencil sketches at dawn
Wishes that I too could fly

Sunny days can fool you
They can look wet with rain
And even words from a friend can bring back
The pain

All the pictures I see are smiling at me
But today I’m somebody new
Not really knowing just coming and going
A stranger just passing through",Holding on to Nothing,2014
David Crosby,"She grinds her hips
Maybe arches her back
There’s nobody there to see when she is doing that
The guy’s not there
He just doesn’t exist
She’s looking at empty space when she is doing this
She might walk home
She’s kind of tired
Or spend some of the money on a cab she’s hired

Below a bus groans by
And splashes a man
Who swears out a drunkard’s curse on the whole damned world
She smiles at that
And then starts to cry
She scrubs at a spot on her leg and then lets it dry

Then she’s sitting on the floor
With her head hung down
Listening to another language on TV
Unaware, hair unbound
Wondering where her mother and father might be
If she called, if she called

She dreams, she dreams
Don’t we all dream
A place, a way
A recurring theme

She remembers a time
When love was alive
Somehow it get’s lost in the sound of the city’s morning drive
Lost in the sound of the city’s roaring, morning drive",If She Called,2014
David Crosby,"People do so many things that make me mad but
Angry isn’t how I want to spend what time I have
Cognitive dissonance they call it
I wonder just how small it
Could be made to be in me

There so much disturbing short sighted shit
We must be able to do better than just live with it
I’m looking to find some peace within me to embrace
To encourage that smile to find my face
Sometimes I’m winning

Life in the city is so densely packed
Fear of each other is an accepted fact
Fear soaks into concrete just like grease
Fear is the antithesis of peace

“I have a dream,” a great man said
Another man came and shot him in the head
Yet the dream floats out there visible
Still alive, still alive

Those who rule the middle kingdom hate
The old man in the robes
They put up road blocks everywhere he goes
He says, “have no anger in your heart for them
They know not what they do”
Does that sound familiar
To you, to you

Life in the city is so densely packed
Fear of each other is an accepted fact
Fear soaks into concrete just like grease
Fear is the antithesis of peace

David Crosby,"Eight miles high and when you touch down
You'll find that it's stranger than known
Signs in the street that say where you're going
Are somewhere just being their own

Nowhere is there warmth to be found
Among those afraid of losing their ground
Rain gray town known for it's sound
In places small faces unbound

Round the squares huddled in storms
Some laughing some just shapeless forms
Sidewalk scenes and black limousines
Some living some standing alone",Eight Miles High,2014

May hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering

Into my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it

Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone
It's just escaping on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time
It's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing

Take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time
Far past the frozen leaves
The haunted frightened trees
Out to the windy bench
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky
With one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea
Circled by the circus sands
With all memory of fate
Driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

It's still lying there where some careless wave
Forgot it long ago
When I awoke this morning
Dove beneath my floating home
Down below her graceful side
In the turning tide
To watch the sea fish roam
And there I heard a story
From the sailors of the Sandra Marie
There's another isle a days' run away from here
It's empty and free
From here to Venezuela nothing more to see
Than a hundred thousand islands
Flung like jewels upon the sea

David Crosby,"Jamaica was the lovely one, I played her well
As we lay in the tall grass where the shadows fell
Hiding from the children so they would not tell
We would stay there 'til her sister rang the evening bell

Jamaica, say you will
Help me find a way to fill these empty hours
Say you will come again tomorrow

The daughter of a captain on the rolling seas
She would stare across the water from the trees
Last time he was home he held her on his knees
And said, ""The next time they would sail away just where they pleased""

Jamaica, say you will
Help me find a way to fill these lifeless sails
And stay until' my ships can find the sea

Jamaica was a sweet young one, I loved her true
She was a comfort and a mercy through and through
Hiding from this world together, next thing I knew
We had brought her things down to the bay, what could I do

Jamaica, say you will
Help me find a way to fill these sails
And we will sail until' our waters have run dry",Jamaica Say You Will,2015
David Crosby,"Oh people, look around you 
The signs are everywhere 
You've left it for somebody other than you 
To be the one to care 
You're lost inside your houses 
There's no time to find you now 
Your walls are burning 
And your towers are turning 
I'm going to leave you here 
And try to get down to the sea somehow 

The road is filled with homeless souls 
Every woman, child and man 
Who have no idea where they will go 
But they'll help you if they can 
Now everyone must have some thought 
That's going to pull them through somehow 
Well the fires are raging hotter and hotter 
But the sisters of the sun are going 
To rock me on the water now 

Rock me on the water 
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow 
Rock me on the water 
I'll get down to the sea somehow 

Oh people, look among you 
It's there your hope must lie 
There's a sea bird above you 
Gliding in one place like Jesus in the sky 
We all must do the best we can 
And then hang on to that Gospel plow 
When my life is over, I'm going 
To stand before the Father 
But the sisters of the sun are going 
To rock me on the water now 

Rock me on the water 
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow 
Rock me on the water, maybe I'll remember 
Maybe I'll remember how 
Rock me on the water

So rock me on the water 
I'll get down to the sea somehow",Rock Me on the Water,2015
David Crosby,"Got out of town on a boat goin' to Southern Islands
Sailing a reach before a followin' sea
She was makin' for the trades on the outside
And the downhill run to Papeete

Off the wind on this heading lie the Marquesas
We got eighty feet of the waterline nicely making way
In a noisy bar in Avalon I tried to call you
But on a midnight watch I realized why twice you ran away

Think about
Think about how many times I have fallen
Spirits are using me, larger voices callin'
What Heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten

Around the world (I have been around the world)
Lookin' (lookin' for that woman girl)
Who knows she knows (who knows love can endure)
And you know it will

When you see the Southern Cross for the first time
You understand now why you came this way
'Cause the truth you might be runnin' from is so small
But it's as big as the promise, the promise of a comin' day

So I'm sailing for tomorrow my dreams are a-dyin'
And my love is an anchor tied to you (tied with a silver chain)
I have my ship and all her flags are a-flyin'
She is all that I have left and music is her name

Think about
Think about how many times I have fallen
Spirits are using me, larger voices callin'
What Heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten

I have been around the world (I have been around the world)
Lookin' (lookin' for that woman girl)
(Who knows love can endure)
And you know it will
And you know it will

And we never failed to fail it was the easiest thing to do
You will survive being bested
Somebody fine will come along make me forget about loving you

David Crosby,"Look around me, I can see my life before me
Running rings around the way it used to be
I am older now I have more than what I wanted
But I wish that I had started long before I did

And there's so much time to make up everywhere you turn
Time we have wasted on the way
So much water moving underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away

Oh when you were young did you question all the answers
Did you envy all the dancers who had all the nerve?
Look round you know, you must go for what you wanted
Look at all my friends who did and got what they deserved

So much time to make up everywhere you turn
Time we have wasted on the way
So much water moving underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away

David Crosby,"I had a hard run, runnin' from your window
I was all night running, running, Lord, I wonder if you care
I had a run in, run around and run down
Run around the corner, corner, Lord, run smack in to a tree

I had to move, really had to move
That's why if you please, I am on my bendin' knees

Why don't you arrest me? Throw me in to the jail house

David Crosby,"Six o' clock
In the morning, I feel pretty good
So I dropped into the luxury of the Lords
Fighting dragons and crossing swords
With the people against the hordes
Who came to conquer.

Seven o'clock
In the morning, here it comes
I taste the warning and I am so amazed
I'm here today, seeing things so clear this way
In the car and on my way
To Stonehenge.

I'm flying in Winchester cathedral
Sunlight pouring through the break of day.
Stumbled through the door and into the chamber,
There's a lady setting flowers on a table covered lace
And a cleaner in the distance finds a cobweb on a face
And a feeling deep inside of me tells me
This can't be the place

I'm flying in Winchester cathedral.
All religion has to have its day
Expressions on the face of the Savior
Made me say
I can't stay.

Open up the gates of the church and let me out of here!
Too many people have lied in the name of Christ
For anyone to heed the call.
So many people have died in the name of Christ
That I can't believe it all.

And now I'm standing on the grave of a soldier that died in 1799
And the day he died it was a birthday
And I noticed it was mine.
And my head didn't know just who I was
And I went spinning back in time.
And I am high upon the altar
High upon the altar, high.

I'm flying in Winchester cathedral,
It's hard enough to drink the wine.
The air inside just hangs in delusion,
But given time,
I'll be fine.",Cathedral,2016

Nothing like this ever happened to me
I seem to react to a vague memory
This is the way that she said it could be
Having a magical child
As I stand before you, watching the love turn around in my eye
I've waited for so long for someone to care
I've waited for so long for someone aware
I've waited for so long for someone to share
Having a magical child
Really makes me wonder why I waited for so long to
Bring another life to this place
Then I finally realized I was watching myself grow up
Can you not see it in his face, your face
Really makes me wonder why I waited for so long to

David Crosby,"When the last rose of summer pricks my finger,
And the hot sun chills me to the bone,
When I can't hear the song for the singer,
And I can't tell my pillow from a stone,
I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
And sing me a song of my own,
I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
And sing me a song of my own.

When the last bolt of sunshine hits the mountain,
And the stars start to splatter in the sky,
When the moon hits the southwest horizon,
With the scream of an eagle on the fly,
I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
And listen to the ripples as they moan,
I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
And sing me a song of my own.

Black muddy river, roll on forever,
I don't care how deep or wide, if you've got another side,
Roll muddy river, roll muddy river, black muddy river, roll.

When it seems like the night will last forever,
And there's nothing left to do but count the years,
When the strings of my heart begin to sever,
And stones fall from my eyes instead of tears,
I will walk alone, by the black muddy river,
And dream me a dream of my own,
I will walk alone, by the black muddy river,
And sing me a song of my own, sing me a song of my own.",Black Muddy River,2018
David Crosby,"Look out of any window
Any morning, any evening, any day
Maybe the sun is shining
Birds are winging or
Rain is falling from a heavy sky,
What do you want me to do,
To do for you to see you through?
For this is all a dream we dreamed 
One afternoon long ago 
Walk out of any doorway
Feel your way, feel your way
Like the day before
Maybe you'll find direction
Around some corner
Where it's been waiting to meet you,
What do you want me to do,
To watch for you while you're sleeping?
Well please don't be surprised
When you find me dreaming too

Look into any eyes
You find by you, you can see 
Clear through to another day
Maybe been seen before 
Through other eyes on other days 
While going home,
What do you want me to do,
To do for you to see you through?
It's all a dream we dreamed 
One afternoon long ago

Walk into splintered sunlight
Inch your way through dead dreams
To another land
Maybe you're tired and broken
Your tongue is twisted
With words half spoken 
And thoughts unclear
What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through
A box of rain will ease the pain 
And love will see you through

Just a box of rain,
Wind and water,
Believe it if you need it,
If you don't just pass it on
Sun and shower,
Wind and rain,
In and out the window
Like a moth before a flame

And it's just a box of rain
I don't know who put it there
Believe it if you need it
Or leave it if you dare
And it's just a box of rain
Or a ribbon for your hair
Such a long long time to be gone 
And a short time to be there",Box of Rain,2018

All the birds that were singing are flown, except you alone.

In my time, i will roll, roll roll.

In a bed, in a bed, by the waterside i will lay my head.
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.

River going to take me, sing sweet and sleepy,
Sing me sweet and sleepy all the way back home.

Mama, mama many worlds I've come since i first left home.

Goin' home, goin' home, by the riverside i will rest my bones,
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.

On the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow.

Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door.
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea.

She comes from a town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter,
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water, and
She bears it away with a love that the river has taught her.

Let it flow, greatly grow, wide and clear.
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field,
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal,
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring,
Black dirt live again!
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing,
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his day measures more than the planting and growing

Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield.
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name,
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin.
Water bright as the sky from which it came,
And the name is on the earth that takes it in.
We will not speak but stand inside the rain,
And listen to the thunder shouting ""i am! i am! i am! i am.""

Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, You know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

West Texas cowboys, they was all around,
Wheat liquor and money, they loaded down,
So soon after payday, no one seemed ashamed,
You know my uncle, he starts playin' the game,
Hey! A hollow jack and the winner take the hand.

My uncle starts winning, the cowboys got sore,
One of them called him, and then two more,
Accused him of cheatin', oh no it couldn't be,
I know my uncle he's as honest as me,
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be.

One of them cowboys he starsts to draw,
And I shot him down Lord, He never saw,
Shot me another, Right then he hit the floor,
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold,
And we hightailed it down to Mexico.

When he got to moving, ten thousand was dead.

David Crosby,"Shaking in the forest, what have you to fear?
Here there may be tigers, to punch you in the ear.
With gloves of stainless steel, bats carved out of bricks
Knock you down and beat you up and give your ass a kick.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

Shaking in the desert, now wherefore do you cry?
Here there may be rattlesnakes, to punch you in the eye.
With shotgun's full of silver and bullet's made of glass
String barbed wire at your feet, that will not let you pass.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

When push comes to shove, when push comes to shove,
You're afraid of love, when push comes to shove.

Shaking in the bedroom, covers on your head,
Are you still in fear of the hand beneath the bed?
Grabbing at the handle, scratching at the door,
Maybe it's mystery killer you saw on channel four.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

Shaking in the garden, the fear within you grows,
Here there may be roses, to punch you in the nose.
Put my arms around you, love you til you cry,
Wrap you in your sweet perfume and squeeze you 'til you die.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

When push comes to shove, when push comes to shove,
You're afraid of love, when push comes to shove.",When Push Comes to Shove,2018

It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue.

Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city

Safely to arrive at home

Wondering from the fold of God
He, to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood

Daily I'm constrained to be
And let Thy goodness like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

Prone to leave the God I love

Seal it for Thy courts above

Save from wrath and make me pure.

Can fulfill thy law's commands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and thou alone.

Simply to the cross I cling;
Naked, come to thee for dress;
Helpless, look to thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Savior, or I die.

When mine eyes shall close in death,
When I soar to worlds unknown,

Interposed His precious blood

I am stained with dirt, prone to depravity

You are divinity

From the broken earth flowers come up 
Pushing through the dirt

You are holy, holy, holy
All heaven cries ""holy, holy God
You are holy, holy, holy
I want to be holy like You are

You are everything that is bright and clean
And You're covering me with Your majesty
And the truest sign of grace was this
From wounded hands redemption fell down
Liberating man
But the harder I try the more clearly can I feel
The depth of our fall and the weight of it all
And so this might could be the most impossible thing
Your grandness in me making me clean

David Crowder Band,"The first Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay:
In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star,
Shining in the east, beyond them far:
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from the country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

This star drew nigh to the north-west;
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

Then entered in those wise men three,
Fell reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in his presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the kind of Israel.

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
That hath made heaven and earth of nought,
And with his blood mankind has bought.

Because He lives all fear is gone
Because I know He holds the future
And life is worth the living just because He lives

I'll cross that river
I'll fight life's final war with pain
And then as death gives way to vict'ry
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know he lives

On my journey I pursue
Lord said I'm running, running for the city
I got the new world in my view

They ain't got no muscle, no hustle
No backbone, I stand alone
Not tripping, just saying, I'm different
Ain't hanging on the coattails of the next man
Passport in my left hand, thinking that you are next
Heck, hope you ain't holding your breath, man
Cause I'm out here, I'm hungry, I don't play around, trust me
Ain't hexed my drive since my Honda Civic got rusty
And my girl said she loved me, it's funny
Just thinking back, study hard for that 9 to 5
Like I thought that I'd be good with that
I was dreaming, still dreaming, spoil it on me like Willie Beaman
Still performing like Al Pachino, we stuck around in tuxedos
With my peoples, we growing up 'stead of seeing others slowing up
Tint squad, we throwing up, every time we showing up

Get it while I'm living
All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking
So I'm 'bout my business
And I'm running, I'm running
I'm running with you now

We gon' make it out

I'm running with them, yeah
They don't wanna give it up
We don't make them ask it

It don't get no greater, feel like I'm on fire
Feel like I'm Johnny Storm, feel like I'm volatile
Explosive, get close enough to notice
Your girl act out of character when she see me approaching
Ain't pouching I'm just saying it's nothing
You punching above your weight, I'm something
She ain't seen no substitute in that A team
That's B.A., Baracus, that BS, that whackness
Get no play in my axis, make 'em jump like AJ Hackett
Guarantee you in these boots they couldn't walk one mile
I really need to go and hang it up like a drunk dial
So behind the times they should probably rock a sundial
Shattering their dreams, I could make Big Pun smile
Music from the soul, don't need them to help me
If they fiending for the flash, they should take another selfie
Said I'm running, I'm running like Mo Farah so dapper
Swear the whole world could go against me, it don't matter, man

Get it while I'm living
All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking
So I'm 'bout my business

Won't wait another day
My plan is falling into place
We ain't got much to lose
I wanna taste
Won't wait another day

David Davidson,"I remember 
The night we met 
That night we sat 
Entwined 
Under summer skies 
I looked into your eyes 
You looked into mine 
You said ""you're not like the rest"" 
And I nodded 
""No one understands me"" 
you said 
And I nodded once again, 
As if to agree that all men are indeed the same 

Somehow, you said, I was different 
For months on end I maintained 
A veneer of sincere interest 
As if I were listening 
As you re-lived every page 
Of self help and new age that you had read 
And 
I went in for the kill 
I'd read the same books 
I learned to ape the motions of a 'sensitive' human being 

And we were 'oh so happy' 
But you found things to fix 
And I knew it was time 
To move on 
So now you have me completely figured out 
You feel sorry for me 
I can't express my feelings 
I can't tell the truth 
We are all alike 
At puberty I was sworn to secrecy 
By the international brotherhood 
Of lying fickle males 
I can't tell you anything 
And 
I can't commit 
You're right 
I can't commit, to you 

I will always cherish our time together 
I don't feel enough of anything 
To harbor the kind of distain that you'll maintain 
You painted me into what you wanted to see 
And that's fine 
But you will never know me",In Love,1998
David Davidson,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1999

Look up to the cross 
Stranded in the land of the lost 
Standin up, I'm sideways 
I'm blazin' up the path 
Runnin on the highways of rap 
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal 
Lava stamps and brands me like a barcode 
I'm Dashin all the meteor strikes 
Keep the media dykes 
As re-enforcements for the fight 
And that alone with keep John Ghotti on the phone 
Tangled in his own I got the bees on the track 
Where the fuck you at? 
Tical
Let me hear you pigeons run your mouth now 
Shut the fuck up!
I'm pluggin in them social skills 
That keep my total bills over a million 
The last time I checked it 
Thank God I'm blessed with the mind that I wreck it 
Wait until the second round, I'll knock him out 

They call me big John stud 
My middle name mud 
Dirty water flow 
Too much for you thugs 
That can't stand the flood 
What up doc? 
Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd 
The sure shot 
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged 
Learn 
Temperature's too hot for sunblock 
Burn 
Playin with minds can get you state time 
Lock behind twelve bars from a great mind 
Killa bees in the club when there's ladybug 
Brought a sword to tha dance floor to cut a rug 
Love is love all day 'til they both slug 
And take another life in cold blood 
Can't feel me?

Why risk it

Eight essential vitamins and minerals

Knocked out their front teethes

Dope fiendin for the baseline

Hard as nails to the cubicle 
Where you find that monster

Roll on the check 
Kick a hole in the speaker 
Pull the plug and inject 

Mic check 
So what's it all about? 
Where we gonna run? 
Maybe we can meet up on the sun 
Discretion is advised 
For the blood of virgin eyes 
Limpin on the track with Method 
So get the sunblock 
You get your one shot 
Until you dissolve 
I revolve around everything you got 
From outta nowhere prepare 
You'll be blinded by the glare 
I told you not to stare 
Now you're turned into stone 
Without a microphone

Until they swallow
Whisper things into my brain
Your voice sounds so hollow

I am not a leader of men
Since I prefer to follow
Do you think I could have a drink
Since it's so hard to swallow
So hard to swallow

So turn the television off
And I will sing a song
And if you suddenly have the urge
You can sing along

I touch your hand, I touch your face
I think the fruit is rotten
Give me lessons on how to breathe
Cause I think I've forgotten
I think I've forgotten

One day, up to a cliff
That overlooks the water
I jumped in to save a girl
It was somebody's daughter
And now the ring is on my hand
It was given to me by her
To this day we all sit around
And dream of ways to get higher
To get much higher

When every step I take is always too small
Maybe it's just something I can't admit but lately,
I feel like I don't give a shit

Accusations don't know how to take them
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration never hard to break it
Situation never what you want it to be

What's the point of never making mistakes
Self-indulgence is such a hard habit to break
It's all just a waste of time in the end
I don't care so why should I even pretend

I'm falling further behind, there's nothing to explain
No matter what you say nothing's gonna change my mind

Can't depend on doubt until the end

and though I can't pretend, afraid to be this way
It's not the same but who's to blame,

Our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet 
And so were you, Mam'selle

A kiss became a sigh
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle 
Just like wine does
No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you
And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry

Was the duel that was fought
To win a heart in Xanadu

Un atardecer en cualquier café
Mis palabras no tienen dueño
Que las quiera entender

Capitán sin fe de ""barcos de papel""
Remolino de pensamientos

Y que solitas se quedan las olas
Cuando el sol se agota
Y que solito me ""quedao"" esperandote
Buscando tu perdón

No supe que decir al verte allí
Mirandome sin prestarme atención
No supe que decir ""enamorao"" de ti
Voy pasando las horas
No supe que decir ni a que acudir
Quizás mujer merezca tu perdon
No tengo a donde ir y ""enamorao""de ti

Tus te quieros no los quiero
Si son de papel, ""barcos de papel""
Tu recuerdo ya lo llevo
""clavaito"" en mi piel

Ven y asomate a mi sensatez
No merezco ser tu dueño ni tampoco perder

la voz de un te quiero,
no hay palabras que expliquen,
la fuerza de los sentimientos,
de los sentimientos, que queman por dentro...
Recuerda,
que en la plazoleta quedan aun las huellas,
donde reflejaste tu niÃ±ez...
los buenos amigos huyen del olvido,
why se sientan a recorrer,
aventuras de nuestro ayer...
tu recuerda...
why siento anhelos de ese callejÃ³n del duende,
why siento celos de los labios que te besen,
why siento miedo de no haber llegao a tiempo,
a ver cumplido tus deseos...
Que el amor es como una cometa que se lleva el viento,
no te rindas por una condena ni salgas corriendo...
que el amor tiene solo un lenguaje,

Mejor por dentro, sin mirar atrás

Al antojo de la vida se me antoja a mi manera

Dame olor a ropa limpia
Dame tus manos sabias

Can't bite my tongue forever

You can hide behind your stories

You can tell me there's nobody else

And pretend all you want
But I know
I know your love is just a lie

You look so innocent
But the guilt in your voice gives you away
Yeah, you know what I mean
How does it feel when you kiss
When you know that I trust you?
And do you think about me when he fucks you?
And could you be more obscene?

So don't try to say you're sorry
Or try to make it right
And don't waste your breath

David Donatien,"Endless song of happiness

היא רק מרחפת
בעולם שלה לה לה לה לה
והוא מנסה לגעת
היא נרתעת
לא יודעת

אתה יושב בפינה
ומתבונן בה
בא בערב
מתרדמה מתעורר
רואה חלון פתוח
ולא בטוח

מה לה קרה
מה היא עשתה
פוחד שהיא קפצה
(צה)צה מבחוץ
היא עפה על ענן קטן
בנתה מגדל

שקוף במכחול
ובתוכו עפים
כל המלאכים
וכל הפיות הקטנות
רוקדןת במעגל מסתובב
בלי סוף...",The Endless Song of Happiness [Shir Haosher Hanitschi],2007
David Donatien,"Far, far, there's this little girl
She was praying for something to happen to her
Everyday she writes words and more words
Just to speak out the thoughts that keep floating inside
And she's strong when the dreams come 'cause they
Take her, cover her, they are all over
The reality looks far now, but don't go

How can you stay outside?
There's a beautiful mess inside
How can you stay outside?
There's a beautiful mess inside
Hmm, hmm
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Far, far, there's this little girl
She was praying for something good to happen to her
From time to time there aree colors and shapes
Dazzling her eyes, tickling her hands
They invent her a new world with
Oil skies and aquarelle rivers
But don't you run away already
Please don't go, oh, oh

How can you stay outside?
There's a beautiful mess inside
How can you stay outside?
There's a beautiful mess inside
Take a deep breath and dive
There's a beautiful mess inside
How can you stay outside?
There's a beautiful mess inside

Beautiful
Beautiful

Far, far there's this little girl
She was praying for something big to happen to her
Every night she ears beautiful strange music
It's everywhere there's nowhere to hide
But if it fades, she begs
""Oh Lord, don't take it from me, don't take it yourselves""

I guess I'll have to give it birth
To give it birth
I guess, I guess, I guess I have to give it birth
I guess I have to, have to give it birth
There's a beautiful mess inside and it's everywhere

So shake it yourself now deep inside
Deeper than you ever dared
Deeper than you ever dared
There's a beautiful mess inside
Beautiful mess inside",Far Far,2007
David Donatien,"I wanted wings
To the horizon meanwhile
I wanted to approach
The other side of the rainbow

Let him dream, human being
He needs to dream
Let him breathe, human being
Asking to breathe

I have sadness and suddenly
I want to sail on the water
I have magic and suddenly
I want to fly to the sky

I have time
To look and dream
Upon the day, the other day
And the day after tomorrow

I wanted to touch
Our bliss
I wanted to know
Where we came from

Let her laugh, human being
She needs to laugh
Let her see your heart
It wants to live",Lachlom,2007
David Donatien,"Combien de colères j'ai gardé spécialement pr toi.
Tu m'es cher.
Combien d'amertume j'ai accumulé pour toi .
Tu es ce qui m'est de plus cher.
Je voulais aprendre à renoncer à toi.
Combien de pensées.
Séparation, haine, mais dans tout ça l'amour fleurit.
Combien d'histoires au fils des ans, si seulement j'avais su à quel point je suis transparente pour toi.
J'aurais voulu savoir te mentir...
Combien de fois tu m'as pardonnée, est ce que moi aussi je t'ai pardonné.
Justement ce sont les mots clairs, qui m'ont échappé de la bouche.

I am here with you
Even when you're scared

To enchain you
But you open your eyes to the sky
And whisper

That you are so lonely
You are so alone
You're so alone
You're so lonely, so lonely

So I'm coloring my face
While I am here with you
Imagining the landscape of your sorrow
Is it yellow or blue?

Coloring the sky, and the trees
And the clouds, and the moonlight
I'd colored your heart
If you didn't I did

Outside myself
You see I was pretending
To be someone else
I was longing to see
Who I wanted to be

And I've been waiting on my own
I've been waiting for too long
Not strong enough to be with you
And I've been making up my world
I've been painting it with gold
Not strong enough to see you

I irrigate illusions
Then let them grow
How can I pacify myself?
And let go
And I ran wild to see
Who I turned out to be

David Donatien,"I’m flying far away to be really free
tried hard to build myself independently 
it's hard to always do what you expect from me 
saying come home
come home 

i try to understand why it hurts you 
to see the difference in our points of view  
don't blame me for a thing that I didn't do 
saying come home
come home  

it's insane 
how feeling so much shame 
will only bring you pain 
and I no longer know how to explain 
see i'm happy as can be 
and you're my family, my ground  
and i'm just hoping one day i will find you  

you're holding back the tears when you kiss me 
smile smile when i'm back again as you see me  
when years are passing by and you miss me 
you're saying come home 
come home

such a shame 
you're feeling so much blame 
and yet i'm still the same 
and i no longer know how to explain 
see i’m grateful as can be 
'cause you’re my family, i'm bound 
and i'm just hoping one day you will shine through  

let's try to look at each other 
find one another 
asking how can it be 
fighting and loosing each other 
thinking the other 
is not so much like me 
finding out all that we see
is just not always what is real  

that you come home
come home
just come home
come home 

my turn to understand what you lived through 
today i only feel how i miss you  
so it's only fare, when it's hard to bare  
and you ask if i, i try to come home 
come home",Come Home,2010
David Donatien,"when you feel ashamed, go to the river
when you're feeling sad, go to the river
when you're feeling blue inside, immersed and tied
when you're feeling stuck in pain, forever

sigh and sigh inside you long for
more, more of the life you had be-
fore fore fore, let the seasons
arrive and dive let the winter snow and
glow, glow, when the wind will blow just
flow, flow, eventually you will know

go go, you should go

when you're feeling bad, go to the river
when you're feeling mad, go to the river
when you feel it blows your mind
‘cause you can’t find
when you feel you're going blind
you can’t deny

go go go with the river flow you
hide hide hide, but the river gets wide don’t
row, row, with everything you
know, know, know, all you've carried inside
side side, let the water unwind don't
fight, fight, the river is right
let go, go, eventually you will grow

when you feel you'll lose your mind
they'll let you slide
when you feel you go insane
they let you die

go go, the river will know
blow blow, the river will blow
go go, the wind will sigh
blow blow, the leaves can die
go go, the seeds will grow
blow blow, the river will slow
go go, the years go by
blow blow, with the river go

go go go go in your soul you
try to fly but never get high you're
low, low, wishing for the
tide to rise, hold your feelings inside
side side side,
let the river glide and
slow, slow, the winter will go you
know know know, with everything you'll grow
whatever comes will go


go go go down the river below you
sigh sigh sigh, and the years go by and
so, so, the leaves will fall but
more more more, you wanted even more just

can’t decide, ‘cause the river gets wild you

you sacrifice and lie 
the reason we continue to deny

She went down to Tampa
In an Eldorado Grand

She wrote back dear mama
Life is just heaven in the sun
From small things Mama, big things one day come

Well, she shot him dead on a sunny Florida road
And when they caught her all she said
Was she couldn't stand the way he drove

Back home, dear Johnny prays for his Betty's parole
He waits high on the hillside where the lonely waters roll
At his feet and almost grown now
Blue eyed daughter and a handsome son

Well from small things Mama, big things one day come

David Downes,"The mist has cleared from Muckish Hill
Our parting coming nearer
The last embrace, the final touch
With nothing more to say
Nothing more to say

As silence fell around the bridge
Not a single word was spoken
A bitter breeze, a lonely stream
Echoed through the Glen
Echoed through the Glen

Droichead na ndeor
Agus droichead na gcaointe
Droichead na gcaointe
Agus droichead na ndeor

Memories fade with passing age
In forlorn hope we wait for
Distant hills still haunt us now
Until the end of time
Until the end of time

David Draiman,"I'm over it
You see I'm falling in the vast abyss
Clouded by memories of the past
At last I see

I hear it fading, I can't speak it
Or else you will dig my grave
You feel them finding, always whining
Take my hand now be alive

You see I cannot be forsaken
Because I'm not the only one
We walk amongst you feeding, raping
Must we hide from everyone?

I'm over it
Why can't we be together embrace it?
Sleeping so long taking off the mask
At last I see

My fear is fading, I can't speak it
Or else you will dig my grave
You feel them finding, always whining
Take my hand now be alive

Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage run through my head
Patterns of my live have thawed and torn me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament
Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me
A bitter fear at the thought of my amends
Hoping that the step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this un-swept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development
We will be amazed before we are halfway through.
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.
We will comprehend the word serenity, and we will know peace
No matter how far down the scale we have gone.
We will see how our experience can benefit others.
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.
We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.
Self-seeking will slip away.
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.
Fear of people and economic insecurity will leave us.
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.
Are these extravagant promises? We think not.
They have been fulfilled amongst others
Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.
We will always be true to our principles.

But the truth shall set you free.

David Essex,"What a dream I had
Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline of smoky burgundy
Softer than the rain
I wandered empty streets
Down past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alley ways
As I walked on

And when you ran to me
Your cheeks flushed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand

And when I awoke and felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair with my grateful tears

David Essex,"The hammering from the pit and the pounding of guns grew louder. My fear rose at the sound of someone creeping into the house. Then I saw it was a young artilleryman, weary, streaked with blood and dirt.

      Artilleryman: Anyone here?
      Journalist: Come in. Here, drink this.
      Artilleryman: Thank you.
      Journalist: What's happened?
      Artilleryman: They wiped us out. Hundreds dead, maybe thousands.
      Journalist: The heat ray?
      Artilleryman: The Martians. They were inside the hoods of machines they'd made, massive metal things on legs. Giant machines that walked. They attacked us. They wiped us out.
      Journalist: Machines?
      Artilleryman: Fighting machines, picking up men and bashing them against trees. Just hunks of metal, but they knew exactly what they were doing.
      Journalist: Hmm. There was another cylinder came last night.
      Artilleryman: Yes. Yes, it looked bound for London.

London! Carrie! I hadn't dreamed there could be danger to Carrie and her father, so many miles away.

      Journalist: I must go to London at once.
      Artilleryman: And me, got to report to headquarters, if there's anything left of it.

At Byfleet, we came upon an inn, but it was deserted.

      Artilleryman: Is everybody dead?
      Journalist: Not everybody, look... 

Six cannons with gunners standing by.

      Artilleryman: Bows and arrows against the lightning.
      Journalist: Hmm.
      Artilleryman: They haven't seen the heat ray yet. 

We hurried along the road to Weybridge. Suddenly, there was a heavy explosion and gusts of smoke erupted into the air.

      Artilleryman: Look! There they are! What did I tell you!

Quickly, one after the other, four of the fighting machines appeared. Monstrous tripods, higher than the tallest steeple, striding over the pine trees and smashing them, walking tripods of glittering metal. Each carried a huge funnel and I realized with horror that I'd seen this awful thing before.
A fifth machine appeared on the far bank. It raised itself to full height, flourished the funnel high in the air, and the ghostly terrible heat ray struck the town.
As it struck, all five fighting machines exulted, emitting deafening howls which roared like thunder:

      Martians: Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla!

The six guns we had seen now fired simultaneously, decapitating a fighting machine. The Martian inside the hood was slain, splashed to the four winds, and the body, nothing now but an intricate device of metal, went whirling to destruction. As the other monsters advanced, people ran away blindly, the artilleryman among them, but I jumped into the water and hid until forced up to breathe. Now the guns spoke again, but this time the heat ray sent them to oblivion.
With a white flash the heat ray swept across the river. Scalded, half blinded and agonized, I staggered through leaping, hissing water towards the shore. I fell in full sight of the Martians, expecting nothing but death. The foot of a fighting machine came down close to my head, then lifted again as the four Martians carried away the debris of their fallen comrade, and I realized that by a miracle, I had escaped.

      Martians: Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla!",The Artilleryman and the Fighting Machine,1981
David Essex,"Artilleryman: We're gonna build a whole new world for ourselves. Look, they clap eyes on us and we're dead, right? So, we gotta make a new life where they'll never find us. You know where? Underground. You should see it down there, hundreds of miles of drains, sweet and clean now after the rain, dark, quiet, safe. We can build houses and everything, start again from scratch. And what's so bad about living underground, eh? S'not been so great living up here, if you want my opinion.

Brave New World

      Artilleryman
      Take a look around you at the world we've come to know
      Does it seem to be much more than a crazy circus show
      Maybe from the madness, something beautiful will grow
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start... we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!

      Artilleryman: We'll build shops and hospitals and barracks, right under their noses, right under their feet. Everything we need: banks, prisons and schools. We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and then like you we'll teach the kids. Not poems and rubbish; science, so we can get everything working! We'll build villages and towns, and... and we'll play each other at cricket! Listen, maybe one day we'll capture a fighting machine, eh, learn how to make 'em ourselves, and then: WALLOP! Our turn to do some wiping out! WHOOSH! With our heat ray! Whoosh! And them running and dying, beaten at their own game, man on top again!

      Artilleryman
      Now our domination of the earth is fading fast,
      And out of the confusion a chance has come at last,
      To build a better future from the ashes of the past,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      Look, man is born in freedom, but he soon becomes a slave,
      In cages of convention from the cradle to the grave,
      The weak fall by the wayside but the strong will be saved,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...
      But if mankind is to survive, the people life alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      And it's going to have to start with me and you... YES!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...
      But if mankind is to survive, the people left alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      Yes and we will have to be the chosen few...

      Just think of all the poverty, the hatred and the lies,
      And imagine the destruction of all that you despise,
      Slowly from the ashes the phoenix will arise,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men
      We'll start all over again!

      Take a look around you at the world you've loved so well,
      And bid the aging empire of man a last farewell
      It may not sound like heaven but at least it isn't hell
      It's a brave new world with just a handful of men,
      We'll start, we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!
      I'VE GOT A PLAN!

      Artilleryman: Can't you just see it? Civilization starting all over again! A second chance! Heh- we'll even build a railway and tunnel to the coast, go there for our holidays! Nothing can stop men like us! I've made a start already. Come on down here and have a look.

In the cellar there was a tunnel scarcely ten yards long. It had taken him a week to dig. I could have dug that much in a day, and I suddenly had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his power.

      Artilleryman: It's doing the working and the thinking that wears a fellow out. I'm ready for a bit of a rest. How about a drink, eh? Nothing but champagne now I'm the boss.

We drank, and then he insisted upon playing cards. With our species on the edge of extermination, with no prospect but a horrible death, we actually played games. Later he talked more of his plan, but I saw flames flashing in the deep blue night, red weed glowing, tripod figures moving distantly, and I put down my champagne glass. I felt a traitor to my kind, and I knew I must leave this strange dreamer.

David Essex,"You called me from the room in your hotel
All full of romance for someone that you met
And telling me how sorry you were, leaving so soon
And that you miss me sometimes when you're alone in your room
Do I feel lonely too?

You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
We can't go on just holding on to time
Now that we're living separate lives

Well I held on to let you go
And if you lost your love for me, well you never let it show
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living (living)
Separate lives

Ooh, it's so typical, love leads to isolation
So you build that wall (build that wall)
Yes, you build that wall (build that wall)
And you make it stronger

Well you have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
Some day I might (I might) find myself looking in your eyes
But for now, we'll go on living separate lives
Yes for now, we'll go on living separate lives
Separate lives",Separate Lives,2000

Funeral. She sings as the voice of the dead Evita)

Sing you fools! But you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
She's not coming back to you
Show business kept us all alive
Since 17 October 1945
But the star has gone, the glamour's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in
Instead of government we had a stage
Instead of ideas a prima donna's rage
Instead of help we were given a crowd
She didn't say much but she said it loud
And who am I who dares to keep
His head held high while millions weep?
Why the exception to the rule?
Opportunist? Traitor? Fool?
Or just a man who grew and saw
From seventeen to twenty-four
His country bled, crucified?
She's not the only one who's died!
Sing you fools? But you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through

Don't cry for me Argentina
For I am ordinary, unimportant
And undeserving of such attention
Unless we all are--I think we all are
Ride on my train o my people
And when it's your turn to die you'll remember
They fired those cannons, sang lamentations

David Essex,"High flying, adored, so young, the instant queen
A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl 
Hustling and fighting 
Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree 

High flying, adored, that's good to hear, but unimportant 
My story's quite usual, local girl makes good, weds famous man 
I was slap in the right place at the perfect time
Filled a gap--I was lucky 
But one thing I'll say for me 
No-one else can fill it like I can","High, Flying Adored",2002
David Essex,"The nights are colder now 
Maybe I should close the door 
And anyway the snow has covered all your footsteps 
And I can follow you no more 

The fire still burns at night 
My memories are warm and clear 
But everybody knows It's hard to be alone at this time of year 
It was only a winter's tale 

Just another winter's tale 
And why should the world take notice 
Of one more love that's failed 
(It's)a love that can never be 

Though we meant to love to 
You and me 
On a worldwide scale 
We're just another winter's tale 

Why I stand alone 
A bell is ringing far away I wonder if you hear 
I wonder if you listening 
I wonder where you are today 

Good luck, I wish you well 
For all that wishes may be worth 
I hope that love and strength 
are with you for the length of your time on earth",A Winter's Tale [DVD],2005

Soldier of only you can do what must be done.
You know, in some ways you're a lot like me.
You're just a prisoner, and you're tryin' to break free.

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky.
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher.
Gonna be your man in motion.
All I need is a pair of wheels.
Take me where the future's lying: St. Elmo's fire.

Burning up; don't know just how far that I can go.
Soon be home; only just a few miles down the road.
And I can make it, I know I can.
You broke the boy in me, but you won't break the man.

Now we never talk
We never walk outside

I look out the window
And see the streets below
Cars and the people
Lonely church steeple surrounded by gray
We need to move away

Here we go over and over and over
You're talking about it again
Let's move out, relocate
This place is in a state
Let's buy a pig or a hen

We need some open space
We need a change of pace

So life here in town girl
Is getting you down
And you long for a change
But won't it seem strange with fields all around?
We won't hear a sound

The grass may be greener
The air may be cleaner
But I love the city
I know it's not pretty
But at least there is life
You call this life?

Here we go over and over and over
You're talking about it again
Let's move out, relocate
This place is in a state
Let's buy a pig or a hen

We need some open space
We need a change of pace

Stars shine bright
In the country
Life feels right
Won't you trust me?

Hand me the remote
I'm not sure that we'd cope
In the middle of nowhere
Surrounded by fresh air
I'd miss my mates
This place is a state

You'd do your work from home
Online or on the phone
I could grow vegetables
Sounds like a load of balls
Let's relocate
I said, I'd miss my mates

Here we go over and over and over
You're talking about it again

I could tell you something now, you think twice about it tomorrow

Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)

Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

And stares at me
These two teeth are
Gone as you can see
I don't know just who
To blame for this catastrophe
But my one wish on Christmas Eve
Is as plain as it can be

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
See my two front teeth

Gee, if I could only
Have my two front teeth
Then I could with you
""Merry Christmas.""
It seems so long since I could say
""Sister Susie sitting on a thistle!""

Gosh oh gee, how happy I'd be
If I could only whistle (thh)

Is my two front teeth

See my two front teeth

Gee, if I could only
Have my two front teeth

David Fonseca,"Foi sem mais nem menos
Que um dia selei a 125 azul
Foi sem mais nem menos
Que me deu para abalar sem destino nenhum

Foi sem graça nem pensando na desgraça
Que eu entrei pelo calor
Sem pendura que a vida já me foi dura
P'ra insistir na companhia

O tempo não me diz nada
Nem o homem da portagem na entrada da auto-estrada
A ponte ficou deserta nem sei mesmo se Lisboa
Não partiu para parte incerta
Viva o espaço que me fica pela frente e não me deixa recuar
Sem paredes, sem ter portas nem janelas
Nem muros para derrubar

Talvez um dia me encontre
Assim talvez me encontre

Curiosamente dou por mim pensando onde isto me vai levar
De uma forma ou outra há-de haver uma hora para a vontade de parar
Só que à frente o bailado do calor vai-me arrastando para o vazio
E com o ar na cara, vou sentindo desafios que nunca ninguém sentiu

Talvez um dia me encontre
Assim talvez me encontre

Entre as dúvidas do que sou e onde quero chegar
Um ponto preto quebra-me a solidão do olhar
Será que existe em mim um passaporte para sonhar
E a fúria de viver é mesmo fúria de acabar

Foi sem mais nem menos
Que um dia selou a 125 azul
Foi sem mais nem menos
Que partiu sem destino nenhum
Foi com esperança sem ligar muita importância àquilo que a vida quer
Foi com força acabar por se encontrar naquilo que ninguém quer

Mas Deus leva os que ama
Só Deus tem os que mais ama",125 Azul,2000

David Ford,"Darling don't wake from your sleep
There's just commercials and war on tv
The dam, is it breeched, so it seems
And there are footsteps, and they're coming for me
So close your eyes and sleep

Here comes a hurricane
Here comes the flood
Here comes a tidal wave of land sliding mud
It's never enough
To make me repent all these things I have done

It feels like a neutral's been wired to the live
I feel like some hero been doomed to survive
And it's never enough
To shake the foundations and rattle the walls

So book me a seat and I'm along for the ride
Now is the age to just let it all slide
And it's never enough 
To ask any difficult questions oh

And who gives a damn if this conspiracy's real
There's a whole generation asleep at the wheel
And it's never enough
Let the hard times roll, no we're not in control
And we'd be crazy to think that we are.

No death or glory,no line in the sand
Blaze up these fireworks and strike up the band
And it's never enough 
And this is no time to stand up and be counted

God bless America God save the queen
God kill my enemies and keep my hands clean
It's never enough 
And this medications not wearing off any time soon

Well this land is your land, this land is mine
Now pull up a chair and we can watch the decline
And it's never enough 
The surroundings are just too damn comfortable here

This progress is a twentyfirst century curse
The times they are changing and they'll change for the worst
And it's never enough

This time I'm trying not to go to far, 'cause
No matter how it starts it ends the same
Someone's always doing someone more
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain
It's only gonna happen again

It's the fallinÂ'in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallinÂ'in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
All night...all night

And though I'm trying not to look in you're eyes
Each time I do they kind of burn right through me
Don't want to lay down in a bed full of lies
And yet my heart is saying, Â'Come and do meÂ'
Now we're just a web of mystery
A possibility of more to come
I'd rather leave the fantasy of what might be
But here I go falling again

It's the fallinÂ'in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallinÂ'in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
Over you...over you ( all night )

You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

I'm everything I am
Because you loved me",Because You Loved Me,2003
David Foster,"I can see the pain living in your eyes
And I know how hard you try
You deserve to have so much more
I can feel your heart and I sympathize
And I'll never criticize all you've ever meant to my life

I don't want to let you down
I don't want to lead you on
I don't want to hold you back
From where you might belong
You would never ask me why
My heart is so disguised
I just can't live a lie anymore
I would rather hurt myself
Than to ever make you cry
There's nothing left to say but good-bye
You deserve the chance at the kind of love
I'm not sure I'm worthy of
Losing you is painful to me


(Chorus) You would never ask me why
My heart is so disguised
I just can't live a lie anymore
I would rather hurt myself
Than to ever make you cry
There's nothing left to try
Though it's gonna hurt us both
There's no other way than to say good-bye",Goodbye,2003
David Foster,"Did you really think that
I would really take you back
Let you back in my heart
One more time, oh, no no

Did you think I'd still care
That there'd be more feeling there
Did you think you could walk back
In my life, oh

So you found you missed the love you threw away
Baby, but you found it out too late, too late

And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Oh baby, now, I learned from you

I remember cold nights
Tears I thought would never dry
How you shattered my world
With your goodbye, your goodbye

Would a sold my soul then
Just to have you back again
Now you are the last thing on my mind

Now you say you're sorry and you've
Changed your ways
Sorry but you changed your ways too late

And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Oh baby, now, I learned from you

So when all you've got are sleepless night
When those tears are clouding up your eyes
Just remember it was you
Who said goodbye, who said goodbye

And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Oh baby, now, I learned from you

I learned from the best
I learned from you",I Learned from the Best,2003
