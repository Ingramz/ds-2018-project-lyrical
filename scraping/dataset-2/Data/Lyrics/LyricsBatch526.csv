Kante,"Der Tag klingt aus
Die Dunkelheit bricht ein
Das Haus steht still
Wir sind allein
Die Nacht liegt schwer
Um uns herum
Ein stiller Schmerz
Hält uns noch wach

Kein Tag der die Wunden
Zu heilen vermag
Uns bleibt ein Versprechen
Uns nicht zu verlieren
Im Grauen des Morgens
Im Schweren der Stunden
Die über uns brechen
Früh oder später

Der Mond steht hoch
In dieser Nacht
Zweilicht fällt
Auf Dein Gesicht
Ich seh' Dich an
Und denk daran
Wie schön es ist",Zweilicht,2001
Kante,"Moon, stars and planes
Cool cars and trains
Take away my pain
Moon, stars and planes","Moon, Stars and Planes",2004
Kante,"Wenn alles ruhig und dunkel wird
und Du mit Dir alleine bist
wenn in der Welt, die Dich umgibt
jeder vertraute Glanz erlischt

Wenn Du wo Du zuhause bist
Dich wie ein Gast, ein Fremder fühlst
mit gekauften Passpapieren
und schlecht gefälschtem Lebenslauf
wenn die Bücher im Regal
und die Musik, mit der Du lebst
auf einmal schal und billig wird

Wenn Du Dich reden hörst und denkst
dass nur Berechnung darin ist
und dass Du wenn Du ehrlich bist
nicht wirklich viel zu sagen hast
wenn alles was dir wichtig ist
so erscheint als hätte das
mit Dir im Grunde nichts zu tun

Dann weisst Du eines ganz genau
dann weisst Du eines ganz genau
auch wenn's Dir anders lieber wär:
dass das einfach die Wahrheit ist

Wenn Du die Du für Freunde hälst
die Du bewunderst und verehrst
vor Deinen Augen lügen hörst
und ohne Würde scheitern siehst
wenn Du nur ihre Eitelkeit
und nichts mehr Liebenswertes siehst
und nichtmal Mitleid für sie spürst

Dann weisst Du eines ganz genau
dann weisst Du eines ganz genau
auch wenns dir anders lieber wär:
dass das einfach die Wahrheit ist
und auch ein wenig lächerlich

Wenn Deine Eltern, die Du liebst
die immer alles für Dich waren
Dir nur noch lächerlich erscheinen
weil sie so alt und hilflos sind

Wenn die Person mit der Du lebst
Dich immer weniger versteht
und die Person mit der Du schläfst
Dich auf einmal nicht mehr erregt
wenn Deine Tränen nicht mehr kommen
weil Du Dich für Dich selber schämst
und selbst die Tränen fremd erscheinen

Dann weisst Du eines ganz genau
dann weisst Du eines ganz genau
auch wenns dir anders lieber wär:
dass das einfach die Wahrheit ist
und auch ein wenig lächerlich

Wenn jemand sagt, dass er das kennt
und dass Du nicht alleine bist
dass die Gespenster wieder gehen
wenn es wieder Morgen ist
dass er bis dahin bei Dir bleibt
dass er Dir Trost und Nähe gibt
und wenn er sagt, dass er Dich liebt

Dann weisst Du eines ganz genau
dann weisst Du eines ganz genau
das eine weisst Du ganz genau:
dass das einfach die Wahrheit ist
und auch ein wenig lächerlich",Die Wahrheit,2006
Kanui & Lula,"I want to go back to my little grass shack in Kealakekua, Hawaii

Kany García,"La primavera se apuntó a la última ronda
En ese tiempo solo andaba para mí
Salía lento de unas sábanas vencidas
De las luces y las sombras de mi vida

Billete de ida hacia un invierno consentido
Tengo grabado todo lo que sé de ti
Algunas noches me escapé a dormir contigo
Tú bien sabes lo que digo, yo también te he visto aquí

Busque mil formas diferentes
Mil formas y otras de olvidarte
Pero en ninguna me encontré, no supe desobedecerme
Busqué mil formas diferentes
En todas te puse delante
Pero en ninguna descansé, no supe desobedecerme
No supe desobedecerme

Nunca el pecado resultó tan excitante
La vida nunca se detiene ante tus pies
El equilibrio que una vez eché de menos
Me espera en un tablero de ajedrez

Busque mil formas diferentes
Mil formas y otras de olvidarte
Pero en ninguna me encontré, no supe desobedecerme

Kany García,"Hace ya varios dias
Que me siento
En el parque aquel
Me distrae ver los niños
Tomando una taza de cafe
Algunos les dan comida a las palomas
Otros solo les columpian largas horas
Otros solo estaran aqui de paso y nada mas
Hoy si no veo mal
Hay alguien que hace dia ya no esta

A donde fue Cecilia?
Ya no la veo en el parque aquel
Jugaba a escondidas
Siempre te guardaba una sonrisa
A donde fue Cecilia?

No la veo desde aquel atardecer
Dicen que le compraron un helado
Y en secreto debio haberselo ganado
Entregando sus manitas y sus piel
Siendo mas lo que le han robado

A donde fue Cecilia?
A donde fue tu niña
Hoy con alma de mujer
Uh, uh

Hace ya unas semanas que me siento
Solamente a ver si es que con toda su gracia
Se volviese a aparecer y no puedo pensar
Que a sus siete años alguien podria desear
Hacerle daño y que anda por las calles
De encubierto sin saber que le roba la inocencia
Descargando su violencia

A donde fue Cecilia?
Ya no la veo en el parque aquel
Dicen que le compraron un helado
Y en secreto debio haberselo ganado
Entregando sus manitas y sus piel
Siendo mas lo que le han robado

A donde fue Cecilia?
A donde fue tu niña
Hoy con alma de mujer

Si es que solo hubiece sido una historia que conte
Pero ella no esta sola
Si es que este silencio
Se rompiera para hablar de lo que ves
Se salvaria otra

A donde fue Cecilia?
A donde fue tu niña
Hoy con alma de mujer

A donde fue
A donde fue

Kany García,"Llevo dias leyendo tus cartas
Preguntandome porque me enamoré de ti?
Pues yo misma me decia: no lo pierdas
Sin pensar que nada valia la pena
Porque fue que pensé en ti cuando no eras para mi?
Pero todo se contestó en una conversacion
Quiero darte la explicacion:

Que fui a una tienda
Que lo que he comprado
Me sirve mejor que el estar a tu lado
Que dos baterias me han funcionado
Mejor que tus besos why que tus abrazos
Ya no diré yo mas nunca te extraño
Pues no me hacen falta ya mas tus engaños
Para dar migajas why hacerme mas daño
Mejor soy feliz
Con mi amigo en el baño

Unas le dicen consolador
Otros le llaman amigo
Solo sé que con él llego
A donde yo finji contigo
Si antes me hubiese enterado
De este tesoro existente
No me hubiese interesado
Tu amigo el impotente
Si no entiendes mi cancion
O no comprendes la razon
Para no llamarte why buscarte
Hoy quiero contarte

Que fui a una tienda
Que lo que he comprado
Me sirve mejor que el estar a tu lado
Que dos baterias me han funcionado
Mejor que tus besos why que tus abrazos
Ya no diré yo mas nunca te extraño
Pues no me hacen falta ya mas tus engaños
Para dar migajas why hacerme mas daño
Mejor soy feliz
Con mi amigo en el baño

Quien diria que seria tan facil
Reponerme de tu condicion
Hoy disfruto lo mejor de mis dias
Porque él nunca dice no no no

Yo fui a una tienda
Why lo que he comprado
Me sirve mejor que el estar a tu lado
Que dos baterias me han funcionado
Mejor que tus besos why que tus abrazos
Ya no diré yo mas nunca te extraño
Pues no me hacen falta ya mas tus engaños
Para dar migajas why hacerme mas daño
Mejor soy feliz
Con mi amigo en el baño
Si
Ya lo sé
Con mi amigo en el baño
Soy feliz
Volvi a vivir
Ya no tengo porque finjir
No no no
Con mi amigo en el baño

Kany García,"Carla es la eterna novia que lleva José
No existe tarde en que no le haga café
Y en cambio el no pasa noches sin calor
Pues Carla siempre satisface su pasión con

Y con el tiempo fue abriéndose la herida
Ella cerróo las otras puertas de su vida
El preparó maletas pa' vivir su sueño
Y no pensó lo que esperaba a su regreso

Carla se fue, a despertar
Carla se ha ido a bailar a la ciudad
Carla se fue, y no volverá, no, no
Se ha reunido con su hermana, libertad
(Muchos no)

En estas calles me he encontrado a José
Y en su rostro siempre encuentro un gran dolor
Pues hoy recurre a aquellos frutos que sembró
Y nunca supo todo lo que ella lloróo

Y quien diría que algún día en su partida
Ella recobra su valor, también su vida
Encuentra que no hace falta explicación
Hace una nota y dice, ""Carla falleció, bye, bye""

Carla se fue, al despertar
Carla se ha ido a bailar a la ciudad
Carla se fue, y no volverá, no, no
Se ha reunido con su hermana, libertad
(Muchos no)

Carla se fue y no mira atrás
Si nunca piensa regresar
Se hizo más fuerte y su galán no llora
Y dice solo ""Ay, ay, ay, ay""""

Carla se fue, al despertar
Carla se ha ido a bailar a la ciudad
Carla se fue, y no volverá, no, no

Kany García,"Hoy ya no sé dónde,
Guardo tus recuerdos,
Porque siempre el viento los regresa.

Ya sé que el tiempo ha dado su sentencia,
Lo nuestro ya es pasado,
Pero no sé qué hacer.

Con esta soledad
Que me abarca why me ahoga,
Que me lleva a un abismo
Why allí caigo a un espacio en que no hay luz

Con esta soledad,
Buscaré mil razones,
Para un día olvidar que te has ido,
Pero hoy lloraré el vacio,
Que deja tu adiós.

Hice algunas cartas donde esta tu nombre,
Pero de qué valen los intentos
Why hoy con el corazón tan desolado
Sabiendo que te he amado,
Hoy tendre que luchar.

Con esta soledad
Que me abarca why me ahoga,
Que me lleva a un abismo
Why allí caigo a un espacio en que no hay luz

Con esta soledad,
Buscaré mil razones,
Para un día olvidar que te has ido,
Pero hoy lloraré el vacio,
Que deja tu adiós.

Caminaré sin dudar
Why lucharé hasta el final
Why viviré,
Yo se que sonreiré,
Pero hoy que me haré.

Con esta soledad
Que me abarca why me ahoga,
Que me lleva a un abismo
Why allí caigo a un espacio en que no hay luz

Con esta soledad,
Buscaré mil razones,
Para un día olvidar que te has ido,
Pero hoy lloraré el vacio,
Que deja tu adiós.",Esta Soledad,2007
Kany García,"Si miro al cielo
Siempre encuentro consuelo
Porque aunque tú estés lejos
Es el mismo techo

Si escribo poemas en que
Hable de tus recuerdos
Sé que tu oracion en respuesta
Es pierdes tu tiempo

why el mismo no es en vano
He vivido demasiado
Aún con tanta historia
Tú estás, why permanecerás

Te abrazaré
Why te besare en mis sueños
Despertare, mojada en tu recuerdo

Caminaré sabiendo que un día
Estuve entre tus dedos

Seras mi estigma de amor
Pues te tuve why perdí tu vuelo

Mirando entre las calles
Yo hallé tu silueta
Why voy desesperadamente
A entregarte un abrazo

No llego a la esquina del tren
A enfrentar mi fracaso
Por miedo a saber quien es ella
Que hoy coge tu mano

El tiempo no es en vano
He vivido demasiado
Aún con tanta historia
Tu estas, why permanecerás

Te abrazaré
Why te besare en mis sueños
Despertare, mojada en tu recuerdo

Caminaré sabiendo que un día
Estuve entre tus dedos

Seras mi estigma de amor
Pues te tuve why perdí tu vuelo

Que dificil es borrar
Memorias más allá del cuerpo
Convertiste el amor en todo un misterio

why aunque ya no estés, no importa
Ya solo basta con saberlo

Te abrazaré
Why te besare en mis sueños
Despertare, mojada, mojada en tu recuerdo

Caminaré sabiendo que un día
Estuve entre tus dedos

Seras mi estigma de amor
Pues te tuve why perdí tu vuelo

Seras mi estigma de amor
Ya es orgullo saber que
Tu boca me perteneció
Ayer
",Estigma de Amor,2007
Kany García,"Hoy me cansé de mirarme al espejo
De colocarme más brillo en la cara
Por que ya a mis veinti cortos tú has hecho
Sentirme un tanto arrugada

Y si no voy con destellos
Sé que no llego a tu almohada
Si no mantengo firme mi cuerpo
Listo mi pelo, si no, no te tengo

Mujer de tacones, mujer que se inventa
Mujer que le teme llegar a cuarenta
Mujer que no entiende nada de experiencia
Mujer que denote poca inteligencia

Mujer que depende solo de apariencias
Si caigo en tu molde
Quizás yo me pierda
Maldigo tu existencia

Hoy decidí poner todo el deseo
Y desvestirme de frente a mi cama
Y me sorprende todo lo que veo
Porque soy más aún sin tener nada

Y descubrí que lo feo
Ya no se encuentra en la cara
Que hacerse bello no está en el cuerpo
Y que lo triste es que sigo viendo

Mujer de tacones, mujer que se inventa
Mujer que le teme llegar a cuarenta
Mujer que no entiende nada de experiencia
Mujer que denote poca inteligencia

Mujer que depende solo de apariencias
Si caigo en tu molde
Quizás yo me pierda
Maldigo tu existencia

Si demuestro quien soy
Entonces te vas, y te vas y te irás
Quédate con tu mundo de inseguridad
Un idiota con ropa
No veo nada contigo para escapar
Y solo si fuera

Mujer de tacones, mujer que se inventa
Mujer que le teme llegar a cuarenta
Mujer que no entiende nada de experiencia
Mujer que denote poca inteligencia

Mujer que depende solo de apariencias
Si caigo en tu molde
Quizás yo me pierda
Maldigo tu existencia

",Mujer de Tacones,2007
Kany García,"Ya no se por que
Nos dividen tantas cosas
Si yo solo quiero un nuevo amanecer
Solo se muy bien que te amo con la fuerza

Que atravieza mi conciencia why mi razon
Why esta vez para los dos
De aquel que crece en mi interior
Cruzare mares

Dejo aqui el corazon memorias de mil madrugadas
Sabiendo que, te vuelvo a ver
Cuando el tiempo lo decida
Cuando la suerte decida
Cuando logre sueño yo regresare

Te vuelvo a ver
Why en mi said guardo tu nombre
Why mi abrazo te responde que siempre estare
Why aun que hoy partire
En un nuevo sol te vuelvo a ver

Te escribire como va surguiendo todo
Un recuerdo tuyo se anida en mi piel
Why hoy soñare con tus manos en mi espalda
Con los brazos que me estiendes al caer

Dejo aki el corazon memorias de mil madrugadas
Sabiendo que, te vuelvo a ver
Cuando el tiempo lo decida
Cuando la suerte decida
Cuando logre sueño yo regresare

Te vuelvo a ver
Why en mi said guardo tu nombre
Why mi abrazo te responde que siempre estare
Que aun que hoy partire
En un nuevo sol te vuelvo a ver

Para sostenerme abrazado a las memorias
Pienso en el mañana donde vuelvo a estar con vos
En silencio cantare en un himno nuestra historia
Para que el llamado use un nuevo resplandor

Te vuelvo a ver
Why en mi said guardo tu nombre
Why mi abrazo te responde que siempre estare
Que aun que hoy partire
En un nuevo sol te vuelvo a ver

Kany García,"Como deseaba llenar mi mundo imperfecto
Lograste mostrar la manera de hacerlo pequeño
Ahora necesito espacio para darme más en el
Cuando llegas tú, todo basta

Desde muy pequeña tuve tanta fuerza
Difícil de controlarla en diferencias
Al borde de una locura entre gordura why ambición
En ese instante entras tú, todo basta

Todo basta cuando me entregas caricias nuevas
Todo es nada, todo sobra si no estás, si te vas
Si te escapas de ti, para hacerme feliz
Tan sólo faltas tú, todo basta

No he sido una fiel creyente de promesas
De esas que ven amores a lo eterno
Tampoco veía lo tierno como una gran virtud
Hasta que apreces tú, todo basta

Todo basta cuando me entregas caricias nuevas
Todo es nada, todo sobra si no estás, si te vas
Si te escapas de ti, para hacerme feliz
Tan sólo faltas tú

why todo, todo basta cuando me entregas caricias nuevas
Todo es nada, todo sobra si no estás, si te vas
Si te escapas de ti, para hacerme feliz
Tan sólo faltas tú, todo basta

Kany García,"Se puede intentar hacer canciones
El hombre ha hecho tanto por el arte
Se puede intentar romper paredes
Y luego hacer casas gigantes

Cansada me detengo y pienso
Si esto es lo que merecemos

Y debo decir adiós
Oh no no no

Sé que pude quedarme más tiempo

Y que aunque usara yo mi empeño

Kany García,"Ilusiones nuevas que van
Van bordando sueños enteros en telas de amores
Llegaste a mi paisaje árido y mis labios secos
Llegaste con mi amor construyendo un cuento

Tú eras la cueva y guarida de tantos recuerdos
Que te relegue
Y fuiste la imagen presente, cuando se me iba la mente
Yo viaja contigo
Tuve que despertar añorando pensar que estarías como siempre
Aquel 12 de noviembre
Y fui feliz aunque hoy no estés conmigo

Hoy me cuesta verte pasar
Como sino fuera evidente
Y si hay amor entre tú y yo porque no hay sacrificio
Por mirar quien cede más cayó en un precipicio

Deceando ser la vida de mi vida

Por fin no me he de preocupar
A quien le has de hablar
Cambiando mis historias

Las calles son más grandes desde que no estás
Camino sin el miedo de verme tropezar
Estoy con tanto gusto que no estés aquí
Sin ti yo hoy soy un poquito más feliz

Al verme decidir no regalarte mas mi tiempo y compañía
Yo se que algún día veras la soledad
Yo te di minutos de perdón
Sabiendo q tu error no era merecido

Las calles son más grandes desde que no estás
Camino sin el miedo de verme tropezar
Estoy con tanto gusto que no estés aquí
Sin ti yo hoy soy un poquito más feliz

Ingrato el tiempo aquel q yo pase contigo
Fue ingrato el tiempo, los segundos y momentos en que tu
Me hicistes mal

Las calles son más grandes desde que no estás
Camino sin el miedo de verme tropezar
Estoy con tanto gusto que no estés aquí
Sin ti yo hoy soy un poquito mas feliz

Y asi no se pregunten más
Porque ya no me ven con hombres tan apuestos
Toda mi vida lo intente
Pero al final todo era igual
Nunca encontraba lo que yo buscaba dentro
Reconoci que en los ojos no se llena el alma
Que nadie se le compara a quien hoy me acompaña
Él es el feo de la calle
Con su estilo funky
Es el feo de la calle
Con su estilo funky
Con su pelo tan desaliñado con su andar despreocupado 
Lo que nunca habia buscado él es el mismo que hoy anda conmigo
Asi esta mija, ninguno de ellos se busca andar conmigo
""Anda conmigo""
Digan lo que digan yo soy el elejido-
Quien pensaria que detras
De sus palabras iba a estar
Esa creación del cielo que hoy toma mi mano
Algunas le dijeron no por eso cuando dije si me ha sido fiel 
Y mucho mas que lo soñado yo se muy bien que este amor durará 
Para siempre creo que nunca yo fui tan feliz
Él es el feo de la calle
Con su estilo funky
Es el feo de la calle
Con su estilo funky
Con su pelo tan desaliñado con su andar despreocupado 
Lo que nunca habia buscado él es el mismo que hoy anda conmigo
Anda conmigo
Oye niña que probaste y me pelaste con el que nunca vaya de pelo lacio
Que lo nuestro es todo aca no en el gimnasio, y que la ceja no me saco
Que ando contigo porque tu quisiste estar conmigo esto no le 
Agrada ni a tus enemigos pararte en seco pocas hacen eso por 
Eso ná más te respeto, cuando uno cree se ve que no es como
Parece y lo que aprendiste son estupideses que los prejuicios
Son pá los que se fijan por eso soy el feo de la nena linda
El es el feo de la calle
Con su estilo funky
Ese soy yo tego calderon
Es el feo de la calle
Ven a bailarte
El es el feo de la calle
Con su estilo funky

Kany García,"Como había pensado fue pasando el día
Todo calculado sin haber sonrisas más que las medidas
Sin algún te quiero sólo indispensable
Allí te apareces tu
Cambiaste el mundo en medio día
Hoy no sé hasta donde ir
Pues nadie puede darnos esa guía

Hasta donde he de aguantar este silencio
Hasta cuando me voy a decir te quiero
Hasta donde he de callar
Dime cuanto debo sujetarme el alma
Hasta donde amor
Voy mostrando todo lo que
Llevo dentro

A veces te sueño y vuelo contigo a algún
Paraíso que tu y yo escogimos
A veces me miro y debo frenarme
Porqué me doy cuenta que mi alma arde
Como hace tanto no lo hacía
Que debo entregarme guardándome de a poco
Que ironía

Hasta donde he de aguantar este silencio
Hasta cuando me voy a decir te quiero
Hasta donde he de callar
Dime cuanto debo sujetarme el alma

Y aunque a veces doy la espalda
No es pensando en que te alejes
Es a ver si tu la abrazas

De esta despedida
Porque lo hice todo
Te entregue la vida

Volando de las manos
Se me fue escapando
Gracias a tu olvido

Y hoy
Hoy que no estas
Que no esperaba mas de ti
Ahora es que deseas hacerme feliz
Que tristeza da, ver que no miraste

Hoy con tus intentos
Van a mi memoria
Cual fotografía
Tanto que te dije
Lo que deseaba
Y sin ver repuestas yo aun así te amaba

Nunca pasa en vano
Y el cansancio
Se hizo mi mayor aliado

Que seas el hombre
Que una vez soñe
No, me vale ya

De que te perdone
Si el tiempo no vuelve

Que injusta se nos vuelve ya la vida
Que hubo cuando no es lo que creías
Cuando me diste una cara, era otra la que oía
Trillada se me escuchan las palabras
Es que a todos nos tocan algún día
De amar nadie se libra aunque así quiera
Tampoco de romperse el corazón

Como camino yo
No sé si alguien hoy pueda igualarme
Como e llorado yo
No se si en este día exista alguien
Alguien sin vida alguien
Hecho pedazos alguien
Alguien que amo
Qué vida la que vivo y que te marchas
A todos hablare de tu partida

Yo no quiero ni salir hasta las esquina
Solo de aquí me arreglo en 11 días
Espero que te vaya bien en todo
Es que aun con esta gran herida
Yo no tengo que guardarte un sentimiento
De esos que traen pena y agonía
Como camino yo
No sé si alguien hoy pueda igualarme
Como e llorado yo

Kany García,"Aquí sigo contando los segundos
Desde que me abrazó la soledad
Desde que te me fuiste sin maletas
Un viaje que es de ida y nada más

Vuelve
Que un beso nos quedó pendiente
Oh, vuelve
Que no estoy lista para perderte

Si estuvieras aquí, sería tan fácil vivir
Darías azules de gris, que nublan mi mundo
Si estuvieras aquí, ya no dolería seguir
Buscándole el sentido a cada paso de este rumbo
Si tú estuvieras aquí

De a ver sabido de ese último día
Te habría hecho desayuno y conversar
Con un te quiero el tiempo frenaría
Pero el destino se negó a esperar

Vuelve
Que un beso nos quedó pendiente
Oh, vuelve
Que no estoy lista para perderte

Si estuvieras aquí, sería tan fácil vivir
Darías azules de gris, que nublan mi mundo
Si estuvieras aquí, ya no dolería seguir
Buscándole el sentido a cada paso de este rumbo
Si tú estuvieras aquí
Aquí conmigo

No, no no, vuelve
Que recordar no es suficiente
Oh, uelve
Que no estoy listo para perderte

Si estuvieras aquí, sería tan fácil vivir

Kany García,"Cae al suelo, un sueño sin alas
Y nada puedo hacer yo
A pesar de todo lo que dimos
Aunque el miedo llegue
Sin invitación

Debo dar un salto al vacío
Por el bien de los dos
Y aunque las razones hoy me sobran
Nunca he sido buena
Pa' eso del adiós

¿Cómo decirle que ya no queda nada? No
¿Cómo explicarle lo que no tiene explicación?
Que se ha hecho tarde y ya la luz se me apagó
Si en una frase rompería su corazón
¿Cómo le digo que ya todo se acabó?

Quizás unas copas
De un buen vino tinto
Anestesien el dolor
Quizá si empaco todo y salgo huyendo
Pues nunca he sido buena
Pa' eso del adiós

¿Cómo decirle que ya no queda nada? No
¿Cómo explicarle lo que no tiene explicación?
Que se ha hecho tarde y ya la luz se me apagó
Si en una frase rompería su corazón
¿Cómo le digo que ya todo se acabó?

¿Cómo mantengo fuerte y firme la mirada?
¿Cómo pensar que ahora se acaba?
Luego de tanto, luego de tanto
Y ahora ¿cómo lograr soltarme el nudo en la garganta?
¿Cómo enfrentarlo? ¿Cómo le digo?
¿Cómo si nada?

¿Cómo decirle que ya no queda nada? No
¿Cómo explicarle lo que no tiene explicación?
Que se ha hecho tarde y ya la luz se me apagó
Si en una frase rompería su corazón
¿Cómo le digo que ya todo se acabó?

Que si me quito mis sandalias y ese día no me peino, murmuran

Me pongo mi camisa, más bonita
Combina con corbatita, pantalones y una linda sonrisita
Me tomo una fotito, pa' subirme la morada

Y soy libre, libre libre 
Así voy dejando mis culpas 
Y me vuelvo libre, libre libre 

Libre pa' soltarte, para no amarrarme 
Libre como pajarillos, vuelan en el aire 
Libre pa' desearte vida abundante 
Libre pa' dejarte, porque no eres mi otra parte

Dentro a mi casa y me pregunto 
Que como estoy yo, si ya no estas conmigo 
Y así me aferro a ese momento 
Y vivo con el sentimiento, que fue honesto conmigo 

Y llamo algún amigo y digo, quiero estar contigo 
Pa tomarme algún vinillo, para escuchar algún disquillo 
O me quedo tranquilo, pongo sabanas de hilo 
Y una peli que me haga suspirar 

Camino, soltando el pasado 
Y soy libre, libre libre 
Así voy dejando mis culpas 
Y me vuelvo libre, libre libre

No encuentro en los recuerdos 
Intento en ellos volver amarte 
No encuentro en los recuerdos 
Que hoy son pequeños 
Ya no me dan

A la otra orilla de tu almohada

What is you talking, man? That ain't important

We going crazy and I always use my best sense
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxin', relaxin, shootin' some pool and
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre

And parties at Richie is getting risky
Victoria's Secret show, they miss me
Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed
Ah, get out my fucking head
It's just me and my bad bitch
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us nigga
Cause I don't really trust niggas
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon' make it, that's on everything
Truest girls get half naked, every spring
They saying, ""Hey Kanye
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,""
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio, man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower.. that's what's up
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck

Feel the warmth we'll never die

You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh right away
At first sight I felt energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright tonight you and I

Or a gangsta...

Put my hand on the gas, drop my ass low
Slide on fast, then we go slow
Blaze up the endo, raise up the window
That's the way thugs, and gangstas roll

Baby take my advice, I'll lead you right
You need a thug in your life, that can hit it all night
I'll make sure we live laid, and keep the bills paid
You ain't gotta work, just be my personal maid
I don't want much but a bad bitch, that cook and clean
While I'm out in these streets, trying to look for green

Boss Hoggs hit the scene, we finally made it
Now some women strip, and some uneducated
But thanks to having cake, we done got our breaks
Affiliated with the streets, lifestyle ain't fake
Don't hate congratulate, while we demonstrate pimping
I ain't racist but I love to fuck, our black women
E.S.G. and I'm winning, yeah the Boss man's back
Turning heads while I spread, through your shit like anthrax
Sit that ass fat, call E and Slim them
Peanut butter Gucci brims, on them keep-spinning rims

I'm rolling, with a thug and a gangsta
That's the kind of niggas, that I like
Talking bout a hustla, that keep his mind on thangs
He don't care what them hatas say, keeping it gangsta everyday

Come get a ski-taste, we on a paper chase
For a Jada Pinkett face, with a J-Lo shape
Trying to bought a FED case, so I'm shaking and moving
Got partnas that don't rap, what you think that they doing
Now money we pursuing, SES be shining
Slim go ahead, and I done swallowed a dime

Come ride with a thug now, you could let your guards down
Be yourself, you ain't gotta act when I'm around
See I ain't the jealous type, that like to bust and fight
Live your life, sweetheart you not my wife
I'm far from a gentleman, you feel what I'm saying
I'm a hard working hard man, nigga with plans
Understand I get around, and can't be held down
Fuck what I did last night, let's have fun now
I want a brown dime piece, that can roll a sweet
That's a lady in the streets, but a freak in the sheets

Put my hand on the gas, drop my ass low
Slide on fast, then we go slow
Blaze up the endo, raise up the window
That's the way thugs, and gangstas roll

Who say hood rats ain't fine, they done lost they mind
On a scale of one to ten, I done seen plenty nines

I like em high class with ass, Gucci down to the ground
When she pass, she make the whole crowd turn around

Real deal Cedric Hill, trying to make a mill
Give a woman ecstasy, without taking a pill

I want a gal caramel, that smell like Shanel
The kind of female, you put in your V-12

Yellow bones race up, but I reverse on dark

And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
So I had to did, what I had to did
Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Until the blue and white (po po! po po! po po!)
Now the money coming slow, but a least a nigga know
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)

[Verse - Common]
You love to hear the story, again and again
About these young brothers, from the City of Wind
Like juice and gin, in the city we blend
Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims
Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed
Heartless females that wanna ride in em
Felt the southside venom in raw hides and denim
Pimp minds collide wit em, a system that tries victims
We living in, my man in the fast lane pivoting
On the block white is selling like Eminem
On the block it ""Jump Off"" like Kim and them
On the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then
Shorties get the game but no instructions to assembling
Eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dimming them
Call my man cuzo, like I'm kin to him
He trying to stay straight, the streets is bending him

Whether on ball courts, attires of all sorts
We never fall short, wit us it's our Force like And 1's
Some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for
Cats is colder than four below, wit self I go toe to toe
Wondering if it's for the art or for the doe
Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go
Though I know the doe I got to bring back to the ghetto
Arrows on Terot cards pointing to the grind
Po' livin in more prisons, pointing to my mind, shine the light up
Clench my fists tight, holding the right up
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
Situations, and jobs get tighter
My man trying to get his weight and height up, c'mon!

I - I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my gun away

No no not tonight
See I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me

I break bread wit thieves and pastors, OG's and masters
Emcees and actors that seize and capture

It can feed a man's daughter

Kanye West,"Welcome to the bank
Where you deposit Young Money, and you get Cash Money
I'm Tunechi, the Boss
And live from the vault, is Busta Bust

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Swag mania, pop that goes most
Carry the most beautiful bitches
With us, happily toast
Keep the faculty close
Gross want me, give them a dose
Got them ODing, leaning in each coast
Scenery froze, take notes, Rock Rolls
Diamonds that fit in Chanel Minks in the winter
Who fucking with us?
We coming to give them the shivers, watery flows, spilling like rivers
Flooding the street, hoping niggas' swimming is moving gorillas
King Kongs, Godzillas when we roll up
Seat filling niggas, get up when we show up

Uh, shit
Please don't throw up
Hold your liquor, grow up
If you robbing niggas, we going to show you how to blow up
Thank your lucky stars, it's the Rap Czar, tuck your shit in
My niggas bite like Rin Tin Tin, my chagrin
You never win, model thin, walking crack in your shin
She gives in every time that I spin
Square up, bow down to the kings of the hall
We wade on, talk shit while we ball
So what's cracking with yall?

Made in New York, and the slick talking thieves of the order [?]
Call the reporter, stepping like the British walkers
Legendary swag flu and see the influence, see how we do it
Get them into it steadily. God, I'm stupid, so undisputed
Act fool, back tool, until they pop off
Police crowd up the street, blocking them off, locking them off
Got these niggas wilding while I signal my soldiers
Posting it up, maintaining composure, staying on the sofa
Thirty bottles, twenty waitresses, bring them over
See how we light up shit, nigga, call the promoter
And tell that nigga bring the bag, better hurry up with it
And count the money up proper, cause you can get it

Yeah
It feel good, don't it?
It feel good, don't it?
Hey, I want to let yall know
Hey, hey
I want to let yall know
This Yeezy
And you listening to Q-Tip

Set them up, stiletto up, saddle up and let's go
Good times, only difference, niggas making your dough
Chatter is up, peep the way we batter it up
On top of the mountain, folding the ladder up
You dead and done rip up your paper, cause your status is none
Transfixed on the strengths of the page, whether chopper or gauge [?]
You're just a single, cause you wouldn't engage
Turnt up with the script on the cup, you keep the goggles[?] with us

See how we push sometimes man forget cuff, beat him the head
Boop-be-de-de-boff, zippity-boof
Beat him in the head again, ""stop killing me, Wolf!""
Whop!
Beat a nigga till he drop, piggity-poof!
Oxy in me pulse
He don't want no problem with niggas
Fuck it, let's get to drinking, poison our livers
Dammit, we sinners when me and Abstract are together, see we deliver
She got me touching it, fucking on all my fingers, dammit we winners
Pillaging this rap shit, homie, they know
Kill everything until it's time for me to go
That's when I bomb it with a blow
And then I black and get a little bit dummy
The microphone is bleeding, you should take it from me!

Incredibly we do it, and it resonates the music
I tune it, YouTube it, it could never ever be refuted
It's gnarly for niggas and naughty for ninas
Bitches and ballerinas
Ballers and in-betweeners
Blatant non-believers and over-achievers
Kicking it in paisley[?] Adidas
Drink Aliz in liters
All of you must reconcile a leader
She's begging to eat us, and her man's attitude defeated
But never a scandal, because me and Busta came to handle, we gentlemen

Not to mention, we're veterans
Second, he need some medicine
Before I black[?] as he get off my premises
Better fly, you pelican, idiot ass niggas
But then again, you need a suit for your funeral measurements
See me doing it effortless?
It's never getting no better than this
Giving your shit to convince a better preference
Watch me turn them to skeletons
See how I come and bring out the betterness?
Time is with it and I rep the foreverness
Flying, United Emirates - sized private plane, that kind of etiquette
Purchasing diamonds, handle them delicate
Now you need you a better ref
You could peep us regulating, see we all in this bitch like we ain't never left",Thank You,
Kanye West,"I used to dream, I used to dream, oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls and the girls
But now I sing, now I sing, oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world, the whole world

And now I sing, sing, sing, sing
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I sing, sing, sing, sing
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

Man, I remember before I say that wait, let me issue this statement
No way should reflection be mistaking for glorification
Now I remember so vivid me and my niggas was living
Sub standard condition still handling business

Still laughing and tripping, still having the bitches
I'm rapping now reminiscing and goddammit we did it
From trapping standing and pitching with rich we stand in the kitchen
Splitting it eight ways flipping it 8 days

Thought that wild and unruly was just the way to behave
Kept the weight and the yey for most the paper
We made in all dimes, I ain't lying, the pleasure was all mine
Have big work to move but we served the small time

I always out shined the niggas with small minds
Who would of thought we would be arguably the greatest of all time
Around here we developed such a sound down here
But duplicate it off the steel it can only be found here

Only listen to G's that other shit I don't hear
Shit they so far in the rear how would I even care
I'm too busy being a player staring at nigga's careers
But talk about it for years and now we finally here

I used to dream, I used to dream, oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls and the girls
But now I sing, now I sing, oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world, the whole world

And now I sing, sing, sing, sing
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I sing, sing, sing, sing
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

They say what goes up must come down
But I ain't reached my cruising altitude
Take a look at what I did but can you imagine what I'm about to do
The places I'm 'bout to go and the money I'm bout to see
Gave Bill Gates some binoculars and said, look out for me

Exceeded expectations even at def jam
'Cause I married the streets and Atlanta has been my best man
My momma quit her job and now she works for six figures
'Cause I'm a self made nappy headed rich nigga

Private planes help me travel in peace
To four cities in one day and four countries in one week
'Cause I work for myself and no one else cause I'm too smart too
Put one of my partners right through culinary art school

Now he my personal chef so that bread he get it
Put 'em all in houses cleaned up all of my friends credit
And now they witness all the glitz and the glamor
Catch us eating at straits Atlanta with women with table manners

Order in Singapore and lobster
Celebrating coming from nothing to winning Grammy's
And rappers winning Oscars
And they say rappers shouldn't act, nah suckers
We see Samuel Jackson like what's up motherfucker

I used to dream, I used to dream, oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls and the girls
But now I sing, now I sing, oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world, the whole world

And now I sing, sing, sing, sing
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I sing, sing, sing, sing
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

I know them haters don't stop plotting and wish you would fall
'Cause I'm standing on top looking down at it all
Know from down there to ya'll it seem like I got it all
Homie I ain't get enough, I'm still trying to triple up

So all we got is street cred and akoo building up
Say I'm doing too much shit, I say I ain't did enough
Remember saying damn if I could just get to a million plus
And now I'm like shit what the fuck is a million bucks

Triple that on my bond thanks to Bigs and Ron
But never mind what I've been through, just look at what I become
All the shit I've avoided, what I done for my sons
And daughters and momma just call her

I sold dope and dropped out of school seems its all they can see
They don't notice none of my family did that since me
I broke that cycle now my family live a life of
Mandatory minimals but not when the judge sentence them

Cousins in college where you think they get tuition from
Just from standing around wishing, huh
And while you standing around looking dumb
I make it happen taking action over time got damn good at it

I used to dream, I used to dream, oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls and the girls
But now I sing, now I sing, oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world, the whole world

And now I sing, sing, sing, sing
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I sing, sing, sing, sing
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
 
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
 
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
 
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
 
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice, don't think twice)
 
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
 
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts

So you believe me, baby?
Yeah, for sure I do

He managed to leave without getting his feelings hurt

But dude a lame
He probably asked you can he work it out?

I swear, y'all, betta keep the game on 'em
Yeah, y'all, now watch me change on 'em
Rule one: never tell your nigga who you fucked
And always smile back if he tell you he in love
Rule two: most men try to control you
Take my advice, 'cause it's so true what women go through
And rule three: you thinkin' he don't cheat and he committed?
He still get invitations from the last girl he been with
Bet his ho be mad; I bet she tell you that he hit it
Just check inside his pocket; find another bitches digits

Yeah
Point out the bounce, yeah, Young Hov' the king nigga

I got why'all

For those that think Hov' fingers bling bling'n
Either haven't heard the album or they don't know English
They only know what the single is, and singled that out
To be the meaning of what he is about
And being I'm about my business, not mingling much
Running my mouth, that shit kept lingering
But no dummy, that's the shit I'm sprinkling
The album width to keep the registers ringing
In real life, I'm much more distinguished
I'm like a bloke from London, England
Yeah, you jingling baby
See I go right back and I bring 'em in baby
Business mind of a Ross Perot, but never lost my soul
Crossed the line, I bought pop across the row
Then I walk through the hood, where they up to no good
Slanging them O's like a real O.G. should
Oh, he's good, no he would never sell out he's so young

Point out the bounce, and show you how to get this dough in

Point out the bounce, I turn a 8 to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R.O.C.
Point out the bounce, Timbo the king nigga
Yeah
Point out the bounce, yeah, Young Hov' the king nigga

Magazines call me a rock star, girls call me cock star
Billboard, pop star, neighborhood block star
Chi-Town go-getting pimps, we mobsters
Gingerbread Man even said, ""You're a monster!""
Yeah, that's how I feel
To be down, you must appeal
To the crew, we're rated are
O.C., O.G., Bobby Johnson son
Ask me, ""Rey-Rey, is that yo' car?""
I seen MTV, I know who you are
You did ""Takeover,"" do you got beef with Nas?
I did take over the game, brought back the soul
Got tracks to go, got plaques that's gold
Platinum to go, yeah that's the flow

Yeah, turn me up yeah

What if somebody from the Chi was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God drive two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe; safe
My dogs couldn't tell if I
I look Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky, it was televised
It's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys are Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Know what I'm saying
When the doctor told me I had a um, I was goin to have a plate on my chin
I said dog don't you think didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on

Something that you will regret
I'm on your team
It's us against them you'll see
Hey, we ain't gon stop

The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about
Instead they just running they mouth
So all we do is tune them out

Spreadin what they heard
I cant give them no run
I can't be concerned with all that talk
I won't be involved
That's my word
See I'm not the one
They got me confused

How you listen to a girl who still wanna man
Tell me the truth is that a man or Juwanna Man
I'm wondering why she red to go like Wanda Van
When we met you was a V like manana man
Now you went field running plays like Donovan
Knick nav before you get in a cab
I trade in my cab
Just to take you back to last summer man
You don't remember when you was my sweetest
You don't remember I called you Reece's Pieces
'Cause it's no wrong way to do you know what
She turned around giggle said you so nuts
But nowadays we acting way too grown up
But how ya ex girl get that new number
The rumors was so numerous
For sticking by me I had to give you two thumbs up
And that's why

The more they talk about our love

But I got to get this off my chest about all the shit I've been hearing babe I
I thought you were that ride or die
You will never leave my side
I even made you out to be the woman that I will be with for life 
I took in your kids did everything that you wanted me too
Heard about frontin' on radio and the fuse
Don't make me feel good to lie, even though you make me wanna cry
Hey, if you gonna tell anything, then you should have told everything
Instead of making me the bad guy
If you got nothing good to say then don't say nothing

Yes, I'll accept it, what's up?

Sittin' in my cell, heard about the burst
Wouldn't be alive, if I didn't bust first
Had it made, sorry for the ricochet
But I'd be in the grave if I didn't let it spray

Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way

But to give you part two of my confessions (if you got something to confess too right now, step to the mic, Twista)

I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus coupe
Ya homie said she saw me but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've just been tellin' you the truth
And I confess about the days I was rollin' my Seville with the custom gold grill
I was in the field still lookin' for a thrill
And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real
And I confess that, just when I thought I could really try to get away
While having other women on the side
But I never knew that it would catch up wit' a nigga one day
You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson'
If you stay with me then it'll be a blessin', no stressing
It'll never be no guessin'
'Cause I pulled one out my heart and these are my confessions

Man, how did she bring it up? How did she break it down?
Man, you at the clinic? Dog, slow down that's your child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin'
And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she gon' tell you to beat it
You know it ain't y'all little secret, you famous you can't go nowhere
Cause everytime you go there, it's hoes there
So basically you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her ""Man, don't say that""
Matter fact like Pat don't say jack
Everytime a nigga sittin' on pay stacks
Things come up from way, way, way back

Way back, way back, way way back

Custom seats are amazin' tellin' nobody could touch that bitch
Shoes my Maurie, piss by the month, he cut shock shit
Anything from my hoes when I ask, I get it
In the Cadillac I kick it, since y'all I wanted to be like macks and Bishop

Flossin' my club, peepin' persons yellin' out ""Chuuuch!""

You can't change pimpin', from the Stone Age to the ""Space Age"" pimpin'
From Southern mackin' in Memphis to the playa mo' when you shoot to Chi

I told her to drive over in yo new whip, bring some friends you cool wit
I'ma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbing me, calling me Biggie like Shyne home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lying though?
Telling me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played 'ready for the world', she was ready for some action
My dog said you ain't no freak , so you bout to prove my man wrong
I'ma lay this Vandross, you gon take yo pants off
I'ma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon get right

But now I need you to do it faster baby, can you please - do it faster, do it
Faster
Damn baby, I can't do it that fast but I know somebody who can, Twista!

When I catch you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
While I'm laying back smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you when I'm messing wit Kan man and Twist in the Chi
And I be sipping hennessey, play some R&B
While I smoke a b - you can preferably find that I'm a G
And all this (well well well well)
Come wit me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light,  move it to some Isaac
His rims still moving so I bump a lil Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b - dipping through the streets
Bumping r&b, and I got the leaf, on the 23's
And I do it (well well well well)
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze
Fulfilling her wit every temptation, slow jam, and havin deep sex
You ready for the world girl, baby come on go wit me
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment controlling me
I love the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass, you be bumping Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's r&b, come to the club wit me
And when some Luther come on I hope you feeling me
And still will be in love wit me

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

Kitchen orders that I'm cooking
But got caught up with the jooks you woulda thought I was from Brooklyn
It gets boring just looking
Did like Bill Cosby, pouring in the pudding
Now the dashboard is wooden from a hard-tangled grammar

Car game bananas

Guns everywhere, like the car came with hammers

Cop me Air Ones, hon, lime and red
You got pets? Me too: mine are dead
Fox, minks, gators that's necessary
Accessories, my closet's a ""Pet Sematary""
I get approached by animal activists
I live in a zoo
I run scandals with savages
All my niggas get together to gather loot
Bodyguard for what? Dog, I'd rather shoot
I go to war, old Timbs, battered boots
Hand grenade, goggles and a parachute
Ya'll don't even know the name of my flip

Pony skin Louis? Oh, you fly too
You a stewardess? Good ma, I fly too""

Harlem Shake? Nah, I'm in Harlem shaking awake
Shaking to bake, shaking the Jakes

When we met you was a V like manana man
Now you went field runnin' plays like Donovan
Knick nav before you get in a cab
I trade in my cab
Just to take you back to last summer man
You don't remember when you was my sweetest
You don't remember I called you Reeses Pieces
Cause it's no wrong way to do you know what
She turned around giggle said you so nuts
But nowadays we actin' way too grown up
But how ya ex girl get that new numba
The rumors was so numerous
For sticking by me I had to give you two thumbs up

While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga
Give me some head, that'll really piss him off

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya d's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!""

I blow past low class niggas with no cash
In the fo' dash six, bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash

Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon
Pullin' up in the Lexus's one on both hand
So I guess them GS's was ambidextrous

Could of sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages
""K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam""

So say my name like Candyman
And I'm a come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya d's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!""

Kanye West,"This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be life
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why had guard have to look all to it?
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business

And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for
Now all I know I know all these things

This is family business
And this is for everybody standin' with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like ""See, that's my cousin on TV""
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't want to be rude
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food
And you don't want to stay there 'cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed

Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say

I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without usin' nines and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?
The second she storms out then he storms in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business

Yo Kwe', she don't believe me, please pickup the line

You'se a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead
I'm here to resurrect me, mug is to sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
To many featured emcees, and producers is popular

The years clear your image and looped up
Label got you suped up, telling you you sick

Even your club record need a booster
Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga
Read the infa', red across your head I'm bread king like Simba
Bolder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a emcee with a temper

Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here

Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars

So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the ""Truth"" beat for Beanie. 
And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. 
I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin?"" I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay.""
Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with

So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you

And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. 
And No ID told him, ""Look man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""

No ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""


I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

[Hiphop: ""I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper""]

I'm like oh shit. I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time.And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't be Life.""

And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude.""

[Jay-Z: ""Oh you a real soulful dude, man""]

And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said

[Jay-Z: ""Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here""]

""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""

[Jay-Z: ""so what you think of this?""]

And I was like, ""Man that shit tight,"" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...

[Mother: ""Come on, let's just go""]

Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up

[Mother: ""Kanye, baby, we're here""]

I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat
To DMX

[Hiphop: ""No I think Jay gon' like this one right here""]

And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what's up I'm Kanye.""

[Dame: ""Yo, you that kid, Kanye?""]

""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics""

[Dame: ""Jay got classics, G.""]

You know I ain't talkin shit. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said ""man that was tight.""

[Jay-Z: ""That, that was cool. That was hot.""]

That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say ""naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...

[Jessica: ""Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.""]

I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up

[""Y'all niggas is stupid""]

Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad

[Joe: ""We gonna change the game, buddy.""]

Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.""

[Dame: ""You gotta make sure it's not wack.""]

Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'

I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got eleven plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.""
Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. 
So I play that song for him and he's like ""oh shit""

[Dame: ""Oh shit it's not even wack.""]

""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.""

[Dame: ""it's actually kinda hot.""]

Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick""

[Dame: ""you don't wanna catch a brick""]

""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on."" I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer rapper,"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal""

[Mel: ""Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.""]

And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?""

Kanye West,"Hey Jimmy where you going?

I don't know where I'm going.
My Dad died, and he left me his degrees.
My mom would always say ""Dad, why don't you work?"",
But he just kept learning.
All the other kids parents were working and saving up money for school,
And I was actually in school all when my dad was in school.
He was so greedy with degrees, he took my degree.
And now I'm just glad he left me these.
Because all the regular homeless people have newspaper, and look what I have.
These are documented.
My father left them for me.
And I'm going to leave them to my kids.
I'm going to learn too.
I'm going to get super smart, so I to can die without money.
But I'll be the smartest dead guy.
Who has that",Lil Jimmy Skit,2004
Kanye West,"When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

Yo, first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have their heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the rovers roll up wit ribbons
I seen them repo'd, resold then redriven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzlin'
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'm a be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God given
This is hard livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy

Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggaz can't make it to ballads to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racisms still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even make me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized each 3 or 4 times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
Its goin' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father past away
So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watchin' me from the other side

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you're apart of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm tryin' to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why it's spiritual
But I get my hymns from him
So it's not me it's he that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm tryin' to give us us free like Sinke
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the death
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of god reigns out

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get down

Who else you know been hot this long
Started from nothing but he got this strong
Built the ROC from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Peddled bikes, got my nephews peddle bikes because they special
Let you tell it man I'm fallin' well
Somebody must have caught him 'cause
Every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em
Number one albums what I got, like four of 'em
More of them on the way, the 8th wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissin' Jay will get you Mase'd
When I start spittin' them lyrics niggas get very religious
Six hail Mary's please Father forgive us
Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas

Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught

Can they huh?
I spit it through the wire man
Too much stuff on my heart right now man
I'll probably risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kanye to the,
Chi-Town what's going on man

I drink a Boost for breakfast, and Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizzerk
Not to worry the Mr. H says that the izzles back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her life support
When you telling her your son's on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emitt Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing that Dynasty sign
I'm use to trying to reline
I been trying to signed
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here is history in the making man

I really apologize how I sound right now man
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstru'
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
Looked in the mirror half my jaw was missing and half my mouth, ya kno
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now yo
This is what I gotta say yo
Yeah, turn me up yeah

What if somebody from the shadow was I'll got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God drive two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe; safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I look Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky, it was televised
It's been an accident like Geico
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys are Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Know what I'm saying
When the doctor told me I had a um, I was goin to have a plate on my chin

We say the facts and if, they lie
We comin' back for them
They might say, but they don't know!
(they say, they say)
They don't know

They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be telling derick, ""tell kara get us a show""
Little com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man ain't necessarily the nigga wit dough
They say ""you ripped"" ""wow"" yea, that's what they say
My niggas couldn't tell it was me, like jamie in ray
Painting a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say ""dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes""
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye

Go head and breath it in like antihistamine

Fuck you expect? I've got a history
Groupie love now, gotta be them wheels!
Haters back down, gotta be that steel!
I know they cant wait till ya outta ya deal!
Look how they did d'angelo ask em how do it feel!
My best friends worry bout me
'Cause they know when you famous/fame-ass
And you had made cash the media aims at us and you be up so high
If you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash
But god don't ever give me nothing I cant handle
So please don't ever give me records I cant sample
So I could vacate where it ain't no channels
But it's quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess it's messing with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
I'm just going check myself in, again

They say ""dude think he righteous""
I write just to free minds, from stoney to rikers
Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as mike is
On my paper, whether its weed or isis
They say ""life is a game,"" so I play hard
Writing for my life cause I'm scared of a day job
They say ""sef kept the hood together""
I tell the young, ""we can't play the hood forever""
Play my cards right, they say I went to left
They showed me strange love, like I was mr. f
Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights
Now I claim ""king"" like don, or frank white
They say my life is comparable to christ's
The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice
They say ""the crochet pants and the sweater was wack""
Seen ""the corner"", now they say ""that nigga's back,"" uh

Kanye West,"Memories on corners with the fours & the moors [pronounced foes and moes]
Walk to the store for the rose talking straightforward to
Got uncles that smoke it some put blow up they nose
To cope with they lows the wind is cold & it blows
In they socks & they souls holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened & closed hoping for more
With nowhere to go rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way cause they ain't knowing they goal
The streets ain't safe cause they ain't knowing he code
By the fours I was told either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes & roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a ""Olds"" with windows that don't roll
Down the roads where cars get broke in & stole
These are the stories told by Stony & Cottage Grove
The world is cold the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

I wish I could give ya this feeling
I wish I could give ya this feeling
On the corners, niggas robbing, killing, dying
Just to make a living (huh)

We underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when times stood still
And gators and snakes gangs and yellow and pink
And colored blue profiles glorifying that

Streetlights & deepnights cats trying to eat right
Riding no seat bikes with work to feed hypes
So they can keep sweet Nikes they head & they feet right
Desires of streetlife cars & weed types
It's hard to breath nights days are thief like
The beast roam the streets the police is Greeklike
Game at it's peak we speak & believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
Its steep life coming up where sheeplike
Rappers & hoopers we strive to be like
G's with 3 stripes seeds that need light
Cheese & weaves tight needs & thieves strike
The corner where struggle & greed fight
We write songs about wrong cause it's hard to see right
Look to the sky hoping it will bleed light
Reality's and I heard that she bites
The corner

The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dancers and
War cries that broke out on different corners
Power to the people, black power, black is beautiful

Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burger its
Cats with gold permanents move they bags as herbalist
The dirt isn't just fertile its people working & earning this
The curb-getters go where the cash flow & the current is
It's so hot that burn to live the furnace is
Where the money move & the determined live
We talk play lotto & buy german beers
It's so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument,
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace and to love
Down on the corner",Corners [Back II Basics Remix],2005
Kanye West,"Ayyo, good morning, America, good morning to Erica
Who gave me good head while watching 'Good Morning America'
And good day, New York, have a good day in court
My niggaz drive around the hood looking for good yay' to snort

I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy, look alive, look alive, look or try
You know that old saying what they say about good guys

I guess that's why I went bad, needed all my chicks bad
Fiends needed it bad, started hittin' liq' bad
Had to get that work off before that shit went bad
If not, it gets bad and things will only get bad

So now I'm getting bad skin and I got that badge and
Tellin' me them bastards, don't catch a bad break
Caught a bad rate on whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways havin' a bad day

So now the game's ugly and my pain's ugly
And my chain's ugly, things became ugly [Incomprehensible]
Got a stain and its musty, wakin' up looking crusty
And miss thang who's ugly is sayin' to me, ""Don't touch me""

I went from pretty Willie to pretty silly
But I'm still pretty gully so you thin's will still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly

We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon' love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny

We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
Niggaz give pounds and hug me, know they really wanna slug me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me

Good morning to ummm, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my niggaz ride down
And bust clowns and look for some bust downs to bust down

Yeah, she ain't got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin', she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone 'cuz she was bad to the bone
She from a batter home, she mad when she at home

So I gave her my number to beep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin' scary movie nuts, I had to get the freak off
The new Tom Cruise, took the Moulin Rouge on a too long cruise
She said, ""I ain't bonin' you with them two long shoes""

And I get bougie in a grape poupon mood
So I'ma act cheap in a coupon mood
She said, ""Ye' you don't love me?""
I told her that's the good, the bad, the ugly

We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said, get ya money ain't no telling they gon' love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me

Ayyo, good morning to Queens, the North side of my scene
And when it comes down to it, I'm a ride for my team
See it's a beautiful life but the bills will make it ugly
And the beauty of life is when you're forced to make it ugly

Had a beautiful night 'til a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcing and it's ugly
Now my mind state is ugly, my blind dates are ugly
And I'm ready to turn it up in these streets and make it ugly

Used to sit in Mr. Uglies with these sisters that was ugly
And these bitches used to bug me to the point it made me ugly
And say things that was ugly and lead a ball abruptly
But I took it all back 'cuz God don't like ugly

Now I'm curbin' my bad words, they say that the bad burn
I left it on bad terms with a chic with a bad perm
Whose case took a bad turn and face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said, she had bad germs

The bad thing about it, the bitch was bad and 'bout it
But the pussy smelled bad so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad blood, her son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood

And once it get bad, it be bad for good
That's bad meaning bad, not bad meaning good
But I greet it as good when you leave with the good
It's all good in the hood, got called good 'cuz it's good

Now I'm havin' some good nights, livin' this good life
Got me a good girl that I'm gon' make me a good wife
So I'm good to go and I'm good where I go
Come on, man got good aim and that's a good thing to know

And he came home for good, off of good behavior
Spittin' that good game so what's good with this paper?
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly

Ayyo, we showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon' love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny

We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
Niggaz give pounds and hug me, know they really wanna slug me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me

Hoes from on TV so it's All-Star trains
Just picture man, no snitchin' man
Somethin' for the fiends fresh out the kitchen man
Last 9.11 I was poor on the ave
'Til I pulled out my map
Not it's course 9.11 and I'm floorin' the gas
Gotta lotta problems, but at least one that Annette have no more
Uh, well Dame look at how everybody changed
Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game
Tell B.I.G. that we about to get paid
All my niggas about to have it made

Goddamn Kanye (Kanye) Kanye!

Ain't nobody messin' with me dog
Now you say it (ain't nobody messin' with you at all)
I told dude ""You can't even rap on my interlude""
Now does that make me as rude as you?
(When the album comin' out?) Man the peoples is askin'
Why'all don't model Adidas, just stick with the fashion
Why'all already got do' so just spit for the passion
The way ya rhyme give me Tribe Called Quest flashbacks

I used to work at the mall with nothin' at all
Seein' niggas that ball, that shit was depressin'
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I hate with the pressin'
When I copied hounds it was my best investment
Dre got shot and it taught me a lesson
I'm stickin' niggas up and them rubbery masses
Mash like Batman minus the tight pants
Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy
Fo' different blues, man your outfit is crashin'
You ain't got no muscles dude you weakling bastard
Man look at your haircut

Yo, first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have their heart

I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the rovers roll up wit ribbons
I seen them repo'd, resold then redriven
So when I reload, he holds number one position

They even make me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized each 3 or 4 times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
Its goin' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father past away
So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watchin' me from the other side

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you're apart of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm tryin' to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why it's spiritual
But I get my hymns from him
So it's not me it's he that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm tryin' to give us us free like Sinke
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the death
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of god reigns out

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get down

Who else you know been hot this long
Started from nothing but he got this strong
Built the ROC from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Peddled bikes, got my nephews peddle bikes because they special
Let you tell it man I'm fallin' well
Somebody must have caught him 'cause
Every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em
Number one albums what I got, like four of 'em
More of them on the way, the 8th wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissin' Jay will get you Mase'd
When I start spittin' them lyrics niggas get very religious
Six hail Mary's please Father forgive us
Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
They way y'all all follow Jigga

Everybody want to be Hov and Hov's still alive",Never Let Me Down [*],2005

Kanye West,"For all my niggaz, that drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya money till it gets sky high
Do me a favor kids sing, kids sing
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky
And say we don't care what people say

If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin' so cold
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dope man
Only a dope man, I knew that wasn't a coke man
Flickin' starter coats man, man, you know man
We don't care what people say

This is for my niggaz outside all winter
'Cuz this summer they ain't finna to say next summer, I'm finna
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no to tuition for havin' no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
We forced to sell crack rap and get a job
You gotta do somethin' man your ass is grown

Say, drug dealin' just to get by
Sing, stack ya money till it gets sky high
Do me a favor kids sing, kids sing
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky
And say we don't care what people say

The second verse is for my dogs workin' 9 to 5
That still hustle, a nigga can't shine off 6.55
And everybody sellin' make-up, Jacobs
And bootleg tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money cop work than push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say

My momma say she wanna move south
Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
Around the same time, Doe ran up in dudes house, couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game polemic, it's hard to get weight
Niggaz money is homo, it's hard to get straight
We gon' keep bakin' to the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say

My niggaz, drug dealin' just to get by
Sing, stack ya money till it gets sky high
Do me a favor kids sing, kids sing
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
But the jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky
And say we don't care what people say

That I can go on without you baby

Yeah, history in the makin, do or die
Yeah, yeah, uh, uh, uh
Me and do or die got maneuvers
Cold pimp tactics all in one package
Hollerin' at a chick that could of been a actress
Right now her back is layin' on my mattress
Why your team pissed like urine
Only rock things made for a king
Tell me tell me it was the lv
Bigger that the jeans of the
Rap floor green
That's how I gotcha
So I you want a role model to call like patra
Quit hollerin' at them losers
And get with this shit that
Got his own business an entrepreneur

Off the block now
Shit got the pipe down
Industry niggas I just got bomb
Track from kanye west pass the bomb aye
Kick the doors down like desert storm
Where's the millions
I'm the chameleon
Transformatin', rock a show like god
Drivin' for status
Big my apparatus
You gotta now I'm getting all that dough
Hotter than your shit
Bullshit, got a full clip
Think I'm a punk then get your back broke slow
I'm the shiznick down to my diznick
Lyrics so hot enough for frozen snow
Feel of the bomb again and get fucked the he say she say
He say she say I ain't gon make it

From the days of Capone, nigga
You know we gon take it

Save some room for the black casanova

With a hummer h2 with the benz there's no frontin'
With some ice you can skate on
Now I got no weight on
It's gettin to the point when the ballas try hate on
Proticops I stayed on
And made a lot of hot songs
Do you think I'm a P.I.M.P
In a sl5 halle berry colors scoop me
Groupies and gucci you know you can't exclude me
Ladies get around be like ""he's so cool g""
No I'm not booshie just eric and young stoopie
The black hugh heffner

Tell me tell me lord can you hear me?
Sometimes I walk these streets and get weary
Most of the times I can't let these niggas get near me
With this hatred, jealousy, and envy
I went to church and they said you had a remedy
A remedy to set me free and take away my enemies
So I pray to the day when I get to see
All the faces that put me down up in the industry
So from the street to the club
It's ya boy show me love
We gotta keep it gangstas that's how we gettin love
Never fall for the love of the dough

Kanye West,"Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
Have no fear that they might
Desert me

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, 'cause
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does
He write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Its for yourself that's important
If a stripper named Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink
I'm supposed to stop I can't because

I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more can you ask for?
The international assholes nah
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is why'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic

You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like ""pssh we messed up""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man, are why'all OK man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
Are, are, are, right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

Huh! Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?

I know He hear me when my feet get weary
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers are role models we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, video tape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played
Huh?
Well let this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out

Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore three years aint picked a career
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well

Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down

Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe

Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down

I say fuck the police, that's how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shortys hollering ""where the ballas' at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even goin' act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it

So now I'm getting bad skin, and I got that badge and
Tellin me them bastards, don't catch a bad break
Caught a bad rate on whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways havin a bad day
So now the game's ugly, and my pain's ugly
And my chain's ugly, things became ugly, 'cause I'm ugly ducklin'

And when it comes down to it, I'm a ride for my team
See it's a beautiful life, but the bills will make it ugly
And the beauty of life, is when you're forced to make it ugly
Had a beautiful night, until a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcing and its ugly
Now my mind state is ugly, my blind dates are ugly
I'm ready to turn it up in the streets and make it ugly
Used to sit in Mr. Uglies with these chickens that were ugly
And these bitches used to bug me to the point it made me ugly
Say things that were ugly in regards to their tummies
But I took it all back, 'cause God don't like ugly
Now I'm curbin' my bad words, they say that the bad burn
I left it on bad terms, with a chic with a bad perm
Whose case took a bad turn, and face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said she had bad germs
The bad thing about it, the bitch was bad and bout it
But the pussy smelled bad, so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad blood, her son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood
And once it get bad, it be bad for good
That's bad meaning bad not bad meaning good
But I greet it as good, when you leave with the good
Its all good in the hood, got called good 'cause I'm good
Now I'm havin' some good nights, livin' this good life
Got me a good girl that I'm gon make me a good wife
So I'm, good to go, and I'm good where I go
Look my man got good aim and that's a good thing to know

Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they Jacob? Don't lie to me, man
See, a part of me sayin' ""Keep shining""
How? When I know what a blood diamond is
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connects to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus-piece was so harmless
Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life trying to get that ice
Bought a Polo rugby, it looks so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike

YG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere

What I've been saying practically my whole career
A diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever

But lookin' back now shoulda' gone to the crib
And rented ""Gone With the Wind,"" cause I'da gone about 10
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talkin shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is tellin' me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for 20 years, doin' time behind bars

Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
30 minutes later sein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call, you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like ""Amen""
R-r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they Jacob? Don't lie to me, man
See, a part of me sayin' ""Keep shining""
How? When I know what a blood diamond is
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connects to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus-piece was so harmless
Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life trying to get that ice
Bought a Polo rugby, it looks so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight

(Diamonds are forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(Forever)

People asking me ""Is I'm gon' give my chain back?""
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog, ""Yo where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance that bring our rain back
""What's up with you and Jay, man?
Are y'all okay man?""

Yup, I got it from here 'Ye, damn
The chain remains, the gang is intact
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gonna crack?
Haha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep
I sold kilos of coke, I'm guessin' I can sell CDs
I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man!
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere
Oh yeah, he don't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money, last 3 lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear saying exactly
What I've been saying practically my whole career
A diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time
(I'm Young, bitches)
Good night!",Diamonds from Sierra Leone [Remix],2005
Kanye West,"Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

My homie Marley used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin', sixteen he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
With the girls a lotta flirtin' involved, but dawg
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryna get in some drawers, so
Put me on with these hoes homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow homie

Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

What it do? I'm posted up in the parkin' lot, my trunk wavin'
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazin'
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neon's lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fo's crawlin', you see them screens fallin'
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leanin' on the switch, sittin' crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' somethin' candy coated, crawlin' like a caterpillar
I'm tippin' on them four's, I'm jammin' on that Screw
I'm lookin' for them hoes baby what it do, drive slow homie

Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes (drive slow homie)
If you ridin' around the city with nowhere to go (drive slow homie)
Live today cause tomorrow man, you never know

You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TV's in here than where I live

And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's somethin' serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics baby it's evident
You see a player flickin', and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, ""Just a Lil' Bit"" (just a lil' bit)
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin', through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know

Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin
With all the rest of the muh'fuckers underachievin
Man, this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo

That night (that night) that night
Baby it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian like
Hmmm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later
I'll be there in five minutes, go 'head ride with it

Better than a chick that say yes to soon
Until you have a daughter, that's what I call karma
And you pray to god she don't grow breasts too soon.

Niggas hats broke off that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorty's write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up

Nigga come through flickin' and he had that shine
Put two and two together in a little bad weather

First line, should it be about the hos or the ice?
Four-four's or black Christ? Both flows would be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man's plight
At the studio console asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic
Picked up the pad and pencil and jotted what I feel
Been like 12 years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent
And I'm thinking it's time
To build my very own Motown
Cause rappers be deprived of executive 9 to 5s
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony where King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Lasting longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke.

Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me

There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive

And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (hey mama)

(Hey mama) I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (hey mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (hey mama)

Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin' to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me""
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, y'all say Mama, now everybody answer me (hey mama)

(Hey mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (hey mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (hey mama)

I guess it also depends though, if my ends low
Second they get up you gon' get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (hey mama)

Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'mma get you a jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say (hey mama)

(Hey mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (hey mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school

I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin in when I feel like
To turn this muh'f***er up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin in when I feel like
To turn this muh'f***er up only if it feels right

Stop all your blood claat cryin, I was flyin
Made it to school with barely 'nuff time to sign in
Yeah I hear the alarm, yeah I hear you mom
Yeah yeah I don't wan' be broke when I'm 31
They said the best cla**es go to the fastest
Sorry Mr. West there's no good cla**es, and that's what yo' a** get
Not even electives? Not even prerequits?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop cla** or the basket weavin
With all the rest of the muh'f***ers underachievin
Man, this is a insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just notice at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benz-o?
Like old folks pissin, I guess it all (Depends), oh, oh
... Stop you're cryin baby

[Chorus]


You know when you be late you miss all the lights
That's right (that's right) that's right (that's right)
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight
That night (that night) that night
Baby it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian like
Hmmm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later
I'll be there in five minutes, go 'head ride with it
I'm so live with it, look how I did it
Been bulls***tin but I finally arrived with it
I know it's late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin cause I'm finally here, yeah

Kanye West,"Yeah
They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin' sense of it we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game it's another name, for life fightin'
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale, ""Behold the Pale, Horse""
Got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it

""Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
I'm on my way home

Hey chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was 9?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin' like what kind of doctor can we fly in?
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma was in the NBA
Right now she'd be okay? But since she
Was just a secretary, worked for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here
My grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he's strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse ""Did you do the research?""
She asked me, ""Can you sign some t-shirts?""
Bitch, is you smokin' reefer?
You don't see that we hurt? But still

I smile when roses come to see me
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

They outside of the emergency room
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now she asleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Clay and Aunt Jean
So many Aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie, it's just ""One Thing""
When they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all-time high
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive
Cause with my family we know we know where home is
And so instead of sendin' flowers, we the roses

That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talked about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
It's for yourself, that's important

While I smoke a b, you can preferably find that I'm a G
And all this (well well well well)

You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light,  move it to some Isaac

Bumping r&b, and I got the leaf, on the 23's
And I do it (well well well well)

I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment controlling me
I love the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass, you be bumping Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see

One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street form Calumet a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
Walk around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Dayton's in his hand
Keys in his hand reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Alesis he had dreams of Caprice's
Drove by the teachers even more by police's
How he get that cash today his father passed away
Left him with a little somthin' 16 he was stuntin'
Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit lake shore girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway go at least bout 80
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby
See back back then then if you had a car
You were the Chi town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cracked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had the Lincoln's and Aurora's we were hurting them all
And there was a lot of flirting involved
But dawg fuck all that flirting I'm trying to get in some draws
So put me on with these hoes homey's
He said don't rush to get grown drive slow homey
Drive slow homie
Drive slow
Ya never know homey about these hoes homey
Ya need to pump your breaks and drive slow homey

What It do
I'm posted up in the parking lot my trunk wavin'
The candy gloss is immaculate and is simply amazing
Them elbows poking wide on that Candy-lac
Trunnk open screens on neon's lit with
I'm on a mission for dime piece's and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them 4's crawlin', you see them screens fallin'
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leanin' on a switch sittin' crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boopas if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla
Riding some candy coated crawlin' like a caterlippar
I'm tippin' on those 4's I'm jamming off this screw
I'm lookin' for them hoes baby what it do?

Drive slow homey
Turn your hard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow homey
If you ridin' around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow homey
Live today 'cause tomorrow you never know
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey

My cars like the movies my cars like the crib
I got more TV's in here then where I live

And it don't make no sense but bay I'm the shit
And everything I flip you know is something serious
I got the custom grill I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics baby that's evident
You see a player flicking and you ain't convinced
That you should go and kiss it just a little bit
I wear my custom kicks I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleaming though my angle wings
They see me hoes acting like they seen a king
With that mean lean smoking on the finest Cali green
My wood grain oak I'm riding on vogues
My cylinder quiet like tip toes
I sold O's and this I know
When you see them hoes little homey drive slow

Chopped and Screwed
Yeah
Drive slow homey
Drive slow homey
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey

Kanye West,"Last night me and my dawg were hanging out
Tired of being cramped up in the house
We were simply celebrating life
Off from work today so it's alright
But all those ups and downs had me in a twist
Started dancing with this model chick
And then every record became my favorite song
And that is all that I remember

'Cause I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the Embassy
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza

I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the Embassy

When I woke up from last night's avoutrie
Baby girl was laying next to me
Shoes and clothes were scattered everywhere
I got dressed and got up out of there
But not before I called for me a cab
Hung over from all the drinks I had
And now I'm telling my story to you
Everything that I remember

I had one too many drinks

Or, or leave the club now
Do like I did, come back when u get dough
A fishstick nigga now we messing with lobsters
We messin' with Grammies, we messin' with Oscars
You messin' with that dranky drank
Plus you puffin' on that stanky stank
In the morning you gon' draw a blank
The hotel said y'all was on 'em
My girl wasn't on shit, I picked the wrong one
Steady talkin' bout I ain't like them other girls
Well tonight I'm tryin' to find them other girls
Bring they own rubber girl

Damn, damn, ma, we ain't even have to go through it like that
It wasn't even, even that big, man
You know, nah, it's ight though
But anyway, yo, let me get that coat
Let me get those jeans, and let me get that rock on your finger
Oh, it's stuck? Then I'll take the whole finger than, man
Let me get those bags from Paris, and the puppies is staying, yo!

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Come through the block, in the brand new Benz
Knowing that billionaires do they friends
(OK girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get your man back like that
Bouncin' around, when I'm up in these streets
Knowing that billionaires do got beef
(OK girl) Yo, what I did was wack
But you don't get your man back like that, no

[Ghostface Killah]
Hey yo, I should just bark on you, burn your car on you
Cause I'm too much man, to leave a mark on you
You'se a bird you know that, giving that man
Ten points, like he about to blow that
He probably did, you swallow his kids?
In and out of jail, he a snail, he wasn't wilding on bids
In the summertime, I broke his jaw, had to do it, to him
Quick, old fashion, in the back of the mall
Me and him had 'mos forever, like I'm supposed to put him on
When he came home and told on Trevor
Had to bang on homey, ear blocks, out in spots
Throwing them shots, like 'sucker, you know me'
Stop fronting for them people out, side like you really ride
And you a silly chick, thought you was really live
But I guess I was wrong, I'ma holla at dog
And rip his head off, words of a song

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Hey yo, I thought we was iller than that, all them kisses
And love yous, when jake came, you hid my packs
It was time a brother went to war, vests banged up
Staining in the kitchen, yo, holding a four
Sweatin' and breathing, bounced out of town for a weekend
Heard you had homey in the passenger seating
Honey, look, I'm a monster don, I do monster things
That's why I put your ass under my arm
Messing with him can bring bodily harm
And where you gonna hide in the streets when the body is gone
If it's one thing I learned that, never trust a female
On no scale, you just confirmed that
Bounce to your momma house, pack your shit
I don't care if you crying, you'se a ruthless chick
Gots to watch you, these eyeballs in my face'll spot you
My girl cousins, they gon' rock you

[Chorus]

[Ne-Yo]
Shorty what is you thinking bout
Didn't I put you down
Flyest whips, rollin' round like yea
That's the bosses chick, on the side
I might of had, one or two
Them silly broads wasn't nothing on you
Rolling with him, tryin' to get revenge
That's what you just don't do

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
I'm a good dude, you see, yeah,
Females out there that wanna be
Acting like they getting they little revenge off
Taking it further than what it really is

You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it - get off my (brand new) dick

[Verse: Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
Now ain't - that about a bitch
And I'ma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They don't want to turn they speakers up they claim I ain't deep enough
All that talkin' I feed off of - keep it up
I'm relaxin' my feet is up - I'm leavin' you haters
Like when Shaq left the Lakers just to ""Heat"" it up
I state the stats to stunt - I don't need to front
I make history e'ry day - I don't need a month
The survey says - by the streets according
Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan
Was to the NBA when he was scorin'
Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and..

Some of y'all know you wear a sixteen - squeezin' into a six
Damn - what you make them jeans rip for?
I guess she's lookin' for a brand new man who
Ain't always gotta sit down cause he can't stand you
Boo - this the brand new jam to dance to
While you givin' me ""Head"" like shampoo - come as you came
Skip the brand name - I won't brand you
What you do here'll stay here like Cancun
Besides your breasts is augmented - I like things authentic
Look at all my whips, they're all vintage
I got a loft with a view of the sea
See I take some more shit and make it new for me
Pimp it out like Xzibit to the (oomph) degree
Why spend and arm and a leg - we can kick it for free you see..

I'm like ""Ma'am - I don't agree with that decision
Nothin' against him - but if he step I got to diss him
I listen to that weak shit - all of it - I can't follow it

""I worked too hard to get my baby ballin' kid!""
Down the fives - had me blue collar poppin' it
Now I'm in the club - and look who I get it poppin' with
Me and 'Ye go back like crew cuts
He hook me up - as long as I don't ask him for too much
But even he know 'Fest is layin' it down

Kanye West,"Yeah, this joint right here man, is for all my blue collar niggaz
In the Midwest goin through our struggle
We know things could be better, huh
And we just want a little mooore

No matter how much I get (I want mooore)
Even when I talk my shit (I want mooore)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this
But still (I want mooore)

Look now I ain't goin for the okey-doke (nope)
You owe me dough, you better pay me like you know we broke
This industry be tryin to strangle niggaz in the choke
You think these rappers rich? These niggaz out here sellin dope
You think it's crazy sayin, ""If I had what he had""
But if you had what he had, nigga you'd be mad
Three kids, see dad broke-ass waitin on the royalties with no cash
Nice car, no gas, stuck at the pump
Had a lil' hot single now he's stuck in a slump
At the top of his section eight, straight waitin to jump
Like Milli Vanilli, now people just look at him silly
Sayin ""That's umm - I forgot his name - who is he?""
He wanted (mooore) never really thought of the loss
Lookin for (mooore) everybody playin the boss
To get (mooore) now he just stuck in the sauce
Like white kids when they got cut off, ""Daddy I want.."" (mooore)

They'll take it and bro, break in your phone, call your boss up
(Where that nigga at?) Or tell your wife to try to break up your home
Now your baby momma takin your son, learn from mistakes I done
Yesterday we all naked and fun
I ain't thinkin of none, break in and cum, soon as you done run
This is real talk, nigga one-on-one
Between me and you, now this mono-a-mono
How you gon' catch mono from a hoe that work at McDonald's
Now you lookin like the clown like Ronald
That's where Kels fucked up, cause young girls he decided to fondle
And I ain't fin' ta let HIV's in my bag
I'll start usin rubbers again, it ain't that bad
You gotta take care of yourself mayne, don't get grabbed
Cause if you die, people be like ""Aww that's too bad""

Everybody so weak like, like, they afraid to speak
If you see that nigga violate then hit him in his cheek
Tryin to act like, like, you reppin the street
You ain't a gangsta, you a bitch with a beat
So it's time to make role call, then expose y'all
Adam & Eve shocked in the garden with no drawers
While niggaz gettin popped on my block with no laws
I grew up with Disciples that'll smash ya gold off
I never plugged, cause I know that when you do that shit
You locked in for life, nigga yeah, etched in blood
But it's hard to get respect when you less than thug
And you ain't fin' to serve here if you ain't with us
Us meanin them, them meanin G.D.
Gangster Disciples, the same ones that killed Cochise
So see, how he, well he, meanin me
Refused to be another nigga dead in the street

Kanye West,"I done been around the world, been around the block
Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac
Like Vida Guerra, ass took her to the top
She'll give you some brain, you let her throw up the Roc
Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cot
Picture that, like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set
Puttin' oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez
She was Eye Candy in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she wouldn't get far cause five hundred dollars
Can't get you that far, how you get that far
And all these new video bitches tryin to be Melyssa Ford
But they don't know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen, but behind closed doors
She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards, ha ha

You wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
You wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed
It would be just a waste of time
But you know, you wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

Pop quiz, how many topless, black foxes
Did I have under my belt, like boxers
Not to brag but, if it add up
One, two, nigga that's mad nuts
Game you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these
Bitches knowin' damn well they gon' call me
The only dream, of that ghetto prom queen
Was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen
Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team
Head so good he don't ask for a pre---nup
Now ask yourself this question, umm
Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo
Would you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo
Well why the hell you think these bitches comin' at me fo'
But since they all fall in my Palm, I take a trio, yo

You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
You wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed
It would be just a waste of time
But you know, you wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

I done had my share of bitches with long hair
Short do like Kelis or Halle in Boomerang, yeah
I been around the block in the Bentley drop top
In Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fuckin with Scott
I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case
She'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes
And ain't nobody tryin' to take Beyonce from Jay
But I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day
The things niggas do when pussy sittin' on they face
Stabbed Un in the stomach
She must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman, on that superhero shit
Fly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo'
Impala, forget the double D's
I put 'em right in your face like that model bitch Toccara
And she ain't win the show but she ridin' in that Gallardo
That's why I fuck 'em today and forget 'em tomorrow

You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
You wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed
It would be just a waste of time

You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

God damn, you know what I'm sayin'
I'm sittin' back watchin' Kanye video
And I see the same bitch that was in the homeboy Busta Rhymes video
Then I flip the muh'fuckin channel
Checkin' out my uncle Snoop Dogg video
And I see the same bitch, that was in my video
You know what I'm sayin'
And then y'knahmsayin, to make that even mo' fucked up

that really knows how to make a girl feel (girl feel, feel)
I just wanna know

You wanna deal wit' an O-G that's truly respected
Touch you in every spot that them dudes neglected
A dude that won't flirt, a dude put her to work
Beat it up til it hurt, she like uh uh uh (OK)
And you're the only one that I really wanna chill wit'
I know how you dude to make you feel missed
I take the front of ma, show you the realness
All nigga really needs is a lil' bit
From a hood chick lookin' straight off the runway
Won't bite her tongue, shorty'll say what she wan' say
From Sunday to Monday
She gon' ride whether it's in back of the Phantom or in back of the Hyundai
Not the fake baler throwin' cream in your face
Or dude that won't fall til he cream in your
Or dude to see you walkin' in them jeans and wanna taste
I'm who the call when they wanna steam up the place (Joe)

As he wavin' his shorty hi, you know he showin' his bling out
She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out
His girl call, feelin' she mad, she threw the ring out

How she found out, she dreamt the whole thing out
Y'all be goin' through problems you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep, what do you think 'bout?
If y'all get a divorce she gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out

Make it so cold that you gotta pull ya mink out
Or grab ya roller skates and, turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle
Meanwhile, she out, doin' the same thing now
Nightmares from your dream gal make ya scream out

Yo' plan is to stick out yo' hand real quick
So if he feed ya family and he serve you shit
Then he need that head you get and he deserve your bitch

Since you wishin' cash fall from the sky all ya life
Dwellin' on the past when you was alright
When you was gettin' cash but wasn't too bright
Now ya luck down you feel like, bustin' them shells

Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self
Want niggaz to show you, how to come up wit' green
I scheme since I'm fourteens, what the fuck was your dream?
Rental cars, little broads, sayin' you was seen

Wit' little niggaz wit' a chain you was doin' ya thing
How high was I? You the thousandth guy
That came around thinkin' we can see, eye to eye
We on a different echelon, coulda got bread together
Now you gets deaded on

She had several cars, she had credit cards, a castle
Large master bathroom, gettin' a pedicure
Belaney by the glassful, said she been meanin' to ask who
Would need a cash rule, who could blast tools

And I'm eatin' cashews, knew she was bad news
But we mad cool, nothin' sexual 'cause I knew her since high school
Grew up wit' my dudes, like one of my crews
She worked for Fox News

One of her mans that she lent her drop to
Won't come back wit' it so she want him clapped in it
Says it's important that it looks like an accident
She was snortin' and her eyes had bags in it

Sheets was recordin had a wire, askin' shit
Four days before I came by she got bagged wit' bricks
Crossed the line from her world of news castin'
To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards

I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine

Baby, I'm going on an airplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different

Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm trying to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

Will be left far behind

If you listen to this earth
And you ask the Lord for guidance
And you'll see the many blessings
Have you been in on the glory
Have you came to just adore the
You read all of His stories

Change the way you feel inside

Can tell you what you're worth
Stand up you're a child of a king
And you can do anything

You try to please everyone to
Time to live your life, release those old delusions
Stop wasting time and start embracing
His light and let it shine

Count your blessings when they say
Oh it ain't no way but what matters
Never stop believing in yourself
But in the Lord God and you'll see
All the answers that free you from change
That would seem to keep you standing still

Since 86 showing the crowd what I'm about
And they still want to know when the album coming out
Ask the teenagers, OG's and Ask the kids
What they definition of Classic is
Timeless, cause age don't count in the booth
And your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth
And no doubt the truth I'm off the meters
Everybody co-signing even non-believers
I came in the door, became one of y'alls leaders
In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers
Uptown we call 'em uppies when they on divas
Probably worn when KRS One teaches
Nas, made you look, before the haters
I bet you Kan had 'em on when he walked with Jesus
This is classic

Classic, better than I've ever been

If it's classic it's gonna last forever than 
I'm everywhere you never been and better than I ever been
Classic
Better than I've ever been

Can't buy this, super flyness, like a shyness, your highness
It's performing, look how long the line is
That's what happens when you make shit that's timeless
That's what happens these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?
That's so novice, I'm so polished, I got a right to be a little bit snobbish
I did a little bit of college, semesters it took 2 like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasn't my place, the beat slowed til you listened to my pace
Cause I be killing shit, but that's evident, and y'all feeling it, but I expected it
If it's classic it's gonna last forever than 
I'm everywhere you never been and better than I ever been

Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper to them it hurts to hear this
Oh you went platinum, yeah that's nice, now let me see you do the same thing twice
New times, 4 times, then been a couple of more times, please your amateur night is show time
It's one life to live so live it the best you can, the world could use one less man
Not enough air, not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans and vans
When they do make the whip you like ya chips ain't right, 
By the time you could afford it the car ain't important
In the streets silent, it's just I and, cops keep firing in my environment
Leaving your slum when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager to jump on
I like to be the wall that they post up on, I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong
I'm classic like the Air Ones, the Hustler shoe, that's what I'm accustomed to

How many y'all got criminal minded you you you y'all don't be blinded
Me I got no jewels on my neck, why, I don't need 'em I got your respect
KRS 1 20 years I rock I do it for JMJ and Scott LaRock, this hip hop
And we's a nation, don?t you want to hear more KRS on your radio station?
Instead of broadcasting how we smoking trees, on the radio we need to hear more local MC's
Where you at? Come on where you at? This is the difference between MC'ing and rap
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal, MC's spit rhymes to uplift they people
Peace, love, unity, and having fun, these are the lyrics of KRS One",Better Than I've Ever Been,2007

Yes, welcome to the wonderful sounds of Talib Kweli

Ladies...

I got you in the mood, for an interlude,
Raw like in the nude, I hope this ain't considered rude,
But let's stop talkin, cause it's feelin like an interview,
I know you into me, so, let me get into you,
I'm always in the mood for laughin and lovin and rappin and *fcukin*, And passin the dutch and Relaxin and puffin and hittin and duckin,
The rippin production, these kittens ain't muffins,
Just because we stuff 'em in the oven,
My words drippin off the tongue like the wax from a candle wick,
Ill the way I lay down the rap, they can't handle it,
Cats all sappy like romantic flicks, dude, get a clue,
Like Colonel Mustard in the study with a candlestick,
They holdin hands with these dudes like they goin steady,
But, one glimpse and I know they ready, you already know,
Slipped her a note like, 'you ready to go?'
We make a getaway plan and we head for the do'!

[Chorus] x 2
I wear the night like a cloak 'cause I move with the stars,
Navigate through the truly bizarre,
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life,
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight,

Kanye:
You messin up my mo', my whole mood, told y'all, oh,
Lose, eat crews like crews like soulfood,
The only producer that feel like ""fuck rappers!""
Only backpacker with a chip like hackers,
Only Michael Richardson, only much blacker,
So if he say nigga, then I'ma say *cracker*,
Is this the Ritz? Carlton? Dress like, fresh, like, just like..
I'm the shit (Uggh)
You ain't figured out what I'm about yet,
Always rockin that 'this ain't out yet',
But this ain't 'bout that,
From a city where niggas plug like outlets,
Far as music go yo, it ain't no outlets, so,
When I go out, niggas always out to get me in the studio,
And I ain't in the mood to flow,
I'm with my girl and I'm tryin to hit the movies yo,
And they tryna act stupid, oh!
In the club with Silicone Suzie,
What happened to real girls like Rudy?
With real titties like Tooty,
This girl got a silicone booty!
And got the nerve to act moody!
Now I ain't tryin to judge like Judy,
But bitch you a man, you can't fool me!
Act like Fifty, throw her in a pool G...

[Chorus] x 2

Talib: Break it down

Bringin the drum, keep it funky like a stink in a slum,
'Cause see they wanna breed cursin for the things that don't come
The speakers wrong that we rap dudes speakin in tongues
Christmas time choice for what? No we keepin our guns
Smokin a piff to cause a leak in your lungs,
You ain't got shit to do like Friday when the weekend begun,
Completely done with rap dudes - don't compete with the dumb,
I spill my blood for the people, see how deep it can run?
I'm in the mood like Dante and Main Flow,
Never comin with the same flow, got it's change, yo
It's strange yo, to make yo chain glow, that's yo main goal
That's a facade like I'm somewhere over the rainbow
Really these cats sweeter than mangoes, Mr Bonjangles-ass dudes,
Dancin around the club, doin the tango,
Go hard like Iverson playin with hurt ankles,
Plus, wrestle the topic from a different Kurt Angle!

Sell out, picture us in the mall
Copin iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yea that's what we would yell out, yell out
You know the name, do gotta spell out or tell bout
J a y an Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind he could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you could brag to your friends back at the gig
But he got me out my mama crib

Nothing handed out, I'm about to take mine
Around the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little song in that old back room
He would bob his head and say, damn, oh, that's you
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
Party at S.O.B's and we had packed the crowd
Big brother got his show up in Madison Square
And I'm like yea, yea we gonna be there
But not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carleen told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinking a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm at the top and everybody on the scrotum

Not only a client, the presidito, Hola Hovito
The game getting foul, so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peep hole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now I'm on a steep hole
And we know
New jack city gotta keep my brother
But to be number 1, I'm a beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I'd spaz
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was driving me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kick a flow it was like, pick and roll
'Cause even if he gave me the rock, its give and go
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
but I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo
Y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Cold Play
Next thing I know he got a song with Cold Play
Back in my mind I'm like damn, no way
Translate español
No way Jose
Then I went and told J Brown
Should of known that was gonna come back around
Should of told you like a man, should of told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse

My big brother was Big's brother
So here's a few words from your kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go ahead and tell um
People never get the flowers while they could still smell um
A idol in my eyes, God of the game
Heart of the city, Rockafella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number 1 young Hov also my big brother

My big Brother was Bigs brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs Brother
Who was hip hops brother
Who was No I.D's friend
No I.D my mentor, and that's where the story ends

She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me

Kanye West,"Is y?all ready for Twenty-0-7, it?s now another drought 
Everyone?s a killer, wow we buggin out 
Since 86 showin the crowd what I?m about 
And they still want to know when the album comin? out 
Ask the teenagers, O?Gs and Ask the kids 
What they definition of Classic is 
Timeless, cause age don?t count in the booth 
And your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth 
And no doubt the truth I?m off the meters 
Everybody co-signing even non-believers 
I came in the door, became one of y?alls leaders 
In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers 
Uptown we call ?em uppies when they on divas 
Prolly worn when KRS One teaches 
Nas, made you look, before the haters 
I bet you Kan had ?em on when he walked with Jesus 
This is classic 

classic, better than I'v ever been
Talent, 
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 
Classic
Better than I'v ever been

[Kanye West:]
Can?t buy this, superflyness, like a shyness, your highness 
It?s performin?, look how long the line is 
That?s what happens when you make shit that?s timeless 
That?s what happens these rappers is the pioneers 
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is? 
That?s so novice, I?m so polished, I got a right to be a little bit snobbish 
I did a little bit of college, semesters it took 2 like Rob Base 
To let me figure out this wasn?t my place, the beat slowed til? you listened to my pace 
'cause I be killin? shit, but that?s evident, and y?all feelin? it, but I expected it 
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 

classic, better than I'v ever been
Talent, 
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 
Classic
Better than I'v ever been

[Nas:] 
Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper to them it hurts to hear this 
O you went platinum ? yeah that?s nice, now let me see you do the same thing twice 
New times, 4 times, then been a couple of more times, please your amateur night is show time 
It?s one life to live so live it the best you can, the world could use one less man 
Not enough air, not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans and vans 
When they do make the whip you like ya chips ain?t right, by the time you could afford it the car ain?t important 
In the streets silent, it?s just I and - cops keep firin? in my environment 
Leavin? your slum when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager to jump on 
I like to be the wall that they post up on, I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong 
I?m classic like the Air Ones, the Hustler shoe, that?s what I?m accustomed to 

classic, better than I'v ever been
Talent, 
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 
Classic
Better than I'v ever been

[KRS One:] 
How many y?all got criminal minded you you you y?all don?t be blinded 
Me I got no jewels on my neck, why ? I don?t need ?em I got your respect 
KRS 1 20 years I rock I do it for JMJ and Scott LaRock ? this hip hop 
And we?s a nation, don?t you want to hear more KRS on your radio station? 
Instead of broadcasting how we smokin? trees, on the radio we need to hear more local MC?s 
Where you at? Come on where you at? This is the difference between MC?ing and rap 
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal, MC?s spit rhymes to uplift they people 
Peace, love, unity, and Havin? fun, these are the lyrics of KRS One

All my fault to be a real boy, chasin' the American dream
Chasin' everything we seen, up on the TV screen

And the hoes was left, you talk the hoes to death

Armor All flow cause it never get rusty
I ain't gotta say it, man dawg trust me
Bust somebody head, GLC where was we?
Still rock the Prada 'fore that, rock the Starter
Niggas had the Georgetown, the Magic way harder
Thinking back to the projects, and they way they tore 'em all up
Like when I do a project, and come back and tear the mall up

South (side), Side of the Chi

[Common]
The broads, the cars, the half moon, the stars
I'm like Jeff Fort the way I get behind bars
Burn CDs with no regard for the stars
Come to the crib with conflict diamonds and they ours
Back in '94 they call me Chi-town's Nas
Now them niggas know I'm one of Chi-town's gods
We eating Joe, you still talking no carbs
A conscious nigga with mac like Steve Jobs

Your fly is open, McFly
The crowd is open I think I know why
I'm back from the future seen it with my own eyes
And yep, I'm still the future of the Chi
Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon
I knew that I couldn't cop a coup with no coupons
Look at that neutron on his green like crutons
People asking him, ""Do you have any grey poupon?""

You in the building but the buildings falling
You wouldn't be ballin' if your name was Spalding
My mind get flooded I think about New Orleans
Bout to school y'all niggas, you should call him August
I'm the sun that goes down but I'm still revolving
Southside walk it out, while still you're crawlin'
If rap was Harlem, I be James Baldwin
With money in the bank like G. Rap, we're calling

With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas
Can't wait till they say, ""Ye ran up at the Oscars.""
Poppa, I heard his life is like a movie
Like when Em' played him and Mekhi played a rasta
Mexicans gonna love it like it was for La Raza
But this is for the mobsters, Holla
We some true chi-town legends, accept no imposters

[Hook]

[Common]
Uh, the un-American idol, tower like the Eiffel
Lean wit it, rock wit it, Black like the Disciples
Know when to use a bible, and when to use a rifle
You rap like you should be on the back of a motorcycle
Caught a case of robbery, and 'Beat It' like Michael
Your career is a typo, mine was written like a haiku
I write to 'Do the Right Thing' like Spike do
Through Conflicts that's Crucial and Drama that's Psycho

Kanye West,"Memories on corners with the fours and the moes 
Walk to the store for the rose talking straightforward to
Got uncles that smoke it some put blow up they nose
To cope with they lows the wind is cold and it blows
In they socks and they souls holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed hoping for more
With nowhere to go rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way cause they ain't knowing they goal
The streets ain't safe cause they ain't knowing he code
By the fours I was told either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a ""Olds"" with windows that don't roll
Down the roads where cars get broke in and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

I wish I could give ya this feeling
I wish I could give ya this feeling
On the corners, niggas robbing, killing, dying
Just to make a living (huh)

We underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when times stood still
And gators and snakes gangs and yellow and pink
And colored blue profiles glorifying that

Streetlights and deep nights cats trying to eat right
Riding no seat bikes with work to feed hypes
So they can keep sweet Nike's they head and they feet right
Desires of streetlife cars and weed types
It's hard to breath nights days are thief like
The beast roam the streets the police is Greeklike
Game at it's peak we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
Its steep life coming up where sheeplike
Rappers and hoopers we strive to be like
G's with 3 stripes seeds that need light
Cheese and weaves tight needs and thieves strike
The corner where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong cause it's hard to see right
Look to the sky hoping it will bleed light
Reality's and I heard that she bites
The corner

I wish I could give ya this feeling
I wish I could give ya this feeling
On the corners, niggas robbing, killing, dying
Just to make a living (huh)

The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dancers and
War cries that broke out on different corners
Power to the people, black power, black is beautiful

Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burger its
Cats with gold permanents move they bags as herbalist
The dirt isn't just fertile its people working and earning this
The curb-getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It's so hot that burn to live the furnace is
Where the money move and the determined live
We talk play lotto and buy German beers
It's so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

I wish I could give ya this feeling
I wish I could give ya this feeling
On the corners, niggas robbing, killing, dying
Just to make a living (huh)

The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument,
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace and to love

Whatchu doin' in here anyway? You oughta be home with your momma
How old are you boy? Thirteen
Thirteen? Damn, the bastards must be runnin' outta niggaz to arrest

Yeah, oh yeah, this goes out to all the families
That went through the struggle
Yeah, from the heart
It was from the heart, everything was real

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Yo, dwellin' in the past, flashbacks when I was young
Whoever thought that I'd have a baby girl and three sons
I'm goin' through this difficult stage, I find it hard to believe
Why my old Earth had so many seeds

But she's an old woman and due to me, I respect that
I saw life for what it's really worth and took a step back
Family ain't family no more, we used to play ball
Eggs after school, eat grits 'cause we was poor

Grab the pliers for the channel, fix the hanger on the TV
Rockin' each others pants to school wasn't easy
We survived winters, snotty nosed with no coats
We kept it real, but the older brother still had jokes

Sadly, daddy left me at the age of six
I didn't know nuttin' but mommy neatly packed his shit
She cried, and grandma held the family down
I guess mommy wasn't strong enough, she just went down

Check it, fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
Roaches everywhere, cousins and aunts was there
Four in the bed, two at the foot, two at the head
I didn't like to sleep with Jon Jon, he peed the bed

Seven o'clock, pluckin' roaches out the cereal box
Some shared the same spoon, watchin' Saturday cartoons
Sugar water was our thing, every meal was no thrill
In the summer, free lunch held us down like steel

And there was days, I had to go to Tex house with a note
Stating, ""Gloria can I borrow some food I'm dead broke""
So embarrasin', I couldn't stand to knock on they door
My friends might be laughin', I spent stamps in stores

Mommy, where's the toilet paper, use the newspaper
Look Ms. Rose gave us a couch, she's the neighbor
Things was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats
Two brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me

But I remember this, mom's would lick her finger tips
To wipe the cold out my eye before school wit her spit
Case worker had her runnin' back to face to face
I caught a case, housin' tried to throw us out of our place

Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyze the sky
And ask myself was I meant to be here, why?
Yeah, yo

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Word up mommy, I love you
Word up
It was all you, word, you brought me in like this

I sit and think about all the times we did without, yeah
I always said I wouldn't cry when I saw tears in your eyes
I understand that daddy's not here now
But some way or somehow, I will always be around, yeah

All things that I did from this to them
Oh, from drugs to being there
Being down and out and I love you always

Yeah, you say you see the universe
Which consists of the sun, moon and star
And them planets, that exist in my space
Like man woman and child, you understand?

We got to keep it real, and what reality
And reality will keep it real with us
I remember them good ol' days
Because see, that's the child I was

What made me the man I am today
See 'cause if you forget where you come from, heheh
You're never gonna make it where you're goin', aheh
Because you lost the reality of yourself

So, take one stroll through your mind
And see what you will find
And you'll see a whole universe all over again
And again and again and again and again
Heheheh, yeah, heheheheh, aha, heheheh

Got her toes done up, wit her finger nails matchin'
Got her toes done up wit her finger nails matchin'
Got Got her toes done up wit her finger nails matchin'
Toes, toes done up wit her finger nails matchin'

[Verse One]
Shake it up up rock your body and
Make it knock knock when you're partyin'
Take a break break in the audience
Do your footwork break and stop again
I'm lookin' sharp you can't compete with a champ
Steady flickin' I'm holdin' down that law-away rack
Aye, rhinestones all in they face
Gold charms and paper chase
Talk smack from around the way
Gotta put these chicken heads in they place
I ain't rockin' no stupid bapes
Ain't trippin' I'll juke all day
I ain't slippin' cause either way
When I hit the block all the people say

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Aye yo this mutherfuckin' jammin'
I'm on it it's an anthem
Who is that in the phantom?
Please no cameras
They gone have me on concrete-loop in my pajamas
To hide the goods I would need pants big as Hammer's
I be tippin' them dancers
They be sayin' I'm handsome
I was pretty before the dough

But now I'm just the man
You remind me of my old chick
On that eighty four shit
Oh shit
Did you see the way she got her toes did?


[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Girls be so thirsty thirsty
Fast forward to the end of my song
And say third verse me verse me
Whenever I hit block I see
Tricks try to rehearse me hearse me
From manicure sets to silky weaves
They be so grimey, nasty, bogus
Germy, dirty
Uh oh
Sho' did
You ain't slick
Nah, let the pioneer blast my shit
Wait a minute
Hold up
Bubble letters on my butt say ""Fresh""
Oops I'm a go
Nails like whoa

Top all gold
Colors on my nails
To the paint on my toes
Stay fresh I'm accustomed to gold

Right about this time raise your glasses,
What's my motivation, that ass is,
Start a conversation, like as if,
You really want to know about a day in that shit,
Go ahead and tell the dj to play swizz,
So I ain't gotta tell these hoes who I is,
Bitches hating again that's music too me ears,
What's you think my fuel was for all of the years?
Im inspired when people don't like me,
They keep me writing so exciting,
Man, the drama is so enticing,
I might just bite ''a'' motherfucker like tyson,
Just too fly'ed a motherfucker so change,
Trow your cash, that's cake and ice'in,
I ask'd her you buying?
She said no just sight-seeing,
Maybe that's just because you ain't found the right thing? yeah!

Keep tellin' me you got a man,
But he can't do what I can,
Let me, show you what you been missin',
Keep show'in you the minor thing,
Let me, show you the finer thing,
Let me, show you what your missin',

Let me show you what is like too be the wife
Of a nigga with a life,
That make your head spin around,
See it's funny because I know what you like,
But I be see'in you with nigga's that ain't right, round hard top,
Know'in that you really, really want's your top down,
Know'in it is really time too stop running around,
We don't live twice, only life once,
And I know you like nice,
So how you gone front on me?
Baby, im the boss jd,
With him it's a limit,
With me it's a spree,
He buy car's,
I write you poetry,
He send flowers,
I send Mercedes,
Like ye, say, heaven is anything that heaven ain't is,
And yes, I guess, I'm into trick'in of buiss,
But shit, if you had it like I got it,
The you got it as a kid,
You say the same thing to a girl,
That I just said

Keep tellin' me you got a man,
But he can't do what I can,
Let me, show you what you been missin',
Keep show'in you the minor thing,
Let me, show you the finer thing,
Let me, show you what you been missin',

The life I live, fit for a king,
Now all I need fine little dime that's sharin my shine you sit back and watch the haters go blind,

I'm not tryin' to keep it lost too a minimum,
If you associating been in em winning em, then I say I was nine out of ten of them,
Frankly I know been and them I like spending them,
You like the smooth and can white lend'in them,
You wan't a thug, hey I look good in a timb,
You might win some, but everybody lost one,
I put a check on that like air force one's,
It's easier to lose her then to find her, so wine her and dine her, and treat her to the finer,
Things, lines, from the top designers,
Bling, shine, like you tryin' to blind her,
These are just reminders,
Just too sign ''her'',
Show her you find ''her'',
Eight, one of a kind ''her'',
See alote of ass, and that one behind her!
Let's just say that im diggin that like a miner, ya digg

Keep tellin' me you got a man,
But he can't do what I can,
Let me, show you what you been missin',
Keep show'in you the minor thing,
Let me, show you the finer thing,

She had the maid outfit, it's all on her apron
I know a friend who got drunk and claim a fat bitch raped him

I heard that bitch hate men and she covers up her crotch

And she really into twisting facts like false statements

On what we been on as of late
See I was reading a late notice on the date that I wrote this, you hear
Time flies in the Leer
And you wonder where the day went
See I'm a leader in my field, but I'm behind on my truck payments
So this is something that could help you raise your head like hello
See this is not brown red or yellow
Not a white or black poem
This is a prayer to a guardian angel
To protect our fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, sons and daughters
Until we bring our troops back home
'Cause it feel like we all in the same platoon
And we'll all be extinct soon
If we continue to suffer from other people's crimes
I think we well overdo for change
This time
And I know they don't wanna see me cooped up in a Benz
They'd rather see me cooped up these pens
Therefore I release the ink that's cooped up in these pens
And let my art-ticulate
People are so slow to love, but so quick to hate
Now some things finna change because we say so
Lets stop looking at how bad things are
And focus on how well they may go
And this is a declaration
That we'll be fair again
Especially to those Americans
Who were Americans, before there were Americans
This is to a small young family that's booming out of space
There's room in outer space
This is to my people
The human race

I need you to take us to the promised land
Don't just make us promises
It's too late to let go of our hand

They say we need a prophet that can touch on the topics
And make it hot as the tropics
Well you got it (you got it)

Take us to the promise land
Don't just make us promises
It's too late to let go of our hand

Everybody saying please don't let go
I hear it over and over and over like a echo
I see it in my dreams, I feel the effect though
People drowning in debt
Somebody to the rescue
Everybody's saying we need something special
Nah man, we need something extra terrestrial
Outta this world, speak for us
Be the vessel
Outta the box, reach for it through the threshold
Uh, through all of the stress though
What's best of all, people screaming like a festival
Just applaud, this moment is special y'all

I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race but I've already won first place

I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
You got me thinkin' 'bout our life, a house and kids, yeah
Every morning I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around and you knocked me down
Knocked me down

Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

I never thought I'd hear myself say
Y'all go ahead, I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today
I used to be commander in chief of my pimp ship flyin' high

So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
And seemed to only take the head of football teams

And I was the class clown that always kept you laughin'
We were never meant to be baby, we just happened
So please don't mess up the trick
Hey young world I'm the new Slick Rick

They say I move to quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hour glass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes

How could a goddess ask someone that's only average for advice
OMG you listen to that bitch? Whoa it's me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it we was magic, I was flyin', now I'm crashin'
This is bad, real bad Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'ma ask 'em

Say you gotta take the good, the bad, happy and the sad
But when you bring a better future than I had in the past
'Cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again

I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
And if it hits better make it worth the first when it comes around

Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

Won't see it comin' when it happens but when it happens
You're gonna feel it let me tell you now
See when love comes it knocks you down
Won't see it comin' when it happens but when it happens
You're gonna feel it let me tell you now

But when we start making fires
We get ever so hot
Whether we like it or not
They say we can love who we trust
But what is love without lust?
Two hearts with accurate devotions
And what are feelings without emotions?

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
(x2)

I hang my hopes out on the line
Will they be ready for you in time
If you leave them out too long
They'll be withered by the sun
Full stops and exclamation marks
My words stumble before I start
How far can you send emotions?
Can this bridge cross the ocean?

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand

To make peace

Baby, just forget everything that you know 
Let's take it all the way back to hello 
They say you livin' like you died before 
I got a place that only I can go 
Let me take you to flight school 
(We'll learn to fly) 
Let me take you to flight school 
(Above all the lights) 
You've never been so high, kiss the ground goodbye 
And you say, damn baby how did you get that fly? 
Flight school 

I got the airplane passes, the aviator glasses
She be lookin fly like aviator classes
So classy, Jacqueline Onassis
Used to sneak and move like Ali, Cassius
Massive, like Kennedy's assassin
We was killin time like clocks in the casket
Perhaps its time to prevail
I'll show you Gotham City like I'm Christian Bale
I can be Barack and let you be Michelle
Miguel. Gizelle. Dress fresh as hell.
Louis. Gucci. Ye in that pastel
Adore Dior, ride down Lake Shore
She felt the vibe, I had to make sure
She felt deprived livin like she died
Slide with a G, now she felt revived
In town for the night, she's somebody wifey
The LE, she never seen these
So the moment I might seize
I done come up out the coma of livin life's dreams
When you wake up in the morning you join the flight team.

I got my superman power, my superman cape 
These the last hours, but superman late 
The clock is ticking, damn can you wait? 
Man, will he come back and save the day? 
Fly across the earth, put things in reverse 
I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse 
Certain things I can't doctor, and you say I'm the worst 
I ain't have enough patients, but I needed a nurse 
Got to come by my head let, see if my head ache 
Then get my head straight 
Then give my head great 
Every time I popped up like the VCR 
I took your breath away 
Then we performed CPR 
With all the cars, the clothes, the lights, the boats 
I guess I was just trying to sow my royal oats 
In the penthouse position, 
With penthouse bitches, 
See I pimped my crib, so I must exhibit 
Shit, these last years been a haze like Issac 
So I close my eyes 
Tighter than Asian eyes 
Get realized 
I got the same wings angels fly 
With Louie Vuitton feathers, now that some fly shit

Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fuckin' up my money so yeah I had to act sane

On a bathroom wall I wrote
""I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else"" (else, else, else)
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it and went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing harvesting the feelings, I'd rather be by my fucking self

You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable like can't nobody get control you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever you gon' told him too
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Chuck dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I ain't you're right girl
You probably find one of them ""I like art"" type girls
All of the lights, she was caught in the hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
And who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained

Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gon' for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing

You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again

I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said ""Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees""
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said ""'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!""

I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again

But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you"" and I just got through
Talking 'bout what niggas tryna do, just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town!

Kanye West,"In the midst of negativity, a positive site can be blurred
And the visions that we thought were good, seems to let evil occur
While still possessing our human form,
We live life searching for greatness since the day we was born
And as we bow our heads at night rich wealthy or poor with dislikes
We pray, asking for forgiveness for our sinful ways
With mind, body, spirit and faith
We pray
Amen

Yeah, you like that right? I wrote it myself by the way
Yo Young, Jeezy, Jizzle, Snowman
We gotta give the streets what they want man
Fuck the god damn sheet man
You gotta get it in bruh
Let's get it

You like that don't you?

And I don’t mean to be selfish
But I picture myself gettin’ paid
And you might catch pneumonia
'Cause I'm colder than an elf on a sleigh
Uh, me and Pusha back on it
Now everybody help us pray.
Lord forgive my sins and all my friends
Dollars make sense, I’m tryna get paid

Tryna get saved (too late)
Time to get paid
Got a gun and a stocking mask
Niggas thought I was tryna get waves
I’mma let y'all niggas pray for it
My young niggas knocking off a K for it
Sold my soul on the back end
Only fucking way I'ma pay for it
Front that shit you put a flame on
My niggas locked in a cage for
They keep telling me to go hard
Number one spot you was made for
Yeah, I made more
Front of the grill, got a racehorse
California Crayola red
Glow In The Dark like a ‘Ye tour
Fuck niggas steppin’ in my lane for
Not knowing that it’s a land mine
Soon as a nigga feel a cool breeze
Throw the top up like a gang sign
Red or blue, crip or blood
Solitaires, diamond studs
Like chandeliers I’ma flood
Black Jesus piece like it’s dipped in mud
Fashion God’s, notice mine
Roller ball spikes I’m Pokemon
Paris shit, Louboutin
Under bright lights where do you belong?

Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin realer everyday
Niggas killin’ niggas, starving 'cause they can’t find no Yay
See at first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trapped and some be dying, bow our heads and let us pray
Amen

Amen, how many people do you know hatin’?
On your downfall sitting their waitin’
When you shine, wonder what they gonna say then
Everything I do now stadiums
Tell me what they really gon’ say to him
And I’m headed straight to the ATM

They say they want that dumb shit, but this is ignorance
Come to warn the timepiece, yeah now that's ignorance
They like, Young you a fool, yeah I coulda bought some real estate
Instead I bought a half a block, I tried to sew up half the streets
I’m up seventy five on seventy five, when they was going for the twenty five
Guess who’s pickin’ up a trey
Just an ordinary day with extraordinary pay
Extraordinary risk
Can’t even explain, got an extraordinary wrist
I talk it cause I lived it man, this shit ain't really nothin’ to me

I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends

I'm spaced out dog, I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more

Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
Never repeat him, never repeat him

Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true
Like there the god go in his Murcielago
From working McDonalds, barely paying the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom
40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week
Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did strippers not make an arc when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains?
In Jesus' name, let the choir say
""I'm on fire, ay,"" that's what Richard Pryor say
And we'll annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know, they admire 'Ye

Shake that body, party that bod

Come and have a good time with G.O.D

Ya nigga, y'all had my, I had my Jesus piece since ‘94
I don’t know what I, I don’t know what you’re talkin’ bout
And my eagle, still got it all in the bag, B
All you did was play possum
Yo, come on

Six hundred Cuban cigar in the big tub
Medallion on, Dove soap on the fresh cut
With soap suds on the Mac-11
My big lion haven’t ate since twelve
And it’s after seven
We feed the nigga like forty chickens
His tail wag when I send him a bag with just one victim
Uh-huh, now let me show you what my closet on
Gems in the display case, call it a rock-a-thon
I got soccer moms paying for cock
Asians get it from behind while they cleanin’ their wok
Coming with flows that's toxic
Deadly fumes when I'm in the room
Repercussions occur when you try and snitch
Red light, green light
One, two, three
Look mean, got my machine
Cried and hit you, please
Say shake that body, scar up that body
Should I kill him now Ton'? I said probably
Side bets, I form better
Bust hammers with pot holders
And yo, dead a cow for his fuckin' leather
I’m not bow-legged but old school like red fox
My favorite colour in my hustle days was red tops
My gold eagle arm shitted out a red rock
Threw it off my project roof, saw red dots
Kanye, shine a light on my Wallabees
You can have a good time with G.O.D

Shake that body, party that bod (That's rare nigga!)
Shake that body, party that bod (Rick Flare nigga!)
Shake that body, party that body (Yeah nigga!)
Come and have a good time with G.O.D (yeah)

Shake that body, party that bod (Whoa!)
Shake that body, party that bod (Whoa!)

Eagerness to live life and see the bright lights
To sacrifices we made it's sorta Christ-like

Everybody got problems baby, algebra class
Remember I used to do things that'd make you laugh
Like orderin' a girl drink in a masculine glass
You like piña coladas, getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But, they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Ain't no denying baby you have changed
Cause now your high heels clicking, your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching, you're pissed off, tripping
Cause even when we're kissing baby girl feel different

No he didn't, is you talking about Kitten?
Is that bitch still stripping?

But she upped and left a nigga and she ain't give me no sign

Seen with some lame, it's a miracle that she'd

So I can't bitch and moan, in a session gettin' stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train, to try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her, ""Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress.""
Thirty foot train, diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides, I'm so glad you came

Wedding in June, what could be better?
Let's fly to Euro, make this the best summer ever

We be all night, love, love

I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keeping me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinking, watermelon
I want your body right here, daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty, daddy, I want you

Kanye West,"Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'
With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain’t knowin' their goals
The streets ain’t safe cause they ain’t knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins in
Yellow and pink and collared blue
Profiles glorifying them

Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right
Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
It’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
It’s steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three stripes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful

Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn’t just fertile, it’s people working and earning this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It’s so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
It’s so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love
Down on the corner",Corners,2013

Niggas shot out my windows, they jealous and envy
They spit on my 'Rari, they keyed up my Bentley

Finna' rob me a nigga who’s money wasn’t the same
Somebody gon' give it to me, or get one up in the brain
Mama used to stroke it just to feed me scraps
Every Saturday, it was YO! MTV raps
Got sick of looking at other niggas that ain't deserve it
So I followed my older brother to beat these traps
I ain't worried about the love, I've seen everything
The hood hot, like the devil had it off in his hands
Send a strap your way, I seen a couple of fans
Last pack, I took that and a couple of bands
If I ain't hustle to eat, I was doing that sippin' Screw
But they would give it to me, everyday I was paying dues
I was a young wild nigga missing a couple screws

Young and I leans with a cup full of lean, and a 4-0 tucked
No more sleep, gotta get more bucks, OG rolled up
Stakes are high, so I pray to God the folks don't roll up
Big sister told me I need to grow up
But I need that money, better not crumb me
Pockets fat as my codeine tummy
Trying to get blow like my nose was runny
I work for mine, you can't take that from me
Wrap it up, like Egyptian mummy
And have it ready when I roll on up
Stacking dough on up, from the floor on up
And I'm all through the hood like ice cream trucks, just rollin'

Kick endo to try and get that dough
Whole family know, so they couldn't stand me
Run and tell your mama, come get your son
Mama like damn, what the hell he done
Brother had bricks, but didn't give me shit
So when he went to the pen, I ain't send him shit

I'm a man of my law, I gotta keep my weight up
But who will lean if I fall? But never mind, I'm fly, you know

She the type to seek love and make it everlasting
I'm the type to wake up and say it never happened
I mean I fucked the girl with hella passion
But it's cold how we smashing
Left her sleeping on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice
Good excuse for my absence like ""Flacko where your ass been?""
Heard you done with fashion, now yo ass is acting
I'm tripping off the acid, now yo ass is looking massive
This ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
Rolling spliffs, clique beside me, fingers Liberace
When I seen this bitch in Venice, Tommy and some mean Huaraches
I'm all alone though, mood music makes me bop slower
Trippin' on how I shifted pop culture
Changed Hip-Hop on ya, smoking like a rasta was my pops culture
I be damned if I die sober
I'll be sure to visit Pac for ya

And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt, or is it too late?
I'm a man of my law, I gotta keep my weight up
But who will lean if I fall? But never mind, I'm fly, you know

Let em see them fuckin' hands
And for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps
Lex, coupes and the Beamers and the Benz, come again
When my death calls, I pray the Lord accept collect calls
Cause I be playing with these womens like they're sex dolls
Call my Prada prior, cause it's dropping next fall
Don't you short the next ball, my closet like the Met ball
She said, ""I just love it when you speak soft-spoken
Up in the magazines with your teeth all golden""
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Dropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'
That touch your soul music, I get you higher, grab your lighter fluid
Might add a preacher and a choir to it
I speak the father's music, hallelujah
Always Strive & Prosper, stupid
Even Montell can't tell you how he do it
Sit back and watch me do it

So tell me now does it hurt, or is it too late?

But who will lean if I fall? But never mind, I'm fly, you know

Okay let's get past all the swag trapping and fashion talking
You want that take it to gats or keep it in rapping talking
They rapping bars it get embarrassed, it actually happens often
You my son like my last abortion, I'm just laughing off it
I changed rap with fashion four way, yeah I'm that important
You jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both acting awkward?
Jiggling baby, nah, go ahead bitch
Ain't nothing better than the pretty big forehead bitch
Listen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familiar
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia
Did Azalea's from Australia, trips to Venezuela
Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather
Ella, ella, ay just play it like I didn't tell ya
Niggas taking pictures any time we get together
And hope to fly away one day just like some love birds
Only one word I'm afraid of is the ""love"" word

More power to you, more power to you my lovely one
What's up bruh? That all depends
With friends like you, who needs friends
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when it's your advice
Man remember
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member
Man everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo
Ay bitch you missed out, hashtag #Fomo

Kanye West,"They used to tell me
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world

All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagine this so much some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress
Starin' at the ceilin' tryna to connect the dots
But its hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know? My - my step brother used to flip them bags outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're getting fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars and be like ain't too much that's different
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up everyday like you on a mission?

I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world

My grandma told me if you write your name in stone you'll never get the white out
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the white house
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from I swear they broke, they need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions that I couldn't survive
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black you had to extra extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise saying

I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world",One Man Can Change the World,2015

Don't let them take over the heart within, no

Sister don't let your guard down
It's 'bout to get hard now
And brother don't let your love go
Support her in the best way you know how
Love on your woman, step by your brother

They don't share the love but they're upto something

I know, I know it, that they're up to something)

So, sister don't let your guard down

It's like you take it for granted
And sometimes something loves you

Kanye West,"You want me to give you a testimony about my life
And how good he's been to me
I don't know what to tell you about him
I love him so much with all my heart
And my soul, with every bone in my body I love him so much
Because he's done so much for me

Every morning, every day of my life
I won't always be crying tears in the middle of the night
And I won't always have to wake up by myself 
Wondering how I'm gonna get through the day
I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do
And how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it
How I'm gonna get there, because he, he's gonna be there for me

Some day the sky above will open up
And he will reach out his hand and guide me through, oh yes he will
I won't always be crying these tears 
I won't always be feeling so blue
Some day, he will open up the door for me and call my name
Some day he will
I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like

No matter what you've been through
Or where you've been he's always there
With his arms open wide accepting me for who I am and I love him so much
I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to
I'm crying now, it feels so good to be free
To be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what

Please baby no more parties in LA, uh
No more parties in LA
Please baby no more parties in LA, uh
No more (Los Angeles)

Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, one thing
I think that pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making them mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good though, the head still good though
Ladies say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical, make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Captain Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with uni fee
And I walk through with ease, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity
And yeah G, I was all for it
She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet
I'mma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy

Scary, scary
No more parties in LA
Please baby, no more parties in LA
Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And a Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir
Any rumor you heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use their kids as meal tickets
Not knowing the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of week content of slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know that L.A. is so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive, need to put up some got damn barricades
I be paranoid every time
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'
The problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played to me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't've popped the Xans
I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans
I'm 38 years old, a 8 year old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the road so I ain't never drivin'
It took 6 months to take the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed as soon as they backed it out
Got damn, got up of fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-drop-drop-drop it like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money, money, money, money
Big, big money, money, money, money
And as far as real friends tell my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker

Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost

The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself 
And I love myself way more than I love you, so
Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always beside the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say, ""Don't say this, don't say that""
Just say out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself, and I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always beside the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say something good 
To compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was trying to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself 
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright it's no sun, get so loud I hear none
Screamed so loud got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prrt-pum-pum-pum
Set the Newtone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say, ""He died so young""

Like a gang truce, the first Blood to shake the Crip's hand
I know everybody emotional
Is it better if I rap about crack? Huh? 'Cause it's cultural?
Or how about I'ma shoot you, or fuck your bitch?
Or how about all this Gucci, 'cause I'm fuckin' rich?

Ya know nothin' about lettin' a few strays go off
Ya only reach for your hip when your two ways go off
Shots'll fly by your head
Your toup blow off
I ain't crip I'm just a blue gray show off
Ghetto fab I more than rap for my bucks
Keep two 9's on me like Warren Sapp from the Buccs
The word I'm ballin' be flowin' to the fed Jakes
And I keep chicks on my lap throwin' me head fakes
Nigga I walk around with the grams you stackin'
And me and Flex don't roll unless they Andrew Jackson

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose

And my heartbeat is a symphony the

Closer I get to you
I never saw you comin' till you
Came and here you are
I never thought someone

Would ever dare
To come this far
You're up for the resistance
And I'm strong in my persistence

And I've never known
A remedy like ours
If I can't have you
If I can't have you

I would be a river dried up
Into dust
I would be imprisoned
For ever having loved

If I can't have you
I don't wanna be me
Then I would be the same man
You scraped off the ground

I'd have to go back bein'
That broken soul you found
Those days are in the darkness
I buried them with hardness

And I'd have to dig those
Demons out
Your life is like anchor that puts
Me in my place

No you won't let me sink when
I'm off losin' my way
Thank God for your virtue
And the wisdom in your eye

Cause somehow you
Get through on
All that crazy in my mind
If I can't have you

If I can't have you
I would be a river
Dried up into dust
I would be imprisoned for never

Having loved
If I can't have you
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be me

Why did it take you so long to
Finally see
That we had love
That you don't find easily

You broke my heart and the price
To pay for that
Is you'll have to live the misery of
Losing what you had

If I can't have you
My words have come to late
I've already turned that page
Don't you look at me back and

That's the part I hate
I'll stay trapped inside my hell
Where it's so hot
That my walls melt

And I can hear a promise
In every lie you said
You'd never tell
If I had only told the truth

Oh I could never trust you to
You'll survive
No I will die
If I can't have you

If I can't have you
Then I'm sorry for the things I
Cost you in the end
My punishment is more than any

Man can stand
I need you in my life
I can't let go
Why don't you stay with me

Tonight
I feel alone
Turn off all the lights
Take me home
If I can't have you

If I can't have you
Then I would be a river
Dried up into dust
I would be imprisoned

For ever having loved
If I can't have you
I don't wanna be me

I can feel the thought in your sigh
Your knuckles are bruised from a losing flight
One way down a dead end street
Broken glass underneath your feet

Felt the wind raging at my door

Kara Lindsay,"""Write what you know""
So they say, all I know is I don't know what to write
Or the right way to write it
This is big, lady, don't screw it up
This is not some little vaudeville I'm reviewing

Poor little kids versus rich greedy sour pusses
Ha, It's a cinch
It could practically write itself
And let's pray it does, cause as I may have mentioned
I have no clue what I'm doing

Am I insane? This is what I've been waiting for
Well that, plus the screaming of ten angry editors
A girl? It's a girl, how the hell? Is that even legal?
Look, just go and get her

Not only that, there's a story behind the story:
Thousands of children, exploited, invisible
Speak up, take a stand, and there's someone to write about it
That's how things get better

Give life's little guys some ink, and when it dries just watch what happens
Those kids will live and breathe right on the page
And once they're center stage, you watch what happens
And who's there with her camera and her pen
As boys turn into men
They'll storm the gates and then just watch what happens when they do

Picture a handsome, heroically charismatic
Plain spoken, know nothing, skirt-chasing, cocky little son of a-
Lie down with dogs and you wake up with a raise and a promotion

So, he's a flirt
A complete ego maniac
The fact is he's also the face of the strike
What a face
Face the facts, that's a face that could save us all from sinking in the ocean

Like someone said, ""Power tends to corrupt""
And absolute power, wait, wait, corrupts?
Absolutely, that is genius
But give me some time, I'll be twice as good as that six months from never

Just look around at the world we're inheriting
And think of the one we'll create
Their mistake is they got old, that is not a mistake we'll be making
No sir, we'll stay young forever

Give those kids and me the brand new century and watch what happens
It's David and Goliath, do or die
The fight is on and I can't watch what happens

But all I know is nothing happens if you just give in
It can't be any worse than how it's been
And it just so happens that we just might win
So whatever happens, let's begin",Watch What Happens,1992

We'll be what?

We're already winning

Right

And we'll tell them straight out
They let Crutchie go or they keep getting pounded

Karan Casey,"In the morning we built the city
In the afternoon walked through its streets
Evening saw us leaving
We wandered through our days as if they would never end
All of us imagined we had endless time to spend
We hardly saw the crossroads and small attention gave
To the landmarks on the journey from the cradle to the grave
Cradle to the grave, cradle to the grave

Did you learn to dream in the morning?
Abandon dreams in the afternoon?
Wait without a hope in the evening?
Did you stand there in the traces and let them feed you lies?
Did you trail along behind them wearing blinkers on your eyes?
Did you kiss the foot that kicked you? Did you thank them for their scorn?
Did you ask for their forgiveness for the act of being born?
Act of being born, act of being born

Did you alter the face of the city?
Make any change in the world you found?
Or did you observe all the warning?
Did you read the trespass notice? Did you keep off the grass?
Did you shuffle off the pavement just to let your betters pass?
Did you learn to keep your mouth shut? Were you seen and never heard?
Did you learn to be obedient and jump to at a word?
Jump to at a word, jump to at a word

And did you ever demand any answer?
The who and the what and the reason why
And did you ever question the setup?
And did you stand aside and let them choose while you took second best?
Did you let them skin the cream off and then give to you the rest?
Did you settle for the shoddy? And did you think it right
To let them rob you right and left and never make a fight?
And never make a fight, never make a fight

What did you learn in the morning?
How much did you know in the afternoon?
Were you content in the evening?
And did they teach you how to question when you were at the school?
Did the factory help you grow? Were you the maker or the tool?
Did the place where you were living enrich your life and then?
Did you mix among the standing of all your fellow men?
All your fellow men, all your fellow men, all your fellow men",Ballad of Accounting,1997
Karan Casey,"She's like the swallow that flies on high
She's like the river that never runs dry
She's like the sun beaming on the lea shore
I love my love, but love is no more

A maiden into her garden did go
For to pluck her some wild primrose
The more she plucked, the more she did pull
Until this maiden's apron was full

Then out of these roses she made a bed
A scarlet pillow for her head
She laid her down, no words she did speak
And then this maiden's heart, it did break

She's like the swallow that flies on high
She's like the river that never runs dry
She's like the sun beaming on the lea shore
I love my love, but love is no more",She Is Like the Swallow,1997

The thing they fear most is
That I might want to stay
By their side on a distant shore

What I cannot escape is

Far away on a distant shore

Is just to know you more
To live a life that moves and breathes
And loves to bring you joy
So fill me with a fire
That burns away my doubts and all my fears
Into a place where you are all I hear
It's the one thing I desire
To do what you require
Is the one thing I desire

To love when I'd rather turn away
To give when I'm more resigned to take
To reach out a hand to someone who 
Feels alone
The way you reached for me
When there seemed to be no hope

On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year

She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own

Got a head-on collision

I don't give a damn

Rich man want to be king

I won't even wish for snow

Underneath the mistletoe

To the North Pole for Saint Nick

Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you (you, baby)

Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

I caught her painting the bedroom blue

Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free

And feelin' good was good enough for me

To the California sun

Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done

Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me & Bobby McGee [Instrumental],2004

First kiss and I knew you changed the game
