Jars of Clay,"January One
I got a lot of things on my mind
I'm looking at my body
Through a new spy satellite

I try to lift a finger
But I don't think I can make the call
So tell me if I move
'Cause I don't feel anything at all

So carry me
I'm just a dead man
Lying on the carpet
Can't find a heartbeat

Make me breathe
I wanna be a new man
Tired of the old one
Out with the old plan

I woke up from a dream
About an empty funeral
But it's better than the party
Full of people I don't really know

Well, they've got hearts to break and burn
Dirty hands to feel the earth
There's something in my veins
But I can't seem to make it work
It won't work

So carry me
I'm just a dead man
Lying on the carpet
Can't find a heartbeat

Make me breathe
I wanna be a new man
Tired of the old one
Out with the old plan

Can you find a beat inside of me?
Any pulse, getting worse
Any pulse, getting worse
Inside of me, can you find a beat?

Carry me
I'm just a dead man
Lying on the carpet
Can't find a heartbeat

Make me breathe
I wanna be a new man
Tired of the old one
Out with the old plan

Carry me
I'm just a dead man
Lying on the carpet
Can't find a heartbeat

Make me breathe
I wanna be a new man
Tired of the old one
Out with the old plan
",Dead Man (Carry Me),2006
Jars of Clay,"I whisper,""You don't have to worry, we'll survive""
Forced smiles underneath the brittle, frozen light
No proof that you're alive
Cold fingers find the curve below your tired eyes
No comfort in familiar places, not this time
You hold it deep inside

Oh sister, if you wake up in the night
Walls are falling, letting in the light
No need to worry
Baby, even angels cry

No flood warnings, still the waters rise
Flowers through asphalt, Diamonds in the pockets of your eyes
Turn your face and hide
I saw a woman with ribbons in her hair
Old and lonely, so beautiful I had to stop and stare
The well will not run dry

Oh sister, if you wake up in the night
Walls are falling, letting in the light
No need to worry
Baby, even angels cry

Oh sister, if you wake up in the night
Walls are falling, letting in the light
No need to worry
Baby, even angels cry

Cry Sister, if you wake up in the night
Walls are falling, letting in the light
It'll be alright
Baby, even angels cry

Baby, please don't worry
Not tonight

",Even Angels Cry,2006
Jars of Clay,"All the good monsters open their eyes
To see the wasteland where the home fires rise
And the people shouting, ""Why, why, why""

Do you know what you are?
Do you know what you are?

All the giants wake from their sleep
And roll outside of safety's keep
And the pain makes them feel so alive

Do you know what you are; do you know what you are?
We are bored of all the things we know
Do you know what you are; do you know what you are?

Not all monsters are bad
But the ones who are good
Never do what they could, never do what they could

All the good monsters rattle their chains
And dance around the open flames
They make a lot of empty noise

While all of the bright eyes turn away
As if there wasn't anything to say
About the justice and the mystery

Do you know what you are?
Do you know what you are?
We are bored of all the things that we know
And we are forms of everything we love, we love..

If good won't show its ugly face,
Evil won't you take your place?
Nothing ever changes, nothing ever changes
By itself

We are bored of all the things that we know
Do you know what you are?
Because we are so in love with ourselves

We are forms of all the things we love.

",Good Monsters,2006
Jars of Clay,"Catch the rain, empty hands
Save the children from their lands
Wash the darkness from their skin
Heroes from the West
We don't know you, we know best
But this is not a test

You treat me like I'm blind
Setting fires around houses on the hill
But light gives heat
You segregate my mind
Burning crosses from your fears
But light gives heat

It's not the way to light their way
Boys in holes and empty fields
Oh, how good it feels
Lower class and understate
Empty promise, empty plate

You treat me like I'm blind
Setting fires around houses on the hill
But light gives heat
You segregate my mind
Burning crosses from your fears, your fears
But light gives heat, gives heat

You treat me like I'm blind
Setting fires around houses on the hill
But light gives heat
You segregate my mind
Burning crosses from your fears, oh, no
But light gives heat

Will you teach us how to love?
To see the things you see
Walk the road you walk
Feel the pain that you feel

At your feet, I kneel
I want to see you shine
See your light not mine
'Cause light gives heat
Your light gives heat
",Light Gives Heat,2006
Jars of Clay,"I'm feeling older than my years
I'm feeling pain inside my chest
It's love that keeps me silent
It's my silence that you detest
Rivers flow into the oceans
And oceans never fill
I want to kiss your lips, but I know I never will

Love's a hard decision to risk impending choke
But love will keep you wishing
And my heart will keep me broke

I blew flowers, gave you candy to even out the guilt
I sent you greeting cards with messages that I could never write
Rivers flow into the oceans
And oceans never fill
I want to let you know me
But I know I never will

Love's a contradiction
Many mirrors and smoke
Love will keep you wishing
My heart will keep me broke

You will always want me
And I'll always want to leave
Even though I cut your wounds
You still deny they're real
Rivers flow into the ocean
Oceans never fill
I want to lay my life down
But I know you never will

Love's a strange condition
With all the doubts it can invoke
You love keeps me wishing
And my heart keeps me broke

Baby, don't you cry, 'cause I got it all figured out
You always make me sad
But that's what true love is all about
Rivers never fill the oceans
But oceans always feel
The waters reaching deep inside them
I guess they always will

Love's a constant mission to a world you never spoke
Love, it keeps you wishing
My heart, it keeps me broke...

Mirrors and Smoke

",Mirrors & Smoke,2006
Jars of Clay,"Oh, my God, look around this place
Your fingers reach around the bone
You set the break and set the tone
Flights of grace and future falls
In present pain, all fools say, ""Oh, my God""

Oh, my God, why are we so afraid?
We make it worse when we don't bleed
There is no cure for our disease
Turn a phrase and rise again
Or fake your death and only tell
Your closest friends, oh, my God

Oh, my God, can I complain?
You take away my firm belief
And graft my soul upon your grief
Weddings, boats and alibis
All drift away and a mother cries

Liars and fools, sons and failures
Thieves will always say
Lost and found, ailing wanderers
Healers always say

Whores and angels, men with problems
Leavers always say
Broken hearted, separated
Orphans always say

War creators, racial haters
Preachers always say
Distant fathers, fallen warriors
Givers always say

Pilgrim saints, lonely widows
Users always say
Fearful mothers, watchful doubters
Saviors always say

Sometimes I can not forgive
These days mercy cuts so deep
If the world was how it should be
Maybe I could get some sleep

While I lay, I'd dream we're better
Scales were gone and faces lighter
When we wake, we hate our brother
We still move to hurt each other

Sometimes I can close my eyes
And all the fear that keeps me silent
Falls below my heavy breathing
What makes me so badly bent?

We all have a chance to murder
We all have the need for wonder
We still want to be reminded
That the pain is worth the plunder

Sometimes when I lose my grip
I wonder what to make of Heaven
All the times I thought to reach up
All the times I had to give up

Babies underneath their beds
Hospitals that cannot treat them
All the wounds that money causes
All the comforts of cathedrals

All the cries of thirsty children
This is our inheritance
All the rage of watching mothers
This is our greatest offense

Oh, my God
Oh, my God
Oh, my God
",Oh My God,2006
Jars of Clay,"Shoot a dream in your arm
And sleep away
It's not the stuff that kills you
That keeps your life at bay

Every crash pulls you in reach
Of a watershed of signal flares
That cover your beach

These are just placebos
To make us feel all right
Illusions in our pockets
Make our feathers float us high

For a second I thought I saw
Your eyelids rise
A moment something restless
Caught you by surprise
Surprise, surprise

We are so beautiful
When we sleep
Hearts of gold and eyes
So deep, deep, deep

But love won't cure the chaos
And hope won't hide the loss
And peace is not the heroine
That shouts above the cause

And love is wild for reasons
And hope though short in sight
Might be the only thing
That wakes you by surprise
Surprise, surprise

And dream, little ones
See the world just begun

And love is wild for reasons
And hope though short in sight
Might be the only thing
That wakes you by surprise

For a moment I thought I saw
Your eyelids rise
Surprise, surprise
",Surprise,2006
Jars of Clay,"It took a lot to turn away,
Blood and water from one side.
It took your eyes to stare me down,
It took the truth to set me free, to set me free.

Lookin' for a place to hide, waitin' for the wind to rise,
My soul is waiting,
Lookin' for a place to hide, I need a little peace tonight.

Take me higher than the sun, yeah you are the only one
Take me higher than the sun, yeah, yeah.

Around the ceiling of the heart,
Is where we find the things that send us away,
To where the blind can see the stars.
So do you see the stars, do you see the stars?

Looking for a place to hide,
Need a little peace tonight.

Jars of Clay,"There is a river that washes you clean
There is a tree that marks the places you've been
Blood that was spilled, although not your own...

For all of your tears
Are the wages for things you have done
On all of those nights, spent alone in the darkness of your mind
Give it up, let go. These are things you were never meant to shoulder

There is a river that washes you clean
There is a tree that marks the places you've been
Blood that was spilled, although not your own
For all of your tears, love will atone

So, give up the right, to control the waves that empty at your life
Above wild skies, are the rays that break the shadows we design

Give it up, let go. These are things you were never meant to shoulder
Give it up, let go...

There is a river that washes you clean
There is a tree that marks the places you've been
Blood that was spilled, although not your own
For all of these things, love will atone

I know the world can turn in different ways
Most of the time we're simply hangin' on
But under the signs of how we all behave
We might find the place where we belong...

There is a river that washes you clean
There is a tree that marks the places you've been
Blood that was spilled, although not your own
For all of these things, love will atone
For all of those nights, you cried all alone
For all of your tears...love will atone",There Is a River,2006
Jars of Clay,"I do not love you the way I did when we met.
There are secrets and arguments I haven't finished yet.
But it's only that grace has outlived our regret that we're still here.

So maybe we can stay, till the last drop of water flows under the bridge,
We can stay, till the last drop of water flows under the bridge.

There are times meant for breaking, and words to ignore,
And a bent to our souls when our skin is at war.
And if leaving were freedom, well, we'd both walk right out of that door.

Maybe we can stay, till the last drop of water flows under the bridge,
We can stay, till the last drop of water flows.

And the years roll by, and you hold my hand, while the shadows stretch over the land.
Crumble and fall in my arms, and we'll struggle to hold on.
Waters they rise and they carry our hopes and dreams away, baby we can stay, stay.

And the years roll by, and you hold my hand, while the shadows stretch over the land.

Maybe we can stay, till the last drop of water flows under the bridge, 
We can stay, till the last drop of water flows under the bridge,
We can stay till the last drop of water flows under the bridge.",Water Under the Bridge,2006
Jars of Clay,"Just in case
I will leave my things packed
So I can run away
I cannot trust these voices
I don't have a line of prospects
That can give some kind of peace
There is nothing left to cling to
That can bring me sweet release
I have no fear of drowning
It's the breathing
That's taking all this work
Do you know what I mean
When I say I don't wanna be alone?
What I mean when I say
I don't wanna be alone?
Empty spaces
Shadows hit by streetlights
With warning signs and weight
Of tired conversations
In the absence of a shoulder
In the abscess of a thief
On the brink of this destruction
On the eve of bittersweet
Now all the demons look like prophets
And I'm living out
Every word they speak
Every word they speak
Do you know what I mean
When I say I don't wanna be alone?
What I mean when I say
I don't wanna be alone?
What I mean when I say
I don't wanna be alone?
Do you know what I mean
When I say I don't wanna be alone?
What I mean when I say

You walked right through it

Not much grace left on a broken wing
I feel the wind trying to push me down
It happens every time I get to town

I search for shelter near the mines we swept
I guess forgiveness hasn?t happened yet
There are no words that I can say to you
That turn this careless sky from black to blue?

So I?m asking you is it safe? Is it safe to land?
?Cause I?m not going far on an empty heart
Is it safe? Is it safe to land? 
'Cause the long fall back to earth is the hardest part...

I?m in no weather for apologies
I need your runway lights to burn for me
And if you say that I can come around
I?ll love you right, yeah I won?t let you down
I won?t let you down

?Cuz I?m coming home, if these wheels touch down
I?m coming home I?m waking you up 
In the middle of the night I?m not giving up
I?m gonna stay ?til we make it work
We?re not going down even if it gets worse
We?ll work it out. Yeah we?ll work it out
I need your light, guide me in
Is it safe?

I?ve been splitting hairs and blurring lines 
I am a house that is divided 
In my heart and in my mind 

I use one hand to pull closer 
The other to push you away 
If I had two hands doing the same thing 
Lifted high, lifted high 

I have a broken disposition 
I?m a liar who thirsts for the truth 
And while I ache for faith to hold me 
I need to feel the scars and see the proof 

And if we just keep digging we can reach the foundation 
Of our souls 
And if we just keep cutting all the chains from our hearts 
We?ll lose control 

And it feels like giving in 
It feels like starting over 
It feels like waking up, and you know it?s coming 
It feels like a brand new day

No man is an island
Come on home to me

Just follow your desire
Leave it all
You're leaving all
Just burn it in the fire

Everything you once knew
Everyone that knew you
Remove the shoes you came on
Feel the earth you're made from
Pack up all your questions
Just keep heading inland
Come on home to me
Yeah come on home to me

Woah oh oh-oh-oh
Woah oh oh-oh-oh
You keep walking inland
No man is an island
Come on home to me

You fill the sky with burning arrows from your heart 
Throw your bottles out to sea and watch them float away 

Tell me of the world you’re leaving 
While you’re swinging like a wrecking ball 
You bury all your love in secrets 
And loneliness in alcohol 

Hide your diamonds in the dirt in careful rows 
Let your doubt unravel all their, all their pretty bows 
‘Cause your heart is broken by the things you love 
And your light, it carries but it’s not enough to change the weather 

Tell me of the world you’re leaving 
While you’re swinging like a wrecking ball 
Bury all your love in secrets 
And loneliness in alcohol 

You get buried under all these lines, all this light, all these lies

Jars of Clay,"Lesson one - do not hide
Lesson two - there are right ways to fight
And if you have questions
We can talk through the night

So you know who you are
And you know what you want
I've been where you're going
And it's not that far
It's too far to walk
But you don't have to run
You'll get there in time

Lesson three - you're not alone
Not since I saw you start breathing on your own
You can leave, you can run, this
Will still be your home

So you know who you are
And you know what you want
I've been where you're going
And it's not that far
It's too far to walk
But you don't have to run
You'll get there in time
Get there in time

In time, to wonder where the days have gone
In time, to be old enough to
Wish that you were young
When good things are unraveling,
Bad things come undone
You weather love and lose your innocence

There will be liars and
Thieves who take from you
Not to undermine the consequence
But you are not what you do
And when you need it most
I have a hundred reasons why I love you

If you weather love and lose your innocence
Just remember - lesson one

Jas,"The weeks slip through our fingers like the dry sand blowing across the dunes,
Swept into a cardboard box filled with forgotten photographs
And abandoned songs.
The past few years are illuminated only by the dim glow
Of a sun setting in the east
It's almost night.
I scour the landscape trying to make out your familiar shape against the horizon.
But it's amazing how rarely our paths cross considering we share the same bed.
The sand stings my face and I keep walking, keep looking.
And I can barely make out the sound of my own voice beneath the wind:
Maybe we'll be alone.",Prelude,2003
Jas,"Well you're magic he said,
But don't let it all go to your head,
Well I bet if you all had it all figured out
Then you'd never get out of bed

no doubt
All the thing's that I've read what he told me
Is now sounding like the man I was hoping 
To be,
Keep on keeping it real
Cause it keeps getting easier indeed

he's the reason why I'm laughing, 
Even when there's no one else,
He said, you've got to love yourself

you say, you shouldn't mumble when you speak
But keep your tongue up in your cheek,
And if you stumble on to bed
Remember that it's humble that you seek

you got all the skill you need,
Individuality,
You got something
Call it gumption 
Call it anything you want

because only you play the fool now,
You're only fooling everyone else, 
You're learning to love yourself,
Yes you are

there's no price to pay
When you give what you take,
That's why it's easy to thank you,
You, you, you...

let's say take a break from the day
And get back to the old garage,
Because life's to short anyway
But at least it's better then average

as long as you got me
And I got you,
You know we'll have a lot to go around,
I'll be your friend, 
Your other brother,
Another love to come and comfort you

and I'll keep reminding,
If it's the only thing I ever do,
I will always love you,
Yes you, you, you...",Thank You,2003

Baby it's cold outside
I've got to go 'way
It's bone chilling cold outside
This evening has been
I've been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
Give me your hands they're just like ice.

My mother will start to worry
Hey babe, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
Well maybe just a half a drink more
Put some music on while I pour.

The neighbors might think
Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink
There's no cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat your hair looks swell.

I oughta say no no no sir
Mind if I move a bit closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride
I really can't stay
Oh baby don't hold out
Oh, but it's cold outside

I simply must go
It's freezing outside
The answer is no
Come over here and let me deep frost ya
The welcome has been
Lucky thing that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm.

My sister will be suspicious
Your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
I'm not worrying about your brother
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh your lips really are delicious
Well maybe just a cigarette more
Oh it's smoking plenty up in here

I've got to get home
Baby you'd freeze out there
Say lend me a comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I love when you touch my hand
Oh, but don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my lifelong sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
What if you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Oh come on girl
Baby it's cold outside
Baby it's cold outside

Oh I nailed that
That's good babe
Where were you going anyway?
I mean, we're married
I got things to do
Slide over here baby.

Let me tell you, you're smoking

Jasko,"Fünf Jahre ist es her, ich wünscht’, es wär’ passé
Als wir uns kennenlernten, damals im Café
Und seitdem haben wir Tage und Nächte verbracht
Aber du hast in mir neue Ängste entfacht
Du bist so kalt, du hast Ecken und Kanten
Und nur wegen dir vergaß ich all die restlichen Schlampen
Nein, ich will nicht mit dir, doch ich kann nicht ohne dich
Weil du wie ’ne Droge bist, bitte Gott, verschone mich
Du verfolgst mich - ich gehe fort
Ganz egal, wo ich bin, du bist fast an jedem Ort
Stehst allein in deiner Ecke und du schaust mich an
Und flüsterst in mein Ohr: „Los Baby, trau dich ran!“
Du verführst mich jedes Mal mit deiner Anziehungskraft
Du bist magic und machst einen Mann wie mich schwach
Das Problem ist: du machst es mit jedem
Und du lässt mir keine Wahl, damit kann ich nicht leben
Nein, viel zu lange stand ich hier an deiner Seite
Nur wegen dir war ich ein paar Mal pleite
Du spielst mit mir, ziehst mir die Kohle aus der Tasche
Doch ich kann dich nicht lieben, ohne dich zu hassen
Ich hasse mich dafür, denn ich bin süchtig nach dir
Oft wird es mir zu viel und dann flücht’ ich vor dir
Und danach hab’ ich jedes Mal ein schlechtes Gewissen
Nur wegen dir hab’ ich meine Eltern beschissen
Nur wegen dir hatt’ ich so viel’ schlaflose Nächte
Nur wegen dir beginnt wieder ein Tag ohne Texte
Nur wegen dir komm ich aus den Fesseln nicht raus
Aber manchmal schickst du mich mit ’nem Lächeln nach Haus
Damit ich länger bei dir bleib’, zeigst du mir schöne Bilder
Mit dir gibt es keine Zukunft und vor allem keine Kinder
Keiner gönnt mir was, alle machen Auge auf dich
Öfter seh’ ich rot und dann verhaue ich dich
Keine schluckt so wie du du bist charismatisch
Ich muss dich nicht berühren, es läuft automatisch
Ich will an die Spitze und mir alles krallen
Aber kurz vor dem Ziel lässt du mich wieder fallen
Du hörst mir zu von den Problemen, die frustrieren
Doch du bist gefühlslos und redest nicht mit mir
Ich verlor alles, denn ich wollte immer mehr
Ohne dich wär’ ich schon längst Millionär

„Das waren meine letzten Worte für dich
Ab jetzt müssen wir getrennte Wege gehen, mein Schatz
Denn wenn ich mit dir bleibe, treibst du mich in den Ruin
Ab jetzt, wenn wir uns begegnen, schau mich nicht an, ignorier mich! 
Denn dasselbe werde ich tun. Und ich wünsch’ dir noch alles Gute.“",Wegen Dir,2016

Mit Gewichten, die sonst nur ein Gabelstapler hebt
Auf der Straße hab ich fame, ich mach' G-Rap mit Flow
Für ein' Rear Naked Choke ist mein Bizeps zu groß
Ah, ich mach' der Sängerin Ciara Kids
Und danach fick ich eine Bitch, und zwar Sierra Kidds
Kurz darauf hat die Bitch in ihrem Hintern Penis drin
Und ich 'ne Anzeige - Verführung von Minderjährigen
Bin im Zerlegen King und geh' ich scheißen in 'nem Zug
Bringt es mir mehr als eine Seite in der JUICE
Und warum sich die Kugeln in deiner Brust befinden

Doch Hunde, die bellen, werden am meisten gefürchtet

2 Milionen Euro, mein Jahresrückblick

Asphalt Massaka, die Trilogie, ich steche dir in deine Givenchy
Ich hab gehört, dass du in Wien auf krass Kanake da machst
Aber in Deutschland bleibst du 'ne Fliege, wie'n Krawattenersatz
Alles Fotzen, außer KC Danke für die Props
Und diese Aussage, doch ihr bleibt Fotzen, ohne Ausnahme
Die Fans haben es gemerkt, dass ihr Heuchler seid
Ihr habt null Loyalität in eurem Freundeskreis
Ihr zeigt euch gegenseitig an und so'n Scheiß
Also irgendwie müsst ihr doch charakterlos sein
Banger-Bro, jeder meiner Crew ist krasser
Die Rebell-Lounge wischt sich mit der JUICE den Arsch ab
Hip-Hop-Medien supporten sanftere Kerle

Packe die Langhantelstange, habe die Kur in mir drin
Und klatsche deine gesamte Bande im Uhrzeigersinn
Dieser MOK klaut wieder Chips liegt auf der Couch und er frisst
Weil sein Bauch fetter ist als der Mount Everest
Merk' dir, dass dich das Label mit dem Boxhandschuh killt
Er ist so fett, dass ihn nicht einmal die Bosst-TraFo hilft

Jasmin Lopez,"Y'a pas que les têtes qu'on piétinent, y'a l'accelerateur 
Je fais mon p'tit rapport pendant que je passe les rapports 
Craignant une fouille des porcs armés sans avoir le port 
Je plane entre la parano, le succès et la mort 
Jamais au point mort, je suis grillé comme le feu rouge 
Le regard farouche, Vitry m'a marqué au fer rouge 
J'rôde dans ma ville, ma vie qui défile dans le pare-brise 
Mon écran, trop vrai pour en faire un film 
Qui suis-je? Un banlieusard parmi des millions 
Un p'tit blédard moderne qui approuve la loi du tallion 
Les golden boys nous les taillons 
A base de golden nous les ravitaillons 
Trop narcissique pour intégrer le bataillon 
Stricte est la street frère, comme ma parole et les peines de prison 
Partagé entre fils et darrone 
Gène d'être reconnu par ma commune dans le bus 
Le hardcore ressort du décor dans une voiture de luxe 

J'écris des textes depuis l'âge de treize piges 
Vivre de sa passion de nos jours c'est un prestige 
Je remercie infiniment mon public intime 
La télécharge c'est le recensement des pinces et des radines 
Dur de faire un disque platine 
Je patine avec une maison de disques qui veut que ses artistes tapinent 
Ne clippe pas les singles en faisant les mesquines 
Passe du rock au rap, je sais même pas si c'était pas des skins 
Sans ROHFF y'a rien d'hostile 
Dans leurs vieilles compiles 
Rappeuse si t'es docile 
J'pête dans leurs vieilles combines 
Fini de donner de la confiture aux cochons 
Chaque rime devrait se vendre dans un pochton 
Je crache pas dans la soupe mais dans la cuillère 
Leur catalogue c'est du gruyère 
Reprend ton souffle c'est que les préliminaires 
Mon son est le meilleur compagnon de la misère 
Si t'es dans l'obscurité dis mon nom ça te feras de la lumière 

Ma musique s'épanouit partout où les gens souffrent 
Prononce mon nom et t'as dit un truc de ouf ! 
Pour serrer des bonnes touffes à la pelle 
Genre tu me connais, devant elles tu m'appelles 
Ne m'interpelle pas dans un centre commercial 
Vlà les cris hystériques ! Ca fait zizir mais des fois ça me fatigue 
Je suis pas toujours d'humeur 
A me faire aborder par un délinquant bourré au Code de l'Honneur 
C'est la rage qui dégueule 
Mentalité de thug 
Nique l'Etat qui fait du bénef sur la misère du peuple 
Y'a que dans les clips que le ghetto roule en Lamborghini 
Le ghetto deale, braque pour des questions de survie 
Le même train de vie que le RER 
Mon son tourne plus que les joints 
J'ai plus de voix que le maire 
Une pensée pour la classe ouvrière 
Malgré l'abolition de l'esclavage 
Ils se tuent au tatouage 
Pendant que je me tue à passer le message",Dis Mon Nom,2006

Now here's a little story I got to tell
About a gangsta-ass bitch, y'all know so well
It started way back, in history
With Lil' Kim, Junior M.A.F.I.A., and B.I.G.

Go Kim! Go Kim! (hold it, hold it now)
Go Kim! Go Kim! (hold it, hold it now)
Go Kim! Go Kim! (hold it, hold it now)
Go Kim! ... WHOAHHHH!

[Lil' Kim]
Now here's a little story I gots to tell
Bout the first rap bitch to rock Chanelle
Tought you how to get money and pop Cristal
Even gave y'all tips on ridin cock as well
The Beehive, sticker say ""better beware""
If it's buzzin in the spot you know my boys is here (bzzzz)
Cause we in the parkin lot, you know the toys is there
Pushin drop Bee wagons, two doors, ya hear?
Hold it now, the Queen's sittin in the chair
Now y'all wanna dress sexy and dye your hair?
Will the real Kim stand up? It's frauds in here
I'm bout to pull the plug on all y'all broads this year
(Lights out!)

[Chorus 2X: Lil' Kim]
When we come to the clubs they be like (hold it, hold it now)
When we pull up on them dubs they be like (hold it, hold it now)
Where my bitches and my thugs gettin right (hold it, hold it now)
Come chill in V.I.P. with us for the night - WHOAHHHH!

[Lil' Kim]
Now all my all my all my bitches rub ya titties (if ya love Biggie)
And all my niggaz grab ya dicks if you feelin a bitch
I'm in the middle of the dancefloor (go Kim, go Kim) killin the shit
With the Belve', tryin not to spill any shit
You know the Queen show love when I'm up in the club
I like to play with my coochie when I'm up in the tub
You a, sensitive thug, lemme give you a hug
Y'all thirsty-ass niggaz take this bottle of bub
I'm the, First Lady, so I can't lose
Because of me y'all rock rhymes in high heel shoes
Lil' Kim the Grammy winner get love worldwide
Now hold that, yo Havoc, let the beat ride

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
And since Frank White taught me how to play the game
La Bella Mafia, nigga I play to reign
They put my album in the street like they pump the 'caine
I'm like bleach - Lil' Kim leave a permanent stain!
I'm feared in my country like Saddam Hussein
I might give a, little head to {""hold it, hold it now""}
All we ask is y'all show respect
Cause we don't want talk, big homey, just cut the check!
Now I'm sittin outside in my 6.6
Just signed a lil' deal bout 6.6
Used to transport bricks and make 6.6
If you look in my garage I got 6 joints

A fish that's learnt to fly I've always been a daughter
But feathers are meant for the sky
So I'm wishing, wishing further
For the excitement to arrive
It's just I'd rather be causing the chaos
Than laying at the sharp end of this knife

With every small disaster I'll let the waters still
Take me away to some place real

'Cause they say home is where your heart is set in stone
Is where you go when you're alone
Is where you go to rest your bones
It's not just where you lay your head
It's not just where you make your bed

And my cuts have healed with time
Comfort will rest on my shoulder
And I'll bury my future behind I'll always keep you with me
You'll be always on my mind

Only know you love her when you let her go

Jasmine Thompson,"Quando la penna mi scivola giù
Disegna forme geometriche random
E mi ritrovo in un posto mai visto
Solo un salto nel vuoto e nient’altro
E gli occhi chiusi che a volte mi mostrano
Forme geometriche troppo complesse
Sarà che a volte serve il buio
Per ridare colore alla mente
Forme geometriche
Tagliano il cielo
Segnano nuovi orizzonti
Grattacieli separano il sole
Le luci al neon sopra i nostri tramonti
Dispositivi che uniscono uomini
Fiumi riempiono le scale mobili
E siamo tutti uguali sempre uguali
Contenitori di emozioni normali

Cause I’m addicted to you

Monotonia contro psichedelia
Quanta bellezza nell’anonimia

Trasformare la passione in un numero
Quanti rancori che uniscono gli uomini

Oh but she burns
Like rum on the fire
Hot and fast and angry
As she can be
I walk my days on a wire

It looks ugly, but it's clean
Oh mamma, don't fuss over me

The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

Calls of guilty thrown at me
All while she stains
The sheets of some other
Thrown at me so powerfully
Just like she throws with the arm of her brother

But I want it, it's a crime
That she's not around most of the time

The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

Her fight and fury is fiery
Oh but she loves
Like sleep to the freezing
Sweet and right and merciful
I'm all but washed
In the tide of her breathing

And the one it, it's divine

And everytime that you make me get the feeling again
And again and again and again and again and again oh

Now I may be naive
But it feels right to me
I'm not looking for love 
But it sneaks up on me
And I promised myself
That I wouldn't give in
But you gave me everything that I need

And I know that I can't hold back
No I won't step back
It's the way I react
To your touch when you're holding me
Taking control of me, oh

Oh, oh, oh
Over and over I tried to find
Reasons for leaving your loving behind
I'm trying my best
No denying the facts
That I can't and I won't
No I can't 
I can't hold back

I can't hold back
No I won't step back
It's the way I react
Yeah
I can't hold back
No I won't step back
It's the way I react
To your loving baby

Jasmine Trias,"I gotta tell you, boy you're what I'm feelin'
I wanna be your girl
That's if you're willing
I love spending time with you
I love all of the things we do 

May seem selfish
Boy I gotta tell you
I hate to see you leave
Don't wanna share you
Won't you be my man?
Boy I don't think you understand

Ooh every time you leave
I'll be missing you, baby
Don't want you to go
Don't want you to go
Don't want you to go

Every time you go away
You take a piece of me
I feel like a child
On the first day of kindergarten
I hate when you go, go

I know you got a life to live
And I got one, too
It's gon take some time for me to get used to
I hate when you go, go, go",Don't Go,2005

Now come sit here and try to pretend
That the love I had for you has come to an end
Seeing you with someone else is gonna make me sick
Cause you're my man
And I'm your girl you're supposed to be with
I'm reminiscing back on the days
Before our little wishes made us go separate ways
You used to plant kisses all over my face
I'm thinking now (?)

Jasmine Watkins,"O holy night! The stars are brightly shining,
    It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth.
    Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
    'Til He appear'd and the soul felt its worth.
    A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
    For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

        Fall on your knees! O hear the angel voices!
        O night divine, O night when Christ was born;
        O night divine, O night, O night Divine.

    Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming,
    With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
    So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,
    Here come the wise men from Orient land.
    The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger;
    In all our trials born to be our friend.

        He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
        Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!
        Behold your King, Before Him lowly bend!

    Truly He taught us to love one another;
    His law is love and His gospel is peace.
    Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother;
    And in His name all oppression shall cease.
    Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
    Let all within us praise His holy name.

        Christ is the Lord! O praise His Name forever,
        His power and glory evermore proclaim.
        His power and glory evermore proclaim.",O Holy Night,2013
Jasmine Yee,"It seems like you're waiting for nothing,
Looks like time had deleted it all,
It may be everything that could have been was thrown away,
So just take what is left, don't somehow fill the space,
When I can see through it, oh I feel safe again,
I feel warmer...

[Chorus]
Sounds of life outside
Why do I retire
Sounds of life outside
One by one...
Got nothing to hideâ?¦
One by one

Couldn't have seen it come, from an inch away,
But it's here, right on time,
Wait for the flash of grey and we will feel the same,
If we can just drift for a while,
When I'm back on the ground I feel safe again,
I feel warmer...

Dusty old travels and forty watt lights.

 Four walls are a prison when your heart's in your head.

How can you look at me as if you still don't see?
 The last time around,
 I'm the final survivor in your heart's ghost town.
 It's the last time around.
Well, I watched the storm engulf you in

You'll never find your hero's death
to ease the pain of always being sane.

I've seen too much of it without you.
So tell me, now, as far as we're concerned,
What would it take to make a place
Where bridges never burn?
We've both seen life come crumbling down.
We've both lost loves that we thought were true.
And now, though fear keeps crowding near our minds,
Inside our hearts it's time to start;
To leave that all behind.
Where bridges never burn.
No more hard lessons to be learned.
Let's take this love that we've both earned,
And go where bridges never burn.
Love don't carry no guarantee,
But we've got everything that we need.

And try to find some peace of mind,

Jason & the Scorchers,"Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

The judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

Chorus
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But late at night, when the north wind blows
In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones

And everybody calls it polk salad, polk salad
Used to know a girl lived down there 
And she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
'Cause thats about all they had to eat, but they did all right

Down in Louisiana, where the alligators grow so mean
There lived a girl, that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame

Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang

And pick her a mess of polk salad, and carry it home in a tow sack

She loved me. 

I think we thought that it would last, but looking back I had to laugh 
What a mess we made of that, now I'm not sure that I would want it back 
We learned a little bit about love, what it wasn't and what it was 
It was fast and it was fun, the beginning of the end of us 

One day that road just ran out, but I still travel down it now and then 
And once againâ?¦

She loved me.

I'm sorry for acting that way
I didn't really mean to make you cry
Oh baby, sometimes I wonder why

Does it always have to come down
To you leaving
Before I'll say ""I love you""
Why do I always use the words
That cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you
Oh baby why, do I do that to you

I know I'd never let you walk away
So why do I push you 'til you break
And why are you always on the verge of good-bye
Before I'll show you how I really feel inside

Does it always have to come down
To you leaving
Before I'll say ""I love you""
Why do I always use the words
That cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you
Oh baby why, do I do that to you

An ash tray full of lucky strikes
A half spent case of warm Bud Lite
Counting regrets, fighting back tears
Retracin' steps, gettin' nowhere

Callin' your name, it's a waste of my breath
There's no reachin' you across this cold and empty bed
Stirrin' up ashes, tryin' to find passion where there's no love left
It's like tryin' to put smoke
Back in this cigarette

Come sunrise, guess I'll check out, and ditch this town
Put a few more miles between us
And keep drivin' till I finally mend my broken trust
Hangin' my hopes on highway signs
If I lie here, I'll lose my mind

Callin' your name, it's a waste of my breath
There's no reachin' you across this cold and empty bed
Stirrin' up ashes, tryin' to find passion where there's no love left

Has the glitter all faded? Do you get what you need?
Are you satisfied, baby, or do you wish it was me?

I know that you did what you thought you should do
It was safe and secure, so completely thought through
But you sacrificed passion, and abandoned your dreams

I found an old yearbook, flipped right to the page of that senior trip
Down there on that Panama strip
We all started yelling when we smelled the beach
Just couldn't wait to try our fake ID's
We only had a few days
And a whole lot of memories to make

Oh man, we were livin'
Didn't waste one minute
We talked, and drank, and danced, and said goodbye
We laughed until we cried

This past year my family
Was sittin' cross-legged 'round the Christmas tree listenin' to granddad
We all knew it'd probably be his last
He was crackin' jokes, and we were takin' turns
Tellin' stories 'bout fishin' or lessons learned
Out on the porch with him
We all felt like kids again

Oh man, we were livin'
Sittin' there reminiscin'
We sang, and talked, and traveled back in time
We laughed until we cried

It's like the best days under the sun
Every emotion rolled into one
A little of this, a little of that
Kinda happy, kinda sad

Just the other night the baby was cryin'
So I got out of bed and rocked her awhile, and I held her tight
And I told her it would be all right
And my mind went back to a few years ago
When we tried so long, we almost gave up hope
And I remember you comin' in and tellin' me the news

Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up
She's a party-all-nighter from South Carolina, a bad mamajama from down in Alabama
She's a raging Cajun, a lunatic from Brunswick, juicy Georgia peach
With a thick southern drawl, sexy swing and walk, brother she's all

Country, (shoot) from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country, from the songs she plays to the prayers she prays,
That's the way she was born and raised, she ain't afraid to stay, country
Brother she's country

A hell raisin sugar when the sun goes down, mama taught her how to rip up a town
Honey dripping honey from the hollering Kentucky,
Get ya flipping kinda trippie like a Mississippi hippie,
She's a Kansas princess, crazy mother trucker, undercover lover
Thick southern drawl, sexy swing and walk,

And left a damn good love behind 
I see her in my rear view like a ghost

Cried when no one else was around 
And prayed that God would save my soul 
Yeah I've paid a lot of heavy tolls

Revin' up at a red light

Passin' mom and pop restaurants
Seein' four trucks parked out front
I guess you gotta make your own fun

There's only two means of salvation around here
That seem to work
Whiskey or the Bible
A shot glass or revival

When you don't seem to run on either side of the fence
People act like you don't make sense
These big town dreams that I've been chasin'
Will never come true if I wind up stayin'
And I don't want to fall in the same rut
That everybody here seems to be stuck in now
Why do I hang around
In this church pew or bar stool kinda town

I'm like that AM station
That never comes in right
'Til you pass the city limit sign
That's the only time it all gets clear

It's crystal clear that I
Just need to find
A place where there is no lines
Nothin' like it is around here

Climbed the water tower in Paris Tennessee

So before you go and fly away girl
Let me show you 'round a country boy's world

Somewhere between there on a dirt road
When I rolled down my window
She smelled wildflowers on the summer wind
Just a bite of home-made ice cream
And a glass of Momma's sweet tea

Or the twinkle of a star in a southern sky

Load the truck up hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls

Jack and Jim were a few good men
When we learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something ya'll don't know

Where we drag raced our pick ups, and Mustangs
And weathered on the summer rain
And to this day up on that overpass,
Even underneath the new paint,
You can still see,
""Allie will you marry me?""

Take a ride, look around
And there ain't no doubt

It sure left it's mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here, with everything we did
We laid a lotta memories down, like tattoo's on this town

There's still a rope burn on that old branch,
That hangs over the river, I still got the scar
From swinging out a little too far
There ain't a corner of this hallowed ground,
That we ain't laughed or cried on, it's where we loved,
Lived and learned a lotta stuff
It's everything we're made of

It sure left it's mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here, with everything we did
We laid a lotta memories down, like tattoo's on this town

Everywhere, it's where we are
It gets me right, in my heart

Was a long drive

Load the truck up hit the dirt road,
Jump the barbwire spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
King in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack and Jim were a few good men
When we learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know

Put my pedal to the metal like I'm racing
Turn it up and let the speakers scream for Mr. Aldean

Wet T-shirts, women in bikinis
Kenny Rogers penny loafers.

Jason Aldean,"She puts on her work clothes, fishnet pantyhose,
She's got a nickname everybody knows at the gentlemen's club
She clocks in at midnight, even though it never feels right,
Makes her money one dollar at a time.
Without the makeup, nobody knows her name,
And she wears the pain

Black tears, rolling down,
From the eyes of an angel in a sinner's town
She reveals, and they all cheer,
Then she cries, black tears

Jealous of the innocent, sometimes she's convinced,
The boss man is still a friend she needs.
She's tried everything, cheap sex and cocaine,
Anything to hide the pain for a little while
The wrong kind of famous in her momma's eyes,
You can tell she knows it when she cries

Black tears, rolling down
From the eyes of an angel in a sinner's town,
White lights on the mirror,
Just won't hide, black tears

She tries and tries so hard to get away
But everybody's watching

Some of that way back when,

Always was the cure, ooh whenever we got bored,
Sideways round the bend, yeah I wanna feel that again.

Where they hit it hard 'til the sun goes down
Nobody really seemed to care
That we were living in the middle of nowhere
We just figured that’s how it was
And everybody else was just like us
Soaking in the rain baking in the sun
Don’t quit 'til the job gets done

That’s the only way I know
Don’t stop 'til everything’s gone
Straight ahead, never turn round
Don’t back up, don’t back down

Dig a little deeper when you think you can’t dig no more

Is you don’t get nothing that you don’t earn
Humble pride that I grew up on
You find out just how bad you want it
Sun in our eyes backs to the fences
We didn’t know the odds were against us
Hit the wall smoking and spinning
Still wasn’t thinking ‘bout nothing but winning

Will get you there a little bit faster,

People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out

Say you, say me

Say you, say me; say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me; say it together
Naturally

As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
A helping hand
Some one who understands
That when you feel you've lost your way
You've got some one there to say ""I'll show you""

Say you, say me; say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me; say it together
Naturally

So you think you know the answers, Oh no
'Couse the whole world has got you dancing
That's right, I'm telling you
It's time to start believing - Oh yes
Believing who you are: You are a shining star

Say you, say me; say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me; say it together
Naturally

Say it together, naturally.","Say You, Say Me",2012

Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man,
We play together in Mother Nature's band

For Tennessee River and his mountain home
But I'm going back, leavin' today, 
Found my homeland so far away

Driving down to dixie, wasting no time,
Back to the good life I left behind,
Going to the River, with my fishing line
Up on Look-out mountain 'bout supper time

Sing it,

Jason Aldean,"When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

I done took all I could take from you
Need a little bit more than a break from you
Matter of fact fuck you, don't need you in my life
You done did so much wrong I hope you get it right
But not at my expense, I did all I could do
You just took me for granted, you thought I was a fool
When I did everything in my power to help and please you
But I don't know you no more, fuck it, I caught amnesia
Too many emotions I try to bury
But the higher I climb, the less weight I'm trying to carry
And niggas holdin' on for dear life, bringin' me drama
But I'm only responsible for my daughters Cai and Karma
Nigga you's a grown man, get yourself together
Forget about the past, now's a better time than never
Matter of fact, it's time to start making better decisions
So put your fires out, and stop burning 'Cris' bridges
You little bitches

When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

Yeah, this industry's full of bullshitters
And all this time you thought you had me fooled niggas
In my Ferrari, partner thought he saw a spaceship
'Cause I move in speed not to get caught up in this fake shit
Smiling in my face when I'm around y'all
But soon as I leave, niggas be prayin' on my down fall
Is it cause you'll never sell as many records?
My bitches always look better, you fail at business endeavors?
Or that people thought you were clever, but now they know you stupid?
And misery loves company now that you're going through it?
Somebody tell these rappers I worked hard in these Louis
So get out of here, you don't want no parts in this shit, do we?
I see them drugs got y'all trippin' too soon
That's why you find me in the club, every once in a blue moon
So while you contemplate making your first million
I'll be somewhere contemplating on making my first billion
And then, trillion

When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

The biggest mistake we make as individuals
Is thinking everyone lives by the same principles
But when I talk by the same teachers or principals
For you to know it's not the money, it's the principle
So I can't expect you to know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Our issues are deep within, we can't just talk 'em out
Niggas is fighting inside, we can't just walk 'em out
These bridges burning so fast, we can't just stomp 'em out
As if you know what I'm talkin' 'bout

When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go",Burning Bridges,2014

I knew that I was finally on my own
So I put my foot down on the gas
To see how fast those wheels could get me going

That born to run on a Friday night
That standing tall small town cry
I took it with me

Kick you right on back where you belong

It was women, it was sinnin’, it was alcohol

When am I, ever gonna learn to walk away
When the chips are down and the cards aint fallin’ my way
Why do I always gotta stay to long till it’s too late

I just spent three nights in a two night town
With a bunch of lost souls just tryna get found
Girl I’ve been a little crazy since you walked out
So I just spent three nights in a two-night town

When am I, ever gonna learn to walk away
When the chips are down and the cards ain't fallin’ my way
Why do I always gotta stay to long till it’s too late
I just spent three nights in a two-night town.

Sun's comin’ up and I’m just goin’ down
But baby this pain is still hangin’ around
I think I’ll spend four nights in a two-night town",Two Night Town,2014

Jason Alexander,"On Monday, I had drinks with Barney Rubble
We hit a couple divvy little bars
We noticed there was quite a lovely lady
Sittin' at the table next to ours

Now Barney, who was pretty friggin' wasted
Got up and stumbled over with a groan
He said, ""Hey, just between us, my Neanderthalic penis
Is as massive as a Stegosaurus bone!”

All cartoons are fuckin' dicks
They get their kicks from being pricks
It's a quirk, we just can't fix
'Cause all cartoons are fuckin' dicks

“Did Barney really say that?”
“Oh, yeah! He is a bastard”
“Wow!”
“And he, and he really does not give a damn
About the feelings of women!
And it's sad! It's really sad”
“Well you think that's bad, listen to this”

One day I met an ape of great charisma
Magilla the Gorilla was his name
He wore a little hat and matching bow tie
A fashion which has brought him great acclaim

I said, ""What do you see as your career-peak?
Of all your many flashy escapades”
He said, ""Well this is funky, but you're lookin' at the monkey
Who’s responsible for bringing you the AIDS“

All cartoons are fuckin' dicks
They get their kicks from being pricks
It's a quirk, we just can't fix
'Cause all cartoons are fuckin' dicks

“So he’s the cold prick?”
“I say that is just awful!”
“Okay, okay! Listen to this little gem""

I had a conversation at a party
With famous Rabbit Hunter Elmer Fudd
He told me I just had to see his rifle
And dropped it on the table with a thud

I said to him, “It’s quite a lovely firearm”
He told me his fiancé likes it too
He said, “This maybe corny but it really gets me horny
When I press it to her temple while we screw!”

All cartoons are fuckin' dicks
They get their kicks from being pricks
It's a quirk, we just can't fix
'Cause all cartoons are fuckin' dicks

“Aw, God! That is one shit bastard!”
“Eww, you’re not kidding?”
“Yeah, that, that kinda’ stuff’s against the law too, I think”
“Well, I got one that’s even worse than that”

On Friday night I went to get some candy
Some soda and some chips and other stuff
Along the way I passed a little alley
And there I saw that K-9 called McGruff

I said to him, “Hey! You’re that famous crime dog!”
He said, “I only work from nine to five!
And now it’s close to tennish and I got a job to finish
‘Cause as you can see this hooker’s still alive!”

All cartoons are fuckin' dicks
They get their kicks from being pricks
It's a quirk, we just can't fix
'Cause all cartoons are fuckin' dicks

“That’s awful!”
“Uh! Imagine McGruff beating up hookers!”
“He is a dick, he is a dick!”
“Yes, yes! He’s a nasty cartoon, but I can top that
Listen to this!”

One day as I was strolling through the forest
I happened on some mushroom covered turf
And there from underneath a patro-fungus
Emerged the one and only Papa Smurf

He said, “This is our secret mushroom village!”
I said, “Then I’m the first to see these views?”
He said, “I’m only kidding
‘Cause we only keep it hidden from the Asians
Adams, Faggots, Blacks and Jews!”

All cartoons are fuckin' dicks
They get their kicks from being pricks
It's a quirk, we just can't fix
'Cause all cartoons are fuckin' dicks

“That Papa Smurf sounds like a monster!”
“Oh, he’s a dirty, nasty racist and a bigot and homophobe
And you know what I did when I got home?”
“What?”
“I called up Gargamel and I told him where the village is!”
“That’s sweet""

“Can I go next?”
“Of course, sweetie!”

“One day I met a”
“Holy crap! Look who’s here, it’s Jason Alexander!”
“Hey, Cartoon-haters!”
“But, but I was supposed to go next!”
“Quiet, honey! Mr. Alexander wants to talk!”

“I couldn't help overhearing what you were talking about and I agree
Cartoons are real fuckin' assholes!”
“Yeah, that’s sorta what we’ve been trying to communicate”
“Well, get a load of this!”
“He said load!”
“I know! I heard!”

I once met Scooby-Doo at a premiere bash
He looked a little haggard and he stunk
He said, “The trouble started last December
When Daphne made a pass while she was drunk”

And now he’s got a child out of wedlock
It’s dealing his career a fatal blow
I asked him, “Where’s the baby?”
He said, “Jason, buddy, maybe now you see
Why fuckin’ Scrappy’s gotta go!”

All cartoons are fuckin' dicks
They get their kicks from being pricks
It's a quirk, we just can't fix
'Cause all cartoons are fuckin' dicks

“Wow, Scrappy is the bastard child of Scooby and Daphne?”
“Shocking, isn’t it?”
“Yeah! Hey, you douche bags wanna wrap this up?”

So let us leave you now with one suggestion
A bit of wisdom you can take for free
The Mickeys and the Goofys and the Daffys
Are not the gentle souls they seem to be

So anytime Sylvester catches Tweety
Or Tom has got poor Jerry in a fix
He’s in a fix! Sit back and just observe it
‘Cause the little shits deserve it
For all cartoons are fuckin' dicks

“So! When do we get to the 'off-color' part of the album?”

There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet

Jason Carr,"[1st verse:]
The different lays of nowadays
All set my brain a whirl
They're not the kind of songs they sang
When mother was a girl
Your spoony rags and coony drags
All made my poor heart ache
Bring back the rhymes of olden times
And just for old times sake
[Refrain:]
Won't you play a simple melody
Like my mother sang to me
One with good old fashioned harmony
Play a simple melody
[2nd verse:]
In days of yore, before the war
When hearts now old were young
At home each night by firelight
Those dear old songs were sung
Sweet melodies, their memories
Around my heart still cling
That's why I long to hear a song
Like mother used to sing
[Rag Verse:]
I don't care for long haired musicians
With their classy melodies
They have lots of highbrow ambitions
But their music doesn't please
Give me something snappy and popular
The kind that darkies play
Lots of rhythm
And I go with 'em
That's why I say
[Rag Refrain:]
Musical Demon
Set your honey a-dreamin'
Won't you play me some rag
Just change that classical nag
To some sweet beautiful drag
If you will play from a copy
Of a tune that is choppy
You'll get all my applause
And that is simply because
I want to listen to rag

The autumn leaves are red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sunburned hands I used to hold

Since you went away, the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter song
But I miss you most of all, my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

Since you went away, the days grow longer
And soon I'll hear old winter song
But I miss you most of all, my darling

Jason Carter,"Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
With ""Boy thought I told you not to go outside""
Trying your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whooping your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
'Cause I love them so

Brother says he's telling
About you playing doctor with that girl
Just don't tell I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smoking cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (""You nasty boy."")
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing isn't right
But while you were doing it-it sure felt out to sight

That old dirt road, out of this town

And I pray, that someday, I’ll ride this highway, 
Till it turns to that dirt road again

And that river of traffic that runs by my window, never seems to run dry
And tonight, before sleeping, I pray God is keeping, that old place that I left behind

And it costs you everything you’ve got

And the drugs you sent came just in time

How hard it gets sometimes

But I'm drawn to the light
In the reckless skyline
And I paint pink night

You feeding birds right out of your hand
On the sidewalk cafe while the street preacher quotes old testament

Greed is a conviction 
Loves a dirty word 
It'll bring you down to earth 
Love is a dirty word 

From a birds eye view you can see it 
Its sublime and its absured 
You can buy it and you can sell it 
But nobodies figured out how to make it work 

You can talk about it, like it or not 
Or you can call it a curse 
But in the end its all buried treasure underneath the mud 
It'll bring you down to earth 
Love is a dirty word 

Down the snakes and up the ladders

Miss you but wont give me an answer 
But im still waiting on the second punch

Jason Derulo,"Drop that beat, it's the truth
You don't know what you have until you lose it

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine
In my life, in my life
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money
In my life, in my life

I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues
Earned my stripes
But nothing compares to the love
I have for you, have for you

All I know is the hustle and grind
And all you want is some quality time
But I can't give it to you due to the life that I chose
My heart?s so cold to the point my blood it froze

I might wear diamonds if they really could freeze time
But then again time is money and I needs mine
There I go again being selfish
And here you go again in love and helpless

You mean the world to me, baby you know it's the truth
But I don't know who I love more, you or the booth
These are just some things I need to get off my chest
Sometimes I feel all I can give you is sex, I'm sorry

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine
In my life, in my life
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money
In my life, in my life

I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues
Earned my stripes
But nothing compares to the love
I have for you, have for you

I ain't gon' lie baby, this life is addicting
The fame, the money, especially these bitches
I've been around it all, I've seen 'em ball
I've seen 'em fall, go broke and lose it all

That's why I work hard 365, 24/7 baby, this my life
I breathe, I bleed, I eat, I sleep, I shit this
I got a bad stomach with these haters on my shit list

Baby, I know it's hard to understand
But it's out of my hands, baby this is God's plan
I came, I saw, I conquered
I apologize but this game made me a monster, I'm sorry

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine
In my life, in my life
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money
In my life, in my life

I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues
Earned my stripes
But nothing compares to the love
I have for you, have for you

In my life, I done some wrong
I done some right
In my life, I done some wrong
I done some right

In my life, I done some wrong
I done some right
In my life, I done some wrong
I done some right

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine
In my life, in my life
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money
In my life, in my life

I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues
Earned my stripes
But nothing compares to the love
I have for you, have for you

I done some wrong and some right, yeah
Derulo, Pitbull, this how we do

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine
In my life, in my life

Since the first date when you got close my heart
Would just stop thought me and you together would end
Up on top, you changed me for better for worse I know
I was caught up alway's put you first I never once thought
You would be triflin' but oh I was blinded

I was like oh oh oh never wanna let you go go go
I was open before I was open before but
Now I know, love made me blind so I couldn't
See all the lies you told were right in front of me
Since love made me blind you made a fool of me
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be
Your love made me blind

I gave all of my trust didn't think being faithful was asking
To much but I'm good glad that I know now I was fooled but
Fate let me see how they say every tear has it's reasons
Every smile has it's own season never once thought
You'd would be triflin' but oh I was blinded

Your love me blind
Your love made me blind
Your love made me blind
Your love made me blind

Cause I felt your lips pressed against mine thought the
Sweet smell of your perfume was all mine, I love the
Way you scream my name

That love made me blind so I couldn't see
All the lies you told were right in front of me

Thinkin' bout, like do I got any enemies
Where I've been, what I did, what did I say

I remember one chick
That I was messing with
When I was in Connecticut,
I met her after my show,
I took her back to my room

I never thought it would get this deep

Now I got this problem following me
Better be careful, better be careful
Better be careful
Whose heart you break
Never knowin' what you do
?
Next time I will be careful!

Saying 'Dear Jason you and I are meant to be'
? be the death of me

Got me so paranoid I'm stepping up security
It's getting crazy here, it' difficult for me to sleep

How do I get out of this
I'm feeling kinda sick

Cause no one burst

So why is it getting worse
I just don't wanna face this battle alone

How will it be with me when it hits me
Can it happen in a second
Will it be just like a ringing bell
When it calls me

Is it just like music and lights
Or is that just a fairytale

See the lights

Got off the greyhound at the port in New York City 
Looking for a break and some fame and fortune

My father said boy its dangerous out there 
You better use a jimmy hat 
And don't forget your combat boots, boy 

Who's the white boy over there? 
With the feather in his hair 
I'm gonna beat him and rob him 
I swear 
He must be new 'cause he ain't from here 
Gonna bust him down 
With a left to the ear 

Got knocked on the floor 
After they took my lucky jacket 
But you can't have my guitar so 
I swung my case and kicked 'em in the face 
I had my lights knocked out in New York City 
But when I came to I saw a beautiful woman starin' down at me 
And so I just had to say 

Oh, what a beautiful day. 
He's a white boy with a feather 
I really love this day 
He's a white boy with a feather 
I wouldn't rather be anywhere 
Where I am, Oo
Back in her crib, we played strip poker 
I was losing big, 
Down to nothing but my boots and 
My feather in my hair when she 
Took off her wig 
And said you been had, I'm a man 
This is my gun 
Give me your money, and run 

Ah, who's the white boy over there? 
With the feather in his hair 
And no under wear 
He must be smokin' or jokin' I swear 
Trippin on sometin' 
Butt naked runnin' through Times Square 

So I grab my guitar and I fly down 42nd street 
And I stopped in Times Square 
And played my song, here's a little ditty for NY City 
No one seemed to notice 
Only made a few pennies 
Was about to move on

I was lost in a world of strangers
No one to trust
On my own, I was lonely

It was cloudy before but now it's clear
You took away the fear
You brought me back to life

You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime

You're my life

Now I wake up everyday
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
'Cause you love me
You help me understand
That love is the answer to all that I am
And I'm a better man

On the beach I built sand castles too
My moonbeams faded my castles tumbled

No more chasing moonbeams or catching falling stars
I know now my pot of gold is anywhere you are
My heart won't miss you my heart goes with you
Loneliness is emptiness but happiness is you

I tried to doubt you and live without you
Tried to deny but I love you like a do
But I realize now and I'll admit it
You'll always be a part of me 'cause happiness is you

You'll never meet a girl like Equeena I bet
But if you ever shall than consider you blessed
She's rich beyond the natural so my spirit's impressed

Had an encounter with this gal at Grammatical show
She was looking unfamiliar but someone I'd like to know
So I thought possibly could she be of the same mind
Taken by her beauty but was anxious to find..
Out. See what this woman was all about
But I doubt I'll get the time of day so I'm out
I thought to myself, you'll never know until you ask her
Well, I tend to dig the chicks that do agree with my pastor
So I inquired 'bout her name she threw it out but I missed it
At first I had the jitters to nervous to even listen
Shook her hand said, ""Hi, I'm Knowda or Verbs is what's preferred.""
She cracked a smile like a baby and I'm glad that part occurred
With that she broke the ice the conversation was nice
Should I ask her for her number? Don't think twice
I tried to stay on my toes and kick the lines that were witty
And avoid saying things like, ""Gee, Equeena you're so pretty!""
Kept my cool and maintained never thought she saw me sweat
But I never will forget the day that we met
She had an ill type of radiance you felt when her presence
With a certain type of glow like lamps that be fluorescent
Her own type of flav that stretched from head to toe
I think when she was made they went and dipped the mold in gold
The way she moved was angelic she my eyes dance
At first I was a skeptic at this love at first glance

Lemme tell you 'bout this girl named Equeena I met
You'll never meet a girl like Equeena I bet
But if you ever shall than consider you blessed
She's rich beyond the natural so my spirit's impressed

A couple of hours have passed we've shared some things an we've laughed
In my book from one to ten she rates eleven and a half
You can tell she opened up as the time flew by
She was no plain Jane looking for the average Joe
Equeena had plans she's not the type to live trife
She wants to graduate from college wants to live a Godly life
She wants to go wherever she feel God leads her
Wants to hook up with a man that honestly feels he needs her
So the fact that we actually crossed paths it all seems odd
She let me know first off she wants a man who seeks God
So I thought BINGO! Can I please be a contestant?
Thanking God for early Christmas an unwrapped present
He must've reached into the heavens took the fixing's and the makens
And made the girl of my dreams that I could see when I'm awakened
The time drew near for us to part for the momento
Got her little backpack took some paper and passed a pencil
Needless to say by that I was deeply flattered
Taking note of her fragrance and the way her eyes have battered
I explained her the blessing just to meet her acquaintance
She gave a hug and I was like a king
It's like I can't just say goodbye somebody call the F.B.I
I've caught a case of the love bug and can't deny
But wonder why? We came so close at an escalated rate
I think she's in the Syllabus, man God is great!

Supplies slim, morale once so heavily inside them

Return is not an option as necessity denies them
With this they choose to dive in
Now along the shore and so aware of their arriving
Other children of this land prepared to share in their surviving
A pageantry of feathers stands his majesty with treasure
Not the material things of kings that could never last forever
But secrets of the spirit world and how to live in harmony together
Unbeknownst to him his head would be the first that they would sever

Kept up as a warning to the rest to turn away from their beliefs

You kill but do not eat it
The excessive and elitists don't repair it when they leave it

As archaeologists dig in the deserts of the east
Appeared a 100 meters wide and 100 meters deep
They discover ancient cars on even older streets
And a city well preserved and most likely at its peak
A culture so advanced, and by condition of the teeth
They can tell that they was civil, not barbaric in the least
A society at peace. 
With liberty and justice for all
Neatly carved in what seems to be a wall
They would doubt that there was any starvation at all
That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved
From the sheer amount of paper, most likely used for trade
Everything's so organized. 
They had to be well behaved
Assumed they had clean energy, little to no enemies
Very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies
Religions kinda complex. 
Kinda hard to figure out
And this must be the temple
This White House
