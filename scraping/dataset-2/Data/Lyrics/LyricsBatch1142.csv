The Forester Sisters,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
An emblem of sufferin' and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a word of lost sinners were slain

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the old rugged cross, I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown",The Old Rugged Cross,1997
The Forester Sisters,"I've just seen a face,
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-m'mm-mm

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware.
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Yeah!
Bup-a-lup-bup!

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

I've just seen a face,
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.

And she keeps calling
Me back again.",I've Just Seen a Face,2002

The Format,"I can't stand to think about a heart so big it hurts like hell. Oh my God I gave my best but for three more years to end like this. Well do you want to fall apart? I can't stop if you can't start. Do you want to fall apart? I could if you can try to fix what I've undone. Cause I hate what I've become.
(Chorus) You know me, oh you think you do, you just don't seem to see. I've been waiting all this time to be something that I can't define. So let's cause a scene. Clap our hands and stomp our feet. Or something, yeah something. I've just gotta get myself over me.
I could stand to do without all the people I have left behind. What's the point in going around when its straight line baby. A straight line down. So let's make a list of who we need and it's not much if any thing. Lets make a list of who we need and well throw it away cause we don't need anyone, no we don't need anyone.
And I hate what I've become. You know the night life is just not for me, cause all you really need are a few good friends. I don't want to go out and be on my own, you know they started something I can't stand. You leave for the city, well count me out. Cause all this time is wasted on everything I've done.",The First Single,
The Format,"Well I made my way back down to the valley, right on past 83rd St.. That's where we once belonged, but I'm gone, I swear I'm long gone.

(Chorus)So give it up throw your hats in the air, and change just as they land, your saying “We'll get out of here” but something tells me your to scared to go.
 
So the stairs that you could climb are the ones you've left behind and your eyes light up when we talk about the past. God I miss those songs we used to sing. Talking like getting away would be the greatest thing. Well me, I got out, and you singing to me like that's really gunna set this free.

(Chorus)

Like a ghost you've been haunting all these dusty old roads and old homes. The ones we swore we'd never go, never go. As for Joe, oh I've seen him around. Then there's Adam, he's afraid to go out. I don't blame him I just wanted to go out to eat. Then there's Mark, goddamn I wish him the best. We were kids back then as if we could progress. But sometimes I just can't sleep, thinking of everything we could have been.

The Format,"Hold on, there's a hole in my heart 
Everyone can see right through me 
It goes all the way to the waves 
Where my love she tried to wash it away 

see we break for the summers 
So she can find lovers 
She treats them like a bottle of wine 
They make you dinner 
And they sing you to sleep 
But by the morning find the bottle is empty 

'Cause she never gives it the time 
Every bottle she finds 
They don't compare 
To the ones she left behind 
There is never a note 
So she waits for me to come back home 

I'm looking for a dead end song 
You wish that smoke 
Could change its color 
I love it when you talk so much 
And act like nothing went wrong 
I'm looking for a dead end song 
While we sit and find flaws in everyone 
I want to keep you by my side 
Holding off tidal waves 

""Mint car"" is keeping us warm 
She lays crossed upon the bed 
We are puzzles making shapes 
With our hands 
I take my finger, turn into a pen 
Then I run my hand down your spine 
You guess I wrote something profound 
Something like: 
""Our love will last 'till we die"" 
I say ""you're good at this game"" 
But what I really wrote is 
""How I've yet to be saved""",Dead End,2006

Before the clouds appeared and took away my sunshine

Here comes that rainy day feeling again
And I'll be dreaming of you, baby, in vain
Your face is always on my mind, girl
I'm hoping soon you're gonna find, girl

You've got your troubles, I've got mine
She's found somebody else to take your place
You've got your troubles, I've got mine

I too have lost my love today
All of my dreams have flown away

Now just like you, I sit and wonder why
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
You need some sympathy, well so do I
You've got your troubles, I've got mine

She used to love me, that I know
And it don't seem so long ago

That we were walking
And we were talking
The way that lovers do

I too have lost my love today
All of my dreams have flown away

And so forgive me if I seem unkind (I ain't got no pity for you)
You've got your troubles, I've got mine (I lost, I lost, I lost my little girl
Too)

I know it's nothing to do-o-o-o-
Now I'm on my own, I walk alone

Here it comes again, that feeling
Here it comes again

When love walked out a fire went out inside of me
It wouldn't hide those tears inside of me

Then there's nothing left for me to say
You no, you no, you no you broke my heart

The Fortunes,"In the eyes of the world I'm a loser just wastin' my time
I can't make a dime
In the eyes of the world being born was my first big mistake
I can't get a break
But in the eyes of my woman I stand
Like a hero, a giant, a man who's as tall as can be
Any fool can see

That she's lookin' through the eyes of love
Lookin' through the eyes of love
Lookin' through the eyes of love when she looks at me-ee.

In the eyes of the crowd I'm a do-nothin' kind of a guy
Who'll just live and die

That she's lookin' through the eyes of love
Lookin' through the eyes of love
Lookin' through the eyes of love when she looks at me-ee.
She's making me believe someday
Someday I'm gonna find a way

This golden ring's gonna make quite sure that we never part
It's so funny what a ring can do
Make a girl just like you take a ride down town
Searchin' for a wedding gown
This golden ring's gonna bring a little tear to my baby's eyes
She's gonna be so happy and just like a woman she'll cry
She will smile and I know that no matter what the future may show 
It's gonna be the two of us eternally

The oak tree where you carved my name
A year ago now
Somehow doesn't really look the same

I think it closed now

Still play the songs we used to know

Telling me that maybe I'm
Not really over you

I still get the same old yearning
Turning my heart inside out

Is overgrown now
We dreamed we'd live there too someday

Just on our own now

Still bring that sentimental ring

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

To kids from one to ninety-two

Noel,noel
Born is the king of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued, both day and night.

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far,
To seek for a king was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.

This star drew nigh to the northwest;
O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest.
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

Then they did know assuredly
Within that house, the king did lie
One entered in then for to see
And found the babe in poverty.

Then entered in those wise men three,
Full reverently, upon bended knee,
And offered there, in his presence,
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

We shall be free from death and hell

I understand.
It's not your fault because your heart has changed it's mind

The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you

You come, and pour, yourself, on me.

The Four Tops,"A man can walk proudly, 
Down in the street. 
A man's not ashamed of what he believes. 

He knows how to laugh, 
He knows when to cry. 
He knows it's best to live. 
He's afraid to die. 

What is a man, 
What is a man? 
What is a man, 
What is a man? 

A man searches, 
For the key to success. 
He'd rather be sure, 
Than take a wild guess. 

He knows how to love, 
He knows how to hate. 
He knows when to move. 
He knows just when to wait. 

What is a man, 
What is a man? 
What is a man, 
What is a man? 

A man can be angry, 
& still hold his tongue 
A man don't give up 
Till the battle is won. 

He knows how to win, 
He's not ashamed to lose. 
He knows his destiny 
is his alone to choose

That I've tasted

I think about her face aglow and ease my mind

And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me

Whenever you touch me
I give in to you

Make me lose my head
But memories unwind
To find my hear again
Ooh, but I stubbornly I go

'Cause I'm reaching for the door

And I feel your hand touch me
And my heart gives in
I just can't walk away
Whenever you touch me

And I'm well aware of what's on their minds.
They pretend to be my friend, when all the time
They long to persuade you from my side.

They'd give the world and all they own
For just one moment we have known.
Bernadette, they want you because of the pride that gives,
But Bernadette, I want you because I need you to live.

But while I live only to hold you,
Some other men, they long to control you.
But how can they control you Bernadette,
When they can not control themselves, Bernadette,

From wanting you, needing you,
But darling you belong to me.

I'll tell the world you belong to me,
I'll tell the world, you're the soul of me,
I'll tell the world you're a part of me.

In your arms I find the kind of peace of mind
The world is searching for,
But you, you give me the joy this heart of mine
Has always been longing for.

In you I have what other men long for.
All men need someone to worship and adore,
That's why I treasure you and place you high above,
For the only joy in life is to be loved.

Bernadette, keep on needing me,

When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fails, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has not
To say the words he truly feels
And not the words he would reveal

And did it my way

And did it my way",My Way,1990

Is it in your heart to care?

With every step that you take you pay your dues
And I ain't lying

It's like a jungle outside the door
And it's keeping you so confused

Then the first snow came and he ran out to brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited slipped and almost hurt himself and I laughed till I cried

Though I pretended hard to be

Guess you could say he saw through me and hugged my neck
He came home unexpectedly and caught me crying needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring when flowers bloom and robins sing he went away
And honey I miss you and I'm being good and I'd love to be with you if only I could
One day while I was not at home and he was there and all alone the angels came

Now all I have are memories of honey and I wake up nights and call his name
Now my life's an empty stage where honey lived and honey played and love grew up
And a small cloud passes overhead and cries down on the flower bed that honey loved

How can you watch me cry after all I done for you
Hold on a minute

Gave you all the love I had now, didn't I?
When you needed me I was always there now, wasn't I?

I'm trying hard not to cry out loud
You know crying it ain't gonna help me now
What did I do to cause all this grief?
Now what'd I say to make you want to leave

Saying together forever
Breaking up never

Better keep 'em in mind.

Will bring another love their way

(Ah) But ask the lonely
(Ah) How vainly a heart can yearn,
(Ah) For losing a love that will never return

Just ask the lonely
Just ask the lonely
They'll tell you

Ooh, Woo hoo hoo hoo ooh

(Ah) They'll tell you a story of sadness,
(Ah) A story too hard to believe
Ah, they'll tell you the loneliest one is me

Just ask the lonely
Just ask the lonely

Ask me
I'm the loneliest one you'll see

Just ask the lonely",Ask the Lonely [Live],2007
The Four Tops,"Bernadette, people are searchin' for
The kind of love that we possess.
Some go on searchin' their whole life through
And never find the love I've found in you.
And when I speak of you I see envy in other men's eyes,
And I'm well aware of what's on their minds.
They pretend to be my friend, when all the time
They long to persuade you from my side.
They'd give the world and all they own
For just one moment we have known.
Bernadette, they want you because of the pride that gives,
But Bernadette, I want you because I need you to live.
But while I live only to hold you,
Some other men, they long to control you.
But how can they control you Bernadette,
When they can not control themselves, Bernadette,
From wanting you, needing you,
But darling you belong to me.
I'll tell the world you belong to me,
I'll tell the world, you're the soul of me,
I'll tell the world you're a part of me.
In your arms I find the kind of peace of mind
The world is searching for,
But you, you give me the joy this heart of mine
Has always been longing for.
In you I have what other men long for.
All men need someone to worship and adore,
That's why I treasure you and place you high above,
For the only joy in life is to be loved.
So whatever you do, Bernadette, keep on loving me,
Bernadette, keep on needing me,
Bernadette.",Bernadette [Live],2007
The Four Tops,"Sugarpie honeybunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
In and out my life
You come and you go
Leaving just your picture behind
And I kissed it a thousand times

When you snap your fingers
Or wink your eye
I come a running to you
I'm tied to you, baby
And there's nothing I can do
Ooh, sugar

Sugarpie honeybunch
I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love you see
want to tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through
And I've tried
But every time I see your face
I get up all choked up inside

When I call your name, girl
It starts the flame burning in my heart
Tearin' it all apart
No matter how I try
My love I cannot hide

Sugarpie honeybunch
You now that I'm weak for you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

I can't help myself
I want you and nobody else

The Four Tops,"In the still of the night
As I gaze from my window
At the Moon in its flight
My thoughts all stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world is in slumber
Oh, the times without number
Darling, when I say to you

Do you love me as I love you
Are you my life to be, my dream come true
Or will this dream of mine fade out of sight
Like the Moon growing dim on the rim of the hill
In the chill, still of the night",In the Still of the Night [Live],2007
The Four Tops,"You're sweet as a honey bee
But like a honey bee stings
You've gone and left my heart in pain
All you left is our favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
It used to bring sweet memories
Of a tender love that used to be
Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
A sentimental fool am I
To hear a old love song
And want to cry
But the melody keeps haunting me
Reminding me how in love we used to be
Keep hearing the part that used to touch my heart
Saying together forever
Breaking up never
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
Precious memories keep a lingering on
Everytime I hear our favorite song
Now you're gone
Left this emptiness
I only reminisce
The happiness we spent
We used to dance on the music
Make romance through the music
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone",It's the Same Old Song [Live],2007
The Four Tops,"Spring was never waiting for us, girl 
It ran one step ahead 
As we followed in the dance 
Between the parted pages and were pressed 
In love's hot, fevered iron 
Like a striped pair of pants 

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark 
All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain 
I don't think that I can take it 
Cause it took so long to bake it 
And I'll never have that recipe again 
Oh, no! 

I recall the yellow cotton dress 
Foaming like a wave 
On the ground around your knees 
The birds, like tender babies in your hands 
And the old men playing checkers by the trees 

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark 
All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain 
I don't think that I can take it 
Cause it took so long to bake it 
And I'll never have that recipe again 
Oh, no! 

There will be another song for me 
For I will sing it 
There will be another dream for me 
Someone will bring it 
I will drink the wine while it is warm 
And never let you catch me looking at the sun 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
You'll still be the one 

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it 
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it 
I will have the things that I desire 
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
I'll be thinking of you 
And wondering why 

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark 
All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain 
I don't think that I can take it 
Cause it took so long to bake it 
And I'll never have that recipe again 
Oh, no! 
Oh, no 
No, no 
Oh no!!",Macarthur Park [Live],2007
