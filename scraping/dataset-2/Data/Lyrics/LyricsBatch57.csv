Christina Aguilera,"Somos novios

Pues los dos sentimos

Mutuo amor profundo.

Y con eso ya ganamos

Lo más grande de este mundo.

Nos amamos, nos besamos

Como novios nos deseamos

Y hasta a veces sin motivo

Sin razón, nos enojamos.

 

Somos novios

Mantenemos un cariño limpio y puro

Como todos

Procuramos el momento

Más oscuro para hablarnos

Para darnos

El más dulce de los besos

Recordar de qué color

Son los cerezos

 

Sin hacer más comentarios

Somos novios.

Somos novios.

Somos novios.

Siempre novios.

Christina Aguilera,"You know who you are
This is for you

Yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, ohh

I thought I knew who you were
I see now you were a lesson to learn
And all I am to you now
Is a bridge that's been burned

Now I was the first to believe
I made you part of my musical dream
And your thanks to me
Came without an apology, yeah

We wrote 'Loving Me 4 Me', 'Don't Walk Away'
'Can't Hold Us Down', all part of our history
'Don't forget Infatuation', 'I'm a Fighter'
'Feeling Under-appreciated'

And I've been hooked ever since
Told my mother, my brother, my sister, and my friends
Told the others, my lovers, both past and present tense
That every time I see you everything starts making sense

Do your thang honey!

Back in the day, they used to say
Play that song, get it going, and the band played
And still today, you hear us say
Play that song all night long, Mr. DJ
Though times have change
It's still the same
We all need a minute to get away
So let it go, and feel the flow
If you've got soul, let the world know

So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James

Now 'Chain Of Fools' and 'Respect'
Was the anthem of a woman, Aretha said

Do you want to be widely entertained
People to know your name?
Do you crave fame?
Well, they say things aren't always what they seem to be
Even your greatest fantasies
You won't believe your eyes
Won't even recognize
The wonderment that lies
Behind the shimmer and the lights

Is it true what they say?
Is it all just fun and games?
Or is there more behind the makeup
And the faces full of paint?

I ask you, do you want to come and play?

But it ain't no thang to me
It really don't make any difference now to me

I'm gonna keep on; I'm a do my own thing
We all got a song that we're meant to sing
And no matter what people say, or might think
I ain't going no place; no, I'm here to stay
Gonna keep on doing my thing
'Cause whether they love or they're hatin' on me
I'll still be the same girl I used to be
'Cause I ain't going no place; no, I'm here to stay

I'm here to stay
I'm here to stay
I'm here to stay

I've never been the type to be shy
I know that some would say I'm too headstrong
But I'd rather be a woman who voices her mind
Whether you think I'm right or wrong

And I know some people wanna criticize
Makes them feel better 'bout themselves
So say what you will
Time will reveal
In the end that I will be here still

Gotta get up
Keep my head up
Gonna keep on turnin' it up, never let up
If I keep steppin' it up, I'm a prove that I ain't never gonna be stopped, like it or not
Gotta get up
Keep my head up
Gonna keep on turnin' it up, never let up
If I keep steppin' it up, I'm a prove that I ain't never gonna be stopped, like it or not

Whoa, whoa, whoa

No matter the pressures that face me
I believe, I believe that we'll see
I'll never let anyone break me
All your doubt can do now is strengthen me

And life - it ain't always that easy
Gotta fight to see past the boundaries
Crossin' the lines I will define
Every time
That forever is mine

Christina Aguilera,"Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
If only I knew what I know today
Ohhh ohhh

I would hold you in my arms
I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done
Forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To hear your voice again
Sometimes I want to call you, but I know you won't be there

I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you
Some days I feel broke inside, but I won't admit
Sometimes I just want to hide 'cause it's you I miss
You know it's so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this

Would you tell me I was wrong?
Would you help me understand?
Are you looking down upon me?
Are you proud of who I am?
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To have just one more chance
To look into your eyes and see you looking back

I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself

If I had just one more day, I would tell you how much that
I've missed you since you've been away

Oh, it's dangerous
It's so out of line to try to turn back time

I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself

By hurting you",Hurt,2006
Christina Aguilera,"Hm, yeah, yeah

Can't you see the way I move?
Can't you read it in my hips?
There's a lot that's going on
In my pocket full of tricks
Got some secrets up my sleeve

Got places you've never been
Take you out of your skin

It is now time
The one and only
There never will be another
Christina Aguilera
That's how music should sound

Oh yeah
I've waited for some time
To get inside the minds
Of every legend I've ever wanted to stand beside
It's like an endless ride
Feeling the lows and highs
Of every lyric and melody
Every single rhyme
So here I stand today
In tribute I do pay
To those before me who laid it down and paved the way
And so to God I pray that he will give me strength
To carry forward the gift of song in his good faith
In his good faith

I'm going back to basics
To where it all began
I'm ready now to face it
I wanna understand
What made the soul singers
And the blues figures
That inspired a higher generation
The jazz makers, and the ground breakers
They gave so much of themselves and dedication

So here I stand today
In tribute I do pay
To those before me who laid it down and paved the way

She always dreamt of a fairytale life
And all the things your money can't buy
She thought that he was a wonderful guy
Then, suddenly, things seemed to change
It was the moment she took on his name
He took his anger out on her face
She kept all of her pain locked away

It was the day that he turned on his kids
That she knew she just had to leave him
So many voices inside of her head
Saying over and over and over
'You deserve much more than this.'

She was so sick of believing the lies and trying to hide
Covering the cuts and bruises (cuts and bruises)
So tired of defending her life; she could have died
Fighting for the lives of her children

Christina Aguilera,"So many years have gone by
Always strong, tried not to cry
Never felt like I needed any man
To comfort me in life
But I'm all made up today
A veil upon my face
But no father stands beside me
To give this bride away

Well, I'm standing in the chapel
Wearing my white dress
I have waited for this moment
With tears of happiness
Here I leave behind my past
By taking the chance
I've finally found the right man

Thoughts racing fast through my mind
As I'm gazing down the aisle
That my future will mend the memories
Torn between father and child

My emotions overload
'Cause there is no hand to hold
There's no shoulder here to lean on
I'm walking all on my own

Here I go

Now I'm standing at four corners
To have and to hold
Now, my love, you stand beside me
To walk life's winding road
And I owe it all to you
For taking that chance
You've shown me there's a right man
'Cause I never knew the right man

Well, I'm standing in the chapel
Ready to confess
That I've waited for this moment
With tears of happiness
Now I leave behind my past
By taking the chance
Whoa

Well, I'm standing at four corners
To have and to hold
Now, my love, you stand beside me
To walk life's winding road
And I owe it all to you
For taking the chance

And one day, my little girl
Will reach out her hand
She'll know I found the right man",The Right Man,2006

It gets so complicated

Everything I put you through

When I'm about to fall
Somehow you're always waitin'
With your open arms to catch me
You're gonna save me from myself
From myself, yes
You're gonna save me from myself

My love is tainted by your touch
'Cause some guys have shown me aces
But you've got that royal flush

Well, tomorrow may be shaky
But you never turn away

You know how to keep me smilin'

Or in the pages of your magazine
Looking just a little differently
Showing off a softer side of me

They say that love has gone and changed me
But don't be fooled by everything you see
Gotta let the naughty in me free

There's a woman inside of all of us
Who never quite seems to get enough
Trying to play by the rules is rough
'Cause sooner or later something's gonna erupt us

And if you're still rolling with me, still got it
No matter what you thinking of me, still dirty

Why is a woman's sexuality
Always under so much scrutiny?
Why can't she do exactly as she please
Without being called a million things?

They say I'm not the girl they used to know (used to know)
'Cause I don't always wear revealing clothes (oh)
But don't be fooled: the moment I get home (I get home)
I'm letting loose, giving a private show (Don't you know?)

There's some women out there who talk and stare
Who never seem to let down their hair
Like to past judgment, but they're just scared
And don't know what they're missing; so they better beware

If I want to be erotic in my own videos
If I want to be provocative, well, that ain't a sin
Maybe you're not comfortable in your own skin

Christina Aguilera,"Whoa, oh, yeah

She was so young with such innocent eyes
She always dreamt of a fairytale life
And all the things your money can't buy
She thought daddy was a wonderful guy
Then, suddenly, things seemed to change
It was the moment she took on his name
He took his anger out on her face
She kept all of her pain locked away

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed
Oh mother, don't look back
'Cause he'll never hurt us again

So, mother, I thank you
For all you've done and still do
You got me, I got you
Together we always pull through
We always pull through
We always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother

It was the day that he turned on his kids
That she knew she just had to leave him
So many voices inside of her head
Saying over and over and over
'You deserve much more than this.'

She was so sick of believing the lies and trying to hide
Covering the cuts and bruises (cuts and bruises)
So tired of defending her life; she could have died
Fighting for the lives of her children

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed (all of the tears you have shed)
Oh mother, don't look back
'Cause he'll never hurt us again (He'll never hurt us again)

So, mother, I thank you (thank you)
For all that you've done and still do (still do)
You got me, I got you
(Yeah, you got me, and I got you)
Together we always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother

All of your life you have spent
Burying hurt and regret
But, mama, he'll never touch us again

For every time he tried to break you down
Just remember who's still around
It's over, and we're stronger
And we'll never have to go back again

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed
Oh mother, don't look back (Oh mother, don't look back again)
'Cause he'll never hurt us again 'Cause he'll never hurt us again)

So, mother, I thank you (And I thank you for everything you've done)
For all that you've done and still do (Together we always move on)
You got me, I got you (You got me, I got you)
Together we always pull through (always pull through)

Just give it to me, I won't bite

Shake this feeling got me paralyzed

Wishing for this, hoping for all we know
Hearing you breathe, you leave and return
Oh, how we take, how we give we learn

Taking my time, seeing the signs
Letting you guide me home
Watching you grow, letting you know
You are my only

You bring me hope when I can't breathe
You give me love, you're all I need
Slowly I'm holding you closely
You're wrapped in my arms and you're inside me

Tell you my fears, telling you everything
Telling the truth to you gives me wings
Free with my words, free as a bird
I am flying high looking at you

Everything new, you are my life
You bring me hope when I can't breathe
And you give me love, you're all I need
Slowly I'm holding you closely

So happy to carry you inside me
I'll feed you, love, and I hope it's enough
To inspire you through suffering, holding you up
I'll feed you, love, and I hope it's enough

Step into the picture that I paint you to my brain game
I let her date you so I give you a migraine
Over and over, put it on me, later you're insane
This is a roller coaster that's about to be long gone
Once you jump in, we're gonna get up on the lump and hold on
Just let it go, get it up, allow yourself to transform
Follow me, follow me to a place I know of no return

Call me the supernova that's taking over all time and space
I'm testing your dimension, can't keep up with what I create
I'll break your concentration, imagination with what I make

Everything not quite what it seems to be
Slipping and falling through the looking glass
Catching a glimpse at all that lies behind the masks

You disappear with the dawn
You only see what you want

When you're out with the birds of prey (prey, prey, prey)
When you're out with the birds of prey

They watch and they feed
They take what they need
They bite as you bleed
The birds of prey

Taking the blue pill only made you cry
And all that the red pill did was make you forget why
There is no right, there's no wrong
You only see what you want

When you're out with the birds of prey

They watch and they feed
They take what they need
They bite as you bleed

'Cause it comes and goes and pins me like a trampoline
But all this back and forth is freaky, it's confusing me
Like a pencil trying to write and you're erasing me

If I was a ruler I'd set you straight
But your love is like a sharpener, it really grates
'Cause once I'm trying to bounce, you pull me back
And when I try to come to you, you give me slack

Your love is pulling like a rubber band
Your love is pulling like a rubber band

Elastic love, everlastic love
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love
Elastic love, everlastic love
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

A rubber band was an analogy
You can even say it's a metaphor
The tension between you and me
I ain't gonna feel it if you let it go

I can take a little bit and make it more
A little bit of hate can make it war
But a lot of love ain't enough
And so, I don't really know how we find the cure

Your love is pulling like a rubber band
Your love is pulling like a rubber band

Elastic love, everlastic love
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love
Elastic love, everlastic love
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love

Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together
Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together
Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together

If we were gaffer tape maybe we could spend the summer
You could say your piece, you could post it on a paper
When your love hits, it sticks me like a stapler

Your love is pulling like a rubber band
Your love is pulling like a rubber band

Elastic love, everlastic love
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love

As the music fades
And I'm left here with
With more than I can take

If you lift me up
Just get me through this night
I know I'll rest tomorrow
And I'll be strong enough to try

When the static clears
And all is said and done
I will realize
That we all need someone

If you lift me up
Just get me through this night
I know I'll rest tomorrow

And there's nowhere left to fall
Will you lift me even higher

If you lift me up
Said if you lift me up

Whoo-yeah, ah-yeah 
Whoo-yeah, ah-yeah 

Said if you lift me up
Will you lift me higher

Christina Aguilera,"Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in
Bet you would think I got it made, better look again
I got butler, got a maid, and a mansion
The belief is that I'm living out a millionaires fantasy
With phantoms and Ferrari's in the driveway
But you see I came and exchanged of a sane man's sanity,
Your vision jaded by the Grammy's on the mantelpiece
Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony
Apparently it's damaging the man you see before you
On the canvas he may seem alright
But all the disadvantages
His family encounters overshadows his extravagance
Walk in my nines a while, I dare you I'll scare you
While it really seem like the kings life ain't glamorous
As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs
Because the camera's don't see beyond the walls of the smiles
Only counts until it falls in the pile

Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

Honestly to me,
I think I'd lose every benefit
Of all that I've accomplished
If my kids never win at shit
Me knowing this, why should the verses I have laid
Be more important to me than the persons I have raised
I guess I'm saying that to say that opportunity
But they just don't equate to all the time they take away
From the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake
If Deyjah end up a stripper and Major slinging yay
How could I ever consider myself a great
If Messiah ain't paid and Nique Nique ain't straight
Would your favorite song about the whips, money and shit
Be relevant if you found out, the money wasn't real, nope
So me being the goat shouldn't mean more to me
Than see it to a king though
From a bad ass kid to man with some dough
Otherwise I may well have stayed poor
So while they stay focused on me beefin' with flip,
Shawty low, Gucci or Ludacris
Or if I'm fucking with a hoe
Did I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense
Internally I'm dealing with this conflict
So excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand
Or slap me in the face, aye I'm just the man
If they saying I ain't the best at making hit records
It's cause this my life these ain't just rapping
Shit, you think of that deep, did ya dog
See you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls
Bitch ain't thinking with the deep, did ya dog
Cause see you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls

Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

Nobody knows I'm all alone
Living in this castle made of stone
They say that money is freedom
But I feel trapped inside it all
And while I sit so high up on a throne
I wonder how I can feel this low
On top of the world it's beautiful
But there's no place to fall

For the record aye, I give a damn if I never said shit again
My career was meant for me to come and tell this
Honest interpretation of how affected I'm faced with
Matters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement
The day that I walk I ain't saying that I'm amazing
Down playing the way I keep fellas from catching cases
Won't take into consideration how much it mean what I'm saying
And when I say what I mean even when I'm surrounded by the fakers
From one of the greatest sinners, blessed with most of god's graces
Who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places
So next time you rating royalty,
I'm always being given to recordings than the level
Of your loyalty, obvious you've been ignoring me
Who else ya seen make it through the storm, unharmed disjointed
While all the critics was looking for prince charming
Disregarded the king of the south raised doubt
Even though he made a castle out of used to be a house
He did shit that all your favorites rappers only rap about
But most of y'all don't see the castle for the walls
And the smiles till it falls in piles so while

Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls",Castle Walls,2010

I don't want you to go
It's, it's there anything I can say to make you stay

I really can’t stay 
Baby it’s cold outside
I’ve got to go away
Darling it’s cold outside
This evening has been
I been hoping that you’d drop in (so very nice)
I’ll hold your hands, they’re just like ice

My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what’s your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fireplace roar
So really I’d better scurry (hey don't you worry)
Well maybe just a half a drink more
Why don't you put some records on while I pour

You see, the neighbors might think
Baby, it’s bad out there
Say, what’s in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight (to break the spell)
I’ll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no, sir (mind if I move in closer?)
At least i’m gonna say that I tried
What’s the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can’t stay
Baby don’t hold out
Baby it’s cold outside

I simply must go
Babay it’s cold outside
The answer is no
I said it's cold out there
This welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in (so very nice)
Look out the window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt’s mind is vicious
Oh, your lips are delicious
Oh maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before

I’ve got to go home (but baby, you’ll freeze out there)
Say, lend me your coat
It’s up to your knees out there
You’ve really been grand
I’m thrilled when you touch my hand (but don’t you see)
Darling how can you do this thing to me?

There’s bound to be talk tomorrow (think of my life long sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied 
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can’t stay get over that old lie

I mean, feel the wind blwoing

Inside lie the words just pleading to be heard

Now I'm ready gonna sing 'em all out
Sing 'em out just for myself
I don't even care what the world thinks about how I sound

'Cause when I open my mouth
My whole heart comes out
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied
I'm singing till I'm winning, Imma sing all night
'Cause when I open my mouth
There's no place to hide
Everything that I've been feeling runs wild and free
I'm singing 'cause, I'm winning Imma sing for me

I stand and believe in who I am
Take shots at my heart but who am I to give up
Everybody needs a melody to set their souls free
My stage is the greatest in the world
Give back to the ones who struggle with me stay true
Reminding me to see my only chosen destiny
And now I'm ready now I'm gonna sing it all out

I am anywhere but here

One glade of grief
Will always remain

And open my, I open my heart
Seem like a nightingale opened my, opened my hands

Christina Crerar,"Into a cabaret
One fatal day
A little songbird flew
Found it so very gay
He thought he'd stay
Just to get a bird's eye view

When he heard the jazz band playing
He was happy as a lark
To each measure he kept swaying
And he stayed 'til after dark

Then back to the land he knew
Thrilled through and through
He sailed on in the air
Called all the other birds
And in these words
Started gurgling then and there

I'm a little jazz bird
And I'm telling you to be one too
For a little jazz bird
Is in heaven when it's singin' blue

I say it with regret
But you're out of date
You ain't heard nothing yet
'Til you syncopate

When the going is rough
You will find your troubles all have flown
If you warble your stuff
Like the moanin' of a saxophone

Just try my recipe
And I'm sure you'll agree
That a little jazz bird
Is the only kind of bird to be

I say it with regret
But you're out of date
You ain't heard nothing yet
'Til you syncopate

When the going is rough
You will find your troubles all have flown

Christina Dellea,"I am an old woman named after my mother
My old man is another child that's grown old
If dreams were lightning thunder was desire
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago

[Chorus]
Make me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

[Chorus]

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today.
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say.

I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

You're feelin' me
And it's got you all fired up

'Cause you don't want your heart tied up

But I can feel the proof when you're holdin' me
Like to let you think you're controllin' me
Even thought that ain't the deal
When I want I take the wheel, and I know

Can't hide that you're really into me
Hold is so tight I can barely breathe

Who crunk it like me
Lotta of guys here but none is like me

Though some could try to be
With two or three chains up under the white tee
And I got two or three dames that's comin' tonight
See 'em, done tonight, leave

Like one eyed peace
Only Mike puts up numbers like these
And he's no longer playin'
But neither am I, so

What I'm sayin' is hop in the deuce seater with I
'Cause you know with them boots and that beater you fly
Other dudes act to cheap with the pie, won't drop a few pennies
Or cop you a guinea, but I'll cop you as many

Like pardon the Bravado in me
Us two that's a plan somehow
Get to know each other later, let's dance for now, c'mon

I couldn't let you see my crying eyes but I wanted so bad to run to you
How could you find someone in just so little time

We said we'd be friends maybe one day, give us one more try
I can't understand, it happened so fast, six months have passed
Now suddenly you've gotten over me

It hurts when I thought I had gotten over you
It hurts when together forever won't come true
It hurts when one broken heart is how it ends
'Cause it hurts to know that you are in love again

I'm trying so hard not to care but you're happy now and it's not fair
Just when I thought that I was getting strong, I see you with her
I was wrong

Now I can pretend that losing you, didn't mean a thing
And I can deny that this whole thing's not happening
To hold it inside, it's killing me, it's hurting me
If you could only see

It hurts when I thought I had gotten over you
It hurts when together, forever won't come true
It hurts when one broken heart is how it ends
'Cause it hurts to know that you are in love again

It hurts when I thought I had gotten over you
It hurts when together, forever, it won't come true
It hurts when one broken heart is how it ends, oh

Verse 1

Hey girl I hear your havin' trouble with your boyfriend again
And why do you keep letting him get away with everything
By now you should know that he's not treatin' you the way you deserve
Yeah I could see that he's fine and we all now love makes you blind
If it doesn't really benefit you, you'll be better off alone
Then it wasn't really meant to be, just move on (oohh)

Verse 2:
I'm not the type of girl to let somebody else run my life
You won't see me cryin' cause I couldn't get along with some guy
I've never been down with anybody that cannot treat me right

Didn't think i needed anyone.
I could make it on my own
Never thought about tomorrow, just livin' day to day
Never thought these clouds would come along
And bring me so much pain
When my world was upside down
I didn't think that i could make it,
Reached out my hand for you
And you were there to take it

I want to thank you
For being my strength when i thought i couldn't go on
And i want to thank you
Be,
till i get over you

Walked through the park, in the evening air
I heard a voice and i thought you were there
I run away but i just can't escape
Memories of you everywhere

But true love burns for a thousand years
Give my tomorrows for one yesterday
Just to know that i could have you here

When will this river of tears stop fallin'
Where can i run so i won't feel alone
Can't walk away when the pain keeps callin'

Christina Milian,"Baby every now and then you disappear from this earth
And where you been and where you go I don't know
But when you didn't up for till 2 I'm like where was you
Late again (you) didn't call on a cell that I bought

[Chorus]
I figured out when you open your mouth 
First you start forgettin' then your palms start sweatin'
Then you twitch, twitch
You can't disguise when you're caught in a lie
You always reply with a twitch, twitch

[Verse 2]
It's true your body language told on you
Tell me what'd you do 
First you lie, start to stutter
??
you're guilty and one day you gonna feel me
but you should know it's not right
it's not okay I wasn't born yesterday

Speak up, I can't hear you
What did you say boy wussup?
You so crazy acting this way, is there something
In your eyes 'cause you twitch when you look at mine",Twitch,2001
Christina Milian,"Woke up today thinking of you
Another night that I made my way through
So many dreams still left in my mind
But they can never come true
I press rewind and remember when
I close my eyes and I'm with you again
But in the end I can still feel the pain every time I hear your name

The sun won't shine since you went away
Seems like the rain's falling every day
There's just one heart, where there once was two
But that's the way it's gotta be,
'Til I get over you

Walked through the park, in the evening air
I heard a voice and I thought you were there
I run away but I just can't escape
Memories of you everywhere
They say that time will dry the tears
But true love burns for a thousand years
Give my tomorrows for one yesterday
Just to know that I could have you here

When will this river of tears stop fallin'
Where can I run so I won't feel alone
Can't walk away when the pain keeps callin'

my eyes all glistening, with the innocence of a blank page,
life is like a blank page, enjoy the beef, the strife, the rage,
wait... let me turn the page and continue to verbally burn the page,

I tend to leave my teachers amazed they never knew my hard work paved the way,
when I talk about back in the days, the hard life, everything will be all gravy,
if I play my cards right, that's right, mother said keep close friends tight,
keep frienemies in the distance, in the night,

Whether you came alone to leave with someone
Or with your crew to party til' the night is done
Do your thang ain't nobody stoppin' you

Leave all your troubles behind
Wave your hands and get live

We revin' up the party act like ya know

ain't no need for fighting or catchin' some kinda attitude
Check that mess before you step in the room
Let it go remember what you came to do
While the D.J. spins it on the ones and twos 
Get busy get jiggy whatever works for you
Whether tipsy or sober that's up to you
But before the night's over I'm tellin you
To enjoy yourself all you need to do is...

A guy that's gonna change my life
And I tell you one day just wait and see
True love is waiting out there for me

[Verse 2:]
I'm like an open book just trying to turn the page
Feels like I'm trapped in a maze trying to find my way
Oh my heart's yearning for someone to call my own
And I don't want to sing another sad love song again

I get so cold summer feels like the winter
And not a full moon of gloom that just cried?
I wish that I could just lie like I'm happy
But I can't hide this hurt inside

[Chorus x2]
But I'll tell you someday I'm gonna find
A guy that's gonna change my life
And I tell you one day just wait and see
True love is waiting out there for me

Take me away, away
Far away, away
Take me away
So far away, away

[Chorus]
But I'll tell you someday I'm gonna find
A guy that's gonna change my life
And I tell you one day just wait and see
True love is waiting out there for me

Can't wait to get it on, he's movin' like he's a Don
Doin' his thing, was shy when he caught my eye
Now, I'd be down to ride, wish I was by his side
Doin' our thing

Fulfill my fantasy, boy, I want you to put your hands on me
'cause you got what I need, look at the sweat all over my body
Tonight you won't forget and you really didn't say nothing yet
So if you like what you see, boy, I want you to put your hands on me

Boy, I've been feelin' you, yes I've been feelin' you, with all the things you do
You got me caught up in a fantasy and I'll do what you want me to do
Whenever you come my way, I wish that you would stay

Yeah, yeah

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Come on, y'all wanna floss wit us
Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Ya slackin on your pimpin, turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

I flex the Rol', sign a check for yo' hoe
Jigga's style is love, X and O
Save all your accolades, just the dough
My game is wide, all lames aside
Tryin to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it
Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up
Multi til I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas
Me and J.D. got it locked crazy
Where you at haters?

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

My cake thick, I live the life
Eatin' crab, watching bitches shake shit all night
I make the big moves, do the big things
Take small groups, turn them into big names
The big dog with the big chain, frostbit bracelet to match
Cats say I'm the shit man
The type of nigga that you need in yo' crew
Type of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do
Get more burn than a candle
Too hot to hold, too much to handle
In the black C-low, he know if she look
She go bye-bye with da-da and I ain't gotta say no mo'
I'm ""The Truth"" like A.I., got the proof and stay fly
In the safest shit you could never buy
Know why?  Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing
I don't know about y'all but every night I swing

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Ya'll shit ain't for real til y'all ship a mil'
And ya hit a R&B chick and she fit the bill
Said she loved my necklace, started relaxin
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
Went from wholesome to Jigga, you awe-some
Baby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey
Platinum, spend your whole life in the day
What's down is a bet, roll the dice

Yeah, yeah, so let's play
So what you went gold and rock a Roley with the ice bezel
It's gon' take a lot mo' to see my level
Where I'm at, your check, you better double that
And personally your raps is where the trouble at
I'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain
In the platinum frame screamin it's not a game
Gleamin, from ear to ear, wrist to wrist, ring and chain
Even me and Jay-Z got it locked, crazy

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

[Verse 1:]
You supposed to be that nigga,
You got a dime on ya side,
(So why you foollin? with me ?),
Listen I ain?t bein? reckless
I?m just tryin? to get this record straight,
(Look what ya doin? to me),
You got me contemplatin? thinkin? maybe,
I should come check you out in that suite,
Pop open some yellow bottles undress me like a model,
Then maybe we could wrinkle the sheets,

But then I know she?ll always be the one you,
Take out show around,
But you continue to hold on to me so,
(Why ?),
Would you think that I could settle for less it?s just
One night no I,
Don?t wanna wake up the next mornin? askin?,
(Why ?)

[Chorus:]
So what I need to know is,
If you?re foollin?,
Only foollin?,
All I asked is (Why ?),
If you?re foollin?,
Only foollin?,
All I asked is (Why ?)

[Verse 2:]
Now the media?s gossipin? pinnin? me in magazines,
Sayin? I was the one,
(No),
Comparin? us to that Brad, Jen and Angelina affair,
Look baby I ain?t the one,
What I?m sayin? is,
I ain?t tryin? to go for that,
(No),
Look I can?t go for that,
(No),
You need find out where your home is at,
And turn the key and range rove it back,

You didn?t want me then so tell me what made,
You changed ya mind
'cause ain?t a thing don?t changed about me,
Tell me (Why ?),
'cause when you say you love me it?s when I?m with
Someone else I can?t help,
You to continue foollin? me,
So tell me (Why ?),

So what I?m tryna? say is
If you?re foollin?,

I don't want to say I still love you 
It hurts me everyday thinking who you were kissing, not me 
Oh na na na na na na, oh na na na na na na 
I'm going to speak the truth, I ain't gonna lie 
I let you go and for the tears I cry, thought we was going down 
Oh na na na na na na, oh na na na na na na 

Hook 
And I'm gonna tell everybody 
Cuz you cheating (gonna tell everybody) 
That you mistreat me (gonna tell everybody) 
Don't leave me (gonna tell everybody) 
So you're leaving (gonna tell everybody) 
I don't need it (gonna tell everybody) 
Don't believe it (gonna tell everybody) 
You deceived me (gonna tell everybody) 

Sitting up in my room I'm lighting candles 
Candle lit my handle thinking why 
Why did I let this situation get the best of me 
When I gave the best of me 
Its just crazy how in a minute we connect 
I was baby your lady 
Sweet city holding hands was your favorite 
Now I, I ain't got no sad song to sing 
Youse dead wrong to me 
Cuz I was thinking a minute but 
Since we separated I knew you would never find 
Find another chick like me that's why I stay up on your mind 
I know its hard for you to hear but I ain't got the time 
I moved on, I moved on, I don't want you now 

[Chorus]

And I'm gonna tell everybody 
Cuz you cheating (gonna tell everybody) 
That you mistreat me (gonna tell everybody) 
Don't leave me (gonna tell everybody) 
So you're leaving (gonna tell everybody) 
I don't need it (gonna tell everybody) 
Don't believe it (gonna tell everybody) 
You deceived me (gonna tell everybody) 

I ain't tripping I'm just saying look at what your missing out on now 
Yeah its going all out now, I'm going all out now 
And I ain't going to cry 
Grab my keys to that Bentley GT, call my girlfriends and ride 
You ain't got nothing on me (Christina's going out to party) 
You ain't got nothing on me 
You ain't got nothing on me 
Really this thing ain't nothing 
You ain't got nothing on me (run and go and tell everybody) 
You ain't got nothing on me 
You ain't got nothing on me

I should've listened to my ladies, when they told me
""Girl, he ain't nothing but a""

You ain't nothing but, a busta
Still I find it so hard to believe, that I touched ya
You should've spent more time doing me, but I loved ya

Actin' portrayin' be something you wanted to be ya whole life, but please
Be easy 'cause it's plain to see

Look there goes another ho, seen her in a video

You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?

It took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
'Cause you broke all your promises
And now you're back
You don't get to get me back

Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Don't come back at all

Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
Tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Don't come back at all

Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?",Jar of Hearts [Official Karaoke Version],

And you knocked me off the ground from the start

You put your arms around me
And I believe that it's easier for you to let me go
You put your arms around me and I'm home

How many times will let you me change my mind and turn around
I can't decide if I'll let you save my life or if I'll drown

I hope that you see right through my walls
I hope that you catch me, 'cause I'm already falling
I'll never let a love get so close
You put your arms around me and I'm home

The world is coming down on me
And I can't find a reason to be loved
I never wanna leave you
But I can't make you bleed if I'm alone

I'll never let a love get so close
You put your arms around me and I'm home

I tried my best to never let you in to see the truth
And I've never opened up
I've never truly loved 'till you put your arms around me

Turn me around
Cannot find my balance
On the ground
This world is too heavy
For a feather falling quickly

And I wrote your story
But I'm afraid of how it ends
And though my friends are doing well
And I'm still on the mend

I'm going to lay back down
Hope the wind takes me around
I gotta find some courage in this town
'Cause nobody's going to save
Somebody who won't change
I tried to be brave

Nothing's coming easy
And all at once
I feel a little queasy
Oh but if you lost my remedy
Won't you please come and be with me

It's not like there's much better
But his grasp is as green as mine
I can't say that I'm satisfied
Three thousand miles from your kiss goodbye

I'm going to lay back down
Hope the wind takes me around
I gotta find some courage in this town
And everybody's afraid
'Cause chances come from change
And everybody's afraid
'Cause chances come from breaking
That chances are you're breaking open

Hope the wind takes me around
I gotta find some courage in this town
'Cause nobody's going to save

Christina Perri,"All my life you know I haven't been very love strong
There's been so many fights that I fought and I never won
So I decided that I should just give up in trying to right your wrongs
And word on the street is she did to you what you did to me.

Five, four, three, two, one
Bang! Bang! Bang! Boy!
Your goin' down, down, down, boy
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
Bang! she shot you.
Karma tastes so
Bang! Bang! Bang! Boy!
Your goin' down, down, down, boy
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
Bang! she shot you.
Karma tastes so sweet

So unfortunately for girls like me there are more like you
Bending and breaking the rules that we're making exceptions too

But how does it feel!
To swim in your own tears!
You lied and you lied
And I died and I died
And now you know why

Five, four, three, two, one
Bang bang bang boy
Your goin' down down down boy
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed.
Bang! She shot you!

My heart isn't black and blue anymore
And your words don't mean a thing
They're sung, in vain

Maybe I was wrong
I only remember feeling so alone

This isn't were I meant to lay down
But you dug this grave
Fits me perfectly

And if you're asking if I'm over love
You're a fool to believe
That you gave me some 

It's been raining here like it never should
And I can't help believe it's because you're coming
If a child wants to run away, and a child wants to hide,
Don't come following your fantasy,
Cause you might be surprised she'll run right back inside

Maybe I was wrong
I only remember feeling so alone

This isn't where I meant to lay down!

This little Bluebird came looking for you
I said that I hadn't seen you in quite some time
This little Bluebird, she came looking again
I said we weren't even friends she could have you

Don't you think it was hard?
I didn't even say that you died
But it wouldn't have been such a lie
'Cause then I started to cry

This little Bluebird sure won't give it a rest
She swears that you may be better than all the rest
I said no oh
You've got it all wrong
If he was something special, I wouldn't have this song

Taking all I want from you again (Oh)

I wish we would just give up,
'Cause the best part is falling.
Calling anything but love.

And I will make sure to keep my distance,
Say I love you when you're not listening,
How long, can we keep this up, up, up?

Please don't stand so close to me
I'm having trouble breathing.
I'm afraid of what you'll see, right now.

I'll give you everything I am,
All my broken heartbeats.
Until I know you'll understand.

And I will make sure to keep my distance,
Say I love you when you're not listening,

Christina Perri,"Two am, where do I begin
Crying off my face again
The silent sound of loneliness
Wants to follow me to bed

I'm a ghost of a girl
That I want to be most
I'm the shell of a girl
That I used to know well

Dancing slowly in an empty room
Can the lonely take the place of you
I sing myself a quiet lullaby
Let you go and let the lonely in
To take my heart again

Too afraid, to go inside
For the pain of one more loveless night
For the loneliness will stay with me
And hold me till I fall asleep

I'm a ghost of a girl
That I want to be most
I'm the shell of a girl
That I used to know well

Dancing slowly in an empty room
Can the lonely take the place of you
I sing myself a quiet lullaby
Let you go and let the lonely in
To take my heart again

Broken pieces of
A barely breathing story
Where there once was love
Now there's only me
And the lonely

Can the lonely take the place of you
I sing myself a quiet lullaby
Let you go and let the lonely in
To take my heart again",The Lonely,2011

More than I told you I was yesterday
Give me a moment to catch my breath
And hold me every second left

Proud of me
That's the only way I want you to be

What you see

I won't make it alone
I need something to hold

Kiss me on my shoulder
Tell me it's not over
I promised to always come home to you
Remind me that I'm older
To be brave smart, sweet and bolder
And don't give up on what we're trying to do

Don't count the miles,
Count the ""I love you's""

We made it out
And all the other people are asking how
This doesn't even sound like truth
To grow from a bruise

But one day we will realize
How hard it was, how hard we tried
And how our hearts made it out alive

Kiss me on my shoulder
Tell me it's not over
I promised to always come home to you
Remind me that I'm older
To be brave smart, sweet and bolder
And don't give up on what we're trying to do

Don't count the miles,
Count the ""I love you's""

And these are words
I wish you said

'Cause you gave up on us in the end

And I won't make it alone

I wish it wasn't always alone

And all you need to know is I'm so sorry

It's not like me
It's maturity that I'm lacking
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know that growing up goes slow.

I wonder what my mom and dad would say
If I told them that I cry each day
It's hard enough to live so far away

I wish I wasn't always cold
I wish I wasn't always alone
When the party is over how will I get home?
And all you need to know is I'm so sorry

It's not like me
It's maturity that I'm lacking
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know that growing up goes slow.

If all the rules are meant to bend
And you swore you were my friend
Now I have to start all over again

'Cause no one's going to take your place
And I'm scared I'll never save
All the pieces of the love we made.

And I'm so sorry, it's not like me
It's maturity that I'm lacking
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know that I can slip and fall

And you won't let me go just to let me know

You keep on passing by
You never land inside my hands
Your home is in the sky
And there's a lesson waiting to be learned
The fire starters always get the best
And the good guys never get the girl
No shooting stars cannot fix the world
And I've made the same mistakes
But I won't this time
No I won't this time

And you're a pretty butterfly
And I believed all your lies
Blinded by your sideways smile
And the kindness in your eyes
But there's a limit to your flight
I can offer you a better life
But you keep on flying from the light
And I've lost my faith in wrong and right
And I've made the same mistakes
But I won't this time
No I won't this time

I know exactly what you do
I made damn sure I studied you
You won't pick me
I'm just a breeze underneath your wings
So I pray each night you'll change your mind
And maybe I'm worth the fight
But I am wrong every time
You only know how to fly

You only know how to fly

Der Tag bricht an
Bald schon ein neues Jahr
Bist deinen Weg gegangen
Bist noch immer da


Und zwei Augen die zurück schaun
Davon eins das vor Glück weint
Und ein Herz das sich errinnert wie es ist im Kampf zu sein
Wenn die ganze Welt auch Kopf steht

Das wird mir alles so egal

Christina Stürmer,"Es war schon dunkel, als ich durch Vorstadtstraßen heimwärts ging.
Da war ein Wirtshaus, aus dem das Licht noch auf den Gehsteig schien.
Ich hatte Zeit und mir war kalt, drum trat ich ein.

Da saßen Männer mit braunen Augen und mit schwarzem Haar,
Und aus der Jukebox erklang Musik, die fremd und südlich war.
Als man mich sah, stand einer auf und lud mich ein.

Griechischer Wein, und die altvertrauten Lieder.
Schenk' noch mal ein!
Denn ich fühl' die Sehnsucht wieder
In dieser Stadt werd' ich immer nur ein Fremder sein,
Und allein.

Und dann erzählten sie mir von grünen Hügeln, Meer und Wind,
Von alten Häusern und jungen Frauen, die alleine sind,
Und von dem Kind, das seinen Vater noch nie sah.
Sie sagten sich immer wieder, irgendwann geht es zurück.
Und das Ersparte genügt zu Hause für ein kleines Glück.
Und bald denkt keiner mehr daran, wie es hier war.

Griechischer Wein ist so wie das Blut der Erde.
Komm', schenk dir ein
Und wenn ich dann traurig werde,
Liegt es daran, dass ich immer träume von daheim
Du musst verzeih'n.

Griechischer Wein, und die altvertrauten Lieder.
Schenk' noch mal ein!
Denn ich fühl' die Sehnsucht wieder:
In dieser Stadt werd' ich immer nur ein Fremder sein,
Und allein.",Griechischer Wein,2014
Christina Stürmer,"Das Leben ist der Himmel
Das Leben ist die Hölle
Du baust dein Glück auf Sand dann kommt die Welle
An jedem deiner Tage
Kann der Wind sich drehen
Und irgendwas gibt dir die Kraft wieder aufzustehen

Woran wirst du dich erinnern?
Woran wirst du dich erinnern?

Und dann schaust du zurück, zurück
Auf das was wirklich bleibt
Wir haben nicht unendlich viel Zeit
Zeig mir was wirklich bleibt

Und dann schaust du zurück, zurück
Auf die Schatten und das Glück
Wir haben nicht ewig Zeit
Sag mir was wirklich bleibt

Mal fühlst du dich als Fremder
Am schönsten Ort der Welt
Mal bist du einfach glücklich
Wenn nur der Regen fällt

Die Zeit nimmt weiter ihren Lauf
Sie zieht dich runter, zieht dich rauf
Aber woran wirst du dich erinnern?

Christina Stürmer,"Weißt du noch deine erste Wohnung?
Die große Stadt du kamst nicht zurecht
Damals war dir alles fremd und jetzt willst du nicht mehr weg
Weißt du noch deine erste Krise? Später hat sie sich ins Glück verkehrt
Und so geht es immer mal hin un her

Dein Herz ist ein Pendel, es schlägt und schlägt aus
Solangs sich bewegt bewegst du dich auch
Dein Herz ist im Wandel und wann immer du glaubst
Du wärst am Boden, zieht's dich nach oben
Lass es noch weiterschwingen es wird dich weiterbringen
Das Herz ist ein Pendel es schlägt und schlägt aus

Weißt du noch deine erste Liebe? Niemand zuvor hat dich so verletzt
Es bricht die ganze Welt zusammen und dann kommt man drüber weg
Wenn es scheint nichts ginge weiter, als wäre der tiefste Punkt erreicht
Geht alles wieder aufwärts und schwerelos leicht, so leicht, so leicht

Dein Herz ist ein Pendel, es schlägt und schlägt aus
Solangs sich bewegt bewegst du dich auch
Dein Herz ist im Wandel und wann immer du glaubst
Du wärst am Boden, zieht's dich nach oben
Lass es noch weiterschwingen es wird dich weiterbringen
Das Herz ist ein Pendel es schlägt und schlägt aus

Zwischen auf und ab und hin und her, als ob dein Leben ein Chaos wär
Verzweifel nicht du findest dein Gleichgewicht!

Dein Herz ist ein Pendel, es schlägt und schlägt aus

Christina Stürmer,"Warum legst du deine Flügel an, anstatt sie prächtig auszubreiten?
Du hälst vor einem Hügel an und könntest drüber gleiten
Wenn du Angst hast, dann verwirf sie jetzt
Denn nichts bringt dich zum scheitern
Du wurdest darauf angesetzt
Den Himmel und die Erde zu erweitern

Volle Kraft voraus, wir sollten uns beeilen
Volle Kraft voraus, zu den Tagen die uns heilen

Sag nicht, dass du nicht sicher bist
Sondern sag,du steigst mit ein
Bis das Maß der Zeit vollendet ist
Sollten wir startklar sein
Straßen und Wohnungen für alle Mitstreiter
Karten für ein Land voller Wegbereiter
Köstliche Belohnung aller Wegbegleiter
Frohe Botschaften geben sich weiter

Volle Kraft voraus,wir sollten uns beeilen
Volle Kraft voraus,zu den Tagen die uns heilen
Volle Kraft voraus,der Himmel hängt an Seilen
Volle Kraft voraus, über unseren Erteilen

Wir können nichts verlieren als den Alltag dieser Welt
Ich kann nur existieren,wenn Babylon fällt
Mehr und mehr wird ihnen Macht entgleiten
Und ein Heer von Soldaten auch
Die Rechnungen, die wir begleichen
Begleichen wir aus dem Wort",Volle Kraft voraus,2015

Christina Tyrell,"Here's the story of a lovely lady
Who was bringing up three very lovely girls.
All of them had hair of gold, like their mother,
The youngest one in curls.

Here's the store, of a man named Brady,
Who was busy with three boys of his own,
They were four men, living all together,
Yet they were all alone.

Till the one day when the lady met this fellow
And they knew it was much more than a hunch,
That this group would somehow form a family.
That's the way we all became the Brady Bunch.
The Brady Bunch,

That's the way we all became the Brady Bunch.

Christina Valemi,"Lejos de todo cuanto amé
En tiempos oscuros vivo hoy sin ti
Pero aun queda un suspiro de honor
Como aliado de este gran amor

Hay un lugar mucho mas alla del sol
Donde mi reino acaba en tu corazón
Donde los sueñós se hacen realidad
Y una leyenda nació grabada a fuego en mi piel

Con la fuerza de mi corazón
Why el coraje de un amor sin fin
Me armaré un dia de valor
Y volveré a conquistar lo que perdi

Con la fuerza de mi corazón
Lucharé hasta recuperar
Cada instante que pasé sin ti
En el destierro de un lejado adiós

Cuando la noche llega sé
Que esa luna que brilla para los dos
Marca el destino que sera
Y en tus labios siempre escrito esta

Que hay un lugar mucho mas alla del sol
Donde mi reino acaba en tu corazón
Donde los sueños se hacen realidad
Y una leyenda nació grabada a fuego en mi piel

Con la fuerza de mi corazón
Why el coraje de un amor sin fin
Me armaré un dia de valor
Y volveré a conquistar lo que perdi

Con la fuerza de mi corazón
Lucharé hasta recuperar
Cada instante que pasé sin ti
En el destierro de un lejano adiós

Mil ilusiones rotas sin razón
Son el legado de la envidia why el poder
Pero la esperanza nunca muere porque sé
Que te llevo muy dentro de mi, en mi

Con la fuerza de mi corazón
Y el coraje de un amor sin fin
Me armaré un dia de valor
Y volveré a conquistar lo que perdi

Con la fuerza de mi corazón
Lucharé hasta recuperar
Cada instante que pasé sin ti
En el destierro de un lejado adiós

Con la fuerza de mi corazón

Volveré a conquistar lo que perdi",La Fuerza De Mi Corazon,2003

A la que quería de verdad
Una princesa que andaba a dos pasos

Y a sus pocas ganas de acertar

Donde los malos tiran y dan
Y siempre hay alguno con porquerías
Siempre hay un día que levantar

Vienen despacio y nunca los ves

So disconnected

You know just what I need

as long as I
Can hold you near
It's gonna be alright
Won't have no fear

I pray for strength, hope and faith
For love to lead the way

Ready for the blood and ready for the honey 
Ready for the winnin', ready for the bell 
Lookin' for the water from a deeper well 
I found some love and I found some money 
Found that blood would drip from the honey 
Found I had a thirst that I could not quell 
Lookin' for the water from a deeper well

I did it for lust and I did it for hate

To the bottom of a hole of a deeper well

Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 

I rocked with the cradle and I rolled with the rage 
I shook those walls and I rattled that gage 
I took my trouble down a deadend trail 
Reachin' out a hand for a holier grail 
Hey there mama did you carry that load 
Did you tell your baby 'bout the bend in the road 
'Bout the rebel yell 'bout the one that fell

Christine Dente,"Joy at the start
Fear in the journey
Joy in the coming home
A part of the heart
Gets lost in the learning
Somewhere along the road

Along the road
Your path may wander
A pilgrim's faith may fail
Absence makes the heart grow stronger
Darkness obscures the trail

Cursing the quest
Courting disaster
Measureless nights forebode
Moments of rest
Glimpses of laughter
Are treasured along the road

Along the road
Your steps may tumble
Your thoughts may start to stray
But through it all a heart held humble
Levels and lights your way

Joy at the start
Fear in the journey
Joy in the coming home
A part of the heart
Gets lost in the learning
Somewhere along the road
Somewhere along the road

Christine Dente,"The touch of your hand will let me know
You take me in and let me go

Christine Dente,"In the deep of the dark, you fell in as the heart
Of your world went down in flames
To a cauldron of pain, seeing no way out

And as you walked through the fire
Losing even desire it was like a dying swan
To look at you then but look at you now

You have found a new lease on life
A stronger step and a curious calm on your face
That you wear as if to say

You can rise from the ashes again
You can rise to the morning that breaks in your eyes
For what looked like your heart's demise
Has turned out to be a blessing in disguise

It has worked for the good, like you heard that it could
But it was hard, so hard to believe
Standing among the ruins of a dream

But from here looking back, you can see clearly that
You can gain from things that you lose
And learn many ways by many means

You have been an inspiration to me
And all the volumes of hope your revival can speak
Will always say to me

You can rise from the ashes again
You can rise to the morning that breaks in your eyes
For what looked like your heart's demise
Has turned out to be a blessing in disguise

You can rise from the ashes again

Christine Dente,"Where there is love there is a peace 
And in the cages that bind the bitter heart it is release 
Hold it close to your chest, let it move and let it rest 
For it is here to set your mind at ease 
Where there is love there is a peace. 

Where there is hope there is a dream 
To rise above, to remit and to redeem 
To go back, to go where there's no hurt or anger there 
To find the song that you once could sing 
Where there is hope there is a dream. 

Where there is faith there is a chance 
To alter the course and fight the winds of circumstance 
Not to scar, but mend, not to break, but to bend 
And not to know but to understand 
Where there is faith there is a chance 
Where there is hope there is a dream. 

Where there is love there is a peace...

Christine Dente,"He said good bye to the angels of heaven
And He came to earth as a common man
He taught us how we could love one another
There was healing in His hands

There were those who believed and followed Him
And there were those who wanted Him dead
They thought the grave would silence Him forever
But they found out instead

[Chorus]
You can close your eyes
You can say it's a lie
You can stick your head in the sand
You can turn away even try to explain
He was just another man
When they nailed Him to the cross by His hands and feet
And the put Him in the ground
Three days later everybody found out that you can't
No you can't keep a good man down!
No you can't keep a good man down!

I hear you say that it all sounds crazy
It's a good story but it can't be true
How could a man who was dead and buried 
Mean a thing to me and you?

Here we are two thousand years later
And still the choice is just the same
You can say that you don't believe it
But it doesn't change a thing

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I can take you to the hill
Where they hung Him on a cross
I can take to the empty tomb
I can tell you He's alive 
'Cause He lives in me
But the rest is up to you!

Christine Dente,"A mural of memories moves by in a blur
His prayers all seem unanswered and unheard
His pleading petitions, his loud cries and tears
A last reprieve will simply not appear

So ruthless He loves us, so reckless His embrace
To show relentless kindness to a hardened human race
The joy that was before Him
On the Man of Sorrow's face
And by His blood he bought a violent grace

Most willing of victims, and with His final breath
Destroyed the one who holds the power of death
The hate heaped upon Him, scorning all the shame
But all for love He died and overcame

So ruthless He loves us, so reckless His embrace
To show relentless kindness to a hardened human race
The joy that was before Him
On the Man of Sorrow's face
And by His blood He bought a violent grace

In all of time no one had ever heard
And to the world the thought seemed so absurd
Beyond their wildest dreams no one could ever tell
Of a high priest who would sacrifice Himself

So ruthless He loves us, so reckless His embrace
To show relentless kindness to a hardened human race
The joy that was before Him
On the Man of Sorrow's face

Christine Dente,"These are my sidewalks
They wounds around the neighborhood
Always led me straight and safely home

But now they're uneven
'Cause roots move beneath them
And time won't leave well enough alone

And I had been trying to smooth these stones
Thought I could make my way alone

I tried the whimsical
Gauzy pink dresses
That spin in the wind when you twirl

But somehow the princess gown
Never did fit this girl
So I fled the garden for the tower

And I had been hiding behind these stones
Thought I'd be well enough alone

Then you came nearer
You held the mirror
I saw myself there in your eyes

And I had been running
Still you pursued
I watched you move each heavy stone

The thorns around me torn our skin
But you kept coming through
'Cause you won't leave well enough alone

To be a part of the conversation
Living in a bigger story
All this time was a history-in-the-making
I was headed for a destination
To take my place in the bigger story

So I listen in and I hear the song
From another country and I sing along
And I play my part as the story goes
And the difference that it will make
Is a tale yet to be told

How far did I travel 'til You let my life unravel back home to You?
How much did You give until I finally got a glimpse of what love can do?
How far, how much and just how long did You wait for me?

I will always stand in wonder
How Your love for me could be so strong
And I will never really understand the kind of love that lasts so long?

How far would I go to show I love You so, I wonder
How much would I suffer for the sake of Your sweet name, I don't know
How far would I go and just how much would I give for you?

Christine Ebersole,"You can pull all the stops out
Till they call the cops out
Grind your behind till you're bend
But you gotta get a gimmick
If you wanna get a hand

You can sacrifice your sacharo
Working in the back row
Bump in a dump till you're dead
Kid, you gotta get a gimmick
If you wanna get ahead

You can uh, you can uh
You can uh, uh, uh
That's how burlesque was born
So I uh, and I uh
And I uh, uh, uh
But I do it with a horn

Once I was a schleppa
Now I'm Miss Mazeppa
With my revolution in dance
You gotta have a gimmick
If you wanna have a chance

She can uh, she can uh
She can uh, uh, uh
They'll never make her rich
Me, I uh, and I uh
And I uh, uh, uh
But I do it with a switch

I'm electrifying
And I ain't even trying
I never had to sweat to get paid
'Cause if you got a gimmick
Gypsy girl, you've got it made

All them uh and them uh
And them uh, uh, uh
Ain't gonna spell success
Me, I uh, and I uh
And I uh, uh, uh
But I do it with finesse

Dressy Tessie Tura
Is so much more then demurer
Than all them other ladies because
You gotta get a gimmick
If you wanna get applause

Do something special
Anything special
Do something special
Anything special

You're more than just a mimic
When you got a gimmick
Take a look how different we are

If you wanna make it
Twinkle while you shake it
If you wanna grind it
Wait till you refined it

If you wanna pump it
Pump it with a trumpet
Get yourself a gimmick
And you too can be a star

Christine Ebersole,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,1999

Christine Ebersole,"I don't believe in frettin' and grievin',
Why mess around with strife?
I never was cut out to step and strut out.
Give me the simple life.

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant.
Those things roll off my knife,
Just serve me tomatoes, and mashed potatoes,
Give me the simple life.

A cottage small is all I'm after,
Not one that's spacious and wide.
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside.

Free from the care and strife.

Christine Evans,"Don't walk away
Until you hear me say
That I knew I had lost you
Don't hit the floor
Until you want no more
There's nothing left for me to lose

Close your eyes
And I will wait here for you
Til hopes are dreams and dreams are reality
Close your eyes
I will worry for you
Til pain and sorrow go away
I would walk the distance
Not speak but listen
Cause I'm always missin you
But all in all you catch me when I fall

With heaven high above
And hell below
I whisper so they'll never know
There's a darkness that creeps
Inside us all
Will the angels still come to my call?

Close your eyes
And I will wait here for you
Til hopes are dreams and dreams are reality
Close your eyes
I will worry for you
Till pain and sorrow go away
I would walk the distance
Not speak but listen
Cause I'm always missin you
But all in all you catch me when I fall

How I see it in your eyes
Through the truth and through the lies
I promised you we'd make it through
I promised you there's more for you

So close you eyes
And I will wait here for you
Til hopes are dreams and dreams are reality
Close you eyes
I will worry for you
Til pain and sorrow go away

Christine Evans,"I can't remember
The last time I felt love for you
I hate pretending
That all those things I said were true

So let me go, let me fade
Let me just spread my wings and fly away
Let me run, let me leave
Let me just be the one that I wanted to be

It seems so funny
When you're the one that's laughing
I hate to hurt you
Cause you're everything I should want
That I should be

So let me go, let me fade
Let me just spread my wings and fly away
Let me run, let me leave

I'm alone here no fear
Safe by the lone

See my pain through all the lies
In this room I wish I'd die
Though my tears I do not cry
Take me home

Is this the end
You messed up had bad luck and take it out on me
You reprimand me, my choices, the voices, the way I live my life
I pray to the angels stand by me, beside me
Protect me from pain and the darkness around

But I'm feeling that it's not okay
You say you don't know her
But I'm hearin' its a different way
You know I always thought you loved me
'Cause you told me it was so
Well I thought I knew the difference
Between hopes to lose
And lies and truths
But now I know they're all the same

Chorus
I'm trying to pretend that this isn't real
I'm trying to comprehend how you make me feel
I ask myself is this what I really need
I'm begging on my knees cause you make me plead
Just figure it out
'Cause time's a wastin' so quickly
But I'm tired of you
I need some time for me

Reachin' for the sunshine
In the corner of my cold dark room
Its there but won't be mine
So I guess I'll have to call back soon
So I tried to find the answers
To just what did I do wrong
But I came back empty handed
Cause I just can't win
I'm lost in sin
But now I know that nothings worth this

I'm on the edge
I can't pretend
That I've got it figured out

It's not the end

Your door I did knock, mom said you were not there
Expensive cell phone, I'm rackin' up my bills
You're never at home, why do I wait here still

Can't you see that you made me believe that
I could stay here forever with you
I keep on falling, wait for your calling
Do the things you knew I could do

Chorus:
Didn't you know, why couldn't you see
I thought you'd be waiting there for me
I wanted to run, I wanted to scream
I couldn't 'cause love made me believe

Pardon for asking, but I've just got to know
Could be the last thing I hear before I go
I took the good things, I'll take the bad things too
I stand here waiting, doing what tough girls do

Can't you see that you made me believe
That something there was still burning in you
I close my eyes and jump from the sky
And put a little of my faith in you

Could you see inside yourself
The things I saw in no one else
Put a little faith in me
Could you believe

On the back of a matchbook.
I don't think that I could've looked in you in the eye.
So fearful of what I might ignite.
But I kind of hoped you'd stayed.

I was barely home a day, plotting my escape
With a dartboard and a blindfold.
But the dart she landed shy, nearly taking out your eye
As you walked passed the window, singing,

Baby please. Don't you go.
Bound to choices, bound to hopeless solutions
Holding terrors unaddressed.
Where's your sense of misdirection?
Left clinging to the shreds of self respect.

Would you do it all again, the same way as the first
Set of second chances.
A stronger one might still crumble underneath the weight of doubt
And still decide to run away.

Holding terrors unexpressed.

All thrown open am I.

Shot straight from the sky into your heart.
When slings for your limbs and a breaking fall
Are all you need.

Paper thin.
Turning over and over again.

(intro)
I've been around the world
And I Yi Yi
Don't know why people
What?
Why people go to the strip club
To spend their dough 
Just to see butt
To see these ladies strip
And take off all their clothes
I do not know why
They choose such a spot
I just don't know why
We get hot
It's probably cause 
They make it hop and twurk the pole
And their headlights are sitting bold
Makes it look like its getting' cold
Can I hold you tight
Hop on my lap
And do that dance
I come to spend ones and huns
On lovely skin
Booty weighs a ton
Let the game begin 
Cause here I come

(Verse 1)
Teccanina swope down like space invaders boy
Pull out the piece like on you haters boy
Forget about the haters 
I don't want to talk about 'em
On this right now
I want to talk about
That butt them breasts
Yes yes want to test
Now sanity stops
When the fannie g. drops
Fantasy locked
On makin' the canopy rock
Panties be hot
When we walk in
All vanity pops
In every glam if she's stocked
Make her make it
Frantically hop
We're all at the tittie bar
VIP and all of the kitties
Are sittin' with me
They're all knowin'
Who we are
TECHN9NE, baby
How you doin'
What you drinkin'
Caribou
Is what I'm thinkin'
Kansas City, baby
Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo,
We got relish
Don't be jealous
That's a hey no, no,no
Me and my fellas
Travelin' lookin' for them
Who does what
Make it hop
In Houston, Texas
ATL, California
Whazzup

(Chorus)
Bianks with breasts and big butts
Here I come baby
Enough to make the big bucks
Here I come baby
151 and Malibu rum and pineapple juice in
My cup
Here I come baby
Fellas in the front
Let me hear you grunt
Fellas in the back
Watch that booty clap
Ladies in the middle
Let me hear you sizzle
Yell
TECHN9NE is hard as hell

(2nd Verse)
Catch me on the couch
With two stouts
Mouth to mouth
Bounce to the techno festival
See lots of lezbo
Lets go ghetto
Or heavy metal
We slam dancing
Blair witch raves
In the woods
Up in Cameron
Rollin'
Diggin' the private schoolers
St. Theresa's bishop Hogan
Those are the kind
That do ya

What ya'll doin' after this scat
With this back activist mack
Blasphemous acts
Hit em with a stack
That will distract a bitch
All I want to do
Is hit the back of this black abyss
In the cat in the hat for risk
If you really want to master this
Know it's a whole lotta cash to get
Me and my homeboys
Will get with
Your homegirls
And get in our own world
We gotta be ready
To get up and go
To the bedroom 
Or up in the bathroom
Givin' me and my homeboys a show
Baby get low
To a TECHN9NE tempo
Do you know
What you're in for
Rough sex
Much sweat
Enough flesh
What's next
Make her say
Oh la la la la
Give it to me TECHN9NE
You're the best time
That I ever had
Give it to me papa
Hit the na na na
And oh oh oh oh yeah
I love it when you do me
Like this teccanina
And I like it
When you make it do that
In Kansas City
We scan the tittes
And brand sadities
Were handsome hippies
Who land some quickies
We comin to kick it
Where you from
Pirates come screamin'
Yo ho ho
151 rum bitch

Christine Kane,"I've never been to Texas
Never been to Ohio
Never really thought about it
Never cared to go
I thought I'd end up in the North
In some apartment downtown
But I'm living here in Carolina
Guess I'm a Southern Girl now

Now the lady down the street
She got a hundred thousand dogs
They're just about the ugliest of things
You ever saw
They crap right in the road
And then they chase me in my car
And when there's nothing else to do
I watch them humping in the yard

Cuz I'm a Southern Girl now
Yes I'm a Southern Girl now

I go to the diner
where the waitress calls me ""Hon""
And the vegetable is macaroni
And it's overdone
Just load me full of sweet tea
Til my body starts to shake
And I won't even ask
What is a Chicken Fried Steak

Cuz I'm a Southern Girl now
Yes I'm a Southern Girl now

Well, yes I'll play you ""Freebird""
It's a sacred holy hymn
Your rebel flag is lovely
And the south will rise again
That woman on your mudflaps
In her silver silhouette
My friends and I agree
Our breasts look just like that

Now, feminism isn't gonna
Make it big out here
So all you little ladies
Get this message loud and clear
It says right in the bible
It's your husband you obey
And you'll call it ""family values""
When he joins the kkk

Cuz you're a Southern Girl now
Yes you're a Southern Girl now

Well, yes I'll play you ""Freebird""
And I'll let you sing a part
And I love Jesse Helms
With all my Ache-y Break-y Heart
Those ten foot tires on your truck
Well mister they are huge
The car you drive is so endowed
I guess you must be too

(Asheville version:
Those ten foot tires on your truck
Will give us quite a view
When we go back and forth and back and forth and back and forth...
On Patton Avenue)

I guess you sense my sarcasm
I guess I'll tell you true
I think your truck is ugly
I think Jesse Helms is too
And I have eaten grits
Although they taste like styrofoam
And it has been suggested
That I ""might-could go on home""

Yes I'm a Southern Girl now

Christine Khalili-Borna,"Something always brings me back to you.
It never takes too long.
No matter what I say or do I'll still feel you here 'til the moment I'm gone.

You hold me without touch.
You keep me without chains.
I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love and not feel your rain.

[Chorus]
Set me free, leave me be. I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity.
Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be.
But you're on to me and all over me.

You loved me 'cause I'm fragile.
When I thought that I was strong.
But you touch me for a little while and all my fragile strength is gone.

I live here on my knees as I try to make you see that you're everything I think I need here on the ground.

Christine Lavin,"Oh, Johnny and Janie, they were the perfect married couple
But not in bed
Oh, they tried taking drugs, How-To books, even Dr. Ruth
But for all intents and purposes their love life was dead

'Til one day Janie went over to the Pink Pussycat Boutique
She bought a long cylindrical thing
Now Janie is smiling, Johnny is not
Every night you can hear him sing

He says, ""Our love is bein' kept alive by artificial means
You've grown emotionally attached to that little pink machine
Our relationship is not as healthy as it seems
'Cause our love is being kept alive by artificial means''

Oh, Johnny went down to the barroom
He bought one drink, he bought two, he bought three
Oh, he moaned to the bartender, the state of his married life
Bartender said, ""Hey Bud, just listen to me''

So Johnny went over to the Pink Pussycat Boutique
He bought a plastic blow-up doll
Now Johnny is smiling, Janie is not
She is angry, she is jealous, she's appalled

She says, ""Our love is bein' kept alive by artificial means
You've grown emotionally attached to that poly-ethylene
Our relationship is not as healthy as it seems
'Cause our love is being kept alive by artificial means''

Wires

Switches

Batteries

Plastic

Tufts of artificial hair

Who'd ever think they could replace the love
(Love)
Humans used to share?
(Humans used to, humans used to)
(Humans used to, humans used to)

Then one fateful day those batteries died
At the same moment that, that big doll sprung a leak
Johnny looked at Janie looked at Johnny looked at Janie
Oh, they both found it difficult to speak

I wish I could say they threw those contraptions away
And fell in love all over again
But Johnny taped up that hissing woman
When Janie stole the batteries from his Sony Walkman

Because their love is bein kept alive by artificial means
They've grown emotionally attached to those modern sex machines
Their relationship is not as healthy as it seems
'Cause their love is being kept alive, love is being kept alive
Love is being kept alive by artificial means

Christine Lavin,"Do you remember that song by Janis Ian?
The one where she complains about
Not getting chosen for the basketball team?

Her song went, ""For those whose names are never called
When choosing sides for basketball""
Remember that depressing song?
I would have written about that but she did it first

When you're 5 foot 2
Okay, 5 one and a half
And everybody else in the whole gym class
If 5 foot 3 and even taller, it hurts

Truth is I hadn't thought about that for years
But then a recent phone call rekindled all those fears
""A softball game "", Robin said, ""And you're invited""

Softball? Great, that's my game
Why softball's practically my middle name
I'll be right over I said, feeling excited

Even though I can't throw, I can't hit
I can't run, I must admit
I can't catch, I can't pitch
In softball I have not found my niche

But I don't let details get in my way
Team sports, ooh, that's what I loves to play
I got dressed, got my sneakers tied
Made it to the park in time for choosing sides

Pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, ooh
Pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, ooh
Glove? Sure I own a glove
But it's in the repair shop with my rugby helmet

But I can always borrow from the other team
Pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me
Pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me

This part goes on for a long, long time
Because 20 people showed up to play and they picked 10 to a side
So as the ranks of the chosen grew and the unchosen we depleted
I tried to act nonchalant

'Cause deja vu, I was the last one chosen
Even after the overdressed Felicity Rosen
Do you know her?
She was wearing high heels

Stockings with seams and those Lee stick on nails
And they picked her before me
They put me in the field so far out and to the right
I was practically out of sight

But everybody said, I had a real good day
I didn't make any errors, I didn't make any plays
You see, the ball never came out my way
And I figured it's just gonna be one of those days

Now, coming up to bat was a whole new kind of humbling experience
I took one swing and missed, that was no surprise
I took another swing and missed, that was no surprise
Then I practiced strategy, I let one go by, the umpire called it a ball
I had a proud moment

Then the pitcher figured me out
He threw one I just couldn't resist, I swung and I actually hit it
But it was a pathetic little dribbler that went
Bloop, bloop, bloop, right back to the pitcher

Who threw it over to first and I was out which again is no surprise
But as I was walking to the bench to pick up my borrowed glove
To captain of the other team said to the captain of my team
""Hey, she really doesn't know how to play so let's not count her outs""

Not count my outs? Not count my outs? What are you talking about?
I want you to count my outs, I want my outs to count
Which made me unpopular with my entire team
So I said, ""Don't count my outs""

What a great idea and it makes me feel so special
Thank you for being such a sensitive human being
And thinking of my needs in such an open
Kind and generous way

I really said something like that
I was babbling like an idiot

Well, eventually I resumed my place in the outfield
And continued watching the dandelions
Grow and blossom and turn into puffs
And blow away in the chilly wind

I continued watching the clouds making ugly formations in the sky
And it wasn't long before I began to question my worth as a human being
And my reason for living

But then top of the seventh
Two on, two out, a crack of the bat, a mighty clout
My whole team turned and cringed to see
That speeding ball heading vaguely toward me

I ran as fast as I could, I said a prayer
I stuck out my glove, the ball landed in there
No one could believe it on either team
They hooped and hollered and stomped and screamed
And total strangers clapped and cheered

(Aware that God had performed a miracle here)
I was carried to the bench, I was handed a beer
Then the clouds broke apart
Then the sun reappeared

No, it didn't, but it felt like it did in my heart
I wanted to live again

Oh, by the way we lost that game 17 to 3
But I considered it a moral victory
And Janis Ian, wherever you might be
Take heart, there's hope for you 'cause there's hope for me

Take me out to the ballgame, take me out to the crowd
Buy me some peanuts, I'll buy you Crackerjacks
As long as you count my outs when I come up to bat

Now it's root, root, root, root, root, root for both teams
Win or lose, lose or win we're all the same

Oh, won't you please take me out to the old ball game?
Come on, please take me out to the old ball game

And life is making you lonely

Forget all your cares, and go

Some little places to go
Where they never close, Downtown

Before the night is over

The lights are much brighter there

Forget all your cares, and go

Forget all our cares, and go

I don't like the opera
But he loves the opera
And I love him
I follow the libretto
I follow the conductor
When I follow the plot
My head begins to spin
I don't understand a word
Even when it's English
Everyone around me says
This is divine
I don't like the opera
but look I'm at the opera
It's a good thing 
He can't read my mind.

(Yes, he's a wonderful Parsifal
and she's the best Tundra I've ever seen)

Look at me I'm skiing
When I do not like skiing
But he loves skiing
And I love him
I rent the boots and poles
I shiver in the cold
I'm charging down the mountain 
Risking life and limb
There's no exhilaration 
I am only feeling terrified
Everyone around me's having
Such a great time
I do not like skiing
But look at me I'm skiing
It's a good thing
He can't read my mind.

(Yes, exhilarating is just the very word 
I was thinking of... scared of heights?
Oh no, not me)

I am not complaining 
I'm just making observations
Expanding your horizons 
Is a sign of maturation
Now I tolerate cigars
'Cause he's a smoker
I'm playing chess
Though I confess
Sometimes I long for poker.

I am eating sushi
When I do not like sushi
But he loves sushi
And I love him
I'm poking with a chopstick
At a living breathing fish stick
Oh my God!
I think it's trying to swim
Some say eating sushi 
Is like chewing on your own cheek
Or sucking down a bucketful
Of tentacled slime
I do not like sushi
But look I'm eating sushi
It's a good thing 
He can't read my mind.

(Yes, this is a very interesting texture
What is it? Ohhhhh....)

So if you see me in the sushi bar
See me in the mezzanine
See me on a ski slope
Looking scared
Hey don't feel sorry for me
I must be in love
Why in the hell else
Would I be there?
Before I met him life was dull 
I never took any chances
Now I leap at every opportunity I find
I do not like sushi
I do not like skiing or the opera
Maybe I will in time
Maybe I will in time

Christine Lavin,"The reality of me cannot compete with the dreams you have of her.
And the love you've given me is not as sweet as the feelings that she stirs.
And so you turn away and you say that you're sorry,
But you must pursue this dream, this improbable dream.

Though things have not been bad, you can't say you've had
Quite as good a time as it first seemed.
The reality of me is not what you write love songs about.
You'd rather be longing from afar; 

You're not as comfortable with love as you are without.
And she's a thousand miles gone, and that's fine,
'Cause you're fond of the shimmer distance brings to these things.
And tonight when you sleep you'll keep dreaming of the love

And the happiness you're so sure she will bring.
The reality of me is probably much like the reality of her.
By the time you find this out let's just hope I've recovered from the hurt.

And you're longing for the love that we once knew.

He's closing in on forty, look at those eyes
He's searching for something, he can not describe
He's not unhappy, he's not satisfied

He falls in love with covers of slick magazines
With serious actresses on the screen
All are unattainable except in his dreams
Where his heart and his soul reside

'cause he is afraid of attainable love
Afraid it will envelop him, swallow him up
All of his life he has resisted the tug
Of attainable love, attainable love

His dance card is full, he's so much in demand
He get's nervous when his partners try to hold his hand
He's got to keep his options open, he's that kind of man
The girls he cha-cha's with never understand

They wonder if he's gay but the truth is he's not
He just won't settle for whatever it is he's got
They want to Tango, he want's to Fox Trot
Don't even think about the can can, he can't can't

'cause he is afraid of attainable love
Afraid it will envelop him, swallow him up
All of his life he has resisted the tug
Of attainable love, attainable love

Add me to the list of women
Who think you'll be different with me
Add me to the list of fools
Who flatly refuse to see that just like me

He is afraid of attainable love
Afraid it will envelop him, swallow him up
All of his life he has resisted the tug
Of attainable love, attainable

He is afraid of attainable love
Afraid it will envelop and swallow him up
All of his life he has resisted the tug
Of attainable love, attainable
All of his life he has resisted the tug
Of attainable love, attainable love

All of his life he has resisted the tug

Christine Lavin,"Back in the 1850s this town just teemed with life
150,000 Miners all were dreaming of a strike
7,000 live here in Castlemaine
And he still works for the mines
Extracts 2 grams of gold per ton of sand
Dust the gold rush left behind.

I met him on a November Day 
The Australian sun was bright
He squinted his eyes
He lit a cigarette
Another rough night.
The house he shared with his wife and babies
He had built with his own two hands
He could no longer call it home
In his place, another man
So he lives here with a friend of his
His wife lives down the street
They joke that it's a halfway house for men
Suffering temporary defeat
He makes me a cup of coffee 
I notice his young (bud) weathered hands
Tanned except for where it was he wore a wedding band.

He askes me about America
A place he would love to be
He's been all over Australia
He's seen all there is to see
He shows me pictures of Ayers Rock
Wild Birds and Kangaroos
Pictures of his little ones
And his wife too
Then he said put out your hand 
And I will give to you what I found on a recent trip
He lays in my palm a mound of multi colored opal chips
When his fingers touch mine 
I feel a longing from within
Did that originate from me or from him?
But it's 4:00
He leaves for work
He returns home late that night
I'm in the room right down the hall
I can hear him snap on the light
I hear him softly humming
I hear a turning of a page
I dream that night of wild birds trapped inside an opal cage.

In the morning when I get up
He's in the kitchen making tea
He smiles and he says he's got one more parting gift for me

I tell them what she said to me 
I figure they'll think I'm some kind of babysitting genius

Ten years ago

In the middle of Vermont
The hills were covered with Christmas trees 
And freshly fallen snow 

Instantly I picture the vivid details of that day 
When you told me that you loved me more than you could ever say
The air was a bracing cold
The sky a startled blue 
Never before or since 
Have I felt that close to you

What does that say about you and me and the last ten years 
I've learned to live with your silence
You've learned to overlook my tears

Has me questioning the basis for the life we live today

Flying with the angels

Christine Lavin,"I dropped a token into the slot.
Pushed through the turnstile.
There was a woman at the end of the platform
Waiving her arms around, kind of wild.

""Come here,"" she wailed. ""There's a puppy on the rails.
I think it has been hurt.""
I raced down to where she was pointing 
to see a ball of fur covered with dirt.

""It must be dead,"" I said to her,
as I turned to leave.
""No, it's alive,"" she cried. ""Just before you got here,
I swear, I saw it breath.""

""And I'll watch for the train if you'll jump down.
Pick him up and hand it to me.
If we take him to the vet, if we save his life,
Think how wonderful that'll be.""

I looked into the tunnel, there was no train in sight.
I looked at the furry thing lying there, a truly pitiful sight.
""Look,"" I said. ""I'm not sure that's a puppy.
Could be a lice-infested, long-haired rat.
And it's gotta be dead, so I'm not jumping down,"" 
and I figured that that was that.


But by now more people arrived on the platform, and she said,
""Help. There's a puppy on the tracks.""
They looked for a moment, and like true New Yorkers,
collectively turned their backs.
She said, ""Somebody's gotta do something,"" 
As we slowly turned around again.
""Someone must have the courage to save him.
It's a puppy. It's man's best friend.""

""Trains come through here every few minutes.""
Said a man wearing madras pants.
""And it's way too dangerous. You'd have to be nuts,
to take such a foolish chance.""
But the woman was insistent. ""In the time we've been debating,""
She said ""One of you could've jumped down.
Handed him to me, by now that puppy could be 
at the animal shelter cross town!"" 

We felt bad, but no one would do it. 
Then a transit cop appeared.
Down at the other end of the platform
We all yelled ""Hey you! Come here!""
He ran to us, I pointed to the train tracks and said,
""See that thing, furry, not to big.
What do you think it is, he looked and said,...

""What? You mean that wig?""

We stepped back. A rush of embarrassment swept right through the crowd.
Accented by the blast of a train whistle,
Approaching and growing quite loud.
The ""be	"" train flattened that furry thing.
We got on board, went on our way.
Grateful that we did not risk our lives 
to save a life of a wig that day.



So if you see something on the train tracks,
Take a tip from me.
Don't let anybody talk you into saving it,
It's best to just let it be.
And if you see a person wearing 
what looks like a puppy on their head,
Don't call the police, it's only a wig,...

Don't tread on me,
My heart's not stone,
You'll never take my dreams away.

What good are wasted tears today.

In between a thousand lies,
When it cuts until it bleeds,

Be on your way,
What good is wasted time today.

",Forgiveness,2004
Christine McVie,"
Long ago
Before the moon was young
And before the first love song
Had ever been sung
We both knew
Beyond a shadow of doubt
What loving somebody
Was really all about

When the sun goes down
And you are not around
I'm sailing on a prayer
Don't you know
I told everyone
I even told the rising sun
That I really need my friend

When the sun goes down
In this sleepy little town
All the world keeps spinning
And the planets turn around
All alone
Lonely as the stars
Well I just wanna be
Wanna be where you are

When the sun goes down
And you are not around
I'm sailing on a prayer
Don't you know
I told everyone
I even told the rising sun
That I really need my friend

When the sun goes down
And you're not around
I'm sailing on a prayer
Don't you know
I told everyone
I even told the rising sun
That I really miss my friend

After the storm
And you gave me strength darlin'

For all that you gave me darlin'
You wanted nothing in return

That's why I'm givin' it back
Givin' it back, givin' it back to you
I am givin' it back
Givin' it back, givin' it back to you

When there was doubt
You gave me faith
When there was emptiness all around me
Well you know you filled that space

That's why I'm givin' it back
Givin' it back, givin' it back to you
I am givin' it back
Givin' it back, givin' it back to you

When you feel it
Why don't you pass it along
And then you'll never, no never, never go wrong

So I tripped and I fell
I got lost for a little while
But you caught me in your loving arms
Rescued me with your smile

That seems to come down from long ago

When something flies by their window
It might be out on that lawn
Which is wide, at least half of a playing field
Because there's no explaining what your imagination
Can make you see and feel

Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

Now it's not a meaningless question
To ask if they've been and gone
I remember a talk about North
Carolina and a strange, strange pond
You see the sides were like glass
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any man's ever made that land
Then I think it would've showed

Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

They say there's a place down in Mexico
Where a man can fly over mountains and hills
And he don't need an airplane or some kind of engine
And he never will
Now you know it's a meaningless question

From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

They feelin you, Crae, it's cool, I'm respected, but I won't be a slave to acceptance
I got my co-sign from the master, so maranatha

But still I let em tempt me, and show me what I'm worth
But none of then can solve my problems or my hurt.

Just to touch your face
As the distance between us disappears
In the final hour I’m in search for the time
Just to capture this moment of forever
A thousand words later
The picture is worth so much more
And I know that I just can't explain myself

To genocide in Darfur
To miscarried children, blood pours on the parched floor

All I do is tweet about it, lol hashtag
The new J's is coming out?
Oh I gotta grab that
But get that wisdom out my face and show me where the cash at

Said that I'm a king already but not yet

I don't need to understand it, I just know that I'm free
Freedom from the Holy One

And it breaks my heart to see you fall away (fall away)

But what about the church that the world views?
They see a perilous voyage into the Dead Sea for some pearl-less oysters
In other words it's pointless
They don't understand that this ain't nothing to toy with
They don't understand why we don't give up and join 'em
They don't understand how some of us were appointed
Some of us, cuz some of us are dealing with the sum of us
Not as equal as some say, son

I tried to tell 'em, they eyes would well up
But they some modern day Hellen Kellers
Only go by what they feel, Lord help us

Yeaaa, breaks my heart
To see us focusing on things that will pass away
Clever distractions

This illusion is tragic
We focused on amusing the masses
But can't see that the center of attraction is all in vain like blind heroin addicts, its all a dream
Unwise settle for hat tricks
My heart cries when airs pulling out rabbits from they might 
As white lies turn to black magic
And destruction results from distraction
Did the folk of the cloth trade mirrors and smoke for the cross?
If so we hope its lost
The hocus pocus that we know that's in the culture will fall
If our eyes ain't on the King then our focus is off, its in vain

I don't even know why I'm signed to a record label with an audience
'Cause nobody in CHH a superstar
They see Lecrae go crazy
But I don't wanna swim in the mainstream
Life guard, you better come save me
It could be a long way down, maybe

Told myself to please stay strong
But she stayed long and the DJ's going
She ain't going home and why?
I wanna say bye
I wanna get away
Don't you think of me and her
She can't go
And please stay close
And you know how it goes
And ahhh
Gotta say bye
Gotta get away

Man, why this always gotta happen to me?
A song of a siren caught my iris
Slow wind from her island just crashed into the
Coastline and Poseidon attacks the new me
You know she know she bad, Mike Jackson-ily
And she just wanna thrill a man
Then a hand, scribbling off of the wall
Started with:
Dog, really she just wanna kill a man
Hope floats boats
But when Gilligan’s on the wheel again
And he’s fiddling with demonic riddles on that Ritalin
And the minnows in sin
In the wind
Like in the willows and spinning like ceiling fans
You just need to heal her man
Absolutely!
She just wanna share my light, I stole that line from an ab-soul loose leaf
Hold it Gray
I know the pain
Tryna be the holy homie protege
Then I sank in the ocean
And can't swim good
Frankly, this overdose on Novacain hurts the feel
Abba, Father, shouldn't but I wanna got a wife and daughter
Water water all around me
Yet the thirst is real
I’m praying
My eyes closed, I’m swangin'
Aiming for the fence but the game is dangerous
And the King stayed hanging
Save him
Show em how Nothing was the same then

Shouldn't, but I wanna

Shouldn't, but I wanna

I go Deebo with my way up from a kilo on that step
Tell the death, yeah I mean the death, let that pistol talk
You say truce, me speaking no english, bitch go get some heart
Fuck the law, nigga fuck the law, they can see me too
Fuck a school, and the teacher too, they don't teach the truth
What's a pops, never had a pop, let that ratchet pop
I'm too real, gave a fiend a pill for a Magnavox
Man fuck we got, fuck we really got, but this gutter shit
All my niggas hug the strip and all my bitches love to strip
So suck a dick, I got kids, and a baby mama too
Yeah she work my fucking nerves like a baby mama do
I be stressed, I be hella stressed, smoke a bunch of weed
High for real, pop the pill and drop the Xanny in my lean
I can scream, cause you just smile like everything is fine
Hope is fun, when I grab my gun, come take your life or mine
Suicide, yeah it's suicide, life is suicide
Fuck your right or wrong, the shit that I been on is do or die
If I do I die, if I don't I die that's suicide
Got the devil with a gun against my brain like choose a side

I love the hood with my whole heart
It whole heartedly been a part of me in my own thought
Process so I digest through my own art
That I'm blessed though I digress due to slow starts
But who else could bring the hood out
And tell 'em when they let God in, it brings the good out
Learn a lesson and listen
My current composition concerns your present condition
And turn direction envision of givin' blessings and wishin' you well
Well wishing and tales fishing
Siftin' through hell's kitchen to find good
Have a God-like mind as the divine should
Define good within yourself I think the time's good
And may these lines live forever like a line should
It's a war going on and your soul fighting
So frightening within you I see thunder and both lightening
Boat striking, snow ice and hail
Your whole life unfold like, cold nights in Hell
In a mode like, you're feeling low like, like you don't like yourself
You got no sight, no insight
No foresight, that's the shit that your foes like
Run up on a nigga get 'em froze like
Put the 4-4 to his foes like
Niggas 'bout to take a pic, trying to get the pose right
Red dot, headshot, hit 'em close like
Like, like all theses niggas I've got to shoot one
Fuck one pistol I'm cocking two guns
Fuck shoe money, I'm coppin' coupes son
No y'all niggas not 'bout to do none
Guns, that's a way of life, get money not God
You got guns, we got bigger guns, go get one and I ride
If I die, they say I went hard, I go super hard
Bitch you with this shits or not? We gon' get this loot or starve?
Fuck you doing? Writin' in a pad, fuck you making songs
What you rappin', boy you know what's happ'nin', that shit take too long
Fuck you mean? Get this fucking cream, get this fucking cream
Hug this block, tote this fucking Glock, can't let these suckers scheme
Shit too real, shit too fucking real, I'm too real to dream
So when it's this cold world won't feel a thing

Christoph Andersson,"'Cause I'm in love with these Tumblr girls
With skinny waists and drug habits
Pretty faces love status
She acts as if she's the baddest
Man I swear she's just like tons of girls
She expects the free drinks
And I'm successful she thinks
Always comes around when weed stinks
We fuck off and on, off and on
Only ever really fuck off and on
Never see her these days 'cause I'm often gone
When I'm home off tour never stop for long
Back this week from across the pond
Noticed I was close to the block she's on
Elevator to the floor her loft is on
Drinking whiskey, she likes Vodka strong
But after we fuck it's over
Walked out the door, that's closure
No I can't stay here and hold her
Tomorrow act like I don't know her
Wouldn't ever be here sober
Can't tell which one is colder
My clothing's on, we both did wrong
I gotta go that's what I told her yeah

Uh she said she can't feel her face (she said she can't feel her face )
Yeah right now I can't feel my heart (right now I can't feel my heart)
Ugh for your feelings there's no place (for your feelings there's no place)
Yeah but you knew that from the start
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last (never last)
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last (never last)
Meant to die, we moved fast and then we crashed (then we crashed)
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last

She's fine as fuck and she knows it
Sexy body she shows it
Loves the drama she chose it
She draws the line then she blows it
The most fun I suppose it
Pops a bottle won't close it
Fills a fifth then she throws it
She pops a bar now she's dozing
She's hot and cold, hot and cold
Homie I don't know she's hot and cold
Truly the bullshit has gotten old
Superficial with a rotten soul
Fucking off and on, always stop and go
Probably got someone, choose not to know
Head to her place then we lock the door
Making bad calls when I'm off the blow
'Cause she's a bitch, I'm selfish
Want every girl, can't help it
And it's tough for me to shelf it
It's you I see myself with
Right now I know you felt it
I touched her then she melted
We shouldn't chill but we do it still
Gotta play the hand if you dealt it yeah

Uh she said she can't feel her face (she said she can't feel her face )
Yeah right now I can't feel my heart (right now I can't feel my heart)

Missing everything you say
It's not important what you stand for
You're asking will he be the one, I'll be gone before you're done tonight
Waiting for another day

Ich geh heute aus, hab ich mir gedacht
Und mein Herz das sehnt, sehnt sich so nach Liebe
Plötzlich steht er da und sagt leise Hallo
Schaut mir in die Augen, ja ganz einfach so
Und ich spüre nur, diese Gefühle

1000 Fantasien durchlebe ich in meinen Gedanken
Es ist wie Magie, doch heute Nacht passiert es nie

Flieg, flieg, flieg nicht so nah ans Licht
Träume sie verbrennen, wenn ein Flügel bricht

Flieg, flieg, flieg nicht so nah ans Licht
Engel fallen tief, wenn ihr Herz zerbricht

Er nimmt meine Hand, mir wird kalt und heiß
In mir brennt ein Feuer doch ich weiß
Ich will einfach mehr, ich will wahre Gefühle
Dann der erste Kuss, draußen wird es schon hell
Ich bin wie verzaubert, doch das geht mir zu schnell
Und mein Herz es warnt mich vor diesen Gefühle

I don't see the bad boys tryin' to catch some play...

'cause I love your smile
I love your smile

The clock at work says three
And I wanna be free
Free to scream, free to bathe, free to paint
My toes all day
My boss is lame you know, and so is the pay
I'm gonna put that new black mini on my charge anyway

'cause I love your smile
I love your smile

Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
I can be a better girl with love you give
You rock my world
You dig

Believe in a girl
like me
Shanice is the one
For you to be with

But when I'm caught
All alone
I start fessin'
It's from a state of depression
And the thunder clouds of doubt move in
I begin to wonder ""Do you still love me?""
But after that
My whole world is beautiful

Christoph Spendel,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Each night before you go to bed my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
And tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love
(love can never be exactly like we want it to be)
I could be satisfied knowing you love me
(and there's one thing I want you to do
especially for me)

Le cœur en apnée un trésor qui vaut de l'or

Mille et une nuits perdu d'avance
Mille et un jour perdu d'amour

D'un grand oiseau, allegro moderato

Quand le soir ouvre le bal

Joue avec le feu
Sans éteindre ma vie joue encore

Sans rendezvous, là, d'un seul coup

Et dans ce cœur à cœur 
Notre amour fou se meurt 
Se meurt

Comme des enfants, on jette des mots 
Au fond de l'eau 
On sort, on veille 
On s'émerveille 
Les mois défilent 
C'est plus fragile 
On s'accapare 
Nos rires s'égarent 
Sans écho 
Sans écho 

Le courant t'emporte
J'ai beau te serrer fort 
La vie s'acharne encore 
Nos corps qui se balancent 
Du mors, je contredanse 
Et dans ce cœur à cœur 
Notre amour fou se meurt 
L'amour fou se meurt",Océan d'amour,2016
Christophe,"Elle ressemble à un portrait de Norman Rockwell
Derrière les traits usés on devine qu'elle était belle
Y a encore dans ses yeux comme une p'tite étincelle
Signe de vie et d'amour, un don tombé de ciel
Juste là pour elle 

C'est une vielle dame toute seule
Qui serre son sac tout contre elle
Il contient toute sa vie, ne voyage qu'avec elle
Il renferme des trésors qui font figure de cire 
Des instants sublimés qui l'aident encore à vivre 
Dans ses souvenirs 

Elle regarde le monde actuel
Avec sa myopie jamais cruelle
Comme dans un portrait de Norman Rockwell
Norman Rockwell 

Elle n'attend rien de la vie
Elle lui à tout donné puis repris
Elle préfère l'univers Norman Rockwell
Norman Rockwell 

C'est une vielle femme toute seule 
Qui ne parle qu'à elle-même
Qu'achète toujours deux places, dans les trains qui l'enmènent
Une pour son compagnon qu'a quitté cette terre
Un fantôme adorable sortant d'une aquarelle
De Norman Rockwell

Elle regarde le monde actuel
Avec sa myopie jamais cruelle
Comme dans un portrait d'Norman Rockwell

Elle n'attend rien de la vie
Elle lui à tout donné puis repris
Elle préfère l'univers Norman Rockwell

C'est une vielle dame toute seule
Qui serre son sac tout contre elle
Inoffensive, peu pressée, que le bon dieu l’emmène 
Y a encore dans ses yeux comme une p'tite étincelle
Elle ressemble à un portrait de Norman Rockwell
