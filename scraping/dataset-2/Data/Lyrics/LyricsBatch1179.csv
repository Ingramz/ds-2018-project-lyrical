The Starting Line,"When you left home and moved to Ohio 
The summer had come to an end. 
My best friend goes, I try to follow,
Running as you disappear. 
Stay. 

You know how bad this hurts. 
It's been three weeks and just gets worse. 
Come back to PA. 
Forever this time. 
Greg's last day is our last chance to be best friends 
Until we say ""goodbye"" and ""I'll try to see you when the weather clears. 

Then I went home and prayed that tomorrow 
You would turn the car right back around. 
Evergreen Rd just won't feel the same, 
Since your gone.

The Starting Line,"Don't leave me without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye

You and I, cold February night
It's been a half an hour 
Taking sweet time saying our goodbyes 
One minute more, go!! 

The best day of my life is all thanks to you 
Precious remembrance saved for rainy days on February 
Few scenes from my life where moments mean more to me 
Than our fine nights, 
I remember like yesterday, the time of my life 

Please don't leave me without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye
Please don't leave me without saying goodbye 
Without saying goodbye
Lets travel back in time

Two-twelve-ninety nine at the stroke of midnight 
Holding you tight, your body and mine, in February 
Few scenes from my life where moments mean more to me 
Than our fine nights, 
I remember like yesterday, the time of my life

The Starting Line,"Looking in your eyes, I see a paradise.
This world that I found is too good to be true.
Standing here beside, I want so much to give you this love in my heart that I'm feeling for you.
Let them say we're crazy.
I don't care about that.
Put your hand in my hand, baby, don't ever look back.
Let the world around us just fall apart.
Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart.
And we can build this thing together, stand in stone forever, nothings gonna stop us now.
And if this world runs out of lovers we'll still have each other.
nothings gonna stop us, nothings gonna stop us now.
I'm so glad I found you, I'm not gonna lose you, whatever it takes to stay here with you.
Take it too the good times, see it through the bad times.
Whatever it takes is what I'm gonna do.
Let them say we're crazy.
What do they know?
Put your arms around me, baby, don't ever let go.
Let the world around us just fall apart.
Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart.

All that I want to do is hold you forever, forever and ever.",Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now,2001
The Starting Line,"So it's safe to say that we've been here before;
Heart torn out, down for the count and still come back for more.
This lesson is learned too well.
Though, only unlearned by the time your wounds have healed.

Have you had enough?
I guess not because your lips are stuck to his.
It's Time to say enough is enough, you would be so better off.
You love him but tough because it's not coming back from him.

You can't win.
Stop expecting change, he's just a lost cause that you're waiting on.
Take a look around, you could have anyone.
So leave undeserving him.

It only hurts at first.
But then you will find someone to give you everything you want.
Try not to go running back to him.
So it goes unsaid that we've been here before.

Lonely nights and endless fights and sleeping on the floor.
And he's sorry, so the story goes.
It's read and replayed and ends the same way
Stop expecting change, he's just a lost cause that you're waiting on.

Take a look around, you could have anyone.
So leave undeserving him.

On my face and on my wall 
Where all her pictures fall. 
Getting over a three leaf clover, That I thought was four. 
It's just the same as before. 
Forget me, girl, I'm still recovering from her. 
It hurts so. 
I'm sorry, girl, I'm in no shape to love. 
It's not you its her. 
An absent-minded find 
Was thought to be a lucky break, 
But what's at stake is only dignity. 
Alone I'll stand as they all dance. 
I've tangoed one too many times, The floor is just not for me. 
Forget me, girl, I'm still recovering from her. 
It hurts so. 
I'm sorry, girl, I'm in no shape to love. 
It's not you its her. 
So take it slow, even stop 
Every now and again when I say when. 
Here we go on our way to sudden change. 
Turn the tables to point the other way. 
And I'm dismayed. 
And if I stop breathing keep your arms around me. 
Forget me, girl, I'm still recovering from her. 
It hurts so. 
I'm sorry, girl, I'm in no shape to love.

Countin' flowers on the wall
That don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire till dawn with a deck of fifty-one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me I've nothin' to do

Last night I dressed in tails, pretended I was on the town
As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down
So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doin' fine
You can always find me here, I'm havin' quite a time

About the years ahead and how they'll be
You'll be living in a world where roses hardly ever grow
Cause all I have to offer you is me
There'll be no mansions waiting on the hills with crystal chandeliers
Then there'll be no fancy clothes for you to wear
Everything I have is standing here in front of you to see
All I have to offer you is me

Sweetheart I'll give you all my love in every way I can
But make sure it's what you want while you're still free

The Statler Brothers,"She was called a scarlet woman by the people
Who would go to church but left me in the streets
With no parents of my own I never had a home
And a eighteen year old boy has got to eat
She found me outside one Sunday morning
Begging money from a man I didn't know
She took me in and wiped away my childhood
A woman of the streets this lady Rose
This bed of Rose's that I lay on where I was taught to be a man
This bed of Rose's where I'm living is the only kind of life I'll understand

She was a handsome woman just thirty-five who was spoken to in town by very few
She managed a late evening business like most of the town wished they could do
I learned all the things that a man should know
From a woman not approved of I suppose
She died knowing someone really loved her from life's bramble bush I picked a rose

Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans

Pulled my ol' har'poon out of my dirty red bandana
Blowed it low while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield whipers slapping time and Bobby clapping hands
We finally sang up every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin', but it's free, so free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Body that was good enough for me, good enough for me and Bobby McGee

From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me, Lord, through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold

Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Searching for the home I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' her body close to mine

The Statler Brothers,"Everything that I see since I moved far away
Only serves to upset and remind me
Of a beautiful girl in a part of the world
That I tried to leave far behind me

Like the girl on the street that I happened to meet
As I was about to walk past her
She looked just like her and my heart felt a stir
So I stopped her and proceeded to ask her

What are you doin' in this part of the world
Oh, forgive me but I thought you were someone else
For a moment you looked like a girl
That I came here to forget but you see I haven't yet
And I won't in this part of the world

Every car on the road's like the one that she drove
Makes me think that she's come to meet me
In this part of the world, just the sight of that girl
Would relieve me and cure me completely

And it happened today in the very same way
When a car just like her's pulled beside me
With a beautiful girl, so I called out to her
""Hello dear, how on earth did you find me?""

What are you doin' in this part of the world
Oh, forgive me but I thought you were someone else
For a moment you looked like a girl
That I came here to forget but you see I haven't yet
And I won't in this part of the world

The Statler Brothers,"We walked the warm streets of Florida with sand in our pockets lots of times
Worked the cold streets of New York with four guitars and a tin cup just for dimes
We spent one night in Winnipeg a summer in Mississippi sun
Had some trouble once in Fargo some bad times in Enceno but we had fun

We made the papers once in Phoenix when we stopped and tried to break up a fight
We hit keno in Reno and lost it all in Vegas the very next night
We hopped a train in Chicago and skinny dipped in San Francisco bay
We checked it all in the big hotels then used the fire escape to get away

And we wouldn't trade it all for the world and all of its gold
It's the past that makes the future worth livin'
Mother Luck's been good to us and we will praise her in our songs
For the good times and the good things she has given

We flew into Kansas City early April 24th without a plane
We got stranded in a snow storm with some girls from Salt Lake City on a train
We spent a week one night in LA looking for a doctor's daughter on the strip
Then we wound up in Nashville pitchin' songs and waitin' tables for a tip
And we wouldn't trade it all...

We were voted the couple most likely to survive
Even teachers never doubted we were more than just friends
But your mama had some second thoughts back then

When you went off to nursing school I kept my job in town
To show your folks that I was old enough to settle down
When you came home for holidays we were happy without sin
But your mama had some second thoughts again

Does your mama know I'm rich and happy well almost that is
Has she ever said that maybe she was wrong
All she ever really wanted was to have the best in you
And that's all I ever really wanted too.

Thanks to her she made me want to prove I could succeed
But thanks to her I'll never have the one thing that I need
And If she reads the papers and remembers who I am
She's probably having seconds again

Does your mama know I'm rich and happy well almost that is

Taught me how to swim and fish and tell the difference between bass and carp
Taught me how to snap my fingers whistle through my teeth oh Uncle Roy
He sure took time to make times good for a little pesty half grown boy
Aunt Kathleen would wash my clothes and blow my nose whenever nature called
Darn my socks and damn the pox but kept me out of school from fall to fall
Gave me movie money though I never did my chores the way I should
To a nasty little nephew Kathleen you sure made aunthood awful good
And Freddy used to laughed to me whenever something valuable got broke
He taught me how to climb a tree about birds and bees and taught me how to smoke
He took me on a first date I was scared to death but he said you'll do fine
Good buddy you're my cousin but you seem more like a brother of mine
But you can't go home to the good times you can't go home anymore
Roy's all crippled up now Kathleen can hardly see
Freddy's off somewhere to fight a war
But you can't go home to the good times you can't go home anymore
Everything has changed and who were there to blame
Gone far that you just can't go home

He did were never done for show
His name was never printed in the paper
Until about two days ago

He only filed a short form for his taxes
No one asked him how he felt about the war
He always had a good word for his neighbor
Now his good words won't be heard anymore

And through the rain, I heard the choir singing
""Nearer my God to Thee""
Through the mist I saw some children crying
And I felt nearer my God to Thee

His table was never full of plenty
His silverware was never the real thing
But the tears on the faces of his family
Were just as real as if he been a king

Preacher said, he'd always been a good man
But preachers always throw that phrase around
But the tears I tasted gave his words new meaning
Watching old friends puttin' daddy in the ground

And through the rain, I heard the choir singing
""Nearer my God to Thee""

And I felt nearer my God to Thee

And the world that used to fall in step
Beneath my guiding hands

The Statler Brothers,"I WANT TO CARRY YOUR SWEET MEMORIES
WRITER LEW DeWITT

I wanna carry your sweet memories to my grave. At last I've broken off the chain Now just a few shoppin' marts from Maine Now and then a little jolt of sorrow hit my mind But after a while I soon forget the pain. And go on with sweet memories of you And find that I can live my life anew And I erase each thought that I might want you back again And I remember all you put me through. I don't wanna' be your servant anymore I don't wanna' be your slave I just wanna' remember all the good times that we shared And carry those sweet memories to my grave. And now I'm free of most the pain And I don't wanna' hurt that way again If I catch me longin' for the way things used to be I just pick up a piece of broken chain. That chain recalls a lot for me I'm reminded how things used to be There's just some things I'd rather not remember about you I just wanna' have sweet memories. I don't wanna' be your servant anymore I don't wanna' be your slave I just wanna' remember all the good times that we shared And carry those sweet memories to my grave. I don't wanna' be your servant anymore I don't wanna' be your slave I just wanna' remember all the good times that we shared And carry those sweet memories to my grave...

And the big bad moon's gonna shine like a spoon

Kick your shoes off mama have no fear bring your sweet self right over here

A little bit tired of it all, she unlocks the doors
And does so much more than what she gets credit for
She opens the mail straightens up without fail

Last Friday evening's mess, she makes brand new coffee
Though her head's hurtin' awfully, by nine she's looking her best
And Monday comes dawning the world wakes up yawning
And Friday seems so far away

But there bright and early Monday morning secretary
You sure do look pretty today, at ten there's a break
She don't always take, just time for a powder and smoke
A salesman comes in, looks her over end to end

And tells her a new dirty joke, she laughs off his pass
Like she's done in the past, she knows all those lines so well
Then at five she goes home to her cat and two rooms
And cries 'cause she's lonely as hell

But too much waters run under this old bridge
And there's too many rivers between me and you
There's too many rivers to cross babe too many dreams have been lost
And there's too many long nights I've turned and I've tossed
And there's too many rivers to cross
Now don't think for a moment I blame only you we both killed the fruit on the vine

She gave her heart and soul to me and more I wanted

Treat her like I treated those before but she loved it and wanted more
Sometimes I lied to make her happy
Sometimes she'd lie to see if I would lie some more

Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

You say that you're an old, old friend of mine
And if I'm wrong about you then I beg to be excused
It's just that I have not seen you in quite a long, long time

Or could it be the bottle that you're holding in your hand
The girl I knew could never be that kind
Please be patient with me, I will place you if I can
It's just that I have not seen you in quite a long, long time

The dimple in your cheek is familiar I'll admit
And the smile does resemble one I've known
And the color of your hair does remind me quite a bit
Of someone within the shade of blonde is not just like her own

Now I must go, it's getting late and I do wish you well
And please go kind of easy on the wine

I've heard it said you killed a lion with your hands
And when the people of Phillistia raised your ire
Ain't you the man who set their fields on fire

You faced an army of Phillistines all alone
And didn't you tear at their flesh with just a bone
So tell me Samson if these things I hear are true
How could you let a woman get the best of you 

I've heard it said you were the best of many men
That you could tear a city gate right off it's hinge
And that the strongest rope just could not hold you bound
And you completely tore one temple down

How could you let yourself get caught in such disgrace
You got the best of every man you ever faced
And after all the mighty enemies you slew
How could you let a women get the best of you

You've battled many a man till he has turned and fled
Then turned around and let a woman turn your head
You loved the best, my man, but you were bound to fall
By the very thing that you loved best of all

Oh Samson it's been said you were a mighty man
And women were your weakness this I understand
But after all the mighty armies you went through
How could you let a woman get the best of you

To lead Your people well

Trading it for mine

And on the way he stopped each day and looked to Heaven and
Asked God for help as he could not withstand the task alone

And if you all obey My rules I'll see you safely through

And said go and tell My children these are My Commands

Thou shall have no gods before Me is My first Command
And thou shall not make any graven image by thy hand
Thou shalt not take My name in vain and thou wilt guiltless be
Remember thou to keep the Sabbath day alone for Me
Honor thy father and thy mother and Thou shall not kill
Thou shall not commit adultery and Thou shall not steal
Love thy neighbor as thyself and show thy neighbor peace 
Covet not thy neighbor's house nor anything that's his

Go and climb that mountain Moses 
Climb that mountain now and pray
Climb that mountain now and tell us

Moses showed these words of God to all the children there
They pulled up stakes and headed out to find the Promised Land
That Moses had described to them and told of comforts there
The children of oppression thought they'd not find anywhere
But they were soon to part from him and push alone awhile
For it was never meant for him to walk that final mile

Showing evidence of a supernatural work of God

Cries a man who could find no room at the door
So they lowered him down on a stretcher bed

Take up your bed and go your way""
And as he walked through the crowd they heard him declare
I can tell you all there's a man in there

""There's a man in here"" the disciples cried
When the ship was tossed from side to side
So they woke Him up as the waves blew high
And said, ""Don't You care that we're about to die""

The Statler Brothers,"It started March of sixty-four
Many years ago
We were hired by Johnny Cash
To open up his show

Four boys, a worn out Cadillac
With a road map on the dash
For the next eight and one half years
We got paid by Cash

He took us down to Nashville
To Columbia studio
Not knowing where we came from
They told us where to go

But Johnny said, ""I like 'em
Don't you give them no trash""
You see, we were Johnny's little boys
And we got paid by Cash

We were there when June became
Johnny's lovin' bride
And we sang to him that mornin'
Our buddy Luther died

And we were there when the son was born
That filled them both with pride
And we were there when John remembered
God was on his side

We watched him on the concert stage
We watched him write his songs
And saw the things we had to do
And the things that could go wrong

And if we had to start again
We'd do it in a flash
'Cause we learned more than we earned
When we got paid by Cash

Then came the time when our career
Demanded that we go
And through some tears we all shook hands
That last and final show

All those years we never had
A contract or a clash
Whatever we may be today
We owe it all to Cash

Like how do I cut a record or get on a country show
Well, it takes more than just ambition and three chords on an old guitar
There’s a few more things you ought to learn to be a country star

You got to learn to sing like Waylon or pick like Jerry Reed
Yodel like Jeannie Shepard, write songs like Tom T
Put a cry in your voice like Haggard, learn Spanish like Johnny R
Whisper like Bill Anderson and you’ll be a country star

Play piano like Ronnie Mil sap or Gilly or Jerry Lee
Yo-yo like Roy Acuff or talk plain like Ralph Emery
Growl like Conway Twitty, get a red, white and blue guitar
Build a swimming pool like Webb did and you’ll be a country star

Be tall like Sonny James is, tell jokes like Minnie Pearl
Or be short like Jimmy Dickens or play five-string like Earl
Get a hip band like Willie, learn to stutter like M-Mel
Get a cap like Roy Clark wore or a voice like Barbara Mandrel

Be rich like Eddy Arnold, say you’re makin' more than you are
Get a gimmick like Charley Pride got and you’ll be a country star

But if you have no talent and you’re not a male
If you’re built somewhat like Dolly or have a face like Crystal Gayle

About the music and the bridesmaids
Huh, I’ll bet your daddy threw a fit
When he had to get dressed up in that tux and tie

And I noticed where your sister came home from Texas
I know you were glad to see her
And knowin’ your mama, she probably cried
But then so did I

So don't seat me on either side
I just came by to see the show
I'm close enough I'll stay right here
I can see and I can hear 
Course I heard it all years ago

I hear the organ play a minor melody
Is that the one they call their song
Church bells always make love sound so easy
But ""as long as you live"" is so long

I didn't come to kiss the bride
Nor come to call the groom outside, No
I can't stay and say hello
That's not the reason I came by
I came today to say goodbye 
To somethin' that happened years ago

I hear the organ play a minor melody
Is that the one they call their song
What God's joined together let no man put asunder
But He sure put us under right or wrong

Give the bride and groom my best
And tell her mom and all the rest
That I was here but I really had to go

My mind let my heart stop and take a look around

No scent of your momma's flowers in the air
With no yellow paint the front porch looks plain and sad
That old swing made me smile bout the times that we had

And I've held it in my hand because well I just wanted to

At a banquet that still won't digest
Watching this years high school heroes
Get awarded for what they do best

There's a letter for the one that jumped highest
And one ran faster by far
One broke the 200 meters
And one broke her arm on the bar

The MDP stole the show
The coach looked scared with the tie on
Swore, next year they'd be 15 and old

And in tomorrow mornings newspaper
There'll be pictures that surely reveal
Young men looking strange with no caps on
And Tomboys in dresses and heels

And I've stood up there where they're standing
And never once thought I would be
Sitting down here where I'm sitting
Looking more like my Daddy than me
Looking more like my Daddy than me

Twenty some years from tomorrow
These same boys and girls will find
An old fading newspaper clipping
Yellow and torn up with time

Their daughters and sons will be standing
Up there where they used to be
And only then will they know what I'm feeling
When they're sitting out here with me

So one takes the bow, one takes the blame

It won't be easy to throw away so many years in smile

The Statler Brothers,"It was the same summer I learned to play
'It Had To Be You' on the piano
The same summer we jumped the fence at the fair
And you won in two throws the pink dog I tried all night to win

There's a storehouse of song titles
I can recite from that summer
I hear one every now and then
It seems I'm always driving when I hear one

I turn the radio up and blank my mind
And let it drift, it's a good thing
I never hear more than one at a time
Or I don't think I could see to drive

I see pictures taken that summer
Every time I give my personal belongings
Their annual cleaning out
Remember the one that was taken
In your back yard the evening of graduation?

You wrote on the back, you wrote
Well you know what you wrote
Or maybe you don't but I do

I still go to the same theater we went to that summer
I always sit about tenth from the back on the right
You always got a headache if we sat any closer
And had to squint if we sat any farther back

You were a lot of trouble to me
Of course I see the same people
We saw that summer
None of them ever mention you

I guess they don't know
I still remember you like I do
Or maybe they do know
I still remember you like I do
Maybe that's why they don't mention you

And the places, the places are still there
Although most of them have changed
That narrow bumpy dirt road up to the knoll
Where we used to park has been paved
And a new housing development has gone in

Houses, cars, and people have invaded our place
Where your innocence became my guilt
People live daily as if nothing has ever happened
On that piece of ground

I've learned other songs on the piano
The fair doesn't come anymore
Until late September
And those songs make me
Sad now instead of happy

The pictures have gotten bent
And corners broken off
They've put on a new wide screen
And swinging chairs in the theater

The people have grown older
And the knoll is a pool of lights after dark
But the summers are still hot and that's the
'Bout the only thing that hasn't changed
Except that I still love you",That Summer,1995

I'll give everything I have to give until the day that I die
There will be days I won't understand but I'm telling you now I'll try

A fairy-tale princess with hearts on your mind
And as long as you need me you'll always need me
That's all I'll need from you
I'll give everything I have to give...

Tryin' hard to figure out my life and what it means
It's not the things I never got the chance to do that matter
It's the things I took the chance to do that matter most to me
I've had a good time had a good life had a good home had a good wife
Had a little rain had a little sun had a little sin I had a little fun
I've been up on cloud nine been down on my luck
Make a few friends made a few bucks
Been fell in love a couple of times I've had a good time
I've had a good time had a good ride sometimes I lost sometimes I won
Wrote a few songs that still get sung I didn't give up and I didn't die young
I've been up I've been down I've been to the wall
But I've been blessed Lord through it all
Even fell in love two or three more times I've had a good time
[ guitar - ac.guitar ]
I've had a good time had a good ride sometimes I laughed sometimes I cried
Sometimes I looked sometimes I touched sometimes I took just a little too much
Well I never look back got no regrets well maybe a few but even yet
I'd love to do it again just one more time I've had a good time

But don't you know you're playin' with my heart
I know you think love is just some foolish game
Well this time I've played the loser's part

It's been years since I've been this close to you
Standing here on the street like strangers when we meet
Oh God knows it's been too long ago

I won't try to lie to you cause time just won't let us
Play the games we once had the time to play
We're both a little older but Lord you don't look it
When you smile I feel eighteen again today
But it's been too long ago...

There are so many things I'd love to ask you
Where you live whatcha doin' your last name
And do you remember the things I remember
Cause a memory minus one is a shame
And it's been too long ago...
Oh God knows it's been too long ago




",Too Long Ago,2001
The Statler Brothers,"I knew she was the one the second I feel in love
Like a pocket on a shirt she fit me like a glove
There's nothing I wanted more than for her to be my wife
But it scared me to think of taking on another life
It was the longest night before our wedding day
I wasn't having second thoughts I just had more prayers to say
I sat there in the church alone asked my father man to man
Can I live up to the promise when I don't know if I can
Well I remember the first bike that I tried to ride
I couldn't ride it no matter how hard I tried
Then my dad told me the secret that I never will forget
He said it's not that you can't do it you just haven't I done it yet
[ guitar ]
After five good years of marriage my promise is still good
Now she wants to be a mother and I'm faced with fatherhood
So I prayed to my father I need some help once again
Do you think I'll do alright dad I don't know if I can
Well I remember the first bike...
He said it's not that you can't do it son you just haven't I done it yet

And mail it right away

Listening to the music that we played
She walked up and whispered
I leaned down and listened
To the request that she made

She asked so sweet and tenderly
""Do you know, 'You Are My Sunshine'
And would you do it one more time for me"".

And ocean to ocean

Look down and see her

The Statler Brothers,"It started March of sixty-four
Many years ago
We were hired by Johnny Cash
To open up his show

Four boys, a worn out Cadillac
With a road map on the dash
For the next eight and one half years
We got paid by Cash

He took us down to Nashville
To Columbia studio
Not knowing where we came from
They told us where to go

But Johnny said, ""I like 'em
Don't you give them no trash""
You see, we were Johnny's little boys
And we got paid by Cash

We were there when June became
Johnny's lovin' bride
And we sang to him that mornin'
Our buddy Luther died

And we were there when the son was born
That filled them both with pride
And we were there when John remembered
God was on his side

We watched him on the concert stage
We watched him write his songs
And saw the things we had to do
And the things that could go wrong

And if we had to start again
We'd do it in a flash
'Cause we learned more than we earned
When we got paid by Cash

Then came the time when our career
Demanded that we go
And through some tears we all shook hands
That last and final show

All those years we never had
A contract or a clash
Whatever we may be today
We owe it all to Cash

We were there when June became
Johnny's lovin' bride,
And we sang to him that mornin'
Our buddy Luther died

And we were there when the son was born
That filled them both with pride
And we were there when John remembered
God was on his side

Now John will tell you there were years
When times were good and bad
But we can tell you they were some
Of the best we ever had

And the Tennessee Three
We were one big happy family
And would have done it all for free

And declared that Babylon would never fall. 
He had concubines and wives, 
He called his Babylon ""Paradise."" 
On his throne he drank and ate, 
But for Belshazzar it was gettin' late. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His houses were built upon the sand. 

Well, the people feasted and drank their wine
And praised the false gods of his time. 
All holy things they scorned and mocked, 
But suddenly all their mocking stopped. 
For on the wall, there appeared a hand, 
Nothin' else, there was no man. 
In blood the hand began to write, 
And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His houses were built upon the sand. 

Well, no one around could understand
What was written by the mystic hand. 
Belshazzar tried, but couldn't find
A man who could give him peace of mind. 
But Daniel, the prophet, a man of God, 
He saw the writing on the wall in blood. 
Belshazzar asked him what it said, 
And Daniel turned to the wall and read: 

""My friend, you're weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
Your kingdom is divided, it can't stand. 
You're weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
Your houses are built upon the sand.""",Belshazzar,2008

Broken homes that He has mended
Those from prison He has freed

I knew that you had a flame in your heart
And under our blue skies
Marble movie skies
I found a home in your eyes
We'll never be apart

And when the fires came
The smell of cinders and rain
Perfumed almost everything
We laughed and laughed and laughed

Crying took me to the darkest place
And you have set fire to my heart

Under a sheet of rain in my heart

But in a goodbye bed
With my arms around your neck
Into our love the tears crept
Just catch in the eye of the storm

And as my heart ran round
My dreams pulled me from the ground
Forever to search for the flame
For home again, for home again

Daddy played the banjo, ?neath the yellow tree,

It rang across the backyard, an old time melody,

I loved to hear the music, I was only five,

I listened as his fingers made the banjo come alive.


Sometimes I?d wake up at night, and hear a distant tune,

The banjo would echo, ?round my childhood room,

I?d sneak down the back stairs, Daddy never knew.

I?d grab a broom and make believe, I was pickin?, too.

--Chorus--

One day Daddy put my fingers down upon his fist,

He picked it with his other hand, we made the banjo ring;


Now the music takes me back, cross the yellow day, 

Soon the summer?s with my Dad, and the tunes he made.

--Break--

But I?m just tellin? lyes ?bout the things I did,

See I?m that banjo player who never had a kid,

Now, I sit, beneath that yellow tree,

Hopin? that a kid somewhere, is listening to me.


Daddy played the banjo, ?neath the yellow tree,

It rang across the backyard and wove a spell on me,

Now the banjo takes me back, through the foggy haze,

With memories of what never was, become the good old days.

I give a fuck who's who
I chef the same when I'm preparing it
From bad kid to semi-rich middle-aged American
Rooted in my heritage, wounded for the derelicts
The root of every evil is the truth of all appearances
I crack the sound but the beat is still a barrier
And every fucking inch of every street around this area
The Venice carry us up like dough rises
Rap transit all city, no license
The city is beneath, I watch it from a bird's eye
Brain dead, two left, they shot me in my third eye
Shot out my eye like ? on a Christmas day
Reach for pistols as I watch the fuckin' Pistons play
I set the tone with the writings on the wall
The city cleans it up like we inviting 'em all
Evolution's all messed up now, chop the middleman
Stab the messenger, not the literal
I ran without a cause and was the best before I knew shit
Before I took a cruise ship, before I been to Houston
I ain't tying up loose ends I let 'em waiver
Pulling out these lavers and pounding out the pavement
Gone

I be a young motherfucker of the rap camp
Style symbolizes my nastiness like a tramp stamp
Wamp wamp, where it's at
Fear fact, just let them legends die and I'll inherit that
I'm fit for the carry, weight of the world I carry on my back
With a fairer sack, inquisitions to the mirror
Exactly what niggas fearing, see the future in it's clearest

Until an icon, I choke your life like a python
I'm who the children look up, probably got 'em doing kush ups
Super high, call me Superfly, bitch I'm Jimmy Snuka
Got you feeling like you took a hit of heroin
And that's for veterans, the way I bury 'em, embarrassing
You know better than puttin' that fire near the kerosine
I said don't make me tell again like kids with speech impediments

Roll the credits, roll the medics
Getting high till I feel I'm copacetic

Yo I've been trying to keep it silent, my tendency to violence
The suit and tie be fading, the truth about the shining
The sliding through the masses, smiling eyes through glasses

But fuck that though, I want a ho that stay up late
My dirty bottom bitch to fuck with me until the wake
Mad illegal C.R.E.A.M, ain't no rules, that's the dream
In regal swimming pools prepping tools for future schemes
Laying low and creeping it, selling dope and sleeping it
Wrap the dough up in a rope, keep in what I'm sleeping in
Mattress fettucini, life's a flick and I'm Fellini
Pinky diamond rings above the rims of ice martinis

In Vegas too playing Miles Davis Bitches Brew
Same day but the wish is new

Life of a gambler
I play my hand with candor
Tip the vic dancer
Lit the cancer
Kiss the tarantula
Switch the pamper
It's banter
Glitz and glamour
Whip the Fisher
No need to shift the Phantom
The tandem
Male enhancement
The sex is tantric
Perfect the gambit
Protect the King
Play the harem
It's heaven
Roll the seven with discretion
Impressive
The necklace
Make the peasant toss the lettuce with the French Dressing
(I walked in the Casino)
To add the jet to the collection
Fresh glass of nectar the refreshment
Popped a mescaline in like a breath mint
Benevolence
Diamond elements
Million dollar rhetoric
Remy Martin spill on the carpet
Twist pelicans in crisp garments
Triple lemons, Prince charming
The fire army discharges
I pay the lawyer, beat the charges
The energy is harnessed

I'm not a little dumb new fuck, the Usual
Suspects become clientele, thread 'em through the needle
Or the high of it, decided whether ever felt the Beatles
A believer till they label me a dreamer
Went from popular to sittin' on the bleachers and slangin' these
I am the truth, it's a planet dream
I ain't the mover, I'm the man that you hand the cream
The students starvin' till we packin' out the Garden
If we fall short of House of Blues, pardon

Carvin' out our images

On the table, ropes thicker than them ski lift cables
Talk slick, I'll connect both of your lips with staples
Like a mummy rap, but this is straight dummy rap
Not Easter Bunny rap, don't sleep on the paper
Or take money naps, I race on the track like Ricky Bobby
Spit it sloppy, my profession's videography
I'm high definition, 1080p description
Flipping like things that flip
Don't read off a script, heavyweight, I make the needle skip
Crush 'em like a fuckin' Dorito chip, then move on to the next
Lava burns heavy on the decks
Middle finger stretch, triple X, words that I stretch
Make it impossible for me to catch a breath
Move faster, telecaster, coming out the ghetto blaster

The Step Brothers,"Yo, could it be I stayed away too long?
Lighting up to Cypress Hill I was the side of the bong
Catching arthritis my pen was the heaviest
Bars trapped in a cell, run on sentences
Cleanse my readiness, my pencil is deep
I might erase every beat until it sends me to sleep
Send for the heat without relational guns
Send for weed drinking Jamaican rum
I only run between the moon and New York city 
With a crew that get busy like Bizzie be winning
And in the night still pitching like I’m in the first inning
Curve spinning these curtains are swervining
Disturbing images I cover the scent another visual
I mask and still never repent
Event the tide from the pull of the moon
From where I currently reside where its currently June
And kind of worry how my currency views
Kind of murder don’t mind if I do

My grandma and your grandma sitting by the fire
My grandma told your grandma, ""I'm gonna set your will on fire""
Talking 'bout hey now

Cake is duffel the biscuits buttered
Placed in covered the steak is smothered
Monetary notes growing ropes homes on boats
That’s why every step I take is brothered
Step I fly off the handle to create my supper
As an OG told me a closed mouth doesn’t get fed
Push the level over the red
Pushes under my blankets they know to spread
Like butter and jelly over the bread
I’m on my alchensteam Toot-Toot!
Runaway train blowing his steam from out them things
That resemble a stove top kettle. Hot metal on schedule
I bust but your but macla rasto seco
Like the chamber make my vocals that go that go that go

From the moment that the ladies screamed me at the cheering
From the tone of the rain seemed so appealing
Did not invent the money printed but I’m getting it
Did not invent the wheel but motherfuckas spinning it
I’m not the paranoid searching for my calling yo
Straight out the barrio one baritone of audio
I carry on listen I carry on tradition
I took a toothbrush to old kids and pairs of blissen
So fuck this place and a staircase to sit in
In a city where you need a flashy car just to fit in
I never tried to make it I was only trying living
Claimed in on math but mothafuckas never give it…
Up sick of giving I got nothing to show
But ain't sick of being sick with it it’s the sickest you know

I don’t communicate with conversation
I stay up late nights in the basement
Charge extra for installation
Chop up loop like little bits of bacon
While I operate on a patient
Laboratory coats is what I’m draped in
More than the money notes my music is my motivation
Uh burn nicotine blow out Listerine
Lincoln to Michigan live from the coffee bean
And TV’s depiction is off bring in the green leaf
Too many Indians that want to be chief
I’m confident with my spot nobody can ounce me
As a youth my parents figured out they couldn't house me
Some even made me try to play the sideline and couch me
Now they stand at attention every time they announce me
Success is my revenge
You throwing pebbles in the wind
I send messengers with a pen
More medicine with the blend

Caps are what I never type
Bought when I’m stepping out
Stack till I get it right
Red state blue state politics bang
The day is new same shit different game
Been running ink to tunnel vision
Maybe it’s the night
So I’m waiting till the sun is risen
Some forgive some forget the summer debt
The summer time some will regret
Some of the bets win more then its less
I keep pressing till the vinyl breaks
Vital mistakes are at a viral rate
The eyes had it till they expand or dilate
I’m on the fire escape off the highest of flames
Debating science hearing sirens and things
I start my movement view to the stars
And start grooving pointing tools at mars
Licking shots from my union
I catch the plot when I clue in
I caught a permanent and never been removed since…
Bitch, bitch

There is no pot of gold at the end of a mythical rainbow

The president is the host, the results are painful

And hope I'm hanging on
Now I'm stuck here singing no I don't belong
But we were wrong
We were wrong to get involved
Now it's all our fault
It's turned into something we don't need
But I didn't know
What shame it was and it's all my fault
I know I said somethings that I don't mean
Let go
Tell me why cause I don't know
The reasons that you had to go
The reasons that you said goodbye
Come back
I may be down but I'm still intact
And holding on I can't look back
Does it make you wonder why
How could I be so blind?
I spent last summer waiting
Waiting for a chance
Last in line but I got no patience
The only thing I learned
I know you won't return
And I'm still stuck here singing no I won't be heard
Everyone is staring at me now
But it's not the same

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I won't know sweet music until you return some day

Pouring in my heart, causing tears of pain.

Like beautiful sunshine, that makes the flowers grow.
 
You're my sunshine, loving you is my dream
When I'm with you, I hear bluebells ring
And the beauty, only you can bring
Keep me smiling, my heart's filing away
Memories of a life with you 
Take me with you, I'm the one who's 
Gonna lift you, to your Shining Star.

You are my light, when dark days do appear
Bringing me sunshine
My heart has no more fear,
Birds in the air, they even sing your name
Spreading love's rainbow--an everlasting flame.

The Stone Coyotes,"The last thing I remember
Before they brought me in
Was whispering through trembling lips
""Take a message to my kin""

After that the only
Recollection I have
Is tracing with my fingertips
A faded photograph

I was out on the Black Atlantic
Clinging to the mast
(Sails tattered on the mast)
Praying on the windswept deck
That this ship is built to last
Calling, Crying, Shouting out your name

They say that once you've been there
You are never quite the same
My nerves are shot to pieces
I've been waiting here in vain

A ghost got in the looking glass
Who is that I see?
A shock of recognition
That poor lost soul is me

Since that night out on the sea
No keepsakes do I have
Just the thought, the dream of you
And a salt-stained photograph

Now I walk these paper streets
And all the buildings sway
The tides that shift beneath my feet
Are going to carry me away",The Black Atlantic,2000

I met a man, he was walking
Down this long and lonesome road
He said, ""I have a heavy pack upon my back
And no way to lighten the load

I don't know where I'm going
But I sure know where I've been
I work all day and half the night
Get up and do it all again""

She had fallen to her knees

The Stone Coyotes,"Through a field there ran a brook
From the hills beyond
Where a boy put down his book
And from me now is gone

I am reminded of him here
Where rain on heather falls
The pages scattered on the banks
Since first he heard the call

""Arise, arise, and come away
You are our pride and joy
The drums shall roll and the pipes shall play
For our highland boy""

He sailed on ships and loved a wife
Children played upon his knee
He read the story of his life
That told his destiny

And when in Death's cold eyes he looked
He bravely faced the foe
And through his heart there ran the brook
He followed long ago


And so we laid him to his rest
We laid him gently down
We heard Scotland's bonnie drums
And there was glory in the ground

The field shall be his blanket warm
The stars his diadem
The hills shall stand his honor guard
And the pipes his requiem",Highland Boy,2000

The Stone Coyotes,"As I walked out in lower Manhattan
A girl I chanced to pass by
Something about her caught my attention
Something hard to identify

She carried a suitcase through the streets of the city
And shivered with cold in the thin coat she wore
She said, ""Look at my face - it used to be pretty
Now I'm old and I'm twenty-four.""

Romeo and Juliet when we began

He liked to mix his powders and potions
Bought in the alleys away from the light

Falling in love with the dangerous kind.""",If You See the One,2000

Way out in the wilderness, a cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness, a cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That's hangin' on the wall

Your brain is a bleedin' and your legs can't seem to stand
Your brain is a bleedin' and your legs can't seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That you're holdin' in your hand

There's seven breezes a blowin' all around the cabin door
There's seven breezes a blowin' all around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean's pounding roar

There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance
There's seven new people born

The Storm,"Aight, new drink
One part Alizé, one part Cristal
Thug's Passion, baby
Y'all know what time it is
This drink is guaranteed to get the pussy wet and the dick hard
Now, if you with me
Pour a glass and drink with a nigga, you know what I mean?
I ain't tryin' to turn you all niggas into alcohols, alcoholics
I'm just tryin' to turn you into motherfuckin' thugs
So come and get some of this Thug Passion, baby

I could pull out the drink and be good until it's relevant
But I'm a straight soldier
I'll roll up a nigga like it's Heaven sent
Tripping over dead presidents
They got these derelicts
I throw was down with this business
Trying to clown and get a cent
And so rather than stand forever, been thinking
Drinking over a felony
And hell of me and how it will be some other shit
People telling me to cool out
But they ain't feeling me
A motherfucking fool, about
My fucking cheddar cheese
And it pleases, passion of mine
Thugging, hugging plenty of G's
And laughing while I pass through times
And all these bastards be watching
Just keep it plain
And I'mma keep it the same partner, just take it the simple game
I can pinkle with the rain twinkling
Diamonds and things go blinking
Enough to hold me, til I'm old and wrinkling
And these adversaries
They gonna have to be worrying
'Cause I'mma be illing, fulfilling my passion
Til I'm burying my Thug Passion

I heard it's the bomb
And you got it going on
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby
You got me dripping wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby
Ooh whoa

Now what if me
Turn this Hennessey into a robbery
The Prophecy probably suddenly
Switch and how it supposed to be and dirty money
Can't be evil 'cause it's filling up my tummy
Born in a position, death collision was futuristic
Twisting riches but there is only one way to make more
So I'm standing on the corner
Trying to hustle in the snow and my bigger bro
Couldn't know, but buy a .44, blasting at playa haters wanting more
With a Thug Passion

Putting down mashin'
Control by this Thug's Passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blasting
I'm asking what happened
To the niggas who kept it real
Like they claim to
That's when I bang, do, see thang true
Travelling this road my poor soul has been consolidated
With all this bullshit that I done tolerated
How I made it can easily stated
It's like my heart be gripped with the Passion
To be the fucking greatest
Load up and take shit

Make it to some high dollar gangsta shit
Jack a stack 'til we got enough bank to split

Creep with me
Through that immortal flow
Thug Passion got you trembling, like Death on the Row
Make your move
So I can throw your mind a curve
While I'll be blowing up the scene
Like my nigga Mr. Herb
Take a toke as your heart goes full arrest
I got the bomb, so nigga, fuck the rest
You need a dub to get you flowing
And let that loc see smoke
Feeling the strokes of the 9 squeeze tight and slow

I heard it's the bomb
And you got it going on
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby
You got me dripping wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby
Oh whoa

They say money don't make the man
But damn, I'm making money
Observing you motherfuckers
'Cause some of you bitches funny
Say you want it but you bullshitting
Licking them lips, you got me about to act a fool quick
Sipping on some Alizé and Cristal
Meanwhile, buy me a drink and get to winking at me
She smiles, a niggas full of passion
Satisfaction is everlasting
""How does it feel?"" what I'm asking
While I'm rubbing on that ass
""Why you laughing?""
See, I'm digging as if I'm curious
Full blown and furious
Baby, get a grip
When I be doing this
It's so physical
My attraction driven by alcohol
Beware of my reaction
Baby I'm born to ball
Thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize and picture what I said, so
Now you can feel it, it's a portion for my niggas in motion
Forever blasting, bitches ain't ready for this Thug Passion

I heard it's the bomb
And you got it going on
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby
You got me dripping wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby
Oh whoah

Tryin' to do the same he seen on the screen
Got his big guns, Timbs, hoody and his jeans
Talk the fast talk but there's a pause in this walk
Rock his jewels, truck and he still eat pork
He get his little hustle on, he run with his major team
Crazy ass dread from Jamaica, Queens
Ain't never seen war up in his face before
Get his news from the barber shop beeper store
But if you let him tell it, he's the last man standing
talkin' bout son, I held it down with the cannon
Should of seen the way that I was blazin' at the cats
Twist of the wrist, while I was pattin' one back
Like that kid did to Menace, when he had the four pound
You know it's only right, I had to hold the fort down

Blazin' with' ya friends, when we ridin'

takin' chances, in the cut every day
Tryin' to big up, tryin' to big up with my master plan

[Chorus: x2]

As a youth I would sit up in my room and dream
One day I became with a ruthless teen
Little did I know that every step I took
Had already been signed and sealed in some books
So I took a look at what I got to work with of course
And if granted by the source move on with full force
What choice to choose, if I sin will I use
Sittin' with' the reverend in my county blues

To which ever form you base your religion on
Live by the scriptures of the Bible or Karan
Don't burn bridges if you plan to make riches
The ones that you least expect to be the worst snitches

I can feel the heat coming up from my skin
Turn up the lights, I can't believe my eyes
I think I know what she might want to do tonight
Fill me up, I just can't get enough, till I get it right, you got that right

Start me up, and don't you let it up 'til we get it right, whoa that's right

A woman walking down Main street, 
Clad only in cowboy boots and a big smile.
The arresting young lady was apprehended by police officers who said
She did not resist. 
Some of the lawmen on the scene were so shaken,
They insisted on riding with her in the backseat of the squad-car.
Now here outfit is accessorized by a lovely set of cuffs.

The Story,"I’d settle for less but I’d hold you accountable
Knock on your door but I wouldn’t take no for a ride
A month in the country, a day by your side
Two years in the forest, I can’t see the trees if you hide

And if you forgot, could I make you remember
The piece of yourself that you gave long ago?
It’s on the top current of love’s final breeze
There at the still point, that’s where I’ll be

We would find hindsight at the edge of the world
Love at the end of indifference
We’d be the lovers that time could forget
Distance would forge us, make us stronger in the end

And if I forgot, could you make me remember
The piece of myself that I left winding by?
It’s on the top current of love’s final breeze
There at the still point, that’s where I’ll be

At the still point, at the still point, at the still point of desire
At the still point, the still point, at the still point of desire
At the still point, at the still point, at the still point of desire

We’d be forever, a month in the country
A day by your side, two years in the forest
A decade of hopeful, a terrible leap
When it all comes out in the wash
I will love you, I will love you

At the still point, at the still point, at the still point of desire
At the still point, the still point, at the still point of desire
At the still point, at the still point, at the still point of desire

It took a long time to gain this weight,
It will take a long time to lose it again
I will have only water for a week, then maybe carrots,
and celery, and if I lose then Sunday I'll have brown rice
Because someone will adore me when my ribs show clearly
and I'm thin even when I sit down
Someone will admire my gorgeous arms and legs
when I'm only one hundred pounds
I bought a doctor's scale on sale today
It takes up half the bathroom, and it's really ugly,
but I know it's going to help me reach my goal
I get so dizzy when I stand up fast, and I don't feel like
dancing but I know I'm gonna do it this time, for sure
Now I walk past the fatsos eating doughnuts,
with cream filling, icing, jimmies, and I am so glad I am not
like them

and I'm thin even when I sit down
Someone will admire my gorgeous arms and legs

The Stowaways,"I get high when I see you go by, (my oh my)
When you sigh my inside just flies, (butterflies). 
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you.

It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do.
It's only love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight, (every night)
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright, (very bright)
Haven't I the right to make it up girl.

It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do.
It's only love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you.
Yes it's so hard loving you.
Loving you.",It's Only Love,1995
The Straitjackets,"Well I'm going out west where I belong
Where the days are short and the nights are long

Where I'll walk
And they walk
I'll twist
And they twist
And I'll shimmy
And they shimmy
And I'll fly
And they fly
Where they're out there having fun
In the warm California sun

Well, I'm going out west
Out on the coast
Where the California girls
Are really the most

And I'll walk
And they walk
I'll twist
And they twist
And I'll shimmy
And they shimmy
And I'll fly
And they fly
Where they're out there having fun
In the warm California sun

Well, the girls are frisky
In old 'Frisco
A pretty little chick
Wherever you go

And I'll walk
And they walk
I'll twist
And they twist
And I'll shimmy
And they shimmy
And I'll fly
And they fly
Where they're out there having fun
In the warm California sun
Where they're out there having fun
In the warm California sun",California Sun,2005
