Lenny Henry,"Get 'em laughing - keep 'em there,
You hold your own and they'll hold their's,
Hold their glasses - can't hold their beer
Tell 'em the one about the fucking queer.
Do the one that always works,
'Bout the lazy blacks that don't like work,
And once you got 'em, keep 'em there
Raise their spirits! Raise their cheer!

Do that one that never fails,
'Bout the gang of white thugs and the Asian male,
And once you got 'em, they'll be with you!
See this lot's loyal, through and through.

Tell Irish jokes and you can't miss,
Do the building site one and how they're all thick.
Keep 'em laughing - you'll have it made,
We're a friendly lot and you'll be well paid. 

But keep 'em laughing don't let it stop
Or the truth might catch up and spoil the plot.

Lenny Herman,"I'm always chasing rainbows
Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky
Some fellows look and find the sunshine
I always look and find the rain
Some fellows make a winning sometimes
I never even make a gain
Believe me, I'm always chasing rainbows
Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain
 
I'm always chasing rainbows
Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky
Some fellows look and find the sunshine
I always look and find the rain
Some fellows make a winning sometimes
I never even make a gain
Believe me, I'm always chasing rainbows

Damn girl, you got a tattoo right there
I like that, ooh shit, sexy than a motherfucker
Can I kiss that

(Chorus - 2x)
Is it on your chest (uh huh)
Is it on your back (uh huh)
Is it on your leg (uh huh)
Is it buy your cat (uh huh)
Where your tat, tat, tatty
Let me see your tattoo girl
Where your tat, tat, tatty
Let me see your tattoo girl

[Liffy Stokes]
Hey there shorty, what you working with
Let me see you pop that shit for daddy
That's shining blowing big pound out a pro caddy pick up
Diamonds flick up protect your tip tattoo bezel that lift up
Blinding them ?booshy? hoes
I bends through the Gucci store
Grinning, Sprewells spinning, but I'm standing still
Man trying to call up this zig-zotic hot mama out by the Ville then
I'm talking top flight, high priced brown sugar
With the curly butter, thick hips and all 
With the easy-e kitty cat paws, tatted above her bra
When the Twist sat down by her draws
But I guess that leaves dust and all
Cause a man keeps on running off
Just dropping her cheese, but shorty got me's
Taking trips to the tat shop, come on the black top
Let her feel Anita while we sold be	's
Cause you really gotta get greedy
Fish that pearl, and then show it off to the world
Thickness shorty got niggas out here screaming
Let me see your tattoo girl

(Chorus)

[Bennie Franks]
It's Mr. Fat, freaky, black, nasty and here for money grams
It's something bout a red bone tattoo, god damn
You need a cover up, X out your baby daddy name
Girl I know you love to fuck, just the way you took the pain
Check my name and Eddy came, oops I don't mean to be rude
I got a fetish for oops I mean I love some tattoos
Let's get up on a room, everything is on me
Ain't got an A and the ointment but I got some Vaseline
The Brandi, I can't stand it the way my mess 
And let's get stranded, I kizzel my nizzel fa shizzel 
My cameras handy, bumping to this shit type to break the walls down
In Miami, top notch swallow and keep the ostrich and get up

(Chorus - 2x)

[High Beam]
I guess you with me like a reeeeal
And then she suck me like a neckbone
I've been gone slap then I took the Milly that home
Since nobody needed to drive I'ma be the one they gone put it on
(did you know me daddy) Man I ain't even have to ask shorty
It was right before my eyes, tattoos on her chest
Snake wrapped around her legs all the way up to her thighs
Her size, scrumptious fulfilling the fantasy of me and my guys
When she pulled her pants down 
Made me want to buck she oh my, what a surprise
Man I'm hoping, she'll let a nigga get it wet I gets wild and open
Way too provoking, on the beach rubbing her body down with suntan lotion
What's that, another tat with the Playboy bunny by her cootie cat
Got one going in the crack of her ass 
But she can't really see cause her booty fat
Girl you don't know what I'd do to that
got limo scrapes ride the butter crack
Put Legit Ballin all across your back, take that off and let me see that

(Chorus)

[Lenny Hooks]
Sip the cris and light the hydro
Spider chick across the dance flo'
Pimps like them tilt the kango
At the club she shotguns 6-0-0
Straight to the Mo' she came out, her clothes
Tattooed up like her nails ain't gold
I'm searching around like I'm 5-0
I'm bout to put something on it this ain't no tattoo hoe",Tattoo,2002
Lenny Ibizarre,"Across the common
Leaves sway
I walk across the common
Children play
An ordinary day

I feel the ground beneath my feet solid
I feel the air circulate around me
Across the common children play

She's got suntan lotion
Feels no pain

Hasn't got the sweet he wanted

Lenny Kaye,"I was dreaming in my dreaming 
Of an aspect bright and fair 
And my sleeping it was broken 
But my dream it lingered near 
In the form of shining valleys 
Where the pure air recognized 
And my senses newly opened 
I awakened to the cry 
That the people have the power 
To redeem the work of fools 
Upon the meek the graces shower 
It' s decreed the people rule 

The people have the power 
The people have the power 
The people have the power 
The people have the power 

Vengeful aspects became suspect 
And bending low as if to hear 
And the armies ceased advancing 
Because the people had their ear 
And the shepherds and the soldiers 
Lay beneath the stars 
Exchanging visions 
And laying arms 
To waste in the dust 
In the form of shining valleys 
Where the pure air recognized 
And my senses newly opened 
I awakened to the cry 

Where there were deserts 
I saw fountains 
Like cream the waters rise 
And we strolled there together 
With none to laugh or criticize 
And the leopard 
And the lamb 
Lay together truly bound 
I was hoping in my hoping 
To recall what I had found 
I was dreaming in my dreaming 
God knows a purer view 
As I surrender to my sleeping 
I commit my dream to you 

Where there were deserts 
I saw fountains 
Like cream the waters rise 
And we strolled there together 
With none to laugh or criticize 
And the leopard 
And the lamb 
Lay together truly bound 
I was hoping in my hoping 
To recall what I had found 
I was dreaming in my dreaming 
God knows a purer view 
As I surrender to my sleeping 
I commit my dream to you 

The power to dream to rule 
To wrestle the world from fools 
It' s decreed the people rule 
It' s decreed the people rule 
 
I believe everything we dream 
Can come to pass through our union 
We can turn the world around 
We can turn the earth' s revolution 
We have the power 
People have the power",People Have the Power,2006
Lenny Kaye,"I feel like an alligator
Climbing up the escalator
Climbing up the escalator

Bet you wouldn't buy it
I'm feeling violent
Bet your bleeding eye in, turn up and fly it

If I didn't like the way you stared at me

I could show you found to the lost and find

Were so whole and pure

Mean nothing to me anymore

Too many District Attorneys concerned with the actions
Of one individual he's criminally attached
I turned in all my rap chips I'm earning my bachelors
While dating all the models and actresses
I'm learning all the potholes in every single barrio
Trying not to mess up my axis kid
On the road to the riches through trafficking
Through rappining and whatever's happening
Roc-a-wear I'm the young black Ralph Lauren
Every time I get out they put me right back in
The Michael Corleone of the microphone
The Michelangelo of flow I paint pictures with poems
I gather no moss like a rolling stone
Case the Grim Reaper visits my home, nigga I'm gone c'mon
 
(C'mon) It's the Roc 
(C'mon) That's right (C'mon)

Tote more Guns then Roses, foes is, 
Visibly shook of the invisible bully, let's go
Flowers need water to grow, it gotta rain
And in order to experience joy you need pain
Every time a baby is born, somebody's slain
You know the saying, somebody's lose is another's gain
The sun comes out when the water goes down the drain
A rainbow then the clouds come out we do it again
Everything evens up, you just wait
Even a garbage can gets a steak
You ain't even a garbage can you have faith
But when it turns your way before it turns away
Gotta turn that into something you gotta learn from Jay
You will get return in your investment if attention you pay let's go

I heard a cry within my soul

And if that day comes

Niggaz want the crown but can't handle it
This rap game's getting scandalous
I done lost my best friend in Los Angeles

My other nigga turned Evangelist
But I can't quit cause I'm on some Evander shit
Fuck the money and the white sand and shit
When it's said and done you gunna understand this shit

Your man talking about Hummers and little cars
That only fit in his little house little garage
His lifestyle is just a little mirage
He the type of cat that never had a menage

Backrub, you know a little massage
Tight shit you get when you Head Nigga in charge
I'm in the Rolls listening to the bars
Leaned back wit a chick smoking on cigars

From Bogota, Colombia, chicks from Panama
The diamond fellow, mami hello
Pull up in the drop my Ferrari yellow
Pull off your top make it shake like Jello

Drop everything! When you walk in the door
Free your self 'fore get ya ass on the floor!

That Rolls Royce Phantom, it ain't no joke ma
Weed brownie at 2, but I will not smoke ma
Don't talk about licking if it ain't deepthroat ma

I give you great dick, I make your face flip
Then take ya aboard a nigga Spaceship
Star Trak, my fault I mean Mother Ship
Put on the cameras, try it you'll be loving it

And you can bring your girl and we can get on another tit
Me? I'm a Mount Airy fellow
Or down in Florida wit the Maranello
Driving slow watch the mami mouthing ""hello""

Get wit ya man if you want love you better
Trying to get +Dirty+ like +Aguilera+
Yep, he's a skater the kids that's rhyming
But I'm also young and rich wit a big ass diamond

Rocks the same colors as daisy's
Why'all niggaz is lazy, I'm on my j-o-be	
And that's why ya hate on me

And power from here to upstate
Why'all sweet as cupcakes
So why niggaz stay wit tough faces?
I stay trying to figure what Loon and Puff make

Flying 'round Jesus statue wit a mountain in Brazil
Bitch please! you ain't never been to Guatemala
Eating shrimp by the dollar taking flights to Negril

Me and Loon in the hills giving mami's the chills

How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Throw my heart away each spring
Now a spring romance
Hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to winter
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling

Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park
Just to kill those lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most

All afternoon
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune
This is love this is it
Heard it before
And I know the score
And I decide that love is a bore
Love seem sure around the new year
Now it's April

Love is just a ghost
Spring arrived on time
But what became of you, dear
Spring can really hang you up the most
Spring can really hang you up the most

Spring is here
There's no mistaken
Robins build their nest from coast to coast
My heart tries the same
So they won't hear it breaking
Spring can really hang you up the most

College boys are riding somewhere
Tender passion there it grows
But I'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnet
Spring can really hang you up the most

Love came my way
I'm holding the last
We had our day
Now that's all in the past
Spring came along
A season of song
For love's sweet promise
But something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit
My condition must be chronic

Winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying
For snow to hide the clover

Why don't you get away? Get away
Lay awake at night till the sun comes up in the morning
Never excited; it all seems boring
Make up your mind which way to go about it
Choose your road, just don't doubt it
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
I know we can. I know we can, I know we can, I know we can
Ah. Get away, let's leave today, let's get away!

Lenny White,"There are some folks I used to know
Who used to smile and say hello
And spin the world and turn the page

Entertaining from the stage
But father time forever true
Loves its own and me and you
And disappear just like the sun
When the day is done

The world is falling down, hold my hand
It's a lonely sound, hold my hand
We'll follow the breeze and go like the wind
And look for a place where the willows bend
Oh, the world is falling down, hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my hand

Summer's gone and winter's here
We had a lot of rain this year
The news is really very sad
The time is late, the fruit is bad
The morning's come and roosters crow
But people have nowhere to go
And disappear just like the sun
When the day is done

The world is falling down, hold my hand
It's a lonely sound, hold my hand
We'll follow the sun and live for the day
And look for a place where the children play

When I try to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel

He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
Or pick it up after he throws it

Babe, please crawl out your window
Use your hands and your legs, it won't ruin you
Now how you gonna say that he will haunt you?
When you could go back to him anytime you want to

He look so righteous while your face is so changed
As you sit on the box that you keep him on
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Religion of the little ten women
That backs up their views and their face is so bruised
Come on out, the dark is just beginning

Babe, please come out your window
Use your hands and your legs, it won't ruin you
How can you say that he will haunt you?
When you can go back to him anytime you want to

You got a lot of nerve to say you are my friend
If you won't come out your window

You got a lot of nerve to say you are my friend

We held each other tenderly
And just before you spoke your name
The clock struck twelve and you ran away

Kissing and holding you next to me
Midnight girl, the story just can't end

A broken heart and shattered plans

I knocked on the door, but still my knocks went unanswered
And then I went home and I-I watched television until television went off
And then I played my records until I just didn?t want to hear them anymore
And finally I went to bed, but I found myself waking up a few hours later

We were always hand in hand
I was hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails

You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her""

Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years

My life grew sweeter through the years

If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there

Lenora Zenzalai Helm,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2003
Lenore Raphael,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,
Lenore Raphael,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,
Lenore Raphael,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

When if ever, will my lips know

Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1991
Lenore Raphael,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

Lenore Raphael,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2002
Lenore Raphael,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,2004
Lenore Troia,"They can come take it all away

The rocks that saves me 
It saves me

On the night wind that takes me 
Just where I want

And I live when a new surprise surrenders

I play with feeling

Lenore VonStein,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody

E o sol
Beija o barco e luz

Volta do mar, desmaia o sol
E o barquinho a deslizar
E a vontade de cantar

E o barquinho, coração

Tudo isso traz

E então
O barquinho vai
E a tardinha cai

Leo Addeo & His Orchestra,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner and I'm around you.",Love Is Just Around the Corner,1995
Leo Addeo & His Orchestra,"'Tention folks, speak of jokes
This is one on me
Took my gal to a dance 
At the armory
Music played, dancers swayed
Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""
 
Young and small short and tall
Folks most everywhere
Take a chance do this dance
They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave 
Just to do this step
Off they go, nice and slow
When the band starts playing
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep

I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Leo Burmester,"My band of soaks, my den of dissolute's
My dirty jokes, my always pissed as newts
My sons of whores spend their lives in my inn
Homing pigeons homing in
They fly through my doors,
And they crawl out on all fours

Welcome, Monsieur, sit yourself down
And meet the best innkeeper in town
As for the rest, all of 'em crooks
Rooking their guests and crooking the books
Seldom do you see
Honest men like me
A gent of good intent
Who's content to be

Master of the house, doling out the charm
Ready with a handshake and an open palm
Tells a saucy tale, makes a little stir
Customers appreciate a bon-viveur
Glad to do a friend a favor
Doesn't cost me to be nice
But nothing gets you nothing
Everything has got a little price

Master of the house, keeper of the zoo
Ready to relieve 'em of a sou or two
Watering the wine, making up the weight
Pickin' up their knick-knacks when they can't see straight
Everybody loves a landlord
Everybody's bosom friend
I do whatever pleases
Jesus! Won't I bleed 'em in the end!

Master of the house, quick to catch yer eye
Never wants a passerby to pass him by
Servant to the poor, butler to the great
Comforter, philosopher, and lifelong mate!
Everybody's boon companion
Everybody's chaperone
But lock up your valises
Jesus! Won't I skin you to the bone!

Food beyond compare. Food beyond belief
Mix it in a mincer and pretend it's beef
Kidney of a horse, liver of a cat
Filling up the sausages with this and that
Residents are more than welcome
Bridal suite is occupied
Reasonable charges
Plus some little extras on the side!
(Oh Santa!)

Charge 'em for the lice, extra for the mice
Two percent for looking in the mirror twice
Here a little slice, there a little cut
Three percent for sleeping with the window shut
When it comes to fixing prices
There are a lot of tricks I knows
How it all increases, all them bits and pieces
Jesus! It's amazing how it grows!

(Oh, sorry love
Let's get something done about that)
I used to dream that I would meet a prince
But God Almighty, have you seen what's happened since?

Master of the house? Isn't worth my spit!
Comforter, philosopher' and lifelong shit!
Cunning little brain, regular Voltaire
Thinks he's quite a lover but there's not much there
What a cruel trick of nature landed me with such a louse
God knows how I've lasted living with this bastard in the house!

Master of the house!
Master and a half!
Comforter, philosopher
Don't make me laugh!
Servant to the poor, butler to the great
Hypocrite and toady and inebriate!

Everybody bless the landlord!
Everybody bless his spouse!

Raise it up the master's arse
Everybody raise a glass to the Master of the House!",Master Of The House,2003

De las noches sin luna y los días sin sol
Con los brazos cruzados se me fue la fortuna
Y la inmensa aventura de mi último

Entre cuatro paredes que me ocultan del sol
Con los brazos cruzados soy igual que esa ola
En espuma se rompe contra el duro espiral

Que a mi alma daría la ansiada libertad
Con los brazos cruzados ya a mi lado no hay nadie
Que me indique el camino con amor de verdad

Can't you get into the swing of it, lady, when do we start?

When the lady is kissable and the evening is cool,
Any dream is permissible in the heart of a fool.

When will I see your face
Why do you just elude me
And leave me this lonely space

Léo Ferré,"Mon frère était un assassin
Qui travaillait avec la lame
Et chaque soir après l' turbin
Il faisait travailler sa femme
Ma soeur écrivait de beaux vers
Dans un journal hebdomadaire
Et si son verbe était amer
C'est qu'on avait tué l' libraire

C'est c' qu'on appelle en vérité
Une famille respectable
Et l'assassin fut invité
A mettre les pieds sous la table

Mon père avait un bar-tabac
Que fréquentaient de drôl's de têtes
Ils vivaient tous dans l'aléa
Et papa plaçait leur galette
Ma soeur accordait au comptoir
D'incommensurables chopines
Bossant du matin jusqu'au soir
Cherchant une rime à rapine

C'est c' qu'on appelle en vérité
Une famille infatigable
Le travail c'est la liberté
C'est une chose formidable

Ma mère alors avait un tic
C'était le complexe d'Oedipe
Ce n'est peut-être pas très chic
Mais j'avais déjà des principes
Ma belle soeur je vous l'ai dit
Avait un métier unanime
Elle aimait beaucoup son mari
Trouvant cela plus légitime

C'est c' qu'on appell' en vérité
Une famille véritable
Où l'instinct de propriété
Se révelait inéluctable

Tonton tata soudain fauchés
Fatigués de l'Europe flasque
Devinrent tous deux attachés
A une ambassade fantasque
On chuchote sous le manteau
Que tous les soirs à Buenos Aires
Tonton tata dans leur huit-clos
Font dire maints et maints rosaires

C'est c' qu'on appell' en vérité
Une famille présentable
Et si tonton fut arrêté
Ça parait à peine croyable

D'autres frangins d'autres frangines
Y'en avait qui faisaient partout
Faut avouer que pour la ligne
Ma mère en avait pris un coup
Et malgré l'odeur d'ammoniac
Le père aimait à se repaître
Pour qu'on lui fout' le prix cognac
Y'avait plus tell'ment de kilomètres

C'est c' qu'on appell' en vérité
Une famille ou une fable
Écrite sans moralité
Il me manque une rime en "" able ""

Et si vous saviez combien cela est préférable...",L' Esprit de Famille,1958
Léo Ferré,"L'île Saint-Louis en ayant marre
D'être à côté de la Cité
Un jour a rompu ses amarres
Elle avait soif de liberté
Avec ses joies avec ses peines
Qui s'en allaient au fil de l'eau
On la vit descendre la Seine
Ell' se prenait pour un bateau
Quand on est une île
On reste tranquille
Au coeur de la ville
C'est ce que l'on dit
Mais un jour arrive
On quitte la rive
En douce on s'esquive
Pour voir du pays

De la mer Noire à la Mer Rouge
Des îles blanches aux îles d'or
Vers l'horizon où rien ne bouge
Point n'a trouvé l'île au trésor
Mais tout au bout de son voyage
Dans un endroit peu fréquenté
On lui raconta le naufrage
L'île au trésor s'était noyée
Quand on est une île
On vogue tranquille
Trop loin de la ville
Malgré ce qu'on dit
Mais un jour arrive
Où l'âme en dérive
On songe à la rive
Du bon vieux Paris

L'île Saint-Louis a de la peine
Du pôle Sud au pôle Nord
L'océan ne vaut pas la Seine
Le large ne vaut pas le port
Si l'on a trop de vague à l'âme

Quand l'orgue ne jouera 
Que par analogie 

Au temps des roses rouges 
Sur mon ami Pleyel 
Je mettrai au pluriel 
La complainte du crime 
Au temps des roses rouges

Notés sur mon lebel 

Mourra bien qui mourra 
D'une vraie maladie 
Car la roue finira

Que nous mangerions l'amour à genoux

De celles qu'on voit mais qui ne sont plus
J'y regarderais derrière la toile
De ce grand tableau de bleu suspendu

Si tes cheveux fous étaient la misaine
Et que de ton coeur je fisse un bateau
Tout en remontant le cours de la Seine
Tu serais Paris et moi matelot

Si ton astre noir où je m'illumine
Était le calice et si j'étais Dieu
J'y boirais la Mort jusqu'à la racine
Et puis m'en irais refaire les cieux

Si les soleils morts des plaines célestes
Descendaient un jour dans ton corps éteint

Vous qui êtes en croix sur la rose des vents
Vous qui tendez les bras au larron du printemps
Vous dont les fauves gris font patte de velours
Vous qui faites la pluie comme on ferait l'amour
Comme un oiseau dans l'infortune
S'en va boire un verre de lune
Le vent qui n'a plus rien à lui
S'en va boire un verre de pluie
Comme un oiseau dans l'infortune
S'en va boire un verre de lune

Des divans profonds comme des tombeaux,
Et d'étranges fleurs sur des étagères,
Ecloses pour nous sous des ciels plus beaux.

Usant à l'envie leurs chaleurs dernières,
Nos deux coeurs seront deux vastes flambeaux,
Qui réfléchiront leurs doubles lumières
Dans nos deux esprits, ces miroirs jumeaux
Un soir fait de rose et de bleu mystique,
Nous échangerons un éclair unique,
Comme un long sanglot, tout chargé d'adieux 
Et plus tard un Ange, entr' ouvrant les portes
Viendra ranimer, fidèle et joyeux,
Les miroirs ternis et les flammes mortes.",La Mort des Amants,1984

Couvrant des fauteuils de promesses

Vous aviez vos portraits sur les murs de nos villes
Noirs de barbe et de nuits hirsutes menaçants

Parce qu'à prononcer vos noms sont difficiles
Y cherchait un effet de peur sur les passants

Nul ne semblait vous voir français de préférence

Mais à l'heure du couvre-feu des doigts errants
Avaient écrit sous vos photos MORTS POUR LA FRANCE
Et les mornes matins en étaient différents

Tout avait la couleur uniforme du givre
A la fin février pour vos derniers moments
Et c'est alors que l'un de vous dit calmement
Bonheur à tous bonheur à ceux qui vont survivre
Je meurs sans haine en moi pour le peuple allemand

Adieu la peine et le plaisir adieu les roses
Adieu la vie adieu la lumière et le vent

Où, poussant le soleil oblique,
Les ténèbres s'établiront.

Tendront complaisamment leur perche aux chats nichés

Derrière ses vitrines

Quand je pense pourtant aux perceurs de plafond
Dont la vie est si dure
Au cinéma j'ai vu comment ces gens-là font
Et Dieu sait si ça dure
A ceux qui pour avoir le respect du milieu
Et de belles bottines
Livrent leur soeur cadette à de vilains messieurs
Pour des prix de famine

Je me dis caressant mes descentes de lit
Mes manchons mes écharpes
Qu'il ne faut pas cédér à la mélancolie
Et se joindre aux escarpes
Qu'un magasin vaut mieux que de faire en prison
Des chaussons de lisière
Et mieux cent fois brosser les manteaux de vison
Que butter les rentières

Mieux lustrer le renard que d'aller proposer
L'héroïne à tant l'once
Mieux chez soi demeure où sont entreposés
Le castor et le skunks
Et puis qu'on ait ou non vendu son chinchilla
Son hermine ou son phoque
Il vous reste du moins cet amer plaisir-là
Vitupérer l'époque

Léo Ferré,"Je chante pour passer le temps
Petit qu'il me reste de vivre
Comme on dessine sur le givre
Comme on se fait le coeur content
A lancer cailloux sur l'étang
Je chante pour passer le temps

J'ai vécu le jour des merveilles
Vous et moi souvenez-vous-en
Et j'ai franchi le mur des ans
Des miracles plein les oreilles
Notre univers n'est plus pareil
J'ai vécu le jour des merveilles

Allons que ces doigts se dénouent
Comme le front d'avec la gloire
Nos yeux furent premiers à voir
Les nuages plus bas que nous
Et l'alouette à nos genoux
Allons que ces doigts se dénouent

Nous avons fait des clairs de lune
Pour nos palais et nos statues
Qu'importe à présent qu'on nous tue
Les nuits tomberont une à une
La Chine s'est mise en Commune
Nous avons fait des clairs de lune

Et j'en dirais et j'en dirais
Tant fut cette vie aventure
Où l'homme a pris grandeur nature
Sa voix par-dessus les forêts
Les monts les mers et les secrets
Et j'en dirais et j'en dirais

Oui pour passer le temps je chante
Au violon s'use l'archet
La pierre au jet des ricochets
Et que mon amour est touchante
Près de moi dans l'ombre penchante
Oui pour passer le temps je chante

Je chante pour passer le temps
Oui pour passer le temps je chante",Je Chante Pour Passer le Temps,1989
Léo Ferré,"Mon sombre amour d'orange amère
Ma chanson d'écluse et de vent
Mon quartier d'ombre où vient rêvant
Mourir la mer

Mon beau mois d'août dont le ciel pleut
Des étoiles sur les monts calmes
Ma songerie aux murs de palmes
Où l'air est bleu

Mes bras d'ormes faibles merveilles
Renaissent ma soif et ma faim
Collier collier des soirs sans fin
Où le coeur veille

Est-ce qu'on sait ce qui se passe
C'est peut-être bien ce tantôt
Que l'on jettera le manteau
Dessus ma face

Coupez ma gorge et les pivoines
Vite apportez mon vin mon sang
Pour lui plaire comme en passant
Font les avoines

Il me reste si peu de temps
Pour aller au bout de moi-même
Et pour crier Dieu que je t'aime
Je t'aime tant, je t'aime tant",Je T'Aime Tant,1989
Léo Ferré,"Refrain :
Il n'aurait fallu
Qu'on moment de plus
Pour que la mort vienne
Mais une main nue
Alors est venue
Qui a pris la mienne

Qui donc a rendu
Leurs couleurs perdues
Aux jours aux semaines
Sa réalité
A l'immense été
Des choses humaines

Moi qui frémissais
Toujours je ne sais
De quelle colère
Deux bras ont suffi
Pour faire à ma vie
Un grand collier d'air

Rien qu'un mouvement
Ce geste en dormant
Léger qui me frôle
Un souffle posé
Moins ... une rosée
Contre mon épaule

Un front qui s'appuie
A moi dans la nuit
Deux grands yeux ouverts
Et tout m'a semblé
Comme un champ de blé
Dans cet univers

Un tendre jardin
Dans l'herbe où soudain
La verveine pousse
Et mon coeur défunt
Renaît au parfum
Qui fait l'ombre douce

Refrain",Il N'Aurait Fallu,1989
Léo Ferré,"Tu n'en reviendras pas toi qui courais les filles
Jeune homme dont j'ai vu battre le coeur à nu
Quand j'ai déchiré ta chemise et toi non plus
Tu n'en reviendras pas vieux joueur de manille

Qu'un obus a coupé par le travers en deux
Pour une fois qu'il avait un jeu du tonnerre
Et toi le tatoué l'ancien légionnaire
Tu survivras longtemps sans visage sans yeux

On part Dieu sait pour où ça tient du mauvais rêve
On glissera le long de la ligne de feu
Quelque part ça commence à n'être plus du jeu
Les bonshommes là-bas attendent la relève

Roule au loin roule train des dernières lueurs
Les soldats assoupis que ta danse secoue
Laissent pencher leur front et fléchissent le cou
Cela sent le tabac la laine et la sueur

Comment vous regarder sans voir vos destinées
Fiancés de la terre et promis des douleurs
La veilleuse vous fait de la couleur des pleurs
Vous bougez vaguement vos jambes condamnées

Déjà la pierre pense où votre nom s'inscrit
Déjà vous n'êtes plus qu'un mot d'or sur nos places
Déjà le souvenir de vos amours s'efface
Déjà vous n'êtes plus que pour avoir péri",Tu N'En Reviendras Pas,1989

Pour les mini tarifs

Tout sauf de l'eau bénite 
Et mêle à ses hoquets 
L'parfum du beaujolais

Et pour cela, préfère l'Impair
Plus vagu' et plus soluble dans l'air
Sans rien en lui pèse ou qui pose,

Il faut aussi que tu n'ailles point
Choisir tes mots sans quelque méprise,
Rien de plus cher que la chanson grise
Où l'Indécis au Précis se joint.

C'est des beaux yeux derrière des voiles,
C'est le grand jour tremblant de midi,
C'est par un ciel d'automn' attiédi,
Le bleu fouillis des claires étoiles,

Car nous voulons la Nuanc' encor,
Pas la Couleur, rien que la nuance !
Oh ! la nuance seule fiance
Le rêv' au rêve et la flût' au cor !

Fuis du plus loin la Pointe assassine,

Tu feras bien en train d'énergie,
De rendre un peu la Rime assagie.
Si l'on n'y veille, elle ira jusqu'où ?

Ô qui dira les torts de la Rime ?
Quel enfant sourd ou quel nègre fou
Nous a forgé ce bijou d'un sou
Qui sonne creux et faux sous la lime ?

De la musique encore et toujours !
Que ton vers soit la chose envolée
Qu'on sent qui fuit d'une âme en allée
Vers d'autres cieux à d'autres amours.

Et tout le reste est littérature.",Art Poetique,1990

Ils disent la bonne aventure
Pour des piments et du vin doux

On passe la nuit claire à boire
On danse en frappant dans ses mains
On n'a pas le temps de le croire
Il fait grand jour et c'est demain
On revient d'une seule traite
Gais sans un sou vaguement gris
Avec des fleurs plein les charrettes
Son destin dans la paume écrit

J'ai pris la main d'une éphémère
Qui m'a suivi dans ma maison
Elle avait les yeux d'outre-mer
Elle en montrait la déraison
Elle avait la marche légère
Et de longues jambes de faon
J'aimais déjà les étrangères
Quand j'étais un petit enfant

Celle-ci par-là vite vite
De l'odeur des magnolias
Sa robe tomba tout de suite
Quand ma hâte la délia
En ces temps-là j'étais crédule
Un mot m'était promission
Et je prenais les campanules
Pour les fleurs de la passion

A chaque fois tout recommence
Toute musique me séduit

Pour toi, j'ai fait, pour toi, cette chanson
Cruelle et câline.

Je chanterai tes yeux d'or et d'onyx
Purs de toutes ombres,
Puis le Léthé de ton sein, puis le Styx
De tes cheveux sombres.

Comme la voix d'un mort qui chanterait
Du fond de sa fosse,
Maîtresse, entends monter vers ton retrait

Puis je louerai beaucoup, comme il convient,
Cette chair bénie
Dont le parfum opulent me revient
Les nuits d'insomnie.

Et pour finir, je dirai le baiser
De ta lèvre rouge,
Et ta douceur à me martyriser,
Mon ange ! ma Gouge !

Ouvre ton âme et ton oreille au son

Armstrong est r'çu chez l' Président
Il y'est allé sans sa trompette
Depuis deux jours qu'ils sont là d'dans
C'est plus du blues c'est la tempéte

Dieu est nègre

Il a de p'tits cheveux d'argent
Qui font au ciel comm' des nuages
Et dans sa gorge y'a du plain-chant
Comm' dans les bars au moyen âge

Dieu est nègre

Et dans la gorge à mon Jimmy
Y'a tant d' soleil à trois cents balles
Du blues du rêve et du whisky

Léo Ferré,"J'ai pris à Mackie son costume
Mais sa complainte sans appel
Qu'il se la chante à White Chapel
Je suis allergique à la brume,
J'ai acheté avec les rentes
Que me rapportent mes chansons
A un taulier de Barbizon
Une guinguette pas marrante
Même au plus beau de la saison.
C'est pour mes bell's indifférentes
Que je voulais mettre en prison...

Ces filles-là sont toutes celles
Qui, jadis, quand j'avais du coeur
M'assassinaient d'un air moqueur
Ou bien se prétendaient pucelles...
Leurs prénoms c'est monnaie courante
L'important c'est qu'elles soient là
En frêles robes de gala
Et qu'elles soient restées charmantes
Mes Virginies de cinéma
Elles ne sont plus indifférentes
Elles ont maintenant peur de moi...

Ell's ne seront plus à personne
Elles garderont leur beauté
Pas plus qu'il n'y aura d'été
Pour elles ne viendra l'automne...
Dans ce jardin où se lamente
A tout jamais le vent d'hiver
Sur le pick-up c'est le même air
D'une musique sidérante
Et qui leur tape sur les nerfs.
Et mes belles indifférentes
Sont sensibles à ce truc pervers...

Il faut les voir quand je radine
Grandi par mes talons bottiers
Et que je prends un air altier
En faisant siffler ma badine...
Elles m'apportent déférentes
Mes cigarettes et mon whisky
Mais je ne dis jamais merci
Et garde une moue méprisante
A la manière de Mackie
Et mes belles indifférentes
De leurs mains glacées me supplient...

Elles supplient pendant des heures
Ce n'est pas du travail bâclé,
Et tout à coup je ferme à clé
Et je les laisse là qui pleurent...
N'écoutez pas les gens qui mentent
En disant qu'ils ont rencontré
L'une ou l'autre, ce n'est pas vrai
C'est des sosies ou des parentes
Les vraies de vrai sont enfermées
Dans ma guinguette pas marrante
D'où ell's ne sortiront jamais...
Mes vraies, mes bell's indifférentes
Que je n'ai pas cessé d'aimer.",Les Indifferentes,1996
Léo Ferré,"Le jour où j' m'en irai

A Tahiti, Tahiti
Je saluerais bientôt
Monsieur Gerbault
Sa goélette en majesté
Viendrait traîner sa traîne
Dans le ciel mouillé
Et partout il flotterait
Des signes d'amitié
Comme des regrets.

Sa route atroce à ma démence
Et qui m'a montré la contrée
Que la bonté seule ensemence

Pour chasser les mauvaises fièvres
Et j'ai flambé comme un genièvre

Dans l'Il' de Ré
Où sont ses yeux, où est sa bouche

Merde à Vauban,
C'est un p'tit corbillard tout noir
Étroit et vieux
Qui m' sortira d'ici un soir

Que je veux baiser comme il faut
Comm' sav'nt baiser les gigolos

Paname

Rang' tes pépées rang' tes ballots,
Rang' tes poulets rang' tes autos
Paname
Et viens m'aimer comme autrefois,
La nuit surtout quand toi et moi
On marchait vers on n' savait quoi

Paname
Y'a des noms d' rues que l'on oublie,
C'est dans ces rues qu'après minuit,
Tu m' faisais voir ton p'tit Paris
Paname
Quand tu chialais dans tes klaxons,
Perdue là-bas parmi les homm's
Tu v'nais vers moi comme un' vraie môme

Paname
Ce soir j'ai envie de danser,
De danser avec tes pavés
Que l' monde regarde avec ses pieds
Paname
T' es bell' tu sais sous tes lampions,
Des fois quand tu pars en saison
Dans les bras d'un accordéon.

Paname,
Quand tu t'habill's avec du bleu,
Ça fait sortir les amoureux
Qui dis'nt "" à Paris tous les deux ""
Paname,
Quand tu t'habill's avec du gris,
Les couturiers n'ont qu'un souci,
C'est d' fout' en gris tout's les souris.

Paname,
Quand tu t'ennuies tu fais les quais,
Tu fais la Seine et les noyés,
Ça fait prend' l'air et ça distrait,
Paname,
C'est fou c' que tu peux fair' causer,
Mais les gens n'sav'nt pas qui tu es,
lls viv'nt chez toi mais t' voient jamais.

Paname,
L' soleil a mis son pyjama
Toi tu t'allum's et dans tes bras
Y'a m'sieur Haussmann qui t' fait du plat,
Paname,
Monte avec moi combien veux-tu?
Y'a deux mille ans qu' t' es dans la rue,
Des fois que j' te r'fasse un' vertu.

Paname
Si tu souriais j'aurais ton charme,
Si tu pleurais j'aurais tes larmes,
Si on t' frappait j' prendrais les armes,
Paname,
Tu n'es pas pour moi qu'un frisson
Qu'une idée qu'un' fille à chansons
Et c'est pour ça que j' crie ton nom...

Léo Ferré,"Ce sont de drôl's de typ's qui vivent de leur plume
Ou qui ne vivent pas c'est selon la saison
Ce sont de drôl's de typ's qui traversent la brume
Avec des pas d'oiseaux sous l'aile des chansons

Leur âme est en carafe sous les ponts de la Seine
Leurs sous dans les bouquins qu'ils n'ont jamais vendus
Leur femm' est quelque part au bout d'une rengaine
Qui nous parle d'amour et de fruit défendu

Ils mettent des couleurs sur le gris des pavés
Quand ils marchent dessus ils se croient sur la mer
Ils mettent des rubans autour de l'alphabet
Et sortent dans la rue leurs mots pour prendre l'air

Ils ont des chiens parfois compagnons de misère
Et qui lèchent leurs mains de plume et d'amitié
Avec dans le museau la fidèle lumière
Qui les conduit vers les pays d'absurdité

Ce sont de drôl's de typ's qui regardent les fleurs
Et qui voient dans leurs plis des sourires de femme
Ce sont de drôl's de typ's qui chantent le malheur
Sur les pianos du coeur et les violons de l'âme

Leurs bras tout déplumés se souviennent des ailes
Que la littérature accrochera plus tard
A leur spectre gelé au-dessus des poubelles
Où remourront leurs vers comme un effet de l'Art

lls marchent dans l'azur la tête dans les villes
Et savent s'arrêter pour bénir les chevaux
Ils marchent dans l'horreur la tête dans des îles
Où n'abordent jamais les âmes des bourreaux

Ils ont des paradis que l'on dit d'artifice
Et l'on met en prison leurs quatrains de dix sous
Comme si l'on mettait aux fers un édifice
Sous prétexte que les bourgeois sont dans l'égout...",Les Poétes,1998

Où ma parole
On v'nait paumer
Ses bell's années

Sur le visage de la terre
Et les clients les plus malins
Venaient y lire leurs misères
De Vaugirard à Levallois
Des Lilas jusqu'au pont de Sèvres
Paris portait sa grande croix
Dorée par des millions d'orfèvres
La tour Eiffel jouait aux dés
Sa ridicule nostalgie
Les Tuileries se démodaient

Et de l'Étoile au Panthéon

Au portillon automatique.

De Saint-Germain-des-Prés pour signer vos quittances

Toutes les femmes en gésine
Les gavroches qui en sortaient
Au Sacré-Coeur sonnaient matines
Et les aveugles de Paris
Se sont pendus à ma défroque
Dans leurs yeux blancs en travestis,
Se reflétaient d'autres époques.

De ces ciels brouillés

Si mystérieux
De tes traîtres yeux
Brillant à travers leurs larmes

Là tout n'est qu'ordre et beauté 
Luxe calme et volupté. 

Des meubles luisants,
Polis par les ans,
Décoreraient notre chambre,
Les plus rares fleurs
Mêlant leurs odeurs
Aux vagues senteurs de l'ambre,
Les riches plafonds,
Les miroirs profonds,
La splendeur orientale,
Tout y parlerait
A l'âme en secret
Sa douce langue natale.
Là, tout n'est qu'ordre et beauté,
Luxe, calme et volupté.

Dans cette grande plaine où l'autan froid se joue,
Où par les longues nuits la girouette s'enroue,
Mon âme mieux qu'au temps du tiède renouveau
Ouvrira largement ses ailes de corbeau.

Rien n'est plus doux au coeur plein de choses funèbres,
Et sur qui dès longtemps descendent les frimas,
O blafardes saisons, reines de nos climats,

Tigre adoré, monstre aux airs indolents ;

Dans l'épaisseur de ta crinière lourde ;
Dans tes jupons remplis de ton parfum
Ensevelir ma tête endolorie,
Et respirer, comme une fleur flétrie,
Le doux relent de mon amour défunt.

Je veux dormir ! dormir plutôt que vivre !
Dans un sommeil douteux comme la mort,
J'étalerai mes baisers sans remords
Sur ton beau corps poli comme le cuivre.
Pour engloutir mes sanglots apaisés
Rien ne me vaut l'abîme de ta couche ;
L'oubli puissant habite sur ta bouche,
Et le Léthé coule dans tes baisers.

A mon destin, désormais mon délice,
J'obéirai comme un prédestiné ;
Martyr docile, innocent condamné,
Dont la ferveur attise le supplice,
Je sucerai, pour noyer ma rancoeur,

- "" Moi, j'ai la lèvre humide, et je sais la science
De perdre au fond d'un lit l'antique conscience.
Je sèche tous les pleurs sur mes seins triomphants,
Et fait rire les vieux du rire des enfants,
Je remplace, pour qui me voit nue et sans voiles,
La lune, le soleil, le ciel et les étoiles !
Je suis, mon cher savant, si docte aux voluptés,
Lorsque j'étouffe un homme en mes bras redoutés,
Ou lorsque j'abandonne aux morsures mon buste,
Timide et libertine, et fragile et robuste,
Que sur ces matelas qui se pâment d'émoi,
Les anges impuissants se damneraient pour moi ! ""

Quand elle eut de mes os sucé toute la moelle,
Et que languissamment je me tournai vers elle
Pour lui rendre un baiser d'amour, je ne vis plus
Qu'une outre aux flancs gluants, toute pleine de pus !
Je fermai les deux yeux, dans ma froide épouvante,
Et quand je les rouvris à la clarté vivante,
A mes côtés, au lieu du mannequin puissant
Qui semblait avoir fait provision de sang,
Tremblait confusément des débris de squelette,

De n'être pas favorisés.

O Notre-Dame des blasphèmes
Puisqu'on dit que je vous dois tout,
Vous me devez au moins mes peines,
Mais c'est un secret entre nous,
Nous n'avons plus rien à nous dire
Et que vos beaux yeux inhumains
Fassent à d'autres tous les sourires
Que vous étaliez sur mon pain.

O Notre-Dame de mes traites,
Que vous n'avez jamais payées,
Vous dont la robe bleue est faite,
De tous mes papiers bleus d'huissier,
De mes musiques sans commandes,
Je vous ai fort bien habillée,
A d'autres faites donc l'offrande
De votre riche pauvreté.

O Notre-Dame de misère
Mon coeur est au Mont de Piété,
Je l'ai laissé sur vos prières,
Mais ne peux plus l'y retirer
Pour moi que sauriez-vous donc faire,
Sinon faire un chemin de croix
Qui descendrait de mon calvaire
Où d'autres font leurs premiers pas.

O Notre-Dame de bohème
Sainte-Vierge de la purée,
Si vous voulez que je vous aime,
Vous qui m'avez bien trop aimé
Il vous reste une chose à faire,
Vous ne pouvez la refuser,
Mettez-moi sous un peu de terre,
Qui ne vous aura rien coûté.

Que les soleils marins teignaient de mille feux,
Et que leurs grands piliers, droits et majestueux,
Rendaient pareils, le soir, aux grottes basaltiques.

Mêlaient d'une façon solennelle et mystique
Les tout-puissants accords de leur riche musique
Aux couleurs du couchant reflété par mes yeux

C'est là que j'ai vécu dans les voluptés calmes,
Au milieu de l'azur, des vagues, des splendeurs,
Et des esclaves nus, tout imprégnés d'odeurs,

Like the course of our love without time
We'll never see what's behind
This elusive romance
Could be two who prove love is more than
Mere chance

Let's wait a little while
And find out why we're waiting
Amidst those parading
Desire like a torch fire
Amidst those who scramble
For love all a flutter
When true love is something subtler
We'll create if we just wait

We can't rush a happy ending
That's not in our destiny's plan
Sweet this seems we can't see
The grand scheme of our lives
Which really are what we'd share
If this romance is true
So take time to live yours
I will too while we

Wait a little while and be sure
We're not fooled
By the things we've been schooled
To take as signs that love's arrived
Like charm wit and beauty
Our youth made us seek them
But in truth we don't need them
We're in love, so let's take our time

But all the magic was used
Up on trying to uphold
Some kind of tame 
Flattering persona

Was getting real old
It takes more than pressure 
To change rock to diamond
Now all you have is sand
Slipping through your fingers

And said you needed 
Something more from my loving
But all you got was me 
And that's all that I can be
I'm sorry if it let you down

But I'm not gonna sit around
And waste 
My precious divine energy
Trying to explain 
And being ashamed of things 
You think are wrong with me
I'm not gonna sit around
And waste 
My precious divine energy
Trying to explain 
And being ashamed
Of what you think 
Is wrong with me

Set you up 
You say I set you up
Like I was different 
Than what I am

And drug your heart around
Did you forget about
All of the love 
And the acceptance 
That you promised me too?

When I reached the party everything was right
Then Babylon raid, them raid, them raid
Me gets me 'fraid, me gets me 'fraid

It was like three blind mice
You could-a see how dem run

You could-a see how dem run

Baddie sticks start flyin', man start to bawl
Some jump de fence, some put off defense
But it gets me 'fraid when Babylon raid

The police checked the deejay
Tell him to turn off sound
The crowd never like that
Them start gathering 'round

Let the music play
Let it play, let it play
Let the music play

It was like three blind mice

No man no want go a jail

Let it play, let it play

Snorting that coke, shooting that dope man you're copping out
Take my advice, it's either live or die
You've got to be strong, if you want to survive

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

By the river shore
I saw your child sleeping
Behind an open door
The moon was in the river
Shining up from the floor
And the fish swam like moonlight
Through your child's closing door
And morning is the long way home

The fisherman was drowning
By his broken heel
His screams were tiny bubbles
And his tongue made of steel
When he died his teeth made stones
For your lonely child to feel
And his eyes like prayers were quiet
When you heard his tongues of steel
And morning is the long way home

The ghost of ghosts was passing
And the grasses waved like hair

Leo Kottke,"Tilt Billings saw a guitar in a pawn shop window
Not much to look at but he knew that he'd found
That old student Prince that they made years ago
So easy to play, what unbeatable sound

Paid twenty bucks and grabbed his guitar
Still be a steal at ten times the dough
It was amazing how a mere beginner
Could play just a few notes and sound like a pro

He'd play his heart out when he was at parties
Guys would get jealous but girls were impressed
They'd ask how he did it? He'd say
""Nothin' to it, with this kind of guitar it brings out my best""

One night when he had the room captivated
He took five and set down his prince
When a drunk stumbled by and sat down where he laid it
And he's never sounded quite the same since

[Unverified]

So Tilt's still upset but he's givin' up crying
Just can't lift his eyes from the sad, sad ground
Time marches on with its fingers still trying
To find, once again, that student Prince sound

Kind of objectionable
With a heart like a fist

She stood on a street in Norfork in a pea-coat and a headache
watching the traffic splash by
When a four day clown in a pick-up truck drove her out to the woods
Down a gravel lane, down a dirt road, down some dust on the grass
To a shadow, with some bricks around it

Near a pecan tree, near a boulder, near a dog, near invisible
He dobbed his hat and scuffed his heel
And puffed real hard on his cheap cigar
And he spewed the smoke out in the air
And asked her if that was a wig on her head
Or if it was real hair

He laughed real loud and said she was cute
And then he leaned over and said ""excuse me""
And put the cigar out in the dog's face
""I live here"" he said
He went inside

She turned around and walked past the dog
Back up the dust on the grass, past the pecan tree
Back up the dirt road, back up the gravel lane
And back to Norfolk

Back there at his place late at night, when the owls congregate
And the snakes sleep, when the trucks hit the spacers in the overpass
And the storm drains cough up dust and cigarette filters
purge like frogs at the side of the road

Down some dust on the grass, past the pecan tree to the shadow
With some bricks around it

Back there, late at night, back there in the dark

Anyhow, time went by, anyhow snap crackers and stone soup
Walking on cornflakes and stopping blocks
Anyhow, she went back to where the dog blew up
She tried her luck, she went back, maybe she could paint the porch
Maybe she could fix the roof, maybe she could build a roof

Still it ain't no consolation

I'll give you some and if somebody comes
We'll let the doorbell ring

Around your pretty finger

Leo Kottke,"Mescal is free in Amanda's saloon for the boys from the old Broken Hole
Saturday nights in the town of Sonora are the best in all Mexico
They've got guitars and trumpets and sweet senoritas who won't want to let you go 
You'd never believe such a happy town had a street called Sonora's death row

Inside Amanda's we were all dancing with six of Amanda's gals
I won some silver at 7-card stud so I was outdoing my pals
But the whiskey and mescal and peso cigars drove me outside for some air 
Somebody whispered ""Your life or your money,"" I reached but my gun wasn't there

I woke up face down in Amanda's back alley, aware of the fool I had been
Rushed to a saddle and grabbed someone's rifle and entered Amanda's again
Where I saw my partners twirling my pistol and throwing my money around
Blinded by anger, I jacked the lever and one of them fell to the ground

Amanda's got silent like night in the desert, my friends stared in pure disbelief
Amanda was kneeling beside the dead cowboy plainly expressing her grief
And as I bowed my head a tremble shot through me, my pistol was still at my side
I felt my pockets and there was my money, I fell to my knees and I cried

A nightmare of mescal was all that it was, no one had robbed me at all
I wish I was dreaming the sound of the gallows they're testing just outside the wall
And the mescal's still free in Amanda's saloon for the boys from the old Broken Hole 
I'd pay a ransom to drink there today and be free of Sonora's death row",Sonora's Death Row,1991

And snakes police the roads
And a truck weighed down with misery stops and unloads
And 18 broken passengers, their blood as thick as mud 
Beg for water, for anything the driver waves good luck

The sun's been frying lizards hidden under rocks
And now it fries the refugees and turns their brains to chalk
Eighteen men and women and one brand new pair of shoes
And the driver's back at the border, what's he got to lose

The night wind screams across the freezing ground
There's no one left to tremble or to fear for him now
Their bones are scattered drifting like the snow
That falls each night and settles all around his soul

I made a lot of friends and hung out at the bank
I bought a silly house on some very silly land
If anybody asked, I said this is who I am

Happy, contented, stuffed with dollar bills
I stood like a taxidermist's elk upon a hill

Suddenly I'm stupid and the world's too big for me
I hang my head and mumble my face between my knees
I find a little cave with a sign that says for rent
It looked a lot better than my place ever did

I found a way to live there so I am no-one's fool
When I look up I grin, when I look down I drool

Leo Kottke,"I met a guy the other day he said he had it all figured out
He claimed he was ecstatic and he proved it with a shout
""I like hippie chicks,"" he said, ""they're not so damn dumb
They don't sing like Ethel Merman, they don't imitate nuns

""They comb their hair with porcupines and loofah their feet
And they become indignant when you threaten them with meat
Their windows grin like pumpkins filled with candles and beads
Their beds are all futonic and there's babies on their knees.""
""But my mother wears a hat,"" he said, ""extruded from a tank
And my sister reads good housekeeping and worships at the bank
My grandma loves Pat Robertson says he's it that's that
And my wife says I'm a lunatic but hippie chicks are where it's at.""

He told me this while revving up his brand new pick up truck
He wore a leather hat and shades above a 12-pack gut
""I know where they got hippie chicks, they're all in Santa Cruz""
Then he jammed a tape in his Blaupunkt and drove off born to lose

Cause although he got the message he was deaf to the news

The woman is louder than Pepe is but Pepe will not shut up

Pepe hush, don't make so much noise
Pepe hush, don't make so much noise

He bounds on the wall with his left foot and jumps on the bed with his right
The woman is screaming at Pepe and Pepe seems very uptight

Pepe hush, don't make so much noise
Pepe hush, don't make so much noise

He falls on the lamp with his face first and fries his nose on the bulb
He scratches his eye on the lamp shade and falls on the floor with a thud

Pepe hush, don't make so much noise
Pepe hush, don't make so much noise

That drove Pepe crazy, now Pepe knew something was up or down
The guy is completely unconscious and Pepe's got his ear to the ground

He barked for the clown at the desk
He barked for no good reason
Pepe was doing his best

Pepe hush, don't make so much noise
Pepe hush, don't make so much noise

So in a dream he advanced, he'd break that woman's arm
Her ulna did not stand a chance, but the dog would be the first thing he'd harm
He hung it outside on a power line and laughed as it emitted sparks
But when he regained his consciousness the first thing he heard was a bark

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1992

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,

To a degree.
I love the common folks.

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,

I bought a basket for my mommie
On the way I dropped it
I dropped it, I dropped it
Yes on the way I dropped it

And took it to the market
She was truckin' on down the 
Avenue without a single thing to do
She was peck, peck, peckin' all around
When she spied it on the ground

She took my yellow basket 
And if she doesn't bring it back
I think that I shall die
