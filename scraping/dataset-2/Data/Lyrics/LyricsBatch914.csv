Red Rider,"So long so long so long he's been away
So long so long so long he's back again

When I turned seventeen
We had passion, we had dreams
Thought the love we were fighting for
Was something holy, something more

When I turned twenty-one
We were outside on the run
When I walked out with my girl
We went halfway around the world

I dreamed I saw her standing there
Running for the boy inside the man
I was hit hard by the light so bright it burned
All at once I knew she'd understand
Boy inside the man
The boy inside the man
When I turned twenty-five
We were hungry, we had drive
When I turned much older then
When the boy was lost in pride

Now I just turned thirty-one
I have lost and I have won
Still I've kept my dreams alive
Cause the boy will never die

I dreamed I saw her standing there
Running for the boy inside the man
I was hit hard by the light so bright it burned
All at once I knew she'd understand
Boy inside the man
The boy inside the man
When I turned twenty-five
We were hungry, we had drive
When I turned much older then
When the boy was lost in pride

Ah do you understand

I dreamed I saw her standing there
Running for the boy inside the man
I was hit hard by the light so bright it burned
All at once I knew she'd understand
Boy inside the man
The boy inside the man
When I turned twenty-five
We were hungry, we had drive
When I turned much older then
When the boy was lost in pride

The boy inside the man
The boy inside the man
So long so long so long
You been away
So long so long so long
You're back again

Sister cool this face
As if it's carved in stone
Don't leave me in this place
Like a boy without a home
Like a boy without a home
Boy inside the man",Boy Inside the Man,2002
Red Rider,"See her by the corner
Then she walks on by
Heads turn to meet her
Steely eyed
She's her own girl
Her own design
She holds her head high
Hides her scars just fine

[Chorus:]
She makes it work out
Makes me feel
Makes me see
The untouchable one
Look and see
She's one the outside
She's with me

She's been through a lot
You can tell
As hard as it gets baby
She holds it well
Don't try to change her
No, she will not bend
But if you get close to her
She'll be your special friend
 
[Chorus]
She walks on by
You know she's walking with me
The untouchable one
Look and see
She's on the outside
She's with me
Make me feel

The untouchable one
She hides her scars real fine
She's her own design

Red Rider,"You want to be an actress
And step down on the stage
You are going to the school Julliard
To learn how to strut so high and proud
Make me stand up and notice
That you are not afraid
I believe in you
And I believe you'll have it made
I cut out my heart
And nail it away
Save it for your summer holiday
You'll forget about me
When your name is on the marquee
And the rich boys come out to play
Upon Avenue ""A""
You've got your reasons
And I've got mine
I'll nail your cards and letter on the wall
To remind me that you are still out there 
Because I won't know the girl on the screen at all
Cut out my heart
And nail it away
And save it for your summer holiday
You'll forget about me
When your name is on the marquee
And your up on Avenue ""A""
Cut out my heart
And nail it away
And save it for your summer holiday
Teach them how to laugh and feel
When they put you to the test
For there is something special in you
That you must express
Don't forget about me
When your name is on the marquee
And the rich men come to stay
Up on Avenue ""A""

Red Rider,"When he was a kid, he'd be up at five
Take shots till eight, make the thing drive
Out after school, back on ice
That was his life, he was gonna play in the big league
The big league

Not many ways out of this cold northern town
You work in the mill and get laid in the ground
If you're gonna jump it will be with the game
Real fast and tough is the only clear lane to the big league

My boy's gonna play in the big league
My boy's gonna turn some heads
My boy's gonna play in the big league
My boy's gonna knock 'em dead
The big league

All the right moves when he turned eighteen
Scholarship and school on a big u.s. team
Out with his girl near Lake Mcclean
Hit a truck doing seventy in the wrong lane
To the big league

My boy's gonna play in the big league
My boy's gonna turn some heads
My boy's gonna play in the big league
My boy's gonna knock 'em dead

Never can tell what might come down
Never can tell how much you get
Just don't know, no you never can tell

Sometimes at night I can hear the ice crack
It sounds like thunder and it rips through my back
Sometimes in the morning I still hear the sound
Ice meets metal...
""can't you drive me down to the big league?""

My boy's gonna play in the big league
My boy's gonna turn some heads
My boy's gonna play in the big league
My boy's gonna knock 'em dead

Never can tell what might come down
Never can tell when you might check out
Just don't know, no you never can tell
So do right to others like you do to yourself
In the big league",Big League,2010
Red River Dave,"There's something strange in the old corral
There's a breeze, though the wind has died
Though I'm alone in the old corral
Seems there is someone at my side

Empty saddles in the old corral
Where do you ride tonight?
Are you roundin' up the dogies, the strays of long ago
Are you on the trail of buffalo?

Empty saddles in the old corral
Where do you ride tonight?
Are there rustlers on the border, or a band of Navajo
Are you headin' for the Alamo?

Empty guns covered with rust
Where do you talk tonight?
Empty boots covered with dust
Where do you walk tonight?

Empty saddles in the old corral
My tears will be dried tonight
If you'll only say I'm lonely as you carry my old pal
Empty saddles in the old corral

There is no smoke, still the fires burn,
There's no song, still I hear guitars,
There is no dust, still the ghosts return
Softly to vanish through the bars",Empty Saddles,2005
Red Roche,"The love has gone
The love has gone, baby

I didn't get it when he hung up the phone
He said that he's all alone
And that's when I heard her moan, I get it
It's not a secret 'cause he's working till late
But then he doesn't come home
And now he's switched off the phone, I get it

Tell me something baby, tell me this ain't true
Tell me something baby, tell me this ain't true
I won't be crying for you no more, baby

The love has gone, that took me higher
Now you've gone and left me, boy you've wasted my time
It's breaking my heart, you know this ain't fair
I deserve better, but you don't even care

I'm taking back my, my heart from his hands
He's got another lover so I'm taking a stand
I've sat and watched our, our love drift away
I looked into his eyes and he had nothing to say

Tell me something baby, tell me this ain't true
Tell me something baby, tell me this ain't true

You had me baby and now we're through

Red Rockers,"Danced with wind and danced with fire
Killed the truth and called the liar
Bleeding in its mystery when the moon began to fall
Dreamers are not all they seem,
Sleeping in her silent dream
She locks it all inside and hides it all away

China, China

Calling out to history
Is that the way it will always be?

China, China

Questions in my hand, and then
Answers gone till I don't know when

verse:
All you speak and all you hear
Hand that's strong and voice it's clear
An unforgotten memory when the moon begins to call
Called you right and called you wrong
Time, the shadow, sings your song
Don't lock it all inside and hide it all away

China, China 4x",China,1994
Red Rodney,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1973
Red Rodney,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay

",On Green Dolphin Street,1974
Red Rodney,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,1992
Red Rodney,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1994
Red Rodney,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.

Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong, the man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile; I'll understand
And in a little while he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam; who would? Would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love",The Man I Love,1995
Red Rodney,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You,1996
Red Rodney,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1996
Red Rodney,"I may be wrong but I think you're wonderful
I may be wrong but I think you're swell
I like your style say, I think it's marvelous
I'm always wrong so how can I tell

Deuces to me are all aces
Life is to me just a bore
Faces are all open spaces
You might be John Barrymore
You came along say I think you're wonderful
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

I may be wrong but I think you're wonderful
I may be wrong but I think you're swell
I like your style say, I really think it's marvelous
I'm always wrong so how can I tell

Life is to me just a bore
Faces are all open spaces

You came along say I think you're wonderful
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

You laughed at Mr. Franklin with his key and kite

Red Rodney,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,2001
Red Rodney,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2001
Red Rodney,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,2001

And wanna cry but the melody keeps haunting me

Or how we took that curve over on 66
Hadn'y been for me hangin on the shoulder

Why couldn't he have put me over there next to that little pink Mack?
Gosh she's got pretty mud-flaps
And talk about stacked, they're both chromed
Well he'll be coming out in a minute and he'll get that bar and he'll go around and beat on my tires
You know for two pints of diesel
I'd have a flat on the inside dual
Ha! Boy that'd fix him
I never did like the way he drives anyhow
Thinks he's God's gift of waitresses

Said he keeps talkin' about his daddy that he hardly knows

And here lately it's showing on me too
I saw a lot of country at first and I really like it then
But anymore there's just none of it new

I guess I've drove about all of 'em
Cause for the past 25 years now the cab of a truck has been my home
And it'd be kinda hard for me to settle down and not be on the go
Why I remember the first truck I drove
I was so proud I could hardly wait to get home to show my wife and my little boy
And my little boy was so excited like so when he saw his first snow
He wasn't old enough to say too many words
He just kept hollering goddyup go daddy giddyup go
So that's what I named the old truck Giddyup go
Oh things wasn't too bad of course I's gone a lot
And after about six years I got home one day and found my wife and little boy gone
I couldn't find out what happened nobody seemed to know
So from that day on it's been me and old Giddyup go
I've made a lot of friends at all the truck stops
And some of 'em would kick me about my litle sign
Of course they knew where I got the name
Cause I told 'em about that little boy of mine
And how his first word about that old truck was Giddyup go
Today I was barrelin' down old 66
When up beside me pulled down a brand new diesel rig
Both stacks of blowin' black coal
And as she pulled around and back in front of me a big lump came in my throat
And my eyes watered like I had a bad old cold
A little sign on the back of the truck that read Giddyup go
Well I pushed old Giddyup go stayed right on him
Until the next truck stop where he'd pulled up
I waited till he went in and I offered to buy him a cup
Well we got to talkin' shop and I said
Now did you come by the name on your truck Giddyup go
Well he said I got it from my pop
Dad used to drive a truck that's what mom talked about a lot
You see I lost mom when I was just past sixteen and I lost all track of pop
Mom said he got the name from me
I shook his hand and told him that I had something I wanted him to see
I took him out to the old truck
And brushed off some of the dirt so the name would show
And his eyes got big and bright as he read Giddyup go
Oh we had a lot of things to talk about and buddy I felt like a king
And now we've just pulled back on old 66 and he's handled that big rig
Better than any gearjammer that I'd ever seen
Well now the lines on the highway have got much brighter glow

I've urned my back upon my mother's crys
I've looked into my mind when we were starving
And asked myself the question who am I

I've searched the eyes of strangers in the alley
And seen the learching looks that they return
I've read the books the scholars recommended
And trembled at the likes of what I learned
I've slept out in the night when it was raining
I've shivered at the lightning in the sky
I've looked into my mind while I was freezing
And asked myself the question who am I

I've seen the spinning world from in the gutter
And felt the kin to men who leave their wives
I've searched and finally found the perfect woman
And learned too late she never could be mine

buck 
And things didn't work out, I was down on my luck 
Got tired a-roamin' and bummin' around 
So I started thumbin' back East, toward my home town.

Made a lot of miles, the first two days 
And I figured I'd be home in week, if my luck held out this way 
But, the third night I got stranded, way out of town 
At a cold, lonely crossroads, rain was pourin' down.

I was hungry and freezin', done caught a chill
When the lights of a big semi topped the hill Lord, I sure was glad to hear them air brakes come on 
And I climbed in that cab, where I knew it'd be warm.

At the wheel sit a big man, he weighed about two-ten 
He stuck out his hand and said with a grin 
""Big Joe's the name"", I told him mine 
And he said: ""The name of my rig is Phantom 309.""

I asked him why he called his rig such a name 
He said: ""Son, this old Mack can put 'em all to shame 
There ain't a driver, or a rig, a-runnin' any line 
Ain't seen nothin' but taillights from Phantom 309.""

Well, we rode and talked the better part of the night 
When the lights of a truck stop came in sight
He said: ""I'm sorry son, this is as far as you go 
'Cause, I gotta make a turn, just on up the road.""

Well, he tossed me a dime as he pulled her in low 
And said: ""Have yourself a cup on old Big Joe.""
When Joe and his rig roared out in the night
In nothin' flat, he was clean out of sight.

Well, I went inside and ordered me a cup 
Told the waiter Big Joe was settin' me up 
Aw!, you coulda heard a pin drop, it got deathly quiet 
And the waiter's face turned kinda white.

Well, did I say something wrong? I said with a halfway grin 
He said: ""Naw, this happens every now and then
Ever' driver in here knows Big Joe 
But son, let me tell you what happened about ten years ago.

At the crossroads tonight, where you flagged him down 
There was a bus load of kids, comin' from town
And they were right in the middle, when Big Joe topped the hill 
It could have been slaughter, but he turned his wheel.

Well, Joe lost control, went into a skid A
nd gave his life to save that bunch-a kids 
And there at that crossroads, was the end of the line 
For Big Joe and Phantom 309

But, every now and then, some hiker'll come by
And like you, Big Joe'll give 'em a ride 
Here, have another cup and forget about the dime
Keep it as a souvenir, from Big Joe and Phantom 309!""",Phantom 309,1978
Red Sovine,"The highways that wind and wander
Over mountains, valleys, and deserts, and plains --
Ahh, I guess I've drove about all of them,
‘Cause for the past twenty-five years now,
The cab of a truck has been my home,
And it would be kind of hard for me to settle down
And not be on the go.

Why, I remember the first truck I drove;
I was so proud I could hardly wait
To get home and show my wife and little boy;
And my little boy was so excited,
Like when he saw his first snow.
Not being quite old enough to speak,
He wasn't old enough to say too many words,
He kept a-hollering, “Giddyup go, Daddy, Giddyup go.”
So that's what I named the old truck: Giddyup Go.

Ahh, things wasn't too bad;
‘Course, I was gone an awful lot,
And after about six years of being in and out,
I got home one day and found my wife and little boy gone;
And I couldn't find out what happened;
Nobody seemed to know,
So from that day on, it's been me
And old Giddyup Go.

Oh, I've made a lot of friends at all the truck stops,
And Some of them would kid me about my little sign,
‘Cause they knew where I had got the name;
‘Cause I'd told them about that little boy of mine,
And how his first word about the truck was “Giddyup go.”

Well, today I was barreling down Old 66,
When up beside me pulled a brand new diesel rig,
Both stacks blowing black coal,
And as he pulled around and back in front of me,
A big lump came in my throat,
And my eyes watered like I had a bad old cold.
A little sign on the back of the truck that read,
“Giddyup go.”

Well, I pushed old giddy up and stayed right on him,
‘Til the next truck stop where he pulled up.
And I waited ‘til he went in,
And I offered to buy him a cup;
Well we got to talking shop, and I said,
“How'd you come by that name on your truck -- Giddyup Go?”
“Well,” he said, “I got it from my pop.
Dad use to drive a truck;
That's what Mom talked about a lot.
You see, I lost Mom when I was just past 16,
And I lost all track of Pop.
Mom said he got the name from me.”

Well I shook his hand and told him
I had something I wanted him to see,
And took him out to the old truck,
And brushed off some of the dirt so the name would show.
And his eyes got big and bright
As he read “Giddyup Go.”

Oh, we had a lot of things to talk about,
And, buddy, I felt like a king,
And now we've just pulled back on Old 66,
And he handled that rig better
Than any gear jammer that I've ever seen.
Now the lines on the highway have got a much brighter glow,
As we go roaring down the road,
And me staring at that little sign
That reads “Giddyup Go.”

I dreamed about Mama last night
She read me the Bible as she used to do
I dreamed about Mama last night

She never closed her eyes to sleep
Till we were all in bed
And on party nights till we came home
She always sat and read

We had little thought about it then
For we were young and gay
Just how much Mama worried
When we children were away

We only knew she never slept
While we were out at night
That she waited just to know
That we'd all come home alright

And sometimes when we'd stay away
Till 1 or 2 or 3
It seemed to us that Mama heard
The turning of the key

For always when we'd step inside
She'd call and we'd reply
We were all too young back then
To understand the reason why

Till the last one had returned
She always kept a light
For Mama couldn't sleep until
She'd kissed us all good night

She had to know we were safe
Before she went to rest
For she always feared the world might harm
The ones she loved the best

Once she said, ""When you are grown
To women and to men
Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through
It might be different then""

So it seemed that night and day
We knew our mother's care
For always when we got back home
We found her waiting there

Then came the day
We were called together 'round her bed
""The children are all with ya now""
The kindly doctor said

Then in her eyes there gleamed again
That old-time tender light
That told that she waited
Just to know we made it home alright

She smiled that old familiar smile
And prayed to God to keep
Her children safe from harm throughout the years
And then she went asleep

My dream is a treasure that I'll always keep

If he came without warning, I wonder what you'd do.

Yes if Jesus came to your house, to spend a day or two.
If he came unexpected, just dropped in on you.

And all the food you'd serve to him, would be your the best.
And you would keep reassuring him, that you're glad to have him there.
That serving him in your home, is joy beyond compare.
But when you saw him coming, would you meet him at the door,
With arms out stretched in welcome, to your heavenly visitor.
Or would you have to change you clothes, before you'd let him in.
Or hide some magazines, and put the bible where they had been.
Would you turn off the radio, and hope he hadn't heard.
And wish you hadn't uttered, that last loud hasty word.
Would you hide your worldly music, and put some hymn books out.
Could you just let Jesus walk right in, or would you rush about.
And I wonder, if the savior spent a day or two with you.
Would you go right on doing, the things you always do.
Would you go right on saying, the things you always say.
Would life for you continue, as it does from day to day.
Would your family conversations, keep up its normal pace.
And would you find it hard each meal to say a table grace.
Would you sing the songs you always sing,
And read the books you read.
And let him know the things on which you mind and spirit feed.
Would you take Jesus with you everywhere you planned to go.
Or maybe would you change your plans, for just a day or so.
Would you be glad for him meet your very closest friends.
Or hope that they'd stay away, until his visit ends.
Would you be glad to have him stay forever on and on.

We sat there a playing house,
While the Dodgers played the Braves
And everyone in the bleachers, looked at us as if to say.

I recall the day, I took you on a fishing trip.
You said ""Daddy, won't that hook, hurt the fishes lip?""
And you said ""If they don't get air,
Those things in the can will die""
So we turned the worms all loose.
And chased some butterflies.

I recall the day, That your young man come to call.
Seems like only yesterday,
When you swam and played football.
But I know the time has come,
That I must set you free.
But no matter where you are,
You know what you are to me!

Red Sovine,"(She's the one got lonely I didn't jump the fence)
Mr Angry neighbor yes I know just how you feel
Cause I've been taking your fruit but don't tell me I steal
I haven't been in your yard my tracks ain't on your ground
Your tree hangs over my fence the nights you're not around
I didn't jump the fence the fruit was offered free
I couldn't reach your apples if you just trimmed the tree
Well sure I've held your darling but Mister where's your sense
She's the one got lonely I didn't jump the fence

Now friend you see that little trail that runs between our home
These ain't the shoes that wore it there the nights that you were gone
So don't show me your anger or shout I stole a kiss
When she did all the walking I didn't jump the fence
I didn't jump the fence...




",I Didn't Jump the Fence,1989
Red Sovine,"We just finished our dinner and
I'd gone in the den and turned on the TV.
When she walked in and kissed me
on the cheek like a million times before.
And she said ""Honey, I know It's late.
But if you don't mind, My shoppings gotten a little behind.
So I think I'll drive downtown to the grocery store.""

Well.. I didn't look up, Just nodded OK and asked her to
hand me an ashtray.
And when she did, I reached over and squeezed
her hand, And then she left.
And I shuddered a minute
At the thought of my world without her in it.
And I reassuringly sought the touch
of my wedding band.

Well.. I musta been dozing,
'cause I didn't hear the door.
And I thought now that's strange,
I've never done that before.
But I looked up, And she was standing by my chair.
""Kinda snucked in on me"" I said,
And she smiled and nodded her head.
And I told her that she looked just like an angel
standing there.

For a long moment she didn't say a thing.
And then she caressed her gold wedding ring.
And I thought I saw a tear drop in her eye.
""Honey, You'll never know how much I love you""
She said.

And I thought of the many years that we had been wed.
As I told her that no one could be as happy as I.
And then the strangest feeling filled the room.
Not one of happiness but one of gloom.
And for the first time in my life, I saw sadness in her face.
I reached out to touch her, and she drew away.
And she told be again, That ours was a love..
That time could never erase.

And then I thought I heard a thousand voices singing
But I realized it was the telephone ringing.
And that's when I saw the halo
Surround her pretty golden hair.

I turned trembling to the receiver and heard a cold voice
say there had been a wreck out on the highway.
And I knew that when I looked back, She wouldn't be there.
Because it was an angels way of saying our last goodbye.",The Last Goodbye,1989
Red Sovine,"(Little Rosa was her name and still I cry in vain
My world won't be the same since she's gone from me)

I have gone to visit the grave of a friend of mine and as I walked thru the grave yard
I noticed this man kneeling down by the grave of a child
And in his hand he held a big red rose and tears were streaming down his cheeks
I walked over and laid a hand on his shoulder and started to talk to him
And during the course of our conversation and in his broken English
This is the story just as he told it to me
He said to me Mister I've walked down the street today
And I passed about the big flower shop
I walked in and I asked the man in the shop I said boss how much is for one red rose
Then he looked at me with one big frown and he says it's one dollar please
But in a buyin' buyer was well dressed blonde lady walked in
And she says how much is for one red rose
And he looked at her with one big smile and he says ten cents
Now I said boss how come to you to charge me a dollar for the rose
And you charged the young lady only ten cents
Then he said look Mister you tell me why you want the rose
And maybe I give it to you for not
I said boss I'm a hard working man working a railroad and gonna make too much money
And I got a little girl and her name was Rosa o Rosa's just about this high boss
Every day when I'd come home from the work
A little Rosa come running to meet her papa
And she'd throw her little arms around my neck and say papa and I'd say Rosa
But one day boss I've come home from the work I don't see Rosa
I looked down by the railroad track and I see one big crowd
I'd go down and I pushed the crowd this a way and pushed the crowd that a way
There was at my feet lay my little Rosa and that's why I want the rose boss
I wanna put it on little Rosa's grave
Then man he didn't say not but he picked the biggest and the reddest rose
And he gave it to me
And I said thank you boss thank you very much

To me she'll always be that little girl of mine",Little Rosa,1989
Red Sovine,"I was on the outskirts of a little southern town
Tryin' to reach my destination before the sun went down
The old CB was blarin' away on channel 1-9!
 When there came a little boy's voice on the radio line

And he said: ""Breaker 1-9! Is anyone there?
 ome on back, truckers and talk to Teddy Bear!""
Well, I keyed the mike and said: ""You got it, Teddy Bear!""
 And a little boy's voice came back on the air

""'Preciate the break,  Who we got on that end?""
   I told him my handle, and, then he began:
""Now, I'm not supposed to bother you fellows out there
   Mom says you're busy and for me to stay off the air

But you see, I get lonely and it helps to talk
   'Cause that's about all I can do, I'm crippled, and, I can't walk!""
I came back and told him to fire up that mike
   And I'd talk to him, as long as he liked

""This was my dad's radio"", the little boy said
   ""But I guess it's mine and mom's now, 'cause my daddy's dead!""
""Dad had a wreck about a month ago
   He was trying to get home in a blindin' snow

Mom has to work now, to make ends meet
   And I'm not much help, with my two crippled feet!""
""She says not to worry that we'll make it alright
   But, I hear her crying, sometimes late at night

You know there's just one thing I want more than anything else to see
   Aw, I know you guys are too busy to bother with me!""
""But, you see, my dad used to take me for rides when he was home
   But, I guess that's all over now, since my daddy's gone

Not one breaker came on the old CB
   As that little crippled boy talked with me
I tried hard to swallow a lump that just wouldn't stay down
   As I thought about my boy back in Greenville Town

""Dad was going to take mom and me with him later on this year, Why,
   l remember 'I'm saying: 'Someday this old truck will be yours, Teddy Bear!'
But, I know I'll never get to ride an 18-wheeler again
   But, this old base will keep me in touch with all my trucker friends!""

""Teddy Bear's gonna back on out now and leave you alone
   'Cause it's about time for mom to come home
But, you give me a shout when you're passin' through
   And I'll sure be happy to come back to you!""

Well, I came back and I said: uh! ""Before you go 10-10
   What's your home 20, little CB friend?""
Well, he gave me his address and I didn't once hesitate
   'Cause this hot load of freight was just gonna have to wait

I turned that truck around on a dime
   And headed straight for Jackson Street, 229
And as I rounded the corner, oh, I got one heck of a shock
   late wheelers were lined up for three city blocks!

Why, I guess every driver for miles around had caught Teddy Bear's call
   And that little crippled boy was having a ball
For as fast as one driver would carry him in
   Another would carry him to his truck and take off again

Well, you better believe I took my turn at riding Teddy Bear
   And then I carried him back in and put him down in his chair
And buddy if I never live to see happiness again
   I want you to know I saw it that day, in the face of that little man

We took up a collection for him before his mama got home
   And each driver said goodbye and then they all were gone
He shook my hand with a mile-long grin
   And said: ""So long, trucker I'll catch ya again!""

Well, I hit the Interstate with tears in my eyes
   I turned on the radio and I got another surprise
""Breaker 1-9!"" Came a voice on the air
   ""Just one word of thanks from Mama Teddy Bear!""

""We wish each and every one, a special prayer for you
   'Cause, You just made my little boy's dream come true
I'll sign off now, before, I start to cry
   May God ride with you, 10-4, and goodbye.""",Teddy Bear,1989

Maybe, it's left for you
If you're among the lucky ones
And that found a love that's true

I was looking through the morning paper
Like a lot of us do every day
When I saw an ad that caught my eye
This is what it had to say

One dream house for sale
It's a bargain from nothing down
And there's no closing cost for the dreams
I lost when the girl I loved left town

There's five rooms and bath on an acre of land
And the nursery painted pink and blue
A baby bed and a little white high chair
And it's all almost brand new

There's a set out old dog in a picket fence
Around the yard that's full of weeds
Why, just one look and it's easy to see
A little love is all that it needs

Dream house for sale
If you found a love that's true

The only thing wrong with this house of mine
Is the black cloud that hangs above
I guess it's there to keep out the sunshine
Since mine's a house without love

That's just about all there is to tell
About a boy and his love that failed
Four words tell the rest of my story

I was driving down a lonely road on a dark and stormy night
When a little girl by the road side showed up in my head lights
I stopped and she got in the back and in a shaky tone
She said my name is Mary please won't you take me home
She must have been so frightened all alone there in the night
There was something strange about her cause her face was deathly white
She sat so pale and quiet there in the back seat all alone
I never will forget that night I took Mary home
I pulled into the driveway where she told me to go
Got out to help her from the car and opened up the door
But I just could not believe my eyes the back seat was bare
I looked all around the car but Mary wasn't there
A small light shown from the porch a woman opened up the door
I asked about the little girl that I was looking for
Then the lady gently smiled and brushed a tear away
She said it sure was nice of you to go out of your way
But thirteen years ago today in a wreck just down the road
Our darling Mary lost her life and we srill miss her so
So thank you for your trouble and the kindness you have shown
You're the thirteenth one who's been here bringing Mary home
You're the thirteenth one who's been here bringing Mary home

I guess I've drove about all of 'em
Cause for the past 25 years now the cab of a truck has been my home
And it'd be kinda hard for me to settle down and not be on the go
Why I remember the first truck I drove
I was so proud I could hardly wait to get home to show my wife and my little boy
And my little boy was so excited like so when he saw his first snow
He wasn't old enough to say too many words
He just kept hollering goddyup go daddy giddyup go
So that's what I named the old truck Giddyup go
Oh things wasn't too bad of course I's gone a lot
And after about six years I got home one day and found my wife and little boy gone
I couldn't find out what happened nobody seemed to know
So from that day on it's been me and old Giddyup go
I've made a lot of friends at all the truck stops
And some of 'em would kick me about my litle sign
Of course they knew where I got the name
Cause I told 'em about that little boy of mine
And how his first word about that old truck was Giddyup go
Today I was barrelin' down old 66 
When up beside me pulled down a brand new diesel rig
Both stacks of blowin' black coal
And as she pulled around and back in front of me a big lump came in my throat
And my eyes watered like I had a bad old cold
A little sign on the back of the truck that read Giddyup go
Well I pushed old Giddyup go stayed right on him 
Until the next truck stop where he'd pulled up
I waited till he went in and I offered to buy him a cup
Well we got to talkin' shop and I said
Now did you come by the name on your truck Giddyup go
Well he said I got it from my pop
Dad used to drive a truck that's what mom talked about a lot
You see I lost mom when I was just past sixteen and I lost all track of pop
Mom said he got the name from me
I shook his hand and told him that I had something I wanted him to see
I took him out to the old truck
And brushed off some of the dirt so the name would show
And his eyes got big and bright as he read Giddyup go
Oh we had a lot of things to talk about and buddy I felt like a king
And now we've just pulled back on old 66 and he's handled that big rig
Better than any gearjammer that I'd ever seen

Redd,"Got to do something for the playas if you ain't a real playa
You'll have to go to the back of the club, this for the playas
And the ballas and the pimps, for everybody, south side
Who rocking lots of ice, teeth shine, piece shine
Pull up looking clean on two twenty's nigga

Put your fist up if you wearing a Rolex
Put your wrist up, grab your Styrofoam
Cups of drink mixed up if your car broke down
Get it fixed up playas put your fist up

Let your piece shine if you got diamonds in your grill
Let your teeth shine and when we at the club
We be creased down, you ain't never seen
No playa like me, don't ball with sucka free

I just put some new rugs in my two story club
Hoes getting dug in my king size tub
Boys getting drugged, trying to act like a thug
No fucking love while I sip purple mud
I fly like a dove, smoke like a champ

Never run from no one 'cause I might catch a cramp
Smoking damp, fucking on a old school tramp
Ten dollar rock for a twenty food stamp
My name is Carlos holla fuck these hoes
Life is like ballet stay on your toes

My dream is to keep the world up all night
'Cause I got enough 'caine to have a snowball fight
I floss gators, got cribs with elevators
So much cash I bought a pool for my neighbors
Dope house and sucka free, run your ass up a tree
Fuck with me and you'll be keeping dad company

Put your fist up if you wearing a Rolex
Put your wrist up, grab your Styrofoam
Cups of drink mixed up if your car broke down
Get it fixed up playas put your fist up

Let your piece shine if you got diamonds in your grill
Let your teeth shine and when we at the club
We be creased down, you ain't never seen
No playa like me, don't ball with sucka free

When I walk into the club people say, ?Where he go??
But when I open up my mouth they be like, ?There he go?
When Redd sliding through the club I'm throwing my elbows
Any girl I snag, she sticking like velcrow
And when I take my watch off, they say, ?Who cut the lights off??

And I can freestyle all night until they cut the mics off
As soon as I touch the stage, broads ain't paging they man
Instead they spilling liquor, waving they hands
Well I'm a valet parker and a endo sparker
So many waves in my hair I got to wear swimming goggles

Now we ready to buy the bar tossing shit the counter
People notice my name and run over the [unverified]
Now when you see me in the club, I'm dressed top of the line
I'm mixing up codeine and popping bottles of wine
I met a chicken head from Michigan showing her tattoo
Hit it off at the bar too, let's scram so we could car pool

Put your fist up if you wearing a Rolex
Put your wrist up, grab your Styrofoam
Cups of drink mixed up if your car broke down
Get it fixed up playas put your fist up

Let your piece shine if you got diamonds in your grill
Let your teeth shine and when we at the club
We be creased down, you ain't never seen
No playa like me, don't ball with sucka free

Hey, this for my Blacks, Asians, Chinese and Caucasians
Muslims, Irish and even Jamaicans, Hispanics, Indians
Throw your sets up and all the fine women, raise your dress up
Hold up your piece if you got ice in it
And put your white cups up if you got pink sprite in it

You might see me at the bar but I don't drink that much
I just bought an Escallade and I'm gone paint that truck
I got three million in the bank, but it ain't that much
Now when I look at magazines I say ain't that us
I'm in the VIP section, wearing a black dob

I got the women screaming whoa but my name ain't Black Rob
Man, they screaming Lil' Flip at the front of the club
A nigga buzzed off this remmy with a blunt and a hug
When sucka free in the club women lose they brains
If I need ice in my cup, then I use my chain, bling bling

Put your fist up if you wearing a Rolex
Put your wrist up, grab your Styrofoam
Cups of drink mixed up if your car broke down
Get it fixed up playas put your fist up

Let your piece shine if you got diamonds in your grill
Let your teeth shine and when we at the club
We be creased down, you ain't never seen
No playa like me, don't ball with sucka free

She makes it just right
That extra grenadine got me feelin’ so nice
Her body’s so tight up under that light

5 foot 8, on a lake, what a date
She fell for the hook and the bait
I took her to the yacht, for shrimp and steak
Then I took her to the gym, so she could get in shape
What a night, no more drama, just late night thrills
Nigga in the hood with the gangsta grillz
Fillin’ out stacks of bills, jaguar like Jacksonville
Breakin’ these hoes like Jacks and Jill

I’m lookin’ at the most beautiful thang in the world
Her body so perfect and spinnin’ like a cinnamon swirl
She looks like a fairy tale, but yet feels so natural
This one’s a beast, but way too wonderful to be compared to an animal

Redd Eyezz,"I know y'all listen to my music (red eyes) 
But what I'm a do know is try and describe my life to y'all

Sometimes I fell like I'm loosing it 
My life is upside down 
A gift and a curse that's my life now 
There is no looking or turning back 
I used to watch coke turn to crack that's what made me turn to rap
I fell like Keanu Reeves in the movie Devils Advocate 
Confused but blessed with extravagance 
I thank god for all the opportunities 
Given the opportunity dem boys would put two in me (bla bla bla)
We live in the land of the free, hustlers and thieves 
I made money now I got uncle Sam hustling 
Me for a quarter of what I make 
Hand a quarter sentence to a fake and watch them turn state (that's right)
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)
Until the fed's step in (that's just the way it is) 
Most of these fools are characters 
Men with no character welcome to America 
Where we fight for freedom 
If ain't about oil than we don't need them 
Ain't that the truth? 
Pitbull I'm just tell y'all the way I fell 
Thank god that god made me to keep it real

[Chorus]
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)
Until the fed's step in (that just the way it is)
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)
Till that fame step in (that's just the way it is)
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)
Till dem bitches step in (that's just the way it is)
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)
Till that money step in (that's just the way it is)

Huh hun yo 
After the turf war the smoke clears 
All these years around these busta I'm convinced there ain't no hope here
In the past four years of my lifetime 
I witness leaders sacrifice freedom just to get this pipeline
Guess I'm chosen at the right time mama stress
Facing the table and she's snorting up white line 
Blood is thicker than water
In a few cases your daughter can have touched for the money that in dem suit case 
Tighten my shoelaces the fugitive running 
In fear of a criminal past 'cause dem folks is coming 
I've been wrongfully judged being from this environment 
The city gangs planning retirement 
I'm a a Dade nigga 
Voicing my set 'cause a spray quick 
Took some of the same steps through little Haiti 
As these main nigga (like who) hit man, big dog, and she hound 
Y'all predict it back then shit I see it know

[Chorus]

I escape poverty (poverty) 
I don't own jewelry motherfucker I own property 
You can send dem tsunamis that hit Indonesia (but but but) 
Ain't no motherfucking thing stopping me 
Like good coke I'm a good swimmer 
God knows I done lost but god dam I'm a good winner
It feels great to make something out of nothing 
Yea I'm humble but I tell y'all to push a chicos buttons 
And watch how them thing get to dumping 
Real estate New York game now you saying something 
I only talk about what I know about 
Illegal turn legal this year that's what I'm all about
I'm from the south and I ain't gonna lie 
At fist time I preach ye till god struck me with pride 
I was confused now I'm like let's ride 
Three o five till I die 
Three o five till I die 

[Chorus]",Blood Is Thicker Than Water,2006
Redd Eyezz,"[Chorus: x2]
Keep talkin' out the side of your mouth (pow!)
Smack the taste right up out of your mouth (pow!)
""I wa', I wa'"" That's what I'm talkin' about (pow!)
Keep talkin' out the side of your mouth (pow!)

Since I hit the TV now I'm a hot topic
But that don't mean Skipper won't pop it
Ain't that that dude with the H2 and the nice wallet?
And I got four words, stay off my dick
You wanna make it to where Skip ain't got shit
So you could ride around town and spread your gossip
Make up stories like ""U.T.P. done dropped Skip""
""Juve' used the man, paid him and then got rich""
C'mon stop it, you're makin' it up
Damn, how much hate is enough, boy you faker than fuck
""I just saw Skip blazin' it up
With a dime piece, smilin', gettin' head in the truck
Look, right now he headed for us"" (Look!)
""You lyin' motherfucker, dude he right behind 'em, you a busta""
Cause that's your old lady he with
Them hoes is for everbody, stop savin' a bitch

[Chorus: x2]

Open my eyes when the sun rise, blazin'
First nigga on the strip, even if my block's hotter than Cajun
I cop them Haitan, Jamaicans, Cubans and Yanks
Program with every race, now I cuts my own steak
Known to take G trips to a town like Wimbleton
Get a bust' down spot and be servin' like Wimbledon
Black John McEnroe, my rap flows are clapped (uh-hu)
Supposed to be hot as Tabasco, look at them assholes now
Homie, when I'm seen there's a crowd
With head bustas off the streets talkin' loud, ready to wild
Get respect for a few things
Deranged, the chopper spit
And the first off the block to cop a new Range
Life is fast, I get cash and write about it
At night it ain't safe in the South, we bout it bout it
Doubt it and get bodied 'cause the shotty will lift,
Your big muscleman bodyguard off his shit

[Chorus: x2]

Who lil' daddy with the fitted cap turned back?
Know some of these niggas got respect, he tryin' to earn that
Hopefully one of these niggas with yayo will see that
And put him in the right position he tryin' to be at
They talkin' in the wind but they no better than the play though
They could make a carton or a t-shirt in a day though
I ain't tryin' to flex my power bitch but I got say so
And I could make a million; American, yen or peso
They say I got a attitude, that's not the issue at all
Don't get involved when I'm doin' what I have to do
I'm suttle now but I could turn into an animal
Blow it out of proportion and I ain't understandin' you
Not in it for the short, I want the long term
Fuck the government, I'm a take care of my own children
You gon' have to zip your lip up, before a nigga flip up
I don't think they understandin' me, holler at 'em Skipper

Of transportation, for the Nubian nation

Navigatin' lost, somethin' like a ship's captain

I'd listened to the radio
Waitin' for my favourite songs
When they played I'd sing along
It made me smile

Those were such happy times
And not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again
Just like a long lost friend
All the songs I loved so well

Every Wo-wo-wo

Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That they're starting to sing's
So fine

Where he's breakin' her heart
It can really make me cry
Just like before
It's yesterday once more

Lookin' back on how it was
In years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed

It was songs of love that
I would sing to then
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies
Still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away

Every Wo-wo-wo
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling

And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""

Off they go, nice and slow

Knowing things would never be the same

I still remember, through the weathering of time,
That first embrace that sealed our doom
 
Your eyes stare at me from every storefront
And your voice calls to me from every restaurant

And I don't want the ignorance
That a spotless mind would bring,
But I'm scared my dying breath may be your name

Everyone knows that we live in a world
Where people give bad names to beautiful things
And if it's really true that people should leav
Once they've got what they came for,
I certainly hope that you're holding it close to you now

You cannot wait for the summer
You already hot, I'm already hot
No sweat, no Under Armor
Louboutin spice, all your good nights
Holla back, if you need a sponsor
Yeah I, ain't that Mr. Alright
Come around, with a few more commas
Come here girl, do what I gotta talk rose petals
See me with lil' mama, kinda make you jealous
Yeah be a honor, gotta say you special
Beat it like a drummer girl, you better be careful
Comprende, what's a bit late
Like Fredrick I'll be jet lagged
Calling on you this moment, this instant
What I do is just basic instinct

You see me all over her, you want me all over you (you, you, you, you)
Soon as I get rid of her, tell me what you wanna do (do, do, do, do, do)

I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I
I wanna get you alone so we can do something wrong
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna

Head start, she got that shorty
On your marks, til the shots get started
Can you level on the rocks Bacardi
Relay comes the after-party
Pass the bottles, level up get naughty
Full speed, hurry up put your body
Trackmatic horse Ferrari
Need a freak, of course I'm sorry
You ain't get the memo, they made em get low
See the finish the line, look a lot like limbo
Yeah we going we in, no night like tempo
There's another bad chick make light most simple
Mr Brenda, no beginner, first place, tryna make you winner
Yeah baby, my Brenda, I'll be waiting in the spot descender

You see me all over her, you want me all over you (you, you, you, you)
Soon as I get rid of her, tell me what you wanna do (do, do, do, do, do)

I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I

I wanna get you alone so we can do something wrong
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna

Yo, we in the spot, the club is hot
And if you wanna party rock, say hell yeah (hell yeah!)
Non stop, the bottles popped,
And if you want another shot, say hell yeah (hell yeah!)
Yo, I'm gonna run to you so you can have a little bit of fun with Foo
I know what you wanna do, when I wiggle wiggle wiggle in my Underoos
Got you wet, dripping like SoCo
Never should've let you bounce on my pogo
Now you wanna be my Yoko Ono
So you roll stop acting like you don't know
Fool, I'm running through these hoes like Drano
But I keep it low pro, 'cause she's my main hoe
I got your tickets, they're on Fandango
Back room, no fro, I'll be eating a mango!

I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I

And the Anzac legends didn't mention mud and blood and tears
And the stories that my father told me never seemed quite real
I caught some pieces in my back that I didn't even feel

And I can still see Frankie, drinkin' tinnies in the Grand Hotel
On a thirty-six hour rec. leave in Vung Tau
And I can still hear Frankie, lying screaming in the jungle
'Til the morphine came and killed the bloody row

And the Anzac legends didn't mention mud and blood and tears
And the stories that my father told me never seemed quite real
I caught some pieces in my back that I didn't even feel
God help me 
I was only nineteen

And can you tell me, doctor, why I still can't get to sleep?
And why the Channel Seven chopper chills me to my feet?
And what's this rash that comes and goes
Can you tell me what it means?
God help me
I was only nineteen",I Was Only 19 (A Walk in the Light Green),2004
Redheart,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

Gonna have a fine vacation
Gonna take my problem
To the United Nations
Well' I went to my congressman
He said 'quote'
'I'd like to help you son,
But you're too young to vote'

Sometimes I wonder what am I gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues",Summertime Blues,2007
Redman,"Party people, your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get your ass up, and let's get ill
That's right y'all, we more than rough, we callin' your bluff
And when it comes to rhymes
Yo, don't scandalize mine
I spent too much time
Straight talk with the catch to etch my line walk
Never fetchin' for crime, halt! Who goes there?

Yo, it's the squeeze of five fingers, puffin Smokey the Bear
Shinin' black like Darth Vader caps, they on stare

While we rockin' it, I'll rock in it (rock in it)
Like the little ball inside the spray can
Providing three coats for both child, woman and man

God bless the God, lay these Streets Wall to Wall
It go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, you got popped like a flick by that rivalry click
It went, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

It ain't my fault your ass is on the asphalt
Got your chin touched by my fam' who though you brought harm, you see
I'm iced out like a glass of tea
Better yet, oatmeal cookies, y'all just rookies to me
Slidin' up and down the court, but I don't think you can D
Why try? Maseo be gettin' high since Luke was Luke Skywalk'
Man, my topic of talk is sheddin' shame all over your game
Like them shorties who claim that afrocentric lovin' is the past drug
A life filled with that's what thugs love
Snatch you fast, wrap that ass in the rug of your choice
while it muffles your voice

Now when I'm swimmin' through the joint, I put the funk on hold
Cause if you don't, you'll see the bubbles come up
We run up a tab and gladly add a little extra for miss
Flashy faces with bigger lips for that ass to kiss

Most crews are post-current while we're forever
Direct beats that's contagious, loved by all ages
Graduated from the you-and-I-versity
of hard-hitters, for real

I got niggas in the streets that'll blast your ass for the shine
And get, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, if you a fat chick gettin' your fuck on tonight
Then go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, put your hands opposite to the ground if you're lovin' our sound
Go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, and to my broke niggas on the corner holdin' me down
Go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

Yo, I swear Tommy gonna get it, he done did me wrong
I had plans to buy more land, plant corn
Bust kernels on heat, work hard like wetbacks
Set backs is gonna get my ass to be hostile
Rockwilder the beat, top dollar defeat
Big money's make the big decisions
Keep hip-hop alive, it's just an intermission 
Back to the second half of the feature flick
Dick stacks and fuck rap

I had a name for makin' paper since paper mache
Now my dollar coins join pounds of yen for play
While you broke niggas reach drunk much quicker
You don't make enough bread to soak up all your liquor
Went from God to God damn

Damn God, you're killin' it
Should incorporate it, invest half a mil' in it
Rap cats talk with no will in it

Soundin' like they virtual
This joint'll hurt you, yo

Twas the night before Christmas and my crib got robbed
(shh shh shh, shh) They did a job
Took all my goodies out from under the tree, except the CD's
of shiny-suit rappers and flossin' emcees
who fail at takin' it to rhyme degrees

Man, you know no wack poems get no play in our homes
You need to not get nappy with me
Or else we gon' ""relax your mind, let your conscious be free""

Yo, where my Wall Street niggas, if ya up in the stands
Go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
To my women that'll throw they hands against they punk-ass man
Go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, if you never been shot or stabbed
Brick City go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, I gotta catch a cab back to the lab so I can smoke
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!",Oooh,
Redman,"Yes sir! You're gonna do it like this
I am an animal defjammable titanical high flammable
Don't ? me I live ?

My anathema I prescribed it
Said you all in my hood like it
I advise them sterilize them
This ear wasn't clear to hear the album

I know what you people gonna do without him
And these ladies gonna ? around and talk about him
So I keep in money and keep in rocking

Flammable titanical

Call me pimp nuts
On a chick but
She gotta a sister?
I got a mixer
My car inside is dark
The door is suicide ? cut
I am a wringer
You can see me
If I was Avatar in 3D
Hit the TOPCZ
You career like George ?
You can hi hi
But I'm a ha ha
Next to Lady Gaga
In an I-pod
Near kept in a ?
I'm a fly guy? Well I'm not?
I'm like tata I rock music
I try to bisect for life like a Jewish kid
And me running in the block like a new kid


That's like hu!
Not in a ? print

I know what you people gonna do without him
And these ladies gonna ? around and talk about him
So I keep in money and keep in rocking

Flammable titanical

I was an asshole in the class role
Now I'm a sick nigger like a bad cold
Mister unforgettable Nat Cole
You can't witness none of it from the back role
Nigger move up and walk with my foot
And follow my ingredients like a cook book
Let me show you how to hustle ?
I even have something to oil you like a ? cook
Me short look? That is not me
I feel cookie like Rocky part three
When I speak white girls jack me
They know I rush limbo ?
Part me ? you'll find out
That I'm a lady's men
Rihanna felt
? I'll blow your mind out
With dynamite ?

I know what you people gonna do without him
And these ladies gonna ? around and talk about him
So I keep in money and keep in rocking

Bounce back, open your mind Y'all
Grind your whole ass till you twist your waistline

So genuine, every time, Busta redefine
The wicked knew the dime
Making Y'all press rewind

The bounce rock skates make you cross the foul line
Shine a nickel nine

Stick the worst of porcupine

Shit blazing so hot DJ's scratch the test presses
Like make it mo hot baby

Turn it up, I want to hear it real loud, just
Turn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby
Turn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just

Yo, come on baby just feel my heat wave
A lot of hot ones ready for niggas that act brave
Chill son, you better off if you behave
Flip money while broke niggas trying to save
Lay low, I say so, my pesos
Import my cheese stack by the castros
Make clothes 
Or stay fly a chase hoes
Equatorians soft lips and straight nose
Making dough
When we ripping the paid show
Get the money and dip, we in the Range Rove
Now we making grands
We name brand
We make plans, change plans
Then we expand across land
Do it properly
Yo, I said open sesame
The recipe,  be the hot shit, it's got to be
Yo, landscape 
We arrange a whole shape
Rock the fly tape
Then I continue to skyscrape

[Featuring Redman] 
Chorus: Parrish Smith (from 'So What Cha Sayin') 
Brothers on my jock for the way I hold a piece of steel (4x) 
So what cha saying 
Verse One: Redman 
I go wild as I sip from a cold Lowenbrau 
Set up rhymes like fire to gunpowder 
Boom  did the bassline crank 
From being rated are  from being top rank 
I'm hard like an erection 
Phrases might get too tough to break down in sections 
So I grab a pen and pad, I'm back 
to make a killer, similar to a backstab 
Don't arrest me, arrest my brain, it's insane 
If I'm booty, then I've been framed 
By an MC, who can't be the are-E-D 
Fuck wit me, you'll get slapped up and capped up easy 
By me and a tre-eight pistol, so vacate the premises 
Or ask for Mayday, Mayday 
For H-E-L-P, brothers tell me 
I'm electrifyin, similar to round three 
I don't brag and boast but smash and roast 
MC's wit degrees from here to the West Coast 
I'm miracle wit no abrakadaba 
Piece of membranes will smash like crackers 
Were they Ritz, Saltine, or Town House 
None of the above get caught wit the roundhouse 
Kick, blackflip, semifull 
My vocal chord prove my pull ain't bull 
I'm down wit the Squad, no more than four to five brothers 
Six or more, you seen got smothered 
By a fist of fury, next is the verdict 
Let's hear it from the jury 
Chorus 
Verse Two: PMD 
I'm a nightmare to rappers, terror to an MC 
Cold wreck the nigga wit the help of E-D 
Aggravation, don't need it, so get off my dick 
Master of disaster, no time for flicks 
Straight up be	-boy, Real McCoy like Bruce Leroy 
Strap the bozack when I'm stabbin a skeezoid 
Gangsta rap, it's Daddy Mack wit a bozack 
Roy the funk punk pumps skunk like a smokestack 
So swing low and lick up balls 
I'm like Scharzenegger, correcting shit in Total Re- 
call up E-D and the posse that's ten deep 
To wax a sucker nigga booty rappin MC 
So step off cause you gets no props 
So stick the fork in him, Redman (why) cause he's done 
Chorus 
Verse Three: Erick Sermon 
I'm E-D, I belong wit the A-Team 
A one man wreckin machine, by all means 
Necessary, I destroyed on contact 
No fear, of getting killed cause I'm strapped 
The Hit Squad's deep, making it sweet 
to creep, on my crew so you don't sleep 
My mic is caffeine, similar to Maxwell 
Making it smooth for me, yes, to wax well 
And you might get scared and spark a stove 
Cause I pack steel but Hold On like En Vogue 
My swiftness, I got a gift not for Christmas 
God bless, mmm-hmm, can I get a witness 
I'm fresh like a bag of Chips Ahoy 
No toy, I'm a hardcore be	-boy 
Once again, I quote, I'm danger 
I smoked Smokey the Bear and killed the forest ranger 
Poof, the fire's out and I'm gone 
Peace to Mandela and Farrakhan

",Brothers on My Jock,1990
Redman,"Look! Up in the sky! 
It's a bird... 
It's a plane!
Hee hee hee hee, naw! It's Sooperman Lover, baby! 

Daddy, Daddy! 
Would you please read us a story? 
Alright, get over here and sit yo big ass down  
Lemme tell you about the Sooperman Lover... 

A yo, I was out to lunch and shit 
Puffin' on a blunt to get my head ready
Boogie'n to my Walkman 
With an ""S"" on my chest 
(Bust a move!) 
Yes I'm a super hero, don't forget 
I smoke mad niggas 
So to hell with cigarettes 
But anyway, 
Let's get back to this skit 
You know who the fuck I am 
So git off that ol' bull-shucks 
Lunchtime was up, (Fuck!!) 
Let me jet, or I'll collect unemployment bucks 
On the way back, black, 
I spotted this object, a stray cat 
Stuck in a tree 
With a tag that says that: 
""If found, 
Please return to this address"" 
(How did you see it)? 
Nigga! With my X-Ray eye set! 
Like ""Pchooooww!"" 
I jetted to the closest phone booth 
Quick fast, 
I dipped into my Sooperlover suit... 

(I can leap, 
Tall buildings 
In a single bound...) 

Boom!! 
Right through the fuckin' phone-booth ceiling! 
(It's a plane!) 
Naw, Sooperman Lover's the name 
I can slam King Kong 
And pick up freight trains 
On a mission, 
To save this cat that was wishin' 
He was in his litter 
Watchin' Fritz on channel 6
Relaxin' 
Feet cocked-up just a little 
With a cold cocktail 
And a bowl, of tender vittles 
I snatched, him 
Took off through the air like a pigeon 
Quick so he won't start 
Meowin' and bitchin' 
The letter in cat's tag address
Said the projects 
(Elevator's broke!) 
So I had to take the back steps 
(Knock, Knock) 
The door opened 
Then my eyes swole 
From this bad ass dame (Damn!) 
Sippin' a quart of ""Old Gold"" 
""Yo, is this your cat?"" 
""Awww, yes! Where'd you find him at?"" 
""He was stuck in a tree, 
Around Uptown Manhattan"" 
""Well how the hell did you save him? 
Are you Police Undercover?"" 
""Naw baby, 
The ""S"" on my chest stands for:"" 

[Chorus:] 
Sooperman Lover (Yeah!) 
Baby call him the Sooperman Lover 
Something wrong... 
Something wrong, indeed 
Something wrong. Yes, yes indeed... 

She was grateful 
Lookin' for ways to repay me 
No money, 
A donut, and some...um coffee maybe? 
Of course 
What kind of sauce did I take? 
Make my donut jelly 
And my coffee Sanka 
We sat, 
Unhooked the cape from the back 
She felt my arms 
'Cause my pythons looked stacked 
""Goddamn, Sooperlover! 
Your shit looks thick 
Tell me, how strong are you 
With muscles like this? (You bad motherfucker!)"" 

(I'm stronger than a locomotive) 

I'll keep hittin ya like Rocky 
She ran to the room 
And came back with a 
Negligee, high-heeled shoes, 
Wit' a blunt in her mouth 
Ready to roll up, 
Hey hold up, she had the dollar folded up 
To mix the coke with the smoke 
Yo, she was no joke 
She took a sniff, 
Some got on her top lip 
That bitch stuck out her tongue 
And gave her top lip a lick 
And said ""Here baby, hit it."" 
""Naw baby, I ain't wit' it 
You'd need more than a body 
To make me want to hit that shit!"" 
But I'll hit the blunt 
So she took out her fronts 
Cracked the Philly 
Opened the bag and laid out the skunk 
Then I took a long pull 
It was hype outta sight 
We ran into the bedroom 
So I cracked my pants for head room 
Later, tossed the covers 
And oh, brother! I was wit' it 
Ready to hit it 
Asked my dick, ""Yo, wassup G?"" 
""Yo man, shit's thick"" 
Licked her down her belly 
And kissed her on her back 
Stuck my hands between the legs 
And I felt the ball sack 
As big as mine (Yo!) 
This bitch must be craze, 
So I threw my suit on 
And I was Swayze... 
'Cause I'm the:

Redman,"Make my funk, the P-Funk
I wants to get funked up

Make my funk the P funk, we thump
Lyrics that bounce the brain, make emcees jump
Sky high
Can't touch the level so why try?
Fall Guy compare me status to fly guy
Rough and rugged, and brother it takes ten to conquer
That's why I'm on probation
Ever since three, I cut throats of emcees
Mediocre lyricist who burnt with degrees
Of two-ten
Not from an oven, but MAC-10
A MAC-20 maybe if I didn't subtract ten
My background straight from a black mans culture
Want more, buy the video or Redman sculpture
For your mantle, damn you
Too hard to handle
E-Double slam once, and Redman slam two
Break hooks, earthquake shook the state of NJ
Okay, bust the big gate
For microphones that have swollen mic cords
PE fights for power
Redman fights for soul power
Funk is strong as a tree trunk
Ask me the flavor
Make mines the P funk

Make my funk, the P-Funk
I wants to get funked up
Make my funk, the P-Funk
I wants to get funked up",Da Funk,1992
Redman,"I got it goin on, since I'm up next to flex
You could bet I drop heavy so girls grab your Kotex
I catch fits when I blitz a rhyme grit
And my lip gets to the point, to rip some mo' fly shit
Redman ready to rock rough rhymes
Renegade rapper, rip when it's rhyme time
Punk push a pen and pencil when I'm pissed
Pack Pistol Posse, flow some more pro shit
Fee-Fi-Foe-Fum, funky to floor, ay
Fuck ya freak words for foreplay
Quickly, quiet is kept, never quack
On the Q-Tip I quote, I throw lines like a quarterback
A monster, murder motherfucks like Manson
A madman, who mutilize men with 9-M-M
Bullets blow bad, brother back to back I slam
Bread and butter, break beats to Bam Bam
Jump off the jim before I jack my Johnson
I jam like Janet, chew MC's like Swansons
Dennis stamp dummy, I'm diggin a dungeon
Can you dig that I dig deep, to destroy dumb-dumbs?
Yes, I yam what I yam when I jam, bro
My afro's in the house (yo yo yo)
Long as I live large, life will be luxury
Ladies in Lamborghinis, love is like luck to me
Nasty nigga, competition is none
From Newark, New Jersey, knock heads like Mike Nunn
Shit, grab the steel when I'm strokin'
Smoke with shotguns but the sign said no smokin'
Cool it kiddo, I control from sea to sea
Cut like Chuckie, plus style is cock-D
Superman Lover, cool from the new school
Hold your breath, while I walk holdin' my jewels

Hardcore to make the brothers act fools",Hardcore,1992
Redman,"I get mad wicked (fuck around) and catch a bad one by the funker
I puff the mad spliffs and roll blunts with Archie Bunker
'Cause my brain is twisted, so I cock the biscuit
'Cause shit's thick, some say I'mma bastard of a swift bitch
Negro, funkin' it with the style in your ear, bro
To make you fear me like Cape without Robert DeNiro
You big pussy, so funky that you have to douche me
You can't hear me then my record label didn't push me
I know I'm sayin' 'funk' too many times in my rhymes
But if I wasn't that, I wouldn't freak it in the line
But it don't seems to matter 'cause my shit get fatter and fatter
I'll do the funk in your face and it slaps ya
How does it feel with the face full of funk
With the bass in your trunk, weed laced with the blunt
I puff, I never got snuffed, bust while I dust your monkey
Ass off then I just crush on the hush hush
So if you want a taste of the funk from the gutter
Ask the brothers (Why?) 'Cause I'm bad (Word to mother)

I'm a bad, Yo, word to the mother 
I'm a bad, Bad bad, and a wicked in bed

Yo kid chill, a'ight, a'ight, check it out

Flexy I'm sexy when I'm standin' in my drawers
If you can't check me when I'm rappin', put the tape on pause
And listen to the incredible shit that I kick my man
Give me five on the backhand then stick
Your finger in a hole and chop the stick quick
'Cause my lip get to the point, to STILL rock the fly shit
Since you're holding your breath, I hold my jewels
I swing hardcore, so I walk, holdin' my tools
The original P-Funk, takes no junk, from a chump, or punk, G
I been this way every since nine months
So get down while I rip the raps from my lip 'cause
My shit's more deep, than any tape from Enigma
The gettin' nice, thinkin' killer brother who pop trash
Basic instinct — I'm a shooter so they got blasted
Much ass I kick, groove to the master mix
My song still pumps when it's not even mastered, bitch!
My shit's very chronic so rewind it
'Cause it's like.. eh-eh-eh-eh beyond, bionic!
'Cause I'm a wild and crazy guy! No lie!
Last brother to battle me I started pissin' in his eye
I'm bad, word to mother, to the motherfuckin' Hubbard
Eatin' her curds and whey, puffin spliffs 'cause she doesn't
And if you still don't under-fuckin-stand where I'm comin' from
Listen to my nine, understand where it's hummin' from!

Redman,"""Get down, get down, on down.."" like James Brown plus I get down
But for now I ""Get on up!"" rhythm and funk
Makes you hump like Technotronic I'll make the Jam Pump
Strong to the finish when I freak the fly gimmick like
""Du-na-da-du-duh!"" without eating my damn spinach
Cause when I'm on a roll, that's when Redman start
""To chill,"" round off backflip cartwheel
""Ah, you guessed it!"" I know
When my afro grow that mean more rhymes to flow
But I continue, on the menu, and send you
On a jam that earthquakes the whole damn venue
It's like this, it's like that, I won't slack
I pack more steel than the cops pack blackjacks
Word is bond, the quiet storm broke your arm
When I sound off from here all the way to Hong Kong
Drop pound for pound to throwdown and strut
Yo E what's that funk mode? ""Get on up!""

""I just want to jam for you""
""Ev-everybody get up!""
""I just want to jam for you""
""Get on up!""

Check this out here, let the rough cut cut your ear
Hit Squad's the crew I'm twenty-two and Beck's the beer
Float like Muhammad, roll-on like Secret
Me rip, the crowd in half on the sneak tip
Til they crumble, too humble for you to stumble
I sting like a bu-bee while the others bum-bumble
Don-dan-dan, do-do-dan-ding
Extremely wild, like the hair on Don King
Cause I kick the mode to make your brain explode
It's the HUH, the funk, now I'm known around the globe
So buckle up, hush up, while I freak the funk to get down
With the sound, grab my bozack then I freeze now
On your mark, get ready, get set, let's go
With the flow to jet like Delta, or Jesse O
Whiz with the bends I clean my front lens
With a system, that knocks harder than Rin-Tin-Tin
Without question, I'm flexy when I'm sexin
Wicked when I Kick It like A Tribe Called Quest-in
The rude Redman rip backbones and hips to bits
Then split ya from your wrist to your armpits
But true indeed, since pop's dropped the seed
I knew I'd be, the funkiest brother that ever bleeds
Rough and rugged, more nuggets in the bucket
That's dum dum dollars, and yes Redman love it
Pound for pound, I throw down to make ya strut
Yo E what's that funk mode? ""Get on up!""

Redman,"How you doing, Redman, I'm Dr. Trevis
Okay, my papers show that you strangled a white male by the name of a Mr. Van-Allen
At a rap concert, matter o' fact, Redman
My papers show that you committed the same criminal acts in 12 other states
Okay, what we're gonna do here today, Redman
If you wanna bring some of that unnecessary anger out your system
But I can't do it alone so what I need you to do is co-operate, okay?
Nod your head up and down for yes, and side to side for no
Right, okay, erm.. Redman, I hear that you're a rapper
If you had your chance to create your own album
In your own words, tell me
In your own words, how would you build it
How would you make it work?
Focus your mind, focus your mind",Psycho Ward,1992
Redman,"Nah nah nah, fuck that!
Don't hold me back, the Funkadelic Devil just snapped
With a rap, that's shittin on the story of Jack Sprat
So put your money where your mouth is, watch Redman house shit
And if it's beef I'll punch you in your mouth kid ('Damn!')
I got a heart but my heart is made out of nails
Word to ?Jamel?, my heart pumps nails in my blood rails
I'm not a warrior or barbarian type of nigga
I'm just quick to smoke your family then fuck your sister
That's what type of shit I'm on, word is bond
Been thinkin about playin that nice guy role
Cause every since I was an infrant I was different
Paid no attention to my moms when she ripped it
I was a hardheaded mother-eff, but had to step
Cause she hit me with a left, then another left
That's why my brain is out of order
Because it takes just a quarter to manslaughter your little daughter
And do a driveby, fuck that, I walk by and I spray shit
Then carve my name in your pavement
I was Rated 'X' but I flexed
I beat up the devil with a shovel so he dropped me a level
Ain't that ill? That I could just stand and watch a bloodspill
From a known rapper, but now the rapper's no frill
Just because I made a record I'm a star, that's bullshit
What's the flavor ?Tim? (Fuck what you heard, this rated R)

Back to part two of the segment, the Red bend
Mics of all types, pour beer out for my dead friends
And if I didn't know ya, to hell witcha punk
And tell the devil I'll be in town for lunch (heh heh heh heh)
Got Naughty in my Nature plus I'm down with O.P.P
The best part about it, I got AIDS, bitch!
Psych, I'm only kiddin, only do it to ugly women
Cause the pretty one's puss smell like they went fishin
I grab my dick with a tight grip, cause I might flip
(Yo Red, kick that hype shit on who you had a fight with!)
I had a fight with Chuck, the punk motherfuck
Tried to stab me in the gut, so I dazed him with a uppercut (BING!)
Snapped the neck on Michael Myers then I freaked it; cause it was August
And he was talkin this trick or treat shit (Trick or treat!)
Jason my man slangs rocks like up the block
143rd and Amsterdam by the smoke shop
Norman Bates work the night shift late
Since he dresses like his momma, I pimp him and his hoecake
Bust a maneuver Freddy Kruger, dreamed about
Me havin' him scooped up, he woke up with his dukes up
That caused me to cut the hands off the man with the chainsaw
Plus I got his brain pickled in a jar
So let's get down with the funk break, cause they tailgate
My rap style, so to cut em off I truncate
And rough em up, tough em up, like bust em up
With the one-two punch, like servin a customer
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I know, from me, THE original P-Funk

On the strength!
Party with Machine and Oprah Winfr'
First class tickets, hotel bitches puffin mad blunts
Blunts?
Blunts
Blunts don't don't rhyme with Oprah Winfr' troop
Who cares what rhymes with it long as the funk pump through my Benz truck
Now you know you don't own a Benz
Yes I do and chrome's the trim
Black with a system when it's hittin I'm pullin mad skins
With Olde E sittin in between my lap
And when brothers act up, a gun machine I pack
The original P-Funk, got the jewels trunk, a funker
When I'm sexin, my bad is bigger than any buster's
Like Max and
Wait wait wait, could we get on with the tape?
Lights, camera, hah, action
Welcome to Red's tape, may I take your order?
It's a slaughter if you order the hit without the water
And then swallow without the damn water to follow
You might be doin the stupid dance and win a grand at the Apollo
Whatchu know?
I'm rough, snap necks, drink Olde E, but crack Beck's
Wreck anything that's wet, when I have sex
For instance, I mix with, a style that make you shit bricks
Tsk tsk, I'm musically gifted, to rip it
Um-shat-lot, Red got crazy knots
And knots in the pots, got props from here to George Washington Bridge
I get biz, I use hats, so no kids
Fuck, I took out more suckers, than a
Hold up! I don't think I can freak the funk like that
I might have to nap, because my afro is like Shaft
Puffy, fade it quite lovely and to snuff me
Get your gang, cause I'm Fightin with more Power than Chuck D
Chuck D from Public Enemy?
Yeah he's a friend of me
The one that say ""Brothers and sisters?""
Yeah but he's no kin to me
I'm strictly negro, I freak the style and there it goes
Boom!
If a stitch in time saves nine, then I got shit sewed
Put pins in needles, and needles in pins
A happy man is a happy man, that, when I'm hittin skins
Fuck skins, I'm hittin puss when it's gush
Then eat it when the puss is well cooked
Look!
Up in the air?
No the cab
Who's in the cab? Whut Thee?
It's Superman! Why?

Funky fresh in the flesh, the superman grand slams a new twist
Scoop this, Redman is milk like two tits
I stay, freshly dipped with the nine
And a clip on my hip, money grip, no bullshit
I tic-tac on small cracks I'm all that to fall black
My jaw snap with raps so umm, get the balls jack
Flavor like flav, plus I'm well paid
Own a maid with a plaid, mack daddy of the decade
At a slow rate, I sparkly like Colgate
My dick's name machete, I stab much ho-cake
I don't have a car, but own a pair of Reeboks
It gets me where I'm going, until my damn feet stops
On and on like a switch, bust the mix

To make me boom to zoom with the tune
To make the cow jump back over the moon
It's Reggie Noble, Yeah, I'm feelin' kinda so-so
I dog you like toto, make Rudolph nose glow
Funk out of site with the type of hype
To make you say umm, a dy-no-mite!

My rap style is swift like boom bips 
So come get a whip, and a bump, it's rough 
Crews couldn't hold it in handcuffs 
The ordeal is that I'm raw ill on the mic 
Switchin my styles up like a transvestite (word) 
I think of competition as (?) and 
Keith Murray is the vocabulary champ 
Come in against deep notable to breach lines
I'll make you make the same mistake twice three or four times 
And nobody got a style like this 
You could say, I got my thinking cap on backwards 
I'll demolish the retarded smartest rap artists 
Regardless, tryin to scream the hardest 
I fuck your head up like amphetamines with L.O.D. 
Then bend you out of shape like a master Yogi 
I put my head through your chest, just to see 
Who's next in line, just to get wrecked 
I makes contact, bust the interlude 
I take my skills to another level like Qualudes 
And you couldn't hear me out; cause the type of shit 
I converse about'll drag your brain in the slaughterhouse

The active half flippin shit so split 'fore I explode - BOOM! 
So umm, pay attention, before I put you and your crew on suspension 
For being closed minded to my invention 
Yo, I rock on reel when I record oh my lord 
The world full of jackers so I keep my shit stored

Aw my goodness! Could this be 
The funk that I was stretching out my lungs 
Funkadelic sums up I clear the mucus 
Stick tissue up my nose to stop the snot from makin spots 
To be or not I still give niggaz polka dots for plots 
Now Richard Dawson had a survey sayin that I was awesome 
Throw on your Walkmans while I pour the funk sauce in your coffins 
WAKE UP! While the blunt's laced up just to pick the pace up 
My style's freaky, nasty like Seka pussy papers 
When I raped her, you don't know check the four-uno-uno you know 
That funk mixture that gets your body, holy like scriptures 
Now right about now I'm settin off a bomb to blow the Empire to ashes 
'Cause my shit's more raw than niggaz stashes 
Massive funk, swingin bangin bent up while I fucked ya

Redman,"[Tame One]
Artifacts, check around my fuckin BLOCK, I X-Men like Cyclops
When I lift my shades up, my eyes blaze Ghetto Red Hot
But as is, my ad-libs, are more wicked than bad kids
Ask Biz if Tame leaves marks like a shit skid

[El Da Sensai]
It's the Mister, on a mission mixer of the rougher
Mix the snuff that get you up ? but no style is tougher
I dismiss crews, I bruise, snooze ya losin
Groovin provin I can do in men who went out smoother
Artifact chart, my rap gat starts to battle
Tracks be fat so who dat?  Nigga I be through black

[Tame One]
I get biz on bitches, puff izz with my cousins
Tame shit so wild, honies roll they eyes like Teddy Ruxpin
I hit mad skins, then roll up bills on the reals
My skills mad ill, but chill kid, everything's real
from naps up top, down to the wrinkles in my Reeboks
I'm up late like Leno playin demos from my toolbox
My crew rocks, two blocks away from the buddha spot
I'm out but don't get it fucked up, cause I wsnt you to rock

[El Da Sensai]
I come from the slums of New Jeruz I do bums
who can't adapt no haps son, you know I close on caption
You know this, boss niggaz like Lex to Mr. Otis
You can't hold this BITCH I'm swift like a lotus

..

[Tame One]
Well it's the wiseguy, who never did a driveby
but I fly zones, and shine like chrome, on 7:35
I, play my Hi-Fi, volume up sky high
Talkin buddha thai, don't bother tryin to fascinate my eye
I got 20/20 like Baba Wawa on a Friday
Buy my tape, so I can put a Cruiser in my driveway
Say hi Tame, pass the dutch so I can take a puff
of Born Cypher Cypher Master, I never get enough
No curls, no braids, peasy heads still get paid
Smokin sassy-frassy, that grows free, in the Everglades
and get lit, trip up on the phone and talk some sex shit
But that's some next shit, yo peace I'm out to the exit

[El Da Sensai]
It's the funky Mister Ripper split your ass
Quick-fast, you never outlast the outcast
I'm stompin weak-ass niggaz, so ready let's go
I gas up a skit, I got the snaps on the petrol
I'm never fake I break the funk breaks I'm breakin
MC El create the styles that brothers ain't makin
To go past the end I run you over like a semi
Remember I be the guy, who's fuckin up your shit I,
be the one to call myself def in any program
Scan my battleplan before I step into a jam
I cross the major diction when fixed I'm a rap magician
You keep fishin for rhythms while I'm puffin on the ism
A Ford Explore, the rap tour, comin through ya door

But before you do move my glock before it shoot my cock 



And see basically them trick bitches get no dap (word) 

And see basically Redman album is no joke (word) 

And see basically I don't get caught up at my label (word) 

Cause I kill when they fuck with food on my dinner table (word) 



I drop a punchline at lunchtime 

cause I'm a Close Encounter of the None Kind

And to the nosey snake-ass hoes I ask you 

Why you be acting all fly 

when your monkey-ass work at fast food? 

And why is it everytime that a multiplatinum artist 

always use the underground to make a comeback? 

Is it fair to the hardcore niggaz that rap? 

That don't give a fuck about the radio 

plus the next bitch at that? 

And being hardcore and mad about wearing high-tech boots 

and black skelly hats? 

And making fake-ass frowns because your best buddy packs?

Can I get a hit? Thank you 
What you're about to experience is a walk on the Funkadelic side
Who knows better than the Funkadelic devil himself

Come walk with Def Squad on the darkside
Coming to you live and direct without further adieu
I bring to you Redman one more time
This is Jeff Stewart and you know how I do it god damn!

So who's that funky nigga that's known to kick the fat shit?
The mirror said ""You are, you conceited bastard""
Done by the dogcatcher, dogcatcher, it's the dogfetcher, I betcha
Ah, with the slang
Get you coughed up from the weed it'll bust your brain
The top notch of hip-hop and I'm on the charts
I'm catchin' applause when I rock the micraphone from the heart
My style's foul, so look into the eyes of Lorimars
As you can see, I drop funk bars from here to Mars
Still rollin' down the highway wit' my forty between my lap bitch
Crossin' DTW, coming into my lap and
Boy my skills are stacks, I love to do it from the back
My style swarms over ghettos like crack
Blow in any hood and puff a blunt with any nigga
As long as we both got, it don't matter who's gun bigger
But I bet you you can't do that, 'cause the multi-platinums
Can't save your ass on the block, and you're fucked if it ain't pop
The funk is blowin' wattage out your fuckin' trunks
Like peak Puma, I known to give a whole lots of lumps
Props I got, coming through your block nine cocked
My socks, even got three-eighty-nine shots
Don't press it, I hang 'em like them niggas do in Texas
You don't have no heart you chestless, 'cause your heart's on my necklace
I give props to real MC's like KRS-One
Kool G Rap, Buckshot, Busta me and I'm from
The East coast! Where a nigga like you get that fat?
And since you came out gassed, well I'm closin your gas cap
The creature, from the deeper, ultimate funk freaker
Represent New Jersey, keep your eyes up on the bleacher
A menace like Dennis, I got game like Ennis
I can french-kiss my lyrics, then I run trains with sentence
Lord have mercy! It's too much funk to cope with

My flows be's wet like all you girls drawers be 
Crack the dill's spread the Buddha in the hid-ouse 
Roll it up and Diddas, who tipped in for the 10 bag 
Etcetera, I roll my blunts with two textures 
Pick up 50 bags and then I smoke all the extras 
It's the truth like funk 180 proof 
Don't drop your drawers I'll fuck through your daisy dukes, true 
Put your fingers up in the air if your high 
I walk by, so f-in' dry 
I swing up in it 'bout an average as half as 
Good as Reggie Jackson's that's why you talk backwards 
And touch bills and Bogart shit like Humphrey 
You couldn't beat me if you ran with 21 Jumpstreet 
Or 90210 fuck it yo, in the movies
I'm the Nigga puffin' Buddha in the back row

I can't wait to get it on [Repeat 8x]

I rock round the Cliddock 
My Gliddock cocked from here to 16 for Liddocks 
I tried to Thomas if I'm gettin' scopic 
I was built like two tits but now I'm butter like Blue Bonnet 
Now who got the funk, we got the funk 
A yo well, I got the weed, we got the blunt 
I never sniff, I used to puff Buddha's in the jail 
Back in 88 when it was 20 cent a gram 
You couldn't read me in braille, hell 
I write my names on walls in smoke spots when I'm buyin' L 
The fly guy with force like Luke sky 
Down for 8 ball see twa bitch if you fly 
The funkadelic been rockin' mic's since the fourth grade 
I terminate like X and I terminate like Schwarzenegge' 
Dum di dum, rock like Buju Banton 
Soup like won ton, fuck by the ton 
Please, my whole crew's makin' cheese 
Tonight's the night baby so suck up on these 
And it's on

I said, I catch the A-train to the left, smoke the junk 
I set shit off like Boba Fett. 
Big up to all my Nigga's in the housing projects 
I'm Runnin' up in your contingents and split your guts, round and round 
If you get scared of my lines when I rock well 
Got wits like Pernell, shits the bomb like Akinyele
Rickety rock it, mind be best to knock this 
Waste Nigga's like toxic, wet like galoshes 
Can I handle my biz? Yes you can 
I 'cause chaos and bring a lot of def to jams 
Yes I can, now ask to get out 
Pop the trunk, clu-clunk and now give me a ba-bump ba-bump 
Oh, cool, smooth like two blue suede shoes 
Y'all faggot's stepped on my Huffman and Coo's 
Word to Dan, tan, pillow and cool be	 
Switchin' speeds like Bruce Lee ridin' a Fuji in a movie 
I drop on the one, fuck the two three 
Funky like a box of Coochies on looseleaf 

Yo yo I said 
Switchin' up speeds, like Bruce Lee 
Ridin a Fuji, in a movie 
I've been sayin' some shit

Redman, Keith Murray, Erick Sermon with the, cosmic slop
And we all pack glocks

As I flip, skip to the beat, on wax, and tax
I react with tons of macs, a ball, and some jumping jacks
Flyin expert, puttin in work
No question, cosmic funk and weed session
Like Gangstarr, step up, it's hard to earn
But I change up the mode, and blow up the globe

My cosmic slop rules all blocks with funk maneuvers
My flow freeze the Nile, the funk child splits the river
Then I crush, like the bom-ba-zee was rushed, through my verbal lust
I'm spaced out, I lost my mind on cloud nineteen
Visine for eyes, when I blow alpines
Dial 9, 0-0, for the hero of the weirdos
I hope my brain don't bust
Transform into a 7-11 Slurpie slush
It's the fly, my music will burn eyes
Twice the chemical of Clorox
Then I do an autopse on four cops
When my jaws drop, ock, I fidget my nuts a lot
Got the two glocks, with oowops then bodies trace the chalk
I'm like an eclipse on a Friday, the 13th
With black cats and Haley's comet, blazin blunts in my driveway
Nostradamus predicted, for you funk fiends
That def squad will get the fuckin cream like noxem...geyeah

        for those that remember pics and afros (it's on like that)
        platform shoes and bell-bottoms some got em
        spaced out, way out, is what I'm talkin about
        in the cosmic slop of the ghetto
Zuzuzuzuzu, zuzuzu, zuzu zuzu zuzu
Zu zuzu, zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu

With amazing manifestations, I dictate to nations
More cosmic funk innovations in my creation
This cosmic sick mic cylcicyst
Mega segments, be sega, like genesis
I orbits the solar system, listenin
Guzzlin, never sippin, or slippin and sympin when the track is rippin
I gotcha brain cells bendin and twistin
Man listen, I give your whole crew a ass drenchin
Just for mentionin, goin that route, runnin yo mouth
You get your head smacked off towards down south
And your crew too will be spaced out
Way out, no doubt, y'all niggaz need to stop
And get with this cosmic slop

to where no other nigga or bitch has ever entered 

Let me lick your funky emotions with my cosmic lyrics 

From a place we call hell, and beyond...",Dr. Trevis,1994
Redman,"Yo
I can hear myself

On the behalf of the knotty headed nigga 
And the Def Squad force 
We'd like to thank you for purchasin' the new Redman tape 
And hope you show the same love for us next go 'round",Dr. Trevis (Signs Off),1994
Redman,"Motherfuckin  ladies and gentleman 
My style's rugged like Timberland 
When I clock lyric then women give me more love than Wimbledon 
My style flow local like New Jersey transit 
And I can't stand it 
And you'll need Teddy to unjam it when I cram it 
I'm from N to the E 
W A R K  Newark NJ got the AK 
When I wave bitch you better say heeyyyyyyyy 
I'm a Kid From the Hall 
I got big balls to make your pussy walls dribble in my drawers 
Hey boy this is the way the East coast swing it so bring it 
Man I told you ass Brown-er than James with the Sex Machine shit 
I keep the chronic patrol on the road 
In case you're wondering why I keep my izm 
Cause I smoked everybody else's shit up 
My style's the ultimate funk when I mic checka 
One two checka 
And I give effects to niggaz with my Black and Decker 
So check the, manuscript, man you flipped 
Put it down if you can't handle it 
Got a B-R-C-G, Blunt Rollers College Graduate 
I got a degrees in Physics on how high I can get 
Then next I check how many niggaz that can die from my Tec 
Cause the N-E-W-A-R-K is where the niggaz robbin and stealin 
And fuckin niggaz everyday 
Now Jersey's on max so pass the dutchie on the lefthand side 
Hide the hidash, in case we cridash, in my ride 
So, sliiiide, before I call the medics 
You can bet bitch you couldn't get fly if you were FedEx 
Can I, drop the funk on ya, run it on ya 
Strong as ammonia, smell it from here to California 
Cause Reggie Noble dropped that cock named Noble at Sunoco 
I'm better than rice and beans when I rock you ocho to ocho 
My music more underground than a kid at 300 XL 
Convertible, fuel-injected, that's why my style's well-respected 
I'm dope on the ridealz, so fidealz, on my didealz 
And chumps are wondering what two niggaz dropped the funk funk 

Verbally you never heard of me I smoke you third degrees 
And cause surgery for emergency 
Cause Reggie Noble's known like burglary 
I get hot busted when I dip my nuggets 
Hey, if it take a million niggaz to stop it just like Chuck did 
Cause we run around Newark with the nine cock 
Keep it heated for the brothers that's not off my block 
And if ya don't know the flavor, be a tough guy and enter 
So go show you more nigga events than Jacob Jaffrey center 
I'm genuine, to the rhyme, get your canines 
Cops that got the hot glock stocked for when it's playtime 
I rock around the Robin TWEET TWEET on the calendar 
Cause you couldn't pull my number if your class major was Algebra 
I make bitches moan to my Stallone without Sylvester 
Cause I'm more deadlier than a whole school system of investors 
So check us, I always smoke mad blunts before breakfast 
Cause I, Get Around like 2Pac with Poetic in my Justic 
Hold tight, hold tight, everybody hold tight 
I'm sooper like my man cat, cause I keep my styles jam packed 
I wrreerawwwowww like Anthrax, split my pants like Bill Bixby 
You could tell the tracks was fat from the work of my MP-60 
I smoke the chronic that's why my sinus always fucked up 
Them bones, them bones, them bones will have you fucked up 
I blaze blunts with my nigga Mellow, yo say hello 
(Yo whattup dogg?) 
Really, now pass the second blunt to Quilly 
Now sit your big ass down 'cause I don't know about this rap stuff 
There wasn't rap when I was pickin cotton, sayin massa 
Y'all y'all whippersnappers, with the caps on backwards 
Man, y'all fuck around with Quilly I kick a bone out yo' ass quick 
Watch out now, I ain't bullshittin 
I representin the oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-G's from forty-three goddamnit 
And if you keep on with that dirty mistreatin 
I'm gonna whoop your ass, til your heart stop beating 

And yo, chronic bubonic the funky bionic 
You find it I'll have to rewind it where minds are blinded 
Time for some action so time to find it 
I smoked out like a cookout, look out my dick's out 
That was last album when I was bouncin on trains like Malcolm 
I was hiiiiigh, I thought I wouldn't survive 
That's why I quit my nine to five and got live 
Because this hip-to-the-hop shit fills my pockets 
And I'm Audi for ninety-four because I already got my props 
Hoes, hoes, and more hoes...",Green Island,1994
Redman,"Switch


Hahahahahahaaaa! 
Come with us 
Come take the elevator shift six billion feet beneath 
Where the Def Squad dwells 
Where your dreams and imaginations is only 
Loose change in a motherfucker's pockets 
This is Dr. trevis coming to you live from WFDS 
We're From the DarkSide radio 
Niggaz  better get your flashlights 
'Cause it's pitchblack! 

I travel the Milky Ways  and the stars of the Gods 
Then return six billion feet beneath to get cigars 
My lyrical format sounds off like gun claps 
Underground, where you need flashlights and hard hats 
My mind is ten levels deeper than Jacob's Ladder 
Batter the paragraph, after your gall bladder will shatter 
Nyphomaniac on track when I Flex like Funkmaster 
Flex you can bet I'm not playing with a full deck! 
I go far beyond acting hard and pullin' triggers 
I just want to die and come back as the Nile on the river 
Zone until I figured, how to wake up in the morning 
And the corners of my mouth be like foamin' when I'm open 
Y'all neighborhood roughnecks, I cause a threat 
My silhouette, who pack smacks niggaz just like Treach 
Comin' through comin' through, put your hands on your handfun 
'Cause I'm crazy off that chronic from my man grandson 
I shoot to kill, puff blunts in Hooterville 
I be murderin' MC's from up here to Urbantown 
I sweat dark, when I get off my shit ock 
Yoyoyo that's that's E and them! 
Yo word up? Yo what's going on? 
Yo chill chill chill chill",Da Journee,1994
Redman,"Woo woo wowowowooo! 
Lord higher 
Could somebody  turn on  da lights 
Somebody  turn on  da lights 
The darkside! Yes

Guess who's back when I bring funk like Zapp 
All aboard motherfuckers! While your brains get jacked 
I'm souped like two scoops of funk juice  word to mother 
The way I kick you swear that Jim Kelly was in this motherfucker 
The darkside brings apartheid 
I act wild like them niggaz from Chi-Town on the Southside 
Sweeter than this, whoopin' niggaz down like Jack Nich 
When I backflip my tactic graphics 
Ooooooh! Redman jams it in 
Due to difficulties I won't be done by ten 
Friend I got bust shots out the twelve Benz 
And then we get the bam-ba-zee from one-ten 
Or is it further up? Plus my style murder ducks 
So what the fuck, you got the mic turned up fo'? 
When I Chief Rock underground MC's drop like sheet rock 
Here's a ride to the underground 

[Chorus: x2] 
To the beat y'all
Ah to the beat y'all, I do the freak y'all 
I keep the Buddha to last me through the week y'all 

Come take a trip on my cosmic movie boogie flicks 
Far beyond space so niggaz say your grace 
It's a True Lie that I bring drama like Schwarzenegger 
When a baby, I had other babies in labor catchin' vapors 
With two gats I move like too fast like Paxton 
Ask Toni Braxton who got seven days of action 
Black stars or moons eclipse the volume 
Bang zoom I'm sendin' honies on the moon with ten bags of boom 
Ridiculously I will pimp an MC 
To degrees I leave spots like chicken pox, check the synopsis 
I grow confusing just like Rubik's cube boxes 
Float like the butter, fly so what if I 
Blow your lenses, tear the fuckin' hinges 
Did I mention that my lyrical format gets more ahs than a dentist 
When I'm in this, the knotty-headed era causes terror 
Y'all gimmick motherfuckers better get y'all shit together 
One for the money and two for my peeps 
Nynex can't even reach my technique or rap sheets 
For the Squad I lick two shots word to God 
Then take y'all dreams and imaginations 
To the darkside",Journey Throo da Darkside,1994
Redman,"Still walkin down the streets with my hand on my black tec 
My brain is high like Newark New Jersey do car thefts 
I'm high  when I sag my 2 Black Guys 
I would be brief but my Karl Kani's didn't dry 
I smoke the blunt for all you underground chumps 
My smoke bangs like it's freshly picked from the swamps 
So nigga how you roll a blunt? Aiyyo  how you roll a blunt 
Flip the script on some other shit like how you roll a cunt 
Now, I smoke the Maui, wow-wee 
Then I'll be back for me, I'm Sure, like Al B. 
Go Uptown, smoke quarter-pounds at the Dungeon 
Keith Murray meets me at the spot with the Bom-Ba 
Go back to Jerz and smoke with Diezel Don 
Huh, pick up a bag from my block, two-oh's the number 
Who can get swift with the microphone mist 
Plus I'm crisp like CD's on LP's in 3D 
My funk respect it, cosmic injected 
That cause me to Set It Off just like that club record 
Hit it from the back, stay strapped like two packs of lubricants 
It's gonna hurt, no it's not a gat experience 
The funk dweller, creeps through your cellar 
And if your moms don't know your ass better tell her, like this y'all 

There's a million and one blunt spots all over the world 
That got good herb for all you boys and girls 
Which one do you go to? *many shouts* 
Which one do you go to? *many shouts* 
I'm packin buddha by the pounds and pull my Phillies from knapsacks 
Hey yo I didn't know your nickel bags come that fat 
Yo check it, my lyrics strip the track butt-naked 
Catch the Local to the A to the buddha to my vocals 
And I, set the world on fire 
Get a billion people higher, from just one blunt in my cypher 
You swore to God you was mixed in bom-ba-zee 
The rhymer Bombs Squads and MC's like Hank Shocklee 
I spend a knot at all the buddha spots 
From fifteen to fifty-fifth I ran all through the blocks 
I set it off jock, I light a blunt for my nigga D 
That's doin three pack, now where I get the hash at 
You can't fuck with my funk cause my funk is kinda abstract 
Past that, I'm rough like McGruff on dust 
There's a million and one blunt spots in America 
Yeah I'm tellin ya 

Now just throw your blunts up in the motherfuckin air 
Smoked out with niggaz from North Newark to Montclair 
I rip the nouns from antonyms to synonyms 
'Cause I got soul like James Brown and rock M&M 
One of the America's Most Blunted 
Smoked out with MC Eiht and Compton Most Wanted 
Ninety degrees, smoke with L.O.D. on the Island 
Then back to Stat, to smoke more packs with the Shaolin 
I showed the women how to roll a blunt stronger 
But it didn't work, because they Lee nails got longer 
But the weed is good for when you're mackin 
And girls can front it off like they don't know shit that happened 
I know what happened, I told her, BACK, NICK that motherfucker 
So check! 
My stamina, your ass couldn't snap with cameras 
Leave you on your back like Godzill did Gamera 
Props on blocks smokin the choc and what-nots 
I might catch a nickel bag sale from bus stops",A Million and 1 Buddah Spots,1994
Redman,"Y'all motherfuckers buckle y'all motherfuckin' seatbelts 
If you need to get high  there's a mask and shit in the overhead compartment 
I can't tell y'all what the weather's like 'cause my radio's fucked up 
And if we should experience any type of motor difficulty 
Don't panic  take one more hit off the oxygen mask 
Calmly put your hands between your legs 
And kiss your black ass goodbye!! 

I'm swift like a motherfuckin' gift for Christmas 
When I send my vapors off like Halls menthalyptus 
My verbs and nouns shatter walls of underground 
Let me be blunt: I like crackin' brews with bitches 
The ninety-four era I cause terror, whatever 
Rainin on you punks with the funk, so get your umbrellas 
My guns cruise, tennis shoes, what's happenin' 
I got clapped on, now I'm the one doin' the clappin' 
I'm Flexi Wit Da Tec like Artifacts make Memorex 
Blow tape decks when I'm more strapped than latex 
Felt like menopause, I make niggaz act like beatches 
Yo yo that nigga Red be frontin with they ass full of stitches 
Woo! I just don't give a fuck 
I bite your whole nipple off, sick like sickle-cell anemia 
Travel around my curse universe 
I'm droppin' 98.7 degrees down to Red Alert 
Droppin' the slang, I'll bust your brains with the real shit 
Come hit my blunt so I can make y'all feel it 
Abuse niggaz verbally so call Dyfus 
I'm a warrior, to the heart, but I didn't kill Cyrus 
Noorotic, my style format rocks the project 
I get as ill as chief of police on narcotic 
Give me a time and I'll free your mind and lick your 
Funky emotions, to blow your veins up with funk overdosing 
Now who's that nigga that got your crew bellin'? 
Not with guns with funk when I rock tracks like Van Halen 

I'm in the world, with Jacob's Ladder 
I'm seein' a lot of happy copycat rappers actin like they got asthma 
They attackin' me, they slowin' they rhymes down actually 
They got factories with little dolls named after me 
But it's no question my funk segment leave the whole atmosphere 
Pressed-in, I take advantage of niggaz like I was molesterin' 
Newark New Jersey's what I represent 

My brain be zoned and I phoned home to ET's home 
And to hook me up with stash spots to put my chrome in 
Whattup to Prince Street, Avon Ave I roll a spliff with 
Fat to be passed through Bedrock and Diamond District 
So what the fuck I got clapped on for my truck 
Then I laughed cause fuck the cash I just wanted my tape bag 
Fantastic fabulous my shit is fat shit 
The bomb like Elway throw bombs on John Madden 
Fuck that, let's get to the point, my shit's the joint, I roast 
Motherfuckers from the East coast to the West coast to your breakfast 
Voltage, I got funk for days by the buckets 
PPP packs a bunch of wild motherfuckers 
Hold hold hold, wait wait wait 
Let me school this bitch 
Yo bitch my shit is tight, can any MC do this 
And come back on the mic? 

I think not, my paper make pen leave nuff ink spots 
On blocks where your punk ass still bustin' off slingshots 
Talkin' shit about me when I'm drivin by slowly 
Sayin' I'm this and that when half y'all punks don't even know me 
Now just for that I let your girl suck my dick from the back 
And let your moms give me cornrows on my crack 
'Cause I'm nasty like that",Noorotic,1994
Redman,"Sat down and opened my mind and said it's time 
For me to design the right lines 
Make you one of a kind boy rough and 
Tough and all that stuff 
Sure enough I'll make the brother's change their minds 
Then you understand my only principle 
No need to fuck with the born invincible 

I'm rated X like a porno feature 
Leaving MC's dazed and catching an anesthesia's 
Even females get rocked when they try to cock 
Block the man from doing this hip hop
Techniques unique and that's my word is bond 
Rockafella's the name but the screaming I'll rock on",Rockafella (R.I.P.),1994
Redman,"Yo  this blunt is for all the niggaz that was in the 
Holding pen with me in central booking 
Welcome to the system

Coming to you live from Newark  New Jersey]

Fucked up [all night] all night

Fucked up [all night] all night

Rock on, rock on, yo here comes that Funkadelic 
I come wetter than Purple Rain, I bust brains, the funk Doctor 
Spock, got the glock, now I'm smoking out your sess spot 
I rock from here to Bedstuy, I hit the spot like XY 
Who is that nigga that's coming six billion feet 
I roll my funk and find tone even smoke up blues with 18th Street 
I cut massively with sneaky styles like Dick Dastardly 
Look at the letter-coated afro like my man Shaft would be 
The new vroom, crisp like chicken and Chinese food 
I'm just like The Whispers here to put you in the mood 
[Jumping Jersey] Yeah you heard me, got more family than the Partridge 
Roll the red carpet for Red from here to corner markey 
You're trying me, I'm a menace of society, right 
[Yo yo they killed your style] Yo yo, I ain't letting shit ride 
Dropping the verbs and nouns, antonyms and homonyms 
Covering my dick, plus I'm diesel like all of them

Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on [somebody, help 
Me!] Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on 
[You gotta rock on] Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on 
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on 

My momma used to tell me turn that shit the fuck off 
So I had to play like Foxy and get off [get off] 
My shit was thick I bought a clip then cocked my own grip at honeydips 
'Cause moms made enough loot just to pay the bills with, beeitch 
Selling bags from uptown 
Me and Lester put our money together now we got the block locked down 
31 to local A-Train's, Hoboken 
I took the back way, New Jersey transit cops were open 
I'm hoping, that they don't go inside my boots 
'Cause we had everything, from jewelry to Thai-one suits 
And client el, I'm drinking Ballentine L in hell 
So Redman rock well before our record sell 
Then my moms crib was jacked by the jealous 
[And if ya ain't come back] Is what the base-head used to tell us 
[Yo fellas!] Our whole scheme sinking like boats 
'Cause Les mixed biz with pleasure when we should of stuck to lactose 
But every good thing comes to a end 
With no ends, on the block, selling weed again 
My moms tried to make me go to school, I just didn't listen 
Got locked up, now I'm all in the system, listen 
 
Whats up! I tickle your putty-cars with my loonie raps 
On groovy tracks, I make new jacks catch convulsions like groupie acts 
From my city I spread it all like Jiffy 
It's a mystery, my spliff be live like 145th be 
I mold like clay, and roll dice just like Andrew 
I stay strapped just like bamboo, my crews got mad handle 
Whatever, the weather be, I got mental telepathy 
So throw your bombest rapper and watch me intercept emcees 
I keep my car underground just like the Lords 
Even though I'm known, like all the four wheels on the course 
So let me pull up to your bumper like Grace Jones

Funky Noble Productions represent for the nine four and nine five area

(Nah I thought that shit was a fuckin plane dude) 
Nah nah nah, it's Soop, Soop, Soop-a-man

But I ain't switched, still a honeydip is a honeybitch 
in the mix! So bitches be lookin fly and I'll run in em 
With they toes and nails done, hair wrapped up with pins in em 
Fifty-four eleven Reebox bitch which you need not 
to do is get fly, cause where I'm from, bitches get speed knots 
Slow your monkey ass down and hold your horses 
Don't want to know your name don't want to know none of your sources 
Just fix me, with a quickie, I swear more Lake's than Ricki 
So bad I use my X-Ray vision to give y'all clits a hickie 
And plus the weed I puff is from the planet of Cheech and Chong 
Where the earth is chronic, and How To Roll a Blunt is the theme song 
Oh you makin me horny! Well uhh, let me wipe that wetness for ya 
Slurped and burped, got that bitch more open than my door do 
Let's take a journey up in the stars where I live at 
Where I fuck Jane, Judy Jetson, and that robot bitch-ah 
Grab onto the cape and uhh... I said before I took her 
don't choke me! And it's up up and away I took the hooker 
And it's on 

We landed on my planet, we smoked out like a fuck up 
Bought a dime from Jabba the Hut and some uncut for the hooker 
She said, ""I don't sniff blow I just smoke weed to get me horny. 
So I'm nothin like that bitch in your last Soopaman Lovah story."" 
You go girl! But I didn't believe her, had to make sure 
Where you from, the projects? ""Yeahhhh, but I'm single. 
You needed a quickie and I'm just that bitch to break you off, shit 
my pussy's so good, it tickle my legs when I walk!"" 
Oh really, just show me a couple of ways how you'll thrill me 
She lifted up her dress and the whole area got chilly 
""So what you think of that?"" I threw that bitch back on my back 
Shit I live ten miles away, but I made it fo' seconds flat 
I lived in the same building with Mr. Spock and Captain Kirk 
Got R2D2 and Mork from Ork puttin in work 
See I got the block sewn ""Oooh baby let's get it on!"" 
About time, I opened the door she had her ass and tits showin 
She rushed me to the room and stripped me out of my attire 
She tied me to the bedposts then she lit the room on fire 
She took out a scarf wrapped it around my eyes till I was blind 
But with my X-Ray vision I saw the icepick from behind 
So I broke out the ropes, smacked the hoe, then suplexed her 
She pulled out a Tec and wet my chest with the S1's 
""Oh shit I'm shot!"" There was blood all over my finger! 
I think I left my other bulletproof suit in the cleaner 
She gave a whistle, they came in crews, word is bond 
It was a bunch of Martian bitches with bodysuits and Platforms 
""Damn, I gotta think of a plan, whatamIdo? 
Did Superman have a gun?"" Nah, but the Soopaman Lovah do! 
So I pulled out the fo'-fifth, left the bitches open 
Had another clip in case some mo' bitches want mo' shit 
And I saw that trick Bewitched flying on her broomstick 
Pa-dow! Shot her down because I leave no witness 
Job well done I cleaned myself in a hurry

I'm smoked out  all you MC's  pull your books out 

Word is bond it's on I get at Dawn like Marvin Gaye 

Starvin since the days of Kindergarten 

When I dye my ashes, flip my coffin backwards 

Blow shit up like the 4th of July, with half sticks 

And on and on, to the break of Rae-Dawn Chong 

I'm Killin You Softly with this song, with this bomb 

I'm like the Bronx, 'cause I Boogie Down

Winicumuhround, homeboy watch yo nugget 

(Aiyyo-yo-yo Redman, yo that was last album) Aiyyo fuck it, bust it 

The top, notch, look over your sess spots 

Get dumb like a whole bag of jumps with red tops 

Burn more steam than carpet cleaners 

I'm meaner then I'm iller than OJ, catchin a misdemeanor 

Boom-bash I set it off (right right) 

I shot up your lights while you caught up in the heights 

My lyrics starvin, my crew runs like the mob and 

The funk butter cup, cause I'm a bastard at robbin 

I shake the valleys over Cali when I'm spliffed up 

Rock a fifth up, that measure nine point oh on the Erichter 

Are you tuned in to my tunes it's boom 

y'all niggaz couldn't see me if y'all had zoom 

I'm accurate like Acura, my style's ninety years maximum 

Fuel-injected like a Maxima, wheni'muharound motherfucker 



The way I get wreck y'all niggaz call it mic check 

I'm vexed and if I got an itchy finger like Bernard Geotz 

With a pad and a pen I blend funky images 

That leave your girl hemmoragin for about two million and 

three years move along there's nothing to see here 

If I wasn't nice motherfucker I wouldn't be here 

Yeah yeah put metaphors inside a bracket 

Def Squad's in the house AND MOTHERFUCKER WE CAN BACK IT 

Come test your skills for real with a bomb bang boom bang 

The sound makes your brains wet 

with The Color Purple on a freight train 

The devil's the conductor 

Then take a trip to the darkside motherfuckers 

My funky pattern takes interludes around Saturn 

I'm more diesel than evil meant evil like Sebastian 

Don't try this at home kids, I zone with ET's 

And other alien type of MC's 

So throw your shit up in the sky, cause Redman's about to get live

As we take y'all fat roly-poly asses on another journey
To the darkside...

Verse One:

Wuditlooklike? When I wipe off my sweat
Verbally I'm Untouchable like Elliot Ness
To the best of my ability I rock any facility
And fuck the yellow cabs I smoke buddha out deliveries

Cause the buddha I smoke, is no joke, when I'm loc'ed
Then I wet it, then you be like -- that shit be soaked!!
I'm saggin my.... Karl Kani...
and Two Black Guys when I get busy like the L.I.
Well I, swing it back and forth like a leaf
Without traffic I flow like the B.Q.E.
But I can pass niggaz straight out of first-class
Then leave em huffin and puffin like first day at Lemans class
PPP, got the glocks and techs
And Def Squad always got some fly shit on deck

I come hotter than Treach, you bet about callin the cops
Because (this type of funk you don't hear on the regular)
Rock six seven eight nine ten (to eleven ta)
Knew my style got more powers than Cocoon
Zoom your focus, I drop the mic and leave it smokin
When I'm vexed, my concepts Wreck like Effect
Verbal communications blow to the next ep
I'm robbin your brains with antilogical, phenomical
Suicidal with lethal type funk spread your nodules
Straight up the weight up plus I max like a Beta
Boy I fuck your head up like a blunt that's laced up
The boogie verbalist, vocalist

My style reachin down like Ike, switch up like dykes and
You'll be tellin your psychologist wuditlooklike

Verse Three:

Wuditlooklike suckers, punk motherfuckers
Bitches be actin funny, don't wanna show me no love cuz
They think I'm crazy and like mentally sick
Ahhh, give em the dick then they quiver like fish, then I
Smoke a pound of herb a day, and yo
Some bitches say, I'm the Mack like Maceo
I don't be that I just beez the funk disease
that leave MC's, recognizing like Sam Sneed
The funkindominal, I bring drama to any rendezvous
Rock three-sixty-five, twenty-four, Monday through
That other shit, makes them other ship, flip
funk ridiculous, inconspicous with lyrics
A-uhhm, oh-seven-one-oh-three's where I from
Been gettin dumb, every since Harlem World used to jump

I come rollin in when I see that low flow
Heckuva foe, heard a gun and settled for a metaphor
I'm naive between the sleeves of the sheets
Murderin, who should ever try to fuck with me
Murray word is bond gets it on
And ready to blow any nigga out the cypher of the sniper hype at dawn
Long live Def to the Squad
And we smokin everybody out there, shit it ain't that hard

Have your momma beg behind bars for your kidneys tomorrow
My murderous apprentice E Dub
Makes hard funk beats that I become part of

With a different type of swing

I turn around my baseball cap
I have a 40 sitting on my lap
Slamming the ivories until I sees
A female worth my while
I'm scoping it, checking a smile 
And I know that I can get it
And I'll hit it if she's with it 
I get the 5 to the 6-7 digits
Call her up on my cellular 
And all the shit that I'll say to her
The fun will begin when I hit the skizins
So if a girlie is lonesome
I think that she knows where to go when she wants some
'Cause Monty ain't here for nothing but I gotta let all

To find some things I want to get into
I call up my crew I tell them bring a brew
And some Hennessey for the beach party
So call up your girlfriends
And you know there always tends to be an ugly one
But bring her, too
Fat or skinny she likes to shoop
With Montell and the SL Coup
While the beat is bumpin' from South Central to Compton

Redman,"You find an MC like me who's strong
Leaving motherfucker's aborted, with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I get deadly as Kahn though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those
Who can withstand, the more power I gain
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck your brain
Imagine and keep on wishing upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstanding, faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced with it, I'm a ride
Breaking in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies

So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facing
We must be patient nothing better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waiting
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that ass shaking
I'm busting and making motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
But thugged out, forgive me Janet
Who's in control I'm activating your souls
You know, the way the games get controlled
You, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fucking rhyme I wrote
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat

I got my mind made up, come on (come on)
Get in get in too (get on it)
Let it ride (get wit it) tonight's the night
I got my mind made up, come on
Get in get in too
Let it ride tonight's the night

Well I come through with two packs
Of the bomb prophalaks for protection
So my fucking sac won't collapse
Cause nowadays, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifying like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfucking poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's the fucking bom-bay
Your got dissed, that's before it's ingest like balmay
My rhymes, I leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly vibes spread through your head like sand pine
There's no escape, nah I ain't blasting
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those asking
Opposed to laughing, raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killing
Why is that? 'cause smiling faces deceive
You best believe, to MC's I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under seige, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe, your vocab on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
Your already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat

Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler, sticking up (Jews) with German (lugers)
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this mess-age don't touch the dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket blow!
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellen
Half of my Clan's three deep felons
Niggas best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical then touch Tical
All up in your motherfucking mouth
Head banger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man roll too tight, you can pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and falling fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast

Hey yo, lyrical gas spitting the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this, mad underground basement, shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor who? Spock bitch don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless, the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust till every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out till your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
With, this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Then proceeds like keys
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit your fam' by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake or a snake bust it
I'm the one pushing the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke, off this anecdote got you ope
Get roast, by my lyrics Billy Dee .45 Colt
And I'm out for nine nickel (INS the rebels)
West, list this, this, this",Got My Mind Made Up,1996
Redman,"Verse One: Daz
You find an MC like me who's strong
Leavin motherfucker's aborted, with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I gets deadly as Kahn though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those 
Who can withstand, the mo' power I gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
Imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin, faded
would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard, I'm faced with it, I'm a ride
breakin in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies...

Verse Two: Tupac
So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin
We must be based on nothin better than communication
Known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waitin
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that asss shakin
I'm bustin and makin motherfuckers panic
Don't take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
but thugged out, forgive me Janet
Who's in control I'm acvtivatin yo souls
You know, the way the games get controlled
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin rhyme I wrote
Takin off my coat, clearing my throat

Chorus: Method Man
I got my mind made up, come on... [come on]
get in get in too [get on it]
let it ride [get wit it] tonight's tha night
I got my mind made up, come on...
get in get in too
let it ride... tonight's tha night

Verse Three: Kurupt
Well I comes through with two packs
of the bomb prophalaks for protection
So my fuckin sac won't collapse
Cause nowaday's, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electryfing like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's tha fuckin bom-bay
Ya got dissed, that's before it's ingest like balmay
My rhymes, I leave a mark on ya mind
As the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pine
There's no escape, nah I ain't blastin
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin
Opposed to laughin, raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
Why is that? 'cause smilin faces decieve
You best believe, to MC's I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
Ya whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe, your vocab on site
I'm out tha cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
Ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat

Verse Four: Method Man
Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
like Hitler, stickin up [jews] wit german [lugers]
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this mess-age don't touch tha dial

Elements, and it's coming through your block
Can't you smell it trick?
Wanna copy-cat my whole format
So you get funk tracks, punch lines and skull hats
Huh! Got a little Redman in town
Who's that effin clown soundin wack with the frown?
I don't know man, but you better warn him what I would do
Wild out on his staff like birds one and two

Newark, New Jersey, rock rock on, word is bond
I'm comin in swarms, so turn your flashlights on
Due to difficulty, my style flows while it travels across the planet
In 48 Hours like Nick Nolte
Droppin the flavor, stay Sky high like Pager
I'm magical like Fantasia on paper
I Saw the Light like Kraftwerk, of course
When the T-L-A Rock shock the stuff, It's Yours!
To your drawers, your record label got your staff gassed
Thinkin you gonna sell two mil cakes real fast
But you flopped, and your image choked like a tec
Now, who freakin style your ass gonna steal next?
Are there any more imitators in the house? There are no
Bust like NBA Jams, and you can have Chicago
Catch the cargo, funky like a bag of Bravos
Way back, when I used to pump 92 KTU and Carlos
Huh! I just stay funky like that
Make you wanna my style like a junkie on crack

Dribble the rock if you got the hots to get your knot rocked
Twice my device, Run-D.MC's from my Rock Box
Hey you, better Come Clean like Jeru
Before I take phase two and do another pay-per-view
To your crew, I give a boom bip to Q-tip
Standin tall like Shaq, honey I'm back, this ain't Blue Chips

One hundred percent funk runs blood straight through your nose 
I don't have to be Madonna to make your eyes freeze 
Visine's for eyes when you smoke the thai weed 
For this, you need a journalist scientist 
Keep your eye in this, funk cosmical, far from logical 
I blow the spot up in any hood or boondox 
Make the bully of the block move and get new locks 
Now who kicks that phenomical astronomical? Uh 
That's my nine in you, feelin nauseous that's my rhyme in you 
I swing funk like numchuks my game's death 
That's cool when I blind fools like Kareem Abdul 
Hot like lava's fire, sometimes I get more higher than cheech 
My funk speech make words wear sun visors 
I'm gettin down with the funk in your trunk 
Def squad's in the house, with the for all you punks

Ah, I'm just as high as three peeled up motherfuckers 
Def squad's in the house, with the for you suckers 
Punks, y'all chumps, I blew the frame once twice 
I'm dumb nice, I bring my worst lyrics to a gunfight 
The top notch, nah fuck that, that notch's topped 
I'm off the meter, I make computer's catch amenesia 
I'm swifter than roller blades on icecapades 
I'm fearless like four plus I'm cool like aid 
My grammar, slam from here to york, Alabama 
I never pull my pants up, I'm nutty like planters 
My style gets death like row or def like jeff 
Def like jam or squad, or death like meth 
One two! Big up to my niggaz on one deuce 
That cocks snaps and busts back at the boys in
Rrrrrah! With weed for you! 
Who says I can't burn shit up just like Lisa Lopez? 
I'm cause the ruckus, my area is fucked up 
You better off calling them Power Ranger motherfuckers 
Cause Redman will bomb just like Sadaam 
When I'm loose I'm worldwide like triple fat goose

Redman,"Amazing grace how sweet the sound is of the fo' pound
To blast all these sound men that got the po' sound
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfuckers here's the show down
But since we're broke now with dope sounds now here we go now
Check the motion while I be puffin the potent
Blow spots and urban networks with other experts
Plus this thing between my ear thinks clear
And the only thing it fears is the man upstairs
So fuck your bulletproof gear
If I decide to get your ass you better believe it's more than a blast
(boo-ya) More like rough paragraphs out Alcatraz
And ash, your staff, let the grime our your ass
Everybody's hustling with sons toting guns
Where Reggie Noble's from we stick nuns that got funds
Bomb niggas like they did in Oklahoma
Freez, you're froze, Def Squad UHH, case closed

I be the, sneaky, second dimension, seeping through your sector
Have nectar, leaking out you wack rhyme stressers
Extra deez disease leave rashes on rappers
Makin MC's so feel the breeze of the Grandmaster
Packed with swift solid style structure
Simonizing MC's with the degree of street ruckus
Aiyyo who got guns? I split precise, spleen splitter
Return my physical presence to the borough of the hard hitters
I devour, night sun shower, minutes last hour, weak man's last power
Body, the six four mind shotty
The one you handle, second dimension mind vandal
Lacerating your retina for tryin to see this
As I'm flowin through the prism of the X-3-D
See at forty belows I freak flows that burn your nose
When you inhale the verbal blows, case closed

Things ain't easy, cuz we be, strugglin day to day
A bunch of stressed black men with not really much to say
Twistin up some brown paper that we struggle just to get
All the deaf dumb and blind become mentally equipped
As I extend my pen to wreak havoc on paper
I execute and burn MC's like Absolut with no chaser
Strong as chemical the general with props
Past wreckin mics, I make the Earth shatter like the 7th sign
My drama bring about a new aura
I'm sending a plague through your town like God did Sodom and Gomorrah
The deepest, my vocals actions got you speechless
Make gangsta niggas wanna go home and talk to Jesus

My afro blows in three-hundred sixty degrees
So this makes me, the light skinned Richard Roundtree

And gregarious, pump that too, go grab the dictionary
Fly word that we flip on the M-I-K-E mike

Give me forty-eight bars, and I go out like gays at Billy Bear
Wear and tear, I'm wreckin for the Bricks I swear

Rockin' on, Redman rockin' on

Now do I look crazy? Deranged, maybe?
You shot first, your Glock burst, but it graze me
Now time for lyrics, put up your guns
And watch me get this shit hoppin like the West was won
Got that lyrical chicken feed, for all chicken heads
Crowd your Rap City committee like I'm Big Lez
More sicker than them Menendez brothers
You need Cochran when you're fuckin with Judge Dredd
Put your fingers up if you love hash and cash
I been that way since Ike Turner was kickin Tina ass
Hookers ridin dick, like I'm a motorcycle
You wanna shine bitch? Let me Simoniz you
I make sure your vision blur, till you don't know what occurred
Until I black out every nerve
Foul women get served as chicken head hors d'ouerves
I drop your tops like your heads was convertibles!!
Hah, if you still look up in the sky I'm still high
All the way live like Lakeside
Wann die? E (whattup son), you got this beat bumpin'
The way I feel niggas ain't leave until they up in somethin'
Pack my dutch like the niggas in the county
Dayrooms, stay tuned, for Doc Illuminati
Up around them big butt freaks is where you find me

To my people in the front, if you're tokin on blunts, say
Don't stop, the body rock
I'm too strong for you to listen
I started spittin, that's why the brick niggas be lickin
They stay on magazine printing equipments
And lyrics I got em by the shipment, where your bitch went
I'm smokin leaky out the Lec-y, fatal
My Squad steps with the ultimatum, true dat
My muzak, move crowds, like down the hill moved crack
For those who stepped on toes, I want my shoes back
Buddy, bringin money to your girl
For your little daughter like I'm Cutty
Twenty dollars a pop to dub me, I bug G, quote it
I see you noticed how I leave microphones corroded

The double-S vest nigga wreck the discotheque
Sit back relax and while my Squad kick tacks
Then tap your man back and be like ""Did you see that??""
Ahh yes, comin from the North South East West
Hold your nose and take a deep breath, recess
We bless, mics, three times a day
Three times a night, it all equals subliminal sequels
Strictly laughing at MC's
Lyrics for years that run more than ten deep
Niggas be like ""Ahh he changed his style up""
Shut the fuck up, ya still a dick-ridah
It's nine-six so get wit' it
Peep that back-in-the-day shit when that other Squad was Hit-tin
Listen, must we forget, I originated
All that wild shit, that rrraahh rrraaoowww shit
That jump up and ready to fuck shit up now shit

First of all, MC's be on my balls, straight up
Pubic hairs and everything, lick the whole plate up
Bay Area, roll up your Las Vegas
To all MC's, I love it that you hate us
Drop skills that might send wind chill factors
Back through Patterson, J.C
And Hacken-sack
Step uncorrect and get blackened
The assassin, find da MC's by the jazz men
I don't tote guns I tote funds
While you still puzzled how my antidote runs
Your whole vocabulary's played out, admit it
Still wack if it came out my mouth and I spit it (Get on down)
You remind me of school on a Sunday
No class, beatin all King's down
Doin over seventy, in a Hyundai, blast
Give em a good reason to open Alcatraz
Back, nobody got the Red shook
Been a weirdo ever since the doctor said PUSH
Def Squad skills make it hard to overlook me
That's why the hardcore promoters still book me
You shook G, word up, hah hah

Aiyyo, don't ride the dick of these real MC's
We pull Joints like Spike and blow crews to degrees
Then we buy G's with a half a pound of dope MC's
We bag for cheese just to get weed
Smoke indoneez I'm milky like Magnese
Oh-seven-one-oh-three, rest them car thieves
Guzzlin quart for sports of all sorts
Nonchalant spark buddah on the front porch
At courts, F-U-N-K-D-O-C
S-P-O-T, feel the Solo type remedy
Then freeze.... (Get on down) hah, ha-hah
Where was I? Oh yes
Sippin on Cristal with fingers up your bitch dress
Don't play close cause jealousy make folks act loc
Another nigga smoked from impression
Second guessin my verbal weapon, you're lettin
Spit, sixteen bits, come equipped
And I still walk around with the hooked up
Motorola flip on my hip, fuck the government
Drop shit, it's a microscopic topic
How I stay mo' bent than McDonald arches
And uptown got the la-la spots
And bad ass hoes with 54-11 Reeboks
But still, I walk around with the grill
Cause niggas be blinded by this hip-hop shit for real
I ain't havin that, I'm clappin shit
Fuck this rappin shit, I cause accidents
To any, MC who wonder what got in me
To get busy, it's simply Ginger and Remi

Redman,"I'm the bomb, ringing off all types alarms
My palms, be swift with the pen like Lynn Swann's
Aggravated assault, against an MC
Beat him down with the mic and all types of pedigrees
It's mad real in Da Bricks, plus I roll thick
You can quote this, I'm the Moby Dick of dopeness
Bitch, walk the walk if you talk the talk
I DK New Jerz, and DK-New York
I don't push a lot of vehicles, but I push a used one
With a tape deck, if it's feasible
Tell the truth, I don't own a Lex Coupe
But I get you souped when I rock respect due
Ice a nice nigga that wanna get diced
Slice the mic device like the body of Christ, twice
E Double if you feel me hit me once
(A breaker one, a breaker two)
Cause trouble to your family and friends
Let me cut the bullshit, just hand me yo ends
Got caught out there cause you were Mack without 10
Punch you in your chin, the rucker, bringer, live from Hell
But stay cooler than a double L
Turn a felony to a misdemeanor
Now the court subpeonaed me to get my act cleaner
Fuck that, still walk out holdin my strap, blunt, grabbing my weiner

Rock da spot
Yo

Now first of all I go for broke, check the third quarter note
I make you feel like your water broke
Can't tell whether male or female
I fucked up your frame well, the monogram can't tell
All aboard my balls, cause my dick
Don't got a lot of room for the rest of y'all
Grab on my pubics, let my music take flight
Rock indo and out-do, dick run in and out yo
Bitch, about nine inch up the clit
Can you feel me comin, yeah I usually make em shit
I shines MC's up for auction
So I can sell em on Saturday, Keith put the bat away
Let's lay in the cut, so we can break his whole anatomy down
And turn into an ass-kicking holiday
Word, I rolls with the Funklord
With more flavors than them motherfuckers on them Benetton billboards
He's bleeding get the gauze
He shoulda knew Def Squad crew is who I kill for
Push the clip in, slide the top back
Make sure it's off safety, in case he wanna counteract
Shit like that get me vexed
So I crack your ass like corn while your bitch crack my Beck's

Rock da spot
Yo

Aiyyo, catch this picture, of me in the mixture
So you won't forget the black Jack the Ripper
Sorceror offin y'all with techniques
A universal lingo, with the odd speaks
Control more blacks than Harlem week, freak
Smokin that leak at full peak
Peace to Greg Street, and underground radio technique
College radio, know I mack shit like Maceo
Yeah, the East coast West coast dick giver
I oughta be an alkie, the way I hit liver
Deliver, the milk to your door
Real raw shit you never seen before
So when you come inside, and do the front
Watch the double-pump shotgun and please don't run
Relax your minds, let your conscience be free
And get money, and G's and roll these trees

Aiyyo stash that weed up while me and the cop is riffin
Damn I knew I shoulda got that stash box built-in
But it's alright cause me and my niggas roll tight
We all think alike, we jump out whoever packin pipe
Don't they know who's the freak from the East?
I get faded like Chong and Cheech without bleach
And started spittin game 'fore these cops start to reach
On these creeps, showin mentality from the streets
Even though we had a half a pound by the seats
My peeps never tweek, we handle shit when there's heat
Since one cop was white the otha was a brotha
I pulled out my tape and front page of the cover
Of The Source, told him me and Janet's on tour
Broke it down to who's my boss and who I rap for
Plus them niggas, EPMD
Put me D, now I'm runnin with the Green Eyed B

The mic's on so I stress it
Shit I'm haulin ass before I start undressin
Niggas on they knees with they hands on the top of the
Heads while the Feds crack jokes with the Glock in ya
Don't get me wrong I know a lot of cool cops
That'd let me go if I had two Glocks and oowops
But, I don't, so, I keeps it, real
The five hundred series with deep dish peels
Quick, my bitch, stash, two clips, between her two tits
Before the cops fuck with the Rrr-ah

Yo, hard beats like this keep my mentality raw
I G off C 4 lyrics to blow off them Lex door
My tex-ture be the kind that explore
MC's, I blow 'em out, metaphor after metaphor
I'm more wetter than your boy bigger
So how you figure you can fuck with this rap unemployed nigga
I should own a fly bitch house and a Benz
But I got chickenheads criminals and broke friends
That love to get ends, keep the seventeens spinnin'
Pull out from my jaw linin', commence to splittin'
Brains and body parts that motion couldn't picture
Cause when I'm shittin' niggas hit more decks than a skipper
Mr. and Mrs. Howe, Mary-Anne and Ginger
Gilligan, you need the Professor to take the rigor-
Mortis out, I got orders to kill em softly
I wouldn't leave a trace if I died and police chalked me
Who's the Boss G? You better radio the walkie talkie
For these Fatal Attract MC's that stalk me
Got a big dick in your bitch clit
When I flip this I got more work than a Olympic gymnast
Bust it, I cut the mustard, on any track
Milkier than Similac when I'm next up to bat
""Redman is on the mic and I'ma""
""Dope motherfucker, yeah, you best ask somebody""

""Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop""

Fuck the talk I walk whatever I claim to do
Knock a mule on her ass and turn the pussy black and blue
You couldn't run up if your Fighter was Virtua
I'm a round-the-clock lyricist, I sleep in my work boots
It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate
It's a thin line between the trigger and the finger of a thirty-eight
Dust by far, my rap repertoire
Be the art of murderin' makin' it hard for you to spar
We can chill and puff the ganja, but don't be mad when the
Funk Doctor Spock smoke it with your baby mama
Get off my dick and tell your bitch to come here
Male groupies gettin' shaky when I come from the rear
Hah, that get on your nerve neighbour that play the
Music loud as fuck three in the mornin' off a paper
With mad Zul in the L-S-C
In the downtown area, scannin' the perimeter
All my boos with the open toed shoes
If you ain't gettin' that pussy eaten right, let me show you
Then let you taste these, this Brown Fox said
""Ain't No Nigga like the"" -- Funk Doctor Spock G

""Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop""

As I dive into the crowd
I wanna see who the fuck gettin' loud
Who the fuck runnin' off at their mouth?
I let my nigga 50 Cent knock that ass out
Word bond, bitches talkin' bout pourin out Cristal
And Dom P they better stick to Chandon
Blackin' out wildin', smackin' out weaves
Breakin' niggas cheap ass chains and medallions
You're just a part time sucker in the game
Shit is real motherfucker start namin' names
And if you name my name I whoop ass like Steven Seagal
Give you Under Siege 2 without the fuckin' train
Let your brains hang from the 808 bang
And if I wrecked your cipher then my Squad is to blame

You probably know some bitch niggaz who wanna murder me
Busta Reggie Murray Ramp and Mercy's all we need for disaster
For me the microphone master
Look, I crash ya, bash ya skull
Fucky with Mally G if you're trying to take a fall
Niggaz talk about killin and never get to it
Fuck the yappin, be true to it, do it
Steady scream about your East and your West side
But you ain't in it when it comes to the homicide
Niggaz better get up off that bullshit quick
Caught up in the limelight gettin way too slick
See em at the shows bout to rock they shit off
Gettin they peeps fucked up cause they block is soft
As for terror, I sever the best of MC's
Look, little Mally G trippin off these indo trees
About to murder label's jerkin but mercy us
Def Squad niggaz prophesize like the Perseus
Droppin degrees to zero with flatlines
Kill your whole entourage off with just one rhyme
One rhyme... one rhyme... just one rhyme
I don't give a fuck I kill em with just one rhyme
Woo, hah, heh, yahah, you wish that you could get with this
Terrorist, lyricist, for your era it's
My time to shine and I'm still payin dues
And I'ma be famous on either rap or the news, motherfucker
I only tell you nothin but the real it's
tight up in the struggle tryin to get this fuckin meal, why?
Niggaz act shifty so I shift a long
three tri three chrome, it's the same ol song
I seen the shades and the suedes from afar Pah
But hold up do you know who I are?
The M-A-Double, you want trouble you got it the spot is on
You blot it I got it then shot it it's hot up in your dome
Peace with the chrome piece that I pack
Remember fuck around and catch a Mack to your back

Who the fuck I be I, you cannot see I
Flabbergasted, blasted, my Magnum P.I.
Oops I lie, I got a cannon bout the size of Grand Canyon
I'm prime time, giving MC's Knots Landing
Duck, heavens to fuckin Merkatroid
I drop noise that employs the unbelievable
Recline like receding hairline, crime speaks fine
with a nine pull line blind keep mines up my sleeve until
you start to quiver, metabolism splits rivers
I rock so many broads I leave your entourage tender
Like bartenders mix liquor
I serve you over the rocks, I feed you to my flock, now time to click triggers
Manslaughter in alphabetical order for four quarters
raw water turn sons to grandaughters
Ah ha ha ha ha!  I bring trouble where, you sleep
So I double dare to bust you in your bubble bear, coat
Antidotes cause gunsmoke in Tokyo
MC's dosey do your mics up in this rodeo
My star roast em up by the thousands, millions, quadrillions
Shuttin down national state buildings with high ceilings
Funk Doc to the spot freeze
Creepin on MC's like Vietnamese in army fatigues
Def Squad representer
Hit yo' ass up from the bottom when you enter

Hey yo once a crack head, always a tack head
You have no craftibility all that shit you talk is dead
As sex drugs and violence, balance the scales of reality
Y'all don't want no parts of Keith Murray
I'm nicety and sheisty, I get that ass iced deliciously
Niggaz ain't shit to me (word up)
You stupid niggaz always got somethin smart to say
And probably can't even spell TWA
My crew is like police pull up and park anywhere (ERRRRR)
Jump out and get it on right then and there (whassup whassup??)
Niggaz is pussy and ways and actions show it
Most of y'all niggaz dead, and don't even know it
And Def Squad L.O.D. for life (word up, yeah fuck your life)
Act trife I'll let my dog cold fuck your wife


Aiyyo, you just heard the sounds of Mally G
Redman, Keith Murray, bringin the ruckus, the Def Squad
Next up is the Flipmode Squad, this is Howard Cossell
First up to the ring Rampage the Last Boy Scout
Lord Have Mercy For, and the In-fer-mous
Busta Rhymes

Two one two, I'm living life as a rugged MC
When I step up in your jam yo I'm V.I.P.
Niggaz and bitches be eyein me
I'm spontaneous, I'm wreckin brothers out the frame
Because I'm dangerous
I'm well known like Keith Murray and my boy Reggie Noble
Chickenheads get gassed, so they call me on my mobile
I'm great distance like AT&T
I stroke like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Yo I Fades Them All like my man Mally G
Whip a nigga ass for free
And makin sure he see visions of me
Rampage the talk of the town
The stalker of New York that fucks up the underground (no doubt)
I'm comin thorough like a pack of Life Savers
Ask Marley Marl who's the real Future Flavors
My technique I freak seven days a week
I'm undefeated, you can see my Quantum Leap
I'm hittin brothers where it hurt, lyrical expert
Those who got no publishing they need to get jerked (no doubt)
a hundred percent, I gets down what I invent
Rap artists be dying to a certain extent
Sometimes they use the underground to make a comeback
That shit is wack, fade away and never come back

For now and forever, it's the, evil that men do
Mental, my inner center Winter
Frosted froze crews inventor, inventor
Invader, evacuate I collapse your major
Straights and lose minds
You're splits two times, for intruders, for these losers
My maneuvers, drop like lugers
Illegal, maybe Lethal, like Gibson's
Splittin blessings, with three Weapons
Lay in the cut like C-Sections, infestin the nine-six
For you mindless, niggaz I smack spineless
Or lay back like recliners, as inject jewels
As flesh, moves, when in vaginas, oooh, oooh ooh ooh
Corrupt your minors, like New York City's finest
lineups, on LSD fine fust, in your sinus
Crush like chinas, opiuMC grinders
My dust, these rhymers I hijack like airliners
The infiltrator, creator, I'm sinful
Papers stay viscous like religious cults
Leaders that drop scriptures, and rock clips or assault heaters
My Flipmode niggaz, we're like Afghanistan guerillas

If you want more information look listen and read
While I sit back and I roll another fat bag of weed
We about to take control of your set like cruise control speed
Satisfy my lyrical semen, plants my Johnny Apple-seed
Mental slave grip on your brain like white people
My music will dominate the population like black people
Utilize my efforts to execersize my inner thoughts
I capitalize on my many and various styles of all sorts
Hold down the forts smokin drinkin mad quarts
For sports talk to chickenheads in botty lik shorts
Let's get the cream so that we can move up in this fortress
Bounce to art galleries and purchase exotic portraits
Here we go again, another phenomenon when I get on
Busta Rhymes and my nigga named Stretch Armstrong
We represent the ultimate unit for the nine-season
Flipmode Squad will bust your shit for even the wrong reasons
Chaotic sample make a nigga wanna get down
Till they come through like the ATF and shut your shit down
Alcohol tobacco and firearms is how we movin
Raw rapid fire flows while the music keeps you niggaz groovin
I don't know who the fuck you really think you foolin
You're so far from up to par and your shit needs improvin
From your conversation the way you come across your shit is off
Malfunctionin my nigga you about to feel the real force
Lay you on your face while I beat you up your head with the holy cross
Exotic niggaz blastin off to the Land of the Lost
If you can't see this
I recommend some school for the blind by Helen Keller
Big ups to Lord Have Mercy, Rampage and the Cella Dwellas
Redman and the Rockafellas
Big ups to Mally G, Keith Murray sunny days and bad weathers
But still we travel the world like National Lampoon
It's Busta Rhymes for the whole entire ninety-six SO STAY TUNED!!!

Your mic's in my possession,I crush you with aggression
An' I ain't talkin for niggas that learn a lesson
So why should I sit around and let this fake fuck pass my eye
Fake niggas fuckingg up my eye
Filthy with nasty it's the slog for the job
Forget any clan said ""who squad the mob?""
Tired of beat-down,shot up and robbed
Niggas askin why,it's my motherfuckin job
How many ways can I say ""I just don't give a fuck!""
Runnin niggas over in every truck
But my motto is ""fuck!get the bottle!pass the bottle!""

Look aat these weak MC's getting G's
Never wore BVD's or even bellbottom Lees
Please, with these fantisies about you selliing keys
When you know you bees in front of the TV eatin' grilled cheese
On your knees you know my steez
Kris is nice with theses M-I-Cs
I'm Poison like BBD the plot thickens while I be hitten 
And lyric lickin', flippin' any mix and over the skippin' 
And cable clippin', still sickenin' 
Even though some people ain't admitting
Through they system I keeps it kickin'
And tippin' the scale I pay tuiton not bail
Drink water not ale, MC Hammer hits it right on the nail
I can't fail with my 7 stripes
Strike one pierces the lung over the drum MC's become dumb 
Like ""um?"" They numb, bite the tongue over the bass drum
I am D the MC like Run, spittin' lyrics for fun
And for a sum of the bread crumb
You missed when you swung, I connected whole hum
Another one done underestimated KRS-1, yeah so...

[Chorus]
Redman: Say blowe
KRS-1: If you really want true skill
Redman: Say blowe
KRS-1: If you want the hip hop to build
Redman:Say blowe
KRS-1: We rock it all year round
Redman: You better cool the F out before we go up in your mouth

It's just beguuuun, to bubble
KRS-Onnnne spells trouble
On the mic soooon there is no double
I emerge from under the rumble
Count the truth poetic construction, audio abduction
Showbiz production for wack lyric reduction 
And fly rhyme instruction keep the party hoppin'
Keep the DJs buggin' for the orthodox 
Non Xerox hip hop chatter box
It was dope first crack out the box with Scott LaRock
How MC's are washed up like sweat socks
KRS-1 makes the heads nod

[Chorus]

Redman: KRS-1
KRS-!: Yes my son
Redman: Tweet tweet (x2)
KRS-1: You know they can't compete, ain't that right
Redman: 
No doubt. You better cool the F out before we go up in your mouth

When it's my turn kid, look at what you done did
Like my head is dreadable you edible
I kick incredible shit, for my poeple
I'm jackin' these like me so sue and Stretch like Bobbito overloops
While you sittin' on stoops I'm rockin' mics for U.S. troops in group
You screwed up, oops, I can read a true crook
Like I can read a good book
I'm hooked on hip hop culture
Look at the tip top lyrical structure
Floatin' like a soap bubble that you don't wann puncture
Or rupture, I write what I udder, mother mother mother
There's too many of us dying still trying and not doin'
Not succeeding still pursuing what you doing?
What you doing? What you doing? 
The session is started departed on schedule
I beg you please lookover my lyrical menu
What other can't do I can do
Enhancing seven levels of your mental
I dismantel stress, you're listening to the advanced lyrical best
Worldwide qualified to administer any MC test
Stop guessin' class is in full session 
Now Showbiz show 'em how",Blowe,1997
Redman,"Alright everybody move back from the ropes
If you don't move back we're gonna turn this music off
and that's my word, move back!
Word is bond let's get this shit goin
Word up, it's the Funk Doc in the house
say hell yeah! HELL YEAH!
Say fuck yeah! FUCK YEAH!
Word up, it's the Funk Doc Spock you don't stop
It's my man KRS you don't stop
It's the girl Angie you don't stop
With the hah haha ha haha hah!!

It's the Butter Pecan Rican speakin deletin
other radio jocks that think they competin
they pre-sweetened, like candy, I'm hot like pepper
Big up to Sandy but my name is Angie
Martinez, what a true microphone fiend is
Steppin up lovely with MY, AD-IDAS
through your speakers, representin
boriquas, and all hip-hop rhyme seekers
You may think I'm crazy right, but I'm crazy hype
Slay this nice y'all, everytime Angie grab the mic
I jams it right tonight, not the hardest
But peep the style of this Puerto Rican Goddess

Aiyyo yo yo yo, stop the music!
Aiyyo back up off the ropes, man, word up!
Yo get from the off the ropes
Now aiyyo yo yo, KRS-One, come again the selector!

It's been a long time but we made it, you waited
You gettin frustrated cause these MC's in trainin
Skills on the mic for a royalty save it
Pullin down rap so that others can't make it
They can't fake it in front of KRS they naked
That same old MC trend I'm here to break it
The highly conceptional multidirectional
Hot in ninety-seven so I guess I'm flexible
Rap relieve stress so yes I guess it's medical
All your wrecking and raping is still theoretical
Redman, you know you must understand (Whatup?)
Redman, you know you gots to understand (Hah! Whatup love?)
Angie, rockin with the one BDP (Ha, haha)
Representin right now at Hit Factory

One two hah, and you don't quit
It's Kris and Angie with the ultimate
One two hah, and you don't quack
It's Funk Doc smoke weed and don't smoke crack
Hahaha, hah, and you don't quit
Hoohahhahah, and you don't quit
I rock jams like, Samsonites with mics
Stage two boomin system and flood the lights
The lyrical, fo'-fo's lettin off like suppose
Reggie Reg is rockin on the ra-dioooo!
Hahh, huh, the oooh-child too chill
Caps peeled, Someone In My Bed like Dru Hill
Raise em up, cause I feel my spot can't be touched
No time for the Pauline jack, hit the clutch
Shotgun what?? It's the high exalted
Ruler of the buddha, the cash make my pockets
stick out like a tumor, for the consumers
I get busy with La Pluma, detonate the bomb
to make you hibernate sooner, certified luna-tic
My click run deeper than Charlie Tuna
Kahunas, raw for the able key movers
all over the hood like them Crooked I coolers
Bang maneuvers, from Jerz to Vancouver
Back to the Bronx with heartbeats ample looped up
I Blastmast like Kris, funk abyss
like a phone chauvenist with a Roley on the wrist
Sike!  I can afford it, less I slaughtered
three platinum niggaz and none of em prerecorded
KRS-One need to be runnin for office

Redman,"[Mr.Cheeks ]
Yo we come through like bulls nigga take two puffs and pass 
Nigga watch your back once you talk out your ass 
I back up 3 80 and my stash for protection 
Family is raged the world is acting crazed 
I never thought I'd make it it was hectic when I scrambled 
On point like a knife I'm takin' life as a gamble 
And living in the rotten apple yo where every core is rotten 
All my niggas rest in peace ya see you gone but not forgotten 
Now my main wifey, dead as shaded chicks, 
Official Lost Boyz since the year of 86 
And fuck these crooked niggas I could kill em with a passion, 
At times I feel like slashing in Jamaican Queens fashion 
You think you can fuck around, but kid you're just thinking 
It's over when I'm sober, imagine when I'm drinking 
Without blinking man, I'll tare your crew like pages 
I'll rip you from the backyard of ? ... 

[--A+ ]
A plus the lyrically superb one, spittin rhymes 
Off the top of the tongue to burn ya ear drums 
Rotten shit, make the opposite team call a time out, 
Knockin niggas three times my size out 
The crowd loves me, so when I ain't around they ask for me, 
I buckle up to kick rap like a crash dummy 
For the fast money, I get up in that ass money 
The fact you tryin' to test me kinda bugs me 
I leave crews fed up, like handicap niggas tryin' to get up 
Emcees get wet up with lyrical gun pillars, 
I blow up the spot when it's time to rock 
I speak through a mic my voice peak out at a hundred watts 
Who want to fight son, I get dumb 
Word to my mother the father the holy ghost and Rev Run, 
When the Source set it down, I'm inner serviced 
To cop the type of verses that average emcees seem to worship 

[--Redman ]
My style is milking magnesia, clutch divide speeding bust 
The more the merrier, secure the area, my life familiar 
Is ultimate superior we don't jack cars 
We jack for aircraft carriers 
I bounce like trampolines, when I be blowing the feces to pieces 
Hymn em like sewing machines and Jesus 
When the shadows of the barrel pointing out my (?) Camarro 
I get punished like pharaoh for splittin' 
You're better off singing Christmas carols for Christmas, 
Because I'm on point like bow and arrow equipment 
The president of chicken head conventions 
I give you a deluxe Ku Klux lynchin' 
I got a headache from the stress, success not wearing a vest 
5-11 for being dirty and quarts of 9-30 
Yo, Mr.Cheeks, I made this bitch call police 
She tried swallowing a nine piece 
Forgot the warrantee on false teeth 
I return like Makaveli on 18 inch Pirelli's 
Assault and battery like my palms was ever ready 
Sharp as machete's 
Matter of fact I slap (?) ... 

[--Canibus ]
Canibus brings the sickest drama, 
Fierce enough to pierce the thickest armor 
I smack bitches who try to suck dick through a condom 
Playing with the mic is something I won't do 
My only concern when I approach you, is to roast you 
I smoke you and whoever you standing close to 
And make every man in your crew deny that he knows you 
Defeating, niggas like Segal Steven, 
Putting Emcees in, positions to prevent 'em from breathing 
I'll make you question any and everything you've ever believed in 
By peeping your deepest secrets like psychic readers, 
What's the matter with ya'll, I splatter ya'll 
Against the mutha fuckin wall with these raw lyrics I catapult 
None of ya'll got the balls big enough to battle, 
I go On & On like Erika Badu 
A hundred times nicer than the best there is 
Twice as African as KRS is, who want to test this 
Fuck y'all you don't impress me and no one can test me 
An Emcee so ill, I got AIDS scared to catch me 
All that shit you poppin will stop, when I put you in a headlock, 
And apply pressure until I crush your mutha fuckin noggin 
I grab mics and push niggas to the left 
So fast their hearts end up on the right side of their chests 
My hypothesis, is that nobody can see this 
Lyrical genius, I got it sown like a seamstress 
But if you want to battle, I'm down, 
If you got nine lives, I'll take eight of them off your hands right now 
Step up and get your neck cut from ear to ear 
If you survive, then you can cover your scar with a beard 
I'm the illest from Queens to the new Jerusalem briddicks 
Anyone who ain't feeling my shidick can suck my didick 
You need to quit it, if you ain't spitten 
More than 50 bars per minute cause you ain't in lyrical fitness 
Kickin' boring raps with metaphors that's wack 
All of ya'll mutha fuckas need NordicTrack 
To get ya weight up, fuckin with Canibus you get ate up 
Get beat down and sprayed up, just for bringing my name up 
Been rockin longer than niggas twice my age 
Back in the days before Bob Marley was rockin a fade 
Before Honest Abe signed the paper that freed slaves 
Before Neanderthals was drawing on walls in caves 
I existed, in the garden of Eden gettin lifted 
Stickin dick to Eve before she was Adams mistress 
Before Christ created Christmas, I been in lyrical fitness 
The Canibus is spitten till' he's spitless 
50 bars of total sickness, you won't forget this 
I'm puttin' every wack Emcee alive on my shit list 
Verbally vicious, tele-connectically gifted 
Took you a minute, to exhibit that I'm sick wit it 
Now you tell me who you think is damaging shit 
Going once, going twice 
Sold to that nigga name Canibus 
Me and Mr.Cheeks, A-Plus, and Funk Doctor

Gimme your girl gimme your keys to your four do' Explorer 
Yo Lu Nile crack their composure 
(We decompose your crowd) We layin down tighter than plaques 
When I blast I wild like them two bitches from Baps 

Yo, the Hong Kong Fooey, human tornado like Rudy 
Turning your bomb-ba-zee into doobies 
Platinum overseas like the Fugees, Japanese 
Germany groupies, mooshi mooshi, sniffin lines 
off each other's booty love the Luniz 
I went from smokin dubs to QP's 
Make hits for thugs that bankin hoopies 
and aimin uzis, at who dirty mackin my loochie 
Come clost cock the toast and make you see Ghost-s like Whoopi 

Have you ever seen a nigga get snatched up by his drawers 
And wonder the cause, 'cause big dope had his balls 
Got small methamphetimes with colors to be Cray-ola 
Took the drunkest O-A, and let the X take shit over 
No need to get juiced cause it's the anti-depressant 
Smile now but trip later, and put your hand out for the present 
Lay down for fifteen, so your body can feel rest 
Kick your feet up, and start makin beats on your chest and think

""Cold turn the party out"" ""I'd like to, I'd like to break it down down"" 
""Cold turn the party out"" 
 
Ahh ahh, I smoke Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Satur-dayyyyyyah! 
Two lay ya blunt, players with cream 
If I die my spirit will jump inside machines 
Runnin niggaz over like Christine (sorry) 
I mix the green with the last piece of hashish, ass-burning 
hoes in my black mink, your baby momma lovin my backseat 
Freak nasty got me slappin the ass cheeks of Blackstreet 

So high, I'm so high I feel like I'm wearin a disguise 
Superman type of, with Kryptonite eyes 
Not knowin I'm trippin, I walks out to my vehic' 
Buckle up for safety on my way to get some cheap shit 
I'm out the parkin lot, sideways on two wheels 
Vision is double, trouble to me is bein real 
Listen to my big block bill cause in the town that's a earful 
Shares and mo' shares, swang if it's good 

Now how I get dollars, I be the rap artist blue collar 
School scholars on knowledge to move dollars 
I do gotta motion chirp, like Impalas 
for niggaz who rock Timbs, Gortex, or new Walla's 
You're facin, the Cochise of operation 
And if you ain't tastin you should steady observations 
Doctor/patient, leavin mics with laceratons 
Love to stay bent with my doggs rollin adjacent (woof!) 
And when they bark they turn your sunny days to dark 
You play the back like Rosa Parks when the arc sparks 
I bang rawly, do you orally 
My horny sounds will pound more heavy than E-40

Bend your back like Long Isle Iced Teas with five liquors 
Knew about the cheddar since I took my child picture

Stop complaining, the game is for entertainment 
What is it when niggaz heads gettin covered with blankets? 
It's just a one-eight-seven on your motherfuckin crew 
I'll have your brains doin donuts like you in a rental 
Flip fools with credentials, nasty like havin sex with kinfolk 
Blaze high, then smoke 

Drunk-a-Lot, stays on top, that's why we roll 
two and two, four deep makes a crew 
Red Yuk and Num with the sidekick Hennesey 
Fuzzy, wuzza, fuzzy, little friend of me 
Hitters on the payroll, secure because we practice 
Pure ass-kick cures for who's acting drastic 
Drank and buddha blast, callin shots on Motorolas 
One step shy, so I'ma drank until it's over 

Kick this for the fake Versace wearin fake Donna Karan Mossino 
Players we know, ain't no gambino 
Peons be watchin too much Casino, wannabe Nino Brown with the uzi 
But clown you more like Downtown Judy 
Niggaz can't fool me, I love the way you ball outta control 
in your rhyme, then see you in person without a dime

Fuckin' punk, get a speed bump comin' through
A single shot make your knees knock, respect Wu

Hey yo, I put it on a nigga, shit it on a nigga
Turnin' Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (explodes)
While you got set up I was hittin' your ex hoe
Shit I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chicken-heads gobblin'
Shit I'm drivin' in, come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the chin, see
When I approach rappers be takin' notes
I drop like I should of invented the raincoat
Absolute, I love to burn to the roots
I keep comin 'til you pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you fuck you, my attitude is anemic

I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown witcha head still attached to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beatin' niggas to death and beatin' dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, ""Yo, how many rhymes you got?"" I think I'll go on
For more Milleniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run ta, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who want to see Canibus get wild, who want to act fly and
Get shot down with a surface-to-air missile
I take 'em on in all shapes sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred
When I'm blunted and I give it to any nigga that want it

Stay out the dark, 'cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you dog, believe that
Where we at, do your value your life, as much as your possessions?
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, 'cause it's, better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put you somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
Yous'a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby
So I can hit you up on front teeth, you think I'm sweet?
Want heat? One deep, leave him behind, front seat

You hold the rusty swords I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewhere cryin' on detention
Watch your mouth, better yet hold your tongue
I'ma do this shit for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis (LL Cool J is hard)
Every little boy want to pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like pickin' up a ball, playin' with Mike
Swingin' at Ken Griffey or challengin' Roy to a fight
Snappin', you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin' overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringin' a tiger cub to his knees 
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't want to borrow that, you want to idolize
And you don't want to make me mad nigga, you want to socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train

On my left, niggaz be rollin with the ruckus
Ready to get deep bust rounds upon some suckaz
Heard PPP and LOD is a bunch of crazy motherfuckers
Journey to the land is on
The winner of the spittin bomb marathon
The fuck you up lyrathon, whatever you choose
prepare to lose that title
Turnin vital situations suicidal, my idols, is my Uncles
who started smokin weed outta bibles
Gave me a puff when I bust my first rifle
Men-estration cycles, I give bitches
Bring your craziest nigga, I'll give stitches
Whateva, go crew for crew, blow for blow
Bang your headpiece and sniff the snow off your hoe
I keep it rollin

Ask yourself man
How ugly do you have to be to be a hardcore MC?
Niggaz be fooled by my plaques and my light skin complexture
My whole texture is bombin, destroyin da schools of the wack
From the Land of the Lost, you get tossed
Listen to my veloc(ity), my crew's comin off
Yeah, more sneaky than casino switches
Diggin ditches for all Moskino bitches
Clockin decimal figures, I'm gettin out diggers
Now my choice of truck is a Land
cause a Landcruise much bigger
It pack two to three more niggaz
Damn I hate a golddigger
Yeah, gimme that microphone
I make opponents shit bricks like Tyson's home
I keep the jacked cellular phone blown in three zones
Love seafood and keep my nine millimis chrome
So it can shine up your dome
When I proceed to give you what you need and clear spots like Sea Breeze
Wreckin your ass armaggedeon style
Twenty four seven while
My crew chin check your profile
(Rollin)

I'm the master of disaster, super rhyme maker
Grimy by nature, database maker
Play em out like Sega, Saturn
Blow your blocks in patterns for about nine acres
Testes, crew wearin bulletproof and double S's
Karl Kani down, camoflouge can't hide the sounds
of a fo' pound (boo-yaa)
Givin you Six Flags, bustin merry go rounds
But my crew stay ill with that unreal appeal
I be the raw water, my cheek bones outta have gills
below like the opera
Smooth on the trigger for all you block cockers
I be the key to criminology
Blast and rotate enemies at three buck sixty
Pick me, as your Senator
Take the dove from your battlefield son, fuck Pat Benatar
Run, head for the hills
Back in the day, these niggaz rolled up on me with
the trunk filled with Bomber Brooklyns, sheeps and quartervilles
Aiyyo take that shit, aiyyo Money snap the grill
Body caught chills as he ate this nine mil
Mine kills two but my nine was sign sealed
And ready to deliver, but Money had me too close
to reach for toast, soon as that nigga blink I broke ghost
Dash back to South Orange Ave with dollar bill to smoke dope
I keep em rollin

Y'all score game down the block, for me it's hip-hop
Around the clock, critical I'm bound to drop (stop)
You ain't know I'm nice girl, youse a Wannabe
Like the Spice Girls, you betta think twice girl
I'm untry-able, undeniable
Won't be held liable for givin knots that's untie-able
R-O-Z, recognize my name
Rap G.I. Jane rockin' colorful wide frames
Straight from Newark we Brick layers, Na Na slayers
Don't play I coach and pick players
In Da Bricks, get your shit popped locked and stolen
Step back I'm holdin', bitches be rollin'
Ghetto style, I'ma stay that ripper
Tryin' to get cash out the ass like a stripper

Dub O, I'm down for whateva, do what I gotta to get the chedda
Fuck takin' over cities, we conquered galaxies and better
I was put here to crush CD's and wreck tapes
Make a false move, I put this whole fuckin' planet in checkmate
Hell with this, we takin' over the spot
I don't like to, but I will resort to the glock
The whole camp is sick, you can't do nuttin but like it
It's like when you drown, your ass sink quicker if you fight it
Talkin' bout you used to rob niggaz with pump shotties
I know you love club music nigga, but you ain't got a jack in your body
You fake ass niggaz, gettin' screened like a short pass
And if you incorrect, I'ma diamond cut your bastard ass
You got mind control over me like Deebo but you ain't my friend
Cause when I'm around you be quiet but when I leave you be talkin' again
But we gonna do it how you want cause I'm widdit to brawl with you
Now what if I put your bitch ass in a headlock and fall witchu

Yo niggaz, shut your windows and close ya doorz
Comin' straight from Da Brick City

Yo niggaz, shut your windows and close ya doorz
Comin' straight from Da Brick City

Your bitch said aliens raped her and her four friends
But it was all the Outz, we dressed up as Martians
When I, crack a brew it's nuttin' else I'd rather do
Hop out a cab or two to your avenue to battle you
Your style get ate like italian steak
Then I get Red to sell you achey or a pound of shake
Y'all can open up wide and suck this dick
None of y'all niggaz can't fuck with Bricks
While you scrubbin' dishes, we puffin Swishers
Fuckin' women ends up in the Benz trunk with switches
We cop sixty-three nigs
One from every spot, blunts be mystery mix
We got, spots, all my niggaz stay in Bricks
While y'all stash clips in bags of Bar-B-Q potato chips
Plus your main honey loved us
Slip her some bom-ba she'll fuck twenty of us

Yo, you pack that little ass gun like Harlem Nights
After we brawl and fight, yo bitch I'ma ball tonight
At shows we so tight we flow like it's one mic
Raw underground, yo Don, tell em what that dough like

D. Don, I gets mine, and stay gettin' it
My thug mind'll brawl with rhymes and stay shittin' it
Check my shine, iced out platinum like your pendant
V.I.P. ghetto nigga, hustlin' and spendin'
Got bitches trickin' tryin' to get with me
Got police, flock niggaz tryin to cop from me
How many pouns you want, how many pounds you need?
I cultivate, every block I go and drop seeds nigga
I grow trees, niggaz know me, for bein' low key
That hustler from A.C.

I'm steady shittin' on hoes, Grand Royal like the Green Eyed Bandit
Jump straight in the Lex offa New Jersey transit
Let my man spit that Don shit
Gov-Matic spit that shit that's toxic, I rock shit
It's that hot shit like Busta Bust got

The Prime Timer sharper than barber shop liners

I spend so much money on chalk and the indo 
My weed supplier need to build a drive through window 

My form of art rock, jewels with Clarks 
When my bass sparks for fiends it disturbs the NARCs

Grab the intercom and yell, ""Fuck you!"" in the mall 
I drop it with the holocaust force, I got balls 
I get my pants fitted twelve inches bigger than y'alls 

I went to college, rockin' tie one below outfits 
Dropped out, but stuck my friends for college deposits 
Nigga, get a country nigga gun bustin' 
Like they saw Tupac with two glocks still thuggin' 
Fuckin' with a dog like me, I call your name out 
While you pussy niggaz call id, when I blaze 
You step life your wifee got a baby on the way 
The way I flex son you think I'm made out of clay 
I'm illin', my lyrics on the blocks make the killings 
I string your moms out until diapers take to chillin' 
I don't like to toot my own horn but I'm the shit 
And if you hearin' me I see you paid that twelve cent 

So peace to homey $hort Dog! 
Peace to that funky nigga Snoop Dog! 
Peace to that old nigga Dirt Dog!

You can feed they stinkin' ass Eucanubu...Dog!

I even kept a heartland for them white girls on magic garden

Ran my mama's phone bill for callin' Biggs Biggs Biggs

The lead patch was the shit if you snatch it right 
And everybody knew the pattern of pac man 
Rams was 15 and that then was happenin' 
Niggaz used to get robbed at twin city 
I was cuttin' on SL's glue with a penny 
When EPMD dropped Its My Thing 
I said damn I gotta get up in this rap game

I used to tell my Sis I'm gonna make it bitch 
So close to gettin' on I could taste the shit

In my last year at West Side High I barley made it 
Flippin eightballs, going to Montclair State 
I passed one class and still owe their ass cake 
For quick cash, Doc hit up 13th Ave 
Sell white boys oregano dash then we laughed 
That was the days now the times switched up 
Son either walk them dogs, snuff it or get snuffed 
Them ho's got triflin' but much thicker

Yo dial funk if you're mo' stiff than riker's isle bunks 
Get out your seat, e, spit out the beat 
The tracks plow underground concrete out the streets 
From baldies to fades, when I rock mc's wave 
More flags than puerto rican day parade 
And give up, I got the rare footage, of fiends walkin 
Barefooted off my rhyme don't dare cook it 
You might fall in to intervene 

And new jacks and they girl become pookie and that, prom queen 
That bodybag won't fit you tonight 
You want to blow up? Drop the mic, stick to the pipe 
Hand to hand my crew'll cripple your click in a fight 
Take my tapes way down south and triple the price 
Step up on the scene like whazzup? Hey suga' 
Before you cock-tease doc, how that cash put up? 
And only way I stop til your click say when

Of antagonizing anxiety attacks 
The beat hits the ground and the earth cracks

With rhythmatic articulation, god-forsaken 
Sick manifestations, pump pump in your face then 
The lyrical force that I put in a rhyme 
Will hit you with more power than a molecule enzyme 
No matter who what when where how I'll lay you down 
With a sick illed out fictitious style 

Yo, we all represent the hood -- the only difference 
Between us is that we make the shit look good!

Funk Doc is on a world tear jumpin' 15 000 feet 
out of plane in the air like where 
The next ghetto i'm gonna run 
I'm gonna shut them ear drums until you talkin' sign language 
There go son! 
Walls start to bleedin when my jaws is leakin' 
Doc do 200 first week your label call a meeting 
Yea i'm gonna let the gorrilas up in your building 
Kick your door, shoot up the ceiling 
Snatch the coke, kidnapp the children 
Don't start lying about your tire being flat 
Or catching a allergy attack 
I'll axe the battle and the bat 
Saddling them ho's like yeeehaw! 
Bitch enjoy the tour when you're fuckin 
the Doc 5 O'clock free ride 
Ambulance too late for them 
These paper thin niggaz robbin' at the ATM with a staple gun 
I'm a rookie scuba diver, Holler 
You rap scholars do the knowledge 
You won't make it through to college

Never wore those, My lyrics to the mic

And be like yo its on (4x)

Aiyo who fuckin' with us 
We bustin' your gut with lyrics 
You either feel it or fear it 
And smash the hardest artist regardless in steez 
I'm heartless with these (you ready) cock it and squeeze 
With precise precision you better listen 
Guaranteed to blow your vision if we engage in collision 
Talk slick and be laid out in chalk 
I still stay out in Newark 
And blaze my way into court

So I be in back of the bus unwrappin a Dutch 
Left court for child support  bitch attackin my bucks (WHY?) 
They want to fuck with certified private eye 
Every week, check stubs to show the judge I got a job 
Damn this; Soopaman used to stack them chips 
Now I'm broke cause little kids riding Batman dick 
I'm not a hater but the Caped Crusader blockin my dough 
And I'll let off before I push broom on HBO for Mr. Show 
I'm critically acclaimed; but the press'll fuck my name up 
Police is lookin for me, call the mayor he'a hang up 
Nowhere to run to and Brownstone even know it 
So I pack the fo'-fifth, and the ice on your wrist, forfeit 
No game; slappin all hoes who got the fame 
Then I rob em with chickens who got phone bills in they mama name 
(You've been framed!) Yeah yeah I know I gotta go out 
So I'm shuttin the game down like 30 nuthin blowout 
I rip the flow out, from the ceiling, if I spot cash peel it 
Soopaman Luva gon' switch to Soopaman Villain

Soopaman! Roll up a L for me

(Who am I?) 

[Redman] 
Yo yo, I'm back on deck, I never lost the pep in my step 
Ride in the cab, drunk as hell, weed and Beck's on my breath 
I'm undercover so I'm dressed in turtleneck and the vest 
Tec by the waist, yo cabbie make a left on the next 
corner, get out and let the 30-30 cock the loogie 
Tryin to set me up like Jim Kelly, MUY, MUY

Crackheads, hustlers, chickens, carjackers, thieves, hoes
All these mutherfuckers come out when the lights go out

So I gotta watch you fast bitches, too many tricks

Iron Lung I be the street soldier, ante up 
Pull them panties up, party's over, in the cut 
Slappin' grudges offa niggaz shoulder, bringin' ruck

Duke or sober, suave bowler, soul controller 
Of the universe, stole-a, colder than cola 
Caps grab your hoodie hat, Island of Stat' 
Keep them cats runnin for they gat, in stormy weather 

Gats, right hook, uppercut swollen how I left your eye 
Stage dived, made a mistake, kicked F.O.I. 
Ayo hoe! Doc be keepin' a dope show like Marilyn

I was put here to crush CD's and wreck tapes
Make a false move, I put this whole fuckin' planet in checkmate
Hell with this, we takin' over the spot
I don't like to, but I will resort to the glock
The whole camp is sick, you can't do nuttin but like it
It's like when you drown, your ass sink quicker if you fight it
Talkin' bout you used to rob niggaz with pump shotties
I know you love club music nigga, but you ain't got a jack in your body
You fake ass niggaz, gettin' screened like a short pass
And if you incorrect, I'ma diamond cut your bastard ass
You got mind control over me like Deebo but you ain't my friend
Cause when I'm around you be quiet but when I leave you be talkin' again
But we gonna do it how you want cause I'm widdit to brawl with you

Hop out a cab or two to your avenue to battle you
Your style get ate like italian steak
Then I get Red to sell you achey or a pound of shake
Y'all can open up wide and suck this dick
None of y'all niggaz can't fuck with Bricks
While you scrubbin' dishes, we puffin Swishers
Fuckin' women ends up in the Benz trunk with switches
We cop sixty-three nigs
One from every spot, blunts be mystery mix
We got, spots, all my niggaz stay in Bricks
While y'all stash clips in bags of Bar-B-Q potato chips
Plus your main honey loved us
Slip her some bom-ba she'll fuck twenty of us

Yo, you pack that little ass gun like Harlem Nights
After we brawl and fight, yo bitch I'ma ball tonight
At shows we so tight we flow like it's one mic
Raw underground, yo Don, tell em what that dough like

D. Don, I gets mine, and stay gettin' it
My thug mind'll brawl with rhymes and stay shittin' it
Check my shine, iced out platinum like your pendant

Got bitches trickin' tryin' to get with me
Got police, flock niggaz tryin to cop from me

Jump straight in the Lex offa New Jersey transit

Number one hit to get your roll on 

Another number one hit to get your roll on 

Ahh  anything I want boy 

Ahh  everything I need boy 

Ahh  anything I want boy 

They say that money 
Can't buy me love 
But they don't know this 
Tenderoni that I'm speaking of 
She's so fly 
From her head to her toes 
And  I suppose 
That's why I'm tricking off my dough 

So, if it's diamonds she wants, then I'll 
Dig into a mine, and search until I find 
And if it's furs that she needs to keep her warm 
I'll wrestle a bear, to keep her lovin' right here 

Anything she wants, everything she gets 
She wants it all the time 
So I'll provide and buy 
Anything she wants and everything she gets 
'Cause all her love is mine 
When she's satisfied 

Anything I want boy... 
Ohh, that's what she said to me 
She's a material girl 
But that don't bother me 
Check books, credit cards, American Express 
Financially I'm twisted 
And addicted, I confess

Yo son I ain't trickin' off .... 
.... better trick me 
Serving grade AD to A and TNC 
Something like AK nell 
Better fuck me for free 

'Cause when trickin' 
I do stickin' like IVs 
I told Montell spend your money like your .... 
If she yells Cristal 
Give her Double Deuces 
If she wants a mink 
Get her ass a goose 
She was shady before ya dropped (This Is How We Do It) 

Now my MO 
Hydro with a bimbo 
Da' CoCo got her Cabana' 
Out da window 
Iget deep like I stuck my feet in slow 
You jump out of bed 
Boggling, screaming TIMBO 
When a broad want ice 
Giver her ass an ice pick 
And then dismiss 

Like Vibe did Chris 
But diamonds are a girls best friend 
Yeah, yeah mine too 
That's why the 4-4 cocked right behind you 

{repeat chorus 2} 

I'll get your hair, nails and toes done 
I'll trick off all my dough 
To let you know that you're the one 
You'll like the car you drive 
The clothes I buy 
'Cause you're so fly 
Now tell me baby ... can Montell provide?

You are now witnessing the effects of the buddha! 
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. 

[Redman]
Redman kick through your door.
Liquidated then I come through your pores.
Think the track is bleedin'; get at the gauze.
Mix fidgit 'fore I rip it in four's. 
Look at my face; you can tell that I'm slick.
The blunt exercise; ten in the clip.
Y'all niggaz ready for the un counterfeit?
D-O, dot, b-bo; tuck in your shit.
That bogus holder of the sticky dolja
Got me appearing on the wanted poster. 
It's like when your body get caught on rotors.
Wnen I snap like strings through boat motors.
My kitchen fridge look like Jeffery Dahmer's.
Boys screamin' for mama from the drama.
My hunger for hip-hop got my gun up.
Yo, EightBall, hit the marijuana.

[EightBall] 
Yeah, yeah.
EightBall blazin' the hay, 
An hella pound almost everyday.
Real playas run the game that they play.
That's why I'm doin' it the playa way.
I say dope rhyme's, potent and real; 
Showin' skills all my homies can feel.
Smile at you; see the name on my grill.
Cut the track up; let me show you the deal.
I be twisted with that Redman.
We get it all; cookin' dope, makin' bread, man.
I got the eagle full of hollow tipped lead, man.
Hear what I said, man?
Can all that weak noise.
I write; busta, go and get your little weak boys.
You know what bring a player joy?
Playin' with them glock toys.
See, I avoid all suckas trippin';
Full of liquor, actin' like a bunch of women lippin'.
Interested in what I be grippin'.
Dippin' in the Benz, zippin'.
Pass all you haters, fakin'
Runnin' 'round, seein' real players imitatin'.
Breakin' concentration; all up in my situation.
Hay blazin'.

[Chorus]
Get y'all shit together.
Coffee shop we with; whatever.
EightBall stay high forever.
Yo Doc, keep it tucked under my lever.
We here to keep the party live;
Smoke hay till we chinky eyed.
Want to brawl?
We can meet outside.
Red and Ball be down to ride.

[Redman]
Yo, yo, look around you mothafuckers,
It's a hip-hop holocaust.
Yeah, you just found the right superheroes to take care of that shit,
Mothafucker.

[EightBall]
Head rush and green stinky, 
Feelin' like a nigga dropped a mickey.
Drink up the Hen, and watch me get tipsy.
Who want to ride with me; one hundred-sixty?
Up and down forty-eight, trackin',
Ski mask; kickin' doors in; straight beat jackin'.
Ball battin' rhymes all in your skull, crackin'.
Actin' like I got a problem that's heavy to me.
Smokin' brothers like a dooby in a gangsta movie.
MC's turn stank like a old lady coochie.
Ball and Red be all up in your shit;
So deep that it be damn near permanent.
So authentic you can tell it from conterfeit.
Who want a hit of the purest coffee shop crop;
Guaranteed to be bomb to the last drop?
Ball and Red keep it stone like Bedrock.
We keep it hot.

[Redman]
Yo, 
I'm the blackout mode.
I snatch cheese that your mousetrap hold.
Yo, who fucks ya baby?
Hey, Kojack knows my flows, Kodak
Couldn't hold that pose.
Wow.
Goofy playin' tough on the streets.
Blue collar MC's suffer the heat
Until I reach the isosceles heat.
Right angle better; double your sleeve.
I'm just a black, nation wide, singer.
Cops lookin' for Red, but can't arraign us.
You need more than lion trainers to tame us.
Famous for cuffin' mics with five fingers.
That's why I walk so distorted;
Any form of harsh aborted.
Word so superb it'll turn to herb if you snort it.
Fifty sack and a nick can vouch for it.
We keep it critical.
If you hard core: spit it out, out, out, out.
Doc, who be arousin' police?
My underground funk be plowin' the streets.
So if you claimin' you the best MC
Bring your arm over here and handcuff me.
We battle till the cattle learn to speak.
Cross examine me; I'm straight up framed!

Pumping Junior M.A.F.I.A., and B.I.G. getting money
I'm Hollywood swinging
It feels good sometimes so I zoned out and freak the funk and start singing

Bounce through the hood, she was moving on the block
Cause my peeps already blowing up the box
With the 411 on the party hot spot
Hit the rest shake the 9 to 5 stress
Till about 10 and it's time to get dressed
Gonna be a whole lot of woo-haa!
Know how we do on and on
Till the early morn
Always want to kick it not now I got move on
Beats pumping gotta get my groove on
Everybody's on the floor getting down
Players on the wild trying to spread the mack around
Red alert cause the bar's on fire
Serving drinks faster than you can blink an eye
Ain't gotta worry bout working next day

Shorties rolling deep looking right
Reminding me of the f I just swung her last night
Oh my god shining, talking on the phone
Check out baby in the beamer on the cell phone
Gotta put my thing down
Lock down the next round knock down for the next round
There's a run for the full-court press
Up and down bringing on the opposition stress
But it's all love this is how we do
Til the next Saturday keep it all true
Next stop speed down to the mall
Gotta get prop for the night the next player's ball
Same time different place
Parlay on Sunday for the weekend

In the V, lane three, switchin? up speed
I'ma be obnoxious until I can't breathe
And until then, y'all can't win

Luck's twelve on a scale from one to ten
Influenced by hydro and lots of gin
Nigga back up, damn I need oxygen
Surrounded by lots of men that'll rock your chin
And pop your limbs

How bout the gold Chevy, holdin? the four steady
Been runnin? war, let me know when whore's ready

Back to avenge his own death on this Earth

Down to the basement, the dog get it first

The voices in my head just won't leave me alone

Pissing on the car seats, flattening the wheels
So there's no escape from the fate that awaits
No one to witness the horror taking place

With hopes that the police soon will be here

It's the synical, lyrical rap individual
On my death bed I spit sick flows that's critical
I'm not a fan of this, I'm a mic vandalist
Thug therapist, my clan's too original
My slang bang to wax, words that's visual
Too digital for y'all common street criminals
Who want to come test, lick the sweat from my genitals
We can get off the mic and get a little physical
I was born to rock since they cut my umbilical
Cord, I swing swords, behold the prolifical
Rhyme writer, hip-hop provider, prize fighter
Live wire, quick to set the mic on fire
I speak legalized dope, hitman for hire
I quote murderous notes, dope rhyme supplier
Hang glide on the mic like a stunt driver
And I won't stop rockin till I retire

You woke up four gorillas wit a makeover
Packin a punch, asthma pump takeover
My crew boards, and the whole plane lays over
You can't talk wit the tape over
Pass the pussy, get out, date's over

I suggest, you wear a vest makin all them threats

Bricks, be shooting fair ones with bail bonds men
I'm constant, on that paper chase
Blow zip codes from bricks to 8-1-8

I empty niggas out like cristal bottles, uh

I got the heat right here, we ain't got to travel
I'm bigger than producers, I figured out you losers
I knew my longevity confuse ya
Big paper game, come on run into these flames
Recognize the power of the royal king james
Phantom menace, that's why niggas make faces like they drinking guinness
When they realize I'm not finished
I've been paid, I've been platinum, been spittin', uh
Been eatin', been ballin' and you know I'm shittin'
Platinum links, chinky-eyed blonde haired honeys sippin' rainbow colored drinks
Black thugs with white minks, ready to jack the brink
Bend your little wifee over help her stretch out the kinks

Made the choice to be seated until my mission's completed

What the world gonna do when my dogs get loose?

Four mc's with four reasons to bring this game to its knees
And why you down there, suck my dick
My whole motto is fuck it
Hit the smoke shop and blow my budget
Mc's abusing my bitch, using my shit
I'm hanging off the roof with one hand, losing my grip
Now y'all don't wanna see me do that, now do you?
Go straight cuckoo and terrorize rap, do you?
I do my best work stressed out and under pressure
Deep inside the mind is where you'll find my buried treasure

Still gritty style, foul, crimi-niminal, individual
Sing a song of sixpence
Pocket full of chits

You got it to bet? That's just how you got into debt
You lost when you nodded your neck
Through the vest, through the chest that you tried to protect
Take the voice that you try to project, check
Darin' you to kid, cat shootin' sperm in you wiz
I'm why you smell herb in the crib
Man I'm out for doubtful, shit I spit a mouthful
Indo out-do, intro to outro

I'm the hottest thing spittin' so go warn your clique
Them niggas y'all look up to is on my dick
Sauce motherfuckin' born to hit
I get so far up in your ass, think I was on some shit
Look, you against me is really nothin' to see
Who, when, where, what it's gon' be
I don't give a fuck if it's he or she
I'm the virgin of hip hop
Nobody fuckin' with me
I know your type, you a ride dick nigga
Cry sick nigga, lied quick nigga
Out of turn speakin', first one leakin'
Always the Suzuki side kick nigga
Bitches don't cast stones down, they throw bricks
Why I come through and tell 'em to blow dick
These nigga's the nicest?  No, go fish
Sauce, you da best motherfucker, no shit

You're treated and competed, walk away from it undefeated
Observe it from over there, ok 
Ain't It obvious we overheated
You talkin' that slick shit 
But I jus' know that you meant me 
But evidently, you don't know
I get your ass gone permanently
It ain't complex
I'll just bang holes or you're ablin' to ask who next
Do a drive-by on your project, take the traps
Come on and get some of our gun craps
I'll straighten out the nigga now
When I snap, make your chest cavity collapse
When I glide the entire map
With the frequent four alarm fire, rap straight up
Put weight down, fuck around, you ate up
And nigga when I eat, I mean I lick the whole plate up
Look in my eyes, I'm not scared
Sucka, you heard what I said
If you don't wanna get dead
No it ain't no cure, ice cold in the low, the go-rilla
The mo' scrilla the more real-la, I live to rule

Don't hold me back, you bet
How many nigga's think they fuckin' with mines
A nigga God blessed with such an undeniable shine
I hope you know there's nothin' fresher
The manifester apply the pressure
Tie you up and gag you in your mouth with a piece of polyester
Now fix your fuckin' face up
Empty the chest of drawers before I stretch your jaw
Everybody hit the fuckin' floor
Only the real mother fuckers belong
I hope nigga's don't end the party before we finish the song
(Bitch nigga)
You be the last to come and harrass, reflect on the past
When I used to pull spine outcho ass
Live nigga's go stack money, continue to bill shit
Long as I'm in this fucker I'm determined to kill shit
Zap nigga's like cellular flips and swell up your lips
Fuck with so much dick in their ass it's shrinkin' her hen house
Hey yo, before you empty your clip and pull at your trigger

Yeah fuck it I said it rub on ya titties
New York City gritty committee, pity the fool that act shitty
In the midst of the calm, the witty

Yo shut the fuck up!
Luck said shut the fuck up!
Bitches in the back, like crack get it cut up
I speak on behalf of them broads you call stuck up
Act like a man and get cocked, smacked or fucked up
Pull the truck up, Luck you know the name
Ass out in the bleachers stay shittin' on the game
I suppose what you're spittin' is flames, cowards
Knew your crew was vaginal, I could smell the dooch powder
Summer's Eve, I drop degrees chill
Come four by four, lose one like Dru Hill
Stay fly 'til you air sick, now that's ill
Two choices, either squeeze or peel, now that's real

What the fuck's goin' on here, just a minute now, hold up
Sinister wit hit the time I diminish him finish him, roll up
When I'm, in a, cinematography state of mind

Shit, I spectacular run hit spit bitches vernacular
Miraculous rhyme flow, back track to the Immaculate
Binaca blast nigga that's fast, son I'll out-box ya
Ladies rub the ta-ta's, bras, titties and knockers on the floor
Owww! Fellas pull ya cock out
On the verge to splurge verbs for third round knock out
Uh I bust a rhyme that dust frustrated rappers
Dust crush competition, lights out like the Clapper
The mic ripper, whip a nigga like a slave
Separate him from him from his fam, he don't know how to behave
Now, drag his ass, bag dun for his loot
Figure me to give a nigger-y twenty-one gun salute
That's seven shots for 2pac
Seven for Biggie Smalls
Seven for Freaky Tah up in your neighborhood malls
How's that, fat action packed rap remain tame

I spit out a bullet, load the barrel up
I kamikaze ya town off a Arab bus

Ya know my name, and Pharoahe Monch, why we came what?
We off the chain, plus we plottin' on the game, what?
Know ya role, by the way tuck ya gold
And you and your mic can ease on down the road
Assholes are like opinions, everybody got to have one
Shootin' in the sky tryin' to blast sun
Zero to sixty in a second, pull a fast one
Fifty cent flashin' they hate us with a passion
Mashin', still fresh in three-day old fashion
Your plaid, I'm stripes, together we be clashin'
Here's a Tunnel banger
Wu-Tang death penalty, the gas chamber
This gon' hurt me more than it hurts you
Slap ya like the doctor the day your momma birthed you
Just so you can feel me
The same way I'mma feel this world when it kill me
Even if time stands still, I'mma still be
Underground and filthy, gotta have our Way like the Milky
Innocent until I'm proven guilty
Never got caught in the game of tag
Momma never kept a boyfriend with kids this bad
No justice, raider ruckus
Underground 'til we under ground
But y'all first motherfuckers

My thugs, throw up ya set
And shorties rub on ya breasts
Get the fuck up, outta that dress, I palm tits
You herbs get flipped like jeeps on mountain cliffs
I'll rip through your chest, hollow-point talent tips
Double-S, double the threat, double your bet
Double up on that cash if you decide to invest
You sound like Big, you sound like Jay, you sound like D
And I bet, when I go plat, you'll sound like me
Shabaam Sahdeeq, injure your fleet into delete
Y'all crabs are weak, frail like a fiend's physique
I stay on the street, stay on the beat, stay with the heat
Stay stickin' fools like you for the rocks that gleam
So toss that link, dummy, shoulda insured that link
Straight to Canal I'll praise that link, then pawn that link
You froze up, Sahdeeq says shut the fuck up
Punk niggas get gun-butt up and tied up

Busta Rhymes is like Hacksaw Jim Duggan, been thuggin'
Lovin' the way we flood jewels for nothin'
Lay it over, another ambush we take over
Yo we don't only get money, we cut the coke and cook the shake over
You better guard your head right, especially if it's late at night
Or find your picture of your autoposy up on the web site
Yo if you ever violate my space
Fuck a fat lip, I'll leave you with a fuckin' fat face
Nigga, Busta Rhymes the handsome, I'll hold you for ransom and some
Like the ghost of a haunted house, I'll forever live in a mansion
Bitches, snitches comin' out and you know who's showin' it
Like when British civil servants pass secrets to the Soviets
Y'all niggas is seemless blends of seemless friends
Live on about the souls on a bunch of seamless ends
Collosal, me and my nigga Pharoahe Moncho
The head honcho, gettin' this money like Leonardo (Do-Do-Do-Do)
Enough substance in the roughness
Now watch it come around in an amazing large abundance
Now let me clear the smoke screen you blow fiend
Live nigga shit that'll rebuild your whole self-esteem
Pledge allegiance to the flag of united live niggas of America
Let us control and own the fuckin' area
Wildin' in your whip until you crash the whole truck up
And if you know what's good for you nigga you better get the fuck up!",Simon Says [Remix],1999

Ride wit me (Def Squad) 
Roll down your windows and ride wit me (uptown) 

Ride wit us 
Bitch ride wit us 
Ride wit us 
Roll up your windows and ride wit us 

Lets smoke this Oakland indoe 
Don't roll down the window 
Start the car 
We ain't going too far 

You know that big 'bootied' girl you always fuckin' wit 
She got a sister I really wanna get 
Some Georgia girls from college park 
You already fucked when we get that started off 

Park in the driveway, it won't take long 
Do it like that, it goes on and on 
You know this the kind of shit, I know you want
E made the beat let me show you somethin' 
Quite a few haters want to see us played out
 
But we got the formula to get payed now 
You can't stand in the way of success 
We got the same job but you make much less 
I remember how it used to be, before we had crack 
If you had a few hundred in your pocket that was fat

[Chorus]
If you feel like smokin' then ride wit us 
Hop the train with no token then ride wit us 
And if you don't give a fuck then ride wit us 
Roll down your windows and ride wit us 
And if you got five on it then ride wit us 
And if you ain't fake niggas then ride wit us 
And if your crew pull trigges then ride wit us 
Roll up your windows and ride wit us 

Ah-yo, I lick two shots that's heard all around the world 
Check how a forty and a blunt can take a nigga girl 
Like E.F. hunting, don't say nothin', I'm haunting 
On the microphone, its the eve of destruction
 
As the world goes around like Passion 
You get flattened in an orderly fashion 
You was warned like a coming attraction 
I got playa hated, felt liberated 
Put him on the burner cause the nigga violated 

We scamper like guard dogs through the fog 
If you feel like you wanna hop, leap like a frog 
The sergeant general get busy chief 
The fastest way to spell rhyme relief is Keith 

I leave you assed out like a cocaine drought 
Hey yo can I get a witness like Andre Krouch 
Niggas need to stop frontin' 
Bitches need to stop stuntin' 
Cause they know fuck well they can't stop my production 

[Chorus] 

I got the forty acres without the fuckin' mule 
Doc Ike Turner givin' mics audio abuse 
I smack a big mouth bitch, and her babysitter 
And her lesbian friend, and that nigga wit her
 
I don't give a fuck, I smack blood out a midget 
My tactics make evil D say come on kick it 
A black five wit rims, what you can spot me in 
Wanna die, I snatch you like Doc Kevorkian
 
So turn the beat up 
While NARCs got me on sweep up 
I'm lucky, I usually tote more Guns than Peter 
I fuck you up to where your forehead will cut meat up 
You wanna box, I square more than Matt Asenerina 
Backstabbing bitches and niggas eat a dick 
Cause you never heard the Doc do (nothin' like this) 
Backstabbing bitches and niggas eat a dick 
Cause you never heard the Doc do (nothin' like this0

From the wilderness of time
To the land of new beginning
Starting with a new design
Never doubted for a second
That I'd do it on my own
And I held onto my corner
Trusted in the things I know 

You will never feel
How good it is to love me
Rather than control me
I don't need the world weighing down my shoulders
But that's all over here I am

I made it back
From a place called nowhere
I made it back
To do this once again
I made it back
From a place called nowhere
I made it back
Once again I made it back
 
Got a chance to fix up neatly
Set it off and not too late
Saw the light and walked towards it
I'm the master of my late
Coming up just wasn't easy
It took all the strength I had
Now I'm ready for the action
Mamma got a brand nu bag

You will never feel
How good it is to love me
Rather than control me
I don't need the world weighing down my shoulders

At gunpoint, stripped and thrown out the car?

My style dirty underground, or Ukraine po'
When it hits you, pain pumps cool-aid, through the vein and shit
Snatch the trap then I dash like Damon did
Doc, walk thin red lines to shell shock
Hair lock with fucking broads in nail shops
Hydro? got more bags than bellhops
Two thousand Benz on my eight by ten picture
Papichu', slaying gcrews in icu
Battling, using hockey rules

With ten kids with hammers, hooked to a camper!

Youth on the move, paying them dues, nothing to lose
Huh, street kids, broken and bruised, eyeing yo' jewels
Huh, bad news, baring they souls through rhyming blues
Hardcore! to make them brothers act fool
Hands on the steel, flip you heads over heel 
Smell the daffodils from the lyric overkill 
Feeling like the mack inside a Cadillac Seville 
Too ill, on cuts, the barber of Seville, fi-ga-ro!
The sky is falling, Geronimo!
I feel my high coming down, lookout below!
Hey yo! dead that roach clip and spark another
Chicken hawks, playing they selves like Parker brothers
I rock for the low-class, from locash
The broke-assed, even rock for trailer park trash
Yeah yeah, the god on your block like Godzilla
Yeah yeah, she gave away my pussy I'ma kill her
John john phenom-enon, in japan they call me ichiban
Wu-tang clan, number won!

Redman,"Yeah, State vs. Kirk Jones, Judge Battle now residing 
Got a case of armed robbery that ended up in violence 
Maximum sentence, life in jail's what you're facin' 
Prosecution set it with your opening statement

Your honor, before we get started
I'd like to give my condolences to the family of the dearly departed 
Tyrone survived by his mother Barbara
His two year old daughter T'want to 
And the baby's mamma Sandra 
[He's a murderer! That animal killed my baby's father!]

Order in the court!

I'm sorry for the outburst your honor 
I have an original copy of the police report 
January the 4th the day that Kirk Jones got caught
The forensic report states there was a gun in the car 
And gunpowder residue on Mr. Jones' right arm 
Baliff, could you please pass this report to Judge Battle 
Mr. Fitzpatrick there's a few questions I'd like to ask you 
You said you was outside the store in Manhattan 
So could you please tell this court what you saw happened 

Yeah he killed Tyrone 
I saw everything, the argument, how son drawed, hose and everything 
The worst shit I saw in my life 
I want to testify I swear before God it was Kirk Jones, no lie 

Did you see that man in court today?
Do you think that you could point him out?

Yes that's him right there 

Are you sure?

Yeah without a doubt 
Same nigga that took my Pumas but I ain't hold no grudge 
Remembered his foul ass when I saw the blood 

You stated you had a run in with Kirk Jones before 
In your opinion is he the type that would rob a jewelry store?

Your honor, objection!
His opinion should be stricken from the record!

Objection sustained, prosecution next question 

I'd like to call my next eyewitness Mr. Paul Dejour 
Paul could tell us what happened inside the store?
(Scarred for life)
Yeah, it was about 20 past, I saw the S class 
Pull up in the reflection in the mirror in the store glass 
And quicker that you could say, nigga kiss my ass 
He hopped out of the passenger side wit a black ski mask 
I saw somebody run up in the store and order us on the floor 
Yo I swore I was a goner for sure 
He tried to snatch Tyrone's bracelet 
It just appraised to the twenty grand and Tyrone wouldn't let him take it 

Is that the moment when he shot him?
(Scarred for life)
Yeah man that's when he popped him 
I was so scared I laid there, played possum 
He started to blast this way, 'til the gat was empty 
He took the gun handle and broke the glass display 
He emptied all of the trays and ran out the store
And I watched Tyrone bleed to death on the floor 
I can't remember no more, that's all that... 

Okay, okay calm down 
I have no further questions your honor 

Court is now in session, now gettin' back to business 
Pat Haley for defense please call your first witness 

Yeah aight your honor, I call up Henry Lace
He's the witness that I'm cross examinin' for the case 

Yeah I testify your honor, it was death by dishonor 
It was a crime committed, I swear to you I know who did it 
It happened so fast, I didn't see a lot of it 
But I know for a fact he stuck a gun to his esophagus 

Wait, wait, wait objection your honor, his statement's preposterous 
There was no weapons found, no sign of no hostages 
Remember Mr. Henry Lace you under oath [yeah I know]
You lyin' in the stand to get him fryin' in the pan 
Now where was you the night you claim he shot Tyrone 
You and holmes had beef before Kirk got home 
Was you mad because he came home bangin' your chick [what you talkin' 'bout?]
Got your boys out the hood now they slangin' and shit 
I know you mad that's why you in court, turnin' on him 
Kirk cold blooded killer wit no burner on him 
Come on you don't believe he murdered Tyrone 
I believe you wasn't there you just heard it by phone 

Man you crazy man I was right there... (Yeah right... I read your rapsheet...
calm down, calm down, chill, chill, Kirk, Kirk...) 

No he wasn't! He's lyin! Fuck you you liar!
Man fuck that he's lyin he wasn't even there man!
(He killed Tyrone man! Fuck that!) No I didn't! 
Man he's lyin' man! He's lyin' 

Order in the court now I'm warning you defense 
Tell your client take it down, matter fact 'proach the bench 
Counsel in my chambers so that we can situate 
Let the jury be excused so they can go deliberate...

Yo man, Mr. Haley what kind of defense is this man!
What you doin' man?! She gon' fuckin' hang me man!
No! Sh-she's got it in for me I'm tellin' you man!
You promised you'd get me off man!

In the case of the State vs. Kirk Jones you heard it 
Both sides testified and the jury reached a verdict 
Guilty! All counts from theft to murder one 
(Huh? Wha-wha-what?! Guilty?!] 
By the time you gettin' out you gon' have a grandson 

Fuck you bitch I'll see you in hell bitch!
Fuck that!! Fuck that!! Fuck, get off me! Fuck you Pat Haley!!
(What?! Get him out of my courtroom!!)
Fuck the judge, fuck everybody!! 
(Baliff, baliff remove him from my courtroom...)
Fuck this shit!! I hope you all burn in hell!!!
You're gonna die bitch!! Fuck you!!!

See my boys down the ride crack patience too 
Bricks, walk around, snorkel down 
Macaroni and cheese Timbs broke out the orphan house 
Transporting out, the poison in 'em 
Box 'em up in the aisle with the frozen dinners 

And them niggas that ran

My goal's to get 'em 
With the heat seeking flow with, four antennas 
Doc's the Name, that's why why y'all fuck wit me

You know my name, so there's no need for introduction 
I'm Mr. Done it all, so none of why y'all can do me nothing

In headlocks, from this view, I'm fuckin' Star Jones 
I'm red hot just like candy, in '95 won the Grammy 

Yo, he use it as an ashtray now

Still pulling out pennies, Fuhgidabowdit 

The shit I see every day brings tears to my eyes 
How I holla at my niggas brings ears to my cries 
Stick niggas for not knowing, then teach 'em something 
Bitch niggas talking bout you from the streets you fronting 
I never liked you, and you, I don't know 
So what the fuck you think is 'sposed to happen, we goin' go 
Mano a mano, whatever nigga, I'm goin' dust you 
If you can't pick that afro, I'm goin' bust you 
Walking like you was a lil nigga 'cause you is 
And don't forget that daddy's gonna always love his kids 
Cracking niggas got the nerve to wonder why I rob, why 
You guys will live while everybody else'll starve 
That pretty shit is played, fuck what your name hold 
Break a nigga off something, watch a nigga gain fo' 
Now you laying somewhere cold, stiff as shit 
And all that riffing shit, men's will get you hit, bitch

Causing terror to christina aguilera
When i grab her by the hair and drag her across the sahara
Beware of this rap terrorist with a therapist
With a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled in his pants
Got a habit of holding tylenol in his hands
Til it melts in his fuckin' palms and dissolves in his glands
[so who is it?] the fool who visit the playground
Wit' two biscuits to lay down the school district
Get pistol whipped wit a mauseburg

Die and live for my nigs and my bad ass kids
Freeze [sniff], lookin at your ice like PLEASE
Plottin on the mouse trap, about to snatch the cheese
I heard y'all kids is 'bout that, psycho therapy
Fuckin, where the cow chat? Blue till they bury me
Never tell a lie, like George with the cherry tree
Now it's cherry pie, if it's not BROKE, let it be
Ain't nuttin nice in, New York, stick ya for ya cake and ya icin
All that tough talk don't mean nuttin when ya up north
So keep them hands where I can see them like ya want freedom
You know that sayin, if ya can't join 'em
Beat 'em and push ya way in
We ain't acrobats but we flip on occasion
Pick the Pace up, past snaggin, throw your waist up

Frontin on my Clan from Shao', we ain't mad at you

Droopy luck, my main bitches call me lazy
Educated birds say, ""Ghost, you're so crazy""

Cappa slide through with the Ghost
Post up like paint on walls
Drip jew-els, big heat ruffle inside the bubble-goose
It's the odd couple, holo-points follow you home in Staten Island
Playin with the big toys that make noise
Echo in the hall, a scared voice
Niggas start to act choice, but Dunkin 'hinds
Didn't know Betty Crocker had them two nines
Made the club moist, shattered the windows
Dust heads runnin, the black kingpin buzz the Black Jesus

Yo, the words you talk better be the words you walk
Body you in the van while the nurse is off
Put your vein out, watch me insert the dart
Till it bleeds from Bricks to the Persian Gulf
Light curcuits off, thirty-third if my brain is off
That explains why my language off
My gun aim and cough, y'all ain't trained to brawl
Y'all more like them training bras
Wet behind the ear, you're not prepared
For the project flow, with extra stares
I pass out a vest to wear (bullets'll fly)
Yo, a hard wire, startin bonfires
Pullin mask, so you know it's me
Your weave got more seeds than ODB
Can't smoke wit'cha, watch Ghost tie rope to ya

Don't get caught up in my chains or the way that I speak""

Check out the greys on the side of my waves, my crew doze on Riker's Island
Stretched out, malled up in the cage
Pull a ? out on Jimmy Jam, shakes Space Jam
Silky texture, Jordan jumped up like Clyde Drexler
All up in the parrot, nose numb, real as they come

Hands is like photographic magic
Funeral love, boohoo when we hug, don't make it a habit
Hit the gym in two weeks, my back all chisseled
Elbows unique now, meet the new me
Ghetto fabulous, Tony Atlas

And has killed six fine law enforcement agents in the line of duty
For the vicious acts
She should be punished to the fullest extent of the law

Pardon me your honor
May I address the bench?
They try-na assassinate me like they did to Larry Flynt
* Coughs
Excuse my persona
I may be hardcore but I'm not Jeffrey Dalmer
Ever since I killed ?em
I ain't been in trouble since
It wasn't my fault I acted out of self-defense
He killed my best friend
(Who's him?)
I mean them
They was all dressed in blue and they want me dead too
They had real grenade bombs inside of their palms
And a whole bunch of guns wrapped tight in their arms
See them bastards woke me up when they broke my alarm
I was getting my ass licked by this cat named Tom
(Stop!)
I heard three guns cocked that's when Tom dropped
They sent the bow and arrow right through his tank top

Lying? Blood was gushing on the floor

They ran up in your spot and no one gave the orders

Soon as I cop the nine, I pop the nine 
When I take it out the box, I represent Lox 
Now when I flow, you hit the rewind button 
So I charge out more, want it all at the door 
Fuck heat, Sheek walk around with an oven 
Who you gonna kill with that little Foreman grill? 
How its gon' look when I come through your block? 
Sheek, Funk Doc, Meth on top 
Porsche, 300 horse fly by, back open pumpin How High (How High) 
Yeah, can y'all see that (See that) 
Bitch you can call me what you want, 'cause I'll Be Dat (Be Dat) 
Get off my dick, I don't care about no jewels

A five speed clutch on my paw when I ride 
I glow like the pegs in Lite-Brite 
3000 bolts of lightening when fly the right kite 
Me and Meth be hennesey, two ice cubes 
We can draw (Choose your weapons) or do I choose? 
When I choose the grip, one shot lose your hip 
I hope your shoes fit for this move and pick 
My avalanche it came with, ten feet of snow 
I'm cold blooded, my fam half eskimo 
My flows move like endo 
Turn ten nickels into ten loads, outta ten stoves 
Ride the crash course, do the math on it 
Swizz Beats you can ride Amtrak on it 
But I'm on it, grillin with George Foreman 
Ya peeps is at the Grammy awards cornin 
The ice, the fat wallet son, I won it 
In the helicopter, warmin before morning 
Def Jam nigga, Redman nigga, Doc 
Fuck ya momma on my sweat band nigga 
You tough guys will get smacked in the club 
With the gun I bought from Mack in the club 
Its P-P-P from Bricks to Brook-nam (Come on) 
Bring me some more ass to whoop on

Look what the cat dragged in 
Underground dweller from the cellar bring terror 
Scoop of high yellow cinderella, Meth forever 
Never rush a rhyme, hook could never bust my nine 
But if I have to, I have to, its all in the mind 
I stay ahead of time while y'all fallin behind 
Tryin to relight ya lime, its a crime when I drop ??? design 
That tick it, tick boom, blow your mind 
Yeah me, M-E-T, H, the O, the D 
Can't be done like tryin to find a penny in the sea 
Nigga run for cover son go and get them guns 
Y'all ain't from here, don't try to come around and gettin ones

Pull my ?dart gun? and bust sixteen until its dead

To carry it I take the spare out the trunk
I stay hungry, I ain't worked for days

We roll longer than dice in a casino
Cee-lo in the 4, 5 or 6 with double 0
Behind the tinted windows I lay low
On some hydro tryin' to slide from the 5-0
But now I get wild similar to Ol' Dirty
A third time felon just hit with over 30
No worries, style have em so thirsty
First degree heats are quittin' on me, cold turkey, no mercy
I bring the pain of a hundred migraines
But a thousand shoutin' my name that's why I came
But first bring the cashburst, then the outburst
My surround sound pound ya ear like Jevon Kearse

I was born in Oklahoma
Quarter Cherokee I'm told
Don't remember Oklahoma
Been so long since I left home
Seems like I've always been in prison
Like I've always been alone
Didn't mean to hurt nobody
Never thought I'd cross that line
I held up a filling station
Like I'd done a hundred times
The kid done like I told him
He lay face down on the floor
Guess I'll never know what made me
Turn and walk back through that door
The shot rang out like thunder
My ears rang like a bell
No one came runnin'
So I called the cops myself
Took their time to get there
And I guess I could'a run
I knew I should be feeling something
But I never shed tear one
I didn't even make the papers
'Cause I only killed one man
But my trial was over quickly
And then the long hard wait began
Court appointed lawyer
Couldn't look me in the eye
He just stood up and closed his briefcase
When they sentenced me to die
Now my waitin's over
As the final hour drags by
I ain't about to tell you
That I don't deserve to die
But there's twenty-seven men here
Mostly black, brown and poor
Most of em are guilty
Who are you to say for sure?

And they shave off all my hair

First of all you get a fat bag of ism 
From uptown, any local store sells the shit friend 
Purchase a philly, not the city of Philly 
Silly punk, I'm talking 'bout the shit called the Philly blunt 
Lick the blunt and then the Philly blunt middle you split 
Don't have a razor blade, use ya fuckin fingertips 
Crack the bag and then you pour the whole bag in 
Spread the ism around until the ism reach each end 
Take your finger and your thumb from tip to tip 
Roll it in a motion then the top piece you lick 
Seal it, dry it wit ya lighter if ya gotta

'Cause his breath has the dragon in the dungeon 
I would if this shit would stop drippin' wit saliva 
And if you gonna lick it, don't drown it with ya spit, shit 
I dunno what dick or last puss you licked quick 
And how 'bout the non-blunt rollin' females 
That always fucks it up 'cause they don't want to break their Lee nails

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get

Mista Method Man, puttin' in work, foot in the dirt
Like it's all good, roll through your hood, pushin' a hearse
I wish y'all would come around like Clint Eastwood
As if you're reppin' your hood in my neck of the woods
Peep the villians in the PJ's, grimy bitch
I wear the same shit for three days, find me lit
Blunt sparks, like Felipe, fuck the he-say, the she-say
Adjust the microphone, plus the cliché

Yo, call me the Bob Backlund
I'll break backs on hoes that look like Toni Braxton
Come run with these boney masked men
I'm out the gutter, I'm out to send your baby mother
Out for rubbers, we fuckin' tonight
Bitches wanna crowd around, how I'm cuffin' the mic
I'm a gorilla, leave a banana stuck in your pipe
‘Cause I'm a real block winner, when Doc enta
Bitch, one of my balls bigger than the Epcot Center!

About to blow his lid from the pressure, too hot for TV
For sheesy, too many wanna be hard be easy

Mad at you, where I used to battle crews
Back when Antoinette had that attitude

Got us bustin' off these pistols

Armed with the mega bomb
Blow you out the frame and then I'm gone

Leave you in a blue lagoon lost (true)
Three nines in the glove with Masu, D-Don in the club
Right behind on a bus
Haters don't touch (what?) weigh us both up

Got the cable hooked up, all channels
Lift my shirt all mammal
You ship off keys and we ship Grand Pianos
Sawed off shotgun
Hand on the pump, sippin' on a forty

Bust my gun y'all

Took the ring, pawned it for an Acura

Bitches fuck me barely walkin out
For a thievin ass hoe (?) mark it out
It's one mo' body in the hall for now
Verbal assault killer, calm him down
I open fire, made you retire
Hung your shoes from a telephone wire
So when I ride by, I brag on it
Paragraphs flower, toe tags on it
I plant a bomb where you pick your mail up

It's bone-afficial my nizzle
D-Don got issues, and a type team that dismiss you
Oh boy! I gets more +Chips+ than +Ahoy!+
I got toys that deploy, I just aim and destroy
I keeps it gully in a bonafide skully
I ain't never had a hit but still get props like Nelly
I'm platinum in streets I got, love in the streets
And I'm more underground than your, basement concrete
Braids in my hair, gold still in my teeth
Still, bringin the beef if you're, bringin me grief
I, rat-a-tat-tat it like one-two one-two
Cock my shit back and let off on your whole crew
I'm Brick City baby twenty-fo'/seven
A project nigga that's, tryin to see heaven
I done ran through hell with gasoline drawers on (AOWW!)
I'm the portrait of a hustler, and once again it's on
I still got money buried in my back yard
I'm Bumpy like Johnson, they call me D-Don
My shit's so dope when you smoke you nod
And I spit that shit that leave you holy like the song

[Pacewon]
Yo.. we from the place where they pump out D and steal cars
Kids wild wave at you and smile you feel large
like they cut, and you got the power to heal scars
Never down cause the underground crown is still large
See I rap for a livin, probably rap 'til I die
If you dope, where you been at? Your raps is a lie
I'm all real, the one, the raw deal
Do tour, come home, do a flick for four mill'
What the hardcore heads on the block would call ill
Never catch me at the ball-out spot with small bills
Innovative rapper, rhyme in new ways
When I spit niggaz cough up blood for two days
Never catch me with material girls, they fugaz'
Rather bounce with a short chickenhead in blue shades
'Til the day I'm rich like Bruce Wayne
I'ma kick raps like pimps blew game
Ridin through your block with six new chains on
Pullin over droppin H-bombs
No doubt I got it locked Sanford Ave. to Penn Station
Chancellor to Central a thousand men waitin

[Chorus - 2X w/ minor variations]

You heard me light the Dutch (smokin weed)
Rock on like what the fuck (what the fuck?)

[Roz]
Fuckin with me is a close call out of my crew
Don't try it I fuckin roast why'all, you and your co-stars
Next up to bat, I done had enough of cats
Blast tracks like what the fuck was that?
Roz spit rawness
State to state, hood streets and block corners
Rhymes hold so much weight, the feds on us
Lot of niggaz didn't want to see me last
But I won't stop just slow down like Easy Pass
Back up and give the are room
Or we gon' brawl worse than cartoons in bar rooms
In my city they don't pop they collar
Cats that do, get shot drop and holla
I'm from the be	-are-I, see-K-S
And my, squad is hot, any beef they bless
Any, squad that test gon' meet they death
Ask yourself, do you really need that stress?

[Shooga Bear]
Aiyyo, I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door, no bitin allowed
Plus the blows that I throw bring a light in the sound
So whoever want the drama I'm invitin them now
Phenomenal shit, spit 'til my abdominal split
Plus combined lines so minds demolish a click
Still burn MC's like Everclear, never fear
With razor sharp skills so ill they, sever ears
Hard to the roots a hundred proof with no chaser
Scarves and some boots a hundred troops with chrome bangers
Now rock with me, I spray blocks with glock fifties
Still when I spit I flip like Spock sent me
And never gave a fuck what a rapper grossed
But if they, brag and boast I'ma clap the toast
why'all can analyze this, watch me paralyze clicks
And sabotage why'all, I ain't a fan of why'all shit

I'm a nasty ass disease, and now I got ya mouth celibate
I'm a direct descendant of Hannibal's elephants

It's Double O again, still runnin, still gunnin
It's like I got a cast-iron dick, I'm still cummin
Talkin that killer shit like you blood raw
And ain't even did ten minutes in the back of a squad car
Be big niggaz to they weak, I'm true to the streets
why'all niggaz is half-assed like one booty cheek
I'm (??), why'all is Swiss Miss
My camp'll make your army pull back like a slipped disc
It be the Bricks again, with me with them steel rods
It ain't right unless Shane, Tariq, and Raouf Nayim is involved
I did ery'thang from robberies to dope
And why'all just lie about it, like it's a big-ass joke
Playin like kids, I think you want me to spank you
Ninety-nine on the charts with a ship anchor on your ankle
And if you niggaz don't like what I say
I'm in Newark on Market and Hasley e'ry fuckin day

It's da bullshit, bullshit, yo where the weed at fellas, what you lightin'

Yo, yo, you motherfuckers gon' learn
When it come to this shit, I ain't about takin' turns
'Cause Doc's in the place, the cold nigga, I'm too late to thaw
Doc unfold niggas 'til they ribs is raw

Whether you up the ball or ride the bitch
My pens write with a vengeance and Viagra in
Stay hard like the biceps when it's stacked
I'm gritty, I wouldn't love in a tennis match

I don't like to sign autographs half the time
I scribble my name and draw a jackass design
Calvin Kleins spilled on the floor, you just got
Dogged on the tour, so, send some new whores, H O

I got a food table to warm, a new neighbor to warn
And people at the label I'm on
Crunch time, what you think the forty-four is for
When I grub, I want the whole smorgas board

Gotta clean my act up and, get my thoughts straight
Stop smashin' the five and appear in the court dates
I won't ride the bike unless it's C B R
With no tricks but a bitch it'll be on next

I'm still wheel handlin, you die in a ambulance
Block prime scramblin', glock nine handlin'
Duckin' the flows of mind travelin'
You heard it before, you ain't Sunshine Anderson

Got a bomb plantin' and I'm ready for more
Bitches gettin' in my party givin' head at the do
All my niggas and my shorty's and get high in the audience
I carry a gaudy gun, you'll die in the audience

That's the bullshit, the bullshit
We walk up in the club we on the bullshit
That's the bullshit, the bullshit
Fondling your bitch ass off the bullshit

That's the bullshit, the bullshit
Brick City, Brook-non off the bullshit
That's the bullshit, that's the bullshit
That's the- nah, nah, nah, nah, chill nigga
That's the bullshit

Yo, I put the pressure on a man without a gun in my hand
His limpin' lenny turn around and then I pump from the pants
One nine in each arm, I get hot as I squeeze from it
Now he's a cheap ornament, died in a street tournament

Peep the clues, not deep with dudes
My Benz don't carry shoes 'cause I'm cheap as Jews
But I let off this cannon bet your fleet would move
After that I tell you and what the beat to do

Fuck the Visine, duck when I lean out the window
With a shottie with me and myself and Irene and my team
Fuck your mainstream dry off feet
I'm explosive as Simon in Die Hard 3

Now you wavin' six flags like you at GA
'Cause my gun on standby like a flight delay
Sprayin' water on all those whoever's hot
Take they mic, take they jewels, then them Bezell, Doc

Stop IC-Don, get gone, nigga I'm here
Sippin' a beer, 5th with the clip in the rear
That'll lift him off his feet, make him flip in the air
I pull big guns out, like I'm hittin' a deer

You don't really know when trouble come
When you open your door and somebody
In yo, house chewin' bubble gum
With double guns, cocked in each hand
Nigga, you about to be buried in beach sand

I don't care if you broke or not
I don't care if you sell weed, dope, coke or not
Nigga, I still smoke the glock
Give your face polka dots, y'all better hope I stop

Man doom, I kidnap a classroom
Hide 'em in the left wing of my bathroom
Do you think you could survive all that we bring, ya
Bullets, comin' at ya just as long as your finger

And every, morning I linger on the corner just drinkin'
Borin' and thinkin', how I'm 'bout to score with this ink pen
You better hope we blow on this rappin' shit
You don't want us to go under the mattresses

Shorty lookin' at me funny like I don't get bank
My house is hot bitch, I swim in my fish tank
Every car got a bar, the whole clique drink
I'm a dirty nigga, nuts sweaty, dick stink

After we fuck, I'm takin' you to S and D's
That's a lie bitch I am on ecstasy
I won't remember none of this when the X in me
So if you want sex for free, check for me, IC-Don

Like, when daddy's home can't nobody beat the kids
Right? You know the clan and you know the fuckin' man
Meth rock a mic without a kickstand
Two blunts, and razors in his wristband
Slap you and your bitch man
Lookin' in your lobby, call me stick-man
When it's goin' down, call me quicksand
Zero to sixty in a second, pack a Smith & Weston
And if the price is right, you can be the next contestant
For this aggression, no question, M-E to the F it be flexin'
As hard as my erection, kid learn your lesson
'cause what if I decide to start testin' the joint in the muthafuckin session?

Let a nigga get into it
Lubricate why'all veins with your ""Do-It"" fluid
I Einstein these rymes, spit these thangs to prove it
Cross with the mac, in fact my games are truest
Now I'm on the highway, doing it my way
With Street the legal, Meth, Roc, and Doc friday
Performin' like the weather was warm
And drop heat on the streets through zero degree storms
And keep the ghetto, pop your metal
Smoke it like a cigarette till ya optic yellow
The addiction, ain't no friction
I got them rap heads fillin' out a prescription
With diciton, they in thick, when I put fire to the stakes
And burn the arch, like a iron to your face

Not with a mic, I brrrrrrrrrrrr, tuck it in

All you motherfuckers out there that want to get down with the pound
put your motherfuckin' pounds up, and start bustin' the motherfuckers
Am I too loud for this motherfucker? Turn me down a little bit
Yeah yeah yeah

Yo, first of all I'm a grown-ass man, pay my own bills
Stated own real, haters gon' feel
Direct Syndrome, mouth with cold tongue
You bounty hunters be on the chase for Joe Young
I won't slip, keep pink slips to my car
I'm raw like sushi bars on bougie broads
I retrieve the money, dawg labrador
Ray Charles can see it, and Stacy Lattisaw
You get mashed out, cause your bird is peckin'
Don't be the next vinyl cut to Urban Legend
I can feel where you at, when I pound you up
You out of town coke rhymes, oh you clowns is up
My crew stay in the truck, can't fit in the Porsche
If you bitches ain't happy, then get a divorce
I'ma do what I want, cause my time is now
Grab the whole rap game, and divide it down

If I want to roll a Jeep with a seat out the back
Bitch feet out the back, system beat out the track
Am I wrong for dat? (If that's what you like)
Dawg, am I wrong for dat? (Hey, I guess not)
Yo yo, if I walk into the club with my hand on my snub
Beatin down security cause I don't give a fuck
Am I wrong for dat? (Mmm mmm)
Dawg, am I wrong for dat? (Say what)

I copped the whole box, went half with Reginald
Hollow tips infrareds and clips came free
And you ain't gotta believe me, fuck bein' nervous
Far as I'm concerned they're at your funeral service
What do we have here? Snitch in despair, shoot off his ear
Have his whole body shakin' in fear
Stormtrooper fires throwin' lashin' out flames
A few ashes, when they analyze your remains
I live in the streets, reside with the toolie
I kill you like it's part of my religious duty
Street sweeper thug keeper sweepin' thugs under the rug
Even females who think they thugs
Trigger the release of adrenaline
When I'm gangsta-trippin' like the Bloods'n'Crips'n'them
Unleash the matter of energy, killin' 'em
Why'd you do it? Because I wasn't feelin' them!

If I ride through the hood, smokin' a ounce of haze (uh-huh)
with a shabby haircut, pants I wore for days
Am I wrong for dat? (I don't think so)
C'mon bitch, am I wrong for dat? (Say what)
Yo, if I want a fat chick that keep her toes done (uh-huh)
When they playin' my song ass spill out the thong
Am I wrong for dat? (Got that big ass)
Am I wrong for dat? (Tchk, no)

I gotta, bang the boogie to that bang bang pussy
To that bang to the pussy the beat, beat

Gave him what he wanted plus the extra large fry

But I heard f***in' all the way from the bottom
I'm like, damn she yellin' kinda made me jealous
Knocked on the door enraged
Like a broke-a** rapper, at a label that ain't toured in days

Do it clown, before I count to four now
'Cause if I hit five them flares'll blow your door down
I heard the zipper zip up, and they was tryin' to run
So I re-clipped the clip up, and blew it before one

Freeze motherf***ers, I jumped on Jane back
I want the cheese motherf***ers and my name back
We tusslin', fightin', bitin' skin and rustlin'

By the spare, she hungry I'll feed her fries
Cause I'ma, dog nigga, shot-call nigga
My shotgun talk with a lecture hall scripture
Applaud  bitch, shake that ass
I getcha, drunk and high and duct tape that ass fast
Then leave you on your daddy front lawn (ding dong)
With your hair all fucked up, with one pump on
Get stomped on, I take the money and run
I'm a dog, shit I fuck right in front of your son
If you ain't got Missy and Meth
Want me to spit the hot shit for you? Nigga, write your check

[Missy]
When you come home from work, I'm gon' make you do more work
Pour some wine in the cup, sip sippin on sizz-urp
Oh oh now we gon' make love to and in ya

When you with me oh so right, tell them boys not tonight
Say you chilling witcho bitch and this is one why'don't want to miss

Yo yo I want to gangsta boogie with my gangsta bitch!
Love it when the pussy talk back thanks to dick
All my dogs (woof) playing the wall, get at these broads
You ain't got no-ass-at'all, we ain't fucking wit y'all
I'm not your smooth lovin, see me at Casbah thuggin
Hands where your Stove Top be stuffing
Never catch Tical hand-cuffin, I'm in your party puffin
Smelling like that Wu-Tang production
Cousin tried to tell me pussy come a dime a dozen
And when it come around I'll beat it down like percussion
Missy come and get me, I'm bout to call Doc
We can all meet up at Peanut's, I heard it was the spot
Somebody roll the weed up, push the car lighter, kick your feet up
Saturday Night, who got the Fever?
Brought the flavor, of Indonesia
Puff puff give type procedures
And this joint bumping out your speakers

[Chorus]

[Missy]
I'm gonna take you high to the top
And let your body not reject me babe
I'm gonna make you really love me
I'm gonna make you scream don't stop

Redman,"Yo, now when you hear the name Keith Murray, don't think violence
That's nonsense, me and Meth put that to silence
I'm a product of the streets, master of the breaks and beats
Lyrically headstrong and can't be beat

Triple minded, mentally combineded underground pirate
Microphone tyrant, always comin' sideways
And Topsy turvy, lyrical crash-up derby
Come, Filthy McNasty, pretty gritty dirty

Lyrical sayin' MC slayin', 'Hip Hop Quotable'
Unquotable, sociable thirty-eight caliber style swayin'
Open your mind to visualize what I'm sayin'
The products of the streets don't be playin'

It's a bloody ambush like a dirty douche in ya tush
When I push, push up in ya bush
Superstar status, break off beats, the baddest
Style's the baddest, bring extra clips to stop the madness

Yo, we in the place
(Now whut's up?)
DJ, pick up the pace
(Now whut's up?)
Gyrate, feel the bass
(Now whut's up?)
What the deal, huh?
(Now whut's up?)

Aiyyo we ain't playin' fair no more, there's somethin' new in store
A Hot Boy but not from the 504
New technique to rock the mic
Lyrical 'Blade' sharp like Wesley and N'Bushe Wright

Soundbombin' could be a catastrophe
When NASA blast off, Flex blast off me
E-vincible, rap round your left ventricle
So let's be sensible

E temperamental, quick to dismember you
Wyclef that 'November' you
They wish they can do what I can do
If you could switch brains, you would, wouldn't you?

My style is Mike, Vince, Earvin
Jordan, Carter, Julius, servin'
MC's at will, I'm trickery, Lou ain't stickin' me
A curve ball, Mark ain't hittin' me

Yo, we in the place
(Now whut's up?)
DJ, pick up the pace
(Now whut's up?)
Gyrate, feel the bass
(Now whut's up?)
Yo, what the deal, huh?
(Now whut's up?)

Yo, rapid gunfire destroy ya boys and unemploy some
Put the headphones on your kid like Castor Troy's son
Darts'll damage ya dogs where the you-Haul in my truck
The camera installed, hand upon my balls

Call the morgue, I'm killin' 'em, even Kyle is not feelin' 'em
When I drill 'em with skills of ten Eminems
You feminine, don't even call my name
I stay locked down walkin' with a ball and chain

Put the mac where you tongue at, I done that
These young cats'll get thumbtacked and sent where Big Pun at
Smoke so much, the doc asked where my lung at
I took it out to stash my gun, son run that

Pop mega shit, I pop mega clips
Fuck a system, I keep the heat where your Sega sit
Then I bang the controller 'til the game say, ""Over""
In the Bricks, we'll stick ya when ya plane lays over

Yo, we in the place
(Now whut's up?)
DJ, pick up the pace
(Now whut's up?)
Gyrate, feel the bass
(Now whut's up?)
What the deal, huh?
(Now whut's up?)

Yo, y'all know me, maniacs and addicts add it, at it
Venomous addict snake biter, I the, at it
'Cause I'm a little odder at it
In the Ac' with the aircraft and then leave inactive

My alter-ego make niggaz alter their egos
I flow and turn the East coast to one big creep show
South premisy, Filthy-delphia pistol bangers
Pistol changin', pistol bangin'

I lift metal like Lithuanians
Two thousand nail me Sy Scott rap's new insanian
It's humane, punish ya mayn
'Til no skeletal remains remain remain mainly main

To bitten man made disease that's made by man
Crackin' the DNA code to see how God made man
I storm the mainland, scare MC's like slave hands
Put microchips in they wristbands and make 'em rain dance

Lay hands like Mike Strahand
Puttin' ya face and hands in Ace bands
Tryin' to lift more than ya waistband

I travel every shinin' sea, sea and land to finally see
When niggaz land in the error era wherever, forever no error
Easily cut niggaz careers down like ever
Ever forever and ever, don't you ever
Fuck with Sy, Khi and Erick when we come together, what?

A dog on four paws spittin' out the window
Jump up! It aint no need to fight
We may squeeze the pipe, you gonna bleed tonight
I eat beans and rice, shit up a storm
I walk the streets with shark fin off my arms
Doctor Dolittle, lit off the bone
My bracelet like I raised it off the farm
Home-grown, thick, dirty
My family feud dudes who pack 2's on survey
Jersey and house
Gun like an elephants snout
Pull ya ambulance out
Ya whole team'll get bombarded
Ya on target, and bombed by some unsigned artists
We leave ya hair cut like a blind barber
Cut it, and gave you a line with fine markers
I won't leave till the job is done
Till the last prick nigga take ya wallet, run

Bust mines off tops, leave a rapper's nerves shocked

I want them rocks and that money in ya two socks

They go on the break-off, mental breakdown and shit you wouldn't think of
I spread it to Reggie, chances are better but deadly
You wanna be friendly on the get high Bentley
You twisted up, burnt out within seconds
Cos you couldn't hang with the John Blaze methods
Bong hittin', doc spittin', shark bitten
Star stricken, glock clickin', stop shittin'

Who approach us
These twin supersoakers
Who have poisonous darts for coppers
Too late to get your blowgun unholstered
You lept, light it up, and lightly toasted

So what?
I cut too much
Shut the fuck the up

You mutherfuckers turn in your gold

Up in his nose

Swing the vine on the bad boom nuts
I'm hairy as hell
Ahh to hell
And tatooed up
I'm a dog
Only fuck in the bathroom, what?
In high school I dealt only with the classroom sluts

My name is Johnny Donny Brasco
Talk the gat low
Cut your cash flow
Yell if you want money
Funny how hungry they'll be
Snatch crumbs from me
Dark and hard
Mix bodies in the mosh pit

Yo, and I'm the D.O.
You're lookin' at the raw invented
On Friday I spit
Thirty five to forty minutes
Smell up the bathroom
Like Craig Paul was in it
Ending up on your back
Whose whore's up in it
Anyone can match me
I crack 'em all a Guinness
Fuck how many thugs are playas?
A ball is in it
Brick city, Shaolin
Better call 'em sinners
Boys that'll run up in your
White mall and spill it

Brick City riding,then 'bout it 'bout it
Shoot up you town then we Bin Ladin hidin'
Meth, show'em where the luger kept
Open your safe, show me where the food and vest
I hope when Dre hear this, he give a beat for ten more
Cause I stay on the corner like squegeemen
Yo Nate Dogg, what's happening y'all
Long Beach, Brick City
Scream at your frog

All these hoes around me
She was lost in the land of love
Glad that Nate Dogg found me
Girl you got a phatty
New York back to Cali
You know who got the bomb weed
Long Beach to Brick City
I know just want you want, I got just want you need
Turn that shit around, and back it up on me

D-O-double-G, will you keep it gangsta please

[Snoop]
I gots to do it
Yes Yes loc', we keep the best smoke
Me and my nigga, my nerve, my kinfolk
I kick a bitch in the ass and then smoke
I'm a motherfucking fool in the pool doing the breaststroke
You want a problem, then lets go
Cause if not I came to disco
And freak this ho from Acopoqo
And flip her inside out, now I'm bout to ride
Let's go we hit the hood slow
Post up, set up shop and press four
Who got the best flow, who got the most dough
Who got the best hoes, nigga you know
Shit its been ten years since I hit some cess smoke
But I still rock a mean coat on the West Coast
In the summertime
And I crumble mine down to the dandelion
Nigga watch how I handle mine
Spiritual, hear we go, hear this
Snoop D-O-double-G, man I'm so fearless
Square biz, you know what time it is
I'm cool on these niggas but I'm hard on a bitch
Now check dis, fact is
Put your back out, now back in
Go head wiggle it round you feeling me now

Wide-body frame, E-Dub's the name, whoa

I know, I keep 'em clean though
Come through stormin' the block like El Nino
Scoop up an Arabic chick before she close
She goes, those my people
Yeah, them broads from Puerto Rico, them Keith's folks
Yeah, watch how the ""E"" locs 64
Black rags, black interior, shift on the floor
Burn out, I do it for the kids
They're hoppin' the turn style, the ""E"" goin' wild
Yo, like them white chicks on a DVD
Yeah, I'm worldwide, MTV and BET, nigga

[Verse Two: Redman]
Yo, do I gotta go ape or go nutty
I leave your eye like a 9-9 Benz-buggy, puffy
Brick niggas get real ugly
Trust me, keep your four if you feel lucky
Mug me, I ain't got nothin' but four figures
And weed and hash chopped in the coffee blender
My shots like squeegy men on your window
Usual suspect, I'm the crippled member
Get away when I sat down in the office
Heat in my lap keep me walkin' awkward
While y'all talk it, the doc reinforce it
The mic, it's hard to keep my paws off it
Yo' bitch is my bitch when it's over
No Cristal, I pulled up with King Cobra
Out in the Nova, don't bother
My Nino Brown bust, it'll shut down the corridor

[Repeat 1]

Hey yo Red, he's over (Word?) with his shit right now
Watch this, told ya

I'm that kid +Gizmo+, we ""Top Billin'""
Yo, when the roof is on fire, believe it, it's me
Sparks when I rock the mic like Segal & Free
When the pen hit the pad, the evil in me come out
Total recall for people to breathe

I got dogs in the backyard shittin' their lawns
We got chickens ain't leaving 'till six in the morning
Round and round we go, circle the area
Leave the party, go straight to the Marriott
Dozy-doe with cowboys where they saddle at
Rodeo with 20 fours on the Cadillac
What your name is, yo, R.E.D.
Crack cost money, but the ""E"" is free, yeah

I’m from the Bricks where the real car thieves
Rock this funky joint like PRT
Tricks up my sleeve, just gimme an hour
I bang two women on the Eiffel Tower

[Couplet 3 : Freeman]
Mes dits saignent, y'a tempête, voici un son d'compéte
Pour l'occas', khô, on ramène sur la poudrière l'allumette
Celle qui régénère, la base, et les crimes qu'on n'a pu commettre
Sur disque pour la peine v'l'a 5 comètes

[Couplet 4 : Shurik'n]
D'entrée le team occupe le ring comme Ali
Déjà ça palit sentant le péril proche le coeur
Kaki la plume façon coup de pioche phalange active
Place la droite en sortie de rotative, ressent la force vive
L'énergie de ce son où on sévit à vie
C'est le chant que nos tripes entonnent comme un choc
Electrique chaque phrase touche égotrip ou métaphorique
Blast les blasés sur actif puissant submersible
Vise l'esprit fier irascible, IAM irréductible

[Refrain : Shurik'n, Redman, Method Man, Akhenaton & Freeman]
Dès le départ, faut que tu comprennes
Understand that Redman got a gun and when I cock it back FIRE

Sens l'athmosphere, la haute sphère; la sale rime khô

[Couplet 5 : Method Man]
Yo the bigger they are the harder they fall
I got toe corns and love songs harder than y'all
I don’t fear nothing at all
Fronting at all
I even got female cops busting my balls
Don’t mess with my Meth, my disc in the deck
Is like a clip in the tech, your risking your neck
If your fixin' to flex
Come with your vest, or don’t come
Name the track I don’t run

J'débarque sec à la « starsky »

J'connais c'biz estampillé, mec averti qui médite

Tu reconnais le son tu veux ta part, n'essaie même

I’m an animal a real wise guy
I don’t talk, I let my boom bye bye
I shut down the club then I hit the Ave

Akhenaton:
Plutôt warrior comme Holly Field, ma poésie prolifique
Base mes origines au rap qui horrifie, la masse
Qui crache des orifices, la haine de l'habit comme
On hait l'uniforme, pas l'homme et la forme de nos rimes horripile
Le poids des maux tue les clavicules, et les choix que l'Etat
Véhicule, en laisse au régime, c'est la rage et l'écume

Terrorise comme les PSY 4 à coup d'crime auditif

I’m hard headed, my nuts the same
I’m bringing dope back in the game
Tap your vein and get a fix

Oh shit, yo, DJ Envy in the house nigga

You are so, vicious
I know you're vicious

Aiyyo dog, you gotta be a gilla nigga, to roll with us
A camp full of hardhitters, with no quitters
Smackin' the shit out gold diggers when the dough mentioned
Take out a new nigga rap, with a old symptom
Yeah, I'm Doctor Dude from, ""Malpractice""
Half you rappers ain't on crack, you just crackers
And backwards, I was forward when I wrote it
So when I spit I'll chip a few niggaz shoulders

I want dough, you're only penny like bologna
Haters watch y'all know they Envy, when the song bump
Talkin' 'bout they in the hood, where they hardly found
The whole hood got my number, call me now
I ain't gon' read your palm, I know your future
Only thing I need was the street you're on
Now parked on your lawn is, two Denalis
Niggaz squattin' with gloves and, Bruno Malis

New York and Cali, we don't play fair
If it's thick we rob chicks for they J-Lo wear
Give it to they baby moms, and say it's a gift
'Cause when I ball in my palm, I'ma play it to win, c'mon

You are so, vicious
I know you're vicious
You are so vicious
I know you're vicious

I gotta, watch where I'm goin', start goin' where I watch
It's summertime, but it's like snowin' in my watch
Check the funk Doc, the Lyor Cohen of the block
2020 Benz unfoldin' out the box
Futuristic kid, fuck if your team holdin'
I'm shittin' on y'all and I ain't begin to clean colony
I'll snatch the crown from whatever king holdin'
The unforgettable, Nat King Flow'n

Jack the rapper, like a conference
I'm passin' out demo tapes with shotties under the armpits
Tellin' you to listen to it, or you die young
My music like ecstacy, ever try one?
Throw your guns, it's a law to bein' men
And I'm that all day, like the war on CNN
I turn your day to short, make the night go long
I got Doug E. sayin', ""Reggie, on the mic, you're on""

Blast your state trooper, I'm on the run G
I've got these hoes spreaded, from Japanese to diabetics
Toes stay painted because of my foot fetish
You damn right, they had to ban me from eatin pussy all night
W-W-F'n bitches
Slammin em in the rope like Shawn Mike
I can't be touched bitch, I disco in kryptonite
Shit I'm broke as hell
I had to buy all my girls fifty-fo'-eleven Reeboks at wholesale
Almost got caught boostin out of Bodell's
Bitches on my coattails like they coat rails
Can't even go in a jam without a bitch grabbin my hand
And squeezin my ass sayin ""Youse the man!""
That's who the fuck I be
I got a, college degree, on bomb-zee and wreckin MC's
Makin shit happen like Lil' Cease
I come from a land of fonto leaf, bark from trees
That stick in your hand, and lakes rollin sea-weed
Criminals be up to no good
So I tuck a heater
Bulletproof suit still in the fuckin cleaners, but anyways
I bumped into my neighbor Johnny Blaze
Told me there's a bitch up the block who got more cock than AK's
The bitch just moved in, in building 210
Right next door to the Fantastic Four, and the Penguin
Good lookin Johnny, five-oh's right behind me
Let me act like I know and get ghost
Tuck in my Nina-Ross, get my cape and shades
Now I'm off with the Soopaman Three antidote

Smoked a pound of Purple Rain and kept control

I read one name it said EPMD
I turned her ass around I said no it couldn't be
It was the J-to-tha-A-to-tha-N-to-tha-E
Her pussy walls grabbed my dick so I'm stuck
So I burnt that ass from that blunt hash that I lit up

Yo, security pattin'
My legs and waist

All my niggaz in the huddle
On the count of three
We gonna bumrush The Tunnel
With a pound of weed
Cut the light on, you see
It's Brick City in here
Blazin' like Biggie passed us
A semi in here
Don't sleep, stay wide awoke
You dialed Doc, not dial-a-joke
Crawl or you'll die in smoke
I keep it heated when the hawk is out
Seated low Tahoe, beat it
When the dark is out
I'm outside of the line
And I'm actin' a fool
Like a three o'clock bully
Waitin' after school
(Punks) I've been in
This line for hours
I even killed the time by helpin'
My man pass out fliers
Now all I want to do is
Get in where I fit in
Shake my as* with the
Baddest pidgeon with her wig in
Jump, move, crash
Smoke, drink
Shake that as* stank
The fuck you think?
Poppa Bear at the table, and
The porridge is pourin'
Since +Def+ is the label
I belong in a morgue
I'm walkin' half-dead, actin' senile
With bigga niggaz from jail
Than the one on ""Green Mile""

I'll snuff a duck, I'm headed Uptown

Mic check, mic check (mic check mic check one two)
One two, one two check mic (yeah)
Gilla House, D-Block baby (can y'all hear me out there?)
Yo, hey yo

[Chorus 2X: Sheek and Redman]
Get up, stand up - throw your hands up
All my thug niggaz throw your motherfuckin hands up
Get up, stand up - throw your hands up
All y'all pretty bitches throw your motherfuckin hands up

[Sheek Louch]
Hey yo, I got a letter from the governor, the other day
I opened, I read it, and this is what it say
It's time for you to get yo' stack right
The bitch don't act right, whatever put that bitch on the next flight
Whatever nigga step in your way, hit his ass with the K
And leave his body where his children'll play
I cook somethin up like Emeril's kitchen
I put the heat to these rap dudes, whatever let me know who's bitchin
And your security as pussy as you are
The burners come out, his big ass be the first to the car
I got goons that'll make it spark, and I don't gotta throw a blow
Niggaz ready to stage dive like they Linkin Park
The hood love a nigga cause I ain't above a nigga
I eat the same shit in the hood as another nigga
White tee, pants saggin, ready to mug a nigga
Get the hell up out your seats and everybody jump

[Chorus]

[Redman]
Yo - yo Sheek lemme get some of that, yo
Aiyyo my uzi weigh a ton, Redman half baked
I'm smokin pounds, you hang around with Nasty Nate
The great dane straight change, bitches close drapes
Cause my product, Ultramagnetic like cool Keith
This for my hood niggaz sellin sticky by the sto'
I rip your hottest MC like eenie mynie moe
Fuck dough I do it for fun, ""Juice"" like Bishop
""American Pie"" nigga, hit your momma like Stiffler
Redman and Sheek Louch, you got a brief clue
Who will tie you up like E did to P in ""Beef Two""
I cheat dude, give me a Maybach to breathe
So I'm determined, like AJ after Free
I don't play games I'm grown, on 26 chrome
Inside of my truck is ESPN Zone
Shame on a nigga, that try to run game on a nigga
I bring pain on a nigga

[Chorus]

[Sheek Louch]
Hey yo fuck that nigga, buck that nigga
Chase him to the roof, somebody cut that nigga
Pushed 1100, one wheel up (c'mon Sheek)
Lil' entrepeneur; shit, I'm already one deal up (D-Block)
Grants to a bird - okay, I ain't sell a lot
But shit Jigga ain't go platinum 'til his third
I'm one song away, but you would think I did
How the house got that long ass drive-a-way
Benz in the back, doors do Karate Kid
If they knew I get the same time Gotti did
240 when it's floored, trey pound on my lap
Beyonce bobblehead on the dashboard
Can't be ignored, I'm the coke niggaz can't afford
I'm the town niggaz haven't toured
I got a dutch or two, we can smoke a few
But first this is what y'all motherfuckers gotta do

Redman,"One shot deal, one shot one kill
Hit you with the one shot skill
Bullets lift you up like you poppin' on the wheel
Feel I can't die when I'm poppin' on the pill
So real that it feel, keep Cochran on my heels
Who rock the black and back out
Now the MAC back out, just bout to blackout
Got the ROC on my back, SP on my chain
Shooters on the block slinging P last name
Outta hot pink things like Camron Range
The cocaine cowboy at work
I put ya niggas in the dirt for one like Dirt
Concealed hammer won't jam or won't chirp
Catch you on my second merk
Fresh outta jail, ice grill gat to smirk
Bitches on the waste can't serve 'em
ROC without Jay won't work?
Shit like we ain't here
Actin' like SP ain't here
How y'all niggas can't see that clear? Clear?
Yeah, slow all the way down young scrapper
Pump ya brakes real fast, before ya crash
Crack ya head on the dash
I put ya body in a cast, keep my shotty on blast
Hard heads don't get the picture until they see the flash
You ain't ballin', you pump faking
Till you found in ya trunk naked
Four pound to ya crown like, ""Where the paper?""
B. Sig, cold crook, I trap paper like notebook
When the hot water disappear like when coke cook
Then resurface, its Sig. Berk-owitz, bitch I'm sick
Leave that ass like Dama
Sig. heat that ass like sauna
Stretch ya body out like recliner
Stretch my middle finger to your honor
like, ""Fuck the world"", that's my persona, love drama
Drop a building like Osama, you vagina
I know you wish you never met me like Carl Thomas
Try to forget me like all silence
Fuckin' with a vet be, all problems
I'm not about the threats B, I'm all promise
Before ""The Truth"", position in the booth
As a young scrap, I was vicious as a youth
Kept a gat moving pigeons in the Coupe
You was strapped, then positioned on the stoop
Stay strapped, put my pistol on shoot
Mac take ya ""Juice"" like Bishop on the roof
I had ya pissing in ya trunk like a roof
Bullets hit ya chest like a blunt rolled loose
I'm that corn liquor nigga, 100 proof
I bring the storm, all you niggas lace ya boots
Better yet, pull out ya strings, make a noose
Hang yaself, here's a deuce deuce, bang yaself like Cheddar Bob
I'm in the hood like S-T-tall cat-Crooked Letter-I
S-P-C-O, nigga yes I

Yes I
Matta fact
Yeah, Yeah
Bring it back

Bring it back, me, Doc, America's blunted
Not from there, but I'm Philly Most Wanted

Talk is greasy, tongue with Crisco oil

At ww.cutanigga.com
Bricks, two on the hip, reach for the sky
You and ya Burberry suit is buried alive
On top of the Empire, dare me to dive
Wee there I go, no parachute
Jackass like Knoxville, hot as Cancun
Chest hair is baboon, Redman rip the show
I be the raw in ya bitches nose
She be goin' to the bathroom, sniffing blow
Like, ""Oh Docta shit, my man a joke""
I know, I be strapped with a double 4-4
And a Slim Jim to open ya Cadillac door
In the Bricks you hear them guns

Any bitch that know, Redman goin' the distance
We ain't tryin' to get fucked for instance
When you bust baby, goin' light the incense
Pass me the rag, hop back in the Jag
I stole out the showroom with the price tag
I wrote this rhyme off 25 blunt drags

Redman,"Stick em up, stick em up! I got the jammie to your vest punk
Don't make a move! Before I choose to make your guts run
All over the block, cause my stomach's in a knot
And it growls twenty-four hours a day around the tick-tock
I got roaches and vats of the rats carryin bats and gats
So I *farting noise* 'fore I snack Jack
Because I'm not down with water from the hydrant
My moms takin a bath and my brother's next arrivin
I gotta think of a plan so I can eat
I haven't had a cracker for weeks so my mouth leaks
I squat up, cause I'mma set up this kid, carryin loot out
From Burger King and what I'mma do is..
Run up on him, snatch the bag of money, then bust the dummy!
Cause my man when I think of a plan there's no shorts take
Cause I pack jammies inside of my Nordface, coat
Had the black brother on scope
No joke's what I am cause the man's a pure pro
(Yo my man you got a light?
Yeah give me the effin money too G!) Yo STOP STOP STOP!
Took the money then I dipped with the quickness
The plan went well so I got down to the business
Opened up the bag it was filled with paper
I thought I freaked the funk but now starts the caper
Cause I was set up, now I have to go head up with the cops
What they carryin? Black Glocks (shit's thick!)
What's the next move? My life's on the line
Bullets in their clips and none in mine
Sirens on, once again it's on
I fell (OW!) and then the black Glocks went POW!
I got snuffed and I got bust
Now the only thing I'm sniffin is dust, cause it's

It's so rough

Me and Erick Sermon takin a trip Uptown
In the ? run a blast and my tape pumpin ganja
Since Erick got props
I step to this hottie with more damn body than a chop shop
Flexed the jewels then she chose to talk to me
It was no doubt that baby cakes was hawkin me
So I kicked it, upped the digits, terrific
Not knowin she was scopin me cause I was MAD splifted
Later on that week honeydip freaked the funk
Playin Redman and Erick out like two chumps
Callin him weekdays, callin me weeknights
(Who had her weekends?) Whichever man would freak right
Things got cozy one night like dynamite
We stripped to bare backs and took care of the bare facts
No hats? Went Funkadelic
Took a splash, you know how that go fellas
Two months later (see you later alligator)
She was pissed and, I ended up seein my physician
She took a blood test, she took a head check
Looked at me thinkin, ""Why the hell he isn't dead yet?""
Then I asked her, ""Why you lookin at me?!""
She said, ""Redman because you have the HIV""
Called Erick and his set, that girl, don't mess around!
Too late, cause Erick already had his drawers down
Cause it's

It's so rough
Cause it's so rough!

To all my brothers wear your hats wear your hats
You can either get with this or you can either catch the claps
And to my sisters, make em wear they prophyl-lastic
Cause it's drastic, havin another ghetto bastard
Think I'm vyin for a piece of butt? Honey you must be nuts
You better settle for a wet kiss so pucker up
Cause you end up messin around catchin the heebie jeebies
Lookin like WHODUNNIT? Witcha face up on the TV
So next time you want sex, get wreck, but protect
Cause you could be like sexin to your last death
And if you still don't know the time, press rewind
Cause the next thing you might hear is a flatline",So Ruff,2006

Yeah! Oh, listen to this!
We gonna come at ya!

Cypress Hill!
Yo yo yo, all my niggas say jump up, doc broke out the kennel
A dog on four paws spittin' out the window
Jump up! It ain't no need to fight
We may squeeze the pipe, you gonna bleed tonight
I eat beans and rice, shit up a storm
I walk the streets with shark fin off my arms
Doctor Dolittle, lit off the bone
My bracelet like I raised it off the farm
Home-grown, thick, dirty 
My family feud dudes who pack 2's on survey
Jersey and house 
Gun like an elephants snout
Pull ya ambulance out
Ya whole team'll get bombarded
Ya on target, and bombed by some unsigned artists
We leave ya hair cut like a blind barber
Cut it, and gave you a line with fine markers
I won't leave till the job is done
Till the last prick nigga take ya wallet, run!
Doc with the shotty and we both catch a body with Cypress Hill
Yeah!

We don't give a fuck, we live it up till the day we die
You try to deal with us, but you got no blunts to get high
You won't be real with us, but ya reelin' us and you want to ride
You try to deal with us, but you got no blunts to get high

Yo, yo
Blunt smokin', half a bottle of remi open
You either holdin' or half-assed like Simmy Colan
I leave ya chokin' on them lollipop rhymes ya callin'
So hard, hell I crack the shell on ya candy coatin'
If the shoes fit like Alan I be too thick
Ever since you hit, yo my new chicks a new bitch
Ya know if I can't eat, ya can't sleep
Plus I'm in denial, I just can't admit defeat
My mind is my glock, keep my third eye cocked
Bust mines off tops, leave a rapper's nerves shocked
Now who's hot and who's not
I want them rocks and that money in ya two socks 
Meth the mister, if crime is an art, then let me paint a picture
I'm gone, Kodak can't even frame the riddler
Gold realin', Meth, doc, Cypress Hiller
Whoever think they fuckin' with that, lets be realer

[Chorus]

Take the back seat and smash beats 
Smoke blunts through ya lungs and flips ya brain cells like athletes
Run a track meet, the rhymes on ya rap sheet
With the foot long crush bong, look your collapsing, sicko
They go on the break-off, mental breakdown and shit you wouldn't think of
I spread it to Reggie, chances are better but deadly
You want to be friendly on the get high Bentley
You twisted up, burnt out within seconds
Cause you couldn't hang with the John Blaze methods
Bong hittin', doc spittin', shark bitten 
Star stricken, glock clickin', stop shittin'
Inhale the smoke from the master's lungs
You want to roll up, yo I'm the fastest one (ha!)
You want to test with the sess, well first off
That shit is funny like Kid Rock with his shirt off
