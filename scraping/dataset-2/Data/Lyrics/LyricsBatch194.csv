Eightball,"[Verse One: MJG]
Here comes the one they call the P.I. -- M.P.
Straight out the cut no one can see I -- bust these
Way out of touch with all them bustas in my rear view
but see they game, so lame, I can hear through
I Hens doggin at the bar, actin real nice (real nice)
Six pack of Hen, straight up, with no ice -- tap me twice
Did you really want my full attention?
Sometimes my mind (intertwine) with the tenth dimension
I see you inchin to my ride, tired, rest them legs
Soon as you open up your mouth (uhh) there's the head
Now who I be, MJG, certified, mic controller
(Uncle Sam, I want you!) Trick bend over
I'm a petrified rapper talkin, and you ain't nuttin
but an electrified shyster walkin, I'm tired of savin
people from takin these dead end trips, I'ma just go
and bust this champagne upside your ship, alright you hip?
You in a hurry? You can't relate?
Don't ever say that I ain't try to set it to you straight
I'm out the gate before you hate but I'll be back again
You saw me faintly through the crowd but now I'm in the wind
Once again

[Chorus: Eightball and MJG]
In the wind, it's a bird, it's a plane
Now it be them hustlers with that skin tight game
In your mix, scopin you, scopin me
Eightball and MJG to the end, bustas we in the wind

[Verse Two: Eightball]
I sold my soul to this hustle, homeboy scratch what you heard
T front me a keyboard, I flipped it like a bird, word
on them streets be them Suave House beats
In the Benz blowin Sweets got your gal between my sheets
Speak -- I ain't have to say one little thang
The fame of my name blew the ghetto freak brain
Lookin for a meal ticket, she let me stick it
Wicked when she lick it, tryin to make me trick it
Girl, when I was broke it seemed all about the luxury
Now I got cheese, I got a pay a girl to love with me
But I'm a jelly worker, like Smuckers
Workin against them suckers, big facin just to love a
broad that done been around the world in a day
Bear lovin whoever got cheddar to pay
Ball like no trick ass, them shakers if I tip
I be drunk, in the club, smokin sticky cat nip
Slip, as if a banana peel was dropped in my path
into a body bodyworkin not discussin no math
Playa haters all around me as I stumble and grin
Snatch my vest, twist somethin, hit the rumble and then...

[Chorus 2X]
[Verse Three: MJG, Eightball]
I flip scripts on young dips who think they hip
Smoke up your whole zip, sess hydro or crip
Time and time again, stories have been told
About the super hustler dyin tryin to get the gold
Concrete jungle full of, carnivorous firearm
Hunger for flesh, and pray on who ain't strong
Heavy weighters, with plenty hoes that buy em alligators
In the wind, breakin all big ?

Pick artificial tricks stolen money makers
Money trees come in please, help a player shake a
million down to the ground, feel them hits fall
Ride with me I'll run your game into a brick wall, trick why'all
is what this false literary do, then reality come
(and snatch the natural dust out you) who speaks the truth?
Whose your leeches? Whose your friends?
I plan to bring the realness back again, but until then
I'm in the wind

[Chorus 4X]",In the Wind,2015
Eightball,"Yeah
Infamous in ya area
Eightball in ya area
About to cause mass hysteria

Yo, ashes to ashes big gats to little

Trained to tread through land to get muddy

Ayo, blood rap
Survival of the fifth style cat
I puts it down blow a round at your baseball cap
Pee, Niggas saying damn why I be like that
Listen close you can learn from it
It's real black

Gangsta shit makes the world rotate
If eight was all make a nigga want to gain some weight
Fat belly black motherfuckin D-O-G
And I'm a thug for them young niggas thuggin for me

Ayo
Fuck where you at kid

'Cause where we from niggas pack nothing but the big guns
To all my Queens Duns, niggas who pump drugs
To all the housing projects who rep for they hood

Live and direct from the south to your stereo
Prepare for bustin and dumpin okay player here we go
Strapped with infa-red raps when I hit the traps
Crack the wack into pieces when I hit the track
Like stone to glass I shatter they raggedy ass
South style waiving my motherfuckin soldier rag
A hard illustration of my brutal lifestyle
Memphis Ten made a lot of niggas buck wild
The root to all evil daily I chase it
Blow it on weed and drink then hustle to replace it
It's hard from the start where I lay my head
We get rowdy and bust shots till we raise the dead

Yo fuck where you at kid

'Cause where we from niggas pack nothing but the big guns
To all my gold grill niggas and my trail niggas
South to east we keep it hard for them real niggas

Feel my though, You don't want to get filled up with holes
Moms filling out surgery cards blowing her nose
Wiping her tears cause something on your top got shot
Should have brought alone wit you what you loaned on the block
Fuck, leaving without it dunn I'd rather get knocked
Charged with a ten body for a nigga get shot
For a weak ass bitch, fuck that little whore
Even though she get my dick harder than the parol board
Stick and move, slide in, slide out big guns
Mack milly prepare to mob you steel phillies
Connected with Eightball dunn so what's the drilly
Out to take it all if you wit me then feel me

Don't get yourself shot
Bleedin to death hops
I pop canners off leave a nigga head whopped
A maverick my H-K will work magic
You'll find yourself in the O are for talkin that shit
Street justice I tip the scale over cousin
I hold more weight you just a no name nigga frontin
Get your hardware lets treat it like a contest
And we can dance till one of us drop from being hit
Murda Muzik my street life influenced it

A renegade crack your top like devil spring
Vigilante niggas know the song I sing

Eightball,"She got a loose booty, she got a loose booty
Pay attention to how it shake, she got a loose booty
She got a loose booty, she got a loose booty
Pay attention to how it shake, she got a loose booty

I ain't tryin' to be stuck all in the corner and locked up
Tongue-kissin' a hoe a nigga know she a doctor
Hoe can make a nigga think she a queen
She standin' there, smellin' like potpourri, I bet she stank in them jeans

Need to shake it, wash it, rinse it, squeeze it and douche it
Call a time-out, freeze, at ease that pussy
They comin' out the woodworks, ain't no pride
They don't get tired, play they vibe and they'll shake it 'til they foot hurt

Say she dressin' for time, she got a lot of that
She ain't no nickel and dime, she got a dollar back
When she step her ass bounce two times
The wobble, wobble, make it hard for her to walk straight lines

Gotta add the soldiers on when you standin' behind her
You might get stuck in there and need a camera to find her
Gotta hold on to them handlebars 'cause you don't want that broad
Goin' tellin' your dawgs you got handled boy

She got a loose booty, she got a loose booty
Pay attention to how it shake, she got a loose booty
She got a loose booty, she got a loose booty
Pay attention to how it shake, she got a loose booty

She got a loose booty, she got a loose booty
Pay attention to how it shake, she got a loose booty
She got a loose booty, she got a loose booty
Pay attention to how it shake, she got a loose booty

You make a nigga wanna pay for that pussy hoe
Stand it up and make you get up on your tiptoes
Play with love man, kiss it, baby, watch him grow
Don't run your mouth about it, momma try to keep it low

Let's get a room somewhere deep on the outskirts
Give me head 'til yo' muh'fuckin' mouth hurts
Go tell your friends 'bout the suite up at the W
About the view and all the freaky shit I done to you

Now, when she see me, when you're not around
She be in my face, tryin' to see what I'm about
Here, take my number, maybe you can take me out
Take you somewhere and put some dick up in your mouth

I remember when you bitches wasn't so nice
Before the rings and the watches got a coat of ice
Same nigga, different day, we forever say
Money over bitches, U.T.P., Eight way

She got a loose booty, she got a loose booty
Pay attention to how it shake, she got a loose booty
She got a loose booty, she got a loose booty
Pay attention to how it shake, she got a loose booty

She got a loose booty, she got a loose booty
Pay attention to how it shake, she got a loose booty
She got a loose booty, she got a loose booty
Pay attention to how it shake, she got a loose booty

Oh, I like the way you move it to the right, girl
No, I like the way you shake it to the left, girl
No, I like it when you bend it, when you step girl
Now, touch your toes while you hold your breath girl

And I ain't come here to ruin your night
I'm tryin' to put somethin' new in your life
Just by doin' you right, we can go somewhere for two if you like
Use the stars and the moon for the light 'cause you movin' it right

See, I'm really tryin' to do you tonight
If you dyke, bring your crew if you like
If any, um, booty is like, your booty is like
Call your whole crew booty delight, we make it 'Nolia Clap'

Don't hold it back, touch the flo' with that
I got a heart attack, your booty causin' cataract
I can't even stay on it, look I keep on fallin' back
My momma always told me Skip don't ever fall for that

She got a loose booty, she got a loose booty
Pay attention to how it shake, she got a loose booty
She got a loose booty, she got a loose booty
Pay attention to how it shake, she got a loose booty

She got a loose booty, she got a loose booty

hand around of the handle of my snub  no skill

heading to the river skeeming up on how to take a 

boat from a victim, rush right up and stick him 

with a sharp object making sure that I get him 

put it to the river, see, nervous as a lunatic 

jumped out of the veichle as borrowed me a boat quick

(Eightball) 

Flying through the air on my way to Jamaica 

thinking about why I took the money for the faka 

me living poor and wishing to be richer 

and me like Picasso I had to paint a picture 

of people dying rapidly, trying to imprison me 

just because I took a little money in a robbery 

landed in Jamaica chilling with the dreads 

smoking on the gunja messing with my head 

the feds came behind me hit me with a billy club 

I fell to the ground, turned around pumping slugs 

jumped up quick, ditched the gun as I ran away 

ran to the hills where I hid for a few days 

no, I'm not the one that they will catch soon 

bought me a palace in the hills wit' a hundred rooms

Eightball & MJG," 

[Verse 1: MJG]
Pimpin hoes was some shit that came easy to a playa
Cause ain't no way in hell a bitch could get me to a bail
And how in the fuck I'll ever make some money if I'm pail
My hoes sell pussy at the party for the mayor
400 for the chewin, 100 for the mackin
1,000 for the fucking, 200 for the jackin
Soon as the day is over, my bitch is checkin in
I'ts just like deja vu, again and then again bitch

[Girl]
Come on, Wait a minute MR. MJG
Do you really think anyone's gonna believe that pimpin shit
Huh, I guess not
Haven't you heard, that pimpin shit is dead

[Verse 2: MJG]
Bitch chill, Hold up, you got a pimp fucked up
Can't help it cause you don't know, ain't my fault that you stuck up
Ya parents didn't teach ya, the streets didn't reach ya
I'm makin easy money from the judge and the preacher
The mayor likes the bitches cause they beat him with a chain
The judge and the preacher love to hear dirty thangs
The governor was first on the bitch payin list
He busted a nut soon as the bitches touched his dick

[Verse 3: Eightball]
Comin out smooth, livin like a pimpsta
Gotta flee the bitches and they all call me mista fat mac
Pimp tight, what the fuck you want to do?
See me in the streets, sweep 'em off and down you and your crew
Gotta be ruthless, smackin hoes toothless
Suckas gettin dropped when I'm poppin with the glock bitch
And the niggaz that hide cap and act like hoes
When they see the 93 with the switches and the voes

[Girl]
Eightball, tell the truth

Talkin bout pimpin and shootin up niggaz
And braggin bout fuckin, what'z up wit that?

[Verse 4: Eightball]
I'm big as a motherfucker, I don't look fast
But I'll jump up quick, and stick my dick in yo ass
And for you niggaz that talk shit, don't step too quick
You know who got my back, a clip full of hollow tips
Tec, 9 millimeter, glock or 22
Mafia style, don't even fuck with the pimpsta crew
Bust the yak and pass me that bud sack
Cause niggaz with nuts, can't even fuck with the fat mac

[Verse 5: MJG]
25 birds on the counter in the den
Nigga gettin bailed cause they go for 5-10
Pot good and hot now I'm lookin for the shaker
Water start to bubble sprinkle in the money maker
The shit is gettin thick I think my pager just exploded
11 birds left, 13 I just sold it
I gotta close shop before it get too fuckin late

You know you guys really shouldn't be sellin cocaine to other brothers
It's killin us all off man

Makin us look bad

[Verse 6: MJG]
The cops work for me cause I keep good stuff
And plus the government ain't never paid dem tricks enough
And every time a cop bust some dope in the drug rade
Feds swangin birds in the hood by the next day
While I'm makin money off the shit that I done fronted
Nigga fell short, shoot 'em up yeah I done it
MJG Pushin real not cut
Got the feds in my pocket, and the chief by his nuts

[Verse 7: Eightball]
Roll a fat bud, smoke the bitch and then I'm chilled
Fall off in the club drinkin yak dressed to kill
Niggaz that be jealous cause dem hoes be on the jock
Don't disrespect my pimpin or you I will have to drop
No I don't be playin, what I'm sayin what I speak
Some niggaz don't understand then I have to go and teach
What Eightball is about and what the future got for me
A screw of dead niggaz and a pocket full of grip G

Dem niggaz ain't goin never be shit
Dem niggaz forever gettin fucked up { laughs }

Punk ass niggaz that talk shit can get down on their knees
Suave got the hook up cause suave got the cheese
And I got the bomb and MJG is in the tank
Posessin ya mind and then we blow up the bank
Yank yo hoe from the front row, and then jet out
When we get to the hotel, your bitch is on the house
Fuckin and suckin a pimpsta, fuckin and suckin a pimpsta
What, we through, pass me that joint nigga",The First Episode,1993
Eightball & MJG,"8Ball: Now, I was broke as a muthafucka, my life at the end see
My so called friends, they had no ends to lend me.
My job at Mickie Ds was fuckin me with no grease
I worked so damn hard, but the money, it never increased.
I quit my fuckin job, I had no job nigga
Put on the mask, get the gloc, it's time to rob nigga.
I hit the streets, but no victim had been chosen
Damn I was nervous, but my fear wouldn't stop my strollin.
Then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, I was struck
I felt the burn of bullets, so I knew I had got bucked.
Reachin for my tech, the bullets hit me in my chest
My eyes closed shut, and I thought I seen death.
I woke up at the med still woozy from my jackin
T-Money walked in and he told me what had happened.
I knew him from the hood, but I did not know him well
He drove a red jag, and I knew that he was bale.
He said he was rollin when he seen me in distress
He said he killed the muthafuckin niggas with his tech.
He offered me a job said he'd front me what I needed
I said that I was with it dreamin one day I would be..
Mr. Big!

chorus: Mr. Big, Mr. Big, they call him Mr. Big
Mr. Big, Mr. Big, but not because of my size.
Mr. Big, Mr. Big, they call him Mr. Big
Mr. Big, Mr. Big, but not because of my size.
Mr. Big, Mr. Big, they call him Mr. Big
Mr. Big, Mr. Big, but not because of my size.
Mr. Big, Mr. Big, they call him Mr. Big
Mr. Big, Mr. Big, but not because of my size.

8Ball: I hit the street slaning ya-yo, then I sold up my block
Sellin 8, sellin deals, sellin $20 rocks.
Sellin dimes, sellin nickels to the junkies on my tracks
Gettin my dick sucked with the crumbs from the crack.
Some fool tried to jack me, but he only had a knife
A clip full of hollow tips took the bitches' life.
Standin on the track, my mobile rung and it was T
""Hello?"" -- ""Yo Eight, be the fuck aroung 3"" --""Aight!""
I met him at the park, he had a job for me again
Rob some Columbians, and get my ass in.
Hit for 30 birds, if I live, I'd get five
I smoked them damn Columbians, and then got what was mine.
All the time, my clientel rappidly increased
My bank got bigger, that's when bitches started jockin me.
Cars and clothes had me fuckin different hoes
A fat bank roll was keepin me cool with the 5-O.
I had niggas workin under me to take the heat
I never touched the dope, makin a 100 Gs a week.
I gained respect, I'm the biggest playa of all time
Don't ever fuck with me, cause I'm ...
Mr. Big!

repeat chorus:

8Ball: Chillin at the club with T-Money and J-be
Lil Adrian and Boo, and my nigga, MJG.
I had the bitches staring at the twinkle of my diamonds.
Drinkin on this Yak, makin my way to the back.
When I saw this little bitch lookin finer than the rest.
With a long black weave and a tight red dress.
I started conversatin, but she didn't want to talk to me
Straight up to the hotel room, now the bitch is suckin the
Dick of this nigga that is smarter than the bitch thank
Then she got up, now somethin in the air stank.
She went in the bathroom and locked the door behind her
I got off the bed and grabbed the tech from the dresser.
Stood by the door when it opened, niggas came out
Grab my muthafuckin gun, ""Hey nigga!"" *pow pow*
Then, I grabbed the girl cause some more niggas had busted in
Shot that bitch in the dome with my muthafuckin chrome
Shot up all the niggas, but I took one in the leg
When the cops busted in, I was laying on the bed.
Walked up out the room, did I go to jail?
Hell no! They can't stop me..
Long live Mr. Big Ho!!!!

",Mr. Big,1993
Eightball & MJG,"(Eightball)
Ah yea
Eightball & MJG in the muthafuckin house
We came here today to talk to about this thing
called pimpin
It has been misunderstood over the years
so now we have come to set the record straight
niggas don't do this shit right
it takes a special kind of nigga
you know what I'm sayin
yeah

It takes a nigga dat hard from the start
you gotta have heart
to meet a bitch, mack hard down, then rip her apart
it's all in the game, a nigga can't change
if you don't break a bitch
then your game is lame man
see I'm from Tennesee
wit curls and gold teeth
so every were I go, bitchs strike up conversations wit me
about the way I talk, about the way I dress, about
how my gold teeth look so fresh
see how I bait a man, seen as a nigga speak
that deep voice just make a bitch knees weak
I'm in my cadallic, chillin like a fatmack
smoking on a fat sac, drinkin' on a pint of yac
I pick up my car phone, call the freak beat
It's my nigga baby mama, but sometimes I creap
that's just the way it is, niggas have to take a chance
when you ain't around, anybody could be in dat ass
But I just a young nigga, trying to make a dolla
and they way I live, to some it's hard to swalla
see livin' down south ain't what you think it be
nine times out of ten niggas like me
pimps

Ya that's right
we trying to teach all these lames, you know
how to do this shit
cause it's really a hard job
but them lame niggas
they make me get so high

(Chorus)

I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
I get so high
and I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground

(MJG)

Now let me explain a pimp
a nigga about the m-o-n-e-why
see a hoe, break a hoe
and try to influence the bitch, to a trick the nigga who
persuaded her to sell ass like hoes suppose too
now how in the fuck do you think a pimp is slippin
surrounded by all these hoes
that's going and givin me money
it's funny how a hoe can make you think she wit ya
when all the time
she's just another niggas gold digger
MJG got a bitch for a rich trick
take care of your business
bring me the money, ya this shit is thick
hoe don't violate, bitch I know I taught you better
take all of cash, grab on his ass
write dat trick a love letter
train your woman to break a man
man meeting another nigga
just some shit in the game, same-o-same
to make you pimpin thicker
slicker the pimpin gets, freaker gets the bitch
MJG is rich, I'm coe-coe for this tricks
I pimp

Ya that's right baby 
I pimp
so uh, what you need to do is sat dat ass there
and uh, right about now, I bout to fire up one of these spliffs
and get so high

(Chorus) 2x

(Eightball)

Part 2
It's all the same G
trying to school fools, on this P-I-M-P
lession one
first you should pull a bitch, fuck her good
next time tell her no, the next time take her dough
oh, you better watch your back to man
cause there's a lot of bitchs in the world wit much game
lession two
watch dat hoe, don't trust her wit none of yo dough
never let a bitch know, how you much yo cash flow
lession three
if you don't tell dat hoe who is boss
bitchs like to run shit 
but end up getting smacked in the mouth
see a real nigga believe in beatin them hoes down
push they head into the wall until you hear dat crackin sound
drown in the tub, rub-a-dub-dub
some niggas get pussy whipped and fall into them love bugs
buying hoes this, buying hoes that
then bragging to your friends
how you fucked her from back
never how you took they cash, never how you beat they ass
never how you pull hoes, fuck them, then dropping fast
I don't understand your plan at all man
but you should be around niggas like me 
pimps

Ya man
this niggas is a trip, you know what I'm sayin
but niggas like me, I have to smoke them spliffs
to get my mind off dat shit, and when I smoke um'
I get so high

(Chorus) 2x

Wherever there's a hoe
there's bound to be a pimp
the pimp supplys his bitchs wit some tricks 
dat they can tempt
a sucker will spend his money, till he ain't got nothin left
instead of blamming the bitch, he needs to blame it on himself
it wouldn't be hoe, if it wasn't for the tricks
but I suggest we keep em', so a pimp can keep his bitch
It needs to be understand, there wouldn't be one without the other
so why the fuck these folks keep trying to sweat a muthafucka
jealous suckers just mad!!!
they can't hang with the pimp thang, looking to sprinkle some salt 
in a pimps game
how in the fuck do you figure pimpin is dead when nigga you know it's alive
pimpin is misunderstood by those who can't, that's why they said it died
others tried pimpin, but were only makin chump change
one track minded niggas never run a Amtrain
rearrange shit dat they done seen in a movie script
dam ain't dat a bitch, niggas like me
pimp

MJ fuckin G, P-I-M-P
staying down on this pimpin bout' these hoes
but some niggas fuck shit up for real niggas
and dat shit just makes me get so high

(Chorus) 5x",Pimps,1993
Eightball & MJG,"[MJG]
1 to the muthafuckin 2 to the muthafuckin 3
The sound of the boom is sweatin ya hard like a mystery
Could It be
The pimps could rule the nation in '93'
And MJG is gonna start a new race
Replace the weak tapes we got in the first place
And chase that live on cops quick, out the hood
And beat that ass like a cop would real good
And keep that bud goin on like the Flinstones
And shake them bones when you feel the ? comin on
See up in the ground, down a hit and lean back
Look at ya self and see what I'm sayin is real fat
Society lives off what the media tells us
And niggaz be joinin up wit the shit that they mail us
See pimpin ain't dead yet, see pimpin can pay the rent
And pimpin is demonstrated by those in the government
The money they send you ain't shit but nickels and dimes
And you been stuck in the ghetto since 1979
But it's time to switch it up, unhook it and fix it up
Change it and rearrange it, complete and pick it
It's a book with hard covers that's packed with ideas
We rule the future years
Erase the black fears
And change the system, step up and dismiss them
Tricks from the White House
Move in and they move out
Now I'm runnin thangs, my workers walk wit a limp
My whole staff is bitches and all the judges is pimps
If ya weak in the game, thangs are bound to show
'cause a pimp got a stroke, and a wimp can't flow
And I ain't no muthafuckin fall guy, but Imma try hard
To let you know this pimpin ain't gone never die
M.J.G pimp tight
Young black nigga, no wife
No children, just hoes
Supplying the muthafuckin nation wit a dose
Of what, has been injected and now it's on
The muthafuckin pimp is in the house

Eightball & MJG,"Good morning, class
This is your teacher, MJG
Look at me as I write my name on the board
Class, do you see my name?
Do you understand my name?

Well, listen
Okay
Class, today at Break-A-Bitch University
We will teach young bustas, playa-hatas
And all of these weak, narrow-minded young sissies
How to break a bitch
Now 
Really, it's so easy

Mister G, I have a question
Yes?
Pimpology today is different than it was in the 70s
Aha
I wanna know how can anybody stroll today 
And if so, what proceeds do we have to go through?

Well, check it out 
First here's what you have to do

{MJG:}
It's time to let the p-I-m-p in the fuckin front do'
One mo' nigga cuttin paper on the down low
It's so twisted in this white man's society
Why it be hard for a nigga when he try to be
Independent, on his own with a plan
You hate it cause you can't understand how I can
Rearrange and change how your daughter was raised
And teach her how to constantly get paid when she's laid
Ain't no use in bein the freak of the city, you still ain't got no ducats
You want a rolex or ride buckets?
Bitch, listen cause you gots plenty of competition from these other hoes 
Who think that you supposed 
To fall dead, short, lame to the game
Don't worry, put them bitches in your pistol range
MJ fuckin G settin your mind free with the type of knowledge
Class has started, day number one in Break-A-Bitch College

And today, class
We have a guest speaker, Mister Fat Mac
Please introduce yourself...

Good evening, players, good evening
Eightball the Fat Mac here
I'm here to let you know
That these bitches, mean these bustas no good
You see what I'm sayin?
Now first of all, class
Are there any questions?

Ah yes, Mister Eightball
You bein a Professor of Pimpology
Tell me how these niggas let these hoes
Get em caught up in that fuck shit

Alright buddy, check this out...

{Eightball:}
Once again here I come pushin that funk into your ear
Do you recall Eightball, the player of the year
Calm cause I'm cool, and I'm cool cause I'm calm
Leavin hoes shell-shocked like they fall in Vietnam
Mayn, some have game, but most of them can't handle this
Those that I think are stars, end up bein scandalous
Welfare recipients, crib full of rugrats
Boost a couple of shirts, and now the bitch think she all that
Freakazoids have a nigga noid steppin up to me
Hoes that'll fuck you fast might be packin H.I.V.
Me, I'm packin jimmy hats 
So a hoe won't give me that
Shit about she on the pill 
Knowin that her pussy kill
See, through my education illustrations were the key
See, where I'm from only bustas have to pay a fee
Now you might ask what can a nigga do to get started
Pull a hoe and go enroll in Break-A-Bitch College

Ah yeah 
Now that was a very nice lecture
And as I walk back over to the middle of the bulletin board
I - I kinda figured, I wondered to myself
And I looked at my class, and I
It seems that you have more questions
Is there any more questions?

Yes
Yes, Mister MJG
I have a question
Yes?
Ah - in 94
Do you think - ah
Any bitches are gonna come up?
Can - can any bitches be pimps?

Look here, look here
Let me tell you...

{MJG:}
Now these bitches got a lotta game for a nigga, so
That made me try to see how to break a hoe
What exactly would it take for me to make the bitch click
How damn quick could I make the bitch break a trick 
How fuckin long will it take to make my profit
And what kinda justice can this hoe do for my pocket
Talkin space-age pimpin, similar to the oldies
In ways like keepin our business tight, not by tryina be Goldie
These niggas gettin they game picked down to the bone
If you listen on what these hoes have to say, your money's gone
Nigga, focus on your own rhyme, make em follow your own rules
Don't be a fool, nigga, bring that bitch on by to school
I got a class for that ass, and it stars at seven
'I was a pimp' at ten o'clock, break till eleven
Future looks good for the smartest
Niggas in the school of Sir Break-A-Bitch College

Okay class, okay class
Everybody just needs to settle down
Everybody just settle down
We're gonna break in about 15 minutes
But we have one more lecture, one more lecture
Now ehm, eh 
Calm down, calm down
I'm gonna take one more question
I'm gonna take -
Are there any more questions?

Ah yeah - ah
I wanna know 
How can a ordinary busta like me 
You know, you know
...get in Break-A-Bitch College?

{Eightball:}
Not long ago I grew up as a youngster in this shit
When all I wanted to do is stick my dick up in a bitch
That dope made my ends, and my ends bought me weed
And all I wanted to see was them young bitches on they knees
Uncle Sam, damn, can I get a job, see
I don't wanna sell this dope, and nope, I don't wanna get out and rob
Today I was coolin like I usually do
I met this hoe after a show that wanted to chew me and screw
Now some busta-ass nigga woulda fucked the bitch
But at Break-A-Bitch College that's called trickin off your dick
On the corner ain't no pimps, real players are low-key
I'm on the verge of a splurge, settin up shop in Tennessee
Ain't no future for the lame, ain't no love in this game
Do you fuck them hoes and trust them hoes and love em with no shame?
9 times out of 10, trick nigga, if you do
Break-A-Bitch College got a scholarship just for you

Ah yes
Damn good class, damn good class
Wonderful graduates
I love em all, I love em all

Now class
Can you all join in with me
For our school alma mater
And let's sing it
I'm proud to be an alumni
From Break-A-College
I'm proud to be...

Grab me Swisher cut it up and fill it with weed, hit that hoe
In the head, and tell her get out of my bed you damn freak
Hopped into the shower for an hour, it was hot as hell
Got dressed and ran a gold comb through my curls
Walkin out of the house slow, tellin that hoe come on let's go
First I crack up the music then, hit the switch on my six-four
Candy coated paint, got the bitches at the bus stop sick
But at the same time on my dick, thick
Beat a bitch quick I'm sick, full of Swishers and malt liquor

Eightball & MJG,"One nigga found dead in the bayou 
That's the beginning of this story that I'm telling you 
I was in the 9 tre smokin' a spliff on the strip 
Seen a little cutie with some bootie, stop to shoot the shit 
She was on my dick cause in the hood  I had a little rank 
She was the kind of ho tryin' to take a nigga for his bank 
But what she did not know  a nigga had a plan for that 
Take her out to dinner then knock that ass up in my Cadillac 
All of a sudden, my beeper started buzzin' on the side of me 
The code read 33, I knew it was MJG 
Step to the mobile phone, G was talkin' crazy 
This ho heard some niggas say them laws are out to get me 
That night, I was dumpin' that bitch in the ditch 
Did not know that I was doin' it in the presence of a snitch 
Got dope from the scenery, thinkin' I was scot-free 
And now, I'm ducki'n and dodgin' tryin' to keep it low-key 
Spliffed-out, ridin' in my hooptie on cloud 9 
Doin' about 50 when a nigga pass 1-Time 
Now they got a nigga faced-down on the sidewalk 
Talkin' all that punk ass rookie pig cop talk 
What was in my pocket, grabbin all my money and my beeper 
Ramblin' through my car, the pigs found my 9mm 
Now, I'm in the county callin' G to come and get me 
Wandering who is the snitch callin' these laws tryin' to sell me out 
Oh no! My mind is getting paranoid 
A nigga can't even trust his own homeboys 
As a result, I'm always alone 
except for some of the hoes I bone 
Most of the time, I watch the news while I get my smoke on 
Thousands after thousands on a lawyer who ain't doin' shit 
Locked up in this house a nigga 'bout to have a fuckin' fit 
Last night, I seen my face on the news G 
Some nigga who worked for me, slipped and lost an uzi 
Now, I'm on the run, livin' like a fugitive 
I thought to myself on the run ain't no way to live 
I thought I'd party hard and smoke and drank this century 
Now, I'm slowly dyin in this penetentery
No mercy, nigga",No Mercy,1994
Eightball & MJG,"[ VERSE 1: 8Ball ]
Tell me what's goin on, damn, I need help to see
I have chains on my brain from the strain of the
Mental corruption eruptin through this industry
All I see is New York rappers back and forth on BET
See, I'm the first true southern funkadelic preacher
Drink a 'yac and smoke a blunt and watch it get deeper
But not so deep I have to perpetrate to gain respect
Instead of judgin me you need to get yourself in check
And I'm not gonna be the want to-be you want to see
Oh no, I cannot sell my soul

[ VERSE 2: MJG ]
MJG for the Nine-Fo, what's it gonna be?
Another year for the p-i-m-p in the street
Yes, it's me, the one who clocks when it's time to get explicit
It's comin from the truth when I kick it
So dear critic, you thinkin on terms of how it needs to be
I'm tellin you how it is and what I has to live and what I got to give
To the ears of the ones who want to listen
Some don't understand,, so they really don't know what they're missin
Hard times made hard heads in the South
You get respect bein real, no sell-out

In '93 I was rappin about my curls and my Cadillac
The pimp blast, takin you fast, smokin grass and all that
Players got the message, busters didn't attempt to listen
Thinkin that we was talkin about that on-the-corner fake pimpin
Hell yeah, I'm that player from the underground
All-black assassin from the neighborhood of Orange Mound
They don't understand, why, they being society
The white people who run this nation got somethin against me
Me bein a young black male with an education
Teachin this pimpin, so the blacks will one day rule this nation
But every day another brother tries to kill me
Jack me because of the poverty in communities
Where you either have to sell crack or jack, man
What I'm tryin to stress to you is, don't step to the fat man
Because today I'm rappin, rockin shows and pullin hoes
But tomorrow I might be on the cut slingin dope
See, in the studio I'm killin fools vocally
But if it came down to it, I could do it silently
Fuck the President, the media can quote me
Listen to them lyrics, fool, I ain't sellin out, gee

[ VERSE 4: MJG ]
You gotta be hard in this business, ain't no suckers, ain't no sell-outs
It's the way that you go in it, that's the way you gonna go out
First of all: never break up with them hustlers that you started with
Long as this happens you and your click won't accomplish sh...
Should've thought about it real hard
Now how could any group that's meant to be together be apart?
And if you start with a strong mind, think with a strong mind
be	-you-s-i-n-e-ss time
I'm in the lab, chiefin hay, comin up with gold
Pimp mobile, hit the reel, let the platinum roll
See, I was taught, not the easy, but the hard way
Hustle after hustle after hustle each and every day
I gotta stay down to earth, cause I'm from Orange Mound
See, that's my hood, understood in the M-Town
Memphis-bound players, pimp type, black, strong, young 
Level-headed Tennesseee, hustlers got it goin on
Bad to the bone when I roam through the area

I quench my thirst today

And then I'm thanking god once again for making everything all right

See, my partners who used to ride with me 
And smoke that dank, and fuck with hoes 
Would they be them same niggas if I didn't have shit to roll? 
Maybe they will, maybe they won't 
Who is to say what a nigga will do 
Who is to say if you help someone it's guaranteed that they'll help 
You 
See what I'm sayin', listen to me and see if you can dig this 
Smilin' faces replaces friends when people receive ends 
Now all of a sudden I'm actin' funny because my moneys loaned 
But there was no drama when I was livin' at my momma's home 
But I'm not tellin' a nigga nothin' you don't already know 
Personal business, you got to watch who you friends is 
I'm thinking about hard times 
Freeing my mind 
Who in the fuck goin' be my crutch? 
Holdin' me up, helpin' me out 
Makin' sure that I stay in touch 
Where do I sleep, who do I turn to? 
When I be low on my cash 
Who am I down with when fifty niggas be talkin' bout kickin' my ass? 
Who is my friends who is my foes? 
Who do I ask, when I want to know 
Somethin' about somethin' but I don't know nothin' 
My ignorance be keepin' me out in the cold 
Who do I call when I'm in need of a ride? 
In somebody elses car 
How do I get from point A to be	 if be is just to far? 
Where can I get a loan, where can I use the phone? 
Who's goin' to give me the permission to make a decision 
To come up in they house and live 
When will I drive a BMer takin' my clothes to the cleaner 
How can I know 
Will I forever be payin' my dues, will I forever be singing the blues? 
Where will I find a shoulder when I be wantin' to lean 
Know what I mean? 
When I be needin' some justification 
Stuck in the fuckin' same location 
Who is the friend that is helpin' me? 
Who is the busta that's hurtin' me? 
Who can I trust? 
Will you be there when the goin' is tough? 
Will I be hangin' with dick in the dust? 
Who want to share my load when it's too heavy to carry? 
Or will I go crazy pullin' the load alone? 
Constantly gettin' my hustle on 
When will I finally see, kinda suspect 
Or even actually know 
Who is my real friend thick and the thin? 
And who in the fuck is the foe? 
Friend or foe, you just will never know 
Who can you trust, in a world that's oh so cold 
Playa hatin' is everywhere I go 
Friend or foe you just will never know",Friend or Foe,1995

Because my ride is awaiting our date and
Of steak and a night cap
We mating, awaking
By smells of perfume that I inhale
And then tell how well we raise hell on the dizzell
Satin sheets
Heat from your feet keep me warm
The mood is perfected by sounds from the storm
You came stronger, I lasted longer
Than I've ever lasted, your mouth was fantastic
The fuck test, you passed it
The way you made a nigga laugh, I had to getcha
And when I saw that ass pass, I had to hit cha
Ya making me fight against my will, what must I do
Would ya kill for me, ya if my life in danger too
Even steal for me, ya if that shit belongs to you
Then feel for me, ya if the way you act is true
Who knows, fine clothes
Lexus doors you'll be closing, when you become one of the chosen
Hoes in different places, different faces
Different cases, got me tied like shoe laces
No mistake this MJG, you ain't gotta be
Constantly trying to shoot that P, claiming that you ain't heard of me

Eightball & MJG,"[Tela] 
It was this bitch that I knew back from '86 
Graduated and made it from the college of dicks 
Now who the fuck you be, bitch you know me 
Tryin' to act solo, down low, hush-hush, and lo-key 
 
Nah hoe I ain't po', where did my motherfuckers go 
I remember this hoe, she used to do nails for Rochelle's, well 
How the hell you been since I had no job 
Hum, why don't you give me some 
 
'Cause you know I flow and run for Suave 
Nah, all of that was on the couch 
No doubt why y'all records spin, why y'all shippin' in gold 
It's cold On The Outside lookin' in (brrrr!) 
 
You'd best a make yourself worthy 
Cause I got a click of niggas ready to get their johnson very dirty 
You heard me push these thirty dicks, inside your pearly clit 
Ain't this a bitch 

I remember when you would not give me shit 
Now you down for them habits 
Put your numbers on them naturals 
Make it snappy cause I got to go to the bathroom 
 
[Chorus] 
Hoes with no clothes sure enough
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what? 
Hoes with no clothes sure enough 
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what? 
Hoes with no clothe sure enough 
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what? 
Hoes with no clothes sure enough 
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?, Suave love 
 
[Eightball] 
No different from the rest 
She's just an ordinary hoe 
Hair extensions, long nails, ass thicker than gumbo 
Make it fast, takin' cash, shakin' ass in the mix 
 
Tens turn to twenties and twenties come from plenty tricks 
Niggas in love 
Can't stay out the club 
All in the hoe's face 
But at the end of the paper chase, whatever you had will be erased 
 
I see him in the back 
Countin' up that cheddar 
Talkin' loud, smokin' hay, makin' clouds, gettin' ready for the crowd 
I think I know one 
 
I remember you, oh yes I do 
Tryin' to hide side from me and my crew, but ain't no love lost boo 
What time the club close, at 3 
What's up, you comin' with me 

We can smoke up mad trees after you get up off your knees 
You want some cheese 
Hoes don't stay at the suave house 
Hoes around my nuts like knots 
 
Real dogs don't pay for cats, that's 
For real baby 
Recognize and sho me love, dig that shit, sure enough 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[MJG] 
Well I be God damned, this shy ass hoe 
Wants to get close to me 
A few years back in the past, you wouldn't of even noticed me 
Quoting the, lyrics of the songs that you know I flow 
 
Lookin' for, confidants, and tickets to my next show 
Check yo' bitch 
In these short ass pants and blow up dresses 
I can tell they freaky with out three guesses 
 
Oh yes it's very true 
Your bitches be needin' me, leavin' you 
Hell, now what the fuck is a nigga like me supposed to do 
Let her loose or let her remain 

'Cause all she be lookin' for is some fame 
A bigger name 
Look, this thang with bigger game 
And she claim she ain't heard my music 
 
Tryin' to trick me 
So I told that hoe my name Bill Bigsley 
She still hit me 
Now she, killin' my dick softly with her mouth and I 
 
Really just don't plan on takin' it out cause I 
MJ fuckin' G you needs to knows 'bout these hoes shakin' 
They ass with no clothes like some pros, sure enouogh

Eightball & MJG,"Verse One: MJG 
Here comes the one they call the P.I. M.P. 
Straight out the cut no one can see I bust these 
Way out of touch with all them bustas in my rear view 
but see they game so lame I can hear through 
I Hens doggin at the bar actin real nice (real nice) 
Six pack of Hen straight up with no ice tap me twice 
Did you really want my full attention? 
Sometimes my mind (intertwine) with the tenth dimension 
I see you inchin to my ride, tired, rest them legs 
Soon as you open up your mouth (uhh) there's the head 
Now who I be, MJG, certified, mic controller 
(Uncle Sam, I want you!) Trick bend over 
I'm a petrified rapper talkin, and you ain't nuttin 
but an electrified shyster walkin, I'm tired of savin 
people from takin these dead end trips, I'ma just go 
and bust this champagne upside your ship, alright you hip? 
You in a hurry? You can't relate? 
Don't ever say that I ain't try to set it to you straight 
I'm out the gate before you hate but I'll be back again 
You saw me faintly through the crowd but now I'm in the wind 
Once again 
Chorus: Eightball and MJG 
In the wind, it's a bird, it's a plane 
Now it be them hustlers with that skin tight game 
In your mix, scopin you, scopin me 
Eightball and MJG to the end, bustas we in the wind 
Verse Two: Eightball 
I sold my soul to this hustle, homeboy scratch what you heard 
T front me a keyboard, I flipped it like a bird, word 
on them streets be them Suave House beats 
In the Benz blowin Sweets got your gal between my sheets 
Speak -- I ain't have to say one little thang 
The fame of my name blew the ghetto freak brain 
Lookin for a meal ticket, she let me stick it 
Wicked when she lick it, tryin to make me trick it 
Girl, when I was broke it seemed all about the luxury 
Now I got cheese, I got a pay a girl to love with me 
But I'm a jelly worker, like Smuckers 
Workin against them suckers, big facin just to love a 
broad that done been around the world in a day 
Bear lovin whoever got cheddar to pay 
Ball like no trick ass, them shakers if I tip 
I be drunk, in the club, smokin sticky cat nip 
Slip, as if a banana peel was dropped in my path 
into a body bodyworkin not discussin no math 
Playa haters all around me as I stumble and grin 
Snatch my vest, twist somethin, hit the rumble and then... 
Chorus 2X 
Verse Three: MJG, Eightball 
I flip scripts on young dips who think they hip 
Smoke up your whole zip, sess hydro or crip 
Time and time again, stories have been told 
About the super hustler dyin tryin to get the gold 
Concrete jungle full of, carnivorous firearm 
Hunger for flesh, and pray on who ain't strong 
Heavy weighters, with plenty hoes that buy em alligators 
In the wind, breakin all big ? 
Pick artificial tricks stolen money makers 
Money trees come in please, help a player shake a 
million down to the ground, feel them hits fall 
Ride with me I'll run your game into a brick wall, trick y'all 
is what this false literary do, then reality come 
(and snatch the natural dust out you) who speaks the truth? 
Whose your leeches? Whose your friends? 
I plan to bring the realness back again, but until then 
I'm in the wind 
Chorus 4X",In the Wind,1997
Eightball & MJG,"No one expected the unexpected (uh uh)
Nawumsaying?  
Something real, something you could feel (that's right)
Straight from the Suave House (Bad Boy)
Representing (no doubt)
Put a little soul in here
And we don't stop

No one has to ask who be actin' bad 
Eightball and MJ pimpin' G be all up in that ass 
From Memphis Tenn, around the world and than back again 
Make non-rappin' weak MC's go home practicing 
I flip a Benz, will Lorenzo play and plenty Benjamins 
Low key, plenty ends makes plenty friends 
Baby, I got all the herbs that I need to chief 
Smoke up a pound and leave you bitch niggas in disbelief 
Inhale the smoke and every word I wrote came out dope 
Not like that crack, I being lyrical dope above tracks 
Not sayin' I won't pull the Rueger and put hollow to ya 
Have yo mama on her knees screamin' Hallelujeh 
Lay it down playa, Suave House, Bad Boy, Fat Boy 
And her friends the Rat-A-Tat boy
Matter of fact boy, this is not a act boy 
The player way, keep the player makin' stacks boy 

Everything that I do be all about the loot 
I been kickin' up dust in my Polo boots 
Gettin' blowed on the droll, takin' smoke up my nose 
I give the world to a woman, but I don't love hoes 
I'm a player, baby and don't you forget 
You need to get with it, let me hit it and split it 
In the bed, on the floor, hot tub, everyday 
The player way, the player way 

Now on, on, break o' dawn, can't stop, I'm too hot 
Look shit, my niggas rock, hype man be in the drop 
Me no care if the B's be tinted, you won't see me in it 
'Less there's TV's in it 
I can tell by the way you talk and the way you chit-chat 
You foul and if you had styles you wouldn't get back 
You thinkin' you invincible, you ain't hard to get at 
I know everywhere you go, everywhere you live at 
I be wanna click-clack and you be ready to get back 
I be ready to go to war, you ain't gon' be with that 
You be the same cat that I run up on and spit at 
Bleedin' all crazy and don't know where you hit at 
I'm dead up, niggas doin' drama better shut up, I'm fed up

Now drop yo drawers
And do something outstandin' with yo jaws
After all this waitin' I can see clean through yo forehead 
You mo' said than done, give mo' head than some 
Throw my jacket down in the puddle, hell no 
If you don't know a pimp, somebody besta tell y'all 
Yeah the women say it's good to have a confidant 
But yet and still they give it up to pimps, once a month 
See a lot of these pimp lovers, they took they K-man 
Front like they real and hold a fake in 
You wastin' the time 
Serious ballas and ready hoes, got da women walkin' 
Dibs on da strip with steady toes 
As I pull up, cranking is thinking the bigger fat, natural expertise 
Plenty money workin' for G and whoever next to me 
And I ain't gonna rest till we made a statement

Eightball & MJG,"I'm MJG the nigga with the versatile style 
Check your calendar realize that I been here for awhile 
When I was young I took the soul up out of rhythm and blues 
When hip hop originated slowly paid my dues 
And take my shoes and try to walk a mile in my past 
Without them salt shaker sheisters tryin to get in that ass 
It's been too long you motherfuckers fittin to feel the south 
Shut your mouth, shut your do you little freak ass hoe 
I'm bout tired of all this damn east and west coast shit 
Especially when other niggaz tryin to work in this bitch 
I paid my dues to the fullest, worked to god damn hard 
For you too kill the industry and leave me out of a job 
You niggaz strain yourself, to maintain yourself 
And now you playin with enough rope to actually hang yourself 
But you don't care, hell, you constantly fallin deep in the plot 
Mesmerized from all the bitches and the money you got 
You must of forgot they said that rap would never last ten years 
And if your selfish to the fact, I'm tryin to have a career 
Now listen here, what do we have, we got probable cause 
To keep the pen on the paper and the glock in your drawers, nigga 

Remember back when we used to do this shit for fun 
Bein the dopest on my block made me ranked number one 
No gun, just a pen and notebook paper by the sheet 
In the crib, gettin funky off the next nigga beat 
No electronics to make the shit that I wrote the chronic 
Shit sick enough to bring vomit from your stomach 
Quick as a comet, shield your eyes from the UV 
Groovey, like a nigga from a Batman movie 
Real about the shit that I express over dope beats 
You can't say it was fake unless you grew up on my street 
Concrete head niggaz, runnin from FED niggaz, 
Po' ass scared niggaz, that came out dead niggaz 
And all I ever wanted to be was an emcee 
Did a little dirt and found it wasn't for me 
Poetry flowin through my bloodstream like a drug 
I'm addicted to rhyme because I love the buzz, nigga 
 
My reason for rhyme 
Because I'm true to this rap

Because I'm real with this rap

My reason for rhymin, while I'm in, a position to be tellin 
It's not about the fame and them bitches who be yellin 
At my concerts, one verse, dicks up, quick fuck 
Lies start spreadin now you tangled in a mix up 
I gits up, do sits up, and squeeze my mental mindrame back in order 
And use my hand as a tape recorder 
Jottin down all the information placed in front of me 
The good time, the bad time, the way I think it oughta be 
Now follow G, can you comprehend? 
If you can then drink a shot of Hen 
Hit this hand on your silver end 
Friends don't be friends and foes don't be foes 
However the way you bring it, that's how you want it, I suppose 
I can stay up out the game keep my aim on my paper 
And I'll be sure to keep my pimpin real with Tony Draper 
And I'll potray the man that I'm known to be

Give me a crowd of wild niggaz who love real hip hop 
And watched smoke get soaked up, like water in a mop 
Drop presidents among me and my own folk 
And let that bullshit walk among the past with ghosts 
Ain't no hope of bein takin seriously 
When limited avenues are given to me 
So, naturally I take shit and make shit mine 
Jackin only for position in this thing called rhyme 
Freestyle, not great, but if you wait for a second 
I could write some shit down that could get a gold record 
Thought about not the first thing that I think about 
MJG and Eightball and hard is how we comin out 
Runnin out, niggaz who can't hold on like En Vogue 
Even though I moved out the mound I'm still ten toed 
Down for the shit I do, the Suave House crew

I raise up with all the game that I've been holdin back 
Take your pumps off bitch let me check out yo heals 
We pimps from Houston Texas to California for real 
My pockets hurtin baby I need some financial love 
So get where you supposed to and, do 
What you does, get your facial done baby 
Do your physic well, no holdin jail over 
Resent mail, no hoes with no clothes 
Torn up and ripped apart

Hustlin, don't be afraid 

[Verse 2 ]
I'm creatin' havok on hood spots 
The hustle don't quit until the good stop 
But don't sleep we leavin' cars on wood blocks 
An lookin for could be nots drivin by lookin wide-eyed 
Gone acid washed jeans T-shirt lookin tyedyed 
FM beats lettin loose on big trips to Vegas 
Candy green polly dubbed nips lookin outrageous 
Big pimpin and panderin, big boostin and gamblin 
Everything is all good until police start manhandlin 
Picture me grappled, scrappled, snatched up by yo asshole 
Indicted on some chump charges that I didn't even ask for 
Gettin hastled by wild boys, like gettin lassoed by cowboys 
Any instructions given he put some more shit on like, now boy 
Like I'm supposed to jump out my Nikes and start sweatin 
Boss said anything, I'm makin the plan to start jettin off 
Oo- ah don't look behind until my shoes stop 
The only thing on my mind is losin you cop 

Chorus 
Verse 3 
Someone's knockin at my door, oh, who could it be 
Big baller with the sawed off choppin off all below your knees 
I testify, not glorify, when I get high 
Tell all that listen what I see through my blood shot eyes 
My peers they die, why, over they set they ride on cheddar cheese 
On they knees, how, one to the head behind them keys 
I dip through, the town on a rocket ship sittin on twinkie 
Smokin sticky, and breathin until my breathe get stinky 
Pops that pinky, never could seem to get his shit together 
Ran like DMC, left me livin thougher than leather, teenage eyes 
Soakin up the streets like a sponge, drugs and guns 
And freakin hoes seemed to be so fun, from the beginnin 
I've been sittin tryin to be winnin, dissin bitches 
Fuckin hoes, conversatin with women, workin out 
Pimp ass nigga since my day of birth, its in my blood nigga 
I'm gonna hustle till I leave this earth 

Chorus 
Verse 3 
Nigga, it's in my blood to fuck around with these thugs 
Straight villans, drug dealin, 38 snuff consume niggas buck pealin 
I love millions, plus stackin them chips on up to the ceiling 
Sittin on fat like banks, wit out no scratch and no dank 
We gettin bank, to set it off like Jada Pinkett 
In a major way, just witness, business flossin 
Boss playas kickin champagne wishes before this rap business 
Playas I went from rags to riches 
To havin cash and bad ass bitches 
Since day one, yo nigga been slangin that A-1 yola 
Hit ups savings, for razor blades and bakin soda, paper 
Chasin, usin V-12 to swell up the cola, baby just shakin 
Turnin the liquid form into bolas, I Chef like Raekwon 
Those friends that want to blaze 
One come over, dropped the napalm, until you scream 
Straight cream on up, coughin up they lungs they come back screamin 
For more when it's over, slangin these head rhymes to young soldiers 
These ??? known as hustlers, nigga

I'm the MJG pimp tight 
Put it to the floor 5 0 swang a right 
In a pina butta guts is a must 
Drivin' in the shop take a mile grab em up 
Paint a ten clear coats to make it shine 
Make me circle through the neighborhood 55 times 
With my gas tank full, drank a boor 
Fall up in the park after dark try to pull 
Me a young, stout woman, sumpin' pretty 
Nice round hills, with them wear shaped titties 
As the sun goes down, I'm gettin' dirty 
Fall up and press a word get cleaned in a hurry 
In my 77 Chevy, ass tight 
Pull off cuttin' rubber, disappearin' in the night 

Just like candy (candy) 
Just like candy 
Its the same feeling (looks good to me) 

Ten o'clock in the morning, his A got up 
Chief and Haywood some cool-Aid in my favorite cup 
Comb my hair, get my grill right so I can feel tight 
Havin' starch in my jeans and a fresh pair of Nikes 
As I strike, out the door, to my superb 
Parked by the curb, candy coated bird 
The sun got my candy lookin' good enough to eat 
You can tell by the way the girls act across the street 
Hit the horn, but no stallin', keep ballin' 
4 o'clock Sunday, I gotta hit the mall and 
Fall in full of them green trees 
Hurry up so I can catch Martin Luther King 
Fools all in the way with that econo-spray 
Need to take a few classes, learn about Manassas 
Pressure got me beamed, I'm talkin' on the phone 
Tellin' Penny that's the way to do it, baby represent ya home 

Just like candy (candy) 
Just like candy (It takes over me) 
Its the same feeling (looks good to me) 

Mechanical to pain will bring flavors to your mind 
And in the summertime we got the whole block blind 
Some busta in a primed out Pinto poppin' game 
Lying sayin' he goin' get the same thang 
If you ain't ridin' wood, and leather, your ride ain't hittin' 
A plane dash for a crush, forever got you itchin' 
99.95, 30 day paint jobs 
Got niggaz ridin' round lookin' like a junk yard 
You need to pull a check, wheeler check, wheeler check 
Stack up on your grip, get your shit sprayed wet 
See most of these new paint jobs they don't do 
But if it ain't candy then the job ain't true 
 
Its reserved for them ballaz, who make that cheese 
It ain't candy if it didn't cost a couple of G's 
On your Jeep, your truck, your Chevy or your Lexus 
5th wheel on the grill like them playaz do in Texas 
My folks gettin' sideways in Vallejo 
Ballaz in Memphis slammin' shut the Cadillac doors 
Full of ink so blinked I could fly 
To a world where you have to roll candy or you die 
Descending, my mind goes back into reality 
To some, having candy paint is just a fantasy 
Custom leather everywhere you look is woodgrain'

TSRight right right right
8BOne time
TSBeyotch
8BYeah, you know how they like it baby, nigga you can't retire

From nineteen-eighty, through eighty-eight
I Don't Stop Rappin like my first tapes
When I was broke, I used to sell em instantly (instantly)
One look, you could tell it was the pimp in me (pimp in me)
In eighty-nine, I went on tour with Eazy-E (Eazy-E)
A bunch of fine bitches tryin to sleep with me
Every night, sold out, turnin young hoes
Tell her baby, no doubt, stick this dick in yo' mouth
I smoked a lot of weed, I said a lot of rhymes
Always fucked up in niggaz bitches all the time
Now I'm ridin on twenties wearin nice clothes
But ain't nuttin like pimpin hoes, and ridin Vogues
I live a good life, in my pursuit of happiness
I'm so glad, to get to the point of havin this
Opportunity, for you and me to pass it on
Two years ago, I thought it'd be my last song

Me, Squeaky, Flex and J, on Saratoga Street
Smokin white boys, bumpin dopefiend beats
Eighty-eight, my pockets wasn't straight, but I was makin it
Niggaz like Lil' Tim was out there ballin sellin cakes n shit
I was right there, on the Mob Circle, writin raps
All about my snaps, tryin to put Ball and G on the map
Nowadays I own my shit and bone bad bitches
Kickin it with rich niggaz in rollers, and candy sixes
Deliverin hot shit like Pizza Hut for them hardcore thugs
Niggaz who pimp bitches and hit the highway with them drugs
Feel my flow, mix it in witcha chronic main
$Hort Dawg, I don't know why you tryin to leave this game
State to state, plenty hoes and plenty money to make
Writing raps, makin more than them niggaz movin weight
The game been good to me, and I know that muhfucka bless you
Thanks for passin game, now let's get out here and make this loot

TSI won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
TSI got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
8BWe some presidential players, with money by the layers
8BAin't nuthin you broke ass niggaz do that can fade us
TSI won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
TSI got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
MJI drive fast cars, eat lunch by lakes
MJand meet a hundred different bitches when I drop new tapes

I had to sacrifice, get things right
In this rap life, I paid my dues
Learn how to crawl, before I walk
Then I learned how to tie my shoes
Tryin crime, but it just didn't work for me
Matter of fact it did it worse for me
Gettin eyes scarred, bein weak one time ya hard
It can only do hurt to me
So I sucked up my peer pressure, and my pride
And realized that this rap shit was gon help me to survive
Stay alive, go with the flow but don't be no muhfuckin fool
Hell this music thing is all I got, I ain't makin straight A's in school
And ain't wind up to be dumber nigga, only to be different
So all the shit that you think we are, the shit that we isn't
When you raised up, where I come from, make it out is a blessing
Cause half the cats, where I come from, don't ever learn they lessons
My first love, even before I had a daughter, or a lady
Was rappin, sweet lyrics, I love you, my baby
MJG, what you see, on TV, is fame
But the rapper I let loose almost anything, I love this game

I won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
I make too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
I live the fast life of a MC
And I sell a lot of records makin pimp beats
I could do a show tonight and make ten G's
Fuck til the mornin, sleep late and smoke weed
Three cars in my garage, truck in the driveway
I always, get my dick sucked on the highway

My way (pimp til I dieee) fuck a hoe
Unless that hoe is breakin me off some dough, to hit the studio
Blowin, niggaz ain't knowin, how far this shit is goin
I wrote all my shit, but niggaz always talkin bout what I owe them
But I'm gon' show them, real niggaz stand on they own ten toes
So I'ma make all the money, and try my best to fuck all these hoes
Friend or foe, a bitch or hoe, rich or po'

I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times
I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times (hard, times)
I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times
I'm tryin' to make it through these hard times (hard, times)
Hard times (hard), hard times (hard)

You never know how much you miss a person, until they gone
Like to hear it? Hear it go, I'm rehearsing, gotta sing my song
I know I've done some wrong, but I can't get right
Cause life is like a big fight
I'm stickin'-and-movin', tryin' to get my shit right
My family's been houndin' me, friends they done turned against me
Kinda like they hearts was on a full tank, but now they empty
And they say I've changed, but like twins I'm just the same
It's because of my job, mo' money mo' prob in this dirty game
This industry fucked up
That's right I said it, and it's fake as ever
Keep real niggas around me, stay ""Space Age 4 Eva""
Poppa never went and jumped the broom, never got that one degree
But if you looked down from heaven, you'd still be proud of me
Your son was DUI, but my momma made it by
I didn't shed no tears when you left me
but the rest of the family cried
Trials and tribulations, ruined my concentration
Losin my patience, hard times for goodness sake'n

[Chorus]

As this Valium slowly starts to kick in
Them subconscious, subliminal thoughts, start tickin'
This whole world around me, diseased, and crumblin'
Babies doin' dope cause daddy did it right in front of them
Everybody wanna blame music for they bad kids
Sittin' up in the court talkin' 'bout Eminem made me do what I did
My own hard times rolled in like the fog
Try to think of others, but I can't get past my own thoughts
My momma, in 1967, pickin' cotton
While other blacks was gettin' liberated, boycottin'
My old man was a player, ain't no hidin' that
He started tootin' then he graduated to smokin' crack
I never saw him, never needed to see that muh'fucker
He left me and my mother stuck down here in this fuckin' gutter
I tattooed it on my arm so I can't forget it
It's in my mind and my heart so I'm forever with it

[Chorus]

A drum machine, the old fo'-track, and a pack of new tapes
In the middle of, 1988, in a corner cafe
We made beats, and hung with old heads, and stayed out late at night
Do talent shows, fo'-way split the dough, that was our way of life
My momma stayed, home full time so she could raise me
Knowin' without a, household father, things could get crazy
Sometimes I listened, sometimes I thought I knew it all
But nevertheless, momma was with me through it all
I graduated out of nothin', not out of school, it was like
12, 13, 14 years I'm thinkin' cool
I might as well, be focusin' on me tryin' to get paid
Usin' these rhymes I've been writin' since in the 7th grade
Our team played, and had physical sex with minimum wage
It was just like a piece of pussy
It fucked me long as I stayed
But still I prayed, Lord I'm tryin' now please help me out the water
It can't get no harder
Help me to get back up and get my shit tomorrow

The name of the game is get no sleep
Mash on, niggas, and always roll deep
Non stop hustle means all profits double
Young nigga tryin' to see rocks like Barney Rubble

Vampire, circulate when the moon rise
Do dirt when most people got closed eyes
Rollin', livin' off garbage and scraps
Niggas wouldn't even fuck with me if I had rap

Thinkin' 'bout that man, that's just another trap
Another nigga dead from another nigga's strap
Space aging every thought and everything I write
Livin' for today, a nigga might die tonight

Just because a nigga think I'm a celebrity
They want to rob and jack and try to bury me
Forced entry embedded in my memory
Fightin' sleep like Freddie Kruger tryin' to get me

In the midst, I wanna see it, not hear about it
If a nigga wanna see it, gotta be about it
Can't do without it, sayin', till my life end
Every night, they like, ""Catch me up again""

You say, like daylight, it's gonna catch me up again
(Gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up again)
Some people like gettin' up when I'm just gettin' in
(It's gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up again)

I look up, I can't see the forest full of trees
Destined to make it through, regardless of the seas
Of evil that been planted, sproutin' concrete walls
So everybody has stained deals
After all, you playin wrong

Now you havin' to climb so you can make it
Got the whole roll block, and too thick for you to break it
Don't fake it, you know it's kinda hard to try to shake it
The camel's tellin' you to come on, you had to cake it

Mr. Mistake It, Mr. Do Nothing, uncle, give me something
You mouth tellin' me, love, but I ain't feelin' none, stealin' some
Same positions I've been facin' for years
Now I'm about to put some steak in this meal, inflatin' my bills

Excusin' you hoes who want fame
Using you hoes for one thang
Fuck how you changed, bitch
It's funny why you stayed around
And patience how you laid me down
Now you expectin' the crown

I'm full time, respectin' the game
Checkin' out the girls in change
A turd in the hand is far worse than a turd in commode
Let that shit float on, 'cause that shit get old

It seems that daylight is gonna catch me up again
(Gonna catch me, gonna catch me up again)
Some people like gettin' up when I'm just gettin' in
(It's gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up again)
Well, well

Eightball & MJG,"Yeah, yeah, Space Age forever; Niggas and hos better recognize 
Eightball and MJG, been ten toes down in this game 
Since we were two young playas in a one-horse town 
Then hopped to a muthafuckin' grasshopper 
Nigga, my life would have been done got cut off
If my dues weren't paid

It's a thinnin' line between wrong and right 
Trapped in a trap till the mornin' light 
Ghetto ain't left me no choices; I had to fight 
My mama and daddy was too young to raise me right
Maybe I been made a man from all the mistakes I made 
Niggas dead, niggas gone; I still ain't afraid
Ain't too grown to get back on with ghetto games I played 
My life would have been done got cut off if the dues weren't paid

In the middle of doin' crime; it never stopped me from writin' rhymes 
It never stopped me from playin' music
God, but it didn't mean I had to use it 
It was obvious: I had to give up the streets for the beats 
Not knowin', but havin' faith on just how long that it would be 
Before I made it, before somebody picked up my tape and played it 
With a remark like, ""Hey, played that instrumental, you cat's got potential."" 
In the process of doing talent shows, parties, and mix tapes 
We even put it down on some of our homeboys jail release dates 
I can remember in the past closin' down at fast foods 
Strictly stickin' to my dreams, but feelin' like I'd be the last dude 
Who can make it in this rap; I thought that they ain't gon' see me in Memphis 
It was like a time they looked over Tennessee
And didn't know hip-hop was in us
To all my vets in the game, I got love; stay on your toes 
'Cause back in the days, I used to use your 4-5 instrumental to do my shows 
And, look, I was seventeen when I signed my first contract 
And about eighteen and a half when I signed my worst contract; we hurt from that 
And till this day they still distributin' our first tape 
Before Comin' Out Hard, now can you feel it? 
Be humble and patient with whatever you should choose

Ain't too grown to get back on with ghetto games I played 
My life would have been done got cut off if the dues weren't paid

A c-note for a concert; I know that sounds preposterous 
Nigga, we didn't have a pot to piss 
So we got on stage, and we rocked the bitch

Get buck wild, start a fight; the police make a nigga stop the show

If she come with a price tag, fuck that bitch 
Why should you switch? 
From one hoe, and love 'em all

Started this shit and I'm gon' finish yes I am dammit
We gonna slam it down like to hit it, here its shitted
Here its time for them niggas in Memphis, Tenn to get deep within it
How deep? shit the devil stay right down the street
and why you mad? the rebels tied a brother by his feet
for what, for what I don't know they tied him to a pickup truck
then posted up and down like they didn't really give a fuck
I get rid of bigots with bad racial equalities
bust back at KKK's who try to follow me
these hollowties saving my ass in crucial situations
any other tactics I need, I use imagination
I'm ten steps ahead of your ass type of nigga
shit that I already know you try to figure
give up, put your ship up, don't try to sail
don't you see we got this shit built up, can't pry a nail
in my foundation my sound making too many bump all out the trunk
get crunk and blow blunts and buck jump
ain't no luck chump we come intentional with this dope shit
using a pen or a pencil back when I wrote this

fuck reconciliation, niggas don't want no unity

pain when another motherfucker try to touch me
anger when a petty player faker try to fuck me

nice with a mic and I don't think you want to fuck with me
love head doctors and I don't mean a psyciatrist
bitches with that lip grip tighter than a gorilla fist
pimp shit, when is everybody gonna learn
Pimps and gangstas make the universe turn
poverty with the right amount of hustle turns to riches
but wrong situations turn hard niggas to bitches
I was born in the war zone fought for everything I got
learned about my hustle, nigga worked and made the shit hot
hoes started jockin niggas, boppin like they bitches too

You say no
How you gone say that when you dress say yes
A saddle on yo chest I expect nothing less
Than nuts on yo neck dick on yo chin
Just like we done then last time lets do it again
It looks as if to me you got some handles bout yourself
But everything you struggle to reach is up on the shelf
In homes of pimps who done done it
Some play around with your mind we run it

Smokin' the bud.

No question, clutchin' there no more weapon, 'cause the po po wanna sweat my blessings and
Uh, you'll probably feelin? the sense of some danger, 
But I'm bringin' the sense of an angel to the table. 
Watch me put it down for mo, and them suave house niggas. 
So, willin' and ready to make a few dollars and split a few wigs . 
If that's what it is, you better be mindin' your business, or be beggin' forgiveness.

Eightball & MJG,"[Eightball talking]
Ay dawg, check this out (uh)
Peep this..
I met this lil' chick the other day (yea)
Talkin 'bout some super stout
Super stout, she put it on ya boy
Yea I promise ya, she put it on ya boy

[Eightball]
It all started in the mall
She said ""Hey, ain't you Eightball?""
I said ""I'll be whoever you want me to be""
She was fine like a supermodel, Naomi
Out to the truck me and this ho bounced
Thirty minutes later we was on my couch
Remy, X.O. and green sticky weed
She hit it like a pro, didn't choke, didn't heave
We talked for a minute, you know how shit go
Two people get close and they jump off bro
I kissed her on the back of the neck, she got wild
Beggin me to hit it doggie style
Long story short, shorty got that fire
If I tricked off, I'd trick it on her
She said she got a man, but he ain't shit
He give her everythang but love and good dick
Time went on, we kept in contact right
But never really hooked up, and never got tight
I wish I coulda got with her one more time
Then maybe, I woulda never wrote this rhyme

[Hook - Eightball] 2x
She's always on my mind - I want to be with her
She's always on my mind - But I can't be with her
She's always on my mind - I want to be with her
She's always on my mind - But I can't be with her

[MJG]
She was 5'6, redbone and lye chick
Ain't no way she could disguise it
When her eyes hit, my eyes, it was a trance in it
Only thang that I was thinkin was in her pants
She was holdin my wood with a tight fist
I whispered, into her ear ""I know you like this""
She said ""I'm ridin wit'chu"" Damn right bitch!
I'm a pimp and I ain't got all night shit
I got a reserve ticket for a ho want to kick it
Get down lick it, 'cause I'm feelin you down wit it
She was certified, equipped with pussy grip
I ain't buyin a bitch a room, I'll fuck her off in my whip
Feel my rib-tipped, that triple bit Trojan
Fo' den hunnie, it's up in ho land
Up to the windowsill, knockin it off
Then I stuck it in your grill, I'll beat it up
Seein as how you, treated me - Knowin that I was pimpin
Before I understood what it meant, I broke women
MJG, breakin 'em in - mentally and physically
Mind, body, and money - shimmy shimmy

[Chorus] 2x

[MJG]
She was always right there, on the tip of my mind
Makin me look at other women blind
Every motherfuckin time I find myself lookin for a phone number
I'm gone, I'm alone, I want that women
When I see her, I'ma let her know how I feel about her
Be a pimp tight, real nigga with skills outta town
Lookin for the one that got me hypnotized
Hips and thighs, glimpsin eyes, trippin now
Go'on the same, ready to knock it off friend
When she admit it's time, I'm lock it in
Head straight to the hood, and snatch a six-pack
Tell the folks that I'm with, that I'ma get back
I think her name was uhh.. shit I can't remember
But I know she was a cute, lil', stout tender
Ready to put it down, whether rain or shine
She always, always, always..

[Chorus] 4x

[MJG whispering] 4x
She's always on my mind.. always on my mind
She's always on my mind.. always on my mind

Creep up from behind you
And leave you with some heat that will always remind you

Yo' wife wanna leave out

Bout that real shit and bout these shady ass hoes
I hit the block when I was 12 and I ain't never leavin'
Kept a grip and kept on tippin' right through drought season
Never been a hater even at my lowest level
Some niggaz get some change and sell they soul to the Devil
I'm drinkin' Dom, man I'm chiefin' on some green sticky
Space Age Pimpin' and my real niggaz rollin' with me

We broke the mold, ain't no duplicatin' the two
Who makin' hit shit in clutch situations
And demonstratin' the real quality of a team which consists of
Eightball & MJG, we do this shit 'cause it feel good
First of all, we sacrificed for it
But afford it, then motherfuckers sheist for it

Ain't no regret but scars from my battlin' hard tactics

I saw you on the front page

Saw some shit fall and seen a lot of shit grow
Money here, money gone like a magic trick
Real hustlers hustle with or without that shit
I get my grind on daily 'cause I wanna see
Me and my niggaz gettin' paid 'til we elderly
And it ain't hard if we all put that work in
Keep it twerkin 'til they close the fuckin' curtains
We all dream and we all have fantasies
Every nigga wanna buy that house for mama G
But life is like a roll of the dice, right
Sometimes you win and sometimes you just might
Lose it all, fucked up sick and don't know what to do
That's when you find out who really down to bust for you
I rock and roll from my heart and let my soul glow
And don't worry about what a nigga think he know, ya know?

Nothin' but 24/7 - 365
Eleven to eleven I be off in the fire
Of this revolution, the solution is what I'm spittin'
Fat stacks of green backs is what I'm gettin'
Jaw bones and microphones, that's what I'm hittin'
I'm hangin' on the edge of the cliff with no mittens
Thick flickin', chrome smokin', preferred potion
Man will never touch my flow, deep as the ocean
When you go down too far and you - can't seem to light
Best to look out for that pressure baby, it bust pipes
I got too much fight - in my heart, body, my insight
Is magnifyed a thousand times, more than the average guys
My status lies right before you with no disguise
The black mack is here to step up and so I rise
My shit has gone way past cold, it's freeze dry
One brain can't do what I do, you need five

How did you get the Mercedes and the Escalade lately
How come its been trouble in the places you stayed lately
The black cat affair
A broken mirror
Two steps up under the ladder would bring me near her
To good luck that fucking with you
You make the sun rain
The same moment you left
that's when the fun came

Always bumping like a bad lady ho quit that
Straight up ask a nigga to pay when he want to hit that
Always want to drank my Hennessey
And smoke weed
Take you out to see a movie

I could hit you in the car and it'll be just as fun

Bitches hatin' 'cause I'm always doing big boy stuff
Would will ill be grippin' in my big boy truck
Back then at the club gettin' this big boy sucked
Eightball, Mjg you know we can't be touched
If its 'bout Hennessy and weed you can link it to us
If I feel you disrespectin' Ima cock it and bust
And MJG gon be right with me if that eight ain't enough

If Eight ain't enough 
Don't worry I got eight in the clip
Eight for them hard looks
And eight for that lip
It was unnecessary
That sort of punishment was less than very ugly
Which was fucked up 
You wanted this you lucked up then
Oh well  some more shit I'm stuck up in 
Hey lets squash it  
Go sweep the dust up then 
Drink a shot 
I got a bitch you could drive a truck up in 
MJG pimp tight! And I got em

I fuck with them niggaz who run the hood
From the south to the east coast to the west
I be puffin on that shit that gon be burnin' in yo chest
See them hoes want a nigga who got bread
These niggaz want a bitch you got that fire head
And all I want is weed and money
And mo' money
The streets don't respect a nigga with no money

Ya poor dummy  
You should be spendin' ya ho money
When she offered you some 
You probably tell her ""no honey""
You to slow sonny
What I'm spittin' gon make you know somethin'
So the next time instead of just talking 
You could show something
And most hoes is like casinos 
Pistol blow somethin'
So anytime a bitch approach me 
I see some dope coming
My main focus is tricks who be out ho huntin'
But they don't get that pussy for free
I make em owe somethin'

[Chorus: x8]

I like them yellow thick women giving love to me
Hugs and kisses disrespecting bitches 'cause of me
Always want to sex with me no matter where we be
All her friends do my friends and they do it for free
Okay we smoke with them hoes and get em something to eat
But any real nigga will just to drill baby
Pimp hard or pimp harder for the millennium
That paper out here for ya Ima get me some

Hit a liquid some
Tell my bitch to quick get the gun
We got some shit to run so shut up and cut off the grits they done
I want you up on your feet until they blitz the song
Bitch you understand what I'm sayin'
I'm the official one
Mjg I pimp strong until the reasons gone
Until it ain't no hojack left to spring the season on 
The niggaz who violated they still bleedin' on
I be packs and shit sacks and the leavings on

Black mack, make a rookie divorce pimpin'
I didn't read about it, I was born with it and exercised
First I came with a game plan (what) next I tried it
Now what you know about that money in her snatch
When she promised you that she was givin' you the whole stack
Can't be no lover slash pimp nigga, or a player slash good boy
You either be real or Mr. Goodjoy
Cause ain't no such thing as love at first sight
But it's a such thing that you was on them drugs the first night
It's mandatory for me to appeal to the women
Keep it real with the women, but let them tricks deal with the women
And when you in the field with them women
Watch 'em, they start talkin' love shit stop 'em
Cause ain't no hoe supposed to have no emotions
Her job is to keep a trick broken and hopeless

Suck dick and lick clit on them X pills
High heels and big thighs make a dick ride
Make a nigga spend a grip and think of plenty lies
Lookin' deep in your eyes and don't mean none of it
I got the pie, you got to work if you want some of this
Where you from bitch, don't nothin' come easily
I got somethin' for you if you got somethin' for me

[Chorus - X2]
This is pimp shit, you hoes got to deal with
No nonsense, bitch, that's what this is
Pimp shit, you hoes gon' respect this
Real nigga shit and ain't scared to check a bitch

[MJG]
For four and a quarter you can get a hoe and a order
A Barbie doll bitch or a hoe from across the border
A loose bitch, a tight bitch, whatever you like
With the certain group of paint brushin' bitches consider priceless
Nut drinkers, butt spankers, dominatrix
Most ain't really with that rough shit but some can take it
One hundred percent born and bred, pimp type
Hoes make my money off of goin' to bed

[Eightball]
Givin' head, hookin' niggaz like a cigarette
Niggaz plea and pay fees, just to get a hit
Skin tight, with no hair so you can see the clit
White hoes, black hoes and hoes that Hispanic
Pierced tongue feel good when she workin' wood
Platinum Visa, PIN numbers and them check books
Turn it in, help a nigga get a new Benz
Turn out your friend, let me be both of y'all man

[Chorus - X3]
This is pimp shit, you hoes got to deal with
No nonsense, bitch, that's what this is
Pimp shit, you hoes gon' respect this
Real nigga shit and ain't scared to check a bitch",Pimp Shit,2000

So much evil in the world and it's all new
to a child who ain't been through what you been through
a kid can't play in the streets without dodging bullets
and nine times outta ten
a kid probably pulled it

Crazy rap fans, followin' my rap van
Wanna get a hug, wanna shake a playa hand
Smoke somethin', I'm a fiend for the sticky green
My whole team keep it clean like a pinky ring
Hardcore like a scene in Cabrini Green
Plenty green get a young nigga anything
Excursion, Escalade with the big rims
Denim suits, soulja rag with my gold Timbs
Poppin' pills like a nigga eatin' M&M's
Shoppin' deals at the table wit the best of them
Leave the rest of them, way in the back
Weak-ass rappers get smoked like a sack
Fat Boy did that, didn't nobody help me

I feel like I died, went to heaven and born again
Pimp tight, MJ fuckin' G
Death wish meant for anybody touchin' me
I'm a hit the dance floor with a attitude
Who's the killer now? Tell me who's the badder dude?
Who's the one who ain't afraid to let the bullets fly?
If you know you ain't gon' use it, why you pull it why?
Do you really wanna kill me and do time?
And leave ya kids and ya girlfriend left behind?

Do you really wanna hit the sauna, with some bitches and marijuana?
Sailboats offa the beaches of California
Getcha game tighter as a fist and the ice that's on it
Y'all ain't crunker than us, ghetto performers
Street roamers, still keepin the heat on us
Corner on a nice day, nigga just thought I'd warn ya
Eightball and MJG, we the buckest
Dope shit nigga, roll us up in the Duchess

One of the hardest niggas that you will ever meet
Two of the hardest niggas to bust over beats
It's all real, never fantasy or incomplete
Incomplete emcees just can't compete
Hear defeat, I'm elite when I grab a sheet
Grab a pen and compose what my life hold
Fuck what a nigga stole I'ma still roll

Eightball & MJG,"mic check one two
you know when you lose somebody 
somebody that's close to you
somebody that's probably not even that close to you
you might have just knew him
it's hard to put it into words you know
it's hard to say what you feel
it's hard to say what you feel....
I guess all wounds heal over time
you know...but uh
all i can do now is reminisce

(Verse One)
Look at my homeboy lying there dead in the street
His eyes wide open and it's fucking with me
I can't believe this shit it really seems unreal
My streetwise ass dog ended up getting killed
We used to laugh but now this shit ain't funny at all
Thinking about when my dog first started to ball
Telling me I was blessed use my gift
But it was hard to stay away from that gangsta shit (so hard)
Young eyes attract glitter like glue
Running with a crew doing everything they do
Smoked out drinking mad dog and thunderbird
My momma screaming but I swear I never heard a word
My homeboy's momma cool but she smoke crack
Now getting high is how she bring her son back
Imagine that so many kids are living this
One day my son will lose someone and reminisce
I hope it's me when I'm a hundred and three
Your homeboy getting killed that's some bad shit to see
I hope you agree and make it better for the young ones
Cause these momma's can't take no more dead sons

Chorus

Can't you see the way we live 
The world wouldn't spin without gangsta shit
I don't know what you've been told 
But baby somebody told me
(Only the strong will survive)
If I die press play to bring me back to life
(Only the strong will survive)
Hey yo if I die press play to bring me back to life

(Verse Two)
Riding around in a hoop smoked out behind tent
Serving all day hitting corners getting bent
Time went by quick when we was kicking it
I wish that there was a way I could have predicted this
Somehow thought the shit but I can't blame myself
I just wish that death would have took somebody else
That niggas' shorty looks just like he did
So in a sense I guess my homeboy will live again
In the eyes of his seed forever dad
No one to call on when momma is doing bad
Mad at the world for the pain he feels
I pray to god that his momma shows him what's real

Chorus

(Verse Three)
Every day I thank god for watching over me
If I didn't have rapping I don't know where I would be
Trying to move a key strong armed robbery
My destiny could have been an early death of me
Just to be alive pushing twenty-five
I lived to talk about the shit many didn't survive
All I ask is that we think about the lives passed away
Never to see another sunny day
>From rocks in the hand to keys in the van
No more being broke waiting on the postman
Cost more than the time that you put into it
Now you got the cheese why the fuck you still do it
Greed a need to speed away your precious time
Playa use your mind find yourself another grind
If not for yourself... for the kids sake 
Cause they'll all be where were all at today

Chorus

Man oh man
It's wild what these streets are doing to us 
You know what I'm saying?
I was thinking I was telling my homie
If I were to name all the people that I knew
That was not here with us no more
It would take a whole album 
You know what I'm saying?
So i want to say rest in peace to my homeboy pinkhouse
Rest in peace to my homeboy dice 
Who showed me much love in the short time i knew him
Rest in peace to my homeboy Nino
Much love from the hood we still ride with ya",If I Die,2001
Eightball & MJG,"All the tension in the world today
All the little girls fillin up the world today
When the good comes to bad the bad comes to good
But I'm a live my life like I should

To Shit can how we did it
Just Because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted
New era committed
Now this red cap gets a rap from his critics

Do we always gotta cry? (gotta cry)
Do we always gotta live inside a lie (a lie)

Its Movin really fast

Introduce me to some honeys that ain't actin' funny
Not them champagne, poppin those, requestin' hoes
Ain't got no dough and uhh, always want to blow dro and uhh
Always want to be showin' up, always want to say 'no' and uhh
All I really want to do is cut you up; both of us, can bust a nut
We put that thang down, I'm always gonna be myself
Never did imitate no one, never will cause I ain't got time
Not me cause I ain't that kind, cats like me hard to find
You better do like B.G. said, ""Step back and respect my mind
Eightball and MJG, since day one we was destined to be
Two MC's that put shit down, what you get is what you see
And ain't nothin gonna change dawg, we ain't gon' get strange dawg
MJG pimp these hoes, and I'm gon' be big Eightball

[Chorus]

Here we come again off that Hennessy and sticky weed
Playas of the millennium, Eightball and MJG
See some gon' hate this, just cause they can relate to this
Talk down and have a fit, cause your mom want to hear my shit
That's cool, okay, MJ, whatchu say?-aca",Put That Thing Down,2003

I came a long way from a posta posta
Till I kosta nostra kept the toaster closer

Pistol whip you hold ya throat then choke you like a croacha croacha rocha
Pull out a light and smoke you (damn)
Pull my coat off I blessed man just stressed man
Just still elementary just a glance couldn't learn it is hurting my chances
Pack pistols just to blast it (blast it)
I put it to second guessers I blast it it just to prove it (prove it)
Mother fuckers get a moving (moving)
I born into hustling I grew up tustling
Gave my muscle in and got into meeting my frail but hell I put my trust in
My left and right hand grinding threw the night
And I keep my family right and see some paper like a white man
Balling in the ninth (and) we holding in the light (and) sippin on worthless
Sprite and you can call it what you like
I call what the fuck I feel play the courts that fucking peel
But we ain't sleeping till they free and pimping here that's the fucking drill

One room one night for every day spent
Knocking a dent in the sheet-rock she's hot
Got them legs fanned open like a peacock
I saw her dancing in the club with her new outfit
Her hair and her nails did show me love
Ya man say he got good green show me some bud
Give me the real hook up price like I'm ya 'cause
Baby see I'm above the bullshit and the playing
Them hoes you listening to don't know what they saying
They relaying that he say she say language
If that's the way we trying to swing it won't swing it
M-J fucking G I ain't really new to this shit
Just want to add something new to the list

What it do baby girl
Get on the dance floor
Will you put your drink down
Come and dance with me

Money make the world go round that's what they say
Conversation rules the nation in every way
My mind thinking shit and I say it before I know
I'm at the condo busting condoms on the floor
We keep the crunk hyper than any who use a mic
We do the kinda music the pretty women gone like
A sweet smell you know with perfect nails and toes
A round cinnabun head under them clothes
I know you want to go and smoke out
Stay up all night and go eat at the Waffle House
You and me bring your friend that make three
I bet I can make you feel so sexy
Let the drank flow and burn the best dro
Put ya drank down and go hit the dance floor
Make a nigga want to get with you and spend dough
Love what you do to me mami I want to know

What it do baby girl
Get on the dance floor
Will you put your drink down
Come and dance with me

My yak spilling full of that hay I'm feeling right
Spend the night with me let's wake up and take a flight

She'll suck a nigga dick for the flight but don't bite
We gone keep it on the low no gossip and no hype

My rubber on tight on the jet on the runway
Leave Monday don't come home to Sunday

We dip Tuesday be back in town by Wednesday
Break a girl off that chain like Cunta Kintae

So will you dip with me baby girl
On a trip around the world while I play with your curls

Play with your titty nipples will that make your toes curl
You a bad motherfucker baby its your world

I know I'm coming on strong but that's me
Whatever you want I can do it correctly

So get ya mind right baby you Tina and I'm Ike
Bring that ass over here dance with Ike or we gone fight

Eightball & MJG,"And it's hard
Hard

Yea yea sittin' looking out my window the streets I see ain't pretty
Sometimes I wonder if I was born rich with plenty
Money, and everyday was sunny didn't no rain fall
Life was beautiful like the colors of a rainbow
Would I be the same prim row all my niggas know
If I didn't have to learn to beat them streets and get that dough
What if I never witnessed killings with my own two eyes
Bussin' leave they own folks layin' in the street to die
Life without respective if every second I was shakin'
Cause I injected dope in my veins
Divide and strain could I describe pain could I
Describe livin' life without desire mayne
Could I survive if I couldn't rap or entertain alive
And free you can't beat it
Who can you blame my world is like a picture and the frame
The picture might change but the frame stays the same

Hustling waiting on tomorrow
Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

What if you was on the other end of the bullet
When a killer wanna pull it would it seem like
The light flash in front of your face
Or would you run real slow like I ran in my dream like
Just the other day I tried to be a hero but it wasn't the side of me
Or maybe it just wasn't the time to be but if the shoe had to fit then I would be
Ahead of the game playin' the part I bring it all into the light from out of the dark
I hit the bat into the ball and out of the park
And live with the question alone that's meddlin' hard
What if you had to live under the bridge and do anything just to feed your kids
Think about that and the deed you did the first thing that impress me kid
Oh yes you did and I ain't even tryna choke your chain or pull your leg
And I ain't even tryna fuck with your head and I ain't even tryna sweat this shit
Just spit these messages cause I'm blessed with it
What if you had the chance to be able to switch hands with me or anyone you see
And if you really wanna take it deep this shit not quanum to me
For one and each and each and all for the sci-fi mat more religious superstitious
Politicious and all the listeners with us this shit be cold as Christmas
So put your head to the sky say a prayer for the sick and the old the young and the weak
For the bombs and the single moms with six kids askin' for something to eat

Hustling waiting on tomorrow
Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

And when you get up they seem to hold you down
Down to the ground gotta stay focused with your eyes opened wide
See the sun rise I keep my hands on the steering wheel when I'm creepin' up 75
(woo woo woo) changing lanes on the regular talkin' on my cellular fast
Watching cause they wanna take me away
I'm just trying to feed my babies face
But I'm just hustling I'm waiting on tomorrow

Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

One hundred and thirty dead from squeezin' off one time

Let it rip, don't slip, I'm workin' with fly clips

Crush your bones when its on, we ain't never scared
Them Memphis boys, we so serious when its bout that bread
Kidnap family members, them niggaz don't leave no witness
They all love a gangsta, that shit be so addictive
When we pull up, they know who we are by the car
We blowin' big, and you know Diddy he gonna buy the bar

Take your vest off, I'm blowin' your neck off and eyes out
High speed chase, I'll follow you to your hideout
Shoot your fuckin' tires out, don't try to ride now
What happened to the bass in your voice, you just cryin' now
Thought you was a man, you starting to look fine now
The grim reaper been lookin' for ya, and boy its time now
And blow the roll, shit out the right side of your head man
ain't no way for retaliation when yous'a dead man

We stayin' away from lames, and run the whole game

See a nigga like me gonna get money till I get rich
Ride with a couple hundred G's in a biscuit
Stay down for whatever forever hustle with my mystic hoes
And soon you gonna see just how crunk this shit be once we get rich
Till then it's back to hustlin' with my misfits
Deep, on a creep, fifty songs tucked under the prone
Fifty songs tucked under the prone

I keep a big old nigga beater heater
It's in the trunk of my four-door and my two seater
I'm make them say skeeter skeeter
Keep up and grab the ball back just like I'm Derek Jeter
I know you want to fuck my hoe but you too scared to meet her
See you ain't got enough bread to even start to treat her
The way a pimp did, and in the bed I'm even sweeter
I hustle, I got more Franklins in me than Aretha
If I had Oprah Winfrey I would marry her and keep her
I spit as much knowledge as preachers and teachers
Just as long as the message reach us we all fill up the bleachers
I'm the MJG, I get in yo' shit
I ain't trying to run yo' clique, that be your friend so quick

Straight flying when I hustle, that's how I represent

Smoking up, drinking up, kicking dust, and fucking up
Everybody want a piece and we ain't got enough for us
Yeah, I touched a brick or two, pounds I done smoked a few
Got my bread and didn't do what the fuck I was supposed to do
Money blinds players, turns them into evil spirits
Niggaz die trying to live out these old rap lyrics
I try to give it to them just how it come to me
Real and unedited, not like it be on T.V
Be myself and don't be what those haters want me to be
Take the good the bad hit my knees set me free
Make the bad good, put that on my leather and wood
Cinderella with my fellas deep off in the hood

Turn around the broom handle and trying to hold it
It's plenty dirt to be swept, and leaves to be raked

Eightball & MJG,"[Verse 1: Eightball]
What kind of nigga always run his mouth like a hoe
Like his jaw got a battery, this nigga always know
Who got robbed, got shot, who got put on lock
Nobody invited you and still you got up in the spot
Me, I'm not a witness, keep my distance, mind my business
You, somebody talk, you in they mouth like a dentist
We keep it gangsta, mommas love it cause they know it's real
Like UGK, ""we keeps it real"" mobbin' through the field
Big Ball, Fatboy, unload heat when my brain spill
You for it, images without no coke connect pills
We keep it crunk and poppin' real niggaz know the deal
We Bad Boys, anywhere we at we smoke and kill
You try to stop it, get yo' shit broke up in twenty pieces
We roll deep in brand new vehicles wit secret features
Game preachers move yo' pimpin' for you mamasitas
We players on the field, why'all niggas in them bleachers

[Chorus: 8 ball: x2]
You talkin' down behind my back (uh) you done shot off nigga
Fifty, four or twenty sack, you done shot off nigga
If you fly and got a gun (uh) when the drama come, you run 
You know what you just done, you done shot off nigga

[Verse 2: MJG]
Man, come on now, you done shot off just like Mike Davis lost a knockoff
Or his tight-ass shirt when the button pop off
You standin' it's snowin' you got yo' shoes and socks on
Who holds the key? No fucking bout it, I broke the lock off
I grew the top off, took the comma, period, dot off
And ran on wit it and broke you a whole lot off
I'm gettin' hot and startin' to boil, don't turn the pot off
You just affected wit it, pimpin' yo, get yo' rocks off
Release some pressure, stop all that cryin' and wipe ya snot off
Excuses you be usin' for losin' it's cheap as hot sauce
Earn yo' position, stop hatin' because you not boss
M-J-G, pimp tight, I'm movin' yo' spot off
And I don't reach, stoppin' yo' plans, fucking yo' plot off
I go hard and I don't sheave and I'm not off
And livin' on the edge rebellin' I'm never dropped off
Like Aaron Hall, ""Don't Be Afraid"" bitch, call the cops off

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Now you can either check yo' ego at the do' (door) or let the drama unfold
And check my Rap Sheet, bitch, I'm almost ten million sold
I'm only rappin' cause I want to, I got enough plaques
Needless to say, my favorite rappers told me to get on this track
And so I DID it, quickly wrote my sixteen down and SPIT it
By the end of the verse you'll say, ""once again, Ludacris shit it""
Then I'll wipe this wit yo' face and put yo' pride in the trash
My whole career is like my video, I'm showin' my ass
I keeps it, ""gangsta, gangsta!"" shooters and shanksters
Until you shot off motherfuckers, I'm a ""thank ya, thank ya!""
Runnin' yo' mouth behind my back until you run out of time
But at least yo' talkin' let's me know some millions stay on yo' mind
It ain't nothin' wrong wit that
Tell em grabbin' the thing and then I put it to yo' brain
And change everything you ever hope for (for) wit the .44
You'll be fallin' back
And Yacht, is what I'm drinkin' steady thinkin' bout these pinks chasin'
I'm bout to bring home the bacon

Not too much 'cause where I from niggas ain't motherfuckin' talkin'
We'd rather listen and watch
Tryin' to flex and guard their clothes and Baume and Mercier watches
Tryin' to get my gloss on
I paid the 'cause' to be the boss on these corners where ballin' niggas floss on
Haters get tossed on, 5-0 get ? and out of towners get robbed
and drop that, can't nobody gonna stop that
See it was like this before me
So if you think it's time to change, nigga show me
Obviously you don't know me It's time that you learned

They found his headless body tied up in a dark alley
It's cold like ice and snow on a nigga soul
For bricks or snow, niggaz will fuck you like a dirty hoe
Kick yo' door and put and your babies on the floor

Fuck these hoes and stack my cheese

Stop at the light and pause on 3
Hit the mall and it be all on me
But gotta keep one eye out for the po-po
Close the window when I roll the indo
Know they mad 'cause I roll the Benzo
It's that purple not pretend-o
Three 6 Mafia and they my kin folks
So when I'm in Memphis, Ten-a-key

Yo girlfriend wanna ride with me
In the car wit a pimp where she supposed ta be
You ain't met no dudes spittin' cold as me
With a bag of kush that cost six-fifty
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughin' and choking constantly
Tastes like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That should be the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit,
Hit that shit, hold that shit,
Blow that shit out slow
Then pass it to me bro

MJ gonna sprinkle in some of that
Super incredible, leave a nigga runnin' back
Where the nigga really good sticky number at
Cuttin' through the cigarillo like a lumberjack
In the morning what I need is to breath again a whole lot of weed
But maybe somebody can give me what I need when I want no less than the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J, 8-ball and M-J-G
And Young Buck we don't give a fuck

Do I ever cross your mind anytime

Still have your picture in a frame
Hear your footsteps down the hall
I swear I hear your voice, driving me insane
How I wish that you would call

Do I ever cross your mind, anytime
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me
Do I ever cross your mind anytime
I miss you

Nobody been this long awaited since Jesus
Who wouldn't believe this, I heard the word on the street is
I'm still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas
They said I changed the times from the rhymes that I thought of
So I made some more to put the New World in Order
with Mathematics, put your status above the average
And help you rappers, make paragraphs with graphics
Cause new days is dawning, new ways of performing
Brainstorming, I write and watch the night turn to morning
On and on and, I got the whole world responding
Rock, I keep it hot and blow the spot without warning

full of adventure, turning up the temperature

like I told ya, greater stronger, now that I'm older
I broke the, code of silence with overloads of talents
My only challenge, is not to explode in violence
I'm Asiatic, and blazing microphones a habit
At least once during the course of a day, it's automatic
In ghetto apparel, mind of a Egyptian Pharoah
Far from shallow, thoughts travel like an arrow
Allah's monotony, so far they can't stop me
You know, Ra want property like Mumar Khadafi
More thoughts than Bibles, recital, taught disciples
A sawed off mic, so words scatter like a rifle
Thoughts that's trifle, I'm busting these for you

Critics and biters, don't know where my source of light is
Still leave authors and writers with arthritis
Cursed kids like the Pyramids when they found the style
First to ever let a rhyme flow down the Nile
The rebirth of hip-hop'll be dropped now
cause the crowd didn't hear the original in a while
So be alarmed, what you bout to see is the bomb
Like, 3-D in 'Nam, vivid like CD-Rom
Info kept like ""internet.com""

To get me some hay from my nigga in the Tray
And a four of that drank to go with my dank
It makes me lean all day
About three, I'm full of them trees
A dog want to hunt for a pack of fleas
Can I get me a freezy please
These H-Town freaks be a hundred degrees
It felt like a dream, sittin' on the lot at Dairy Queen
Very clean, in my dirty three pullin' machine
Jeans with tightly packed booty caught my eyes
My mind started to wonder about the prize between her thighs
She caught me lookin' grinnin'
Sharing my thoughts of late night sinnin'
Hey baby can I speak to you (Naw, naw you probably got plenty women)
Damn, how you gonna shoot a playa down
Before the conversation gets started baby
Ain't you done seen me and MJG on BET with J-O-E
Anyway, I wonder if we could set this thing off properly
Jet to one of my properties and blow a bag of that broccoli
Possibly, we could be, more than friends if you let it be

I was chillin' at the bar, girl gave me the eye
So I had to start a conversation took by vision of my bone
Made me feel this chick was on
She said (I'm bored I ain't did nothin but lay round the house all week)
And so I said in my mind
That's a line of a flat down straight up ho down freak
Then I pulled her to the side and I asked her what's up
She said (What's on ya mind)
I said well if ya thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
We straight ya ain't gonna waste my time
Then I shuffled to the bar
Done missed the stuff that was goin' at the affair
Then as I came to the corner of the wall
I noticed that the girl was just standin' there
And then she gave me a look
Not an ordinary look but a look that made me thank
Did she want to romance, did she want to hit and run
Man, she out to try to count my bank
Now I was sippin' on the Hen and she approached me again
Choosin' on the playa with a grin, telling her friend
(Girl, I'ma be a lil' late gettin' in)
Now I was feelin' kind of hot in the spot
Gotta figure out a way to get my temperature down
Hit the town, ran a red to the hip without a flip
Without all these windows is around
Let's me and you do what we gotta do to get through

It's just something bout the moon and the stars
And the dark blue sky that turns me on
I be chillin' in the day by the time somthing down
Gotta get better believe I'm gone
Now you can call me the vampire type
Batman livin' in a cave no lights
Seem too bright MJ outta sight
Never gotta fuss plus I never gotta fight
I might make another round through the Mound
Gotta get a sack of hay to make my trip complete
Look at all the women still hangin' in the streets
Temptation is an animal hard for me to beat
But as I creep through the midnight
Checkin' out the few tail I'd like to get right quick
Got my hand on my tone if a crook try to get me
Then a crook gonna wind up sick
I need to find a way to spend my time
Situation dirty, gotta erase my mind
Hangin' out to dry like clothes on a line
Everything fine, just like wine
Ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves in the trees
Young women knees in a fresh set of keys
Now I'm fixin' to break em' to the birds and the bees
MJ put the P in tha ABC
In the morning I'ma stay up in the bed
Reaching for the cup filled up with ice
Blend it in with that H2O coolin' me off from my flight

Make me circle through the neighborhood 55 times
With my gas tank full, drank a boor
Fall up in the park after dark try to pull
Me a young, stout woman, sumpin' pretty
Nice round hills, with them wear shaped titties
As the sun goes down, I'm gettin' dirty
Fall up and press a word get cleaned in a hurry
In my 77 Chevy, ass tight
Pull off cuttin' rubber, disappearin' in the night

Just like candy (candy)
Just like candy
Its the same feeling (looks good to me)

10 o'clock in the morning, his A got up
Chief and Haywood some Kool-Aid in my favorite cup
Comb my hair, get my grill right so I can feel tight
Havin' starch in my jeans and a fresh pair of Nike's
As I strike, out the door, to my superb
Parked by the curb, candy coated bird
The sun got my candy lookin' good enough to eat
You can tell by the way the girls act across the street
Hit the horn, but no stallin', keep ballin'
4 o'clock Sunday, I gotta hit the mall and
Fall in full of them green trees
Hurry up so I can catch Martin Luther King
Fools all in the way with that econo-spray
Need to take a few classes, learn about Manassas
Pressure got me beamed, I'm talkin' on the phone
Tellin' Penny that's the way to do it, baby represent ya home

Just like candy (candy)
Just like candy (It takes over me)
Its the same feeling (looks good to me)

Mechanical to pain will bring flavors to your mind
And in the summertime we got the whole block blind
Some busta in a primed out Pinto poppin game
Lying sayin' he goin' get the same thang
If you ain't ridin' wood, and leather, your ride ain't hittin'
A plane dash for a crush, forever got you itchin'
99.95, 30 day paint jobs
Got niggas ridin' round lookin' like a junk yard
You need to pull a check, wheeler check, wheeler check
Stack up on your grip, get your shit sprayed wet
See most of these new paint jobs they don't do
But if it ain't candy then the job ain't true

Its reserved for them ballaz, who make that cheese
It ain't candy if it didn't cost a couple of G's
On your Jeep, your truck, your Chevy or your Lexus
5th wheel on the grill like them playaz do in Texas
My folks gettin' sideways in Vallejo
Ballaz in Memphis slammin' shut the Cadillac doors
Full of ink so blinked I could fly
To a world where you have to roll candy or you die
Descending, my mind goes back into reality
To some, having candy paint is just a fantasy
Custom leather everywhere you look is wood grain
Big Ball tellin' you its all about the candy mane

Eightball & MJG,"Roach spraid on the block
Then I took my throwback
Now my soldiers posted up
Hangin' like a coat rack
Gun in the bushes and
Work in the stash spot
Overtime, al night
Try'na make a fat knock
Swell in my pocket
Like I'm carryin' a loaf of bread
Been around the world
But I still love local head
Got the shit to make 'em jump
It's hyper like a pimp rally
Give 'em just a piece it make 'em
Mime me like a skip daddy
Glock, Chevy parked in the yard
Wit' the double pipes
If I catch ya try'na steal it
I'ma get double life
I ain't wanna do it, I ain't even really hate son
That's a damn shame but tomorrow, I'ma make ???
Black Hummer waitin' for me in front of the jail house
Comin' for the boys who thought that I wouldn't bail out
Top notch citizen, on top of his shit again
Pimp type, M-J-G, another hit again

This some grown man shit, pussy ass nigga!
How you wanna do it, we can just get to it
(Watchu wanna do, how you wanna do it?)
(Pussy ass nigga, we can just get to it, bitch)
This some grown man shit, pussy ass nigga!
How you wanna do it, we can just get to it

Boys ask me all the time
Am I tired of the grind
Hell naw nigga, gettin' richer
That's all on my mind
Twist the pine, smoke a pound
Grabbin' chickens, buy a ticket
Delta airlines, pimp, I got some down ass bitches
Broads wit' them credit cards
Make her listen, let her charge
Flat TVs and some tiles for my momma car
Eighty-thousand dollars, I'mma fuckin' ghetto superstar
Work come soft, never hard, that's a different charge
Tre-8 never jam if I gotta blam blam!
If you not a regular, I'm taxin' you like Uncle Sam
Rubber gloves, blue magic and some Downy sheets
Plenty plastic wrap and a vacuum pack machine
My uncle, ""Old School"" don't need nothin' but a triple-beam
A dollar and a plate, he like to hit it while he mix it
I be rollin' up blunts in the den, countin' bread
Thirty dollars till my heart stop beatin' and I'm dead

Unh
Sweet Jones is the pimp of the year
Wrist full of frozen fireworks
Six in my ear, fly hoes and chains and
Swangin' on them thangs bitch
No I ain't no lame, got cocaine
It ain't no thang bitch, for you to drive down holl'n for ten
Guaranteed when ya test it you'll come and get 'em again
I heard a nigga say his name was Pimp see on that ""Boss'n Up"" movie
But that nigga ain't me
Too many clones in the streets and on the microphone
Pussy ass niggaz need to leave my legacy alone
Cause I'm a motherfuckin' king in that Texas
Don't hesitate to put that thang on them plexers
Cause it ain't no thang to lay yo' lump off in yo' lap boy
Hit his figure wit' the trigger, scratch off in the toy
Fuck me, not a change nigga fuck you
You want a war? It's whateva you bitches wanna do

Every time I do it I do it for my hood
Every time I do it I do it for my hood 
And every time I do it I do it for they hood
And every time I do it I do it for yo hood
And every time I do it I do it for they hood
It's understood I do it for the hood

The streets love jeezy and I love 'em back
If I still had the work I getcha sack
It's all gravy still reaching wit my words
And make 'em feel good on the first and the third
Take you back when I was sixteen wits a bankroll
Posted on a corner like a light pole
They used to call us track stars
Before they even stopped we ran to dem cars
And everybody on the block got the same agenda
Hustle from the beginning of January til the end of December
Wasn't smokin purple then it was more like bobby brown
On that hen dog got a nigga drinking straight brown (7/11 nigga you know)
You know 10 to 4 shake 'em up talk shit get my drink and let 'em go
Even when I'm on the road the gangstas stay in touch
Why you think they love me so much (ha ha!)

[Chorus]

I'm talking bout summertime cookouts and wintertime flights
It ain't nothing we hearing shots all night
Ford Taurus pulls up everybody run
White boys jump out running wit they guns (5-0, 5-0)
Ford Taurus leave everybody came back
Hope dem boys didn't find my sack
Real recognize real I suppose
I guess that's why the gangstas be at all my shows
Got the deal nothing changed but my clothes
Still catch me in the jects fuckin' wit' dem hoes (projects!)
Like coo-coo cal
Lord I wish mad Lou could see me now
Wish gold mouth was there wish mailman was free
A lot of niggas crossing over dog no not me
Plus I been in the commercials when I watch TV
And everybody know I rep these streets faithfully

Just like candy 
Its the same feeling (looks good to me) 

I'm creepin' low in a flip flop drop 
Top Stang leanin' to the left gold dadens on them thang 
I'm the MJG pimp tight 
Put it to the floor 5 0 swang a right 
In a pina butta guts is a must 
Drivin' in the shop take a mile grab em up 
Paint a ten clear coats to make it shine 
Make me circle through the neighborhood 55 times 
With my gas tank full, drank a boor 
Fall up in the park after dark try to pull 
Me a young, stout woman, sumpin' pretty 
Nice round hills, with them wear shaped titties 
As the sun goes down, I'm gettin' dirty 
Fall up and press a word get cleaned in a hurry 
In my 77 Chevy, ass tight 
Pull off cuttin' rubber, disappearin' in the night 

Just like candy (candy) 
Just like candy 
Its the same feeling (looks good to me) 

10 o'clock in the morning, his A got up 
Chief and Haywood some cool-Aid in my favorite cup 
Comb my hair, get my grill right so I can feel tight 
Havin' starch in my jeans and a fresh pair of Nikes 
As I strike, out the door, to my superb 
Parked by the curb, candy coated bird 
The sun got my candy lookin' good enough to eat 
You can tell by the way the girls act across the street 
Hit the horn, but no stallin', keep ballin' 
4 o'clock Sunday, I gotta hit the mall and 
Fall in full of them green trees 
Hurry up so I can catch Martin Luther King 
Fools all in the way with that econo-spray 
Need to take a few classes, learn about Manassas 
Pressure got me beamed, I'm talkin' on the phone 
Tellin' Penny that's the way to do it, baby represent ya home 

Just like candy (candy) 
Just like candy (It takes over me) 
Its the same feeling (looks good to me) 

Mechanical to pain will bring flavors to your mind 
And in the summertime we got the whole block blind 
Some busta in a primed out Pinto poppin' game 
Lying sayin' he goin' get the same thang 
If you ain't ridin' wood, and leather, your ride ain't hittin' 
A plane dash for a crush, forever got you itchin' 
99.95, 30 day paint jobs 
Got niggaz ridin' round lookin' like a junk yard 
You need to pull a check, wheeler check, wheeler check 
Stack up on your grip, get your shit sprayed wet 
See most of these new paint jobs they don't do 
But if it ain't candy then the job ain't true 
 
Its reserved for them ballaz, who make that cheese 
It ain't candy if it didn't cost a couple of G's 
On your Jeep, your truck, your Chevy or your Lexus 
5th wheel on the grill like them playaz do in Texas 
My folks gettin' sideways in Vallejo 
Ballaz in Memphis slammin' shut the Cadillac doors 
Full of ink so blinked I could fly 
To a world where you have to roll candy or you die 
Descending, my mind goes back into reality 
To some, having candy paint is just a fantasy 
Custom leather everywhere you look is woodgrain'

And we don't hustle cause we wanna, cause we have to
God 1st, fam next, and all the rest after

Everything I say is the truth (is the truth!)

Create somethin', ya life give ya nothin'

Cash rule everything, keep that on ya brain

I gotta order motherfuckin' rappers, teachers, preachers, and athletes
All make a personal visit or to the back-streets
I even gotta hoe, play away
With one rule, till ya gray, nigga stay away
See I'm the reason why ya let'cha girl stay at the house
And beat her up 'cause my name couldn't stay out her mouth
And I don't need to know if she just wanna join the team
Get down and kiss all up on my ring
I keep a Cadillac and I select a few in my car
If you don't own one, then you ain't got shit in ya garage
I go hard, you motherfuckas ain't breakin' a hoe
You just flyin' bitches in, showcasing a hoe

Eightball & MJG,"It was some what early, I was on my way
To get me some hay from my nigga in the Tray
And a four of that drank to go with my dank
It makes me lean all day
About three, I'm full of them trees
A dog wanna hunt for a pack of fleas
Can I get me a freezy please?
These H-Town trees be a hundred degrees
It felt like a dream, sittin' on the lot at Dairy Queen
Very clean, in my dirty three pullin' machine
Jeans with tightly packed booty caught my eyes
My mind started to wonder about the prize between her thighs
She caught me lookin' grinnin'
Sharing my thoughts of late night sinnin'
Hey baby can I speak to you (Naw, naw you probably got plenty women)
Damn, how you gonna shoot a playa down
Before the conversation gets started baby
Ain't you done seen me and MJG on BET with J-O-E
Anyway, I wonder if we could set this thing off properly
Jet to one of my properties and blow a bag of that broccoli
Possibly, we could be, more than friends if you let it be
Imagine it, you and me, in the middle of the night

In the middle of the night, you can do it so right
You could feel real good, lay your head back
Inside my ride, put your hand on the wood, good
And tell me lil' something that I really wanna hear, baby have no fear
I'll be oblige to the side of the mack of the year so bring it over here
In the middle of the night, you can do it so right

In the middle of the night

I was chillin' at the bar, girl gave me the eye
So I had to start a conversation took by vision of my bone
Made me feel this chick was on
She said (I'm bored I ain't did nothin but lay round the house all week)
And so I said in my mind
That's a line of a flat down straight up ho down freak
Then I pulled her to the side and I asked her what's up
She said (What's on ya mind)
I said well if ya thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
We straight ya ain't gonna waste my time
Then I shuffled to the bar
Done missed the stuff that was goin' at the affair
Then as I came to the corner of the wall
I noticed that the girl was just standin' there
And then she gave me a look
Not an ordinary look but a look that made me thank
Did she wanna romance, did she wanna hit and run
Man, she out to try to count my bank
Now I was sippin' on the Hen and she approached me again
Choosin' on the playa with a grin, telling her friend
(Girl, I'mma be a lil' late gettin' in)
Now I was feelin' kind of hot in the spot
Gotta figure out a way to get my temperature down
Hit the town, ran a red to the hip without a flip
Without all these witnesses around
Let's me and you do what we gotta do to get through
The rest of this episode, hold on tight
Let's re-write in the middle of the night

That's the way I gotta flip when I be
Feelin' 'ike I wanna take a dip in the wind
Night-life livin' all the way to the end
It's just something bout the moon and the stars
And the dark blue sky that turns me on
I be chillin' in the day by the time somthing down
Gotta get better believe I'm gone
Now you can call me the vampire type
Batman livin' in a cave no lights
Seem too bright MJ outta sight
Never gotta fuss plus I never gotta fight
I might make another round through the Mound
Gotta get a sack of hay to make my trip complete
Look at all the women still hangin' in the streets
Temptation is an animal hard for me to beat
But as I creep through the midnight
Checkin' out the few tail I'd like to get right quick
Got my hand on my tone if a crook try to get me
Then a crook gonna wind up sick
I need to find a way to spend my time
Situation dirty, gotta erase my mind
Hangin' out to dry like clothes on a line
Everything fine, just like wine
Ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves in the trees
Young women knees and a fresh set of keys
Now I'm fixin' to break em' to the birds and the bees
MJ put the P in tha ABC
In the morning I'mma stay up in the bed
Reaching for the cup filled up with ice
Blend it in with that H2O coolin' me off from my flight

In the middle of the night, you can do it so right

Graduated and made it from the college of dicks 
Now who the fuck you be, bitch you know me 
Tryin' to act solo, down low, hush-hush, and lo-key 
 
Nah hoe I ain't po', where did my motherfuckers go 
I remember this hoe, she used to do nails for Rochelle's, well 
How the hell you been since I had no job 
Hum, why don't you give me some 
 
'Cause you know I flow and run for Suave 
Nah, all of that was on the couch 
No doubt why y'all records spin, why y'all shippin' in gold 
It's cold On The Outside lookin' in (brrrr!) 
 
You'd best a make yourself worthy 
Cause I got a click of niggas ready to get their johnson very dirty 
You heard me push these thirty dicks, inside your pearly clit 
Ain't this a bitch 

I remember when you would not give me shit 
Now you down for them habits 
Put your numbers on them naturals 
Make it snappy cause I got to go to the bathroom

Hoes with no clothes sure enough
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what? 
Hoes with no clothes sure enough 
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?

She's just an ordinary hoe 
Hair extensions, long nails, ass thicker than gumbo 
Make it fast, takin' cash, shakin' ass in the mix 
 
Tens turn to twenties and twenties come from plenty tricks 
Niggas in love 
Can't stay out the club 
All in the hoe's face 
But at the end of the paper chase, whatever you had will be erased 
 
I see him in the back 
Countin' up that cheddar 
Talkin' loud, smokin' hay, makin' clouds, gettin' ready for the crowd 
I think I know one 
 
I remember you, oh yes I do 
Tryin' to hide side from me and my crew, but ain't no love lost boo 
What time the club close, at 3 
What's up, you comin' with me 

We can smoke up mad trees after you get up off your knees 
You want some cheese 
Hoes don't stay at the suave house 
Hoes around my nuts like knots 
 
Real dogs don't pay for cats, that's 
For real baby 
Recognize and sho me love, dig that shit, sure enough

Wants to get close to me

Lookin' for, confidants, and tickets to my next show 
Check yo' bitch 
In these short ass pants and blow up dresses 
I can tell they freaky with out three guesses 
 
Oh yes it's very true 
Your bitches be needin' me, leavin' you 
Hell, now what the fuck is a nigga like me supposed to do 
Let her loose or let her remain 

'Cause all she be lookin' for is some fame 
A bigger name 
Look, this thang with bigger game 
And she claim she ain't heard my music 
 
Tryin' to trick me 
So I told that hoe my name Bill Bigsley 
She still hit me 
Now she, killin' my dick softly with her mouth and I 
 
Really just don't plan on takin' it out cause I

Eighty4 Fly,"Everything is gold, everything is equal
Posted on the porch just chillin', me and my people
Eyelids closed, gold sun shines on
The world’s coated in the gold Krylon
Yea, and these days days days
They never run away
Gold tints, shades, that block out that golden haze
Take all the gold from the pawnshop that lives behind the case
And get to give it away
My gold erupted from volcano's in the heavens
And every shrine that existed in time melting
Tombs open, Dookie Ropes on the bells
When everything is gold, who cares about the carats?
They say that gold's the skin of the gods
You can’t take the band there when you’re gone
Now I’ll tip over that kiosk in the mall
As the sunset falls into tomorrow

Today we’re feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, row fun, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toe
Ghost slowly faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

Five hundred thousand soul
Slick rick gold, row fun, hella cold
Yea we’re feeling like gold
So fresh head to toe
Ghost slowly faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

Alright now we open up that car door
Hop out, hope they notice us
Throughout society we been locked in that cobra clutch
More gold bottles, gold bottles, never sober up
Ditch Jesus, In gold I Trust
I solemnly swear to wear my cross and stunt
Separate myself by sticking out just because
That’s how you illustrate power and who you’re above
But nah, tonight we take it, take it, giving it back
Crack open the vault, let everyone mob in the bank
Take whatever they want, we party and give thanks
I've been rocking gold chains since pee was in the tank
You only live once, you only live once
Watch Rick Ross give his Jesus piece to a bum
'Cause tonight we ball, we ball, we comin’ up
Paintin' the globe gold, two steppin’ on the sun

Like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, row fun, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toe
Ghost slowly faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

Oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Today we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Gold coins, gold phone, gold car
Costs at least 10 racks to get 16 gold bars
Gold rush, suck on my gold dust stuntin'
Under these gold trunks, that’s 2 golden nugget
Flyin' on the gold eagle, flier than the rest of ‘em
Passing space needle, golden shower on pedestrians
Excuse me, that’s my bad, that’s my eagle and he shouldn’t of
My eagle got hair, that motherfucker got a mullet bruh
And it’s gold, two girls gold brass
Lounging on the water, feet in the gold sand
Sipping on Orangina, arms around them both pants
They’re sipping Olde English right out of a gold can
Two girls, gold spandex so pretty
That girl ain’t even gold, she just got golden girl titties
I’m kidding, everyone is gold in my city
You paint Betty White gold, even Betty White can get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it

Today we’re feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, row fun, hella cold

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1995

Twenty fo' inches on the whip, got these *** sick
Flickin' out the parkin' lot, haters like to bark a lot
At the hoodie club, that'll make them *** spark a lot

Akademik jeans starched up wit' the Jordans on
Spot a *** ***, get her number and I'm rollin' on
Maybe baby mama mayne, I don't want no drama mayne
She's a ghetto rat, they attract to my diamond rangs

Ain't no thang, when it comes to ballin' nothin' new to me
Fronts in my mouth, part of jewelry and toolery
Cool to be, a hood rich *** from this Memphis
Ridin' in this Cut-Dog, dog, feelin' pimpish, ya dig?

Mayne I stayed in them stores, stayed chasin' ***
Stayed ridin' clean, sippin' ***, *** was in my drawers
Stayed in the club, kept a mean mug, had to keep a ***
In my mind I'm the one, so I'm shinin' like the sun

Kept the cottonmouth, reppin' dirty south, stayed housin' broads
A blunt was in my mouth, always schemin' tryna break some laws
Stayed gettin' caught, by them cops, still was on the block
Tryna set up shop, still was slangin' rocks

Always kept a knot, stayed doin' time, still was on the grind
Had to pop that nine, *** gots to shine, had to make 'em bleed
Had to make 'em see, takin' somethin' from the kid
You'll be history, that's for any wannabe

Out of town were the people I knew

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down

Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know,1991

When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

Eileen Farrell,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me,

I'm limp as a glove,

Eileen Farrell,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,1994

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Beyond the years, 
'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,

My love and I
So close, we can share a single look

My eyes grow misty too

Our dreams won't come tumbling to the ground
We'll hold them fast

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2005

With a bottle full of rain
I promised to the coaster
I wouldn't tear it up again

Flick a peanut, break a glass
I wish I didn't sleep at Mass
And everything is closin' up
And yet again I come in last

I saw it in a dream
It was another time
And everything was blue
Everything was fine

And you were always there
And I could see clear
I was always yours
You were always mine

Rise above it, rise above it, rise above it

I see her on the ceiling
She's staring down in her gown
I had to make allowances
Between my love and goin' out

Now everything is closing up
The last call is well asleep
At gigs I danced with a Blue Nun
Now heartburn is goin' cheap

I saw it in a dream
It was another time
Everything was true
Everything sublime

And you were always there
And I could see clear
I was always yours
You were always mine

Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot; I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot

Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?

Some get a kick from cocaine
I’m sure that if, I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it’s clear to me
You obviously do not adore me

Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick out of you

A bee begins a buzzin'
Makin' honey out of dew

And roses by the dozen
Bloom where flowers never grew
Warmed by the sun from above
Another miracle of love

Yes, I believe in miracles
That miracles come true
Dear, I believe in miracles
Just look at me and you

Two strangers in the morning
Then two friends this afternoon
Now strangers in the morning
Are two sweethearts 'neath the moon

Close as a hand in a glove
Another miracle of love",Miracle of Love,1995
Eileen Rodgers,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top! 
You're the Coliseum. 
You're the top! 
You're the Louver Museum. 
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss 
You're a Bendel bonnet, 
A Shakespeare's sonnet, 
You're Mickey Mouse. 
You're the Nile, 
You're the Tower of Pisa, 
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine. 
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 
Might think that your song is bad, 
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion 
And this is what I'm going to add; 

You're the top! 
You're Mahatma Gandhi. 
You're the top! 
You're Napoleon Brandy. 
You're the purple light 
Of a summer night in Spain, 
You're the National Gallery 
You're Garbo's salary, 
You're cellophane. 
You're sublime, 
You're turkey dinner, 
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner 
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're an arrow collar 
You're the top! 
You're a Coolidge dollar, 
You're the nimble tread 
Of the feet of Fred Astaire, 
You're an O'Neill drama, 

You're Whistler's mama! 

You're camembert. 

You're a rose, 
You're Inferno's Dante, 

You're the nose 
On the great Durante. 
I'm just in a way, 
As the French would say, ""de trop"". 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a dance in Bali. 
You're the top! 
You're a hot tamale. 
You're an angel, you, 
Simply too, too, too diveen, 
You're a Boticcelli, 
You're Keats, 
You're Shelly! 

You're Ovaltine! 
You're a boom, 
You're the dam at Boulder, 
You're the moon, 
Over Mae West's shoulder, 
I'm the nominee of the G.O.P. 

Or GOP! 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a Waldorf salad. 
You're the top! 
You're a Berlin ballad. 
You're the boats that glide 
On the sleepy Zuider Zee, 
You're an old Dutch master, 

You're Lady Astor, 
You're broccoli! 
You're romance, 
You're the steppes of Russia, 
You're the pants, on a Roxy usher, 
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop,

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep

I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free

Eileen Rose,"Angel falls in the water, wets his wings
He can't fly for a while, it's one of those things

So there's salt in the water, a bitter taste
Just one chance in a lifetime
But you're wasted, you waste it
You spend so much time thinking like they do

When there's so much out there you can't imagine, it's
Such a drag, but it's so much better than me
Trays up, wheels up, coming in
Come and sing now

Something caught in the engine, so down I go
With sunlight on the head of my hero
Well, it's forward, or fall

But there's so much out there you can't imagine, it's
Such a drag, but it's so much better than me
Same problems, the same old pain
I got Tom Waits crooning and he's so much better than me
Trays up, wheels up coming in
Come and sing Tom, yeah, and come again
In your hip black jeans, and your portable phone
You wanna tell me about America, well

Like ""I love you, dear"" and ""You're for me""

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Where earthquakes live with car alarms
Mature mild-mannered catastrophes

And take them off, take them off again
Like excessive jewelry

You me knows what Me you wants
Me you knows what You me wants
And it's granted

They defend each other against the past
If the future isn't bright at least it's colorful
So burn the ship come spring

They fail, fail and try again
Fall off a cliff, succeed, and fall, fall again

They have proven quite effectively
That bumblebees indeed can fly
Against the field's authority

They invent each other ever anew
Still they won't have a different view
Of everyone or anything

Defend themselves against the whims of fate
Question the statistics, accelerate
The status quo, deny the rules of gravity

But they don't use the word
Once dropped it might break

They do not say that they have loved
For who can say
We were killed yesterday

Seeing our dragons when we look up)

My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me
Inn her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days
There wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all

And as she walked away and I looked at my wife
And then and there I thankedd the good Lord
For the gifts in my life

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs

I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner
And then I found out,
""Single"" he told me
Single, my ass 
Not only was he married
Oh, no, he had six wives
One of those Mormons, you know 
So that night when he came home from work, 
I fixed him his drink as usual
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic

He had it coming
He had it coming
He took a flower
In its prime
And then he used it
And he abused it
It was a murder
But not a crime!

Now, I'm standing in the kitchen
Carvin' up a chicken for dinner,
Minding my own business,
In storms my husband Wilbur in a jealous rage.
""You been screwin' the milkman,"" he says. 
He was crazy
And he kept on screamin',
""You been screwin' the milkman.""
And then he ran into my knife.
He ran into my knife ten times!

If you'd have been there
If you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same!

Mit kersek, en itt? 
Azt mondjok, hogy a hires lakem lefogta a ferjemet 
En meg Lecsaptam a fejet. De nem igaz,
En artatlan vagyok. 
Nem tudom 
Mert mondja Uncle Sam hogy en tettem. 
Probaltam
A rendorsegen megmayarazni de nem ertettek meg

Yeah, but did you do it?

Uh uh, not guilty!

(He had it coming)
My sister, Veronica and I had this double act
And my husband, Charlie, traveled round with us.
Now, for the last number in our act, 
We did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row
One, two, three, four, five, splits, spread eagles,
Back flips, flip flops,
One right after the other.
So this one night before the show we are down at the Hotel Cicero,
The three of us, boozin' 
Havin' a few laughs
And we run out of ice
So I go out to get some
I come back, open the door
And there's Veronica and Charlie 
Doing Number Seventeen
The spread eagle
Well, I was in such a state of shock, 
I completely blacked out, I can't remember a thing 
It wasn't until later, 
When I was washing the blood off my hands
I even knew they were dead

They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming all along
I didn't do it
But if I'd done it
How could you tell me that I was wrong?

They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming all along (they took a flower in its prime)
I didn't do it (and then they used it)
But if I'd done it
How could you tell me 
That I was wrong?

I loved Al Lipschitz
More than I can possibly say.
He was a real artistic guy...
Sensitive... A painter.
But he was always trying to find himself.
He'd go out every night looking for himself
And on the way
He found Ruth,
Gladys,
Rosemary and Irving
I guess you could say we broke up
Because of artistic differences.
He saw himself as alive
And I saw him dead.

The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum

They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming all along
'Cause if they used us ('cause if they used us)
And they abused us (and they abused us)

How could you tell us that we were wrong?

He had it coming (he had it coming)
He had it coming (he had it coming)
He only had himself to blame (he only had himself to blame)
If you'd have been there (if you'd have been there)
If you'd have seen it (if you'd have seen it)
I betcha you would have done the same!

Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal

Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
Wasted it all just to watch you go

And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me

Denn ich bin umwerfend, als würde ich Bowling spielen
Und von mir aus könnt ihr gerne auch den Banger fragen
Ich wusste wenn wir das hier durchziehen wird es Wellen schlagen
Früchte tragen, helle Farben, und wir halten weiterhin diese Welt in Atem

Ey außer Kena Amoa, die Zeit war nicht grad lustig so wie Omar Epps
Doch heute zeig ich meiner Oma Apps
Wer will mit Borak Stress, Mich dissen lange keine Kinder mehr
Denn das wird schmerzhaft wie durch den Schwanz ein Kind gebären
Antigaranti, deine Ohren werd ich dir mit der Hand lieber langziehen, du ganz fieser Junkie

Alle beten dass ich scheiter
Doch deswegen mach ich weiter
Von wegen es ist einfach
Doch Ich komme immer weiter
Sie beten, dass ich scheiter

Seit er im Game ist, ist alles anders, oh
Nicht, dass er Fame ist, ich meine den Standard
Wenn irgendjemand dich fragt, Ek
Dann steh nur auf, schau ihm ins Gesicht und sag

Er ist der freshste auf der Welt

Ich bin das Gegenteil von euch, Gegenteil von deutsch-
En MCs, denn sie sind das Gegenteil von neu
Jeden Tag auf's Neue kann ich von oben herab lachen
Hole Rapper auf den Boden der Tatsachen
Es tut mir leid, ihr habt kein Talent und
Das ist der Grund, warum euch keiner kennt
Nein, mein Friend, du darfst nicht den Song brennen
Ich sag' dir was du darfst mich den Don nennen
Darfst dich über mein gemachtes Geld wundern
Eko Fresh, ich bin das Achte Weltwunder

Dass dir keiner gefällt, kein Problem, ich feier' mich selbst
Weil keiner mich hält, ist mein Album-Niveau

Ey yo, sieh mich an und sag er ist angesagt
Hass mich wegen meiner arroganten Art
Doch vergleich mich nicht mit dem ganzen Standard
Mach mal ganz langsam, ich bin ganz anders
Du denkst wie kann sowas sein?
Wie kann dieser Thomas Stein sowas signen?
Oh nein, ihr könnt mich nicht vom Thron schubsen
Wenn ihr Glück habt, könnt ihr meinen Thron putzen
Ich rap wie der, der das Mic erfand
Und hab einen roten Anzug an wie der Weihnachtsmann
Ich bin der meistgehasste, weil mich die Meisten hassen
Ich kann mir leisten, was ich will, weil ich am meisten hustle
Ich weiß, was die Meisten aus Verzweiflung tun
Reden über mich, sonst hört ihnen keiner zu
Aus Mönchengladbach bis raus in die Welt
Check mich aus, ich bin jung und brauche das Geld

Es gibt 'n fetten Unterschied zwischen Rappern und MCs
Genau deshalb ist auch „Eksodus"" erschien'Du willst MC sein?

Ein MC kann über jegliche Them' rhymen
Bei 'nem Rapper handelt sich's ums klägliche Gegenteil
Denn die Rapper leben nur vom Trend
Aber ein MC von sei'm gottgegebenen Talent
Deshalb kannst du von 'nem Rapper auch den Hype schnell beenden
Beim MC liegt es in sein' eigenen Händen
Hör auf, meine Zeit zu verschwenden, ich bin busy-Bora
Und unterschreibe dir gerne auf dein Disney-Poster

Hasst meine Brüder, wir brauchen dich nicht
Und wenn ein Gladbacher Krieger dich draußen erwischt
Bekommst du Schwanz auf einmal Magengeschwüre
Nützt nichts, wenn du dich verschanzt, denn wir zerschlagen die Türe
Es ist alles beim Alten, ich bin immer noch Ek
Die ganzen Alben dieser Spinner sind doch whack
Ich bin ein Vulkan, der bald ausbrechen wird
Gerade wenn kein Bodyguard deine Haut retten wird

Wenn ich Nutten bang, wie die kaputte Sandy
Deine Frau geht öfter aus als ein kaputtes Handy
Mit Latinos im Casino deine Puta schlagen
Meine Fans tragen Goldketten wie Jugoslawen
Ich fick oft Popgruppen oder Ostblocknutten
Nichts wird sich ändern weil ich auf Cops noch spucke
Rapper labern viel, ich weiß, dass sie auch nicht stechen

Deine Frau macht für den Champion Suppe
Du willst 'nen Teil? Es war Champignon-Suppe
Du Bullen sagen, dass sie meinen Arsch für sauber halten
Du kleiner Lümmel kannst nicht mal dein Arschloch sauber halten

Von der Spielo ins Casino nach Las Vegas, Bitch
Und ficke dann mit meinem Kumpel Lars, Vega's Bitch
Ich seh, wie du Bastard grillst
Und frage mich, warum trägst du Bastard Grills
Was Index, ich mache dich munter, Monika
Du kommst mit Mundharmonika, ich im Mund der Monika
Komme zum Comet, mache die Sängerin von Juli an
Ich komme mit German Dream, du kommst nur mit Julian

Kids flehen mich an, bitte spitte, und ich spitte für Geld

Kids flehen mich an, bitte spitte, und ich spitte für Geld
F-A-R, ich ficke die Welt
Leg das Koka auf den Tisch, ich hab Bitches bestellt
Und habe jeden schon gedisst, heute diss ich mich selbst

Messlatte steigt, du Bastard, ich weiß
Diesen Song findet leider Casper nicht tight
Guck, die Westside im Hype, ihr habt keine Wahl, Mann
Treffe Katja Saalfrank und füll ihren Analtank
Kam mit den Jungs, jeder war gut betucht

Ich schütt den Benzinkanister in dein After, kleiner Pisser
Kripo, Polizist, sie seh'n am Horizont mein Mittelfinger
Es wird Ephedrin in Übermengen nicht integrierter, hyperaktiver
Asozialer, Crack verpackender Dealer
Ihr seid nur Kleingeldverdiener, ich bin ein Geldhai, ein Schieber
Ich scheiß auf Pokertische, wir sind reale Novoline-Spieler
Mann, ich verprügel euch alle, steck euch in Tüten und knalle
Den Baseballschläger an dein Kinn, reiß den Bandana weg, Kalle
Du voll verschwitzter konditiongeschwächter Hurensohn
Killer-Kombo, Köln-Berlin, schwarz-weiß für ein Hungerlohn
Du bist 'n Schwanz in deinem Arsch gewohnt
Ich bin's gewohnt, dass deine Mum mir einen runterhohlt
Hundesohn, du bist 'n zukünftiger Pädophiler
BGB, das ist der Sound für all die Waffenschieber
All die Kugeln reichen gegen uns nicht aus
Eko, hol den Raketenwerfer raus

Mein Messer ist geschliffen, machst du Faxen, dann gerät's dir
In die Rippen, wer will ficken, ich bin da
Dieser Junge ohne Seele mit dem Herzen aus Granit
Ich bin ein Krieger, guck, die AK geht klar, yipp
Ich bin sowas wie 'ne Plage, wie ein Tumor, der tief sitzt
Du bist gefickt, ich zersetze meine Gegner mit 'nem Blick
Guck, es sticht wie ein Blitz, der dich trifft, halt die Fresse
MAS bricht dem Klitschko das Genick
Denn wir leben ohne Regeln, meine Gegend, guck, sie brennt
Gangsters im Unterhemd, der Bulle rennt, guck, er rennt
Drive-By vom Benz aus, deine Gang bang ich auch
Ich nehm die kugelsichere Weste und die Panzerfaust
Und ich leg los, stürm dich so mit der Nase voller Koks
Wenn es sein muss, jag ich dich mit einem Bombengürtel hoch
Eure Kugeln reichen gegen uns nicht aus
Komm schon, Farid, hol den Raketenwerfer raus

Ey, mach mal Platz für den Newcomer 2011
Du rappst aus Leidenschaft, ha, ich bin nur geil auf das Geld
Wieder mal angeklagt, ich wurde zum König in der Nacht
Komm mit Eko Fresh und fick mit ihm die Königin der Nacht
Dein neues Album ist gefloppt und eure Fans wurden enttäuscht
Wir sind besser, man sieht es wie im Filter von einem Joint
Ihr Nutten hattet eure Chance, ich mach mehr draus und verdiene
Al Gear ist Untergrund wie die Bergbauer aus Chile
Rap mit Farid und Ekrem, du rappst mit Stefan und Peter
In meiner Gegend gibt's mehr Killer als in 'nem Track von Kollegah
Mit euren Disstracks wolltet ihr auf glaubwürdig machen
Eure Großmütter ficken, hm, ich glaub, würd ich machen
Nenn mich Milf Hunter, weil ich mich durch fast jede Stadt bums
Mein HIV-Test ist negativ wie ein Schwarzer im Abgrund,
Ich schick die Geld Eintreiber los, wenn Opfer mir was schulden
Und mein nächstes Ziel ist, ich ficke die Tochter eines Bullen

Deutschland sucht kein, nein, sie haben einen Superstar
Farid Bang, ich bin Feindbild der USA

Komme mit einer Gun und du hast in der Brust Patron'
Du Hurensohn, wir seh'n, wie du Homo rhymst
Und schreien: Boo, als wärst du Son-Gokus Feind
Ich hab ein großen Hype, bleibe straight Gangster
Während du Spasti nur einen Part von Kay bekamst
Dass dieser Laas kein G, sondern ein Skater war
Ja, das liegt auf der Hand wie ein Breakdancer
Ich fick ENAs, denn ich bin dauernd am Koksen
Und hab ein Rad ab wie deutsche Autos in Polen
Deine Frau oben ohne, ich bin Bulletproof

Und einen draufgesetzt als wäre es der Elektrische Stuhl
Hör zu
Komme in deine Villa mit Freezy rein nisste mich ein GD style
Komme mit Cem goldener Benz ficke die Rapper sie folgen dem Trend
Eyy ich bekomm' nur fürchtende Blicke, den ich spiel mit dem Feuer, wie Zirkus-Artisten
Mal im Anzug mal in Jeans mal in Frankfurt mal in Wien
Ich bin ein Schwarzkopf so wie du ihn auf Schampooflaschen siehst
Alter hast du was zu ziehen? Fick die Kripo, fick die Drogen
Ich hau Klitschko jetzt zu Boden, ich bin Vito Corleone ah
Wir sind uns sehr ähnlich wie erzählen von der Straße
Doch was uns unterscheidet ich Lebe was ich sage
Rapper reden doch ich schlage, gegen ihre Nasen
Ich bring German Dream zurück und die Labels kommen blasen

Ihr könnt es nicht fassen, das hab ich in ein paar Jahren erbaut
Leiste den Widerstand, man, ich bring überragenden Sound

Gd die Kingz Freezey gewinnt
Kann man mal hör'n ob die Dreamer hier sind
Schreibe soviel, reime mit Stil
Aufrufe Steigen auf meinem Profil
Bleibe so Real Nutten im Leib, Frippy die Mic zum Beat in den Scheiß
Scheine mein Ziel ratter dich weg packe den Ek in Plattengeschäft
Ein Camp aufgemacht, Farid Bang rausgebracht
Ein Straßenjungen genommen und ein Champ drauß gemacht
Hab sein Zugticket genommen und ein Benz drauß gemacht
All die Hater und Fronter ich hab Fans draus gemacht
Summer cem was geht ab du bist der nächste der kommt EK Der Don
Ich führe jetzt mein Label gekonnt
Ich bin wie eine Get wie eine Get mit tilla tiquila und wieder im Chat
Dein Liebhaber meint das ich Widerlich rapp? Er sieht aber ein es gibt niemand wie EK
Der typ von der Mac im Bundesgebiet, pumpe den Beats verdunkelte gees, die Beats im gepäck
Schon einige Mal, es bleibt keine Wahl nur der Heile Grahl
Früher nur belächelt endlich etabliert
Ich fühl euch nicht so wie mein Handy nicht vibriert

Ich schick dich in die Walachei - Reitsport 
Ich sitze auf dem Wallach high

Yo, Eko, let's go

Ekrem, late man, ihr habt Style wie [Dre, Cent ?]
Ich rap nur damit whacke Crews mal checken wie es geht, denn
Ich fühl mich wie zuhaus, Füße auf die Couch
Was macht der Beruf? Schöne Grüße an die Frau
Man sagte mir: ""Niemals wird dein Label verkaufen!""
Und riet mir, ich solle meine Label verkaufen
Ich knack die zehntausend, dann die 50, dann die 100
Ich bin der Verpeilte, den man künstlerisch bewundert
Legenden reden nicht drüber, dass sie 'ne Legende sind
Deswegen schweig ich bis ich zu Ende bin
Menschenskind, was ist Freezy nur für ein Schwein
Ich miete mir einen Schrein und schließe mich darin ein
Der Fiesling, die Nummer Eins, ich erhalte jetzt Bares
Lass mich kurz herab zu rappen, drop das Album des Jahres
Ich halte die Fahne und bin mir selber manchmal nicht ganz sicher
Wer ist die coole Sau die da rappt? Ach das bin ich ja

War gar nicht mal so schlecht, Ek
Aber jetzt
Rheydt West
Summer Cem
Yeah, Yeah

Ey, meine Soloraps sind Rarität
Ich stehe zu German Dream wie manche dieser Rapper zu der Homosexualität
Mein Logo steht für Qualität, der ober-freshe Kapitän
Und an 'nem guten Tag frag ich dich oberflächlich mal ""Was geht?""
Und weil der deutsche Traum dein Vermögen schluckt
Komm ich in dein Haus und räume auf wie der Trödeltrupp
Tötet uns, oder ihr müsst ohne Gegenwehr verschwinden
Denn nach einer Faust siehst du, wie die Leberwerte sinken
Ich würd' lügen, wenn ich sage, ich kriege nur Liebe
Diese miese Nutte, die sich Mucke nennt, passt zu dieser kaputten Welt
Kein Bastard, der mich unten hält
Denn Summer der Hammer, macht in Sekundenschnelle das Para
Hier in der Unterwelt
Höre die Hunde bellen, doch sie können Summer nicht sehen

Farid Bang

Gangster-Sound, ich komm aus dem Gefängnis raus
Nehme die Gun, gebe dir dann eine Schelle, wow
Und dann zieh ich Koka mit meinem Bruder Curse
Doch ich bin net süchtig, wie Computernerds
Ich beschütte euch mit Benzin, Kokain im Benz zieh'n
Ich bin so oft drin, Alter, ich könnte in den Benz ziehen
Lege los, nehme Koks, ficke jetzt Mädels
Und mach 'ne gute Figur, wie Fitnesstraining
Rapper, die Hitler ähneln, laufen mit Leibwächtern rum
Ich bring Einbrecher, nein, besser drei Rapper um
Viele Bullen wollen mich verhaften und ficken
Doch wissen, sie sind mir nicht gewachsen, wie Titten
Ich schlage zu, und sehe wie sich keiner der Bullen wehrt
Was wärt ihr Bullen wert, wenn ihr keine Bullen wärt?
Und jetzt sagen Bitches, die auf den Straßen strichen
Farid Bang ist zum Anbeißen, wie Zahngebisse
Oooooh

Yo, war cool, Farid
Yeah
Und wenn ihr denkt, der Widerstand geht nur bis NRW
Dann liegt ihr falsch
Es geht auch nach Berlin
Yeah, Sultan Hengzt

Ich bin wieder da, das heißt, Rapper blasen wieder Pimmel
Oder kommen zum Battle als getarnte Tunte oder Krüppel
Damit sie von mir halb so schlimm vernichtet werden
Rapper halten wieder Händchen, ich verzichte gerne
Ich bin das Alpha und das Omega
Du bringst die Alpha noch, du Komiker
Vergiss mal battlen, ich schlag dir die Fresse ein
Und lass dich nackig, renn, so wie der Osterhase
Ich renn in's Hyatt rein und renn raus wie ein Kofferpage
Yeah, Eh, halt diese Penner mir vom Leib
Ich fick auf diese Szene, Rapper sind nur halbe Hemden, wie vom Hulk
Und rennen, so wie die Hertha-Spieler
Deine Freundin macht im Block öfters die Runde als ein Bernhardiner
Lass deine Hände schon unten, oder ich brech sie, du Tunte
Du willst ein Battle? Deine Mutter wird von Messi getunnelt, du Fotze

Finden Blut an meiner Jeans, weil ich auf Hurensöhne schieß!
Cruise in meinem Jeep, der Kofferraum wird aufgemacht
Und du siehst die Walter drin wie im Frauenknast
Und es sollte für Rapper besser laufen
Doch wenn sie mich sehn sollten die Rapper besser laufen!
Sieh mich auf Postern!

Bring ich ein Psycho-Part, ich bin ein Psychopath

Mein ganzes Leben labern sie mich voll, so Wichser wie du
Ich war der erste der gedisst hat, der letze der noch stehen bleibt
Mein Label German Dream von jetzt bis in die Ewigkeit

Wir sind wie Terroristen mit Plänen für ein Anschlag
Nein, viel mehr, das Label mit dem Handschlag
Wie der deutsche Traum, wie der German Dream
Ich hab' das Motto auf P.Diddy's T-Shirt gesehn'
Ihr wollt die Geschichte, ich erzähl' auch jetzt die Scheiße
Ich wollt's eigentlich nur meinem Ex-Labelchef beweisen
Früher war der Dream-Sound R'n'B angehaucht
Es war 'ne andere Zeit, doch wir waren vielen weit voraus
Damals noch mit Cetin und Ramsi Aliani
Brachen alle Frauenherzen, Anzug von Armani
Manuel hatte alles, Aussehen und Talent
Nur künstlerisch jemanden gebraucht, der ihn lenkt
In einer Zeit, wo jeder meine Singles auswendig kennt
Setzte ich schon damals einen Ausländertrend
Trotzdem waren wir von heute noch um Längen entfernt
Durch G-Stizzle hab' ich Capkekz kennengelernt
Ich hab' ne Menge gelernt, hatte Freunde hinter mir
Ins erste GD-Album vierzigtausend Euro investiert
Alles nur damit das Label mit dem Handschlag released
Meine Mannschaft der Dream, tja und dann kam der Beef

Ich war der erste, (der erste) mein Diss-Track ist Kult
Das ganze Land war im Beef und nur ich war dran schuld
Sogar G-Unit ist out, German Dream wir sind in
Alter Knie, küss den Ring
Es ist Freezy der King (Freezy der King)

Weißt du noch, du hast mein Label ausgelacht
Heute haben wir dein Label zu Staub gemacht

Summer ist ein Dreamer, wir sind alle Dreamer

Was hab' ich gehört? Du traust Freezy nicht mehr viel zu
Mein ganzes Leben labern sie mich voll, so Wichser wie du
Ich war der erste der gedisst hat, der letze der noch stehen bleibt
Mein Label German Dream von jetzt bis in die Ewigkeit

Ich war der erste, der ein' Disstrack mit 'nem Video gedroppt hat
Heute ist es Standard, damals riss man mir den Kopf ab
Ständig unterwegs oder hängen im Café
Lernte ich einen kleinen Jungen kennen namens Kay
Labelchef E.K, Manager und Trainer
Wenig später kam die Grembranx-Ära
Bist du für mich oder gegen mich, pro oder contra
Durch die Straße Hakan Abi und die Homies von La Honda
Komm klar, ihr wollt uns den Respekt nicht gönnen
Mein Label steht für Kanacks, die aber auch rappen können
Doch die hiesige Hip Hop-Presse will uns nicht dabei haben
Ihr müsst uns nicht heiraten, aber mit uns leben
Urban-Scene, German Dream, Underground Tag und Nacht
Die großen Labels haben unsern Hammer-Sound nachgemacht
Aber whoa, wartet ab wir übernehmen die Nation
Trennen uns nicht wegen irgendeiner Mädchenaktion
Gottverdammt wir sind der Burner, interessant auch für den Hörer
Ich weiß noch ganz genau, ich hatte Summer Cem am Hörer
Ey yo, Ek mir hat gerad jemand in der Disko vorgerappt
Sein Name ist Farid, ich glaub' der disst sich ins Geschäft

Freitag ist Stichtag, also ficke ich deine Mutter

Danach check ich das Internet nach ner Facebook-Slut

Ihr könnt weiter cyphern, hier kommt das Bestattungsinstitut

Doch dachte schon an Para, als Michael noch schwarz war
Mach Tausend Männer platt, häng mit Frauenhändlern ab
Die dich weghauen werden, falls du Außenstände hast
Viele der Fotzen sind leider viel zu sentimental
Deshalb mache ich Psycho-Terror und ficke sentimental
Früher war ich immer der, der kein Visum bekommt
Heute heisst es Gucci, Prada oder Yves Saint-Laurent
Es ist Summers, es ist Farids, es ist Eks Welt

Ich bin euer Vater, Doppelreim-Erfinder
Gerne wollt ihr es verhindern, ihr seid trotzdem meine Kinder
Ich will euch zurückbringen, als es noch keine Bravo Hip-Hop gab
Wo man als echter Rapper mit der Bravo nicht mal sprach
Und ich hab für euch kleinen Fotzen dann das Eis gebrochen
Bleibt zu hoffen, ihr Zeitgenossen habt die Zeit genossen
Die Art, wie ihr eure Punchlines schreibt,
ist eindeutig meine väterliche Handarbeit, ich bin dein Daddy
Du spielst mir euer Demo vor
Und ich kenne jetzt schon jedes Wort
Die Kanacken-Rapper wollen mir was von Draufgängern erzähln'
Ich war hier, da hat man noch nicht einen Ausländer gesehn'
Man ihr braucht euch nicht zu schämen
Für eure Existenz
Ihr verkauft euch für's System und wart Eko-Fans
Willst du wissen was der ganze Song zu heißen hat?
Nur der Aufbau deines Raps kommt aus meinem Sack

Ich bin euer Vater
Jeder weiß Ek ist am Mic,
Guck mal meine Szene wie sie wächst und gedeiht
Ich bin euer Vater
Denn nach deiner ersten Rasur
Schenk ich dir noch eine wertvolle Uhr
Ich bin euer Vater
Mach mal nicht auf Harten hier, du Fickfehler
Lehrte dich das Fahren ohne Stützräder
Ich bin euer Vater
Solang deine Füße unter meinem Tisch sind
Kannst du dir ja vorstellen, wer ich bin
Ich bin euer Vater

Bringe euch das Essen auf den Tisch
Das Haus in dem du bist, die Couch auf der du sitzt
Ignoranz, Arroganz, das sind meine Bereiche
Brachte Deutschland bei das Gleiche auf das Gleiche zu reimen
Einige meinen, ich hab den aller Ersten Disstrack gemacht
Wegen mir hat das ganze Land auf Dipset gemacht
Denn der Man hier hat die vielen Fans rekrutiert
Auf die euer Geschäftsmodell basiert
Ich bin euer Vater und wollte jetzt euer'n Arsch retten
Jeder euer Gangster kann einen Text von mir nachrappen
Denn sie haben früher vor dem Spiegel gestanden
Und davon geträumt auch ein Hit wie Freezy zu landen
Aber nix da, ich inspiriere Leute die dich inspirieren
Und du kopierst dann heute die die mich kopiern', hör mal
Ich gebe dir 'nen väterlichen Rat
Viele wollten Rapper werden heute leben sie vom Staat (oh shit)

Ich bin euer Vater
Jeder weiß Ek ist am Mic,
Guck mal meine Szene wie sie wächst und gedeiht
Ich bin euer Vater
Denn nach deiner ersten Rasur
Schenk ich dir noch eine wertvolle Uhr
Ich bin euer Vater
Mach mal nicht auf Harten hier, du Fickfehler
Lehrte dich das Fahren ohne Stützräder
Ich bin euer Vater
Solang deine Füße unter meinem Tisch sind
Kannst du dir ja vorstellen, wer ich bin
Ich bin euer Vater

Ihr seid mit meiner Mucke großgeworden
Deutscher Rap ist Pubertär und will sich nicht unterordnen
2002 Habt ihr Ek-Stil bekommen
Zehn Jahre später und immer noch leben sie davon
Diesen väterlichen Song hab ich eingerappt
Du weißt doch Ek der deutsche Künstler mit den meisten Tracks
Und du siehst ich war immer fleißig
Leute covern meine Songs ich bin noch nicht mal 30
Ich bin euer Vater, nenn' mich einfach Ek zu dem O
Bitte sehr ich brachte Rap zu The Dome
Pisser heute könnt ihr dort sein steht's auf meinem Rücken
Mit meinen Federn schmücken um die Medien zu entzücken
Geht euch alle ficken Ihr habt nicht meine Klasse
Kleiner wenn du lieb bist können wir Drachen steigen lassen
Ich bring dich auch ins Bett, der King in diesem Dreck
Ich bin's Ek, ihr seid alle meine Kinder wie ihr rappt, oh yes

Ich bin euer Vater
Jeder weiß Ek ist am Mic,
Guck mal meine Szene wie sie wächst und gedeiht
Ich bin euer Vater
Denn nach deiner ersten Rasur
Schenk ich dir noch eine wertvolle Uhr
Ich bin euer Vater
Mach mal nicht auf Harten hier, du Fickfehler
Lehrte dich das Fahren ohne Stützräder
Ich bin euer Vater
Solang deine Füße unter meinem Tisch sind
Kannst du dir ja vorstellen, wer ich bin

Eko Fresh,"Als ich damals in mei'm Kinderzimmer Packs verpackte
Ich nix zu Essen, doch ein Messer hatte
Und auf der Street hing, weil ich nicht V.I.P. war
Da kam auch keine Gina Lisa
Ich muss aufsteh'n, gut ausseh'n, das Leben ist ein Laufsteg
Ich mach es wie Xatar, ohne dass ich in den Bau geh
Kein Ausweg, jemand da draußen zinkt gerade
Deshalb find' ich die SIM-Karte wie damals Bin-Laden
Düsseldorf, Nutte, box oder stirb
Die Stadt hat 10 Mille, Kombi offen bei mir
Siehst du mich im Bett deiner Mama
Bravo oder Juice - Direkt auf dem Cover
Auf der Yacht im Lambo mit Bitches auf Marbella
Mit Cora Schuhmacher und Michaela Schäfer
Verticke dieses Baida, Benz oder U-Bahn
Farid Bang, A.K.A. der Beste nach 2Pac

Ich bin ein Träumer
Schon als ich neun war wusst' ich genau, ich werd' kein Verkäufer
Ich bin ein Träumer, der sich immer treu war
Echte Freundschaft zwischen all den Heuchlern
Ich bin ein Träumer, zog um die Häuser
Lebte mein' Traum, was ich nie bereut hab
Lass dich nicht verbiegen von Leuten, die dich leugnen
Hör auf zu Reden, fang' an zu träumen

Eko Fresh, als ich damals in der Schule war
Hätt' ich nie gedacht, in paar Jahren werd' ich Superstar
Meine Lehrer sagten mir: ""Guck mal, da träumt er wieder!
Im Leben helfen dir auch nicht deine Deutschrap-Lieder!
Du bist ein Sitzenbleiber, denn du bist gescheitert!
Und man schickt dich weiter zum Fabrikarbeiter!""
Damals, die ganzen Freunde und Leute sagten mir nur:
""Träume sind Schäume"", doch damit nicht genug
Denn da hatt' ich schon' Hit, Mann
Waren sie beschäftigt, mir zu sagen, was ich nicht kann:
""Du darfst nicht das machen! Du darfst nicht dies machen!
Ihr werdet's nie schaffen mit euren GD-Sachen!""
Ich wollte nur nochmal Top-10 geh'n mit eurer Kraft
Kennst du den Deutschen Satz ""Wovon träumst du nachts?""?
Heut hab ich's geschafft, muss kei'm was beweisen
Lass dich einfach nicht bescheißen
Daran scheitern halt die Meisten, aber nicht wir

Ich bin ein Träumer

Lebte mein' Traum, was ich nie bereut hab
Lass dich nicht verbiegen von Leuten, die dich leugnen
Hör auf zu Reden, fang' an zu träumen

Heut muss ich nur Geld zähl'n, Mathe war für'n Arsch
Schon zu meiner Schulzeit hatte ich's geahnt
An alle meine Lehrer: Schönen Gruß, Mann
Es fühlt sich gut an, denn ich komm groß raus - Stuhlgang
Der beste Beweis ist SCD die 1
Ich bleib Dreamer, während du bei einem Dreckslabel signest
Loyal sag Tag 1 bis hin zum Grabstein
Du suchst deine kleine Schwester? Ich bring sie g'rad Heim
Das Bellydancen fehlt dir, die Helly Hansen steht dir
Wir zeigen euch mal kurz, wie deutscher Gangsterrap geprägt wird
Denn immer wenn du hörst Farid, Ek und Summer zum Beat
Weißt du genau, das ist Presslufthammermusik
Machst du faxen, ficke ich persönlich deine Pappnase
Du bist der King, aber vom Königreich der Bastarde
Es geht nie wieder zurück, nur noch nach oben, Dreamer
Denn wir ficken diese Welt - Fukushima

Und es macht dann „Bam Bam“
Vom Düsseldorfer Bahndamm
Ey, yeah, Alles oder Nix

Mach keine Politik mit Xatar
Sonst verlierst du noch dein Gesicht so wie Michael Jackson
Wegen Zinkern wurd' ich observiert
Sie wollten mir was anhängen wie ein Juwelier
Ja, der Staat hat mehr Augen als ein Pfau, man
Glaubt es kaum ein Freund war ein V-Mann
Sodass ich im Knast dressed in Ralph Lauren saß
Weil ich tickte an den Ralph Lauren [?] - in großen Mengen
Ich fand meinen Anteil von One Million dufte
Wie Frauen wenn ich nach One Million dufte
Tanz nicht im Club, ah, zu viele Neider
Wollen mir an den Kragen wie mein Schneider
Und während du an Disko-Türen mit Disko-Tieren diskutieren willst
Investiere ich
In die erste Liga, wo ich Spieler türke, isss
Aber nur möglich wenn der Spieler Türke ist

Ich vertick in der Gegend Drogen
Tausch Geld gegen Drogen
Doch das Drogendezernat ist leider gegen Drogen
Ich bleibe der, der hier draußen das Crack tickt
Und du, du bist nach eigener Aussage kräftig
Doch ich boxe dich nach dieser Aussage kräftig
Ich ficke deine Mutter ist sehr aussagekräftig
Genug gespittet, es ist Zeit, dass ich paar Mütter fick
Ich bin erfolgreicher als du, du wirst nicht zurückgedisst
„Bangermusik“, meine Gang zerlegt Feinde
Ich ficke deine Mum, denn die Schlampe bläst scheiße
Gs werden gesign't, denn
Ich habe ein Ohr auf der Street, wie van Gogh zu Lebzeiten
Bleib Extasy-Ticker und Hennessy-Trinker

Die Baretta macht klick klack, ich trage sie im Schritt

Du bist Gangster und machst Para im Kölner Hyatt
Ich führ dich aufs Glatteis, wie die Kölner Haie
Ach du Scheiße, bums nicht mein Kopf
Sonst beißt du ins Gras, wie ein hungriger Bock
Wo sind die Scheine?
Du stehst in der Kreide
Wie der Kommissar am Tatort dieser Leiche
Dem du sagst, du willst deine Rechte wahrnehmen
Ihr könnt beide mal meine Rechte wahrnehmen
Ah, Xatar ballert auf die Straßen
Aus S-Klassen siehst du Babas mit Scharfen
Nach dieser Packung hilft kein Krankenhaus
Wähl 11-8-8-0, weil du ein Pfarrer brauchst
Jetzt fragt ihr nach wie ich Party mach
Meine Eier sind VIP wie Kaviar
Xatar hat den Durchbruch erlangt, uh
Durch die Nase dieser Playboy Schlampe

Ah, 1983 erblickte ich das Licht der Welt
Schon damals sagt ich, „Fick die Welt!“
„Gib mir Geld!“
Bruder, Kopf hoch!
Du weißt, diese Welt ist gottlos
Ich kann nicht mit ansehen, dass du in 'nem Loch wohnst
Die Cops holen Xatar auf den Radar
Doch ich mach seinen Nachlass einen Altar
Alter wir sind Ausländer Allstars
Bonner und Kalker machen alles klar
Das Resultat heut ist
Dass der Staat euch fickt
Auch wenn ich weiß, wo das Zahngold ist
Ich sag euch nichts
Denn ich ficke eure Ermittlungen

Eko Fresh,"Ihr wollt Punchlines und Vergleiche?
Kein Problem, ich hab früher mal den ganzen Scheiß verbreitet
Das sind 101 Bars, Junge, rein in deinen Arsch
Wofür Rapper sich so anstrengen, einfach nur zum Spaß
Ich hab mich schon bewiesen und mach' es nicht so viel
Aber Fuck, ich bin der Freezy also lass uns bisschen spiel'n
Du brauchst dringend das Gespitte, sinnloses Gedisse
Kein Problem, höre einfach meiner Stimme zu und nicke

Ich find' die Schuhe deiner Frau von Puma kacke
Sie sehen so beschissen aus wie Pumakacke
Auf der Welt gibt es all die Schuhe
Warum trägt sie denn ausgerechnet Aldischuhe?
Standstreifen, sie kommt meinem Wagen nah
(Wie nah?) ich rieche schon die Vagina
Bar für Bar ist mein Rap signifikant
Und deshalb findet sie meinen Zippy pikant
Sie sagt: Eko mach' mal tausend Lines
Kein Problem, kauf den Scheiß, bring mich auf die eins.
Die Kanacken-Rapper wollen alle Padischah spielen
Und Backpacker auf der Party lieber Schach spielen
Ich bin anders als ihr alle, fick' deinen Rettungsversuch
Sogar Leute, die mich biten rappen besser als du
Ich stink' nach Fame, ich hatte ihn mit sechzehn schon
Ek zum O, ich lebe nur nach Perfektion
Nach einer Weile teil' ich deine Eingeweide in die Einzelteile
Beim Schreiben bleiben meine Zeilen wie in Stein gemeißelt
Heilige Scheiße, dir fehlt Persönlichkeit
Du kannst dir 'ne Scheibe abschneiden - Dönerfleisch
Mein Königreich - ich seh' eure Kinder flüchten
Und schieß' Bullen in den Kopf als würd' ich Rinder züchten
Sag meinem Kumpel nimm' den Audi Jens
Denn der Freezy gewährt heute eine Audienz
Du hast ein Problem? - Das ist dein Problem
Du kannst weiter an der Seite stehen und Kleingeld zählen
Es ist Drück' auf Play, denn wir gehen mit der Zeit
Sag, wo sind jetzt meine Feinde hin? Sie gehen mit der Zeit
Ich bin eigentlich ganz bodenständig
Doch meine Gegner küssen den Boden ständig
Aus paar Strophen englisch wird kein Rapstar du Assi
Fick die Dre Beats, meine haben bessere Quali
Ich stehe vor dir, du lachst und denkst:
Wie schön es ist, dass dein Vater dir Beachtung schenkt
Doch ich lass' dich hängen, du hast noch ganz viele Fragen
Aber ich mach' mich vom Acker so wie Landwirte abends
Du weißt, ich rap' in anderen Verhältnissen
Wäre ich bei den anderen würd' ich mich selbst dissen
Euch in die Hälse ficken und mit deiner Alten beginnen
Ihr bringt doch alle nur ein Album um ein Album zu bringen
Der German King, Rap-Gott, die neue Eins
Keine Angst, Germanwings stellt noch paar Leute ein
Krieg' Geld um auf deutsch zu reimen
Das kommt mir zugute und ich leg' mehr Frauen flach als Bestattungsinstitute
Alter du verblutest, ich pinkel auf dein FUBU, Shirt
Ich bin ein G, Punkt - wie hinten in der Mumu (Word!)
Mein Klingelton ist so pervers, er passt auf die Beschreibung:
Auf dicke Hose machen, so wie Astronautenkleidung.
Der Hustler Nummer eins und badabing, badabum
Bring' ich euch dringend um wie Kim Jong-un.
Ich bin der Oberlehrer, also follow' dem Leader
Sie will Boras Sperma also swallow' die Diva
Du klingst danach, dass du's gerne in den Hintern magst
Und dir damit die Zeit vertreibst wie ein Print-Verlag
Fick deine Soundcloud-Seite und dein Demo-Reel
Nur wenn du Sound klaust, weißt du ist dein Demo real
Eyo Ek ist der Boss, ihr seid Lebenszeitverschwendung
Ich krieg' Schecks mit der Post, Jungs, das Gegenteil von Pfändung
Ich spiel' Mega Drive, Nintendo, 8Bit, Bruder, chill
Währenddessen riecht dein Atem nach Bitburger Pils
Ich bin der Herzog, der über dich herzog
Du bist nur der Lümmel, der mal irgendwann hierher zog
Ihr seid sehr broke, ich nehm nur kurz Bezug
Auf euch, ihr seid mir nicht burschikos genug
Jetzt sieht man wieder dich Otto prahlen
Aber du hast kein Gewehr wie die Ziehung der Lottozahlen
Dein Frau will ins Jacuzzi gehen
Denn ich halte sie auf Trab so wie Gucchi Mane
Man kann die Zeit nicht zurückdrehen
Aber beim Scheißen gebückt stehen
Jeder kann zur Zeit auf die 5 gehen
Hab' dein Album durchgebrochen
Nach jeder Punchline ziehst du ein Gesicht, als hättest du grad 'nen Furz gerochen
Kurz gesprochen, Ihr seid oberarm, ihr Wichser
Ich führe euch aufs Glatteis wie ein Rodelbahnbesitzer
Weil du deinen Oberarm gespritzt hast, zeigst du deinen Sixpack
Dass du G bist, willst du mir jetzt weismachen wie Tip-Ex
Die Cam läuft, ich schlage in dein Rappergesicht
Und zeige euch den Niederschlag wie der Wetterbericht
Also nerv' nicht du Arschgeige, ich hab Nerven wie Drahtseile
Weshalb ich 'nen herrlichen Part schreibe
Und ich werf' auf die Dartscheibe mit deinem Poster drauf
Gebe keinen Fick so wie Klosterfrauen
Steig' in den Porsche mit Cükrü und Estebàn
Und zieh' mir vor dem Frühstück die erste Bahn
Ekrem ist euer Vater, der beste der je da war
In den Charts Neueinsteiger wie ein Testwagenfahrer
Wen würd' ich gerne dissen, man die Liste ist lang
Das nächste Mal wenn du mich siehst, küss' meine Hand
Ihr seid verwirrt und gespannt, was wird Ek zu unseren Singles sagen?
Dicker, ihr seid nicht mehr wert als Dreck unter meinem Fingernagel
Verdien' auf den Straßen so ziemlich herausragend
Dank riesen Verkaufszahlen mit biblischen Ausmaßen
Siehst du die Rauchschwaden? Ihr Gewohnheitskiffer
Hängt nur broke auf Twitter doch jetzt kommt der Yolo Ficker
Seid euch totsicher, es ist eine Weile her
Da gab' ich einen Fick, doch jetzt geb ich einen mehr
Ihr könnt mich nicht beeindrucken mit Bars, die ihr schreibt
Ihr könnt nur reingucken wenn ich meine Arschbacken spreiz'

Und ich hab keinen Bock, dass sich dieses Kack-Datum verschiebt
Ich muss im Studio, aber ein's der Lieder noch recorden
Was du heute kannst besorgen, das verschiebe nicht auf morgen
Yes man, ich lauf zur S-Bahn und denk mir innerlich, warum tue ich mir den Stress an?
Auf dem Weg schreib ich heimlich meinen Text
Damit keiner mich entdeckt, trag ich ein weißes Cap
Doch zu spät, ein paar Jugendliche haben mich erkannt
„Eko, altes Haus"" fragen Sie mich dann“ wann kommt denn dein neues Album raus?""
Wenn die wüssten, dass sie mich grad davon abhalten zu releasen
Doch ich mach keine Anstalten das zu vertiefen
Denn gerade wenn man mit sowas nicht gerechnet
Artet es spontan aus zu einer Foto-Session
Ich muss raus, steigt zwei Haltestellen früher aus, egal
Denn das Album zu verschieben wäre überaus fatal
Und in dem Moment ruft meine Frau an
""Wenn du wieder das Futter für den Hund vergisst, dann bin ich sauer""
O.K., und während ich zum Penny geh für Pedigree
Denk ich warum ich überhaupt das Handy mitnehm
Oh mein Gott, ich werd wohl nie diesen Track einrappen
Nix und Niemand kann noch meine Deadline retten
Aber scheiß drauf ich lauf als ob es um mein Leben geht
Und schreib einfach weiter unterwegs im Stehen
Völlig außer Atem, doch dort ist es ja, man

Die sind einfach nur bescheuert. 
Also gestern Abend hab ich 'n echten MC gesehen. 
Der Typ verdient 'ne Chance.“

Ihr denkt, Ihr seid Drake und macht jetzt ein' auf „YOLO“
Sowas nannten wir mal fake oder allerhöchstens homo
Gestern wart Ihr Hip Hop, heute seid Ihr SWAG
Und die, die Ihr bewundert, Leute, das sind Fags
Scheiß auf enge Hosen, Rapper tragen breit
Ich fing an zu rappen, da war Techno unser Feind
Was für Gucci Mane? Was für Soulja Boy?
Ich hab nicht für Rap gekämpft, damit heute sowas läuft
Was für Chief Keef und Waka Flocka Flame?
Eure Beats sind weak und das könnt Ihr Motherfuckers seh'n
Ein abgefucktes Game, Abfall USA
Und verwirrte deutsche Artists machen es noch nach
Ich mein', einmal für ein Mixtape ist OK
Aber doch nicht auf ein Album, um dann Clips dazu zu dreh'n
Das bereut Ihr sicher, ich bleib' bei den Neunzigern
90 BPM, was für 808, Ihr Toy-Ficker?

Was für Trap-Musik? Macht mal Rap-Musik
Echte Beats sind leider tot, Alter, rest in peace
Eure Sounds sind irgendwelcher Dreck aus dem Computer
Ich find' Little B wack und bringe sie jetzt Ek to the future
Was für Maybach-Musik? Macht mal einfach Musik
Jedes scheiß Lied klingt heutzutage gleich auf Repeat
Ich komm' noch aus der Zeit, als Rappen ein Beruf war
? ich bringe das Game Ek to the future

Wat sind denn dat für Beats? Was für YMCMB?
Die Helden meiner Zeit waren Pac und BIG
Damals wurde noch gerappt, es wurde nicht getrappt
Zeigt mal Eure Skills, Junge, vorbildlich wie Ek
Ich mach's für die Straße, Ihr macht's für die Disse
In Euer'n Leoparden-Jeans seht Ihr aus wie Bitches
Was „Down South?“ Nächstes Jahr seid Ihr out
Aber ich hab dann immer noch den angesagten Sound
Denn was ich mach ist zeitlos, und Ihr seid bloß
Paar Jungs, die sich dann fragen ""Was ist mit dem Hype los?""
Ek Fresh, ich hab mich in Cyphers geburnt
Und dafür geblutet, um dann heute Tyga zu hör'n
Eyo scheiß auf die Nerds, ob Emo oder Hipster
Fick auf's Radio, ich mag Ego-Rap, Ihr Wichser
Wer willst Du sein mit dein' Flo Rida-Beats?
Wer will schon so ein Release, Du Sohn einer Bitch?

Doch heute kommt jeder Schwanz ins Business
Der irgendwie einen neuen Tanz erfindet
Was für 2 Chainz? Ihr könnt zuseh'n, ich bin true to the Game und zu fame
Ek der Mack, ich baller' das SWAG weg und deine Bitch gibt meiner Crew ???
Mann, dein A$AP Rocky-Verse, er ist eh as fuck, ich schwör's
Du rappst Playback, hab's gehört auf der Stage in Rugby-Shirts
Es ist klar, ein Money Boy weiß es nicht besser
Doch was ist mit den meisten der Rapper? Seid ihr deppert?
Kein Schwein feiert den Scheiß, den Germany, klar
Ich respektiere keine Männer mit 'nem Burberry-Schal
Und zwar nicht, weil ich der Härteste bin
Sondern Rhymes aus dem Herzen bring' mit Schmerzen von inn'
Und du rappst über Mädchen im Club

Hör doch auf, ich hab dich zu dem Job nie gezwung'n
Ob du da bist oder nicht, ist eh gehopst wie gesprung'n
Es ist dei'm Boss nie gelung'n, professionell zu sein
Oder was fällt dir ein, sowas für Geld zu rhym'n
Wenn Ferris und ich dich kriegen, lehr ich dich Pic zu fliegen
Senk dein Haupt, Legendensound, schwer ist nicht mitzukriegen
Wir ham' mehrere Hits geschrieben und Beats abgebrannt
Da bist du noch mit der Schippe über'n Spielplatz gerannt

Du hast alles außer Kontrolle

Du wirst allein geboren und du stirbst auch allein

Es gibt kein ander'n Freak wie mich, der noch atmet
Ich bin ein Freak am Morgen, ich bin ein Freak am Abend

Ich bin der Schlachthof mit Bolzenschuss für Riesenochsen
Sorry, ich dachte Mann gegen Mann, denn ich rieche Fotzen
Ihr denkt, es geht mal locker von der Sonnenbank ans Mikro
Doch echte MCs opfern euch, willkommen zu der Freakshow

Yeah, Ferris MC plus Nine plus Eko Fresh
Die Tsunami-Welle spült alle alten Spuren im Sand weg
Euer Rap-Image ist 'ne Erfindung wie dieser Weihnachtsmann
Nur Kinder hören zu und glauben wahrscheinlich dran
Karre voll, ich push Kilos höchstens auf der Hantelbank
Ich hab Pusher gepusht, bis ich in U-Haft kam
Erzählt mal weiter eure Märchen wie die Gebrüder Grimm
So lustig wie Dieter Hallervorden, Palimm palimm
Yo, ihr Guttenberg-MCs bereichert euch durch Plagiate
Zu viel Imitate existier'n allein durch unsere Zitate
Und die Gangster-Rapper von der Sesamstraße
Machen jetzt auch Politik, leere Worte ohne Taten
Mein Rücktritt vom Rücktritt, das Kettensägen-Massaker
Ich rede selten übers Geld, ich bin der Geldmacher
Nach meiner Reinkarnation war die Halle voller Weed-Rauch
Und ich stieg als Phönix aus meiner eig'nen Asche wieder auf

Danach schreit, dass ich nicht mal um Haaresbreite broke bin
Mit Schirm, Charme und Melone, Hirn, Plan und Methode
Immer wenn ich mal 'nen neuen Zwirn trage, folgt die Mode
Ich fick die ganze Welt, bis mir mal der Schwanz abfällt
Geb dem Kellner 100 Euro, weil er mir den Mantel hält
Auf dem Pantherfell räkeln sie sich jetzt
Meine Mädchen sind Burlesque, für ein Leben wie am Set
Von Harlem Nights, wenn alles doppelt kommt, du beim Reden Kratzen hörst
Merkst du Trottel prompt, dein Telefon wird abgehört
Und seit der Prohibition war für mich klar
Ich brauch nur Munition und Pomade im Haar
Reservoir Dogs, Gangsta Squad, Ehrensache
Wir handeln nach dem Motto: Leben und sterben lassen
Du bist ein Pessimist, seitdem du die Message kriegst
Ich bin auf mei'm Messi-Shit, der beste, den es gibt - Eko Frisch

Wir kommen rein und die Party ist tot
Wir reißen alles auseinander wie arabisches Brot
Die Frage ist: Wo gibt's hier was zu trinken? Ich sag
Ma' die besten Drinks sind bestimmt wieder mal hinten gelagert
Ich mach den Laden leer, ich glaub, die Kellnerin mag mich sehr
Nicht weil ich ein Held bin, der in Geld schwimmt wie Dagobert
Es geht um die Persönlichkeit, jeder will der König sein
Mein Leben war ein Hartreim Projekt - Rödelheim
Jetzt ist mit Angeben Schluss, mit Geld kannst du nichts
Kaufen, wenn du draußen deinen Mann stehen musst
Du stehst nachts auf einer Wiese, dich bedroht irgendeiner
Und danach machst du schön die Fliege wie ein Modedesigner

Jede Zeile lässt es knacken wie gebackene Chips
Und willst du Gold für die Platte mit Hits, doch pass auf

Ah, jetzt sind die Monster erwacht
Wie in London, Compton und Bronx in der Nacht

Ihr seid schädlich, seht, ich red nicht mit euch
Ich bin Scarface-mäßig, ich leg mich ins Zeug
So sieht's mindestens aus, ich bring besten Sound
Halt mich über Wasser, bis ich keine Schwimmweste brauch
Wenn ihr heute behauptet, es sei ein Familiending
Läuft es morgen bei euch Heuchlern auf Inzest hinaus
Kings back in town, Hinsetzen, Clown
Du bist so 'ne Pussy, du kassierst auch Pimp Slaps von Frau'n
Gangster-Saga wie bei Frank Sinatra
Bis der Cheddar fließt wie auf Enchiladas

Bisschen Weißwein und Mr. Nice Guy
Holt die Zigarre aus dem Humidor
Steckt dem Kellner ein paar Hunnis in die Uniform
Champagner für sie und Whisky für mich

Schwer zu fassen, auch wenn sie uns verdächtigen
Ihr werdet daran scheitern wie die Unbestechlichen
Man sollte Jungs wie uns nicht belästigen
Denn wir sind Choleriker, nicht leicht zu besänftigen
Meine Familie ist unantastbar, du Motherfucker
Ich laufe Amok wie am Valentinstag-Massaker
Wenn es sein muss, und kontrollier die Unterwelt
Der Staat wird bestochen, denn so machen wir hier unser Geld
Ihr labert mir zu viel, echte Männer reden nicht
Denk an die Schweigepflicht, Beton-Schuhe steh'n dir nicht
Unser Ehrenkodex: Wir sind Geschäftsmänner
Junge, zahl dein Schutzgeld und du lebst auf dieser Welt länger
Es ist nicht persönlich, alles nur geschäftlich
Ich komm in dein Bezirk und zeig dir, dass du nicht der Chef bist

Du willst ein Kind von mir? Negativ, Blutgruppe
Ihr könnt ein Kilo zieh'n, der Stoff geht heute auf
Mich, denn die Taschen sind dick wie Cee Lo Green

Wir sind Helden, denn sie bauen uns ein Denkmal, what?!
Ich sitz im Benz, sie streckt die Brust aus dem Fenster, bra
Alleine sind wir erfolgreich, doch zusamm'n schlagen wir ein wie die Avengers, boah

Das Morgenrot in der Skyline steht dir
Die Leute warten im Stau
Auf dem Weg zur Arbeit, drehen sie ihr Radio auf
Ich liebe deine Chausseen, die Brücken, den Hafen
Bei dir da draußen, liegt das Glück auf der Straße
Die Croissants, in deinen Restaurants
Bei dir kriegt man jeden Tag aufs Neue eine Chance
Nach wahrer Liebe, sehnen sich die Traumtänzer
Die Tagediebe, stehen vor dem Schaufenster
Große Stadt, wisch dir jetzt den Schlaf aus den Augen
Es warten schon vor'm Rathaus die Tauben
In der Küche stehen
Und es läuft Frühstücksfernsehen bei Müsli und Cornflakes
Wegen dir hab ich es hoch geschafft
Denn du hast mich so gemacht, große Stadt, yeah

Guten Morgen große Stadt
Hast du etwa wieder durchgemacht?
Wir starten in den Tag
Aber du bist schon lange wach
Und bin ich auch mal weg, ich komm zurück zu dir
Jeder hat die selbe Chance, und kann in dir sein Glück probieren

Der Wecker klingelt beim Bäcker schon um 8 nach 4
Und wenn der Morgentau, auf den Blättern liegt
Stören uns die Sorgen kaum, ob's am Wetter liegt?

Jeder neue Tag ist vielversprechend
Schau wie sie Gassi, zur Schule oder joggen gehen
Große Stadt, was hast du heute für uns vorgesehen?
Kann dich von Oben sehen, von einem Wolkenkratzer
Deine Wege sind mit Gold gepflastert
Ich weiß, wenn ich bei 'nem Milchkaffee die Nachrichten schau
Und deine Lichter seh, du hast nicht geschlafen genau
Große Träume, große Ziele und das große Geld
Es ist ein Spiel des Lebens was uns am Boden hält
Du große Stadt, deine Schönheit hast du uns geschenkt
Und deine Möglichkeiten unbegrenzt, guten Morgen

Guten Morgen große Stadt
Hast du etwa wieder durchgemacht?
Wir starten in den Tag
Aber du bist schon lange wach
Und bin ich auch mal weg, ich komm zurück zu dir
Jeder hat die selbe Chance, und kann in dir sein Glück probieren
Große Stadt

Bewaffnet bis auf die Zähne
Hast uns gewappnet für den Tag
Nachts voller Lichter wie Fontänen
So wiegst du uns in den Schlaf
Bis zu den Platten in der Vorstadt
Wecken uns Sirenen auf
Und weil wir alle etwas vor haben
Hörst du nie zu leben auf

Klar das du dich nicht allein auf Schicksal verlässt

Ich bin zurück obwohl ich gar nicht weg war
Ich war meiner zeit voraus mit meinen Rap Parts
Mit den gewissen extras und den gewissen etwas
Zu viele haben sich verkauft mit ihren Drecks parts
Ich war am chilln um auf mein leben klar zu kommen
Einfach chilln mit Massagen in der Abendsonne
Dazu ein paar Caprisonnen
Um einfach wieder gut zu sein
Und dann gemerkt ich kann nicht für jeden Bruder sein
Ich muss frei sein von allen was mir Kraft raubt
Jetzt fühl ich mich free als komme ich aus dem Knast raus
Es war kein Albtraum trotzdem muss man zu sich selber finden
Jetzt weiß ich was ich will ich werde diesen Berg erklimmen

„Ey yo, Eko, seit wann haben denn die Türken W-LAN?“
Seitdem Bülent Ceylan meinen Bülük seh'n kann
Denn Ekrem lässt den Sack häng'n vor der Webcam
Woraufhin Bülent meinte „Respect, man!“
Bis dann Kaya Yanar auf einmal da war
Im scheiß Pyjama, weil er auf Skype nicht klar kam
Wir laufen über'n roten Teppich, die Quotentürken
Die mit Schuhen aber nicht mal in die Wohnung dürfen
Bei manchen guckt man zu, Leute, der kann's
Der Somuncu spricht zum Beispiel besser Deutsch als Herr Lanz
Doch da gibt's auch welche, den' das Sprechen schwer fiel
Zum Beispiel „Der Gerät“ oder Mesut Özil
Du findest uns sogar im Pay-TV
Die Sibel Kekilli ist dort doch stets beliebt
Ich wär' schon Millionär, doch Türken kaufen keine CDs
Sie brauchen Gel, um am Wochenende saufen zu geh'n, was geht?

„Was ist mit Gülcan, dude? Sie ist Türkin, so wie du.“
Als Jugendlicher wollt' ich auch mein Sucuk in ihr Brötchen tun
Heute bin ich dreißig und hab eine german Frau
Und wenn sie schläft, darf ich mal Türkisches im Fernseh'n schau'n
Vielleicht wundert es dich
Und du hältst es für ein' Witz doch warte ab,
Bis der erste von uns Bundeskanzler ist
Denn wenn du einmal nur den Spam öffnest hier
Guckst du Fanpost von mir, von Cem Özdemir
Ich heiße auch die Neuen willkommen im Quotentürken-Club
Sila Sahin oder Sücrü vom Trödeltrupp
Hier ist für jeden Platz, crazy, ey
Mehr Platz als in der Mumu von Lady Ray
Man besetzt uns schon bei Action-Shows
Wie „Alarm für Cobra 11“ mit 1,60 groß
Ich wär' schon Millionär, doch die Türken laden sich den Scheiß
Und wenn sie mich mal treffen, heißt es „Lad mich doch mal ein!“

Eko Fresh,"Ich zeig dir heut wie ein Song geht, von A-Z
Das gilt für harte Raps, oder auch Party Tracks
Falls es dich interessiert, zeig ich dir wie's funktioniert
Scheiß auf iPhone 4, schreib es lieber auf Papier
Mache dir Notizen was du überhaupt zeigen willst
Worüber du schreiben willst, genügend zum Zeilen füllen
Jetzt geht's an die Bars. 16 an der Zahl
Glaub mir, für das erste Mal ist das gängig und normal
Und jetzt zeichne mit dem Stift, an jede zweite Zeile einen Strich
Damit du weißt wo du grad bist
Das erste was dir einfällt, ist meistens die Punchline
Also schreib sie als zweites und halt dir den Platz frei
Denn der Reim den du dir darauf einfallen lässt
Dient dir meistens nur zum Zweck, also schreib ihn doch zuerst
Und das ganze acht mal. Guck dann hast du deinen Part
Und das gleiche noch einmal, Plus 'ne Hook rein und das wars

Ich zeig dir heute wie man ein Lied einrappt
Denn sieh mal, Ek beherrscht diese Disziplin perfekt
Und ich zeig dir wie man Klicks bekommt
Denn wo kriegst du sonst schon du ein paar Tipps umsonst?
Ich zeige dir wie man einen Track macht, Freezy weiß es exakt
Du brauchst nichts außer Beat und einen Textblatt
Nimm dir die Zeit, wie der King zu rhymen
Kein Problem, ich bring's dir bei, Raptutorial 2

Und jetzt suchst du dir'n Beat aus, doch ey man Pass
Lieber auf das er auch zum Thema passt
Nich immer so 'ne Hektik, nimm dir Zeit und check es
Genau, er muss passen zur Stimmung deines Textes
Und denk mal nach über die BpM-Zahl
Sie sollte ausschlaggebend sein für deine Endwahl
Ich zum Beispiel fühl' mich am wohlsten bei 90
Jeder Ton kommt da deutlich und mein Flow überzeugt dich
Manche können ohne Beat nicht schreiben, kein Problem
Für sie gilt im Prinzip das Gleich, einfach drehen
Und bei den Aufnahmen machen viele zwei-drei Spuren
Ich bleib meistens stur bei einer nur, dann bleibt es Pur
Doch wie gesagt, nicht jeder Dude macht's wie ich
Hauptsache es wird später gut abgemischt
Und dann geht's zum Mastering um ihn perfekt zu machen
Voila - Jetzt hast du deinen ersten Track im Kasten. Kid

Ich zeig dir heute wie man ein Lied einrappt

Ich zeige dir wie man einen Track macht, Freezy weiß es exakt
Du brauchst nichts außer Beat und einen Textblatt
Nimm dir die Zeit, wie der King zu rhymen
Kein Problem, ich bring's dir bei, Raptutorial 2

Hab deine eigenen Ideen, byte nicht von irgendwem
Sonst klingst du wie alle, aber keiner will dich sehen
Weiter geht's mit der Visuellen Seite
Such dir jemand Fähiges, der Videos schneidet
Spar dein Geld, gib dich nicht mit wenig zufrieden
Denn an der Qualität soll's nicht liegen
Jungs werden dich feiern und Mädchen sich verlieben
Mach es selbst, dann brauchst du dich für ein Label nicht verbiegen
Renn keinem hinterher und sieh was passiert
Denn wenn du gut bist, mein Freund, wollen sie was von dir
Sei besser vorsichtig mit wem du dich umgibst
Sonst bist du eh man dich vergisst, der der im Leben nix besitzt
Doch zum Thema jetzt zurück, die Premiere deines Clips
Und bevor du dich versiehst sind es zehn Millionen Clicks
Das waren nur paar Ratschläge, jetzt musst du selber Gas geben
Oder soll ich dir noch in den Arsch treten?

Ich bin zwar kein Akademiker
Aber auch nicht grad der grösste Sprach-Legastheniker
Doch solange alle Menschen denken dass ich’s eh bin
Muss ich mir beim reden, keine Mühe geben
What the Fuck? Paperlapap
Dann red ich halt wie ein Kanacke, das macht, alter das klappt
Warum werd ich von allen für ein’ Gangster gehalten
Und bekomm nicht die Möglichkeit mein Image selbst zu gestalten
Warum hab ich aber diesen Stempel erhalten
Oder habe ich mich etwa seltsam verhalten?
Ich frag mich, warum denken Leute das?
Bin ich euch zu krass? Ich hab doch den deutschen Pass
Alta, das sieht doch nicht wie Integration aus
Alle denken sowieso wir stinken nach Knoblauch
Weil sie alle in mir nur den Krümmeltürken sehn
Tu ich euch den Gefallen und erfülle das Klischee

Alta, Alta, tja Pech jetzt ist er wirklich hier
Alta, Alta, ihr wolltet ihn jetzt habt ihr ihn

Liebe Bild, ich bin zwar ein Gymnasiast
Aber Gangster, Rüpel, Proll, Rapper klingt asi, passt
Denn auch wenn ich mich als ein Vorbild zeige
Wenn ich Worte schreibe, habt ihr Vorurteile
Mann ihr wolltet in mir den Türken sehn
Also schön aufdrehen wie ein Hörgerät
Denn für euch bin ich nur, der Alibikanacke
Mit der schwarzen Lederjacke und die Haare sind so kacke
Früher gab ich mir mal Mühe ausversehen
Doch warum überhaupt Benehmen wenn sie’s überhaupt nicht sehn
Ihr wollt einen Osman? Ihr kriegt einen Osman
Ich bin der Boss man, ab geht die Post lan
Denkst du dass das Türkenpack, gar nichts in der Birne hat?
Dann hast du irgendwas, hinter deiner Stirn verpasst
Wenn ihr denkt ich bin asozial, hab ich gar keine Wahl

Ich weiß wie das ist, wenn du arm bist
Man sieht es schon allein dran, wie dünn dein Arm ist
Ihr habt nichts zu beißen und man sieht deine Rippen
Beim Schulsport lässt du dich deshalb nie gerne blicken
Deine Freunde haben Markenklamotten
Doch du nicht, du trägst von deinem Vater die Socken
Du kennst das nicht, du warst noch nie shoppen
Deshalb fragst du Gott „Bitte, wann wird das stoppen?“
Die anderen lachen, weil du noch kein Handy hast
Du tust als würde's dich nicht jucken
Vielleicht kennst du das
du ziehst Servietten beim Mäckes ab
Denn die Woche habt ihr kein Klopapier mehr, das Geld ist knapp
Und gehen die ganzen anderen mal auf Klassenfahrt
Dann warst du grad nicht da, oder hast abgesagt
Keine Patte da, doch hör mal mein Sohn
Wenn ich das schaffe, schaffst du das auch

Es wird schon alles gut gehen
denn alles was möglich ist
Kann auch geschehen
einfach Augen zu und weitergehen
All diese Stufen
sind nicht nur schön anzusehen
Nein, auf all diesen Stufen
wirst du ganz nach oben gehen

Ich weiß wie das ist, wenn du nicht grad der Schönste bist
Auf dem Pausenhof beachten dich die Mädchen nicht
Klar stört es dich, doch was willst du machen
Wenn sie anfangen wegen deines Aussehens über dich zu lachen
Ist deine Nase zu lang, oder bist du zu dick
Kommst aus 'nem anderen Land, was für ein Missgeschick
Denn spricht sie dich dann doch mal an
Fängst du einfach nur zu stottern an
Kleiner Homie, du bist noch kein Mann
doch möchtest einer werden
Keine Sorge, denn du wirst noch viel auf deiner Reise lernen
Greif nach den Sternen
komm den Wichsern doch zuvor
Ladies stehen auf Charisma und Humor
Sei du selbst, lach und sei nicht immer wütend
Denk daran, die Gesellschaft brauch Gewinnertypen
Dann findest du auch deine Süße, mal irgendwo
Wenn ich das kann, kannst du das auch

Es wird schon alles gut gehen
denn alles was möglich ist
Kann auch geschehen
einfach Augen zu und weitergehen
All diese Stufen
sind nicht nur schön anzusehen
Nein, auf all diesen Stufen

Keiner an dich glaubt, deine Zukunft ist ungewiss
Du fängst an zu hassen, das Leben ist nicht cool
Verfluchst die ganzen Ratten, denn sie sägen an dei'm Stuhl
Erfolglos und du hast auch so'n Gefühl
Als hättest du die Karriere grad ins Klo gespühlt
Keiner ruft dich an
Sie drehen dir den Rücken zu
Dabei hat doch keiner hier, dafür so geschwitzt wie du
Du fragst warum, ich hab doch nur mein Glück versucht
Doch ich weiß, mein Bruderherz, du kommst noch zurück im nu
Hör mir zu, wenn du nur die Ohren spitzt
Kann es sein, das du bald wieder ganz oben bist
Der Scheiß ist nie zu spät, bleibe niemals stehen
Hör nicht auf andere und glaub an deine eigenen Ideen
Guck wie einfach es doch geht
es ist wirklich so
Wenn ich das packe, packst du das auch

Es wird schon alles gut gehen
denn alles was möglich ist
Kann auch geschehen
einfach Augen zu und weitergehen
All diese Stufen
sind nicht nur schön anzusehen
Nein, auf all diesen Stufen
wirst du ganz nach oben gehen

Sie sagen, glaub nur an dich selbst
Dann geht alles von ganz allein (ganz allein yeah)
Ich sage, glaub an deine Schritte
Denn jeder Schritt, in jede Richtung
Könnte der richtige sein

Es war 2004 als ich davon gehört hatte
Nagelbomben-Anschlag in der Keupstraße
Man, ich schwör, es hatte mich verdammt gestört
Eine Bombe ist geplatzt vor meinem Stammfriseur?
Vor meinen Landsleuten? Das tat mir sehr weh
Sowas kennt man eigentlich nur aus dem Fernsehen
Also fahr ich hin, die ganze Straße war dahin
Dabei handelt's sich um eines unserer Wahrzeichen
Ich dachte sowas passiert nicht bei uns
Nicht mal in Köln, die armen Leute man
Das hätte auch ich sein können
Und dann gingen die Gerüchte los
Wirklich unfassbar, angeblich war's die türkische Mafia
Eine Woche später als sie glaubten es waren Kurden
Ihr seht viele Theorien, die durch den Raum geworfen wurden
Dann hieß es, der Friseur sei in die Scheiße verwickelt
Er wäre kriminell und die Polizei, sie ermittelt
Dass man ihn plus Familie wie Verbreche verhörte
War dann vorerst das letzte, was man hörte
Ein Benefizkonzert, E-K-O trat da auf
Und in Cologne nahm dann alles ein gewohnten Lauf

Und es brennt in unseren Herzen
Schweigen ist wie Schmerzen
Und die hören niemals auf
Schrei es ganz laut raus
Lass dir nix erzählen
Worte können quälen
Stell dich diesem Leben
Wir werden alles geben

Heute wissen wir alle, wer's gewesen ist
Was denen, die drunter litten leider aber wenig hilft
Wir wissen, es hätt auch verhindert werden können
Ich dachte, so was passiert überall, doch nicht bei uns in Köln
Weißt du, wie es ist, du denkst, du bist bei uns zu Hause hier
Und wegen deinem Aussehen will dich jemand aussortieren
Kann nicht beschreiben, wie krass ich enttäuscht war
Ich wusste nix davon, ich dachte, ich wär Deutscher
Weißt du wie es ist? Dich lässt der Rechtsstaat im Stich
Du hast knapp überlebt und sie verdächtigen dich
Zehn Menschen tot als die Behörde scheinbar schlief
Irgendwie fies, dass man danch was von Dönermorden liest
Habt ihr mal dran gedacht, wie die Familien sich gefühlt haben
Als ihre Väter so früh starben?
Sie wollten Aufklärung, warteten geduldig ab
Es gab niemanden, der sich dafür entschuldigt hat
Diesen Menschen eine Stimme geben ist der Grund
Genau deshalb bring ich dieses Thema auf den Punkt
Es ist doch wunderbar, dass hier so viele Völker wohnen
Dat hier ist für die Keup, mee kölsche Straß

Und es brennt in unseren Herzen
Schweigen ist wie Schmerzen
Und die hören niemals auf
Schrei es ganz laut raus
Lass dir nix erzählen
Worte können quälen
Stell dich diesem Leben
Wir werden alles geben

Und es brennt, und es brennt
Und es brennt, und es brennt
Schrei es ganz laut raus

Und es brennt in unseren Herzen (und es brennt, und es brennt, und es brennt)
Schweigen ist wie Schmerzen (und es brennt, und es brennt)
Und die hören niemals auf
Schrei es ganz laut raus
Lass dir nix erzählen

Ich bin so unsportlich, ich kenn' das Wort ""Sport"" nicht

Ich verschwende keine Zeile, denn ich kenne keine Eile
And're rennen eine Meile, ich penne eine Weile
Denn ich hasse Sport, ha-ha-hasse Sport
Doch ich hustle hier, und ich hustle dort
Es ist 6 nach 2, ich hab Ketchup bei
das ist Fettsackstyle, Mic-Check, eins, drei!
Denn ich hasse Sport, ha-ha-hasse Sport
Und Doktor Zorn pumpt den Bass ins Ohr

Ich mach' kein Bodybuilding, denn ich wurd' im Hort nie gehänselt
Beim Sportschwänzen übte ich das Worteverwenden
Ich hatte niemals vor, Langstreckenrekorde zu brechen
Mein Ding war eher in 'nem Planschbecken Stück Torte zu essen
Denn am Mic, denn am Mic
Ist dort, wo ihr euch drücken wollt
Drücken wollt, auch mit Hüftgold ist mir das Glück Hold
Ich hoffe, dass ihr E-K-O und Deluxe folgt
Im sozialen Netzwerk der globalen Fettsäcke
Du nimmst Anabol, doch wir sind dir lyrisch überlegen
Für dein' Standard-Flow musstest du schon übelst überlegen
Es ist anstrengend genug, sich auf der Bühne zu bewegen
Du hebst mit paar Typen Hanteln, ich brauch Typen, die mich heben
Ihr macht Clips beim Hantelnstemmen?
Wir die Hits, ohne uns anzustreng', Ek und Sam Deluxe",Fettsackstyle,2014

Ein paar Leihwagen folgten
jetzt ist scheinbar schon Gold drin
Das Leben ist nur eine Kippe lang
Ich trete die Nutte mit Füßen
Und die Hater, die mucken, ihr Süßen
Müsst diese eklige Truppe begrüßen GD
in der Schule schon vom Teacher gehasst
Heut' bedient mich der Spast in 'nem Riesenpalast
Ich bring' ein muttergeficktes Drecksalbum
Was alle die kommen in Schatten stellt
Wenn ich rapp', tun sich die Wolken auf und ? Nackenschellen
Früher hab' ich Tracks in mein Forum getan
Konnte nicht mal meine Wohnung bezahlen, heute kack' ich Geld
Hörte Pac schon, als er gelebt hat, Thug Life
Deutscher Kanackenrap basiert auf meinem Sackschweiß
Ihr fickt nicht mal, wenn ich tot bin meine Bars
Steckt euch die gottverdammte Krone in den Arsch, Punchline
Jetzt ist der missgebürtige Bastard Freezy bereit
Und ich piss in dein Viertel am Rastplatz, GD 4 Life

Damals fragte ich mich, wo werd' ich in der Zukunft sein
Heute seid ihr alle unter mir wie YouTube-Likes
Heute sind unsere Konzerte voller feuchter Frauen
Von Hartz IV zum Millionär, der deutsche Traum
Damals hielten Lehrer mich für einen hoffnungslosen Fall
Heute könnt ich ihre Tochter nur in Jogginghose knallen
Jetzt wird richtig gefickt wie im Freudenhaus
Aus'm Ghetto in die Charts der deutsche Traum

Das ist der langersehnte Sound, den ihr Schlampensöhne braucht
Als hätt' ich meinen Cock in einen Topf voll Mandelöl getaucht
Summer, ich wurd' bekannt durch meine offensiven Tracks
Das Leben ist 'ne Bitch, ich hab' die Fotze nie geleckt
Es ist der Copperfield des Raps
Denn als ich diese Szene schon am ficken war
habt ihr noch otuz bir gecheckt, Korrekt
alle reden sie von uns in großen Tönen
Doch langsam habe ich die Nase voll wie Jogi Löw
Sie wollen mitverdienen, denn es ist die Hitmaschine Cem
Der eure Mütter fickt, während ihr in Wichskabinen hängt
Fick die Fit4Fun-Diät, ich muss vor keiner Hantel stehen
Ich schnipse einmal mit den Fingern, deine Schlampe bläst
Ich steh' über euch, das Wetter hier ist angenehm
Packe meinen ? aus und piss auf das gesamte Game
Ek, Farid und Summer, die Stimmen aus dem Hinterhof

Gangsterrapper, Menschenhändler, es werden Blutlachen erwartet
Deine Crewmember sind Arme, die in U-Bahn-Gängen schlafen
Hurensöhne sagen, ich sei nicht der beste
Und das ist der Grund, wieso ich sie per Drive-by zerfetze
Fick die Bonzen und dein' VIP-Bereich
Ich bin dein Stiefvater und deiner Schwesters Liebhaber zugleich
Zu deinem Feature sag ich „Nein!“, ticke Pulver in der Disco
Denn mein Kontostand sieht aus wie die Nummer unter'm Strichcode
Deine Mutter muss mein' Dick blowen, sie macht Scheine auf'm Kiez
Ich glaub, die meisten Rapper leiden an 'ner Seifenallergie
Fick das Ordnungsamt
Wenn 'ne Frau mir einen Orgasmus vorspielt (Ja was macht sie dann?)
Macht sie mir einen Porno an (Ah!)
Ich hör Hurensöhne mucken
böse gucken, große Töne spucken
Doch ich ficke eure Mütter

Das ist der Grund, warum ich keinem meine Hand reiche
Egal, was ich erreiche, ich bleibe wie ich bin
Mann, ich kam in diese Branche als ein kleines Kind
Seit 13 langen Jahren bin ich jetzt schon angesagt
Doch rede lieber mit der Klofrau, als mit ander'n Stars
Ein Mann der Tat, das Gheddo hat mich so gemacht
Die Street, die mich liebt, hat diesen Eko auf den Thron gebracht
Represent Cologne, du Spast, Kölle, was geht? Sie sagen Eko
Du hast echt die Hölle durchlebt
Doch dann ist es gut am Ende für dich ausgegangen!
Ich sag, ich war nie unten, das Gheddo hat mich aufgefangen
Also tausend Dank an meine echten Fans
Sie standen zu mir und pissten auf die schlechten Bands
Damals sprang mein Opa auf 'nen dreckigen Lastwagen
Schaut uns heute an, wir sind Kanaks, die was haben

Ganz egal, wie reich ich bin
Das Gheddo bleibt in mir drin
Denn das ist, was mich ausmacht
Nrw bis zur Hauptstadt, yeah
Ganz egal, wie weit ich komm'
Ich bleib auf Beton
Denn es lebt die Legende
Also hebt eure Hände, yeah

Aufgewachsen zwischen Dreck und Beton
Ja, auch ich bin aus'm Ghetto gekomm'
Ein Leben auf der schiefen Bahn, abseits von der Norm
Trotzdem hat diese Zeit mich geformt
Und ich schreite nach vorn, immer weiter nach Norden
Dieser Sido von gestern ist heute leider gestorben
Er hätte mir mit seiner Art mein Leben beinah verdorben
Aber nein, ich mache weiter bis morgen, mach' dir keine Sorgen
Heute bin ich weit weg von der Scheiße
Heute seht ihr mich von meiner besseren Seite
Ich sag's, wie es ist, meine Rettung war Spaiche
Und jetzt hoffe ich für Eko das Gleiche, weißte?
Aber ganz egal, wie weit wir sind
Das Gheddo bleibt hier drin
Auch wenn ich jetzt ein Haus hab

Das geht von Köln Porz bis hin ins MV
Aus'm Gheddo raus, heute Business im Penthouse
Du lebst im Block, das macht dich nicht als Mensch aus
Weil du für die Scheiße nur ein bisschen Talent brauchst
Doch es fühlt sich gut an, wenn du dir 'n Benz kaufst
Für die Brüder und Cousins auch, vergiss die nicht
Weil du dick im Geschäft bist und jetzt nicht mehr so viel Stress ist
Denkst du, du bist etwas Besseres, doch das bist du nicht
Aus'm Ghetto ins Kino, Eko und Sido
Heute mach ich Cash, lecko mio, guck mal an ich hatte nix
Doch vergesse niemals, wer ich bin
Denn ich hab das Gheddo in mei'm Herzen drin, yeah
Mein Bett damals im Block war Altpapier
Heute guck ich auf die Top Gun, halb vor vier
Heute merk ich, ich hab vergeblich auf Rettung gehofft
Denn du kriegst den Jungen aus'm Block, doch er bleibt Ghetto im Kopf, yeah

Ganz egal, wie reich ich bin

Ich war noch ziemlich jung in meiner Partyzeit
Mann, ich trieb es bunt und zog mir Nasen rein
Einmal ging ich klar zu weit, denn wenn du so ein dünner Junge bist
Bist du einfach umgekippt, Lungenriss
Ich war im Krankenhaus
Ich dachte, scheiße bald kannst du raus
Aber es wird nie wieder ein Blunt geraucht
Wie soll ich kiffen mit 'nem Loch in der Brust
Aber eine kleine Sache war mir noch nicht bewusst
Man kann auch backen, Backe Backe Kuchen
Shit, Mann, ich muss diese Kacke mal versuchen
Ich hab die Faxen dicke also hauten wir 11 Gramm Hasch in die Muffinmische
Und wir hatten frische ein' gegessen, nichts passiert
Drei gegessen, nichts passiert
Ich glaub, ich muss sie alle essen, dass der Shit mal wirkt
Und auf einmal kommt der Gong,  als hätt' ich nach 'ner holländischen Bong
Zu viel Sonne abbekommen, fuck you

Du
Kannst du das hören?
Ja hörst du mich?
Ich glaub, ich hör mein Herz, Alter

Haschbutter in die heiße Pfanne, wir backen feine Muffins
17 Gramm für 16 Stückchen müssten erst einmal langen
Schließlich hab ich solche Sachen vorher nie getestet
Also erst mal eins genommen und das vorsichtig gefressen
Ach was soll der Geiz ich habe schon seit heute morgen nichts gegessen
Warte noch über 'ne Stunde und versorge mich mit den nächsten
Scheint hier einfach nicht zu wirken, denk, okay dann friss dich satt
Bestimmt Rezeptes, er ist kurz vor Mitternacht
Ich bin das sechste grad am kauen
Der Magen verdaut die Muffins im Bauch
Denn erst wenn du nicht mehr daran glaubst, beginnt der Rausch
Und der Scheiß hört nicht mehr auf, du willst hier raus
Doch erst dann geht's auf den Horrortrip
Die dunkle Vergangenheit spielt sich in meinem Kopf ab wie ein schlechter Film
Und ohne Zusammenhang springen die Gedanken vom einem zum nächsten Bild
Ich komme damit grade überhaupt nicht klar
Weil ich wirklich voll im Arsch bin, Herz am pochen und rasen
Kotze zwei Liter vom Balkon in den Garten, buah

Hab ich grade gelacht?
Alter hört auf zu lachen, okay?
Ich will, dass die Scheiße sofort aufhört, Alter
Kann mich vielleicht irgendjemand von euch umbringen?

Denn mit mir war nix mehr anzufang'
Sie kam, ihr Telefon wählt 112
Doch weil es um Drogen geht, war die Polizei gleich bei
Sie brachten mich weg, ich dachte, ich verreck'
Bin so stoned, Infusion, gute Nacht, Mister Ek
Und ich wachte vercheckt auf, verfluchte die Drogen
Unterwegs ungelogen meine Schuhe verloren
Habe mich im wahrsten Sinne auf die Socken gemacht
War noch vertrottelt und etwas geschockt von der Nacht
Ich konnt' mir in den Arsch beißen, denn an diesem Zeitpunkt
Stand die Story als Schlagzeile in der Zeitung
Was für 'ne Blamage, meine Bastardenvisage
Kam dann auch im Fernsehen und jeder lachte auf der Straße
Ich wünsche niemand, dass er so 'ne boruz kriegt
Noch ein Tipp, macht das niemals nach, Horrortrip

Das machen wir aber nie wieder, ne?
Och, wenn wir wieder nüchtern sind
Oder ne, doch nicht!
Eigentlich war's schon geil
Ne ne ne, doch komm, wir machen nochmal
Ne, lass mal sein, doch

Eko Fresh,"Schönen guten Abend
Ich erzähl euch mal wat
Und zwar, Rapper sind nur leichte Beute
Ihr wisst nicht, was der Scheiß mir bedeutet, let's go

Kleiner, in der Cypher bin ich Meister in dem Job wie Yoda
Ihr wärt gern In Da House wie ein Obdachloser
Meine achte Langspielplatte
Ich hab' mehr Hunger als es einst Mahatma Gandhi hatte
Keine Macht der Stannikacke
Und weil ich Reime hab und Money mache
Beginnt der Ek jetzt aufzuräumen
Talent wächst nicht auf den Bäumen
Keine Mätzchen mehr mein Freund
Du kannst nur Scheiß reden für Brotkrümel
Dein Gesicht ist wie ein Turnschuh, reintreten und wohlfühlen
Ich bin fresh und meine Reime sind auch nicht grad ohne
Sie sind schwer zu finden so wie Diamonds in Sierra Leone
Schreibe wie aus der Pistole, greif mir nen Haufen von Kohle
Und weiß genau, dieser Scheiß bringt dich drauf wie auf Droge
Nein, vielleicht brauchst du 'ne Probe, zeig dir die laute Methode
Und du hast gleich einen Steifen vom Sound in der Hose
Peinliche Clowns sind in Mode, keiner mehr braucht Rumgepose
Denn wenn ich rapp, sind die Schweine jetzt mit Strophe
Du wirst weder mich, noch sonst keinen nerven
Weißt du was, ich sollte dein Songschreiber werden
Und wenn die Sonne einmal scheint wie heute
Kannst du mich ansprechen, doch bleibst leichte Beute

Rapper sind nur leichte Beute
Ich reflektier', was hab ich erreicht bis heute
Egal was war, ich gab mich nicht zufrieden
Doch es sind die Straßen, die mich lieben, ich hab' nie danach gefragt

Rapper sind nur leichte Beute
Glaubt nicht, dass ich irgendeinen Scheiß bereute
Ich brauchte nie den Harten hier zu schieben
Denn es sind die Straßen, die mich lieben, ich hab' nie danach gefragt

Bra du siehst Interaktionen, gelenkt von meinen
Sindan Psychosen, Zinker und Huren
Sind alles was ich seh hier im Knast und
Du laberst mich zu von dein Entlassung
Hör zu du doof, mich juckt nicht, was du drippelst
Wie du zizis machst dass die Kassen dann klingeln
Ich mach mir nur Sorgen um eine Sache bra
Der Bose-Blaster, den mein Cousin mir gelassen hat pff
Leute wollen rauben wie Xatar
Doch tragen Sturmhauben wie Amcas
Lass mal, ich bin auf anderen Filmen
Leb das, was die anderen filmen
Mit Redcams geliehen im Benz und MAC-10s
Ich schäme mich fremd
Doch nicht für den Bluff der du heute bist
Nein für den Blick der zeigt dass du Beute bist, ah

Rapper sind nur leichte Beute
Ich reflektier', was hab ich erreicht bis heute
Egal was war, ich gab mich nicht zufrieden
Doch es sind die Straßen, die mich lieben, ich hab' nie danach gefragt

Rapper sind nur leichte Beute
Glaubt nicht, dass ich irgendeinen Scheiß bereute
Ich brauchte nie den Harten hier zu schieben
Denn es sind die Straßen, die mich lieben, ich hab' nie danach gefragt

Eyo ihr checkt meinen Verse und denkt, Ek ist pervers
Leichte Beute, denn ihr rappt ohne Herz, yeah
Ein 16er ist einmal ein ganzes Leben
Hab mein Herz bei der Musik, nicht beim Hanteltraining
Höre Xatar, chill ich auf der Autobahn
Und gib Gummi wie Billy Boy beim Automat
Au ja früher passt ich gut in die Bravo
Heute ruled dieser Chabo wie mein Bruder Sizarro
Ich bin ein Mordskerl wie Dudes aus Chicago
Ekrem bra ich mach Flus aminako
Würdst dir gern den Apple auf der Werbetafel leisten
Doch deshalb musst du nicht in den Pferdeapfel beißen
Drauf geschissen ich schaffte diesen Shit ohne Abi
Und ihr seid aufgeschmissen wie ich ohne Navi
Und jetzt wollt ihr mit mir ficken weil ich reich bin leute
Wo warst du Otto früher, leichte Beute

Ich hatt' gar nichts ohne Scheiß und mein Kühlschrank der war leer
Sogar das einer Kirchenmaus wäre noch ein Luxusleben
Im Grunde gegen das von uns gewesen
Butkus hat mir Leid getan wir hatten nicht mal Hundefutter
Machten uns dann einen Plan und ließen uns nicht unterbuttern
Es gibt ein Gericht das aßen wir stolz
Frisch auf den Tisch und der Magen war voll
Nudeln mit Joghurt die günstigste Mahlzeit der Welt
Ja denn für was vernünftiges war grad kein Geld da
So teilten wir früher wie leibliche Brüder
Reich mir mal rüber, meist blieb nichts über
Wir waren satt ganz kurz, Butkus hat gefurzt
Leitungswasser mit Zitronentee, wir hatten Durst
Aber mach dir nichts draus, das war 'ne Zeit für sich
Was ich hab, hast du auch, unser Leibgericht

Nudeln mit Joghurt für mich und den Hund
Es war nicht grad gesund, als wir nichts hatten, Punkt
Nudeln mit Joghurt, doch es hat uns geschmeckt
Es war absolut lecker für Butkus und Ek
Nudeln mit Joghurt jeden fucking Tag
Unser Leben war zwar hart
Doch was fehlte uns denn grad eigentlich nichts
Denn wir haben uns geliebt
My Fro My Hund in me, oh oui

Butkus ist mein Seelenpartner
Es blieb uns zur ein Zimmer
Doch als mich jeder am haten war, Mann, liebte er mich immer noch
Als ich das Leitungswasser heiß gemacht
Freute er sich gleich unfassbar
Sein Papa sagte, es gibt gleich happa
Als ich den Gazi-Joghurt dann noch quasi vorhol
Gingen beim ihm gleich die Glocken an, Quasimodo
Wir waren so arm, das ist eigentlich verboten
Unser Urlaub war das Durchblättern von Reisekatalogen
Unser Internet war der Videotext
Doch Butkus blieb zu mir korrekt, das ist, was ich an ihm so schätz
Und wenn er dein Gesicht wieder leckt
Dann riechst du noch 'ne Stunde danach
Denn leider riecht sein Mund wie sein Arsch
Ich hab ihn trotzdem lieb, wir sind ziemlich beste Freunde
Und haben an den gleichen Lieblingsessen Freude
Manche denken, dass sie Schoßhunde sind
Doch du bist groß und du stinkst, glaub ich bin doof oder blind
Ich lieb dich so wie ein Kind

Nudeln mit Joghurt für mich und den Hund
Es war nicht grad gesund, als wir nichts hatten, Punkt
Nudeln mit Joghurt, doch es hat uns geschmeckt
Es war absolut lecker für Butkus und Ek
Nudeln mit Joghurt jeden fucking Tag
Unser Leben war zwar hart
Doch was fehlte uns denn grad eigentlich nichts
Denn wir haben uns geliebt
My Fro My Hund in me, oh oui

Wir waren so arm, arm ist gar kein Ausdruck
Die anderen Hunde lachten, aber jetzt bist du der man
Denn wenn ich heute, heute mit dir raus muss
Guckst du arrogant und die Hunde denken „Damn!“
Wir haben gehustled zu zweit, jetzt sind wir Buddys For Life
Hätten uns Nudeln mit Joghurt aus dem Napf geteilt
Denn was gut genug für dich ist, ist gut genug für mich
Dein Leckerli, echt verdient, guten Hunger, denn es geht

Nudeln mit Joghurt für mich und den Hund
Es war nicht grad gesund, als wir nichts hatten, Punkt

Bist du klar im Vorteil, denn ich kam noch keinmal dazu

Es wird Zeit für den realen Hip Hop

Es wird Zeit für den realen Hip Hop

Eyo, die Nutte kommt jetzt
Wer mich hatet, hat ein' kleinen Penis oder Mutterkomplex
Amina, jetzt ist die Mami da
Zieh' die Line von meinem Bein auf dem Laminat
Mieseste Bitch, wer ist realer als ich
Gib's zu, du willst die Vagina ins Gesicht, ah
Rapper kommen Blasen für ein Feature
Aber ich mach gar nix ohne Jiva, niemals
Harte Gangsters schreiben mir Brief
Doch kriegen 'nen Korb wie Miami Heat
Deutschrap ist Jungfrau, ich hab den Dildo für euch
Auf einmal seid ihr Milchbubis feucht
Ich bring den Poledance zum Splash, ohne Ende Cash
Heute mit mei'm Bro Eko Fresh
Und es heben alle die Arme hoch, mein sexy Arsch in der Juice
Guck, ich baller' die Nase Koks vor'm 16bars-Interview, Kurwa

Eko Fresh,"Was ist passiert? Ein Vogel hat's mir zugezwitschert
Das ist die Geschichte von 'nem gewissen U-Bahn Ficker
Afterparty, jeder andere wär' eingeschlafen
U-Bahn Ficker, wo bist du da nur rein geraten?
Die Geilheit übernimmt, er fängt an, zu fummeln
Immer wenn er im Tunnel ist, muss er jemand tunneln
Mittelfinger an die Haters, Mann, kümmert euch um euer'n Shit
Wenn man in der U-Bahn einmal unbekümmert Bräute fickt
Dein Beweggrund, wöchentlich Ärger mit der Misses
Und deshalb die Erregung öffentlichen Ärgernisses
Du hast es nicht geschafft, auf's stille Örtchen zu komm'
Und hast U-Bahn-Verkehr etwas zu wörtlich genomm'
Ich geb dir mal 'n Tipp, 'ne ganz einfache Methode
Zuhaus kannst du ihn rausholen, draußen bleibt er in der Hose
Vielleicht verzeiht dir deine Frau, kauf ihr doch 'nen Blumenstrauß
Und wenn nicht, dann lässt sie dich an der U-Bahn raus

Er kann nicht anders
Es tut ihm so leid
Es ist einfach nur zu geil
In der U-Bahn, zu zweit
Denn er muss ihn rausholen
Er kann sonst nicht mehr
Ja, er macht ihn einfach krank
Dieser U-Bahn-Verkehr
Ja, der U-u-u-u-Bahn, U-u-u-u-Bahn
U-u-u-u-Bahn, U, der U-Bahn-Verkehr
U-u-u-u-Bahn, U-u-u-u-Bahn
U-u-u-u-Bahn, U, der U-Bahn-Verkehr

Morgens wacht sie auf
Macht sich aus dem Haus
Sie trinkt noch ihren Kaffee, und dann raus (weit raus)
Sie wollte Brötchen holen, Moment mal, Schock
Alter, diesen Dödel kennst du doch (ja ja)
Denn sie hatte aus der Zeitung erfahren
Ihr Freund penetriert einfach andere Damen in der scheiß Bahn (was)
Früher war er mal ihr Action-Held
Jetzt wurde sein Ficker-Video noch ins Netz gestellt
Sie wusste nicht, dass ihm so ein Sex gefällt
U-Bahn-Verkehr, was 'ne dreckige Welt
Wie soll sie jetzt die Bilder aus dem Kopf bekomm'
Und die U-Bahn nehmen, um zu ihrem Job zu komm'? (Wie soll das gehen?)
Sie packt ihr Handy aus und guckt bei Twitter
Und sucht nach, Hashtag U-BahnFicker
Und die Moral, fick nicht einfach in der Gegend rum
Hol dir bei BVG und Freundin erst mal 'ne Genehmigung

Er kann nicht anders
Es tut ihm so leid
Es ist einfach nur zu geil
In der U-Bahn, zu zweit
Denn er muss ihn rausholen
Er kann sonst nicht mehr
Ja, er macht ihn einfach krank
Dieser U-Bahn-Verkehr (come on)
Ja, der U-u-u-u-Bahn, U-u-u-u-Bahn
U-u-u-u-Bahn, U, der U-Bahn-Verkehr
U-u-u-u-Bahn, U-u-u-u-Bahn
U-u-u-u-Bahn, U, der U-Bahn-Verkehr

Äh Hallo, ich bin's! Tut mir wirklich leid Schatz
Ich weiß auch nicht richtig, wie das passieren konnte
Ich bin da irgendwie in so 'ne kleine Bummserei geraten.
Aber ey, ich hab dir 'nen Strauß Blumen geholt
Und würd' dich auch gern zum Essen einladen und so.
Und ich bin jetzt auch mehr oder weniger Umberto-Preisträger!
Und du wärst dann quasi die Umberto-Preisträger-Freundinn
Und Blumenstrauß-Besitzerin
Eigentlich 'ne win-win Situation oder?
Und das kann ja unsre Liebe nur stärken.
Wir müssen jetzt zusammenhalte, sowas haut uns nicht vom Hocker oder?
Ey komm schon, verzeih' mir!",U-Bahn Ficker [Circus Halligalli Special],2014
Eko Fresh,"Wenn ich auf die Bühne komm', Halle oder Jugendclub
Ist es ein kleiner Schritt für mich, ein großer für das Publikum
Weil meine Präsenz alleine schon glänzt
Ich bring' die Reimexzellenz, dann schreien die Fans
Scheiß auf den Trend, HipHop ist immer gut, fickt euch ihr Kindercrews
Man kriegt von eurem Shit doch nur blinde Wut
Ob charttechnisch relevant, ist egal
Ich bin einer dieser Rapper, der auch tatsächlich rappen kann
Ja, ich bin der beste, Mann, lebe von meinem Ruf und
Das gilt für Vergangenheit, Gegenwart und Zukunft
Seit Stunden oder Wochen, seit hunderten Epochen
Ek Fresh, best Rap, deine Mutter kann nicht kochen
Bin irgendwann der erste deutsche Rapper in der Vogue
Mcs können nicht mal ficken mit mei'm Backup-Katalog
Sie sind lediglich schlechter, ich hab mich stetig gebessert

Und Izy haut in die Tasten
Alles was ich rappe, sind automatisch Fakten

Du denkst, ich krieg' den Scheiß nicht hin, weil ich 30 bin

Nein, ich brauch' nicht zu üben, ich hab' das einfach drauf
Verbring mehr Zeit auf der Bühne als in meinem Haus
Weil ich immer wieder rappen will ob Disco oder Festival
Bis sogar mein DJ sagt ich habe nichts mehr Eko chill
Kleine Kinder können den Vers nicht verstehen
Ich bin der beste Reimefinder im Sternensystem
Lerne von wem, niemand, sie lernen von mir
Meine Bars zu toppen könnt ihr ja mal gerne probieren
Ich schreib was ich erlebe ihr nur was ihr erleben wollt
Da schweigt die ganze Szene, wenn mein Tourbus durch die Gegend rollt
Nein, Motherfucker das sind keine Metaphern
Reime die Part bleib unfassbar hol den Leichenbestatter
Diss dich nur zur Begrüßung mann da reicht auch kein Pflaster

Eko Fresh,"Mama, wo komm ich her, warum seh' ich anders aus
Sind es die schwarzen Haare oder die braune Haut
Ich bin noch klein, ich will doch nur dazugehören
Es gibt so viele Sachen, die mich an der Schule stören
In der Pause bleiben nur die selben unter sich
Warum mache ich nicht mit beim Reli-Unterricht
Ich schäme mich, warum muss ich denn beim Elternabend
Euch immer übersetzen, was die Lehrer sagen
Sie ärgern mich, ich will doch wie die anderen sein
Sie sagen, ich wär' nur ein Kümmel aus dem Asylantenheim
Mama, weißt du was, unsere Kultur, sie stinkt
Ich muss dir sagen, dass die Deutschen ja viel cooler sind
Die haben viel mehr Geld und es ist auch sauberer bei denen
Kann mich überhaupt einer verstehen
Ich bin erst 10, doch die Last wiegt eine Tonne schwer
Also sag mir, Mama, wo komm ich her

Ich bin hier aufgewachsen, ich bin ein Teil von euch
Kannst du mir mal sagen, warum sich hier keiner freut
Ich bin doch halb deutsch, warum fällt's mir trotzdem schwer
Also Mama, sag mir, wo komm ich her
Ich versteh das nicht, ich bin doch so wie ihr
Denn ich lebe, lache, weine und wohne hier
Ich versuche nachzudenken, doch mein Kopf ist leer
Denn ich frag mich, frag mich, wo komm ich her

Und jetzt bin ich in der Pubertät
Wo komm ich her, ich passe
Ich weiß nur, ich bin jetzt der stärkste in der Klasse
Ich gehe klauen und Sterne vom Mercedes fummeln
Zuhause auf Praline erst mal bisschen Penis rubbeln
Will nicht wie ihr sein, leckt mich am Arsch
Im Gegensatz zu euch trag' ich jetzt schon 'nen Bart, Mama
Ich bin jetzt Ausländer und grenz' mich von euch ab
Seid froh, dass ihr so 'nen Hengst wie mich in Deutschland habt
Ich trag den Kantenschnitt, ich hab' den Kopf rasiert
Und die, die ich beneidet hab, werden gemobbt von mir
Ich will den harten machen und trag jetzt Markensachen
Ihr sollt euch überlegen, über mich noch mal zu lachen
Hausaufgaben mach ich nicht, es reicht, sie abzuschreiben
Es war voll cool, eine Nacht im Knast zu bleiben
Mama, siehst du, ich sag überall, wie toll ich wär
Doch weiß es noch immer nicht, wo komm ich her

Ich bin hier aufgewachsen, ich bin ein Teil von euch
Kannst du mir mal sagen, warum sich hier keiner freut
Ich bin doch halb deutsch, warum fällt's mir trotzdem schwer
Also Mama, sag mir, wo komm ich her
Ich versteh das nicht, ich bin doch so wie ihr
Denn ich lebe, lache, weine und wohne hier
Ich versuche nachzudenken, doch mein Kopf ist leer
Denn ich frag mich, frag mich, wo komm ich her

Heute weiß ich, wo ich herkomm'
Deutschtürke, einer von Millionen
Deutschland, meine Heimat, wo ich wohn, Mama
Dein kleiner Junge ist erwachsen geworden
Und ich weiß jetzt, wo ich hingehör', mach dir keine Sorgen
Ich denke deutsch, träume deutsch, spreche Deutsch
Hab mich gefunden und ich bin auf meine Herkunft stolz
Es ist halt schwer, wenn du jung und Immigrant bist
In 'nem anderen Land bist
Der Groschen fällt, wenn du ein Mann bist
Ich hab so viel in der Fremde erreicht
Hab die Sprache gelernt und die Menschen erreicht
Als Junge war ich ignorant, doch lernte dann dazu
Wenn du dich nicht akzeptierst, wird es auch kein anderer tun
Denn dieses Land war gut zu mir, meiner Familie auch
Und wenn man hinfällt, steht man eben wieder auf
Wir hab'n so vieles drauf, zeigt mal etwas mehr davon
Endlich Mama, ich weiß jetzt, wo ich herkomm'

Ich bin heut' erwachsen, ich bin hier angekommen
Und all die Aufregung, sie war ganz umsonst
Wenn du dich anstrengst, kriegst du deine faire Chance
Mama, heute weiß ich, wo ich herkomm'
Heute weiß ich, es lief alles ein bisschen doof
Es war für uns alle eine neue Situation
Es wurde Zeit, dass wir uns etwas näherkommen
Denn heute weiß ich, weiß ich, wo ich herkomm'",Wo komm ich her (Deutscher Traum),2014

Es fehlt Kommunikation in der Comedy-Fraktion
Ihr könnt arbeiten, geh kopieren, ich arbeit bis spät um 4
Eko Fresh, bester Text, die Wahrheit auf dem Papier
Gar keine Gegner hier für Ferris and me
Denn beim rappen sind wir Specialists, wie Harris und Dean
Penner du siehst, der Freezman ist einflussreich
Lass dich über die Brücke schmeißen, ein Fluss reicht
Ich bin tight, jeder Spasti hält dem Bora seine Hand hin
Trinke und seh rosa Elefanten, rap sogar wenn ich krank bin
Deshalb liebt mich die Straße, das Volk

Ich wurd' berühmt, doch war im Ghetto am Start
Denn ein paar Featureparts konnten Mamas Rechnung nicht zahlen
Und wer Beef mit mir wollte, brauchte nur ein falsches Wort sagen
Deutsche Gangsterapper killen ist eine meiner Vorstrafen
Solang man funktioniert, sind sie alle hochzufrieden
Nun dann wurd' ich totgeschwiegen, doch ich war nicht tot zu kriegen
Hab's getan, während eure Drohungen nur Drohung blieben
Rap ist mein Haus und du darfst dir keine Wohnung mieten
Keks bellen und denken, so macht man Rapgeld
Aber keiner hat mit 19 auf sein Konto sechs Stellen
Fahrt mal eure Filme und seit endlich zufrieden
Bin ich auch, denn jetzt sind es sieben

Und auf Klassenfahrt im Suff durch den Maschendraht geguckt
Schlage mich fast nie, hab auch nicht jahrelang gedealt

Treff mich und Erol Abi in der Street
Und der Status in der Szene wird ab jetzt radikal gefreezet

Ihr wart im Kampf gestern, ihr seid im Kampf heute
Und als wär’ das Leben nicht schwer genug
Fließt in mancher unserer Gegenden sehr viel Blut
Gott, sag’ mir, was man gegen die Schmerzen tut
Dabei sind wir doch gesegnet und herzensgut
Selbst in Deutschland machen sie kein’ Halt davor
Trennen sich nach der Rasse aus dem alten Dorf
Wir haben hier alle in der Schufa ’nen Eintrag
Was verfasst du gegen deinen Bruder ’nen Beitrag?
Was für ’n scheiß Tag - im Viertel fragt ’n großer Junge:
„Eko, bist du Türke oder ein Kurde?“
Jedes Mal gibt das meiner Seele ein’ Stich
Würd’ am liebsten sagen „Weißt du, dass du fehlgeleitet bist?“
Denn hinter deinem starken „Bekenn dich, bekenn dich!“
Liegt ’ne große Unsicherheit, ich kenn’ dich
Ich bin dein Spiegelbild, ich bin genau wie du
Habe meine Identität auch gesucht
Mir nicht ausgesucht, im Exil aufzuwachsen
Aber ich entschied mich später, viel draus zu machen
Wir sind alle Brüder, also laber kein’ Mist, lan
Mach’ kein Propaganda wie Amis gegen Islam
Denk mal an Suruç, denk mal an Ankara
Unser Volk hat gelitten, wie kein anderer
Hier sind wir Immigranten, Auswanderer
Heut bleib’ ich zuhaus, Mama hat noch Mantı da
Und wenn so ’n Rapper versucht, euch zu trennen
Sag ihm, Bruder, unser Blut ist dasselbe
Ich hab’ schon ’02 unsere Flagge gezeigt
In mei’m Clip, aber nicht aus Hass und dem Scheiß
Sondern aus Liebe, denn wenn der Tag mal verstreicht
In der Nacht, unterm Halbmond sind wir alle gleich, yeah

Jedes Viertel hört es auf dem Handy, laut
Wir sind alle Brüder, das ist Gänsehaut
Dieser Moment, wenn man sich zusammenreißt
Denn unterm Halbmond sind wir alle gleich

Nachts unterm Halbmond sind wir alle gleich
Nachts unterm Halbmond sind wir alle gleich

Wir sind alle Eins!

Im Herzen sind wir rein, eigentlich sind wir alle gleich
Die Außenfassade wirkt anders, wir bestehen aus Blut und Fleisch
Die Gedanken sind frei, ich weiß, du denkst dir dein’ Teil
Aber ändern kannst du gar nichts, wenn du ruhig bist und schweigst
Die Geschichte beweist, es waren kostbare Menschen
Als Türken und Kurden als Osmanen kämpften
Und heute, wenn du überlegst, werden wir getrennt
Mann, ich scheiß auf eure Politik, der Mensch, der ist Mensch
Denn im Endeffekt bestrafen wir uns gegenseitig, nur
Der Eine liegt im Grab, sodass er lebenslänglich ruht
Doch wozu? Selbst hier sind wir verteilt auf dem Weg in die Schule
Ich liebe alles, was du bietest, jede Imbissbude
Denn wir sind auf der Suche, nach einem Heilmittel
Renn’ nicht vor Problemen weg, denn das machen nur Feiglinge
Ein Drittel unserer Bevölkerung muss erwachen
Leider kann ich außer das zu schreiben auch nicht mehr machen
Wein’ nicht, mein Bruder, du musst glücklich sein, damit wir lachen
Denn am Ende sind wir uns beide ähnlich, du bist ein Kanake
Es ist nicht leicht, wir kämpfen, um zu überleben
Schau’ dir mal die Medien an, überall sind wir vertreten
Leider meistens negativ, sie tun das, damit’s jeder sieht
Eigentlich wollen wir Frieden, wir wollen weder Böses weder Krieg
Denn man sagt doch öfter, dass die Bildung schuld ist
Doch die Eltern sind das A und O der Kinder, die Erziehung kann was ändern

Hier sind wir Immigranten, Auswanderer
Heut’ bleib’ ich zu Haus’, Mama macht mir Baklava
Ein Blick in die Vergangenheit, Türken, Kurden, el ele
Ein großes Beispiel dafür sind die Gräber in Çanakkale
Eine Generation, die sich aufgeopfert hat
Damit die Jugend, heutzutage, auch was davon hat
Ich meine Frieden, denn wenn der Tag mal verstreicht
In der Nacht, unterm Halbmond sind wir alle gleich, yeah

Jedes Viertel hört es auf dem Handy, laut
Wir sind alle Brüder, das ist Gänsehaut
Dieser Moment, wenn man sich zusammenreißt
Denn unterm Halbmond sind wir alle gleich

Nachts unterm Halbmond sind wir alle gleich
Nachts unterm Halbmond sind wir alle gleich

Der Junkie, der sich spritzt an der Ecke direkt bei Lidl
Vierzehn, sie ist schwanger und ein Stenz die erste Liebe
Man weiß nicht, wer der Vater ist, sie hätte Sex mit vielen
Alleinerziehende Mutter, mieser Job, Leben lang
Ein Pädophiler wohnt siebter Stock nebenan
Und während im Moment das Flüchtlingsheim am Brennen ist
Kommt der Börsenhai frei, er spielt mit dem Richter Tennis
Hinterhofbars in Kalk, toter Winkel der Staatsgewalt
Und der Lehrer trinkt sich ein Glas mit Alk
Sein Schüler kam unter die Räder des Systems
Er sitzt lebenslang und quält sich mit Hepatitis C
Er musste wegen einem Strohmann gehen
Seine Frau wartet zu Hause, dass der Strom angeht
Wenn juckt's solang es RTL nicht zeigt?

War es arschkalt, als das Baby in der Tonne lag
Wann die Hure für paar Brotkrümmel lutscht
Als den Bullen aus der Nase noch ein Kokskrümmel guckt
Es ist Neukölln Kreisverkehr, schwarzer X6
Der sich dem Drive-by nähert, sag, war das die 31 wert?
Der Familienvater ist für Bankkredit am Betteln
Spielschulden, angesichts dessen kann ihn nichts mehr retten
Irgenwelche Instagramschlampen sind am Chatten
Flamme unterm Löffel und der Junkie ist am Lächeln

Ich bin gar nicht mal so clever, wie's mir zugeschrieben wird

Wie soll ich sagen, von eher Langsamen betrieben wird
Alle klingen irgendwie nach GD 2005

Bis mich irdische Gesetze in die Truhe zwingen

Klar bin ich nicht perfekt, ich verstell' mich aber nicht

Du bist korrekt, aber mittlerweile Asbach, Bro
Du bist out, hör mal auf mit rappen, lass mal los
Brudi, niemand kauft dir mehr ein Album ab“ – ach wo?
Was weißt du von meinem Schmerz, du kleiner Kahbasohn?
Ich bin schon achtmal gefallen und schafft' es acht mal hoch
Ich versetz mich in die Zeit, wo ich in Gladbach wohnt'
Rap war hungrig und ergreife mir die Macht, den Thron
Ich bin ein friedlicher Mensch, doch habe Kriege gekämpft
Dieses Talent setzt mich heute in den miesesten Benz
Sie sagen: „Ja klar, Eko schreibt nur über seine Patte
Darüber dass es kacke lief, er früher gar nix hatte“
Halt um solche Themen scheint das Album sich zu drehen
Doch was soll ich denn noch schreiben? Das ist alles, was ich seh'
Alles, was ich fühl', sind diese Ausländerkomplexe
Das ich nur ein Haufen Dreck bin, deshalb tausende von Texte
Ihr wollt mich tot sehen, mein Brot nehmen?
Auf euch trinke Rosé von Moët
Ihr wolltet mich zum Scheitern bringen
Ich werd' mir euren Neid erzwingen
Ich kam vom Reis mit dem Ketchup bis zu Eis am Ring
Und jetzt guck mal, wie die Scheiße blinkt
Tausende Jubel, was für 'ne Karriere, Bruder
Doch danach im Auto spürst du nix als Leere, Bruder
Mit dir rumhängen wär' mir zwar eine Ehre, Bruder
Aber ich hab' keine Zeit, dreh' 'ne Serie, Bruder
Bin nicht da, um mich mit diese Schweinen zu versöhnen
Und Kida sagt mir immer: „Eko, zeig's diesen Hurensöhnen“
Und was jetzt, und was jetzt? Wer wollt' mit mir ficken?
Dachtet ihr, ich hab' nicht mehr den Erfolg zum Verticken?
Und ich komm' nicht klar mit dem heutigen Niveau
Nur weil es im Internet jetzt ein paar Neue gibt und so (woo)

Und dich der Dönerladen sponsert?
Was wisst ihr in eurer Müsliwelt, ihr Keks?
Meine Fam buckelt schon Leben lang für irgendwelche Chefs
Habe niemals was besessen, nicht mal 'n würdigen Respekt
Und der erste, der den Kreis brach, ist der Pöbelrapper Ek
Krieg' sie irgendwie nicht weg, die fucking Existenzangst
Brudi, fick die Oberschicht, ich geh' abhängen mit den Gangstern
Obwohl Haus schon abbezahlt ist, Auto abbezahlt ist
Fühl' ich mich, als ob Gerichtsvollzieher draußen auf mich warten

Was ist das für eine Welt, als Reicher kriegst du alles free

Heut weiß ich mit einem Blick über deinen Fakecharakter bescheid

Bitch, zehntes Album ist nice, auf meinem Label, wir

Glaubst du, dass dein Leben schon kaputt sei?
Dann komm in meine, komm in meine, komm in meine, komm in meine Hood rein
Wo der Tod hier geweiht ist, hier sind manche Großmütter dreißig
Fast jeder wird gesucht, irgendwo Polizeilicht
Und dem Sohn ist es peinlich, weil die Wohnung zu klein ist
Wenn er Homies vorbei bringt, hat er kein Selbstbewusstsein
Komm in meine, komm in meine, komm in meine, komm in meine Hood rein

Wo du deiner Mama etwas Para auf die Couch legst

Wie wir uns begegnet sind, ich kann es nicht vergessen

Weil Vater bringt Feuer anstatt Blumen mit nach Hause

Also Kul charra, ich bin wie Magic, du ein Fredo

Bei ihm läuft auch, aber leider nur die Chemo

Machte ich im BMW und hupte
Weil wenn ich auf Tracks nicht angeben dürfte
Ich ein Angebertürke bei Andreas Türck wär
Und sollt ich erfahr'n, ich rapp prollig und arm
Schmeiß ich voll die Banan', wie auf Oliver Kahn
Was soll ich nur sag'n, schön das jeder deine Fresse sah
Schön das sie gestern kam, bei Stefan Raab
So verdienst du jeden Cent ohne Spar'n

Wie kann das sein, ich dachte VIVA liebt mich
Ich wär lieber niedlich, wie Jeanette Biedermann, und switche mein Image, und fang
Jetzt wieder an
Alles was ich bisher sagte, nehm' ich zurück
Guten Tag, guten Tag, ich will mein Leben zurück

Dass ist scheisse, doch sie haben niemanden die Frau geklaut
Wer braucht Frauen!?
Ich habe mich von jeder getrennt
Und schickte sie mit ihren lieblichen Fehlern zu Ben
Jeder Mensch ist Mensch, weil er kifft und weil er trinkt
Weil er Optik schiebt, weil er fickt und weil er stinkt
Und von mir aus halte mich für ein Trottel, ich habe jetzt 'ne Webcam
Ich zeig dir meine Maiglocken
Du hast kein Bock, schreib in einem Fax zu Schröder
Meine Fratze wär blöder, als die von Atze Schröder

Eko Fresh,"Yeah, es waren Abbas der Ingenieur und seine Frau Samira
Liebten ihr Kind so sehr, die kleine Maus Fatima
Politisch war im Land zurzeit ein raues Klima
Nach dem ersten Krieg brach ein zweiter aus – schon wieder?
Wo sie wohnten, traten Anschläge verstärkt auf
Und eines Tages riss man Abbas' gutes Herz raus
Kam von der Arbeit und spürt seinen Kreislauf
Etwas war passiert, denn die Tür, sie stand weit auf
Er kriegt 'n Schock, und zwar 'nen gewaltigen
Als er sieht, wie drei Mann Samira vergewaltigen
IS-Milizen, die das Viertel am Erobern waren
Als er dann sein Kind in 'ner Pfütze auf dem Boden sah
War es zu viel, weshalb er schreiend auf die Männer zuging
Er wollte sie mit bloßen Händen umbringen
Aber er schafft' es nicht, denn es ballern Wummen
Und die Lichter gingen aus – alles dunkel

Abbas wacht auf, er fiel durch den Streifschuss in Ohnmacht
Sie dachten wahrscheinlich, dass er tot war
Die Männer waren weg, die Wohnung war verwüstet
Er half Samira langsam wieder hoch auf ihre Füße
Sie hat geblutet und weinte wegen Fatima
Roch nach dem Samen und dem Schweiß von ihren Peinigern
Die Tochter war schwach, ihre Hose war nass
Ihr Gesicht grün und blau, was macht man ohne 'nen Arzt?
Abbas hatte sein Erspartes in 'nem Buch versteckt
Sie hatten's nicht gefunden – „Komm, wir müssen nur hier weg!“
Ohne zu packen schlichen sie um Häuser und Ecken
Um sich mitten in der Nacht mit einem Schleuser zu treffen
Zahlten und stiegen in sein Boot, wie viele in der Not
Mitten auf dem Meer und sie kriegten nicht mal Brot
Ohne Medizin, waren zu lange unterwegs
Und die kleine Fatima hat die Fahrt nicht überlebt

Leben oder sterben, Abbas war hin- und hergerissen
Die Leiche seiner Tochter hatte er ins Meer geschmissen
Sie kamen am Ufer an, dann war der Fußmarsch lang
Zäune und Mauern, bis man endlich mit dem Zug fahren kann
Am Bahnhof ein Schild, „Refugee welcome“
Nahm Samira in den Arm, „Jetzt wird sich alles ändern!“
Etliche Wochen in denselben Klamotten
Alles verloren, sie begannen endlich zu hoffen
Die Gruppe ist dann in 'nen Bus eingestiegen
An der Turnhalle wurden sie dann kurz eingewiesen
Es war dreckig und voll, doch ihnen war's egal, weil
Sie brauchten nur ein Bett und eine warme Mahlzeit
So erschöpft, haben sich 'ne Liege geteilt
Ihre Liebe gezeigt und dann schliefen sie ein
In der Nacht steckten Nazis ihr Heim in Brand
Sie riefen, „Scheiß Asylant!“",Life Goes On [Instrumental],2017

Ich hab's geschafft, sie schreiben jetzt meinen Nachnamen richtig

Scheißegal! Ich mach' mein Ding wie es sein muss
Oh, keiner nimmt auf mich Einfluss
Oh, ich sag' es zum letzten Mal
Was irgendeiner denkt, ist mir scheißegal

Scheißegal!
Scheißegal!

Was wollt ihr von mir?
Ich bin volltätowiert und erfolgreich, kapiert?
Mit Kritik wird der Hintern geputzt
Was denkst du, was mich irgendwer im Internet juckt? Eh
Mann, es prallt an mir ab
Denn auf diesem Weg wird kein Halt mehr gemacht
Von unten nach oben, over the top
Hater werden kurz von der Schulter geklopft
Ich bleib' wie ich bin und geh' nicht mit dem Strom
Ich hab' das Gewinnersyndrom
Bleib' fokussiert, mach' mein Ding wie gewohnt
Hab' nur einen Chef und dis ist mein Sohn

Oh, denn ich pass' mich nicht an
Oh, und ich mach' ganz entspannt
Oh, Stresser können mich mal
Was irgendeiner denkt, ist mir scheißegal

Scheißegal!
Scheißegal!
Scheißegal!
Scheißegal!

Was die labern, ist mir so egal
Ich frag' mich, wo sie waren, als ich am Boden war
Es wird zu viel geredet und wenig gehandelt
Jetzt kommt ihr an, wo mein Leben entspannt ist
Komm mit oder nicht, dieser Wagen rollt
Werde nie sein so wie ihr mich haben wollt
Ich mach', was ich will, Hauptsache, ?
Wo wär' ich heut, hätt' ich auf euch gehört, heh?
Ich bin teflonbeschichtet
Ich schreib' mit einem Rapsong Geschichte
Denn nur ich hab' mein Life in der Hand
Heute Nacht wird aus der Reihe getanzt, komm

Oh, nein, du ziehst mich nicht runter
Oh, halt mal lieber den Mund, Mann
Oh, ich bin ein Original
Was irgendeiner denkt, ist mir scheißegal

Scheißegal!
Scheißegal!
Scheißegal!
Scheißegal!

Du hast deinen eigenen Stil
Hater labern einfach zu viel – scheißegal!
Dreh die Mucke bis zum Anschlag
Schauen, was der Nachbar dann sagt – scheißegal!
Tja, deine Ex ist weg
Heb das Glas und ex es weg
Heute ist dein Tag, also gönn dir mal
Scheißegal!

Egal, egal, egal
Egal, egal, egal
Egal, egal, egal
Egal, egal, egal
Egal, egal, egal
Egal, egal, egal

Moment mal, hm – da überlegste, ne?
Ek kann leider keinen pushen, das verstehste, ne?

Der sogar wenn er schläft, ein paar Reime übt, ne?
Nur damit ihr wisst, was euch jetzt leider blüht, ne?
Hat er wieder dieses Album wie ein Ei gebrütet
Disserei ist doch größtenteils aus Neid, ne?
Na gut, bring mir 'ne Coke, aber Light, ne?
Zehntes Soloalbum, Bro, weißte Bescheid, ne?

Dumme 31er, wo bleibt eure Würde?
Ich erwürge Journalisten und häng' ab mit deutschen Türken
So wie Eko Freezy, easy does it, Peace an meine Freunde
Wenn du Beef hast, denkst du, irgendwelche Toys wären deine Leute, ne?
Ich chill' mit geilen Bräuten, ne? Du hängst nur mit Männern ab
Proletik ist das Label, das die allerbesten Rapper hat
Ich kenne kein Limit, nein, ich stecke dir meinen Pimmel rein
Einmal Pornorapper und du wirst immer Pornorapper sein
Das hier ist der New-Orleans-Bounce, Nutte
Von Köln bis Westberlin, ne, ne? Bounce, Nutte

Wenn wir kollaborieren, wir haben viel zu verdienen

Eko Fresh,"Manchmal denkst du drüber nach, wenn du älter wirst
Und schaust Fernsehen – was ist mit der Welt passiert?
Geld regiert, jeder ist nur noch Egoist
Für viele ist jeder Moslem ein Terrorist
Sie fliehen übers Meer vor unsern Maschinengewehren
Doch Asyl wollen wir ihnen nicht gewähren
Guck, ich dreh' meine Runden im Ghetto
Und denke an den kleinen Jungen aus Aleppo
Wir teilen Fakenews bei Facebook
Ganz Europa durchlebt einen Rechtsruck
Jede Woche schon wieder ein Anschlag
Den die Mächtigen besiegeln per Handschlag
Und die Ärmeren zeigen mit dem Finger auf sich gegenseitig
Werden wir den Frieden noch erleben? Weiß nicht
Wo ist die Humanität?
Kann man der Jugend erzählen, welche Zukunft sie erlebt?

Und ich frage mich selbst, ist das alles noch gut?
Oder sind wir verloren? Was ist mit der Welt passiert? Oh oh
Ist das alles für Geld, was wir hier wieder tun?
Ist die Liebe erfroren? Was ist mit der Welt passiert? Oh oh

Eh, Eko, guck, ich weiß genau, wovon du redest, Bruder
Wir sehen kein Ufer, während wir um unser Leben rudern
Seitdem ich denken kann sind Menschen auf das Geld fixiert
Red' nicht vom Wetter, wenn ich sage, dass es kälter wird
Die schlimmsten Zeiten seit dem Holocaust
Ich weiß, die ganzen Themen hängen dir aus den Ohren raus
Doch manche Dinge muss man sagen
Und auch wenn unsre Worte in den Hintergrund geraten, wir sind immer noch am warten
Auf den Tag, an dem man endlich unsre Stimmen hört
Ich stand im Gaza, sah, wie all das auf die Kinder wirkt
Lass die Vergangenheit vergehen, bevor es schlimmer wird
Die Gegenwart hat ihre Zukunft ohnehin zerstört
Ich hab' es damals schon gesagt, unserm Land scheint es gut zu geh'n
Dafür fließen anderswo Blut und Tränen
Sag mir, wann kommt der Friede? Wir stellen Fragen über Kampfsport und Kriege
Dabei wissen wir, die Antwort ist Liebe, Trip!

Und ich frage mich selbst, ist das alles noch gut?
Oder sind wir verloren? Was ist mit der Welt passiert? Oh oh

Es ist nicht so, dass wir's nicht wüssten
Und manchmal tun wir intressiert
Doch macht es uns nicht wirklich Sorgen
Solang es anderswo passiert
Sind wir füreinander da, oder jeder nur für sich?
Reißen wir uns doch zusammen, oder geht das einfach nicht?
Andauernd Kriege, wann ist denn Friede?
So viele Fragen, die Antwort ist Liebe, oh oh
Die Antwort ist Liebe, oh oh

Zwischen Mahmuts, Helmuts und den Sergejs
Immer das Gefühl, man würd' für die Clique sterben
Hehe, wir dachten, dass wir Ticker werden
Mitten im Pennerlife, Digga, ballerten Weed oder Weiß, Digga
Du standst zu mir, ich stand zu dir als Einziger, ich weiß, Digga

Dann kam langsam der Erfolg, ich versprach dir doch, dich mitzunehmen
Doch hab' beim ersten bisschen Fame deinen Blick gesehen

Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass es einmal endet
Durch dich muss ich erfahren, dass sich jedes Blatt auch wendet
Wir können nicht mehr teilen, was ist und einmal war
Die Erinnerung an dich nehm' ich mit in mein Grab

Ich hätte für mein Bruderherz den rechten Arm gegeben
Und jetzt fängst du an zu beten, praying for my downfall
Was ist los? Ich dacht', wir leben unsern Traum fort
Wir haben die Welt geteilt, selber Film, selber Hype
Doch kaum kam das Geld dann rein, fingst du an ein Kelb zu sein
Machst du etwa Auge? Denn wenn es drauf ankommt
Wirst du zum Blutsauger, so ähnlich wie ein Tampon
Weißt du, wie weit ich dir traue? So weit, wie ich dich werfen kann
Ich hab' es dir geöffnet und dann setztest du mein Herz in Flammen
Hoffe, du bist broke, wenn du morgens in den Spiegel schaust
Doch für mich bist du gestorben, das Spiel ist aus

Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass es einmal endet
Durch dich muss ich erfahren, dass sich jedes Blatt auch wendet

Eko Fresh,"„Ok, meine Damen und Herren
Dies der offizielle Ri-mi-mi-mi-mix, Mix Mix
Für Mitbürger mit Migrationshintergrund“

Ich sag, woo
Sie nennen uns Mimimis
Mitbürger mit Migrationshintergrund
Viele von uns sind hier geboren
Doch die Herkunft steht immer im Mittelpunkt
Leute fragen mich, woher ich komm'
Ich sage, ich komme aus Hamburg City
Sie sagen: „Ne, du weißt schon, was ich meine!“
Dabei war die Antwort richtig
Sie sagen, ich spreche ja toll deutsch
Fragen mich, wo hab' ich das so gut gelernt
Ich muss runterkomm', ich schwör', ich roll' 'n Joint
Und, und höre auf, den Menschen zuzuhören
Ich schwör', genauso wie es damals war
Ist es noch immer in der Gegenwart, eh
Ich kenn' das seit mei'm ersten Lebensjahr
Die Leute wollen's nicht einsehen, doch ich leb' hier schon mein Leben lang
Und wenn ich mecker' über dieses Land
Sagen sie: „Geh doch hin woher du kommst!“
Okay, dann geh' ich halt nach Eppendorf
Ich hab' auch angefangen mit Rappen dort
Aber das ist nicht, was du meintest, ne
Du willst, dass ich in meine Heimat geh'
Ich schwör', dies' Land hier ist so ignorant
Was? Wahrscheinlich bricht es bald 'n Weltrekord
Ich hab' hier niemandem 'n Job geklaut
Yeah, ich hab' hier vielen Leuten Jobs gegeben
Guck ma, dies hier geht raus an meine Mimimis
Sie mögen es nicht, wenn wir offen reden
Halb deutsch, halb Ausländer
Es heißt, ich führe ein Doppelleben
Und ich schaue hoch in Himmel, um zu Gott zu beten
Sag mal, kennt ihr auch ein paar Mimimis?
Mimimis, Mimimis, „Mitbürger mit Migrationshintergrund“

„Und jetzt der nächste Mimimi
Hier live und direkt
Illegal immigriert aus Ostafrika
Mein Mann Afrob“

Yeah, ey ey, Alter, was diese „Mimimi""?
Ich bin Intensivtäter, German Dream
Das ist Afrob made in Germany
Das Boot ist voll, Deutschland, Hysterie
Huh, sie nennen mich „Public Enemy“ (Enemy)
Im Fadenkreuz der AFD (AFD)
Sie sagen, ich wär primitiv (was?)
Lügenpresse ARD, ja, Leute, das ist Hassliebe
Ich hab keine Zeit, Mann, ich hab Krise
Ich mach Plus und ich mach Miese
Arbeite an Maschinen, bevor sie mich abschieben
Leute machen falschen Vergleich (Vergleich)
Es geht nicht um schwarz oder weiß (oh, nein)
Es geht um arm oder reich
Und wer das nicht begreift, ja, na dann tut's mir leid
Alter, was diese „Mimimi“?
Liegestuhl, Kampf am Strandbad von Rimini?
Kein Problem, da mach ich auch mit, ich bitte Sie
Gern billige Arbeitskraft für die Industrie
Ah, ich kenne alle deutschen Kaiser
Peter, Alexander und noch Hans Meiser
Sing das Lied der Deutschen, doch nicht alle drei Strophen
Eine ist erlaubt und die zwei sind verboten
Ich bin ein Immigrant, ein Gigant, Asylant
Braungebrannt, für dich bin ich sogar militant
„Oh mein Gott, die Kanaken nehmen überhand“
Jetzt ist sie weg, diese übergroße Toleranz
Die BRD wird überrant
Brauchen jetzt den nationalen Widerstand
Der Untergang des Abendlands, Lage ist sehr angespannt
So brisant, keine Angst, denn ich bin doch nur ein

Mimimi, Mimimi, Mimimi
„Mitbürger mit Migrationshintergrund“

„Yo! Und der nächste Mimimi
Macht einmal Applaus
Für meinen Mann MoTrip
Aus'm Libanon hierher gekommen“

Ah, eine Frage: bin ich wirklich deutsch
Oder gebe ich mich nur als Deutscher aus?
Umm, was soll ich sagen, Mann, ich fühl mich deutsch, yeah
Doch ich seh nicht wie ein Deutscher aus
Und jeder denkt, er wüsste, wer du bist
Terrorist, davon gehen die Deutschen aus
Okay, nicht alle, doch ich kenn mich mit Deutschen aus
Seit neustem grenzen mich die Deutschen aus
Geh und sag den Deutschen, Ausländer sind nur Menschen
Auf der Flucht, deshalb rennen wir über Grenzen
Ich hab dazu gelernt, ich kenn' die Konsequenzen
Doch ich putze keine Schuhe mehr, ich kämpfe, um zu glänzen
Sie reden ständig nur von Ängsten
Lenken, was du denkst auf allen Sendern und Frequenzen
Und auch wenn wir uns am Ende doch ergänzen
Denken sich die Menschen
Lass mal mit den fremden Kontinenten
Wo soll das enden? Shit, ich glaub, dass es aus ist (aus ist)
So mancher hier verfault, bis er braun ist (braun ist)
Auf der Vergangenheit 'ne faustdicke Staubschicht
Ein ganz schmaler Grad zwischen Klausnitz und Auschwitz
Und diese Ghettos haben wir selbst gemacht
Viele Kinder wachsen auf ohne Aussicht (ja)
Ja, ich weiß, wir leben beide in der selben Stadt
Doch ich spüre dein Vertrauen überhaupt nicht
Und geh ich raus, gibt's Probleme mit den Rechten
Und vor Gericht dann Probleme mit den Rechten
Wenn du das mit Menschen machst
Dann endet das im Fremdenhass
Und heutzutage nenn' wir das Probleme, die sich rächten
Halb Mensch, halb Mimimi, yeah
Kein Killer, wie man ihn im Krimi sieht
Wir sind clean, doch sehen aus wie auf Tilidin
Mein Lieblingslied ist bis heute „Billie Jean“, ja, ich bin ein

Mimimi, Mimimi, Mimimi
„Mitbürger mit Migrationshintergrund“

„Yo! Ok ok, wollt ihr noch mehr Mimimis
Hier heut' Abend sehen?
Ihr müsst noch 'n bisschen warten
Ich erzähl' euch kurz was“

Yeah, ich sag dies' der Re-mi-mi-mix
Für Mitbürger mit Migrationshintergrund
Remix, viele von uns sind hier geboren
Doch die Herkunft steht immer im Mittelpunkt
Die Menschlichkeit ist ein Minimum
Sie schalten unsre Stimmen stumm
Sie nannten uns als Kinder dumm
Wir waren wie DJ Khaled, sie wollen nicht, dass wir gewinnen
Und schauten uns mit Mitleid an, als wär' es 'ne Behinderung
Hoo, heute rulen Mimimis
Boateng hängt mit Jigga rum
Gäb es hier keine Mimimis, huh
Dann gäb es hier auch keine Entwicklung, Statement
Robert kam damals aus Afrika, ah
So wie auch viele andere Habescha
Heut ist er ein nationaler Star
Und gewinnt Awards in Kanada, Gratulation
Uh, ich bin stoned, Mann, wo waren wir grad?
Ohladidadida, so viele Nazis da, so krasse Party grad
Lass mich diesen Beat hier killen
Eko hat 'ne Serie und einen eigenen Kinofilm
Nicht schlecht für'n Quotentürken, lass den Flow hier wirken
Dies geht an alle Mimimis in allen Wohnbezirken
Trip kam aus Libanon, nahm ein Mikrofon
Heute hat er viel Erfolg, Mimimis kriegen Gold, woo
„Hey, mach mal'n Song gegen Nazis, Sam“
Warum? Ich versteh das nicht
Ich hab noch nie was gegen die gehabt (sag es)
Die hatten immer etwas gegen mich
Lasst uns Fremden doch die Hand geben, yo
Anstatt hier jeden Tag 'n Brand legen
Und ohne viel Kollateralschäden
Hier in Frieden in diesem Land leben, alle meine

„Oh yes
Und jetzt macht mal Lärm für einen echten Mimimi
Einen echten Quotentürken

Ich bin der Vorzeige Kanake (Kanake)
Aber kann besser als viele deutsch (viele deutsch)
Jeder Türke klopft mir auf die Schulter (klopf klopf!)
Aber keiner, der sich Freezy käuft
Bisschen Fremdenhass liegt in der Luft
Gruß geht an die Pegida (Hoo Hoo)
Ich geh Samstagabend in den Puff (und?)
Und frage: „Ist die Peggi da?“
Manche machen einen auf korrekt
Dann nimm doch einen Flüchtling auf
Ich bin kein strenger Musilman
Aber esse Mama Müsli auf
Tja, das ist wie der Ek so ist
Ich date heut Beate Zschäpe
Sie sieht aus wie bei Exorzist (aber?)
Aber kennst ja, einmal blasen geht, ne?
Ja, ich bin ein Mimimi
Heul doch, Digga, Mimimi
Kanaken hören Jiggi-Beats
Verkaufen dir das Billigweed für ziemlich viel, hihihi
Der Ekrem ist aus Türkiye (Türkiye)
Und Samy ist aus Afrika (Afrika)
Hab das Handy, noch 'ne Karte da, die hängen ab in Altana
„Ich kenn deinen Bruder“, Klassiker
Wo sind meine Gutmenschen?
Komm, wir gehen Blut spenden
Oder ist jetzt wegen Seehofer für uns alle Game Over
Und ich muss meinen Flug canceln?
Halb Mensch, halb Ausländer
Sie nennen mich den Schwarzkopf
Alles klar, Bruder, dieses Jahr bekenn' ich mich zum Arschloch

Hallo, ich bin ein Mimimi, Mimimi, Mimimi

„Noch ein special Mimimi
Mein Mann Chefket aus Berlin
Via der Türkei
Let's go, Bro“

Dis is' Chefket, kein Vorzeigetürke, Rapshit
Ich komm so rein, dann gibt es später kein Missverständnis
Ich hab das beste aus zwei Kulturen in mir vereint
Am plakativsten wär' jetzt 'n bisschen Spätzle und Chai
Bilingual mit zwei, trilingual mit zehn
In zwei Ländern zu Hause und ich kann alles verstehen
Doch viele wollten mich verarschen während ich mit Farben klecker'
Sie kommen und sagen: „Nur eine Farbe wäre besser“
Ich war nie gut im Mal- und Kunstunterricht
Schwarzweiß kann ich nicht malen, wenn alles bunt ist für mich
Und wenn man sich den Kopf über die fremde Dummheit zerbricht
Stellt sich die Frage: Warum eigentlich?
Einerseits, andererseits, ich bin mitten drin
Isst du Schweinefleisch? Nur wenn sie beschnitten sind
Identität kann für mich nichts damit zu tun
Irgendwelche Nationalhymnen mitzusingen

Que han dejado sus heridas
Y que tu corazón te han lastimado
Y hoy cree que mis palabras son mentiras

Yo se que hoy t han echo tanto daño
Y que un dolor que es hondo no se olvida puedes poner
Tu alma entre mis manos
Que yo la cuidare mientas que viva

T voy amar con ternura, pasión, con locura
Con sinceridad, como no te han amado jamás
Te lo puedo jurar necesito tan solo
De ti una oportunidad

Te voy amar y romper el silencio que reina en tu soledad
Quiero ser tu delirio, tu fuerza
Tu debilidad y volverme por siempre
El esclavo de tu voluntad

Te voy amar, quiero ser tu delirio
Tú fuerza, tu debilidad
Y volverme por siempre
El esclavo de tu voluntad

Permítame que borre cada beso
El sin sabor que aun llevas
En los labios a veces cuándo hay tanto sufrimiento
El tiempo no consigue eliminarlos

Y deja que me encargue poco a poco de renovar la fe
Que habías perdido vengo a quedarme indefinidamente
Y amarte como siempre lo has querido

Parecíamos dos críos nerviosos por encontrarnos
Como te trata la vida, como te tratan los años
Qué alegría volver a verte y ver que en ti nada ha cambiado

Un bocata, una cerveza por el callejón
Y sentí con alegría como nos aplaudía el corazón

Y volvimos a ser guerreros por la libertad
Y la luna nos presto la llave

Maullando en el tejado de la princesa del barrio
Volvimos a ponerle pegamento a nuestras vidas
Y a cantar por camarón por todas las esquinas

Paseamos por el barrio rebuscando en sus paredes
Los nombres de viejos colegas con los nuestros aparecen
Éramos una familia que se divierte y se defiende
Cuantas guerras en la espalda guiñándole un ojo a la suerte

Si te tengo a ti no quiero nada más
Si yo te tengo a ti, me sobra todo lo demás
Me gusta tu sonrisa bruja, me gusta
Lo que a ti te gusta, tu mosqueillo tu ternura
Me gusta la fiesta y la siesta

En tu cintura

",Si Te Tengo a Ti,2005
El Arrebato,"Dame una razón pa' no quererte
Que yo no encuentro ninguna
Porque nada es suficiente
Para hundir está locura que navega
Por mi mente desde que te vi pasar

Déjame que sueñe con tu boca
Aunque no sientas lo mismo
Déjame que me ilusione con ganarme tu cariño
Porque a nadie le hago daño solamente con soñar

Me tiene como loco tu pelo negro
Me tiene como loco tu condición
Se me desboca el alma cuando te veo
No puedo sujetar a mi corazón

Yo te camelaré pase lo que pase
Yo te camelaré si tengo que esperarme
Vale, me esperaré
Y mientras tanto niña yo me conformaré

Con ser la nada que a ti te lo da todo
Tú eres el todo que a mí no me da nada
Pero soy capaz de robarte la sonrisa
Sólo con decirte guapa

Como quieres que yo no te quiera
Como quieres que te olvide si no encuentro la manera
De borrar la primavera que se enfrenta a tu sonrisa
Cuando pasas junto a mí

Yo sé bien que estoy queriendo solo
Yo sé bien que no te importo pero déjame si sueño
Que es lo único que tengo
Eso y mil quinientos besos diferentes para ti

Me tiene como loco tu pelo negro
Me tiene como loco tu condición
Se me desboca el alma cuando te veo
No puedo sujetar a mi corazón

Yo te camelaré pase lo que pase
Yo te camelaré si tengo que esperarme
Vale, me esperaré
Y mientras tanto niña yo me conformaré

Con ser la nada que a ti te lo da todo
Tú eres el todo que a mí no me da nada
Pero soy capaz de robarte la sonrisa
Sólo con decirte guapa

",Sólo Con Decirte Guapa,2005
El Arrebato,"El brillo de tus ojos confiesa un 'Te quiero'
El no de tu sonrisa me prohíbe el cielo
Princesa testaruda que guarda un secreto
Y cierra de un portazo la ventana del deseo

Pero no existen redes que atrapen los sueños
Lo mismo que no hay puertas en el universo
Yo seguiré la huellas que deja tu miedo
Y las iré borrando poco a poco, beso a beso

Tengo el presentimiento, tengo la sensación
De que cuando estas mirando en realidad
Me estas mandando cartas de amor

Tengo el presentimiento, tengo la sensación
De que cuando tú me miras tus ojillos
Me salpican cartas de amor

Puede que en el fondo me haya vuelto un quijote
Soñando que le aman borracho de ilusiones
Pero si nos miramos se duerme mi duda
Cuando inventa tu mirada el brillo de la luna

Que el brillo de tus ojos me confiese un te quiero
Tu boquita se calla, esta prohibiendo el cielo

",Tengo un Presentimiento,2005
El Arrebato,"Algo ha tenido que ser lo que tú me diste
Algo ha tenido que ser que no soy el mismo
Algo que hace que se enciendan mis alarmas
Pero a la vez de calma y me quita el frió

Contigo una gota de agua se convierte en lago
Contigo una mota de polvo es una montaña
Contigo el planeta parece un terrón de azúcar
Contigo se duerme mi pena y se ensancha el alma

Algo tuvo que ser que no doy pie con bola
Algo que hace que yo por ti quiera
Ser mejor persona
Tu amor, se me sube a la cabeza

Lo mismo que la cerveza
Lo mismo que una emoción
Tu amor es un huracán de flores
Una fiesta de colores dentro de mi corazón

Algo ha tenido que ser lo que tú me diste
Algo que ya ni siquiera yo me conozco
Algo que hace que yo pierda los papeles
Pero a la vez me serena y me da de to

Contigo se van oxidando todos mis defectos
Contigo le di un zapatazo a la soledad
Contigo se quedan dormidas mis indecisiones
Contigo decir un te quiero es decir la verdad

Algo tuvo que ser que no doy pie con bola
Algo que hace que yo por ti quiera
Ser mejor persona
Tu amor se me sube a la cabeza

Lo mismo que la cerveza
Lo mismo que una emoción
Tu amor es un huracán de flores
Una fiesta de colores dentro de mi corazón

Algo tuvo que ser que mira niña
Que no puedo no doy pie con bola
Algo que hace que yo por ti
Quiera ser mejor persona
Tu amor se me sube a la cabeza

Lo mismo que la cerveza
Lo mismo que una emoción
Tu amor es una huracán de flores
Una fiesta de colores dentro de mi corazón

",Tu Amor,2005
El Arrebato,"Mírame a la cara, mírame a los ojos
En ellos vive un duende que se chiva de todo
Y te está gritando que te arrimes un poco
Porque para no quererte niña hay que estar loco

Que se queme el aire que no se vaya el frio
Que haga huelga la luna que se acabe el vino
Que alguien borre las sombras de todos los caminos
Que se acabe el todo pero tu quédate conmigo

Por eso no quiero ver que tus ojillos duden
Aunque a veces la luna me entretenga con su embuste
Como me duele escucharte decir que yo no te quiero

Yo que me sé de memoria las vueltas que da tu pelo
Como me duele que pienses, princesa que no te amo
Si soy capaz de robar la luna y ponerla en tus manos

Ábreme la puerta de tu confianza
No oigas lo que dicen, escucha mi mirada
Y ahora despacito voy a darte un beso
Porque tu boquita esta llamándome en silencio

Yo le canto a las flores
Le canto a las estrellas
Le canto a los amores

Yo le canto a los sueños
¡Ay! Cuando digo tu nombre

¡Cómo!

Esta canción no será bonita
Esta canción no estará bien hecha
Esta canción no estará en la radio
Esta canción no me hará una estrella

Esta canción no tendrá armonía
Ni melodía ni buena letra
Ni un estribillo de esos que rompen
Pero la canto porque me llena

Porque no parte los corazones
Porque no pide a nadie que vuelva
Y se compuso con mucha guasa
Está compuesta pa' los que sueñan

Y yo la canto y la canto
La sigo cantando cuando estoy sereno
Cuando estoy borracho

Y yo la canto y la canto
La sigo cantando cuando yo me acuesto
Cuando me levanto

Esta canción no llora por nadie
Esta canción no tiene poema
A lo mejor no andará en tu coche
Pero la canto porque me llena

Esta canción no dice, ""Te quiero""
Y nadie va a cortarse las venas
Esta canción habla muy poquito
Y dice más de lo que aparenta

De esta canción no se harán canciones
Esta canción no estará en baratas
Esta canción no será tu agosto

Por ti ando maquinando como un enfermo

Tan sólo entrego lo que llevo 
Y día a día te lo regalaba 

Conseguiré dártelo todo 
De dentro de mis sentimientos 
No buscaré ser diferente 
Seré yo mismo, seré valiente 

No volveré a caer 
En querer y no poder 
No dar de mi interior 
Trozos de mi corazón 

No volveré a caer 
En tener y no querer 
En saber que es un final 
Que siempre ha acabado mal 

De atardecer y de lamento 
De todo y nada tengo dentro 
Tan sólo quiero ser yo mismo 
Tan sólo espero ese momento 

De historia acierto sé que ha sido 
De no tenerlo a conseguirlo 
Tan sólo espero mantenerlo 
Tan sólo quiero y sé que puedo",He Vuelto a Caer,2000
El Canto del Loco,"Y el mundo alrededor 
Y no puedo soñar 
Y es que hoy estoy triste, sólo pienso en llorar 
Si no tengo calor ni cariño junto a mí 
Sólo pienso en buscar una estrella mejor 
Que me pueda guiar 
Que alivie este dolor 
Que me lleve lejos aún más lejos de aquí 

Y ahora sólo necesito tu presencia 
Que me ausenta y no me duele y hoy te he visto 
Y hoy parece que no llueve 
Y sólo necesito que alguien crea en mí 
Que me ayude a regalar el arte, llueve 
Y hoy parece que no llueve en mí 

Mi ilusión no pasó 
Y me he dado cuenta 
De que no te tengo y siento una ausencia 
Y es que he dado tanto y aún no estas aquí 
Trato de convencerte con mi arte a cuestas 
No me canso de darte algo que a mí me llena 
Mi regalo es éste 
Ábrelo y disfruta",Llueve en Mi,2000
El Canto del Loco,"Na, na, na 

No te quiero ver más, te he dicho que 
Me dejes en paz 
Que no quedo contigo esta tarde 
Que te largues ya que no quiero más 
Que te vayas al cine 
Que vuelvas jamás a llamarme 

Na, na, na 

Si me doy la vuelta, si me voy pa´tras, si te digo 
Esto te parece mal
Si me voy, me piro, no te quiero ver más
Me voy corriendo y miro para atrás, me sigues de cerca
Quieres espiar todo lo que hago a ti te sienta mal 
Eres la persona que no quiero ya, eres esa historia 
Que quiero olvidar eres un estorbo, entérate ya 

Na, na, na 

Creo que es normal lo que te he dicho ya
Que tu cara espanta
Que te compres un mono y le cantes
No me mires mal que me das igual 
Intenta pillar lo que dicen hoy estas frases 

Na, na, na 

Eres lo peor que me pudo pasar, eres esa

Nos regala la ilusión y mi emoción

Fuerza fuera de control

Me da tanto, me llena dentro 
Me regala una canción 
Y esa fuerza que llevas dentro 
Y que es pasión 

Duermo cerca de tus sueños 
Con mi almohada sueño con ir hasta el sol 
Quiero y siento entenderte más 
Y que me quieras como soy 
Y que me entiendas más que a nadie

Por tus ojos supe que si

Imposible para el amor

Pequeñita, dónde vas pequeñita 
No me fio ni un pelo de tu carita bonita 

Vivir sin sol, imposible parar el amor

Recuerdan tu voz",Pequenita,2000

No hay canciones que llenen 
El vacío de mi soledad

De la mano y besando a ese chaval 
Poco a poco te quedaste sin lugar",Sin Mitad,2000

El Canto del Loco,"Acuerdaté 
De tus tardes de recreo 
De tus cromos y tebeos 
De las series que se hicieron para ti 
Ese erizo que era rosa 
Tú querías ser ficha roja 
Tener todas las cosas 

Acuerdaté 
Solo había dos canales 
Y unos rojos decidían 
Si veías o no veías 
Una peli que tenía 
Mil efectos especiales 
Actuaba un tal Darth Vader 
Y venían de un planeta sideral 

Tenías tanta ilusión por ser mayor 
E imitabas a tus ídolos en el salón 
Querías ser un goleador en el '82 
Ser princesa de aquel príncipe que no apareció

Recuerda bien 
Tus cabañas construidas
Querías ser una espía 
Y tu madre te decía no está bien 
Que inventes mil fantasías 
Y que vivas en tu mundo de baldosas amarillas 

Recuerda hoy 
Esa bici que querías 
La de elliot parecía 
Que nunca conseguirías para volar 
Conquistando aquella luna 
Devolviendo una fortuna 
Siendo un miembro del equipo A

Tenías tanta ilusión por ser mayor 
E imitabas a tus ídolos en el salón 
Querías ser un goleador en el '82 
Ser princesa de aquel príncipe que no apareció

Con miedo tu empiezas, con miedo tu juegas 
Con miedo a vivir, tu tienes miedo a vivir 
Ah, es una pena, y sí, tu tienes miedo a vivir 
Con miedo despiertas, cada mañana 
Con miedo tu empiezas, con miedo tu juegas 
Con miedo a vivir, tu tienes miedo a vivir 
Con miedo tu sacas todas las palabras 
Con miedo te expresas, con miedo a ser nada 
Con miedo a vivir, tu tienes miedo a vivir 
Estas enfadado con todo lo que hay cerca de tí 
Nunca te has gustado, y vives exigiendote al maximo siempre
Tu solo eres culpable de que ahora tu te veas así

Corazón, ahora tienes que pedirte perdón 
Por creerte siempre feo y culpable 
Y sufrir cada vez que sale el sol 
Corazón, corazón, ahora tienes que pedirte perdón 
Por creerte siempre feo y culpable 
Y sufrir cada vez que sale el sol 
Corazoon!

Con miedo te acuestas sin decir nada 
Con miedo tu sueñas, con miedo te entregas 
Con miedo a vivir tu tienes miedo a vivir 
Con miedo tu sacas todas tus entrañas 
Con miedo tu observas, con miedo a ser nada 
Con miedo a vivir, tu tienes miedo de tí 
Estas enfadado con todo lo que hay cerca de tí 
Nunca te has gustado, y viví es exigiéndote al maximo siempre 
Tu solo eres culpable de que ahora tu te veas así

El Canto del Loco,"Eh tu! que no tienes media luz 
Murmurar es tu inquietud 
Y luego poner la gorra
Si tu! no me gusta tu actitud 
Que vas de rollito cool 
Y juzgar es lo que toca 
La envidia es el deporte nacional 
En este puto mundo! 
Sabeis de todo y os encanta hablar 

Bla, bla, bla 
Dejame en paz, quiero seguir construyendo 
El camino de los besos que es lo que me va 
No puedo mas, teneis cero de criterio 
Llenos de resentimiento, que pena me da!

Eh tu! que hablas con exactitud 
Y no sabes ni la ""u"" 
Envidia es lo que te sobra 
Si tu! ya sois muchos en tu club 
Preguzgando sin salud, cada paso y cada cosa

El Canto del Loco,"Esta historia que te cuento es como un grito 
Una voz desesperada que grita pidiendo auxilio 
Auxilio por no ver nada que me llene en el camino 
Auxilio por ver que hay mucha falta de cariño 

Me paro y me pregunto por qué no vives 
Rodeado de mas verdad y buscando desequilibrio 
Que te llene de valor y que te quite del suicidio 
No tener que depender para sentirte mas querido 

Usando menos el coco y un poquito mas la piel 
Ya que somos lo que somos y si no lo quieres ver 
Eres tonto! 
Si no te gustas es que no estás vivo 
Eres tonto! 
Pero eso es algo que nació contigo 

Y mañana al despertar, saltar de la cama 
Luchar tu mañana, mirar a la cara 
Que no eres nada 

Eres tonto! 
Salir a la calle sin la tonteria 
Sacando de dentro entera tu vida 
Entera tu vida 

Parece que esta de moda ir de tontito 
Aparentar ser la persona que siempre tu habias querido 
¿Por qué no te quieres aunque sea solo un poquito? 
¿Por qué no eres tu mismo y no algo parecido? 

Usando menos el coco y un poquito mas la piel 
Ya que somos lo que somos y si no lo quieres ver 
Eres tonto!

El Canto del Loco,"Pasan cosas,cambian otras, ley de vida tal vez 
Todo se acaba. 
El ser humano busca un ser que le ame para 
Un segundo tramo 
Y tu quieres ser pequeño otra vez 
Yo pago coche,pago casa,pago para comer 
Todo se paga!
Y ya no hay papa, ya no hay mama 
Solo un gelocatil,de madrugada 
Si giras el cuello te ves pequeño y con 15 años 
Y duele,pero ahora estas bien!
Siempre quedara nuestro fin de semana 
Nunca dejare de querer ver vuestras caras 
Siempre quedara nuestro fin de semana 
Y llegara el domingo otra vez 
Te acuerdas tanto de esos años,de tu cuarto 
Del parque y de tu plaza 
Y de tu madre que decia abrigate que hace 
Un frio que te cagas!
Si giras el cuello te ves pequeñoy con 15 años 
Y duele,pero ahora estas bien!

Nunca dejare de querer ver vuestras caras 
Siempre quedara nuestro fin de semana 
Y llegara el domingo otra vez",Fin de Semana,2008
El Canto del Loco,"Quiero verte aquí, estar contigo y que a veces me ladres
Voy a entrar en ti, a ese sitio en que no estuvo nadie
Te voy a hacer reír con la fuerza de un beso y mi arte
Quiero ver en mí que tenerte es lo más importante

Y aunque el mundo se confunda, esto es la vida para mí
Solo quiero entrar más dentro ahora de ti

Sé, que eres el gigante que amo
La persona que me ha dado
En el centro de mi ser
Y me ha reinventado, de cosas que no había probado
Y momentos que han cambiado
Mi cerebro y mi idiotez
Y que ahora me dejan ver
Que soy como un niño

Te quiero recorrer y saber que estas de mi parte
Te quiero seducir con cada beso que te regale
Te voy a repetir que después de ti no habrá nadie
Quiero ver en mí que tenerte es lo más importante

Y aunque el mundo se confunda, esto es la vida para mí
Solo quiero entrar más dentro ahora de ti

Sé, que eres el gigante que amo
La persona que me ha dado
En el centro de mi ser
Y me ha reinventado de cosas que no había probado
Y momentos que han cambiado
Mi cerebro y mi idiotez
Y que ahora me dejan ver

La vida que hacer
Mirarte y saber
Que eres el gigante
El número diez
Mi vida por cien
La fuerza en mi ser

Quiero recorrer
Comerte y saber
Que eres mi gigante
Ese dulce placer
La vida en mi piel
Llegas a valer

Sé, que eres el gigante que amo
La persona que me ha dado,
En el centro de mi ser
Y me ha reinventado de cosas que no había probado
Y momentos que han cambiado
Mi cerebro y mi idiotez
Y que ahora me dejan ver
Que soy como un niño
Para ofrecer sin miedo y peligro
Que puedes ver
Que yo soy como un niño",Gigante,2008
El Canto del Loco,"Me acuerdo y ya hace tiempo 
Cuando un recreo era mas que un trofeo 
Cuando ser pequeño, significaba que eras el 1º 
Y recibir un premio era encontrar el mejor delantero 
Metido en aquel cromo, tan buscado era tu tesoro 

Y gracias fue tan bonito 
Por darme tanto, cuando era niño 
Y gracias lo necesito 
Lo llevo dentro y 
Vive conmigo 

Hacer daño era trampa, multiplicar un lio 
Y regalar cariño no era competitivo 
Y a las diez en casa, me dejas un ratito!
Y de escribir mil cartas todo lo hemos perdido 

Y gracias fue tan bonito 
Por darme tanto, cuando era niño 
Y gracias lo necesito 
Lo llevo dentro y 
Vive conmigo 

Un problema era tarea, y el amor felicidad 
El verano era mas largo mi refugio era mama 
Nada se quedaba dentro yo sabia perdonar 
Siempre disfrutando el tiempo siempre siendo de verdad 

Aquellos 15 años, aquellos findes que lejos estan 
Aquellas ilusiones ya no se tienen no se sienten igual 
Aquellas noches largas, aquellas plazas, y esas ganas de amar 
Mi bici amarilla (amarilla y azul) y aquel verano nunca volveran 

Y gracias fue tan bonito 
Por darme tanto, cuando era niño 
Y gracias lo necesito 
Lo llevo dentro y 
Vive conmigo",Gracias,2008
El Canto del Loco,"Hoy vuelvo a encontrar mi corazón 
Que lo tenía escondido dentro de un cajón 
Cerca del afecto y del manual de cómo hacerme un hombre 
Y lo pasé tan mal mirando alrededor 
Estando tan perdido, fuera de control
Cerca del peligro, sin equilibrio y perdiendo el norte 

Y hoy me pregunto por qué 
Me quise tan poco y me encerré 
Dando vueltas y vueltas a algo que yo creé

Y por pensar tengo un millón de cicatrices 
Soy un escudo, soy hipersensible 
Una barrera al corazón 
Y no me gusta haber estado así de triste 
Por paranoias yo me hice 
Esas heridas en mi interior

Qué gran liberación que siento hoy 
Al recorrer paquito a poco el corazón 
Que está más fuerte sabe qué quiere y ya no se esconde 
Qué grande es verme hoy sin lo anterior 
Sintiéndome tranquilo siendo lo que soy 
Inofensivo, sereno, amable y cariñoso 

Y hoy me pregunto por qué 
Me quise tan poco y me encerré

El Canto del Loco,"Miro ahora a mi alrededor 
Veo miles de vidas que no se como son 
Cada uno su historia, cada unos su rol 
Somos solo personas
Unos que viven mejor 
Porque usan el afecto como el primer valor 
Otros que andan a golpes con su corazón 
Y no cuidan su vida 

Solo quiero regalar 
Un trocito de mi verdad 
Solo quiero entregar 
Todo lo que he pasado, lo que llevo guardado en mí

Somos un trozo de vida 
La parte mas viva del gran universo 
Y tambien lo peor 
Virtud y caida 
Verdad y mentira 
Con capacidad de dar amor 
Eso es lo que quedara 

Somos un trozo de amor 
Como un saco de llanto, de risa y temor 
Somos muchas peliculas, distinto guion 
Somos solo personas
Unos que quieren ser dios 
Otros viven contentos siendo lo que son 
Otros luchan su trozo, otros lloran su horror 
Que somos solo personas 

Solo quiero regalar 
Un trocito de mi verdad 
Solo quiero entregar 
Todo lo que he pasado, lo uqe llevo guardado en mí

El Canto del Loco,"Un día llega, mira calma mi Peter Pan 
Hoy amenaza aquí hay poco que hacer 

Me siento como en otra plaza 
En la de estar solito en casa 
Será culpa de tu piel 

Será que me habré echo mayor 
Que algo nuevo ha tocado este botón 
Para que Peter se largue 

Y tal vez viva ahora mejor 
Más a gusto y mas tranquilo en mi interior 

Que campanilla te cuide y te guarde 

A veces gritas des de el cielo 
Queriendo destrozar mi calma 
Vas persiguiendo como un trueno 
Para darme ese relámpago azul 

Ahora me gritas des de el cielo 
Pero te encuentras con mi alma 
Conmigo ya no intentes nada 
Parece que el amor me calma.. me calma 

Si te vas muy bien llevate la parte que me sobra a mi 
Si te marchas viviré con la paz que necesito 
Y tanto ansié 

Mas un buen día junto a mi 
Parecía que quería quedarse aquí 
No había manera de echarle 

Si Peter no se quiere ir 
La soledad después querrá vivir en mi 
La vida tiene sus fases, sus fases 

A veces gritas des de el cielo 
Queriendo destrozar mi calma 
Vas persiguiendo como un trueno 
Para darme ese relámpago azul 

Ahora me gritas des de el cielo 
Pero te encuentras con mi alma 
Conmigo ya no intentes nada

Cuando te marches creceré 
Recorriendo tantas partes que olvide 
Y mi tiempo ya lo ves 

Tengo espacio y es el momento de crecer 

Si te machas viviré 
Con la paz que necesito y tanto ansié 

Espero que no vuelva más

Que ya tuvo bastante

No sé si pensar si merezco todo este cariño 
Que has visto en mi? que me regalas tu verdad 
Y tu cielo, que en esta vida ya no quiero otros besos 
Y cada día tú me das tu total 

Te quiero pensar quiero sentirte siempre muy cerca de mi 
Y quiero pensar que eres la suerte que me arropa del frió. 
Que has visto en mi?que me regalas tu verdad 
Y tu cielo que en esta vida ya no quiero otros besos 
Y cada dic tú me das tu total 

Y pienso que si no existes yo me muero 
Que en mi cabeza había un sueño 
Y que se a echo realidad!

Que tu vida es lo que quiero, y que tú eres mi mitad 

Me quiero morir si veo tristeza en tu sonrisa niña

Quiero otros besos, y cada día me das tu total

El Canto del Loco,"Sales a la calle, todo el mundo parece
Tan despreocupado y a nadie le apetece 
Pensar en ti 
Ahora que aprendí a cuidarme solo
No se dedicarte ni una sola palabra 
Me ha costado tanto descubrir la manera 
De no existir
Y otra vez me quema la misma historia 
Y ya lo se que no me queda a nadie 
A quien llamar 
Y no me da la gana de repetírtelo otra vez 
Esperaba que pasaras por aquí 
Y pasaste todo el año en tu glaciar 

Me parece lo peor 
Que me vuelvas a buscar 
Donde vas ahora? 
Que todo lo he perdido 
Y quiero volver a empezar
Me dejaste por vivir 
Una vida algo mejor 
No te sé reconocer 
Todo lo que tu decías que hago mal ah ah

Sales de mi casa con mirada perdida
Te sorprende tanto encontrarla vacía 
Y nada aquí 
Llegaste muy tarde a buscar tus cosas 
Vuelvo a pasear por los lugares de siempre 
Paso por las calles que están llenas de gente 
Y no estás ahí
Puede que no quiera entrarte ahora 
Y ya lo sé que no me queda a nadie 
A quien llamar 
Y no me da la gana de repetírtelo otra vez 
Esperaba que pasaras por aquí

El Canto del Loco,"Y poco a poco yo le planto cara al miedo 
Quité cobarde, por ""yo quiero, puedo hacerlo"" 
Y confiar, y salir de mí escondite así sin más 
Estar tan solo y no gustarme fué el lamento 
El lado fácil de perderme hasta el respeto 
Y yo soy más, no soy solo un comentario 
Valgo más! 

Y al despertar, la vida me regala otro color 
La vida que es igual que una cancion 
Tan llena de recuerdos y de voz 

La vida es esto a pesar de mis complejos 
Quererme a muerte y poder querer al resto 
Respirar, que me salga desde dentro y de verdad 
Que ser feliz es solo un sueño un falso invento 
Que solo existe poder serlo por momentos 
Nada más, que es la vida es lo mas grande 
Es la verdad 

Y al despertar, la vida me regala otro color 
La vida que es igual que una cancion 
Tan llena de recuerdos y de voz 
Y al caminar la vida que me enseña lo que soy 
La vida que devuelve lo que doy, 
La vida que me indica donde voy",La Vida,2008

Qué grande es verme hoy sin lo anterior

que llega a la piel y hará bien.

Y cuando nadie para un rato y mira a su alrededor,
no se deja afectar.
Y es que este mundo gira tan deprisa,
sólo se llega a pensar locura de los demás y nunca miro la mía.
Y que existe y que se que ahí está.

El Canto del Loco,"Son las 4 de la tarde
Amanece un nuevo día 
Ya no te hablas con casi nadie 
Por culpa ay de tu melancolía
Dicen que son tus colegas los que te llevan por la mala vida 
Pero es que tu eres la oveja negra 
Y tu solito te lías
Pasa a tranca y a barranca 
Sales de tu portería 
Porque últimamente ya no se te levanta 
Porque estas hecho un porquería
Porque te me apareces como los fantasmas 
Como una mala melodía
Las palabras se te atrancan si te registra la policia

Por lo menos reconoce cual es tu fuente de energia
Que siempre te imagina el mundo al revés
Una cárcel sin salida
Una manera tonta de pasar con pena y sin gloria
Pero ya a nadie le importa como acabará tu historia

Son las 12 de la noche
Comienza ya tu cacería 
Porque tu ya no te escondes por culpa 
De tus ansias de alegría
Dicen que son tus colegas los que te llevan por la mala vida
Pero es que tu eres la oveja negra 
Y tu solito te lías, 
Pasa a tranca y a barranca 
Sales de tu portería 
Porque últimamente ya no se te levanta

El Cartel,"Hey, wir sind nicht Ali oder Ahmet,
Betrachtet das Schachbrett
Wer uns missachtet ist jetzt im Zugzwang
Ihr machtet uns mit eurem betrug lang genug krank
Betonköpfe verschwinden vom winde verweht wie Flugsand

Gozunu 4 ac ve kulak ver bana
98 cartel direk gelir sana
Maffayla kaynastik ne oyle yanyana
Biktim usandim kibrit gibi yanmaya
Ceviz bo$ kaldi sele gitti nefretin
Haksizlikla yolsuzlukla doldu tasti defterin
Devletin sag kolumusun ulan zuhtu
Insanlara karsi hakaretlerin sadece puftu
Dar kafaligin sonucu elbette meskenet
Dunyanin her yeri sana bana memleket
5 milyar yolcu baraber ayni gemide
Kara toprak bekliyor senide benide

Iste cartel maffay la beraber

Sevgi tarlasina etnik tohumlar ektik
Sonucta estetik fotograflar cektik
Cartel maffay iste kulturlerin birleSimi
Dik kafalar ogrenemez kafa yoran bilir isi
Bilir kisi acemi acaba kim yener
Orumcek beyinliler karanlikta gezer
Aydinin elinde her sefer fener
Sener sen gibi sen olup birazcikta gulelim
3 gunluk dunyada neden uzup uzulelim
Su gibi suzulelim cuval gibi buzulelim
Dargin suratlar nefretin kac paralik
Gerceklere gozunu yumanlarin sonu karanlik
Susarak kime yarandik bu parca size
Karanliga biraz isik tuttuysak ne mutlu bize
Gok ne sinir tanir ne vize
Onu bunu birakinda gelin artik kendinize

Sinirli ufuklara gozu goren korlere
Yaßamayi unutup olen amatorlere
Tek yon cemberinde dolasip donen Soforlere
Paydos ulan uyan 2000e 5 kala
Yola ciktik yoreselden ulusala
Ulusaldan evrensele atliyoruz daldan dala
Agac gibi tur tur yasamak tek ve hur
Orman gibi kardescesine bir omur
Komur basinami vurdu
Senindi benimdi derken unuttuk cihani yurdu
Barisi sulhu imdat ulan orman yaniyor
Kizilirmaktan kizil gonlum kaniyor
Kim geliyor kim kaliyor
Hangi at gozluklu esek kalacagini saniyor
Bizi bizden iyi taniyor gok ve deniz
Birde kara toprak naber lan keriz, naber lan keriz?
