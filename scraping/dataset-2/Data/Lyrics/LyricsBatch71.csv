True. he did do her just like daddy did. with
Deception in his pocket. he sold her. I'm the victim

Got political power. you disgraced her memory one last

Coalesce,"Glance to break you away from her. A bond you
Sanctioned by sound and honored with a lack of
Penetration. Eating Daisies and licking roses, the
Bitter fruits of bickering politicians. And there he
Stood a model of perfection. Careless and fit with
Contempt for me. Could you predict this before you.
Did you fall to your knees in guilt. Could you fake a
Single tear to tide over his want of righteousness.
What would it take? Time to sort out your mind still
Crippled by deviance? Take it off and show yourself. I
Touch not out of want or need. I haven't the taste for
Bitterness. I touch nothing for it's all you are.
There's that thought again. There's no one here but
You and me. No one needs to know a thing. It's a done
Deal, I'll slip in. What happens on the road. Will
Stay on the road. Don't think less of me, I'm just a
Man with needs. I won't tell you twice to get out of
My head and stay awake behind locked doors. And there
She stood a model of temptation. Again, wet and
Willing with no faith in me. Still I passed your

",I Am Not the First,1997
Coalesce,"I never considered that. I chose to stay numb over
Tears. I forgot myself to keep momentum. I took a year
And stretched it ten fold. But today I live, I live it
Down. With both eyes just now reawakening. Still soar
And sober. Still sober for no reason. I have every
Reason. I can be just as addictive as the next so take
Care of me. I am your responsibility. You wanted to
Change it all so start with an infant. Is this it?
Have you given it to me? Is this the meaning? Have you
Forced it upon me or am I hanging myself needlessly?
Damn your riddles stop speaking in tongues. Let me
Hear t, let me feel it across my face if need be.
You've given it all still I want even more. Sober
Expression. Numb in motive. Take even more. Damn your
Riddles. They change nothing. I will stand back and
Take it all in. I am still myself. I'm still intact.
Just let me rest. Just let me rest. Just let me go.
Yesterday I was left just like before and again every
Night after. Now I can accept the common them in
Unconsciousness. Temptation's only a word now with no

Coalesce,"She's got one foot on the ground. That's one more than

Something for your presence is coming chilly. Your
Motions sadly sober now. Please let yourself cry.
Prove your miserable existence and I'll believe. I'll
Confess my sin. Choking on the manipulation of
Another. Roaming on the plane of no bother. The child

Bother us now. You knew everything except the price of
Haste, so hold your breath to hold his hand. I'm here
So where are you? Everything was lost overhead. Above
The mantle in the depression. Not a single memory to
Burn in this betrayal. At least nothing that I can
Reach. I am still standing, still staring at your
Child rolling, playing in your husband's stain. Would
You make a token for your son of what's left of his

Search for him. I am here so where are you. I am still
Here and I need you.",One on the Ground,1997
Coalesce,"Nothing ever came so easy as the manipulation of her
word. Cold and humiliated, I tried to portray this
mess. I should fear it. I should give it all to them
and be done with it. I fear he maybe found a use. A
meaning or comprehension. Some sort of new birth or
late coming death. Who's eyes will govern this
judgment? It's just not my place to judge who tried or
to condemn who cried. I want to be her. I want all of
the answers. A crusty and scratchy mess shielded only
by burlap and the satisfaction of knowing. But I know
nothing. I am the impostor. The fake bastard holding
on to dreams. I want all the answers. I won't wince at
each neck's snap nor help at the hint of hope, I'll
just lie here wet and willing to provoke you. Still no
closure. Cold is so damn trite and evil was never
glamorous. Still it sells so fucking buy it as
politics mean nothing now. As it's already in their
heads. In their hands it resides a mark. So I leave
mine as well to finally be picked apart. Dissected and
forgotten. Ignored at best. But it's still a mark. She

Still take you with a grain of salt I could fake some
Respect and hide the pity. 
For what I once feared is now somehow down on my level. 

I never claimed to see through another's eyes. 
I could never inflict such abuse upon myself honestly.

Ringing in my head. 

Selfishly sober in spite of you.
I'll never be the man to which you compare me.
Selfishly sober in spite of them. 
You boast I'm dead to you and I in turn agree. 

I turned a deaf ear on you, I knew the rest. 
Sob stories were never my strong suit. 
Now just as threatening as I'll let you be. 
I keep a short rope, and a shorter fuse. 

For the one who love's who?

Then I am finally home

That never moved me a single inch

If common sense and common decency aren't enough
Then leave me behind and consider yourself weeded out
If you have the taste for guilt and feed on lies
Then leave me behind and consider me sold out

And this sell out will keep screaming
With the voice to push you to violence

Every blow proof that you have no intentions of equality

That maybe I can't roll with these punches. I don't
Want to be that man. Independence is all me have but
That's now becoming a joke by your actions. I don't
Want to be that man who let it all go and found out
How sweet revenge really is. So sweet it consumed me
And pushed me toward crime. Oh, only if you put in the
Hours I have to make this work. Put in the time I
Think you want me to beg for what I work so hard for.

Everyone to be content and safe. I won't be that man.",Measured in Gray,1998
Coalesce,"Farewell friend until tomorrow. Where you are still
Nitpicking our diets and names. The potential is still

Courage if you show me responsibility. Something lost
Long ago in trying to please everyone. In pleasing
Ourselves. If it feels good it must be right. Right?
So what's a child? A fetus or kink in sexual
Revolution and what am I? A threat, a kink in
Political consistency. More name games and more
Personal choice. So where's mine? Or are you to deal
Me such luxuries. Call me what I am and mean every
Word. Be prepared to take yours. You see you're not
Along. I'll show you responsibility if you show me

along the way have been lost to this. I know you can't
afford to be wrong. And we can't either. We want it
back. I can't afford to lose you. But that's not what
this is about. If love ever had a second name it's
attachment. And if you had an ounce of common sense
you would be witness to this. but try your best not to
be of this world. Fly with the rest of your glassy
eyed angels. Straight to heaven gate and don't forget
your spare change to horde and render useless. Gold
was always more valuable than bread in the stomachs of
the starving. And you dare say I'm godless (filthy)
less evolved, sure to be stuck in my rut. Well I say
you're gutless. The first in line to be our rip off
artist. The first to change your name to push more
product. We finally got it back from the clutches of
absurdity. And our bond is measured by nothing. No
books, no rounds, no quotas, and certainly not by how
many units sold. I tell you krishna's dead to me along
with my love for extremes. I tell you krishna's dead!

no hope. Dead is dead.",On Being a Bastard,1998

Cocaine 80s,"Thousand lives ago
We were young and we didn't know
We were trading our crowns for our souls
Made the sacrifice
Headed back to the light
But be careful don't drown in the gold
I know it glows but it's cold

I'm from the other side of town
Out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share or how to care
I never had no teachings about being fair

Have you ever heard of Black Stone around Black Stones?
And Four C H'd, Vice Lords, Stony Island on Aces
The concrete matrix, street organizations
They gave violations, hood public relations
It was the basics to get big faces
Stay away from cases, bad broads, good graces
The hustles was the taste makers and trend setters
They the ones that fed us hopin' that the feds don't get us
The era of Reagan, the terror of Bush
Crack babies, momma's a push, we were the products of Bush
I'm wishin' for a Samurai Suzuki and a little Gucci
A bad ho to BBB do me, you heard of flukey?
Stokes it was folks and coke and dope
Fiends choked off of smoke, herringbones and rope
Rare jewels of a generation
Diamonds, blind enough so real shit we facin'
Forties wasted on seats, Dion makin' the beats
When they air it out on at the parties we escapin' the heat
I could break it down like whatever you need
He squinted his face and rolled the weed

You know they don't see sometimes
That in the neighborhood
It's the exact same thing
It's the same thing over and over again
Feel me?

Have you ever heard of no limit, three hundred, six hundred?
Folly boy, O block, east side
Where it ain't no conversation they just let them heats ride
Can't nobody stop the violence, why my city keep lyin'?
Niggas throw up peace signs but everybody keep dying
Used to post up on that strip, I look like a street sign
I've been out there three days and I got shot at three times
Felt like every bullet hit me when they flew out each nine
I be happy when I wake up and I have a free mind
I know haters wanna clap me up, watch the morgue grab me up
But they can catch me later, I been cool, chasin' paper
Where I come from ain't no hope if you was claimin' that was major
Small crib, big fam, mom was workin', granny raised us
No food in the refrigerator, I was bangin', pullin' capers, that's real shit
Same niggas from day one boy, yeah I'm still with
Better watch out for that jump shot cause they will hit
Hungry take your shorty lunchbox, and won't feel shit
I came from a place where it's basic but you won't make it
Feds buildin' cases, judges who racist and full of hatred I mean

I can withstand most anything

Born with teeth

Out of the womb into an ugly world I've been thrown
Welcome to the race
Up on two legs before it tumbles on me
I'm not looking for a kind work to keep me going
It' so much better off this way
To be born with teeth

After all that I've seen taken place
Very little has affect
I've been treated like I should have been
At least that's what my mind says
I'll be around when everyone has been satisfied or overcome
It's possible even my happiness will stumbled on

Out of the womb into an ugly world I've been thrown
Welcome to the race
Up on two legs before it tumbles on me
I'm not looking for a kind work to keep me going
It' so much better off this way
To be born with teeth

I can get along
I get along without to much advise
Ahh, but if it weren't so hard to make things right
It's gonna be whatever fate will bring
I've managed to look good so far
But there's no use pretending

Out of the womb into an ugly world I've been thrown

Take this coward's courage, nothing can stop 

Always the unexpected that you can't see 
That will come at you from behind

People do what they like, that much is sobering 
But nothing less than a miracle could answer to all my pleas 
Hope for my wish, the waves of a parting sea 
I could use a little thunder 
And lightning from the sky 
So should I leave these precious dreams 
Will not die 

How to live by the rules when I've read this book before 
There's no courage to prove, just your reasoning 
Faces of forgotten men much too afraid to ask 
Like cogs in a wheel, we long to keep turning back 
I've got to keep from going under 
While running for my life 
So should I leave these precious dreams 
Will not die 

After years of uncertainty I wait for the final round 
Losing my place, you call me to calm you down 
I could use a little thunder 
And in someone to confide 
So should I leave these precious dreams 
Will not die 
A little thunder and lightning 
So when I leave these precious dreams

For honeymoons each sleepless night

A sign on the wall made it perfectly clear, no guns, no bombs, no knives in here

Potsdam rocks but we should have been told of freedoms new and rivals old
We played the set and we encored fast, then the dressing room door was locked at last
In retrospect, the mistake was the fact that the sign didn't say: no baseball bats

Bats out, get your bats out

There's always dark before the dawn, there's always still before the storm
From calm to chaos in a flash, the bottles flew, the place got trashed
Then, through the noise, we heard the shout: get your bats out, get your bats out

Bats out, get your bats out

Said the manager to the security guard,
""It's no use standing there looking hard..
Pick up the bat and follow me,""
He said ""I'm not with security!""

And the ballroom now was a battlefield and we thought that someone might get killed

What went wrong
I get the feeling that somebody's got it in for us all the way
And we've been called names that were not justified
And we never had the right to reply
Telling lies

Somebody somewhere must care
Hello hello is anybody there
Who'll lend us an ear

It's just amazing how little people know about us
Not a thing
But rumors carry more weight than facts
And they only contribute to the fact
That we take

Never mind the bollocks the truth is plain to see
If only people took the time to come and talk to me

To black or white
And step on it

Between the word and sign
Between the man and all his time
Between the sidewalk and the moving stairway
Between the yay and nay !

There falls the thruth we do so righteous flay

And step on it

Until we cool the heat
Until we share our cup of meat
Until the trail of waste is put to stud
Until we drift away

Cockney Rebel,"I was a drifter in a rock 'n' roll safari
Took a fancy to an ape in malawi
Who kissed my head and my eyes went all starry
And so I ran and was screaming ""where the hell are we ? ""

He begged : ""don't go, don't cry !""

There was a tiger I fought for the glory
The bloody battle was fierce and was gawry
Was like a scene from a kipling story
He sucked my blood like he's eating tandoori

He yelled: ""don't go, don't cry !""

I took a plane and was greeted in england
By many people and my spine started tingling
They stole my time and they all started mingling
I ran so hard that my feet started stinging

Only here to be borrowed or hired

Old enough to hold a gun

Pistols not so long ago
Many times I reminisce
About this solitude and bliss
We enjoyed as children
O did we really have to grow ?

She came to me soft, asunder
Showed me the distant thunder blue
Told me the clouds could help us all
Told me the prophet says the man is deep in you

Begged her never tell then wept

Only lend you a clue....

Cockney Rebel,"As the sun was coming up on the danube, the hotel room was alive
It's heart was beating hard as thunder, there were three of us
There for the night
And we were talking about the magnificent river of strauss
We were saying that nothing is sacred, it's everything else
We put a match to a candle and watched it flicker and spark
We just stared at ourselves until we couldn't keep our tired
Eyelids apart
Then someone (I think it was me) said: ""somehow this is rich,
""we're sitting here on thr danube and nobody noticed the
Blue water bitch""

Ohh la la, it's fun to be so kitsch

We went out to the balcony, the danube a glorius flame
We tookpolaroid pictures and swore that we're never again going
To be the same
It was a moment when nothing was stirring save these two and me
And the clouds were beginning to gather and crash overhead from
The glorius sea

We swayed to and fro and talked of michaelangelo
And of how there was too much beauty here to take it in one go
Then from a corner a tap on the door put the room in a flood
There was God in my mind but the problem was water - not blood !

Ohh la la , it's fun to drink of blood

They ran around me, demented, white lightning flashed in their heads
I was getting bewildered, put on my armour, I was scared of
Attack from the reds
And with a pound lodged in mu nose I felt kind of rich and serene
I yelled: "" lenny, come quick, get the other boy, take him out
Of this scene !""

When he disappeared, there was only lenny and me
And we hit on a thousand subjects at once in spite of the dusky
Beat
Then lenny opened his eye for a second and pulled down the blind
Saying: ""go if you must but you know you'll always be easy
To find""

Ohh la la, it's fun to make it blind

We heard phaedre speak of the philistines of paris
But she talked to herself like a parasite so we both struggled
Free
I said: ""zizi jeanmaire wouldn't take this and neither will we
""if they call me napoleon again I'll be forced to let the lion
Free

""I'll tear down all the paper walls they hide behind
""I'll be damned if I'll take much more of this, I'm beginning
To see the signs""
Then I glanced at lenny and saw that my confidante was beginning
To jest
Well, he came out of my subconscious and that's where I put him
Away to rest

Ohh la la, it's so fun to be depressed

I can't get over my beginnings, I can't imagine my end
I want to escape this wilderness I'm living in, I want to be
Somebody's friend
I could do with a little peace, o lord, and my heart cries out
For love
But to realise all of one's fantasies hasgot to be too much
",Nothing is Sacred,1976
Cockney Rebel,"I should say by the way that you're acting today

Crowned you the truth of my youth
But you give me the line in the words of our time

Cockney Rebel,"Pop paper people printing ""rebel insane""
They in my head and digging into my brain
I need umbrella to keep out the rain
I can't hope to keep the pace I have made
Maybe I'll settle in the country and fade

It's all too much for me to handle with ease
I'm sinking fast- I'll soon be down on my knees
Dreams of loretta and lorraine and louise
I can't hope to be the ""devil-may-care""
Maybe I'll settle with you all in my hair

Broke three fingers last night
Ain't got the energy to fight
They tell me everyfhing's gonna be all right
I can't dope to do more than my best
It's so easy. this is really no test!

Cockney Rebel,"Gee, but it's hard when one lowers one's guard to the vultures 
Now me I regard it's a torturous hardship that smolders
Like a peppermint eaten away

See her tumbling down, tumbling down

Hail to the monkey, we're having a funky reunion
Wasted and sunk, he can only have Sunday communion
He got nicotine stains in his eyes
He got nothing to protect but his pride
Oh! smother the kiss or be drownded in blissful confusion 
See it tumbling down, tumbling down

Juvenile tale, see the Tintanic sail into Brighton
The Hemingway stacatto, the tragic bravado can frighten
To be here, there and everywhere's fine
But do you have to be so swift all the time
Deliver the dawn to the Moulin-Rouge on the horizon 
Watch it tumbling down, tumbling down
Tumbling down, tumbling down

When she asked me would I like to wait and to see?
Would I like to try and explain?
Would I like to try and explain?
How my heart is feeling tonight with all the strain?
And I said I could take much more from such a friend
Although I hoped we weren't very far away from the end
For the time it's a-getting late,
Yeah, the time it's a-getting late
And my heart is hurting a little bit from the weight

She just said:
""I've got a bed here for you
I've got a bed here for me
So you can look into my eyes
And tell me what you see . . .'

She's like a rosebud in my heart and in my dreams
See her flow into the night like rivers and streams
How I'd love to lie in her arms
How I'd love to lie in her arms

And the honey-coloured moon was bouncing around

Outside a stockholm cafe at the river's edge we sat and smiled
We said how rich we were and how warm we felt with a cognac heart
Talked over women in a lonely voice and began to jive

Was in a scene from ""death in the afternoon"" when I almost cried
I realized papa wanted me to live in his bull ring life
It made me hungry for peace and it made me wild and tore my heart
It didn't help to wipe away the fears like he often claimed

All the men are hungry, all the men are in search of time

Was in a frenzy from the midnight air when I saw the light
I realized only children can live upon a timeless flight
It made me hungry for youth and it made me sad and made me laugh

Trying to stick her cosmic philosopher's 
Words into rhymes 
Nobody can tell it the same 
To her evcrything's just like a game 
But she'll make it seem some big machine's 
Driving you clean outa your mind 
Come on admit it, that's just the limit, 
We've travelled from mad to sublime 

Chorus: 
Oh she's a lady from a background of pearls 
Who's tormenting and bending my world 
My only vice is the fantastic prices I 
Charge for being eaten alive. . . 

So Nina can paint dragons on guitars 
She can roll up a Victorian vase, 
That gal can sweep, skip, 
Jump and leap into a room full of clowns, 
No one'll tame her, no one'll claim her, 
'til she's been at least all around 
Doreen is a hunk of a man, 
She can wipe every boy from the land 
But Lorraine can fly it way outa sight 
Then bring it on back to the fold 
Give me a chance, I want romance, 
Don't give me your love quite so cold

When we were yong, such smashing days
We'd pass the time in such pleasant ways
Happy just to be iiving-oh yeah!
Too many summers controlled our heads
Too many memories - so many dead
We fall behind but we also lead them
Listened all the time to a singular band

Put our resources into one appollo
We only had to watch and follow
Then swoop around like a possessed swallow
Thinking only of winning ¨c oh yeah!
And all the iime defending ourselves
Brushed aside all the tempting sea-shells
Charging-up like battery cells
Looking all the time for a singular band

You and me getting everywhere now
On the land and in the air now
Got no worries of getting there now

And now we have lots of pretty clothes
Many friends and many foes
Looking wonderful but heaven knows
Who will want us now we're turning into singular band

Hit the throttle 
We'll do the rhumba too and say the life we knew 
Was so gay 

Ah, teach me to rock, I'm getting caught in a pocket 
Of Saki 
We can go to a hop and do Suburban Bop 
Cool and sharply 
Queue for the cops, you got no reason to not 
Be Malaki 
Your Gossamer and Fluff are gonna be enough 
For today

On the borders 
We'll dig the hustle-around and hear the Virgin sound

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

E vi abbandono, fisso il Sole solo
Volo nel cielo, sotto vedo il suolo
Per la famiglia gli estranei chi sono?
Vi racconto di me, voi chi siete?
Mi riconoscete, forse vi perdono
Passo la notte in studio giù da CoCo
Ho quattro angeli, forse uno buono
Cosa vuoi dalla vita?
Cosa vogliono queste persone?
Sanno cos'è la tensione, il dolore, l'amore?
A scuola filone
Poi quattro calci al pallone
Botte col tipo buffone
Lo chiamano palo, non perché accende il lampione
Arriva se arrivano i droni
Freddato, bacialo se muore

Mi dedicherai una canzone""

Spesso ho invidiato i miei amici

Sei di noi in due in motorini
Tute Diadora, strade a memoria
Canne di due pacchettini
La mia prima storia, cene a McDonald
Quanto eravamo aggressivi

Pomeriggi da me
A nasconderti dai miei
Insieme fino alle 6
Farlo senza far rumore
Poi scappare prima che
Tuo padre bussi al portone
E poi ad un tratto mi sono svegliato
Guardato intorno e tutto quanto era così cambiato
Crescere non era come l'avevo immaginato
Tu metti apposto cose che non so più dove stavano

Introduce a drug called crack to us ghetto teens

When will niggas see they got us bleedin' with three strikes
Can't seem to focus hopeless, with violent thoughts I wrote this
Got these Devils petrified, hidin' from my hocus-pocus
And so I learned to earn my currency and over time
Affiliated, clearly click a military mind
May God forgive us though we dwell inside a paradox
Thugged out and drug dealin', from the womb to the block

My forty-five got me fortified with live rounds

Never forget the method, stick and move strictly
Shit be seemin' like it's closin' in
With no regrets I hold position
Cause I suppose I'm one of the chosen men

Picture being put in a position to move
And you can't move cause your move is blocked by the knight
At twelve o'clock, that's when the madness begins
So I start to focus in, my thoughts on the war
Cause the rule is the law, and the law that we live by
Is to stay true to self, in this case, BDI
Why try if ya body lie
By the block true soldier mentality, this is how we rock and roll

Stick and move, time to show 'em how to make a move
Or get moved on, let's see who strong

In the gaze of the strange, where nothin stays the same
Where new faces come through with similar game
Now who you thought was them, really ain't
They catchin' deja vu's of the game people play
It's a call for readjustment, fine tune yo' position
You slippin' and trippin' 'stead of bobbin and dippin'
But never let this world of stress get the best of me
Takin' breathin' techniques, slay you with Tai-Chi

What does it take, to get a break in the world of snakes
And dose who fake
Elimination I'm facin' destruction
Outlawed, so I duck and down, fo'-fo' is bustin', no one to trust in
Rushin' to the goal line
Catch a nigga beat him treat him like he stole mine
No swine I'm a soldier, soldier I control mine
Time to, take you, back into time - follow dis here

One way out, this black hole
For this black soul, shit is outta control
I'm fightin' for my position to be a fetus in this world I'm enterin'
And my face is sentencin' for repentance
Before my body was fully formed into a human
I was already consumin' weed
Cause my moms used to smoke back in the 70's
Maybe that's why in the 90's I drop G's when I drop degrees
When I ease across the block with 'Pac

Slide the nail under the top and bottom buttons of my blazer
Relax the fraying wool, slacken ties
And I'm not to look at you in the shoe, but the eyes, find the eyes

Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow me, leave this academic factory
You will find me in the matinee
The dark of the matinee
It's better in the matinee
The dark of the matinee is mine
Yes it's mine

I time every journey to bump into you, accidentally
I charm you and tell you of the boys I hate
All the girls I hate
All the words I hate
All the clothes I hate
How I'll never be anything I hate
You smile, mention something that you like
How you'd have a happy life if you did the things you like

Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow me, leave this academic factory
You will find me in the matinee
The dark of the matinee
It's better in the matinee
The dark of the matinee is mine
Yes it's mine

So I'm on BBC2 now, telling Terry Wogan how I made it and
What I made is unclear, but his deference is and his laughter is
My words and smile are so easy now
Yes, It's easy now
Yes, It's easy now

Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow me, leave this academic factory
You will find me in the matinee

With reverence I enter into this holy place
A home that's like no other full of mercy, love and grace
I know it's been a long time, I've never felt that far
'Cause You were always on my mind, and You were always in my heart

It's so good to be home, where I know that I belong
Inside this house of love, with a family so strong
And I'm here to worship and pour out my offering
In the presence of His love, I'm never alone

It's so good to be (home, home) home (home, sweet home)

Coco Jones,"They say I'm young but my purpose is
The inspiration of a nation innovation
Til I change the talk into a conversation
I'm like a doctor and my patients are anxiously
Waiting healing all the hating
That's faking in the paper chasing
Its hard to live up to these expectations
That I'm facing and gain the admiration
Of an older generation
That's why I'm pacing back and forth
Contemplating, meditating how to use what I've been taught
As a positive force

Oh this is who I am
I wish you'd understand
Its time to set me free

No no matter what I do
I'm still apart of you
I hope you'll always be
My Guardian Angel

I wanna be the greatest in the world
Not for the money,or the fame,or the girls
Not for the car keys,jet skis,or the vacation to the West Indies
But simply 'cause love it
When I write I'm like a puppeteer
Pulling my strings til the melody sings
And it honestly makes me spread my wings
You calling me out
Without your mind
Send that thought back down your spine
I'm on the ground
It's on the line
Road signs say both ways at the same time
Most days I can't wait to rhyme
Express my stress elevate and shine
Progress,regress
Each step's climbed
So I take that test and I testify

'Cause my intentions were good
If you can only see that poetry can hide in the hood
The passion in Philosophy of possibilities
Every dream is in my reach
I'll find my freedom in this beat
Follow me now it's a brand new ground
Swallow your pride I'll make you proud
All of my life I've lived out loud
We just preached to different crowds

Was for another guy

Then I knew my lyrics were the key to see the other side
I should have told you but I never had the courage
And I thought you really wouldn't understand (No)
And now I'm out here just to let my feelings surface

And Kris was all this and that
And my look didn't really fit the rap, it didn't match

So I locked up my feelings in the words he said
Give me a hand and I'll take off my mask

The joint was a jumpin' on the corner
(Yeah, yeah)
Down on a Honky Tonk Street
(Yeah, yeah)
When all of a sudden up drove a Cadillac
(Yeah, yeah)
And out stepped a cat named Pete

Diamonds on-a every finger
(Yeah, yeah)
Wore a tailor-made suit
He smoked a black cigar
(So what?)
He wore a Stetson hat
(Yeah)
He wore a pair-a cowboy boots

He busted on through the doorway
(Yeah, yeah)
Bad as-a he could be
(Yeah, yeah)
He pulled out his pistol, he turned around
He said, 'My name is a Big Boy Pete'

The music stopped, there wasn't a sound
A-over in the corner stood-a, Bad Man Brown
Brown smiled a grin, he said, ""My friend""
(You take your 3 steps forward and I'm 'onna-a, clue you in')

Now Pete said, ""A look it, here buddy""
(Yeah, yeah)
'Fore I tan your hide
(Yeah, yeah)
I got a forty-five to keep me alive
Seven bullets on my side

Brown pulled a knife, he jumped on Pete
They fought from the counter right on out to the street
They swung from north, they swung from south
Brown cut that black cigar right outta Pete's mouth!
Pete hit the ground, he yelled and screamed
(Pete took his Stetson hat and beat the scene)

Now if you're ever down on the corner
(Yeah, yeah)
Down on-a Honky Tonk Street
(Yeah, yeah)
Don't mess with Brown
(Yeah, yeah)
He'll cut you down
Take a message from-a Big Boy Pete

Hurt so bad and fellas I ain't lyin'
Eyes wide open, girl robbed me blind

Robbed me hard, didn't cut me no slack

And park it right by her door

With her arms open wide

But in the meantime, I remain streamlines
Back in my ends if ever my money decline
I double my wins, now look how my whole team shine
Hell no, blow out my dough, I'm tryna keep mine
Nigga, fuck that snow up your nose, it's fuckin' ski time
Ho-ho, call up the hoes, it's shoppin' spree time

Coco Schumann,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,1997
Coco Schumann,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Coco Schumann,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,1997
Coco Schumann,"Day by day I'm falling more in love with you
And day by day my love seems to grow
There isn't any end to my devotion
It's deeper dear by far than any ocean

I find that day by day you're making all my dreams come true
So come what may I want you to know
I'm yours alone, and I'm in love to stay
As we go through the years day by day",Day by Day,1999
Coco Schumann,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,1999
Coco Schumann,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere

I've got so much honey the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees

Hey hey hey

Want to be like, roll the trees like us
Want to talk like want to walk like us
Want to flip like get ripped like us
Want to act like know you're black like us
Want to flip like kick shit like us
Want to bust like you ain't rough like us
Tek and Steele, Won on Won, Smoky Guns, what?

Ding! That's the sound of the bell
""Oh shit!"" is all you heard before you fell
To the canvas, all washed up like my dirty drawers
And pants get, try to challenge get damaged
Plain and simple, with bandages around your temple
Easily erased out the picture like pencil
Peeped me once, saw me again got your pistol
I put permanent fear in your heart like a dimple

Son hold my A.V. let me rock this no-body
Comin' out the closet tryin' to stop my money?
Actin' like you're sweet cause he ain't see me in the streets
Spit that blood out and get back up on your feet
You called me I was there on some Candyman shit
Wear that ass out in front your kids and your bitch
Hurt you to the boards, put the ten to your jaw
Walk away, parley in front of Achmed's store

We don't give a WHAT about you, tell them niggas who sent you
Let em come, have em all open wide like dentals
Heard they work for cheap, think I might rent you
If you feel I disrespected you, good, I meant to
Nigga I'd wish you'd, talk about runnin' for guns
Get your Bankhead Bounce like insufficient funds
Left ass-out a home beggin' like bums
Cut off, swept off the floor like crumbs

I'm from N.Y.C.I.T.Y. stay high
Lazy eye ghetto celeb rap guy from Bed-Stuy
Splash in two lines, me no long rhymes
Losing your attention taking up your time
I gets mine and breathe, bout it bout it like P
Too many wannabe me, want to flow blow hold dough
Like Smoky (Smoky Lah), fly across seas
Blow shows for B.C.C. (knock you out), but you can't be
You heard me, you soft like porridge
You ain't gettin' money and you have no courage
(Aye yo son, let me at they ass son)

Introducing, the one who gets you bugged like a Lucie
Same height, same weight, same fight skills like Bruce Lee
Try me, ready for those who want to harm me
Don't toy with me, you want to be all you can be, join the Army
I swarm like bees plus sting too, bring grooves
I blow em out like hankies (hachoo!) nab you like cops do

For the longest I've been waitin', to take it to these Jafaicans
Corner eyeballin' on the moves that we was makin'
Thinkin' that we lost it cause our line was closed
Can't stop a hungry nigga with nothin' to live foe
I'ma see that dough, many hustlers I know
Three car longshark white chalk and celo

Yo, I think I'll take this time to remind you
Not to sit by the line, test mine, Crime Stoppers won't find you
Before we come kickin' your door to the floor
Throw you to the wall, making you our prisoner of war
Cut you too short to take walks with Tattoo
Attack you from your front open you back with my scalpel
Snatch two, niggas from the crew if they got
Anything to do with motherfuckers coming back to avenge you
I intend to, get down for my temple
Keep a strong mental when dealin' with evils that men do
Them who, fail to comprehend I
Recommend you remember you're dealin' with men who'll
Send you, off in a coffin
Cause far too often niggas are gettin' lost and it's costin'
Body parts, from anybody that starts
We play the hackers, takin' rappers apart

Ya only reach for your hip when your two ways go off
Shots'll fly by your head
Your toup blow off
I ain't crip I'm just a blue gray show off
Ghetto fab I more than rap for my bucks
Keep two 9's on me like Warren Sapp from the Buccs
The word I'm ballin' be flowin' to the fed Jakes
And I keep chicks on my lap throwin' me head fakes

Refuse to lose
But sometimes the flesh get's weak
And I regret the decision I choose

But I'm not trying to sing the blues
'cause life goes on, remembering the verse Nitty showed me the song
Kept me calm for a minute though
Got me mellowin' Juda blaze the Cocoa

But in the back of my mind I still know
I still got a job to do, for real yo
Give thanks for the meal, it's time to peel though
Lick 'em off, soon be back to bill yo

On the bricks side where it's real for sho
But what's really buried deep in the mind, no one knows

It's a struggle but the mo, I smoke the mo my mind flow

Losin' my mind, tryin' to stay high everybody fuckin' wit me
'cause they know I keep a pound of trees 'cause I gotta maintain in me

It's the life of my man who lived for the root of all evil
I can't knock him though, 'cause we was once consider peoples
We broke bread at the same chicks crib, two ribs
We just roughed up gums, we just brushed up

Dump him for the love of money, by the root of O.J.'s
'Bout it to half smoke Philly comin' out the ash tray

I didn't even know, just knew my man, Mr. Brown
And I've been linkin' up with dunn for 3 months now
Looked at my kiko asked him, which body cocked thee
Returned to death stair, eye's full of blood shot

Try to block it wit a chuckel, hit that shit nigga, fuck you
Fuck him, pull my coat, just hop up on the dust too
Like it's cool to be smokin' on the rulers
Don't hit the spliff, less until you twist the Buddhas

That's a muthafuckin' friend I don't need

It's a shame, it's a shame, how you blamed your man
For some shit that you been through, but you don't understand
It's a price to pay, the price when you play the game
If you get up in the game, get hit up in the game

I seen niggas snitch just to come home quick
Money came home, but he got hit
In the bubble whip, with the system in it
One shot, fire two, then burst shit that's what happen when you thrust

You really thought you had the throne, 'cause you was the bone

Should I say chill 'cause there ain't no rest for me yet
Shit, I can't say chill .cause the property's hot
Got to get it while the gettin' could be got or get not
'Cause of those who cop block, or those who get not
Spillin' beans like a cook to them crooked ass cops
To all my G's don't snooze
'Cause they crews in blues and whites
Comin' to the PJ's lookin' for fights
Mr. Officer cool down your temper
Me just cool you n'alf to come like no murderer
I try to do my thing, and you try to take me in
Have me stressed with a bunch of dope fiends in the pen
Then again
That's the place where you see the same face in thew street
Everybody got to charge the beat

Home where the grass is greenah
And all the gods and earths choose a court in Medina

The place where I received my roots
Got put on to this loot
And got my first Tim boots

See me in the G-S-T-0-0
On the side of the road
Gettin' harassed by po-po's
Bucktown
Home of my be	-see-see
And everybody that I roll with, the family

Boot Camp's the way of life for a loner like me
Constantly holdin' courts in the street with police
Like the sergeant 81st, pretty boy is what they call 'em
Said he was a gun man, duke is kinda brawlic
Speaks with an accent, ????? I would imagine
A hot-headed dred known for jumping into action
We danced a few times
He got his, I got mine
Called the whole force up to pat us down for the crime
Said it's all about a quarter and his veins bleed blue
Your man Rudey, Juliani fucked it up for you
Ain't gonna be no dice throwin'
Dead that weed blowin'
Domestic violence, automatic fire, he ain't jokin'
Now you first offenders are gettin' hit like predicates
Goin' through the system just for standin' on the strip
Gotta keep an open eye when it's time to cop la
From dirty ass deeds and unmarks ridin' by

(Chorus)

Home of the Originoo Gunn Clappaz
And bank safe crackers
Pot-pushin hustlers and everyday jackers
When flauntin' get cautioned if you don't ride with the right crew
?????????????????? and bust off when they can front on you
I still do
Smoke buds with the thugs
About to face the judge 
Show all my niggaz love
I can't knock the hustle, get your cream by all means
Do what you gotta do to live, to feed you and your seeds

Bucktown's everywhere I see
Representatives livin' nocturnally
Break a day on the regular
All night is all right with us
As long as we can get rid of the red we get the better
But never lose your head, just maintain
Only use the cushion pain to ease your brain
No strain
When Tek and Steele bang
Ain't shit changed from birth
be	-see-see degrees, on to them other planes

Cocoa Brovaz,"Here's the science, it seem like yesterday to me
H.N.B. robbery, in Manhattan for currency
Sittin' up in the crib, drawin' out a map
On where security was gon' leave the door open at

Park the van around back, the M.P. jet black
We should be in and out 60 seconds flat
So son what's the deal? He ain't takin' his route
He rather stay home like a bitch, and have a alibi

What his cut look like, he think he takin' half
While we do all the dirt, he sit home on his ass
I got a funny feeling son, somethin' just ain't right
Kinda glad, I didn't go wit Rum and them that night

And sure enough nigga, you best to believe
Duke snitched under the hot light, like steady people
Wit a vote than a Clinton, Rum and me
Him in cell 2, and me in cell 3

Now some of these niggas are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you ever been bit by a snake
Take a minute to think if you can truly trust the click you click wit

Me off the job would of been easy, if son wouldn't have been greedy
I told him to parle, 'cause he one high jet speedin'
Laughin', countin', tryin' to play with money he ain't got
No knowledge of himself, and the trigger gave him heart

He just finish biddin', some remote federal prison
D said he was quotin' niggas, word to word shittin'
To get a light of sense, evident as I remember
When Dunn Dunn got knocked, I just seen him last summer

At Soul In The Hole, it was a King E. King game
First time out his crib, the kid got body, he got blamed
For being the last one seen, fleein' from the scene
Walk was with him up there, he said Duke was held obscene

On some in and out a cell, C.O. slayed him on his mail
His family got banked, he out on 200 foul bail
Myself I don't trust, and that's ya man, so you bust him
'cause every man, know a dead man don't answer questions

It was all love, when push came to shove
I had back, till one kid got clapped
They lock G, for conspiracy
He turn around tryin rattle me, Arabic

I know about this type of shit, snitches do exist
To all my dunns, holdin' guns
Gettin' funds, watch ya self
Through most of ya crimes by delf

Now some of these niggas are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you ever been bit by a snake
Take a minute to think if you can truly trust the click you click wit

She said she love me, but she took me for granted, when she panic
Flip the whole street, to some shit I couldn't handle it
From my man from up the hill, what the deal?
The block is heatin' up, and I need to cop steel

Come and see me, come bring dough 'cause, I can't afford a freebie
And come alone son, 'cause cats know to be snitchin' on TV
Be easy, I'm out but my love wanna tease me
Shorty want some attention, not to mention wanna please me

Hold tight, I'll be back in a flash, don't worry
You got money honey, stop actin' funny
Out the door, to care of my B.I.Z.
And I know this muthafuckas that's eyein' me

Is it a set-up, I peel but I make a detour
And come back, and see my shorty talkin' wit the law
I witnessed her trappin' 'bout my business
Where I be goin', who I know in the industry

She sex me good, but I should of known
Come into this world alone
Leave this world alone
Word is bond

Now some of these niggas are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you ever been bit by a snake
Take a minute to think if you can truly trust the click you click wit

And some of these niggas look just like you

Cocoa Brovaz,"Yeah, after Dah Shinin, it all became clear to me
I knew things would be different son
I knew it'd come time for a change
Seems like the time is now

Jah! Rastafarai

Greetings to my soldiers and soldierettes

Jewel on the world, make the earth sink
On the brink of divinity, defying gravity
Reachin' for infinity
Can he be incarcerated by the limits
Stuck, they can't function
Caught up in the scrimage
This game called life only lasts minutes
Once you in it, be in it to win it to the finish

As the sun heats, I put my feet to the concrete
Hard to sleep so I take it to the streets
Hold my head up, try to keep it movin'
Fed up with losin'
I need some air
I think I take a cruise with you
I'm using, what little know how I possess
To keep our familia down to rest
Now I stress defensive tactics
'Cause police seem active
Got me in the crib sleepin' with heat under the mattress


In case of home intrusion:
First the dogs go ""bark""
Then about five sparks bringin' light to the dark
Like ? does his movement when he's dealin' with math
Or the boss tell his workers where he's keepin' the stash
When that gun blast, better have Jah on your side
Or an act of devine intervention from the most high
I know guys that get a thrill from the kill
And other niggaz, who hold the greed to sling ?frills?

Chorus
Demon's tryin' to take my soul away
But they won't get my soul today
Will I get locked up or blown away?
Just stayin' strong is a price to pay
(Repeat)

Damn I haven't worked since I was 'bout 17
They had time busy hangin' out being a drama fiend
I had to run the streets, see what the night brought out
Sneak in the crib
Hear my moms prayin' to God that I sprout
Take all responsibilities like a man would do
'Cause she know that the streets can bring the worst out of you
She told me concentrate on school but what I do about loot?
I want to push the fat ride, have bitches sweatin' me too
But you know you need dough so you can do the do
And going to class everyday don't bring in no loot
Plus I just been told that I was cold by club bouncers
Standing there hot headed ?bout to set it while they denounce us
Crab niggaz still beggin? for CD?s
While brothaz? careers is stuck on halt and freeze
About to face extinction ?pockets dead is thinkin??
Something ain't peace and suicide?s part of my thinkin?
Even God don't hear my prayer or him just not care
Got a son in this world, stressed out losin? my hair

Chorus

It?s time to take the struggle to the pavement
Let the people know the mayor sent the OK for enslavement
Orders from the government
Official stubborn men with egos runnin? shit
They put the hit out on whoever try to get out
And they are the directors who are dead and ?
Even down south in Atlanta
Police play the pawn for their master
It?s a disaster, practicing who can kill us faster
For less than nothin? like they did Bobby Huton
Corruption got me clutchin? my rifle for gun bustin?
Somethin?s cookin?
Look at the way some faces be lookin?
Cross the bank rock on to Brooklyn, Texas
Even in Houston P?s be shootin? us like sitting ducks in groups
And I can't trust who or what
That will explain the way I watch you, plus,
I know the chosen are few
Many come around to proclaim things they know not
Let alone maintain
Shame, some of my worst enemies
Live right around me and look just like me
I see that its time to intensify the movements in front of my eyes
can't rely on a seeing dog they got me
Or lay and wait for the devil to surprise me, nah G

Chorus (twice)
 It only takes a line to make the mind think
Drop a jewel on the world make the earth sink
I'm on the brink of divinity, defying gravity
Reaching for infinity
Plenty be incarcerated by the limits
Stuck they can't function caught up in the scrimage
This game called life only lasts minutes
Once you in it, be in it to win it ?till the finish

Brooklyn born, I be Steele on the real

For some reason, niggas be fiendin'
And when niggas be fiendin, they be quick to commit treason
But I keep breathin' through, though the season do
Be seemin' to get a lot more hot than usual
So, who can I confide in, who can I trust to bust when I'm ridin'
I don't need no last minute surprises

There's only a few that could ride for free
I hold my weight plus yours, when you can't hold ya own

Every clique got a soft nigga in it, believe me
That potray a kid he saw on the streets or in the movies
Tryin' to do the same he seen on the screen
Got his big guns, Timbs, hoody and his jeans
Talk the fast talk but there's a pause in this walk
Rock his jewels, truck and he still eat pork
He get his little hustle on, he run with his major team
Crazy ass dread from Jamaica, Queens
Ain't never seen war up in his face before
Get his news from the barber shop beeper store
But if you let him tell it, he's the last man standing
talkin' bout son, I held it down with the cannon
Should of seen the way that I was blazin' at the cats
Twist of the wrist, while I was pattin' one back
Like that kid did to Menace, when he had the four pound
You know it's only right, I had to hold the fort down

Blazin' with' ya friends, when we ridin'

Tryin' to big up, tryin' to big up with my master plan

As a youth I would sit up in my room and dream
One day I became with a ruthless teen
Little did I know that every step I took

Brooklyn's in the house
Brooklyn's in the house

S-T, supreme teacher, read you like a preacher
Seat you down, make you pay close attention to my ether
My aura illuminates, removin' the snakes who lay awake
Lovin' to hate but we still elevate

Massagin' the brain, utilize the wisdom contained
Through the knowledge of my circumference and how to maintain
Some nights I walk with the understanding, build cypher
Like Charles Bronson, vigilante ready to snipe ya

Ignite the marijuana, roll a cigar from Havana
Tony Santana, smokin' in the Coco Cabana
Or in the sauna, after doing my Calisthenics
Universal metrics, reversin' the hex, cursin' the sexist

Accepting my blessings, remembering my lessons
Take my dog's suggestions
When he told me keep my smith and Wesson
For protection, the streets is watching and they testin'
They know when you're frontin' and when you're representin'

It's not where you be or how you be
Or who you be or what you got
Unique sounds, grounds is hot
We comin' through, we tidal waves in this rap shit
Now how you be, now who you be and where you be?

You wanna get with the brothers, that's the illest
The microphone have sex with my lyrics
Hit shit off, first move is doggy style
No premature ejaculation, last for a while

Flippin' and turnin' and splittin' it, all type positions
Grabbin' and tuggin' and yokin' it, all type of missions
Crazy, nah, I'm not that type of brother
My verses, when they out in the streets, they carry rubbers

I heard you're drippin', your rap style got gonorrhea
Exploitations of nations, look at this, it's here, yo
Seven days around the clock ass all in the videos
I know you like it, I do too, love the cheese, yo

But this is hip hop, stop it, go make a porno
Not player hatin', on the mic I'm player scrapin'
Nobody seen it, whole eons change to Zeniths
I bounce styles that's sexual, plus I'm intellectual

Thoughts transverse to physical, I keep it spiritual
I got the motts, you bust the dutch, I got the hydro
I just sit back on tracks and let it flow

Feel this, feel this
Brooklyn's in the house
Brooklyn's in the house

I give you agony, agony, agony, you wanna rump with me?
Constantly, constantly, constantly rollin' a phonta leaf
You know it's beef when you gettin' stomped losin' teeth
Because you sweet and ain't got no claims to the street

You'se the type to get shot and go explain to the cops
Come to court every day, make sure a nigga get locked
But I thought you had that big glock that you bust a whole lot
Then why my nigga's sittin' up in that little cell block?

I'm tellin' ya, ock, the world is a spot for snid-akes
Niggas who hid-ate, do anything to get the pid-apes
Love to see me down and out, blood in my mouth
Steez all sweated out, tied up in my house

Can I live and still give, take my team on sprees?
Twistin out skeeze out of custom drop-top v's?
You know the pedigrees, always stay blowin' the dick
When B.G.S. is the squad, the dice stay on the six

Nuff of dem still in di valley of dry bones
Dem ah search dem seven seas, dem, ah, throw stick and stone

Da minute di countdown say dis ah di final showdown

Well, some ah said dem ah star, dem love car
Dem at war and a blur, dem nah really reach far
But nuff ah dem ah bafoon, dem ah goon

A-fi warn dem, if dem nah listen, so we scorn dem
We gonna steer far from dem
I know that we are kings and we love nice things
But we not sell out fi no diamond ring

Yo, I got da Lord in ah mi mind
So any which part mi come, mi ah go shine

Let's do it like soldiers - all and together now!
Ready? Hell yeah, y'all niggas better get ready
No retreat, no surrender, death before dishonor motherfucker!
Do it to 'em, c'mon never die thuggish, uhh - YES YES YES
Say what? (Eastside, Westside ride) Where ya at, where ya at?
Where my real thugs, where ya at, where ya at?

Hehehe, send cases to the drug dealer
Real thugs, where ya at? You motherfuckin' home
Do it to 'em, do it to 'em
They love the way we do it to 'em, we do it to 'em

Suppress the revolution of premeditated scheme
Introduce a drug called crack to us ghetto teens
Got a law for raw niggas, now, playa what it be like?
When will niggas see they got us bleedin' with three strikes
Can't seem to focus hopeless, with violent thoughts I wrote this
Got these Devils petrified, hidin' from my hocus-pocus
And so I learned to earn my currency and over time
Affiliated, clearly click a military mind
May God forgive us though we dwell inside a paradox
Thugged out and drug dealin', from the womb to the block
My live mind got me survivin' five rounds (shots)
My forty-five got me fortified with live rounds
When shit's thick we plot hits, when our Glock spits
All hail, out on bail, wrath of the 2Pacalypse
Forever ghetto necessary picture food stamps
Outlaw Thug Niggas never left the boot camp

They called us for assignment, one of the squad's finest
Skills in guerilla warfare and blessed with refinement
My rap sheet, contains sections of bomb sessions
Says I'm responsible for black Smif-N-Wessun
Puttin likkle yout's in a military state of mind
Dangerous like chronic and yard when combined
Cocoa Brovaz 'pon de borderline
Test de sound and ye dead same ti-ime

Man to man, I'm facin' the Devil with a plan
Judo stance, first glance, I'm makin' my advance
Animal instincts, intelligence of an assassin
Masked men, ninjas that surround me, ready to attack
I react swiftly, what father taught me sticks with me
Never forget the method, stick and move strictly
Shit be seemin' like it's closin' in
With no regrets I hold position
Cause I suppose I'm one of the chosen men

Picture being put in a position to move
And you can't move cause your move is blocked by the knight
At twelve o'clock, that's when the madness begins
So I start to focus in, my thoughts on the war
Cause the rule is the law, and the law that we live by
Is to stay true to self, in this case, BDI
Why try if ya body lie
By the block true soldier mentality, this is how we rock and roll
(This is how we ride)

Stick and move, time to show 'em how to make a move
Or get moved on, let's see who strong

In the gaze of the strange, where nothin stays the same
Where new faces come through with similar game
Now who you thought was them, really ain't
They catchin' deja vu's of the game people play
It's a call for readjustment, fine tune yo' position
You slippin' and trippin' 'stead of bobbin and dippin'
But never let this world of stress get the best of me
Takin' breathin' techniques, slay you with Tai-Chi

What does it take, to get a break in the world of snakes
And dose who fake
Elimination I'm facin' destruction
Outlawed, so I duck and down, fo'-fo' is bustin', no one to trust in
Rushin' to the goal line
Catch a nigga beat him treat him like he stole mine
No swine I'm a soldier, soldier I control mine
Time to, take you, back into time - follow dis here

One way out, this black hole
For this black soul, shit is outta control
I'm fightin' for my position to be a fetus in this world I'm enterin'
And my face is sentencin' for repentance
Before my body was fully formed into a human
I was already consumin' weed
Cause my moms used to smoke back in the 70's
Maybe that's why in the 90's I drop G's when I drop degrees
When I ease across the block with 'Pac
Got all y'all niggas shocked
You didn't think Boot Camp Clik would link, with a Outlaw mind?
If you do you press rewind
And you can peep guerilla tactics in every line

Yeah, and this is how we do it!
Where my real thugs, where they at?
Let me, see my real thugs, now where ya at?
Won'tcha, see my real thugs, where ya at?

Oh I baptized so many boats, all got lost at sea.
Oh I capsized when the waves becames too tall for me.
But I want ,
I want the rain to fall.

When you pray there’s hope and fear in your voice.
I believe in you as much as you believe in God.

So much nightfall around us, we are gold and blue,
And we just can’t see below us but we won’t need to.

That I'm the only one for you,

When I wake up, all I want all I had's,

Assis en tailleur voilà des heures que je médite
Sur ma montagne je n'arrive pas à faire le vide
Je focalise sur le diaphragme, j'augmente mon énergie
Réveille la bête qui dans mon âme est tapie
Je viens de terminer ma préparation mentale
Ils vont goûter à l'incomparable style du Serval
Le souffle des quatre vents décuple ma puissance
De longs mois de travail ont exacerbé mes sens
Je crée un déséquilibre interne volontairement
Afin que le côté Yang soit le dominant
Les pieds solidement ancrés dans la Terre
Je tire les dernières forces de la nature mère nourricière
Je mène les troupes au combat pour défaire
Les guerriers en contre-plaqué de l’école du micro en bois
Notre bannière flotte au sommet du Tsunami
Annonçant fièrement la charge du micro d'argent
En plein cœur de la bataille
Je sème la terreur quand je frappe d'estoc et de taille

I sang along with the words that she said
Happy and bad
""Where goes the time?""

Begging bowl blues
Wrapped round my head
Like a fistful of news nobody reads

Me and her name I can't recall

Wishing the hours would take me away
Just for a while

That I am so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind",Always on My Mind,2003
Cody Bryant,"A long time forgotten
Are dreams that just fell by the way.
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today.
But she never complains
Of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord.
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

He likes the night life,
The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.
When the party's all over,
She'll welcome him back home again.
Lord knows she don't understand him,
But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman;
She loves her good-timin' man.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.

My woman left me, so tonight I'll be drinkin' your best.
I'm not talkin' about Single Malt, Scotch, Jagermeister, or Cuervo Gold.
I'll take anything domestic, light, and cold.

Domestic, light, and cold, that's what I'm havin'.

Pop a top, crack a can, just don't make me wait too long.

No, I wasn't cheatin'. She just said that I was hard to please.
And I'll admit it: I can be set in my country ways.
So go ahead and break out the good stuff, if I can be so bold.

Cody Canada,"Sherry was a waitress at the only joint in town
She had a reputation as a girl who'd been around
Down Main Street after midnight with a brand new pack of cigs
A fresh one hangin' from her lips and a beer between her legs
She'd ride down to the river and meet with all her friends
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

Sonny was a loner he was older than the rest
He was going into the Navy but he couldn't pass the test
So he hung around town he sold a little pot
The law caught wind of Sonny and one day he got caught
But he was back in business when they set him free again
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

Sonny's playin' 8-ball at the joint where Sherry works
When some drunken outta towner put his hand up Sherry's skirt
Sonny took his pool cue laid the drunk out on the floor
Stuffed a dollar in her tip jar and walked on out the door
She's runnin' right behind him reachin' for his hand 
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

They jumped into his pickup Sonny jammed her down in gear
Sonny looked at Sherry and said lets get on outta here
The stars were high above them and the moon was in the east
The sun was settin' on them when they reached Miami Beach
They got a hotel by the water and a quart of Bombay gin
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

They soon ran out of money but Sonny knew a man
Who knew some Cuban refugees that delt in contraband
Sonny met the Cubans in a house just off the route
With a briefcase full of money and a pistol in his boot
The cards were on the table when the law came bustin' in
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

The Cubans grabbed the goodies and Sonny grabbed the Jack
He broke a bathroom window and climbed on out the back
Sherry drove the pickup through the alley on the side
Where a lawman tackled Sonny and was reading him his rights
She stepped into the alley with a single shot .410
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

They left the lawman lyin' and they made their getaway
They got back to the motel just before the break of day
Sonny gave her all the money and he blew her a little kiss
If they ask you how this happened say I forced you into this
She watched him as his taillights disappeared around the bend
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

Its Main Street after midnight just like it was before
21 months later at the local grocery store
Sherry buys a paper and a cold 6-pack of beer
The headlines read that Sonny is goin' to the chair
She pulls back onto Main Street in her new Mercedes Benz
The road goes on forever and the party never ends",The Road Goes on Forever,2009
Cody Canada,"When I was a young man barely seventeen
I went on out to Hollywood chasing my dream
And dusty Oklahoma was all I'd ever seen
And I was getting older
Memories of the greyhound
Fade and quickly pass
Lonely restaurant windows
And the empty hourglass
Reflect the human hunger
Of the questions never asked
And I only had my time for spending

[Chorus]
I'm goin' on back to Tulsa just one more time
I'm goin' on back to Tulsa just one more time
I'm goin' on back to Tulsa just one more time
I've got home sweet Oklahoma on my mind

Now I'm growing younger
And how I just don't know
Life's a lot more happy
And it's movin' nice and slow
The past is just some photographs
Of the good friends that I know
And my love is so much better
Yes it is

You better move around at night
They don't like no transportation
Slippin' in and out of sight

They don't care 'bout Wichita
If you're ever in Oklahoma
You better move around the law

They got fines and they got plenty
Hold you up for days on end
Threaten your life take your money
Make you think you're here to stay

Was the last time I made her cry
I talked myself out of believin'
That true true love never dies

First time I thought of returnin'
Was just ten lonesome miles out of town
My foolish pride kept these wheels a turnin'
And there was nothin' on this earth gonna shut me down

If I had one drop of water
For each and every tear I have cried
I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow

You know pride will forsake you by and by

You make me laugh and that ain't easy
You make me give my heart to you
And girl that?s one thing I just don?t do
Look what you?ve done I never needed anyone but I need you
You made me dream and I?m not a dreamer
I?ve had my doubts now I?m a believer.
I?ve changed my ways because of you.
And Girl, that?s one thing I just don?t do.
Look what you?ve done I never needed anyone but I need you.
You turned my world upside down and showed me things that I would have missed.
Before you I never knew that life could be as good as this.
You make feel a little deeper
You make me stay when I was leaver.
You made me say I love you.

Then he slept with the waitress from the bar
Then she took a chain to his car
And broke the windows on the love they had, redneck love gone bad

He got all liquored up, tried to hot wire her truck
Next thing he knew, he was seeing stars
While her daddy knocked him all around the yard
Oh, what a night they had, redneck love gone bad

'Round and around the blue lights go
Everybody's smoking and watching the show but it's over now

But to me it's plain, redneck love gone bad, oh, pick him redneck

Every Friday night we see them cruise through town
A few months back, she ran away, with a truck driver named Jose
She's happy and he's so glad, redneck love gone bad

And a waitress in Nevada, she says she's carrying my child

There'll be none of him no more

Lick your lips as I soak my feet

In cerca di un'altra casa

Sputo rime come fumo denso
Fra le ultime file come le lacrime di chi ha perso e non lo vuole dire
E spera di rimettersi in paro

Cancella i lividi e i tagli che abbiamo

Ogni volta mi guardo allo specchio mi tocco le palle
Pensando che alle volte esagero
Dissaputo, frate' sei come se mi dissa Pluto
L'ultimo rimasto inevoluto
Sei il figlio che Vasco non ha mai voluto
Pensi che sia impazzito
Un'amico immaginario ripete ""sta zitto""
Almeno scrivi una canzone per un partito
Ma da un po' che sono già partito
Dormo vestito, colpa dell'erba mi buco la felpa, è una vita di merda
Dico sorridi, brindiamo a noi tristi
Il boss della major non vende più dischi
Selfmade, yes mate, tutto fatto in casa tipo sextape
Per questa non serve il translate
La tua tipa manifesta al trans day
Sono avvilito, impallinato, impallidito
Mai avuto un alibino adibito
Il mic che registra è allibito
Lebon è come Alain Delon del Rap
Pardone moi
Sta volta mi sa che ho esagerato (brah)

A volte esagero (ah)
Accomodati prego
Mi serviva una casa grande per il mio ego
A volte esagero (ah)
Sto comodo dì dietro
Se vado in giro con un Hammer guida il mio ego
A volte esagero (ah)
A volte esagero ma
Se devo dirtelo in tutta sincerità
A volte esagero ma
A volte esagero, nah
Non siamo così lontani dalla realtà

Marracash! Salmo Lebon, Coez, esagerati, cazzo

Passo leggero, cammini sotto un cielo aperto in due
Cercavi lei ma dalla porta ti hanno aperto in due, cristo

Ma immagina che non si cancella quello che hai visto

Fuori dalla cella di chi prega Dio
Non è un problema mio
Volevi un braccio ma ti prendi il dito
Let it go, let it be, come i Beatles

Se penso a te su ‘sto beat t’ho deriso
Se penso al tuo cervello penso a un chicco de riso

Pagavo i miei dischi con il sudore di un magazzino
Poi quando cresci, ti accorgi delle magagne
Pensavi fosse amore, invece erano cagne
Capisci che non è tutt'oro anche se luccica
Dalla Punto di Lucci ah, in giro per la mia città
Ho preso calci in faccia per le mie parole
Ma sta merda buca il petto senza avere le pistole
Senza amore per chi spara a zero
Senza te, senza stereo muori sotto i riflettori
È il coma degli ascoltatori

Non basteranno i soldi per i dischi che ho inciso
Non basta che ci provi se mi nominano
Per sempre vostro yeah, still fenomeno wo

Chi è cambiato in questi anni io forse no

Vissuti anche i miei drammi

Co' n'obiettivo chiaro

Mischiando il voglio con il posso
Senza scordare mai manco per un minuto che sto mondo è nostro

Ci trovi sempre in strada, secco, come dire?
Eh, eh, sputapalline

Che siamo pronti a tutto fino all'ultimo respiro
Al bar dei mostri è gossip, t'offro un altro giro
Che dormo quando muoio e vivo come 'n vampiro
Grinda oggi, brillerai domani
Brinda oggi e brinderai domani
Io voglio solo i soldi, fanculo la fama
'Sto stronzo corre per la filigrana
Puttana 'sta vita, vole esse' pagata
Un'ostrica fregata pe' 'na perla
'N affogato de 'sto Amaro Averna
Fanculo 'sti infami, sperano che perda
Un giorno solo su 'sta terra, sta lontano dalla merda
Il pugno chiuso in tasca perché guardano de sbieco
Prima sbrigo questa dopo te lo spiego
Ho un deal da chiude'
Schiera di conchiglie crude
Bone come donne nude, apparecchiate qua davanti
Prima de pregare tutti quanti i santi
Prima le risate dopo i pianti

Io vorrei solo gira' sopra 'na Bentley
Magari prima me ridate la patente
Io vorrei le mie lettere stampate sulla targa
Bruciare la tua merda d'auto mentre passi in quarta

Che sai di me?
La verità sta in bocca ma la vedi uscire
Ora solo per l'euro, prima per le lire

T'ho chiamata il diciannove dopo quella foto un po' bora 
Un po' poser (pronto amo'?)
Ho detto, ""Andiamo""
Hai detto, ""Come? Dove? Non mi fido che sei un grande attore""
""Ce lo so""
Affogo il sonno sotto le pezze
Magliette stese sul balcone mozzicate da mollette
A cena tonno in scatolette e due birrette
A Parco Gondar il sole non c'abbronza mai
La brezza ansima
Lei gioca a fare l'ultima romantica, magica
Andiamo per i trenta con le posate in plastica
Stavo senza tuta all'ora di ginnastica
Parto all'inseguimento di una Mini della Red Bull
Stormi di PR in strada che s'accollano
Rifiuto un'altra russa top sorca fake on Facebook
Schivo l'inghippo al volo come fossi un matador
In vacanza con un solo jeans
T'ho cioccata con la tua bff
M'è scesa una lacrima di gin e
Parli a gesti, pare che giochi al Gioca Jouer

E io che già ragionavo per due
Ballavi e ti tenevo per la gonna
Cercavo l'ombra
A Parco Gondar
E io che già ragionavo per due
Scappavi e ti tiravo per la gonna
Cercavo l'ombra
A Parco Gondar

In mare i cavalloni al trotto
S'è ritirato Totti e so' quasi ventotto
So' baci a mezza bocca, ci so' rimasto sotto
Ti cerco nella vodka, ma poi non trovo posto
Fa la gnorri gnorri, ehi
Dove corri corri, ehi
Abbassiamo i toni, sì
Vorrei dieci Oki, ehi ehi
So cotto di lei lo può vedere pure un cieco
Vorrei abbracciarti però resto a mezzo metro 
Non so come andrà, non c'ho la palla di vetro
So solo che amo quel vedo non vedo (sì)
E non capisco ancora quei tuoi punti e virgola
Ti vorrei ogni mattina come in edicola, ehi
Uo
Vieni a casa mia con me

E io che già ragionavo per due
Ballavi ti tenevo per la gonna
Cercavo l'ombra
A Parco Gondar
E io che già ragionavo per due
Scappavi e ti tiravo per la gonna
Cercavo l'ombra

Il giorno dopo io l'ho detto a scuola
Ero tranquillo, forse solo scemo
Oh a volte se mi sei vicino tremo

Coffee,"Where you roam to be transformed and renewed
Do not be conformed unto what the world do
Be washed by the word and renew the mind
Take the mud from your eyes and quit walking with the blind

A lot of busters play tricks and try to fade this
But they know they can't deny the like the way it ride
I reside on the left hand of the map
Pray to God every day for protection where I'm at
From the land of funkadelic inspired beats
Mobbin' from church in impalas to swap meets
Trying to take this rap game to another level
On point like the crease on my khakis gaffel the devil
Bow down to the one who's always able to hear us
Never wrong will he steer us keep the evil far from near us

Curious of multiplicity in this thang called the rap game
Everybody claiming be different but sounding the same
Don't fold, Don't let the music take control
Of your soul to get the bank roll
At times thinking of varied and different kinds
Of people poppin' in tapes hearin' sound-a-like rhymes
My mind is turnin' trying to figure out why
That everytime we shoe 'em Christ people try to turn back
Still though kickin' it to you like toe to heel bro
If you didn't know the Mid-West kicks the quick flow
See, it just dazzles me
Original individuals is what we strive to be

Tighten my style and maintain it like gals do braids
Take my time to elevate like wrecking balls on cranes
Hoping you get convicted if you feel you done wrong
Like people doused in denim livin' within' prison walls
Comin' out the area where the twang bang
Like a mix 'tween Shania Twain and a chain gang
When you roam pay attention to they song before you clone it
Like disciples on a boat finding fish we boat it, boat it

Who said the girls can't rhyme? Well that's a fable
A female that's a Factor is just as quick to grab the cable
Unless, if best, we rock a show with wireless
Verbalize in the chrome dome into the abyss
Servin' hard not for the money yet divinely employed
Writin' checks by the word that never comes back void
I've ensued to be renewed and navigate through difficulty
Watch him work his wonders in his time he catapults me
From start to finish from the hip I hop in it
Like a pair of new shoes I can't wait another minute
Soak the truth and try to speak it to my people
He ain't never done son keep your ears peeled For the sequel!

Coffee,"If this world were mine, I'd place at your feet
All that I own; you've been so good to me
If this world were mine
I'd give you the flowers, the birds and the bees
For with your love inside me, that would be all I need
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything

If this world were mine, I'd make you a king
With wealth untold, you could have anything
If this world were mine
I'd give you each day so sunny and blue
If you wanted the moonlight, I'd give you that too
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything

Oh baby, you're my consolation
And there's no hesitation
When you want me, honey, just call me

And honey, you're my inspiration
I feel so much sensation
When I'm in your arms, when you squeeze me

And the sky would be blue
As long as you're lovin' me

With you here in my arms
Life is so wonderful

Give me pretty lovin', baby
Give me pretty lovin', honey
Keep on lovin' me
You know I need you, baby
