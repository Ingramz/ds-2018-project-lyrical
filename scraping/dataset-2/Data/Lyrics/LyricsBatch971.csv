Saliva,"I'm addicted to
Every single thing you do
I'm dying inside

You're sucking me down
Makes me feel I'm gonna drown
It's killing me now
All you do is bring me down

All this time, in all your lies
It has been
No surprise now, realize now

How could you cheat on me?
Then turn your back on me
You told me all the lies
And hypnotized, and I believed

How could you cheat on me?
Then turn your back on me
You told me all the lies
And hypnotized, and I believed

I'm coming to know
All the secrets that you hold
You think I'm a fool and don't know what you do
A look in your eyes and I finally realize

All this time, in all your lies
It has been no surprise now, realize now

How could you cheat on me?
Then turn your back on me
You told me all the lies
And hypnotized, and I believed

How could you cheat on me?
Then turn your back on me
You told me all the lies
And hypnotized, and I believed

And now with all your pride
You still can't look me in the eye
And now in all your shame
You can't even speak my name

How could you cheat on me?
Then turn your back on me
You told me all the lies
And hypnotized, and I believed

How could you cheat on me?
Then turn your back on me
You told me all the lies
And hypnotized, and I believed

I'm addicted to
Every single thing you do
I'm dying inside

Saliva,"Ladies and gentlemen, here I come again
I consider everyone you folks my friends
Been gone for a while but I'm back again
To host a mother lovin' party that never ends

You've been beside me through all my ups and downs
You've seen me fall and you've seen me stand up so proud
You've seen me draw everyone one of you in to a crowd
So throw your hands up and shout it out loud

Go, go, go, go, go, go, come on, come on
Go, go, go, go, go, go, come on, come on

'Cause here we come again, everybody get all your friends
And forget the world's confusion, it's a family reunion
We can make you feel alright if you open up your eyes
And forget the world's confusion, it's a family

Hear the crowd go boom, boom
Hear the crowd go, hear the crowd go boom, boom
Hear the crowd go, hear the crowd go

Now that you can feel the music deep inside
Listen to the lyrics, open up your mind
Feel the power of the beat between your thighs
You're damn right, we came to take you on a ride

Everything that you heard in the past is gone
Let it all fade away 'cause you can't hold on
Sit back while I wrestle this microphone
And raise your hands up and shout it out loud

Go, go, go, go, go, go, come on, come on
Go, go, go, go, go, go, come on, come on

'Cause here we come again, everybody get all your friends
And forget the world's confusion, it's a family reunion
We can make you feel alright if you open up your eyes
And forget the world's confusion, it's a family

Hear the crowd go boom, boom
Hear the crowd go, hear the crowd go boom, boom
Hear the crowd go, hear the crowd go

'Cause here we come again, everybody get all your friends
And forget the world's confusion, it's a family reunion
We can make you feel alright if you open up your eyes
And forget the world's confusion, it's a family

Hear the crowd go, hear the crowd go boom, boom
Hear the crowd go, hear the crowd go

Took her hand and led her home
Came home drunk from town and he took his gun and he shot her down

Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

Some get a kick from cocaine,
I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

With some gal in the sky,
Is my idea of nothing to do,

Sally Ann Triplett,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.

As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

Your words poetic are not pathetic
On the other hand, boy, you shine
And I can feel after every line

Sally Ann Triplett,"Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
From wanting far too much for far too long
Looking back, I could have done it differently
Won a few more moments, who can tell?
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know, I know him well

Wasn't it good, Wasn't it fine
Isn't it madness he can't be mine
But in the end, he needs a little more than before
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well

No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side
And though I move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide
Looking back, I could have played it differently
Learned about the man before I fell
But I was ever so much younger then

Wasn't it good (oh so good), 
Wasn't it fine (so fine)
Isn't it madness he can't be mine

Didn't I know how it would go

Sally Anne Marsh,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find

Sally Harmon,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

Were hands that I could hold,
I'd keep them warm and in my hands
They'd not turn cold.

Hand in hand we'd choose
The moments that should last.
The lovely moments that
Should have no future and no past.

The summer from the top of the swing,
The comfort in the sound of a lullaby,
The innocence of leaves in the spring,
But most of all the moment
When love first touched me!

Would never learn to fly,
Until the hands of time
Would choose to wave Goodbye.",Brian's Song (The Hands of Time),1994

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1995

She'll brighten the kingdom around God's great throne
May the Angels have peace, God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam

When a girl of sixteen, we courted each other
She promised some night to become my sweet wife
I bought her a ring to wear on her finger
But the Angels, they called her to Heaven one night

A jewel here on earth, a jewel in Heaven
She'll brighten the kingdom around God's great throne
May the Angels have peace, God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam

This world has its wealth, its trials and troubles
Mother earth holds her treasures of diamonds and gold
But she can't hold the soul of one precious jewel
She's resting in peace in that Heavenly home

A jewel here on earth, a jewel in Heaven
She'll brighten the kingdom around God's great throne
May the Angels have peace, God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam

Wow baby

Sally Mountain Show,"My heart can sing when I pause to remember
A heartache here is but a stepping stone
Along a path that's winding always upward
This troubled world is not my final home.

But until then my heart will go on singing
Until then with joy I'll carry on
Until the day my eyes behold my Saviour
Until the day God calls me home.

--- Instrumental ---

The things of earth will dim and lose their value
If we recall they're borrowed for a while
And things of earth that cause this heart to tremble
Remember there will only bring a smile.

But until then my heart will go on singing
Until then with joy I'll carry on
Until the day my eyes behold my Saviour
Until the day God calls me home...",Until Then,1991

We wander barefoot on the sunset sand

Rising at dawn, keep the children warm with his cloak of honey

Guilt was in his heart
A broken glass in a blood stained hand
A woman with a broken heart
Somehow he knew he'd gotta find a way
Out of this prison cell
He looked up to the familiar skies
For a secret they might tell
Then Orion shone in the coal black night
He saw Andromeda rising
A golden light shone all around
Like the answer he had found
There were tears in his eyes
Like the rainy sky
His past life was an illusion
And he stands, a new born man as he sees Andromeda rising
He left his home and he left his wife
He left his family
But every place that he traveled through
Himself he still could see
Somewhere there's gotta be a place
With no bitter memories
And just at the point he was breaking down
He looked up through the trees
Then Orion shone in the coal black night
He saw Andromeda rising
A golden light shone all around

Sunrise feeling with golden fingers, the edges of the night
There's a hush in the air, in his silver hair
King Solomon is my father

Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah's sending children of the sun

The rain is bringing tears from my lovers land
I watch the silver stars melt in love with the sea
I cry to the wind bring back my lover to me
Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah's sending children of the sun

My lover's hands are whiter than the wings of a dove
His hair is softest fire that fall in heavenly love
His smile is a blue birds cry on a midsummer's morn
His kiss is the touch of the sun before the earth's new dawn.
Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah's sending children of the sun

My lover used to bring me stars he found in the sand
I would lay the singing skies inside his tiny hand
Tonight the moon is dripping on the coloured river we knew
O take me where he lies cryin' in the mornin' dew

She filled up his window with soft milky light
'Til he crawled up the chimney and into the night

Chorus:
But the moon she rises and the moon she falls
And her slow white eye sees nothing at all

Down on the sidewalks a crowd gathered 'round
Flinging up bricks and bottles to knock the boy down
He stood up above them with his hands in the air
Calling up to the moonbeams, ""Come let down your hair!""

(repeat chorus)

He wanted to feel like a bucket of milk
Or sweet summer wind on rolling green hills
He wanted to fly up from the roof
Sailing up from the night wind to the arms of the moon

(repeat chorus two times)

Se dimagrisco di me vi resta solo la voce
Lo so, mia madre pensa che mi drogo pesante
La mia ragazza invece che vada assieme alle altre
Io nego, fra', ma c'hanno ragione entrambe
Sospetto che mi prendano un campione di sangue
Ma non c'è, ma non c'è, ma non c'è, ma non c'è
Ma non c'è una cura per l'anima
Droghe per sfasciarsi, per superare i complessi
E dopo psicofarmaci per rimettere assieme i pezzi
Metà del tempo a farsela e metà a farsela scendere
Il tempo non lo puoi comprare, lo puoi solo vendere

La vita è una troia, veniamo al mondo per soddisfarne le voglie
Aspetto che i fantasmi vengano e mi prendano

Il vuoto tra le mani, Dio pensa nel genio
Sogna nel poeta e dorme tra gli infami

Non prendiamoci in giro
Che già tutto il resto è uno schifo
Ma tu eri di tutti come l'accendino
E io non vivo
Ora che ho più scadenze della roba che ho nel frigo
Nella prossima vita voglio essere uno sportivo
Così se sono il più bravo, cazzo, è oggettivo
Il capitalismo mi ha reso competitivo
E non c'è schiavo più grande di chi pensa di essere libero
E in un mondo in cui la parola non conta niente
È normale annuire ad un altro sapendo che mente
Indurirsi, diventare freddi e taglienti
L'ambiente opera e lascia i ferri dentro i pazienti
Dov'è questo potere dell'amore?
Se poi è l'amore per il potere che consuma le persone
Fra', io non lo vedo, vedo spesso Belén Rodríguez
Forse Dio no, però lei è sempre lì che sorride

Salmo,"Vorrei vedervi morire in fila, vi guardo con mezzo sorriso
In mano un mezzo fondo di tequila
Il piano divino emanda zombie missionari
Per pregare non ti basterebbero I grani dei rosari

No pietà, cuori in pietra la fede nel dito medio amico
Siamo come semi caduti sopra il granito
Un pervertito in sottoveste emana luce celeste,
Ha le spine sulle teste, entro in chiesa col winchester

Va tutto bene! Va tutto bene
Per la vita disegnando croci in aria con due dita
E come ti va? Come siete messi
So che la vita è una puttana ho scritto I numeri su tutti I cessi

Piogge di china, aspetto sotto con fogli bianchi 
Prima che tu mi spazzi via col nome di katrina
Prega shiva, brama la mia trama è distruttiva 
Io ho un dio personale dentro un personal di 'bis sativa

No compromessi (no), dagli ciò che chiedono
Registro versi nel telefono sperando che intercettino
Parlo a gesti, alfabeto morse, chi guarda s'incanta
Rovino chi m'ascolta come I doors, nei settanta

Va tutto bene! Va tutto bene! 
Sogno scheletri e bambini morti sopra le altalene
Dio è morto invano, dio è morto in ogni essere umano
Dio è morto dentro tutte le banche del vaticano

Va tutto bene! Va tutto bene! 
Tra I morsi delle iene siamo come alice: in catene
Come ti va? Come siete messi
So che la vita è una puttana ho scritto I numeri su tutti I cessi

Vorrei vedervi morire uno sopra all'altro in pila
Se ti sto sul cazzo fai la fila dietro gli ottomila
Prega forte, nessun dorma, la mia salma, prendo forma
Io muoio qua, dentro due passi di libertà

Messo in modo illogico un cristo cianotico
Mi segue con lo sguardo dentro un quadro a effetto ottico
Mi pare sia tutto normale, normale
Come un prete, un minorenne e un abuso sessuale. 

Figli di puttana, mafia cristiana brama, conta la grana
Non vedo se l'occhio sgrana, fumo, l'angoscia mi sbrana
Un timorato pensa a sè, il resto va da sé, perché? 
Fa comodo non sapere, quindi ti dico che

Va tutto bene! Va tutto bene! 
Se crepi tu crepo io, lo faremo insieme
E come ti va? Siamo messi male
Senza sogni, senza fede, niente soldi, niente chiese

Un dio personale

Salmo,"Dos gardenias para ti
con ellas quiero decir
te quiero, te adoro, mi vida
Ponles toda tu atención
porque son tu corazon y el mio

Dos gardenias para ti
que tendrán todo el calor de un beso
de esos que te di
y que jamas encontraras
en el calor de otro querer

A tu lado vivirán y te hablaran
como cuando estas conmigo
y hasta creerás
que te dirán te quiero.

Pero si un atardecer
las gardenias de mi amor se mueren
es porque han adivinado
que tu amor se ha marchitado
porque existe otro querer

Dos gardenias, para tí",Yoko-Ono,2005
Salmo,"Dicono che non potrei, dicono che ho il cuore a metà
Scriverti fottuti versi d'amore e il dono dell'ubiquità
Perché potrei vederti ovunque
Negli angoli delle città
Mi basta immaginarti per averti qua!

Parliamo della privacy
Sai, dubito
Hai una chance per andare?
Vai subito
C'hanno visti ma
siamo una canzone intima
da non fare mai in pubblico!
Sanno chi siamo
Sanno che parto e non ti richiamo
Amore tossico
Ama il tuo prossimo
A patto che ti stia lontano
Questa è una trama che conosco già
Lascio che mi deprima
L'amore è un film in testa visto dall'ultima fila
La gente qui ride
Non sa che c'è alla fine
Ogni volta che ti guardo è come vestirmi di spine

Dicono che non potrei, dicono che ho il cuore a metà
Scriverti fottuti versi d'amore e il dono dell'ubiquità
Perché potrei vederti ovunque
Negli angoli delle città
Mi basta immaginarti per averti qua

Ora che non vivo coi miei
Ora che ho cambiato città
Capisco chi sei
La parte mancante, l'esatta metà
Conserva paure private
Credo ci sia un doppio fondo
In queste tasche bucate fino alla parte opposta del mondo
Parliamo della privacy? Sai, dubito
Nella gara per l'amore arrivo ultimo
Dalla bara, dalla paranoia chi ama non pensa, mi ama a intuito
Preferisco l'infarto
A vederti piangere quando riparto
È come morire e sapere di averti guardata negli occhi una volta soltanto
Questa è una trama che conosco già
Lascio che mi deprima
L'amore è un film in testa visto dall'ultima fila
La gente qui ride
Non sa che c'è alla fine
Ogni volta che ti guardo è come vestirmi di spine

Dicono che non potrei, dicono che ho il cuore a metà
Scriverti fottuti versi d'amore e il dono dell'ubiquità
Perché potrei vederti ovunque
Negli angoli delle città
Mi basta immaginarti per averti qua",Faraway,2013
Salmo,"La guerra è fuori, svegliati
Stanotte verrò a prenderti
Giovane e vecchio: Benjamin
Batto il tempo, fermami
Si sa che non moriremo finché
Non avrò preso i miei fottuti soldi dalla SIAE

Ah! Messi da parte dai giovani
Ricordati come i vecchi pedofili
Il mio paese è necropoli, morti in piedi aspettando posti più comodi
Sto invecchiando al bancone del bar
Nel mio paese se ammazzi qualcuno diventi una star
In Italia è un dramma, sai, ma
Mi hanno trattato come un cane in Ucraina
Lo stato è critico, ti trovo così invecchiato che potresti fare il politico
La mia pensione è Misery, non devo morire e finire negli inferi
Batto cassa e il beat sfonda-timpani, passo a spallate come in Bitter Sweet Symphony
Morto di vecchiaia d'inverno, un vecchio scemo infermo
Vecchio come il governo
Davanti allo specchio bambini in eterno

La guerra è fuori, svegliati
Stanotte verrò a prenderti

Da qui la vita fa il percorso inverso
Il mio suicidio sarà breve ma intenso
Tutti questi giovani che muoiono per niente
Ai miei tempi era tutto diverso
Troppo vecchio per andare a casa presto
Troppo giovane per stare in arresto
Un Montgomery su Sean Connery vecchio, come gli oneri da pagare presto
Ci rivediamo tra cent'anni con Ron
Senza capelli con il Phon nell'iPhone
Avrò una figlia cicciona di nome Ivonne
Sarò lo stesso buon vecchio Salmolebon
Come se il tempo girasse al contrario, se scocca lo zero si blocca l'orario
Mi ammazzo stanotte stringendo un rosario, perché ho settant'anni e un lavoro precario
È poco ma è il governo
Davanti allo specchio bambini in eterno

La guerra è fuori, svegliati
Stanotte verrò a prenderti
Giovane e vecchio: Benjamin
Batto il tempo, fermami
Si sa che non moriremo finché
Non avrò preso i miei fottuti soldi dalla SIAE",Old Boy,2013
Salmo,"Se rimo fondo il tempo senti il jet-lag
Suono con il plettro del destino tipo Jack Black
Fanculo il jet-set non faccio hit per teen-ager
Moriremo da leggende dopo Heat Ledger
Muovo la testa come chi acconsente
Fingo un mestiere come chi è al call center
Sono scimmiato tipo 'e tu giù al bar?'
Quando rappo sembro negro come Abdul Jabbar (scherzo)
Schiaccio in faccia slam dunk da i 3
Se performo mi trasformo flow daitarn 3
Hardcore black flag giro lo snapback
Chiudo le rime col machete red neck
Hai mai sentito del mio crew?
Forse l'hai sentito da quando non danno più
Il rock alla tv
Sotto shock sotto stress sotto come Loch Ness
Con il mic distorsione sociale, chiamami Mike Ness
No status symbol, sposato con il rap e mai stato single
Facci l'abitudine la gente sa che l'attitudine da cui attingo
E' così forte che, se rimi, mi stai dietro come Paolini e Mingo
Spingo come extra-c sotto casa, gringo que pasa?
Mando m.c. al tappetro e dillo a Rocky Asap
King come Mufasa, fai la muffa a casa
Sempre attaccato alla play, ti sei scordato chi sei?
Ho una fattanza bluray, fumo e vedo oltre i miei limiti
Consenti? en plein! sono io nella tua testa in replay

Salmo,"Brah
Ah yeah yeah, Machete flow, Lebon, Cyberpunkers

Dio mi parla nel sonno dice ""dividi le masse"" 
Conquista la folla come Russel Crow 
Fatti una doccia di merda da queste casse 
Dimmi hai mai sentito del Machete Flow? 

Salgo sul palco con il mitragliatore shu    ??
Proiettato come Shakur 
Girava voce che son morto in tour 
La fama distruttiva tipo Sex Pistols 
La truffa più bella dopo quella di cristo 
Parlami all'orecchio buono, ricordami quale sono 
In mezzo a questi timorati in fila per il perdono 
Di 'sti tempi non avere fede è un dono 
La chiesa è come un cult, l'assassino è sempre il maggiordomo 
Tu mi capisci bene, in pratica sai come sono 
Ti giuro salgo in macchina e non so mai dove suono 
Lasciami quindici fottuti minuti da solo 
Nell'anonimato il contrario di Andy Warhol 
Hai notato come tutto è cambiato più o meno 
Se hai talento nel canto non c'andare a Sanremo 
Per mano di qualcuno esposto agli scandali 
Ci troveremo a trent'anni gonfi di psicofarmaci 

Dio mi parla nel sonno dice ""dividi le masse"" 
Conquista la folla come Russel Crow 
Fatti una doccia di merda da queste casse 
Dimmi hai mai sentito del Machete Flow?

Per dirti quanto è inutile andare in un talent show 
Si potrebbe chiamarla per nome (come?)
Machete Flow

Ah, scrivilo sui Twitter, qui per 
Un posto comodo si strappano la pelle come Jeepers Creepers 
Salmo gente iper, al mio concerto non portarti tuo padre, tua madre, la babysitter 
Tua figlia quando canta è una gallina 
Si è fatta i capelli fluo (fluo) 
Con la vicina ha fatto un duo 
Sogna tra le stelle del pop 
Carichiamo questa troia sulla via del talent show 
Siamo in cerca di attenzioni 
Spesso chi le trova finisce a fare i conti 
Con un Amore e Psiche come Canova 
Se la fama ti ingoia fai sì che il nome tuo 
Ricordi sempre il presente anche dopo che tiri le cuoia 
La situazione odierna è che 
Siamo freddi dietro schermate con meno contatto della scherma, e se
Ti addormenti tra le mani della folla 
Ti regalano il successo e quando succede giù crolla 

Dio mi parla nel sonno dice ""dividi le masse"" 
Conquista la folla come Russel Crow

Salmo,"Se tu fossi me, saresti come loro
No no, nel senso come gli altri
Finiresti per spiarmi da un foro nudo mentre indosso questi panni per lavoro
Giuro, sono un disoccupato nei suoi anni d'oro
E il futuro è solo opaco, lasciato in segreteria
""Play"", farei la fila dei problemi giusto per dire la mia
Dovrei bruciare tutti i miei vestiti
Scendere in strada come i travestiti
Godermi lo spettacolo alla fine del mondo, ci siamo divertiti
Ma dai! Non può piovere per sempre meteoriti
Non ho bisogno di muovermi, perché sai, magari
Da fermo viaggio in tutto il globo come Salgari
Ho il rap multitasking e skills palmari
Quest'erba mette in silenzio in macchina, un safari in bocca
Tocca a me parlarti, incantarti
Dirti che i sacrifici pagano in contanti
Questa generazione non crede ai politici o ai Santi
Credono soltanto ai cantanti

Potresti dirmi che sapore ha leccarsi le ferite
Puoi fermarmi come il sangue che espelli
Ora più che mai riconosci il nome
Se non capisci, vai, ti faccio uno spelling (Salmo)
S-A-L-M-O-O-O-O
Se tu fossi me
S-A-L-M-O-O-O-O
Se tu fossi me

Se tu fossi me, faresti come tanti
Scriveremmo i nostri nomi sugli specchi
E se, lo faremo con la punta dei diamanti
È per sentirci importanti quando saremo vecchi
Ma sai che me ne fotte a me dei soldi?
Io ho solo due motivi e credimi, gli unici
Il primo è sopravvivere ancora nei tuoi ricordi
Il secondo è vedervi qui sotto con gli occhi lucidi
Incontrarci a mezz'aria se qualcosa va storto
O sono l'aria oppure sono morto (oppure)
Oppure è la mia stanza che varia e mi fa dormire storto
Svegliarmi col fiato corto e il tuo fiato sul collo
Perché il paese è vacuo
Tagliano i ponti ma sbagliano
Cammineremo sulle acque con Dynamo
Verso il nulla come i cani che abbaiano
Sono felice solo ora che sanguino

Potresti dirmi che sapore ha leccarsi le ferite
Puoi fermarmi come il sangue che espelli
Ora più che mai riconosci il nome

S-A-L-M-O-O-O-O
Se tu fossi me

Dietro vetri oscurati e spessi
Volti trascurati, soli depressi
Tristemente scritto dagli stessi
Amici trasparenti nel conflitto d'interessi
Odio le culture in musica
Come che andate in giro nudi sotto la tunica
Epico il destino, tu mi sa non sai suonare
La tua tipa ha il culo a mandolino
Non eri tu quello che giudica
Un bacio a tutti come Giuda
Vivi nella paura
Vedi Massoni nel Triangolo delle Bermuda
Sento canzoni crepuscolari, Neruda
Se crepo, scusa, il sacrificio chiede carne cruda
Senza pelle nuda, come Dio ti vuole
Sangue freddo come rettili al sole
Tu dimmi quando e dove
Ti dico quanto e come

Salmo,"Con questa boccia di vodka potrei ballare samba
Soffio nel palloncino, la festa dei caramba
Apro il portabagagli
A saperlo ci mettevo un serpente a sonagli
Un black mamba
Aggiornati sui termini chiede se ho bamba
Sembri un tipo apposto, un tipo in gamba
Insomma
Non sono mica un terrorista, anche se in tasca ho una bomba
Fate turni di ronda
Sono sbirri in giro, è notte fonda
Vuole levarmi la patente per mezza bionda
Chiede quale è il mio mestiere (il musicista)
Ride come fosse un dovere (oh!)
E allora sono un anticonformista
E in due sere
Lo stipendio di un carabiniere e di un finanziere, messi insieme! (ah, ah!)
Puoi prestarmi il cappello che poi
Ho bisogno della fiamma per accendermi il joint

Apro la busta perché
Ho saputo da maria che ""c'è posta per me""
Potresti rovinarmi e mandarmi in clinica
Levarmi l'appetito e la fame chimica
Fumo sali da bagno, almeno così
Vengo a mangiarti la faccia come eugene (eugene)
Per voi è routine
Fammi sta perquisa
Quando fumo mi trasformo in un mostro come arisa

Sto fuori di qui in 36 secondi
Fai sparire il corpo del morto prima che torni
Pri, prima che me lo scordi
Se mi hai dato del venduto allora dove cazzo sono i miei soldi
Più che altro guarda in quale stato mi sono conciato
Faccio fatture regalo soldi allo stato
Le mie paure hanno sempre un rimedio
Scriverle é un esempio
Buttartele in faccia e sentirmi meglio
Pensano che ora cago i soldi, ma chi?
I rumeni fanno più cash di me alle slot machine!

Sono sempre uguale, stessa fame
Mettimi il fiocchetto, resto sempre un cane

A metà tra mainstream e underground

Scivolo sui gossip, skater, dogtown
Mando knock-out
Haters never log out
Mi sa che vogliono un leader
Uno per tutti, tutti per uno e nessuno che si uccide
Chi muore non decide
Ho un piano infallibile per l’italiani
Puliamoci il culo e baciamo le mani

Lord come byron

Fasciati la testa perché quando accendo il mic ti spengo

Mi stringi la mano e poi fai l'infame

Io con sta merda mi guadagno il pane
Tu sei solo un tossico in giro col cane
Stai abbaiando per paura
Non ti piglio per il culo, ci ha pensato la natura! 

Credimi è una cultura che adesso non c'è
Sai perchè? E' stata uccisa dalla gente come te (come te! )
Che fa la stessa merda da dieci anni
Mettiti una corda al collo e dopo faccio bungee jumping! 
Tu sul beat inciampi, è un guaio
Ti blocco la mascella come un tiro di taglio
Dritto assetto diretto, al tappeto
Sei vecchio da quanto ti sento dormo col secchio affianco al letto! 

Dio, posto mio, meritato
Te non sei la vecchia scuola zio, ti hanno rimandato
Bocciato! mi tocca fare la predica, fare sta merda per me è una passeggiata di domenica! 
Metti il vestito buono, quello preferito
Fatti una sfilata sul tappeto del fallito
Non muori mai ma non sei leggenda
Io ti conosco, tu sei come gianni, un mangia merda

Perdete tempo nel dissing, siamo king come gipsy
Slait fa girare dischi più dei frisbee
Messo a testa in giù come bottiglie di whisky
Siete anonimi alcolisti
Machete empire state of mind, lebon selfmade
Tu sul tempo sei passato, stargate
Manda a casa one take frà
Non te la prendere, è solo lo stupido gioco del rap

Amo così tanto me stesso
Che per segarmi ho preso una camera d'albergo

Finchè li quotano in borsa
Fino a farmi così ricco
Che mi verrà l'R moscia
Marra non è tipo che puoi dissare per farti un po' di promo facile
Sulla carriera tua metto una lapide
Grossa come una fottuta piramide
Con la tua origine
Se fossi in te e mi ascoltassi
Pure io mi direi ""di che parli?""
Due giorni con me
Che poi cambi colore
Come fa lo yacht di cavalli
Son passato dal commercio in camera
Alla camera di commercio
Dal non farti più vedere in centro
Al ""prego ritorni presto""
La guardi e pensi ""ma chi è?""

Sono l'otto Marzo, tu il due novembre
Ridi, cazzo, che era divertente
Questo rapper che pretende?
Che lo prendo pure seriamente
Sono grandi cazzi
Ieri ho esagerato come il Grande Gatsby
Con una carriera che fa grandi sbalzi
Stalli pazzi e grandi balzi avanti
Come te la vivi, penso male
Questa scena bidimensionale
Sono qui per ridimensionare
Fuori da ogni crisi personale
Oh, guarda ho nove gambe di giacca
Sette di jeans e quattro di t-shirt, vedi
Quante gambe che ho addosso, frà
Sono un cazzo di millepiedi (ah)

A volte esagero (ah)
Accomodati prego
Mi serviva una casa grande per il mio ego
A volte esagero (ah)
Sto comodo dì dietro
Se vado in giro con un Hammer guida il mio ego
A volte esagero (ah)
A volte esagero ma
Se devo dirtelo in tutta sincerità
A volte esagero ma
A volte esagero, nah
Non siamo così lontani dalla realtà

Ok

Scusa le volte che esagero
È come quando metti la bocca da papero
E dopo l'autoscatto, chiedi consiglio
Dicono sei babbo anche senza un figlio
Vesti leopardato
Voglio dedicarti i versi che ho imparato
Non vorresti ma lo pensi ritardato
Non è che sei sfigato, ad Edoardo Bendato
Ogni volta che voglio morire
Mi sento depresso
Mi chiami: do buca
Richiami
Ogni volta mi guardo allo specchio mi tocco le palle
Pensando a Gianluca (Grignani) Grignani, Grignani
Ogni volta mi guardo allo specchio mi tocco le palle
Pensando che alle volte esagero
Dissaputo, frate' sei come se mi dissa Pluto
L'ultimo rimasto inevoluto
Sei il figlio che Vasco non ha mai voluto
Pensi che sia impazzito
Un'amico immaginario ripete ""sta zitto""
Almeno scrivi una canzone per un partito
Ma da un po' che sono già partito
Dormo vestito, colpa dell'erba mi buco la felpa, è una vita di merda
Dico sorridi, brindiamo a noi tristi
Il boss della major non vende più dischi
Selfmade, yes mate, tutto fatto in casa tipo sextape
Per questa non serve il translate
La tua tipa manifesta al trans day
Sono avvilito, impallinato, impallidito
Mai avuto un alibino adibito
Il mic che registra è allibito
Lebon è come Alain Delon del Rap
Pardone moi
Sta volta mi sa che ho esagerato (brah)

A volte esagero (ah)
Accomodati prego
Mi serviva una casa grande per il mio ego
A volte esagero (ah)
Sto comodo dì dietro
Se vado in giro con un Hammer guida il mio ego
A volte esagero (ah)
A volte esagero ma
Se devo dirtelo in tutta sincerità
A volte esagero ma
A volte esagero, nah
Non siamo così lontani dalla realtà

Vengo al mondo d’estate 
Dio mi parla nel sonno 
Mi dice “scusi, quanto state?” 
Ho il permesso di soggiorno 
Sono nuovo da queste parti 
Parto ma non so se torno 
Non stare sveglio ad aspettarmi 

Questo è l'anno dei miracoli 
Craxi mangia coi tentacoli 
Muore Berlinguer 
Maradona è al Napoli 
Io sempre col pallone in mano 
Sette su sette 
Piedi nudi sull’asfalto fra le vie strette 
L’anno in cui la Apple prova 
Il primo Mac, Crystal Ball 
Crystal meth vado sulle croci tipo Cristotech 
Cozze crude col limone dinastia di pescatori 
Mio padre non fa il buttafuori ma ti pesta fuori 
Rinchiusi dentro il bunker a fumarle tutte 
Niente router, no computer 
Pezzi di ricambio per gli scooter 
Fermo il tempo che scorre, con quel sole risorge 
Soffio sull’occhio di George Orwell 
I primi drin Fossil solo film sui mostri 
Le prime donne stuprate da Bill Cosby 
Cresco in fretta, parlo poco, sembro autistico 
L’arte è cibo per la mente, frequento l’artistico 
Se il treno passerà una volta sola, sarò di parola 
Dopo scuola lascerò il mio nome sopra con il viola 
E tu che aspetti in coda e guardi la firma se cola 
Mi hai visto nascere e morire per rifarlo ancora 
Olbia city, motorino sempre in due 
Poi la vita è diventata più veloce: ognuno per le sue 
È una gara senza freni, non ci sono premi 
Dove cazzo vai se non sai da dove vieni

No-me, no-me, no-me, no-me 
Ah! ora tutti sanno il no-me, no-me, no-me 
Oh, ora tutti sanno il no-me, no-me, no-me
Oh, ora tutti sanno il no-me, no-me, no-me

Coprimi di soldi Jerry Maguire 
È quello che hai pensato quando eri nei guai 
Voglio portarti via con me tipo Macdrive 
Back in the days bra Marty Macfly

La mia zona era la z b, heavy metal kids 
La versione beta dell’MC
Ho fatto i peggiori lavori per ripagarmi i CD 
Sognando un futuro migliore, tipo questo qui
In 5 sul Volkswagen dell’Ottantaquattro verso Londra 
È un po’ come nuotare verso l’onda 
Sono affogato e poi resuscitato sulla sponda insomma 
Ho perso quando ho fatto a pugni contro l’ombra 
Dalle esperienze impari, spali merda a quintali 
E anche se mi spari, c'ho la pelle come i cinghiali 
Sardo come Zedda Piras ho fatto il viaggio in ketamina 
Adesso riempio i locali e parcheggio in terza fila 
Sapere che il mio primo disco 
Ha fatto la storia ma dopo il Sangue Misto 
Ancora scioccato per quanto sangue ho visto 
Il mio flow vi ha benedetto, il sangue di cristo 
2012 alla svolta 
Machete crew guarda le spalle tipo la scorta 
Capo come John Gotti, sveglio tutte le notti 
Vivevo in una casa con il bagno di Trainspotting 
Poi la mia passione è diventata professione 
Devozione, mani intrecciate come alla confessione 
Ringrazierò la sorte per gentile concessione 
È importante ciò che lasci, non la conclusione

Ora tutti sanno il no-me, no-me, no-me 
Ah! ora tutti sanno il no-me, no-me, no-me 
Ah, ora tutti sanno il no-me

Salmo,"Milano sotto zero, anche stanotte ha dato neve
Sto al binario zero, l’inferno è la via più breve
Sorridere, mentire e dire di stare bene come dire è per sempre ma alla fine non staremo insieme

Se ne dicono di cose in giro, ti prendono in giro, di prendere un giro, fammi fare un altro giro
Di notte per le strade come un comune vampiro, super-io, super-hero
Spesso qui chi gratta il fondo ha il naso del tapiro
Io che in fondo chiedo scusa, puoi levarmi la paura, lasciarmi il respiro
Quanto alcool è passato sotto questi ponti
Il mondo esploderà fra due secondi, non saremo pronti!
Chiedilo a Shazam chi è Salmonlebon
Non sono un tipo da champagne e Dom Perignon
Vengo a sfondarti il club, le console, i deejay, se ci sei leva un posto a reggaeton
Sfidi la gravità quando le sfili Wonder-Bra, a volte è meglio non vedere come Stewie Wonder, Brah
Odio le tipe col berretto, risparmiami il balletto, sulle tue labbra ci balbetto
Tipe gessate coi corpi ingessati, mostri truccati con fidanzati su Monster Ducati
Viscidi unagi, mangia-uramaki
Salmo squarta gli apparati, ti appende al muro tipo carta da parati
Da ragazzino giocavo coi Lego, stacco pezzi e ricollego
Grazie al rap adesso gioco un po’ con l’ego

Ai se eu te pego, ai se eu te pego, uccido rapper quindi avanti un altro, prego!
Rap stratego, non mi espongo lo fa l’alter-ego
Attacca sempre al collo quando slego
Ai se eu te pego, ai se eu te pego, uccido rapper quindi avanti un altro

Striscio le mattine come clochard alle panchine, niente rose, dammi le cartine sputapalline
Arkanoid, fai una Polaroid, facce bianche paranoid, a una certa parlo come Freud
Da sano problemi sociali chiuso tipo coi domiciliari
Guardo le stelle sdraiato sui binari
Sembriamo uguali come fosse comune, che i locali come questo sono fosse comune
Pieno di VIP, io non sono un VIP
Sono solo un mostro quando accendo il mic, quindi via da qui
E falla ‘sta foto di gruppo, io me ne fotto di brutto
Hai perso la ragione perché dopo le cinque so tutto
Le mani strette sul tessuto, c’ho la stoffa del sopravvissuto
Ogni strofa sette vite che ho vissuto
Uccido rapper, rimo sette stelle come Hokuto
Faccio sette di mattina ma non centra l’occulto
Finisce sempre sul più bello quando",7 AM,2016
Salmo,"Ah, a noi ci va così, così bene
Che non so che cosa dire
Tu diresti c'est la vie, ah
Ma stai bene? hai mai visto un'alba così?

Ti guardo ed è già Halloween, non è che c'hai un Aulin
Lo vedi ho preso il volo come un fottuto monaco Shaolin
Nei testi cito sempre Dio, scusami se insisto
Ma mi chiamo Salmo, e faccio rap di Cristo
Quando non c'era l'iPhone, l'alba senza il filtro
Somigliava a Zion, le scritte in un dipinto
Ma dicono che il sole, non abbia più un amico
Perchè quando sali su, io sono già sparito
No ma dimmi se c'è un altro posto del genere, (eh, eh)
Ma dimmi se c'è un altro posto del genere (eh, eh) e non credere
Chiedi alla polvere prima che diventi cenere
Per quanto tempo ti devi nascondere dietro le tenebre

A noi ci va così, così bene
Che non so che cosa dire
Tu diresti c'est la vie, ah
Ma stai bene? hai mai visto un'alba così?

Ah, off-topic
Vedo i mostri come a Milwaukee
Occhi grandi come telescopi
Con quella faccia come te le scopi?
Se questa è la fine, è la fine dei giochi
Il sole è per pochi
Cammino come Dead Man Walkin'
Quando non c'era l'iPhone
L'alba senza il filtro, somigliava a

Salmo,"Sei pronta? Andiamo

Vestita come a Capodanno, 3-6-5 l'anno
Noi come Bonnie e Clyde penso che ci uccideranno
Un fiore al camposanto ferma nel suo caposaldo
Non vuole un principe ma un re, qui il capo è Salmo
Sono passati anni, quando da casa dei suoi
È scappata, l'ho trovata nuda su Playboy
Ehi boy, giocava sopra le mie spalle, senza le mutande
Diventerò una stella quando sarò grande
Ordina Franciacorta, s'aggiusta la frangia storta
Morde quando ha fame, ha la faccia da gattamorta
In ginocchio da una vita, ma adesso sta un po' seduta
Ha il diavolo dentro e spesso vuole essere posseduta
Mi incanta vederla ballare nuda
Senza un tatuaggio pelle scura
Mentre fuma fa contrasto con la luna
Odia se la chiami baby, ti guarda e poi le cadi ai piedi
Ha gli occhi della tigre come Kabir Bedi

Ingoia il mondo quando lei apre le gambe
Ogni uomo dovrebbe starle distante
Vuole mangiarti il conto in banca
Lasciarti in mutande
50 fottute sfumature di sangue
Noi per l'amore siam conigli, my darling
Se per favore avrai consigli, mai darli
Siamo pietre fra i diamanti, bugiardi come amanti
Ti chiamerò più tardi e fingerò di amarti
Yeeah, ahh 
Yeeah, ahh
Yeeah, ahh
Yeeah, ahh

Nessuno è più al sicuro, il male nel suo fare incerto
Dice che il futuro è un tale morto in mare aperto
É così figa che ti giuro le vuoi dare cento
Ha un culo monumentale dovrebbe stare in centro
Non apre mai la bocca, solo quando fa una botta
Mezzanotte scocca, Cenerentola fa la mignotta
Serate Love Boat, d'estate sugli yacht
Solo per uno slot, scoperebbe Super Sloth
Così materialista, punge a chi ha le vene in vista
Ha l'arte dell'inganno e il talento da mentalista
Mangia una volta al giorno, vomita tre volte al giorno
Sai di questo passo non resta manco il ricordo
Striscia fra i serpenti con lei non ti senti friendly
Siamo solo scheletri riflessi sopra le sue lenti Fendi
Sono a casa Wendy, andrà tutto liscio come il Brandy
Sei così bella quando mi smembri

Ingoia il mondo quando lei apre le gambe
Ogni uomo dovrebbe starle distante
Vuole mangiarti il conto in banca
Lasciarti in mutande

Vai più veloce, più veloce, vai più veloce
Testa a testa con la sorte
Su questa moneta c'è due volte la croce!

Il gioco comincia da qui, eh
La gara è truccata lo sanno chi vince
Se la vita è come un film sono Fincher
All'ultima fila con l'occhio di lince
Ho un motore da ippodromo
Schiaccio il pedale, i finestrini implodono
Premo il tasto rosso qui si mette male
Pensa cosa posso fare col microfono?
Cowboy dall'inferno, quando scrivi sul tempo vivi in eterno
È come stare in grembo al padre eterno
Sopra un'altalena appesa all'ultimo perno
Corro al buio delle eclissi, dagli abissi
Come il verme del whisky
Non sento più la faccia tipo lifting

Hai preso lo sciroppo contro il catar

Contapasso, giro col walkman
Ti sorpasso e vedo Paul Walker
Muori precoce, ma da icona
Qui la vita è più veloce, Daytona
Non sei il più forte con i cerchi croma
La strada porta a me come se cerchi Roma
Fuori in 60 secondi, chi va più veloce moltiplica i soldi
È l'ultimo giro il finale lo sai
I buoni non vincono mai!

Un po' come quei giorni che mi vesto da coglione come Johnny Depp
Mi preparo per il gran galà
Entro col casquet come la Carrà

Pietrifico cachet come Jerry Calà

Ti trovo più bella ma a fine serata
Vedo come Capitan Harlock
Fumo, se mi capita parlo
Buongiorno, sono già cortese
Preghi San Gennaro? Sono giapponese!
È una vita che adoro starvi lontano e restare da solo
Ecco perché quando viene giù il sole
Metto di notte gli occhiali da solo
E so che dovrei fare due passi alla Drake
Invece mi chiami Mandrake
Perché sono un mago e vi mando in vacanza sul lago se recco le strofe in un take
Vamos a la playa, come i Righeira
La musica si spoglia già la prima sera
Mi consuma sotto le lenzuola in primavera
Questa maschera non mi nasconde, mi rivela
Non ballo come Michael, Lebon Simon
Love is in the air con in mano il Baygon
Psycho, una vita eremita
Ho la testa ferita, scusa ma la festa è finita

Rimo e sbanco il botteghino, quindi alzate il vino
Sabato sabato, esco di casa con il bavaglino
Vi beccherei in giornate, coglioni girati
Due giorni contati, e conti aggiornati
Questa scena è un Valtur, fai la manicure
Vai per primo tu che per secondo doi frittur
Detta l'ignoranza, mangio tutti questi avanzi
Ho fatto cose che meglio non raccontare ai pranzi
Sbocchi sul patè, la mia crew è cruditè
Udite udite, non sento parlare più di te
Con il mic in mano guerre puniche
Non bastano tre teste cubiche per queste sudice

Chi mangia dal tuo piatto dorme sempre a pancia piena
Nessuno mai si è ricordato di invitarti a cena

Ostriche di Calavera in tavola ceri e candela
Cala la sera faccio vibrare i bicchieri di Adele

Non vi sopporto come i Coldplay
Imparruccati cosplay, acchittano una raglia con la Postepay 
Ventaglio verde come i veri Dei
Tu stai in rosso Eric Draven, posso mi presento tipo ""germi miei""
Colletti bianchi più di Dino Erre
Il più pulito arriva primo, merde
Sputo diamanti perché rimo perle
Voglio la pelle nera come Nino Ferrer
Viviamo tra gli inchiostri, col fegato Bukowski
Balliamo sporchi dopo l'alba, diventiamo mostri
Odio la polo Lacoste quindi prego si accosti

Vengo dal 1400, anticristo

Fai due passi avanti, uno indietro
Due passi avanti, uno indietro
Due passi avanti
C'è differenza tra quello che ascolti e quello che fai
Tu dici quello che senti ma non quello che sai
Come d'estate col maglione in pile
Come vestirmi bene, fare un giro in casa, non uscire mai
Sono eccitato al nostro addio perchè il tutto è crudele
Ho mai cantato amore mio col fottuto ukulele
Resto qui tutte le sere coi polsi in catene
Ho smesso di volare quando ho imparato a cadere
Qui non serve un miracolo, non serve l'oracolo
Non serve una croce, non serve il pentacolo

Essere vecchio a vent'anni morire solo
Potrei fare il buono, andare in tutte le radio a fare la promo
Non capisci me, non capisco loro
Mi chiedi il feat per il tuo disco, disco d'oro! 
Tocca stare sotto la pioggia è costante ti occorre un cappotto
Tutto ciò che tocco diventa un diamante da esporre in salotto
E il cielo non è il limite, io non ho una canzone in testa la mia è orribile
Cerchi me trovi Osiride, posso ritornare in vita risalendo le rapide
Potrei fare shopping
Buste grosse come borse, Mary Poppins
Potrei fare jogging tutto fatto come Janis Joplin

Oh, potrei stare nudo tutto il santo giorno 
Sotto la vestaglia tipo attore porno 
Mi sa che anche stanotte faccio mezzogiorno 
Mi sveglierò in salotto con le tigri da soggiorno 
Ho visto tutto Narcos e ho i baffi come Pablo 
In pochi sanno che il mio vero nome è Santiago 
Ho più fucili di Chirac e Chicago 
Ed ad ogni mio nemico gli apro il cranio e ci cago 
Potrei fare più grano

Mentre gli altri insultano 
Compro casa a Lugano 
E giro il cash come involtini 
Con la faccia da ruffiano e i risvoltini 
Per strada fanno fuoco 
In giro è coprifuoco 
I pacchi con la spunta sotto 
Brah ti do una punta in loco 
Il mio cliente zoppo senza un occhio 
Braccio monco, parla poco 
Dice solo ""I'm in love with the Coco!"" 
Lancio il sasso tipo Morra 
Faccio questa vita perchè la mia serie preferita è Gomorra 
Il cattivo preferito prende forma 
Metto soldi nel soffitto e perdo chili, peso forma 
Quando tutto cambia, come cambia il vento 
C'è chi costruisce muri, chi mulini a vento 
Ma io sarò più svelto puoi credermi 
Il mio nome è Medellín 
Don Medellín
Don Medellín 
Don Medellín
Don, Don, Medellín
Don, Don Medellín

Dancing with the Devil
Day and nights are slow
So don't be in vain
We're high before the show
And I look like an angel
But I don't have a soul
Singing with the devil
And my life says ""let go""

Stivali el charro 
Il capo del barrio 
Ho una taglia sulla testa tipo El Mayo 
Dovresti farmi santo per quante volte appaio e scompaio 
El Diablo muove chili al dettaglio 
Lingotti bianchi fanno castelli 
Muovo un impero con i carrelli 
Faremo un party con i cartelli 
Dalle mie parti sparano sui cartelli 
Quando tutto cambia, come cambia il vento 
C'è chi costruisce muri e chi mulini a vento 
Ma io sarò più svelto, brah credimi 
Il mio nome è Medellín 
Don Medellín
Sotto questa pioggia col cappotto nero 
Brillo perchè ho fatto il botto nel mercato nero 
Sto a cavallo come i Mescaleros 
Senza vie come gli eretici 
Io sono Dio, credici 
E la mia benedizione è un M16 
E pah! Faccio fuori questi infami 
Ho un esercito di colombiani 
Con cui mi esercito a tagliare mani 
Sangue sul Cartier 
Valigetta e jet privée 
Vino e cruditè 
Sento certe voci su di me
Dicono che guardo troppi film? 
Troppe serie alla TV? 
Hah! Ma sai che me ne sbatte brah, io sono Medellín 
Don Medellín

Dancing with the Devil
Day and nights are slow
So don't be in vain
We're high before the show
And I look like an angel

Ehi 3 Mob, Mob, ehi, Mob
Ehi, Mob, Mob, Mob, okay

‘Sta giacca non è mia, come Don Pietro
Tuo figlio è in oratorio con il don dietro
I frà dicono è Zzala infatti non nego
Firmo zeta sulla porta come don Diego (Fuego)
Non ho perso la fame e spero che ti basti
Ma per fare ‘sto salto frà ci salto i pasti
Esce ‘sto disco, tanti auguri e figli maschi
Mi sembri appena nato perché pigli schiaffi
Hey, bello il disco, tieni il mongolino
Fai il G ma sei un orsacchiotto, Coccolino
Faccio serate tipo che non torno vivo
Col flow ti sputo in culo tipo pornodivo
Freschezza, frà lavato Perlana
Co ‘sta tipa sdraiata già lavata per l’anal
Non metterti con me perché non ti conviene
Non dico quasi niente, ma lo dico bene

Non fotti col Mob
Mob mob mob mob
Mob mob mob mob
Mob mob mob mob
Tre tre mob mob mob

Yeah, è un altro giorno, mi alzo e corro, karma storto
Punto tutto su me stesso quando gioco al Fantamorto
Sono un film sulla felicità con una trama dark
Come se stai all’Acquapark e senti urlare “Allah u Akbar”
Stringo i denti tra macelli e cazzi vari
Tra fratelli marginali con cervelli immaginari
Per me sali sul palco e lì riveli quanto vali
Sennò sembri il primo maschio con problemi vaginali, adieu
‘Sta vita me la fotto in fretta
Quindi tengo sempre il Settebello sotto il sotto sella
Tu ancora ti stupisci che nessuno ti comprenda
Se fai dischi mentre ti pulisci il culo con la merda
Sono leggenda come B. B. King
Mi riprendono in canotta mentre mi faccio una botta
Sul CD di Skin, in onda sulla BBC
Ops, l’ho fatto un’altra volta come Britney Spears
Sono l’MVP, la “next big thing”, epic win
Che sia rap, che sia trap, che sia classic shit
Piscio sul tuo corpo morto, auguri e rest in “piss”
Sepolto nel mio armadio tra i miei vecchi baggy jeans

Mic check, platino sul disco bruh, Hellvisback
Dici che ti piace il rap, ti consiglio Nek
Sei così lario, dovresti chiamarti Ilario
Si chiaro, per fermarmi chiama un buon sicario
Non ho la stecca ma un bazooka, mando l’otto in buca
Piscio sulle scarpe nuove di zecca e buco la tuta
Il vomito sulla felpa, è colpa della Sambuca
Ma vivo alla svelta, ciò che non mi uccide me lo suca
Col flow c’ho l’impennata, in motorino
La tua tipa laringoiatra, otorino
Il mondo è mio a modo mio quando rimo figlio mio
Son tuo padre quindi non chiamarmi zio
Vacci liscio come il Gin, leggi nella bio
Che non sono James Dean, frà sono James Dio
Ho il suono sadomaso tipo palle in bocca
La mia gente non ti fa la pelle, ma la pelle d’oca
Stendo il red carpet, sono Fred Carpet
Non vedi sto Zalando ti faccio le scarpe
Siete bambini dentro un impero di carte
Se piango e mi dispero faccio un tour su Marte
Tuo figlio non mi sente, intuisce
So che è intelligente, le capisce

It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart

Am I too late to make amends?

Even told the golden best of you

This life is in and out of meaning
Not looking for nothing
Only see it how we see it
Living words
Television, air bending the definition of quality living
Shape shifting, better plains of existence
Enter this dimension by the words of the sentence
Willpowered by real power
Creation be the sorcerer
Alchemist, hidden in the shadows of the orchestra
Struck by the extension of I as creator
Slayer and saviour
Leader and player
Player hater, how you unworthy of the presence
Infold or bow to the essence
Bend to the blessings or die by the weapons of creation
Visions by the seekers of the nation
Spit this vibration
Spread him through the depths of the darkness
The nucleus of all that evolves
Warriors, for the war we win
All the way to the way of the wind
The illusion is in

It is he that holds the key to places heaven and hell
When all hell breaks loose, the heavens prevail
Water signs and stars aligning, I just sat in a cell
40 acres and a donkey, I'm a pin on the tail
You done followed me and my mind but who are you in the shadows?
Speaking shallow, hallow's prepping evil plans in the gallows
Centred in the desert lies an oasis and swims a tadpole
Oh now you're creeping out the backdoor, devil use an asshole
You've casted me away from my temple, plain and simple
Popping quizzes worse than pimples, far from gentle
I'm a man, I'm a sinner
Oh Lord forgive me, forgive us
This world is fading, it's crippled
Draw up the contract in the stipulation
When it's storms, I'm receiving precipitation
I'm told my name's linked to foul litigations and hatred
I'm the hierophant, holy sacred
Last release your least favourite
My ancestors stare inside of me for rivalry, the native
A pope, they label me the only hope
What happens when a demon meets the one and only G.O.A.T

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Que tus padres no me quieren a mí
Que a ellos no les gusta que yo sea para ti

Es que este amor no se acaba, ni se puede confundir
Te quiero seriamente, para compartir

Porque eres una chica diferente, a esas que andan por ahí
Soy estudiante de los buenos y tambien tengo porvenir

Recuerdo el día en que te acercaste a mí
Sentía que me iba a morir

Yo por siempre voy a luchar mi niña

Y lucharé por mantener este amor

I'm charged with cosmic energy
Has the world gone mad or is it me?

I'm the creator of this universe

But i don't sweat it because it's just pathetic to let it,
Get me involved in that he said she said crowd.
I know that ain't nobody perfect, i give props to those who deserve it,
And believe me ya'll he's worth it.

Dissin' all of the opposition 
MCs  it's my butt you're kissin' 
Because I desire 

Yo  wait a minute  chill  I want ya all to hear 
Why rap is not a joke  for us it's a career 
Others try to imitate but none has come near 
So you see why everybody stands up and cheer 
And if you really think about it you know what it means 
To be a female rapper from the heart of Queens 
And see others dream about being supreme 
But once on the scene we start killing kings 
People claim we're too wild to tame 
On stage we behave like sizzlin' flame 
And oh, so cool when we rap you need a sweater 
The rhymes so tough you swear they're made of leather 
Get the best of your bunch, and I bet that we're better 
Tell 'em why, Pepa, tell 'em why - 'cause I desire 

DJs come and go just like the wind 
But mine is better than all of them 
She's sharper than a razor when it comes to a cut 
More lethal than a laser if you want to play rough 
Not the object of a show, subject to cut ???? 
????? tell you Spinderella's dope 

Call her Spin for short but she don't take ???? 
want to duel? You're a fool ???? 
Choppin' beats for these until the turntables bleed 
Scratches so damn hard you'd swear the mixer had fleas 
She's the mutilator, music carnivore 
Spinderella rocks the records with a chainsaw 
You're still amazed by the way she plays 
Not a fad but a phase of the hip-hop craze which I desire 

Salt from the Pepa and my name is Cher 
From Queens, New York not Delaware 
I like my steak well-done 'cause I hate it rare 
And I'm lovable and huggable like Yogi the Bear 

Pepa from the Salt so do not rip 
'Cause if you do I'll shift from first to fifth 
Lights out, it's heard, I thought you were dead 
Short, fading went I went upside your head 
So get back to the beat 'cause the beat is bad 
The beat pro and the bass gets much impact 
The beats rock and just because the beat kicks bass 
We're gonna bounce this beat all over the place 'cause I desire 

While you're on the set let the cameras roll 
Salt and Pepa are the stars, the world's the video 
Your room is boomin' when we're on your stereo 
So hold on tight, don't dare let go 
We're the teachers, you're the students - class is in session 

Pay attention boys and girls, and learn your lesson 
We're running things, yes, we're taking over 
You be the grass, we'll be the lawnmower 
Never fakin' or takin', not givin' no slack 
Not trying, succeeding 'cause it's like that 
Hot damn, how could you be so doggone dumb? 
Trying to dis Salt and Pepa when we're number one? 
But we excuse you 'cause you're dippy, your mind's in a daze 
Like every duck you're confused in so many ways 
Giving nothing, taking all whether big or small 

We got a ? beat and it's dope, def y'all

So get out my face before I smack you 
Ho  don't you know? Can't you understand? 
If you mess with me I'll take you man 

Well I'll take your man right out the box 
And put him under my padlocks 
So when you see us together chillin' in the place 
Cold walkin' and sportin' him in your face 
Go ahead roll your eyes  suck your teeth 
Keep huffin' and puffin' like a dog in heat 
You can call me a crook, a robber, a thief 
But I'll be your butcher if you got beef 
You know what's up - I ain't no poo-putt 
'Cause Pepa kick butts off dumb, young bucks like you 
And the rest of your crew 

If moms want static I'll dis her, too 
So scram you know who I am 
Damn, chick, don't play me, punk 'cause I'll take your man 

I'll take your man whenever I feel like it 
This ain't a threat or a bet, it's a damn promise 
From me to you, your sex life's through 
If you get another lover, I'll take him, too 
All I have to do is say a rhyme or two 
And he'll hop and leave you like a kangaroo 
I'll make him heel for me even steal for me 
His mother and father he'd kill for me 
That's what you get for trying to play smart

Either give him up or get slammed - I'll take your man 







I'll take your man, that's right but just for spite 



Because you tried to dis me when I was on the mic 



But I really don't want him, the guy ain't fly, shoot 



He can't afford to buy a Fila suit 



Runs the same old gear, never has fresh wear 



What he whispered in my ear I can't repeat here 



I don't want to seem to be so damn mean 



But you're the hippiest critter I ever seen 



Before I got on the stage you wished me good luck

I'll take your man anytime, at the drop of a dime

Everywhere I turn, everywhere I look 



The brother's eyein' me down, he's staring down my throat 



But he's a ducker sucker, soft-hearted punk 



Goin' skiing for skeezers, stunts for blunt 



So that's why y'all have so many things in common 



Him for just robbin', you for lap slobbin' 



I never ever went out my way to get played 



Keeping guys like yours held down at bay 



You know I can, I got the upper-hand 



Tramp, you don't stand a chance 'cause I'll take your man 







Most girls have guys that's good to go 



But yours is slow - he's a freakin' a-hole 



The fact still stands, there's no change in plans

But I'll tell you this: Don't try to answer this jam

Are you ready
To rock y'all, to the beat y'all?
A-keep on and you don't stop
Rockin' on, keep rockin' on

I'm the queen on the mic and it's true when I say that
The Pepa MC is here to stay and you know
If I was a book I would sell
'Cause every curve on my body got a story to tell, yeah
Word 'em up, w-word 'em up 'cause
I'm so fly, nobody can deny
The girl hasn't been born that can deal with I
Me, Sandy D., undoubtably def
Don't need to be dressed, I'm fresh to the flesh
Yes, so tough you know it is a must
Now Salt, get on the mic, and tell 'em why you go crush

'Cause I'm oh-aye, I'm on, I'm on
Yes I'm oh-aye, I'm so damn on
Like a grasshopper hoppin' on the morning lawn
Like a needle on a record when it plays a song
Like Little Boy Blue blowin' on his horn
And you know I got to be on
Mcs rockin' and shockin', but it won't last
Salt's on the mic, and I'm kickin', ask
Me no questions, I'll tell no lies
It's just a little warning, a word to the wise
You been hopin' and scopin', layin' and prayin'
But on the bottom is where you're staying

You're wack, I thought you understood
You're not related to me so you could never be good
I know you come from Babylon (And you know why?)
'Cause you're a Babble-On MC (That's right)
You babble on the microphone about what you wish
But could never be, so please
Don't tell me how you're gonna rock
Don't brag about the things that you ain't got
Don't feed me lies 'cause now I'm full
My cow just died, I don't need your bull

Yo, yo, turn my mic up a little bit
One, two, one, two, alright, thanks

My mic sound nice, check one
My mic sound nice, check two
My mic sound nice, check three

Right about now as you can see
In the place to be
We're not talking about geometry
History or biology
So Sandy D. explained it to me
Why do they call you the Pepa MC?
You mean you don't know? Uh-uh that's a shame
OK Salt, let me explain

I'm hot like a fire, burned down, diminished
Oh, now I see! Chill, let me finish
I wanna make one and all understand
I don't play, I slay when the mic's in my hand
The room temperature reaches a hundred and four
You can scramble eggs on the floor
The pressure soars, the crowd, they roar
Sweat will drip down to your drawers
The Pepa MC is like hot ice
And I paid the price to make the mic sound nice

Forget about the rest, yes, I don't jest
You're blessed with one of America's best
So I think y'all better count your blessings
When Salt's in the house, hell's in session
It's a fact that I will wax
Mcs out there are gonna get taxed
Rockin' to my funky beat
I'm a trip so I know you're gonna fall for me
'Cause this is the year all men fear
Female MCs is movin' up here

It's just a little somethin' too hot to be missed, girl 



I was going downtown (???), serious 



Cher took the train home from work 



Pissed off because of a stain on my shirt 



The train made a stop (Where?) Two hundred and five 



And a little soft guy walked inside 







He wore plastic Bally's and a booty Gucci suit 



Cracked a little smile and showed a fake gold tooth 



Was he cute? Negative, he was a dupe

I started to cuss and began to swear 



He said, ""Listen girl, I like the way you comb your hair 



And I like the stylish clothes you wear 



Is there something that I can do 



To show how much I really care? 



Like when I'm all alone with you

And you put that fire inside of me 



That shows it's more than just a dream 



And I like it, and I like it"" 



I said, ""Please, don't get excited!"" 







Don't you know I'm too young for you, mister? 



Sally from the Valley - she's my sister 



And that lady you dissed - that was my mother 



You hurt two of my family, you won't get another

He wanted to explain, explain to me why

Sally died when she hit the concrete"" 



He said, ""Come on, you're puttin' me on"" 



As I got up to walk he sang this song:

Don't take this a simple rhyme

Now what would you do if a stranger said hi?
Would you dis him or would you reply?
If you answer there is a chance
That you'd become a victim of circumstance
Am I right, fellas? Tell the truth
Or else I'm-a have to show and prove
You are what you are, I am what I am
It just so happens that most men are

Have you ever seen a dude who's stupid and rude?
Whenever he's around he dogs your mood
I know a guy like that, girl
He thinks he's God's gift to the world
You know that kind, excited all the time
With nothing but sex on the mind
I'm no stunt, on me he can't front
I know the real deal, I know what they want
It's me (Why?) Because I'm so sexy
It's me (What?) Don't touch my body! (Boy!)
'Cause you see I ain't no skeezer
But on a real tip I think he's a

On the first date he thought I was a dummy
He had the nerve to tell me he loved me
But of course, I knew it was a lie, y'all
He undressed me with his eyeballs
Trying to change the whole subject
'Cause everything he said pertained to sex
So I dissed him, I said, ""You's a sucker!
Get your dirty mind out the gutter
You ain't gettin' paid, you ain't knockin' boots
You ain't treating me like no prostitute""

You came in here so you cannot avoid it 
This beat is hard  it's as hard as atomic energy 
Thinkin' as long as we're rhymin' to it 
And it's addictive like smoking 
Word to the parents, see, I'm not jokin' 
You'd be a thief only this life is harmless 
Couldn't kick the habit if you tried your darndest 
So don't fight it, don't fear it 
Just take your hands, applause and cheer it 
I gave you more than you ever expected 
And when I did then you gave me respect 
With your support we're reachin' new heights 
Salt and Pepa's insanely hyped on the mic 

My supporters are massive, my sound is passive 
If I was you, I'd take time to ask if 
Others you've heard really deserve to be ranked as the best 
Great or supurb, to be or not to be, that's a good question 
How good they used to be, well I give less than a damn 
'cause the present day counts if you can't rock a tone 
I suggest you just count 
I said please, but it's not like I'm pleadin' 
So don't get supe, peasant, stop speedin' 
'cause I'm about to rain, and when I rain I don't drizzle 
It's gettin' hot in here, we're gonna sizzle 
See, I understand that you had the dishes 
But if it's too hot, get out of the kitchen 
'cause frauds and fakes are the ones I don't like 
And they are the ones that get me hyped on the mic 

I'm gonna play you for keeps, got a system in my teeth 
Outside on the street people heard all of the beats 
That I rapped or mastered so throw the wax on 
Pepa is that strong, they can hear the last song 
First class status, I'm a blessed event 
God rocked the full-size for my silhoutte 
Yes, solo this woman, rise all before me 
??? jump on it 
Don't try to be 'cause I will protest 
Oh yes, I have an uzi I've been dyin' to test 
Livin' larger than life but to be precise 
I'm Pepa, much deffer when I'm crazy hyped on the mic 

We're gonna break it down to you how it should be broke 
Rhymes written not ? and how it should be wrote 
People jammin' not standin' and what you hope 
A show funky not junky, you say rhymes are dope 
??? he'd be madly hyped 
Spinderella had to tell him, ""Boy, you ain't my type"" 
Get away from her, I tell you before she gets pissed 
She's got a left with a cut, and it'll go like this 

Started wheelin' doin' wheelies, but you were a big wheel 
Started dealin' like a dealer, but you just couldn't deal 
As you flip like a freak the whole world just flopped 
Couldn't rock like a rocker so you just got rocked 
I'm the defest gettin' deffer and ought to be kept 
Take a breath between rhymes with a bet, tell 'em Pep 
Or let's kick it like a kicker, the rhymes I kick 
Like a sticker gets stuck to your butt I'll stick

c'mon  let's go!] 







All you cats in the back if you ain't wack 



If you're on the side flygirls and guys 



All the people in the middle when Spin drops the needle 



If there's moneymakers in the front  you know what I want 







I went to a party the other day around the way 



With my partner  her name P E P A 



We were dressed to kill  ready and willin' to make a killin' 



Met Spinderella at the door, what was she doin' Salt? Chillin' 



We walked inside a man asked the three for ID 



When he found out who we was he said, ""Go ahead girls, y'all can go in free 



The drinks are on the house, anything you want is yours"" 



Then he gave us the keys to the V.I.P. doors 



I said... 







CHORUS 



""Hey, you, I like it like that!"" 



Hey, you, I like it like this 



If I had a wish before I die 



I'd like to have it like this for the rest of my life 







Chillin' at the bar drinking Moet and caviar 



People pointin' at us 'cause they know who we are 



Word had gotten around that S-N-P was in the place 



Now they gathered around to get a little taste 



""Yo, please, baby, please, I want to hear you MC"" 



Is what this guy and his friend had said to Pepa and me 



Although we tried to resist, but then I said, ""Hey, what's the use? 



One song won't hurt, and besides, his friend is cute"" 



Spindy got on a set, handed a mic to me and Pep 



Then we started to rhyme, and I'm sure you know the rest 



They said... 







CHORUS 







It feels good when people are on it, don't it? You know it does 



Being treated like a queen on any scene just like we was 



Call it juice, call it jocks, whatever it is I know it rocks 



Till you sweat me and expect me to like it a lot 



And say... 







CHORUS 







[Yo, what are you doin'? 



Put the beat back on 



c'mon, stop playin' around Hurb! 



Yeah, boy, you know...you know we need some (bass!) 



Yeah, it's chill now 



It's ok, now let it play so we can say...]

Salt-N-Pepa,"I'm Salt here to resource so start steppin' 
When me and my homegirl Pepa start pepperin' 
Try and dis the girls  try to stand tall shorty 
The girls got naughty   we went Top Forty 
Call in the troops  we're comin' out blazin' 
Ill if you will there ain't no savin' 
The queens have been ordained 
You can't play me boy  I'm no game 

It takes two to dance so c'mon let's tango 
Us on the mics and y'all on the dance floor 
It's a Salt and Pepa affair, yeah 
Never ever no static, beats will come out clear 
Title after title we take 
Rack 'em up we're gonna tally 'em 
And when we're done you're gonna need a valium 
To calm your nerves, after I bomb your nerves 
The quiet comes after the storm is heard 
And I'm stormin' long and strong, I can't go wrong 
Watch me get into this rap song 
Like a river I flow into the mic I'll blow 
Make sure it's on as Spinderella drops the beats so",A Salt With a Deadly Pepa,1988
Salt-N-Pepa,"Pep had to step  she'll be back in a sec 
But in the meantime  I like to have sound check 

One two's what I say as the record gets played 


For a little bit to make sure it stays on track 



The wax can't be scratched unless Spin is there 



So she can catch it on time so then I can rhyme 



The vocalist on the mic is me 







I'm the short and sexy one in effect 



About to bring it to you straight up, wait up 



You ready? Huh, it's time to pay up 



The capital S gonna spot 



I'm here to wreck shop [Salt, where's Pepa?] 



Yo, she's at the next stop 



So all aboard, grab a seat and get set 



Spinderella, start it up, now let's check 



Overdrive, rhyme after rhyme, I'm still the best 



I'm holdin' down camp keepin' punks in check 



So snap out of it, me the soloist for what? 



Salt and Pepa with mics, Spinderella with cuts 



Let's get paid, get paid 







Yeah, comin' in and goin' in, growin' in and throwin' in 



We got the flavor, and everyday we're showin' it 



So just stay back 'cause Salt ain't takin' no fronts 



'cause I'm dope, I look good, and I'm paid to be blunt 



Reigning supreme, all hail the queens from Queens 



You think it's def now? Wait till Pepa steps on the scene 



So petty rappers take a seat, make sure you sit up straight 



The name Salt and Pepa, the year '88 



Let's get paid, get paid 







Doin' the chores on behalf of my partner 



Like money in the bank so thanks, now I'm a spark of the ashes 



Strike the match, light the fuse 



Spinderella, me, and Pep singing the Get Paid blues 



To the petty I'm like a machete making confetti 



'cause you don't see Pepa, punk, step up, you still ain't ready 



You want a piece of what the Salt releases? 



Take a chunk, punk, and now you're leaving in pieces 







Step left, jet poo-putt-putt in your Nova 



Before you thought, think again, you won't get over 



With a clover, four-leaf, chief, to be brief 



Yo, Pepa hurry up and come and get a piece of this mic 



'cause I'm hoggin' it, Holmes start loggin' it 



They want to know do I rock? Salt be doggin' it 



Shakin' and bakin' the mic just like a chef 



I'll rock this beat until there ain't none left 



Let's get paid, get paid 



Let's get paid, get paid 







If I run out of breath, I take a pause 



If Pepa's on stage I say ""Go for yours"" 



But if she ain't then this mic I'm minin' 



I say ""Spin, drop it"" and keep rhymin' 



When Pepa comes back she'll say ""Salt, chill"" 



Grab the mic, and go for the kill 



But you're lucky 'cause she ain't back yet 



Relax, men, you're a nervous wreck 



Wipe the sweat off your face and stop panickin' 



You look scared, stiff as a manequin 



But still you're back again to see me rap again 



Spin, cut the final hit, let's just pack 'em in 



Cuff 'em and stuff 'em, they know I still love 'em 



If they can't stand the heat well then chuck 'em

Salt-N-Pepa,"As I was way in the back I noticed that 



Salt was rockin' the hell out of some of you cats

Just wait for the drumroll then you can feel the flow of

Salt-N-Pepa,"When the needle's picked up the volume's kicked up 
She's gonna fix up anything that's mixed up 
When the record gets cut the crowd is lift up 
You might think it is but... 

[Chorus:] 
Spinderella's not a fella what you say? 
Spinderella's not a fella that's ok 
Spinderella's not a fella watch her play 
Spinderella's not a fella but a girl DJ 

Spins you won't get 
And flip the vocal style, rip the instrumental 
Nice on a slice, swift on a mix 
Those who dis will then be dismissed 
Like a fever she'll heat up, burn, and feed her 
If you can't put up then shut the hell up 
All you mixmasters and cutmasters 
True grandmasters even jammasters 
Listen to what I'm sayin' on the mic 
She's hard as a man, too sexy for a dyke 
So let your ears hear what your mind can't conceive 
Got a cut for your butt on the mix why'all she's no joke 
With the microphone you're toast 
Get ya hyped and excite, mysterious as a ghost 
Check the style plus the swiftness 
Don't take my word for it, you be the witness 
No one lies when the truth is starin' them in the mouth 
The needle won't stick, it's the record they hug 
No alibis 'cause the proof is in the puddin' 
Mistakes on hip-hop breaks? She's just wouldn't 
Make believe what she can do indeed 
You're dealing with the Queen of Speed 
Cuttin' the beats with ease, makin' the record bleed 
Now then, you know what I mean... 

[Chorus:]
 
She's the inch long on the mixboard 
Put your tape on pause and press record 
Never does the same cut twice in one night 
She'll go solo toe-to-toe like a vice 
Grip the turntable and flip the record over 
Heat up the party like a supernova 
Because it's a girl don't mean jack 
If Jill tried to get ill, she'd get slapped 
Want to know her name and why she came? 
Not to cause trouble but to entertain 
I'm-a tell ya don't mistake her for a fella 
The mix empress...Spinderella! 

Yeah, that's her title 
The God of Speed is her DJ idol 
Cuttin' like a maniac, clever as a brainiac 
Only when the scene's packed will she react to 
Anyone who dares to compare 
The comp will be too much too bear 
But this chick is big on tricks 
With her wrist she'll flip within a spilt 
Second, she's flexin' and checkin' 
The level of the power meter will not be less than 
Ten degrees, her sound won't distort 
Mixin' ain't a job to her it's a sport 
When the turntable speaks, take your advice 
My homegirl is nicer than nice 
She's a ?, a slave to the rhythm 
If the crowd wants action then she'll give 'em 
More than they can handle, this ain't a scandal 
If the mix is mangled she'll untangle 
It with a scratch on it, ain't that a bit? 
The way she can switch from groove to groove 
With no room to improve [yeah, I'm telling you] 

[Chorus:]
 
Cuts are made to be played not fade 
Spin won't behave if she ain't paid 
To get down, no let down 
Put your bets down and just check how 
She moves with the grace of a cat being pat 
The wax hits hard as a bat 
Automated just like automation 
Imitation causes irritation 
You owe it to yourself to see her 
Go backstage and meet her 
Get her autograph, take a photograph 
I know that's too much to ask 
Word, but don't give up hope 
Spinderella's not a fella, Spinderella's dope 

[Chorus:]",Spinderella's Not a Fella (But a Girl D.J.),1988
Salt-N-Pepa,"You said it loud, and I heard you
Never tried to hurt you
Some say I'm old-fashioned
I like to take my time and do it slow
You know with the flow
But don't try to rush it
So ride it like a horse
And let nature take its course
Get to know each other
Be my friend not just my lover
Share your thoughts with me
Love my mind not just my body, baby

[Chorus]
Do you really want me, baby? Let me know
'Cause if you really like me I suggest you tell me so
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came
'Cause I may be the kind of guy you like

Please understand the way I feel
I must have trust or there's no deal
My emotion's ain't to be
Played with or given free
I appreciate greatly
The way you tolerated me
Sometimes I do act flaky
I wouldn't blame you if you hate me
You put up with my butt
When I wouldn't give it up
Yeah, I know that really sucks
But if you wait awhile, I'll make it up

[Chorus]

Who me? A tease? Brother, please
You're just having bad memories
About some skeeze who did the squeeze
And had you on your hands and knees
Look, I am telling you straight out
That's not what I'm all about
I'd just be playing myself out
If I spent the night at your house
Now don't get me wrong
I didn't mean to turn you on
We haven't known each other long
But this is my life not just a song

You want to step to me, groove me
I know you want to do me
Come on now, fellas, don't fight

At my door they're bum-rushin'
To hear the percussion
Sound of my go-go band
I've long ago learned my lesson
It's all about expression
Will the real Salt and Pepa please stand?

We had magic now ya lost without the love wizard
Ya had to cross me, and now you lost me
Get off me softy, I'm the boss, see?
You can't disguise the lies in your eyes, you're not a heart breaker

Get with this independent funk

You're a baby so maybe you just needed a babysitter
Bitter? I figure I'm rid of a piece of litter
Tiger, tigger, I bounce back, and you're a quitter
Your girl is gone for good so just forget her
You're blind, you'll never find another better
Your mind stays on a behind in a tight sweater
Burned your flowers and your love letters
Never a tear will I shed
I'm independent

Yes, I am independent

Hot to trot, make any man's eyes pop
She use what she got to get whatever she don't got
Fellas drool like fools, but then again they're only human
The chick was a hit because her body was boomin'
Gold, pearls, rubies, crazy diamonds
Nothin' she ever wore was ever common
Her dates heads of state, men of taste
Lawyers, doctors, no one was too great for her to get with
Or even mess with, the Prez she says was next on her list
And believe me, you, it's as good as true
There ain't a man alive that she couldn't get next to
She had it all in the bag so she should have been glad
But she was mad and sad and feelin' bad
Thinkin' about the things that she never had
No love, just sex, followed next with a check and a note
That last night was dope
 
Let's talk about sex, baby (sing it)
Let's talk about you and me (sing it, sing it)
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex (come on)
Let's talk about sex (do it)
Let's talk about sex (uh-huh)
Let's talk about sex
 
Ladies, all the ladies, louder now, help me out
Come on, all the ladies - let's talk about sex, all right

I even got gold on my teeth (So what?) 
You a tramp (Please...)] 

Home girls attention you must pay 
So listen close to what I say 
Don't take this a simple rhyme 
'Cause this type of thing happens all the time 

Now what would you do if a stranger said hi? 
Would you dis him or would you reply? 
If you answer there is a chance 
That you'd become a victim of circumstance 

Am I right, fellas? Tell the truth 
Or else I'm-a have to show and prove 
You are what you are, I am what I am 
It just so happens that most men are...

[Yeah, I'll be your tramp (Please...)] 
Have you ever seen a dude who's stupid and rude? 
Whenever he's around he dogs your mood 

I know a guy like that, girl 
He thinks he's God's gift to the world 
You know that kind, excited all the time 
With nothing but sex on the mind 

I'm no stunt, on me he can't front 
I know the real deal, I know what they want 
It's me (Why?) Because I'm so sexy 
It's me (What?) Don't touch my body! (Boy!)

Don't waste my time] 

On the first date he thought I was a dummy 
He had the nerve to tell me he loved me 
But of course, I knew it was a lie, why'all

'cause everything he said pertained to sex 
So I dissed him, I said, ""You's a sucker!

You ain't treating me like no prostitute""

Salt-N-Pepa,"Magic, I'd like to send this one out to the partner
Pepa MC, magic, and her first born, whatever it may be, magic
Yo Spin, once again help me get this crowd on it's feet

So we can set it off, I've got your back, Salt
You know I'm never soft, yo where's your records at?
Right beside me, ready to give a scratch? Yep, like poison ivy

It's the nineties, the year for change, can you prove it?
I made this beat, I'm an invincible and I produced it
It's in my soul to roll and flow, take control
Sold the show, can go like a pogo stick

Hot hit, dop, dip, rock, rip, don't shop on my hit list
'Cuz I can be a witch if, they say music is cool
And it can calm the savage beast
Then we got plenty of beats for the beasts to eat

A party animal that's livin' rather large, in fact
Take out the camera, Salt, why? I wanna picture that
Make sure it's focused or you may only not have noticed
Before I cut up a jam I yell a 'Hocus Pocus'

And right before your eyes you'll understand the name
Musicians and magicians are usually the same
And the fame, proclaim, obtains the stain, will gain a rain
That pours, it soars my brain to yours

Ordained by law to train the poor
I'll make sure that there ain't gonna be no more
It's a treachery hidden up the sleeves of men
Magic will only work for those who do believe in them

Black magic, it's black magic, do you believe in black magic?
It's black magic, I believe in black magic, it's black magic
Do you believe in black magic? It's black magic, I believe in

We call this song 'Black Magic' 'cuz it's a fact
Anything that's tragic relates to black
Coincidental? No, here's an example, Jack
Words as ancient as fossils or artifacts

Black Sunday or Monday, black tongues or lungs
May 'cause a black sleep, why say black sheep?
Black Sabbath is evil, black market illegal
A black widow is deadly, black potion ain't healthy

See, some try to say dark skinned men ain't sexy, true
Darker the cherry, you know how sweet will be the juice
Music's the only thing that brings the dead right back to life
Have faith and it will guide you through the night just like a light

Never say Salt steered you wrong inside a concert hall
My crystal ball can see the future, to the beat y'all

Magic, it's black magic, do you believe in magic? It's black magic
I believe in magic, it's black magic, do you believe in magic?
It's black magic, I believe in magic

And my feet in the street is black magic
And my soul in control is black magic
And the life that I live is black magic
Anything that I give is black magic

It's black magic, do you believe in magic?
It's black magic, I believe in

In magic, a dimension of sight and sound
Where people see in only shades of brown
And reality is the same as a fantasy
Is this the way you want your world to be?

Not me, I want variety in my society
Where I can change if I don't like what I see, you see
This is a woman speakin', bringin' door-to-door, seekin'
Tranquility, that ability will keep on repeatin'

To saw someone in half may be a trick or treat
Makin' them dance and laugh is somethin' quite unique
Abracadabra, Salt's comin' at ya
You say my music was a phase, a fad, huh

I proved you wrong, over ten years and still goin' strong
Whoever heard of a fad kickin' for so long?

Magic, it's black magic, do you believe in magic? It's black magic
I believe in magic, it's black magic, do you believe in magic?
It's black magic, I believe in black magic

And the life that I live is black magic

Salt-N-Pepa,"I'm a sister with a grip on her life 
I only live once so I gotta get right 
The first time 'cause there won't be a second 
I'm not in the mood to preach about the wrong of the world 
It can't be changed by three girls 
On the trio tip we're not a proof of that trip 
Excuses that's the truth when the proof compellin' 
I ain't tellin' or sellin' out to the pop life 
I like the spotlight 
Gimme a mic and a beat so I can speak words of wisdom 
I may be young, feed some, fall down, and filled up, I'm gonna build up 
Knowledge is food for thought so let's eat up 
Whatever goes up, comes down, you see nothin' lasts forever 
Not even MCs, you, he, she, and even I should live and let live 
Or live and let die 

Live and let die 
You're wastin' time tryin' to change the mind 
Of those who's souls are full of holes 
I do unto others as I wish them to do unto me 
Life ain't nothin' but death without money 
My way of thinkin' is one-track 
My method of convincin' combat 
Success is a mission, it's there for anyone who wants to do better 
You know where I'm comin' from 
Survival of the fittest, and I'll admit it's vicious 
I testify as a witness 
Let me say this first for what it's worth 
It's true that the meek shall inherit the earth 
But that don't mean you gotta be weak or soft 
Even on the mic you can't take no shorts 
I only help those who want to help themselves if no one else 
As a youngster they taught me to live and let live 
And that's what I always did, word to miz 
But there's a change in the world that I live in 
So don't be surprised if I live and let die 

Live and let die 
Live and let die 

That's the eighth time that baser almost O.D.'d, man 
Live and let die

Live and let die

I don't know - you say you like me
So what's up?  You know what I'm sayin'?

Yes  yes  y'all 
Salt and Pepa's here with a brand new call 
People are saying  ""No  it just can't be them"" 
But yes  it's Salt and Pepa on the mic again 

Here to let you know how the rhymes just go 
When it's time to pick up the microphone 
And let the voice flow 
So yo  Steevee O  let the beat go 
Whether it's fast or slow or medium tempo 
No one can ever flow smooth as this 
Whether he's a Mister or she's a Miss 
So come one, come all, ya gotta bust a sound 
Or rather the rhyme will just gather around 
To see the doper than dope ones, fulfill the circumference 
Go out and buy an amp so that you can pump this 

It's startin' to irk me, yo, Salt, what irks you? 
Other MCs couldn't fill up a circle with fans 
While we were on vacation you couldn't complete your end 
Salt and Pepa now we're back and again featuring 
Spinderella, she's not a fella but a pro 
And on the wheels of steel good to go 
Cuttin' up a storm sometimes it's frightning 
First comes the rain then strike the lightning 
Doper than dope, can anyone cope? 
Yes, a-maybe, ahh - nope, so why do you persist and try? 
Look me right in the eye and tell me are you that fly? 
That you can pick up the microphone 
We stake the mic alone 
Hope that you never run into Salt and Pepa 
'cause we're doper than dope 

Yo, it's been a long time, but now we're back 
Salt and Pepa's gettin' funky on a brand new track 
And more up-to-par, swift like a car 
Stickin' to your mouth like rooftop tar 
Leaving a scar on those who spar 
So pass the cigar, get a drink from the bar 
Lyrics gonna flood your mind like the reservoir 
Here they are, come and join the Salt and Pepa seminar 
The rhymes are refined, some call them bizarre 
But they can catch your ears like a bass guitar 
And speakin' of base, why did ya in the first place? 
Walkin' around town till I see you face to face 
You didn't want to speak so I rested my case 
And now you're feelin' kinda fragile like an antique vase 
But don't worry friends or even give up hope 
'cause this time we're hyper than hype on the mic 
Call us doper than dope 

Spinderella, where ya at? 
Give us a funky scratch 
This is it, this is it 
Gettin' doper than doper than dope can get 
Uh, hit me 
Two times 

Three-two-one break down, ya broke up 
'cause you started speakin' when you shouldn't have spoke up 
You went the wrong way, you shouldn't have tried 
To dis Salt and Pepa 'cause half-steppers gettin' fried 
'cause these females at five minutes a beat 
Is all it takes for us to take control seven days a week 
You're wack, stick to your skeezin' please 
And let's not waste time on the weak MCs 
'cause they're unreal, and we're the real deal 
'cause we reveal the real sex appeal 

Yo, fellas, you want some, come and get some 
Doper than dope rhymes so I can hit some 
Musical notes that can hypnotize 
Keep your eyes on the lips, hips, and thighs 
Try to concentrate on the whole scenery 
'cause this is Salt and the Pepa MC 
Yo, here to rock right with the Idolmakers clan 
There's Steevee-O, Hurby the Luv Bug and also 
The Invincibles, Fat Doug, Dre, and Bougie 
And much more so get your VCR and pick my Fuji tape 
And rush for your house, don't move slow 
'cause you might miss the main Idols in the video 
You guessed it, yes, it's no joke 
Salt and Pepa's on the mic gettin' (what?) 
Gettin' doper than doper than doper than dope 

Enough (Why?), 'cause this ain't your average stuff 
And when it comes to rockin' rhymes Salt and Pepa don't bluff 
We were the Showstoppers that took your men 
We made you shake it then you push it, and we started a trend 
But this trend is kinda different, it's not a gold rope 
This time it's Salt and Pepa, Spinderella gettin' doper than dope

Salt-N-Pepa,"Here we go, I'm a Negro with an ego
(Yo)
So, don't tell me what I'm doin' is illegal
No, I resort to violence only when provoked
Contrary to rumors I'm no joke

If I sound hard it's because I'm peed off
And do you wanna know why? Go 'head tell 'em Salt
All right, let me explain what upset me
No we ain't tryin' to be sexy

Dismiss is quick with a miss like a tongue
'Cuz I'd run if I was a chick
Pick up a hit list
And I'm-a kick it like this

The word is out, you played me out
I won't scream and shout, straighten it out now
Don't lie and spy, stop tryin' to connive me
Slow your roll, you don't even know me

I'm not a militant but I'm equivalent
To an activist, all I'm after is cheer among all
I don't care if they're big or small, short or tall
We've got to stand to fall, ain't that right, y'all?

Now all I can talk about is what I know
And all I know about is what I witness
What I witness is what I see
Me, way below status quo 'cuz I'm a Negro with an ego
Yo, that don't go

Put some faith in your race
Put some faith in your race
Put some faith in your race
Put some faith in your race

I'm black and I'm proud to be a
African-American Soul Sister
Usin' my mind as a weapon, a lethal injection
And oh yes, I'm the best in whatever I do

I do better, I'm clever
I never half-step ask Salt or Pepa
We're partners in rhyme, one of a kind
This affair is rare and you will never find
Another like me, gimme the mic, it's mine

Keep your mitts off this, yo, Salt, it's time
To let the public know the subject of the show
Is what America calls a Negro with an ego
Yo, that don't go, that's a negative so

Put some faith in your race
Put some faith in your race
Put some faith in your race
Put some faith in your race

Porche, Benz and BM's are all suitable
For people who sell pharmaceutical
That's a stereotype, that's the hype
Don't ask me why I have an attitude
(All right)

When I drop a nine-eleven on my 200C
The cops are surprised to see, a minority
Behind the wheel of this car, it must be narcotics
How else could she have got it?

A brown-skinned female with two problems to correct
Wrong color, wrong sex
Sometimes I feel the real deal is to be a rebel
But that would bring me down to their level

I won't settle for that, it's unacceptable
'Cuz Salt-N-Pepa's always very respectable
Sometimes we get crazy and outta hand
But it's all in the fun of makin' everybody dance

I'm proud of
Who and what I am
So call me a Negro with an ego
And get ready to go blow for blow

Put some faith in your race
Put some faith in your race
Put some faith in your race
Put some faith in your race

Faith, faith
Faith, faith
Faith, faith

Salt-N-Pepa,"I'm gettin' dressed for the jam about to jump in my Mercedes 

Slippin' on my dancin' shoes 'cause I'm a lady of the eighties 

It's Friday night  I just got paid  my house is pumpin' 

Or listenin' to my Hammer tape  while my sound system is dumpin' 

Picked up my girl Salty  she was waitin' on the porch 

I shared my fly  fly Mercedes  yo  lit the highway like a torch 

On the way to pick up Spindy we raced with a 1 9 D 

He was a sucker duck if he thought he could buck with us in E 

The party started 



CHORUS 

Let's get this party started 

Let's get this party started right 



Rolled up at the party, saw a fella black and fine 

Bow-legged, high-top fade, then I said, ""Yo, that one's mine"" 

Stepped out of the ride, told the bouncer, ""Hold my Benzy"" 

Heard the bass, it was the place so I slipped my man a penny 

When we walked in the jam fans met us at the door 

They yelled, ""We love you Salt and Pepa!"" ""Yes, we love y'all even more!"" 

Some foul, wack, nappy bitty tried to step to Spinderella 

I was cool, I made my move, then I droppped her like a fella 

Start the party, boy 



CHORUS 



Now this is what you call a hip-hop beat from S and P 

So get out on the dancefloor, and don't even rough with me 

I ain't goin' for it, I ain't buyin' it so don't even try me 

Dance sucker, Mother Tucker can, that old lady gets busy 

Yeah, I don't give a damn, Salty is who I am 

And man, I'm gonna slam this jam, you understand? 

Yes, we will stay the queens no matter what the means 

The party started, let's get retarded, now work them bluejeans 

Rock the party, y'all 



CHORUS 



[Yo, Salt, you want to continue the story?] 

Yes, I told the people move, he made a move 

To the stage and grabbed the mic 

From these stank, sorry, frauds - Run D.M.C. look-alikes 

Spinderella took the set, made her fingers nice and wet 

And you bet she made that DJ sweat, and he won't soon forget 

Pepa took on the speaker, bust an oh, so funky rhyme 

I did a step right on time and made the crowd lose their minds 

The whole place was on the floor, we was rockin' hardcore-core 

We left them wantin' more, and we headed out the door 

We rocked the party

Salt-N-Pepa,"The duo is back  competition check out the new style 
Then get the heck out 
Put on your battlin' gear  but don't come strapped 
Bullets are not needed  this time it's rap for rap 
I'm makin' the move  and soon you'll have to make yours back 
In fact  the further the rhyme is dancin'  Jack will get a lip smack 
So break up because it's time you shook up  you gotta make up 
It's time to break up the party  now you're shook up 
Salt and Pepa's gettin' swift, livin' up to par 
And competition, how to ""Whassup"" is to ride the bra strap 
Hurby's on the beats, Steevee-O has the musical notes 
Spinderella's like a propeller spinnin' music so dope 
Makin' a lot of noise for all the boys shootin' the gift 
Hold on tight 'cause tonight Salt and Pepa's gettin' swift 

You might have thought about goin' against the spices 
Salt and Pepa's a mixture like Chinese rices 
Battlin' time, Mr. Macho, please don't try to rip 
Because I'll melt ya like Nacho cheese 
You want flavor, well here's something to savor 
Why don't you wave a microphone in front of my face 
And a do small favor, gimme a beat so I can bust a rhyme 
For all the nerds, let all the words feed your mind 
Statin' the things and pleasin', takin' a rest, I'm out for easin' 
Bodily functions makin' 'em dance and Pep, this is the Christmas season 
This is duck season, and I'm gettin' high 
You're outta luck, duck, now it's time for you to get and die 
The ebony queens are back on the scene 
I assume you still suck like a vacuum machine 
Cornball sucker, give me a break 
I'm-a drop you from the sky like snow, you a cornflake 
Born to break any sucker or half-stepper 
Who wants to get assaulted with a deadly pepper 
Go down, low-down, this ain't no showdown 
The competition, I'm sure they'll blow down 
Even if you seem to stand stiff 
The breeze of the rhyme makes you move, and we get swift 

Suckers and flukes, it seems you lost and time to put up dukes 
'Cause you just forced it, the furious females to fly to (fuck) with 
Stay stiff suckers, soon you'll be stuck with a rep, torn to shreds 
A musical score leg, need a victory? I left an 'S' on your forehead 
Don't fuse up now, it's time to put out lights 
I won't ease up, pal, 'cause I'm-a go outta sight 
Lyrical queen, mess around, and you'll get creamed 
The star of every male's fantasy or wetdream 
The ebony princess in a lyrical safari 

Battlin' me is like a Honda racing a Ferrari 
If you were the king, what laws would you have me obey? 
None, my son, 'cause I'm quicker than a ??? 
Quick to split the chick tryin' to get slick 
You're nothing but a prostitute turning a new trick 
Little Miss Wench, my mind is a trench 
Makes you drop, then you stop in your tracks and as I clench 
My fist, I twist words you use to rip 
The next time you flex, I'm guaranteed to get swift 

Hip-hopper's, rap artists, and rhyme fanatics 
Can you believe there's a sucker trying to cause static? 
Break out the health supplies and medical aid 
Prepare your mind for a super, alphabetical raid 
Rhythmic explosion without corrosion 
Rhymes, in effect, that protect like a Trojan 
Against disease, sorta like a wack MC 
Rhymes more powerful than a punch at Jack Dempsy 
I fear no one, plus I tell no tales 

I will stand up to any male or female 
Ones who persist to resist end up a prisoner 
Hissed in a daze or a faze because he is in a 
State of shock, too hard for one to take 
So in a multitude of crowds I run to break 
Beats for torture, but don't get played 
I stay paid, I caught ya now you shook, you're afraid 
Scared of the fact we came back to uplift 
The name, we designed the game, and we get swift",Swift,1990

Shows that you got a lot to offer

What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man

I want to take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's, he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cause we got through the past
I finally found someone that can make me laugh
You so crazy, I think I want to have your baby

What a mighty good man

My man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me every time I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God sent original, the man of my dreams

Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Tryin' to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac shit
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me 'cause good men are hard to find

What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
Say it again y'all
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
I said what a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man

My man gives real loving that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a nucca out
Don't take him for a sucker 'cause that's what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cause his mama taught him that

I got a good man
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
A mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
What a man, what a man, what a man,

I wasn't tryin' to be a hooker sellin' pootang 
Up and down the block just ain't my thang 
I seen a lot of women fall and gettin' fast money 
Cause either AIDS or jail will get that ass, honey 
I needed more to explore so I tried rap 
Now in 1993, I'm livin' mack stack 
Check my attitude it comes with the territory, baby 
And now I'm drivin' niggas crazy 

[Chorus]

Everybody wants to get paid, paid like a Lou Mays 
Poppin' that coochie or sellin' fake Guccis 
Whatever's in style and costs some big ? 
Just to get one, niggas get a real five 
It's all about the great paper chase 
A million dollars worth of whip appeal could even buy Babyface 
So read me all the rules so I can have my money right 
Cause I'm a new lady boss keepin' game tight 

So, you think you're all that, feelin' kinda phat 
But can you see where the wrong is? 
I, I don't know much about ya 
But there's no doubt you're out to get yours anyway you can 

[Chorus] 

[You know what? I can't stand them Salt-N-Pepa bitches 
They think they're all that 'cause they're popular in Europe 
Yeah, probably sell-out hookers 
Oh, oh, and they swear everybody want to be like them 
Please, I don't want to be like them bitches 
I know, I live in a big house and have all them bills and headaches and stuff 
Oh, and Spinderella 
Nah, nah, nah, she's cool, it's them other bitches I can't stand 

(So I'm a bitch now?) 
Oh, Sue, there they go, right there Salt, Pepa! 
(Sometimes I be buggin' because I'm rich now) 
Yo, Pepa, can I get your autograph for my son? 
(Well, I don't need nothin' 'cause you know that I'm a bitch, y'all) 
Yo, y'all's hair is real fly, where'd ya all get your hair done at? 
(You say, ""oh, ain't she somethin'"" because I'm rich now 
And I'll bet you want to be like me) 
Still can't stand them bitches

Salt-N-Pepa,"What's the matter with your life?
Why you gotta mess with mine?
Don't keep sweatin' what I do
'Cause I'm gonna be just fine check it out

If I want to take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business
And she want to be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It's none of your business

Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm givin' skins to
It's none of your business
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time
It's none of your business

Now who do you think you are
Puttin' your cheap two cents in?
Don't you got nothin' to do
Than worry 'bout my friends? Check it

I can't do nothin', girl, without somebody buggin'
I used to think that it was me, but now I see it wasn't
They told me to change, they called me names, and so I popped one
Opinion's are like assholes and everybody's got one
I never put my nose where I'm not supposed to

Believe me, if he's something that I want, I'm steppin' closer
I'm not one for playing high-pole
Like the house of ditty-nine-oh-two-one-oh type of the ho
I treat a man like he treats me

The difference between a hooker and a ho ain't nothin' but a fee
So hold your tongue tightly, wish you could be like me
You're poppin' all that mess only to stress and to spite me
Now you can get with that or you can get with this
But I don't give a shit 'cause really it's none of your business

1993, S and P, packin' and mackin'
Bamboozlin' and smackin' suckers with this track
Throw the beat back in

If I want to take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business
And she want to be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It's none of your business

Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm givin' skins to
It's none of your business
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time
It's none of your business

How many rules am I to break before you understand
That your double-standards don't mean shit to me?
I know exactly what you say when I turn and walk away
But that's ok 'cause I don't let it get it to me

Now every move I make somebody's clockin'
Don't ask me nothin', will you just leave me alone?
Never mind who's the guy that I took home, to bone

Ok, Miss Thing never givin' up skins
If you don't like him or his friends what about that Benz?
Your Pep-Pep's got an ill rep
With all that macaroni trap for rap you better step
Or better yet get your head checked

'Cause I refuse to be played like a penny cent trick deck of cards
No, I ain't hard like the bitches on a boulivard
My face ain't scarred, and I don't dance in bars
You can call me a tramp if you want to
But I remember the punk who just humped and dumped you
Or you can front if you have to
But everybody gets horny just like you
So, yo, so, yo, ho - check it, double deck it on a record butt-naked
Pep's ass gets respect, and this butt is none of your business

If I want to take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business
And she want to be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It's none of your business

Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm givin' skins to
It's none of your business
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time
It's none of your business

So the moral of this story is, who are you to judge?
There's only one true judge, and that's God

So chill, and let my Father do His job

Forget that you're a lady, and give 'em what they deserve

Now I've got this real phat attitude because of all the hype
Jealous-ass rappers broke as hell trying to play me on the mic
So test my respect, mess around, yeah, bitch
Jump up and get beat down
Now Salt shorty, light-skinned, sexy, and your man know
I got him screamin' like a hooker in the front row
So you better check my record, better yet, bum
My name is super for a record, check my platinum album

It's not meant for you to do
You even sound wack when you try to check the mic
One, two, one, two
But wait I'm not through, how you livin' sayin' old rhymes
Tryin' to get new?
You don't work like the two to make hip-hop
So you can talk until your big, suckin' lips pop
The next time you try to play me, you might catch a fist to the
Nose, ho
So there you go

You hear talk about Pep around the way gettin' skeezed
Yo, me and my man was with Pepa last night, yo
Nigga please
You couldn't hump me if my first name was Cooty Cat
Your little Jimmy can't even hold your zipper back
Why don't you tell the story right, man?
The only skins you ever hit was the skins on your right hand
You rolled up on me in your man's Beemer
And I could look at you and tell you was a meat-beatin' daydreamer

You put the window down tryin' to act real slick
And started smilin' like a hooker with a bag of tricks
You stuck your hand out the window trying to show me gold
Your forty-second street Rolex was kinda old
I wrote a number, and I know you thought you'd get humped
But it was Dial-A-Date 1-900-Chump
So why you runnin' around town playin' Jeopardy?
Get off my bra-strap, boy, stop sweatin' me

Now somebody's gettin' on my nerves, and I'm wrecked to get crazy
It never fails to amaze me
How people never miss a possip, they just believe the gossip
Instead of finding out the truth of what's up
It's got my nostrils flairin'
I'd be a fool if I believe half of the dumb shit I be hearing
'Cuz ev'rytime I meet a guy that's got it goin' on
One of my jealous girlfriends gotta find something that's wrong

If he's not drivin' a Benz or Beemer then he's bummy
Or he's sellin' Buddah if he's got plenty of money
Now ask me why, I don't know why or well or what the hell
So breakin' up the code because of someone's getting jeal
I've got enough problems of my own
To sit up on the phone talkin' about on who he's gettin' bone

Somebody's ringin' my bell [Open the door!] [I'm comin'] 
Somebody's knockin' at my door [Let me in  please] [Damn!] 
Somebody's ringin' my bell [Come on  baby] 

It's your man driving to my house every day 
Trying to get a play but I say no way 
Keep him on a leash 'cause he's a D O G 

Hot diggity dog comin' for my coochie 
Boom bam-boom, knock-knock-knock 

Waking up my Moms, waking up my Pops, somebody call the cops 
And get this fool off my stoop, see 



Can you believe that your man is a groupie? 



Not-not dedicated, ought to get him spaded 



Cut the nuts and get his shots upgraded 



So what ya feed him at home? It must be bones 



Give him some meat so he can leave me alone 



He's a somma time man, so what ya gonna do? 



Like Eddie Murphy said, ""Yes, your man, too""

(repeat) 







Now here's a description of the (nigga) that I'm dissin' 



If your man fits this category then dismiss him 



You gotta dig him, get rid of him, have no pity for him 



Send him on his way, yeah, girl, and forget about him 



He's got a problem, and it's similar to drugs 



Not weed, cocaine, crack or dud, it's an erection, huh 



He's a mission, a sexual transition 



Addiction, affliction, so girls, sign the petition 



He's a man that likes easy pickin' 



Thinking that every girl is like easy stickin' 



You gotta realize that girls are not store-bought 



Like Newports, a pack of cigarettes smoked to the butt 



So now I know that what I know I know is now true 



You're being true to lovin' a brother that's not with you 



You want to bootie smack from the back 



But if you come like that you might catch a Diggum smack 







He's a somma time man 







[Yo, this is dedicated to all you somma time fools

Sometimes you will, sometimes you won't 



Now you see 'em, yo, now you don't

So don't you ain't throw it out there, baby] 







CHORUS 







He's a somma time man, a summer somma time 



Especially when it's hot sex is always on his mind 



Lookin', dippin' and dog your short skirts, no stockings 



No matter who it is, long as he's boot-knockin' 



??? 



??? 



La-di-da-di all the way to ? 



Runnin' through girls like it's musical punanee 



So come one, come all, he try to right you all 



With that greater than Tibet-time free-fall 



Talking that same old same lame ??? 



Diggity-yack cat brother talking that bullcrap 



But everytime he parts his lips 



It's funny because I always seems to smell his (shit)

But watched  clocked  then I kept bluffin' 
And schemed to capture the skill of your rapture 
Master become the massa and kick at ya

Now I'm slappin' you back with the same crap you gave me

And I'm sick and tired of your shit

Let's talk about sex for now
To the people at home or in the crowd
It keeps coming up anyhow
Don't decoy, avoid, or make void the topic
'Cause that ain't gonna stop it
Now we talk about sex on the radio and video shows
Many will know anything goes
Let's tell it how it is, and how it could be
How it was, and of course, how it should be
Those who think it's dirty have a choice
Pick up the needle, press pause, or turn the radio off
Will that stop us, Pep? I doubt it
All right then, come on, Spin

Hot to trot, make any man's eyes pop
She use what she got to get whatever she don't got
Fellas drool like fools, but then again they're only human
The chick was a hit because her body was boomin'
Gold, pearls, rubies, crazy diamonds
Nothin' she ever wore was ever common
Her dates heads of state, men of taste
Lawyers, doctors, no one was too great for her to get with
Or even mess with, the Prez she says was next on her list
And believe me, you, it's as good as true
There ain't a man alive that she couldn't get next to
She had it all in the bag
So she should have been glad
But she was mad and sad and feelin' bad
Thinkin' about the things that she never had
No love, just sex, followed next with a check and a note
That last night was dope, dope

Take it easy now

Let's talk about sex, baby (sing it)

Spend quality time with my baby on the norm 
But when it's time to get the nook, yo, I go on strong 
Black, intelligent, wise beyond my years 
No time for frontin', no time for fears

Pick up to the women out there on your own 
Livin' swell, see, and doin' it, and doin' it well 
Hey, hell, no one can stop me, I got the knack 
Making funny matter phat just by making phat tracks 
Who's world is this? You know the world is mine

Two times for your mind, one more for your body

Responsibilties and I still do how I feel 
But it ain't just me anymore 
Me and my baby give our heart and my soul like it's sporadic 
Convulsions of laughter, spittin' out rapture

Hard work payin' off, baby paw 
You know who we are going far on this here coup-de-grace 
Ini-mini-miny behind me the loser 
Could hold for a sec but got wrecked by the bruiser 
Didn't know who's the real tag-team here 
The one-two-three dance, now it's all clear 
Did we taunt, pomp, stomp, romp 
Open up a pre-school to babysit the competition 
Yes, and the mission I'm dissin' 
To write the premonition so no switchin' position 
I make the bacon so crispy, no need to get pissed or mad 
I does it all, kid, I'm bad

Salt-N-Pepa,"It was December 24 on hollis after the dark
My man santa saw a rabbi and gave the strangest remark
He said that giving was his living and I had to take part
So I grabbed a bag of goodies and I hopped up on his cart
I laced the pockets of the poor and gave the hoodie a play
Dropped some dollars up on hollis and I went on my way
I hear your jingle Mr. Kringle peep the single, my man
So Santa hit a brotha off and come as quick as you can!

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Now all mase know
When it's eight twenty-four
He be looking at the door for the ho ho ho
'Cause I know
When there's a Christmas uptown
Ain't no chimney for santa to come down

Now to me, pd I had a lot
Appreciated everything that I got
Though I used to take my pops
Who ain't caught me shaking the box
'Cause I knew I couldn't wait till it turned 12 o'clock

Cookies and milk
Satin and silk
I'm chillin in the living room, wrapped in a quilt
I'm waiting on this fat red suit wearing-comparing
My gifts to my homeboy next door to me
A gift here, none there, but who cares
My little sister needs a comb just to braid her nappy hair
But here we go again waiting on the enemy
To slide down the chimney
Look here, that ain't reality

Just slip a benzo under the tree for me

I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, are you really real?
Chris kringle
Let me see you make my pockets jingle (ching ching)
We need some jobs in the ghetto
Too much gangbanging where kids are playin
I hear the church bells ringing
On Christmas eve
I believe
Jesus-calling me
Forget the gifts and the shopping lists
And the new kicks
Your just falling for tricks
(You better praise him)

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

It's the gritty-the grimy
The low down, the shifty
Yo sticky, christmas time in the city
Late night, stars are bright
We gettin rocked!
With the 50 St. Nicholas
Start rippin' this

It's the Grinch who stole Christmas
Climbin' down ya chimney
Kids open up they gifts
They all gonna be empty
Just like mine was
I hate to say it
But if I wasn't a boy I wouldn't have had nuthin to play wit!

On December 25th I knew I wasn't getting jack
When I saw Santa Claus on the corner buying crack
I ran up on him with the Cadillac and asked him ""yo what's up with that? ""
He said ""There ain't no Christmas kid"" and I can't get him back
Back in the days, Christmas was deep
My moms put presents under the tree while I played sleep
And peeped ha! Santa Claus never gave me nuthin
Seen them mad faces, lying and frontin
So do some good to the ghetto, Mr. Chris Kringle
Come and stay awhile, kick it with god's angel
Take and acknowledge my wisdom and understand
That santa claus is a black man

Rough roads, I travel many
Paid dues so I choose, I call you out, you owe me
Made a way for you, don't play like you don't know me
Can't end till I say when, now come again
With the yes, yes, and then
Check it, check it out, ladies say, ow
To the beat yo, fellas gotta, ho
You gotta earn my respect, break a sweat baby, work it
Eliminate the job, turkey, or you can jerk it
Take it to your face with taste and play on
Billboard chart (Rap part), stay on
Arrive with the mic, it's live and Memorex
Promote safe sex, the best, one love, respect

A good life, a new life

Crispy currency is my smell
And the body's packed well
Can't you tell, Spinderella got new clientele
Well I'm livin' swell, or should I say swollen
I eats gourmet, and it slides easy through my throat
And when I'm rollin', cruisin' in whatever car that I be usin'
Passin', knowin' who's
Always winnin' and never losin' now (Who rocks the best)
Yo, it doesn't matter, 'cause I live a little phatter
No concern about the chit-chatter
Once I heard the pitter-patter, I had to blow so

Get on now, Cher! Do I have to? Yeah! 

Well I really don't have too much to say 
Yo, then here's my story anyway 
It's just a little somethin' too hot to be missed, girl 
I was going downtown ? serious 
Cher took the train home from work 
Pissed off because of a stain on my shirt 
The train made a stop (Where?) Two hundred and five 
And a little soft guy walked inside 

He wore plastic Bally's and a booty Gucci suit 
Cracked a little smile and showed a fake gold tooth 
Was he cute? Negative, he was a dupe 
Instead of Polo he wore ?

La-di-da-di What? 
La-di-da-di Uh-huh, word to mother 

The boy was rude, I didn't approve 
He tried to make a move I said, ""Stop it, dude!"" 
I started to cuss and began to swear 
He said, ""Listen girl, I like the way you comb your hair 
And I like the stylish clothes you wear 
Is there something that I can do 
To show how much I really care? 
Like when I'm all alone with you 
My heart just skips a beat or two 
And you put that fire inside of me 
That shows it's more than just a dream 
And I like it, and I like it"" 
I said, ""Please, don't get excited!"" 

Don't you know I'm too young for you, mister? 
Sally from the Valley - she's my sister 
And that lady you dissed - that was my mother 
You hurt two of my family, you won't get another 
He tried to deny it, said it was a lie 
He wanted to explain, explain to me why 
I said, ""Don't bother, there's really no need 
Sally died when she hit the concrete"" 
He said, ""Come on, you're puttin' me on"" 
As I got up to walk he sang this song: 

""Oh, baby please don't go 
What must I do to show 
The way I feel for you, girl 
Is going to be real?

Und Ungeziefer

Alles muss wachsen, wie die Marge des Gewinns.

Gnadenlos wächst alles weiter,
Steckt die ganze Welt in Brand!
Lasst uns über Leichen gehen,
Aug' um Aug' und Hand um Hand!

Gnadenlos wächst diese Plage
Bis ans Ende dieses Wegs.
Auch in dir wächst das Geschwür,
Denn wildes Wachstum heißt auch Krebs.

Nowhere to go

There's a plan, there's no one here by circumstance
And I believe that no one here is here by chance

No need to complicate or talk philosophy
Love one another is what we need
Ain't that the way that Jesus said that it should be

Just out there sippin' tea and talkin' for a while
Sit down for supper and speak our minds
And reminisce how fast the good times they go by
As sweet as a goodnight kiss, can we go back to this?

And why should the shadows come?
Why should my heart be lonely
And long for Heaven and home?

When Jesus is my captain
My constant friend is He
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me

I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
Oh, His eye is on the sparrow

Salvator Tassone,"Without a song the day would never end
Without a song the road would never bend
When things go wrong, a man ain't got a friend
Without a song

That field of corn would never see a plow
That field of corn would be deserted now
A man is born but he's no good no-how
Without a song

I got my troubles and woe but sure as I know that Jordan will roll
I'll get along as long as a song is strong in my soul

I'll never know what makes the grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all

Dort hin wo alles ist, wie damals, nur das Datum ist anders

Wo Regeln eingehalten werden und was nicht voll ?
Wo kids zur Schule geh'n
Rebellen nicht rebellieren
Frag' wo die schönsten Frauen sind
Die schönsten Frauen, sind hier

Wo alles anfing, Kinderzimmer im Elternhaus

Ob es mir gut geht, ob die Musik noch genug Geld einbringt
Wann das hab' und kommt, wenn man mich wieder im Fernseh'n sieht

Rede nicht viel, mach' mir kein' Kopf über so manche Dinge

We goin' die thuggin', cause that's just the life we lead
We goin' die thuggin', busting at our enemies

Busting at our foes, for the sake of being riders
Till the casket close, thug shit be inside us
We try to survive it, cause all we got is the projects
On the camouflage sets, in the bricks, niggas die wet
Till the death for street glory, it's infinite beef
Though it's most of the reasons lot of niggas six deep
With heat, when we ride, we 'posed to roll that way
To keep a soul that way, with 44's that spray
The key to the city, it come in bricks or them birds
Thug niggas, drug dealers making flipping that 3rd
Born to my work, deserve what's supposed to be mine
If it's what the fuck we need 
Then D, we 'posed to be ride
Try to separate us, but it's survival of a thug
While you try to play us, now you gotta watch my slugs
Ride wit us, die wit us, follow us to the war

I've been committed too long for me not to succeed

Keeping the guns cocked
Surrounding the block, opening up shop
With a bundle of rocks in my socks

Stank a lick for the fetti
Get the cash and clown with it
Hennessy and weed when I'm comin'
Throw your guns up, let me see
If you bitch ass niggas gon make some noise bruh
Follow me now cause I'm coming up
And ain't that cold I got too many bitches running up
And niggas wanted to blast me, police harass me

Like I'm faking the game
But taking the pain letting them niggas know
How I'm shaking the game with nothing to explain

With enough ammo for every nigga that's with ya

Do you need anybody?
I just need somebody to love
And could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

Eu já posso ver, enfim
Não há nada
Que resta aqui pra mim

Não vou parar
Nada vai impedir
No caminho vou prosseguir
A vida é
Um jogo e
Suas regras não servem pra mim

Você me pede pra não ir
Vou seguir, vou seguir
Os dados eu já lancei
Agora espera a sua vez

Combati
Lutei, cai
Me levantei
E agora eu sei
O que a vida reservou
Para mim
E, e, e, e, e eu não vou parar!
E eu não vou, não vou, não vou parar!

Olha pra mim
Na minha vida já lutei
Agora vivo
Tudo aquilo que eu sonhei

Sam Bacco,"Oh  the snowflakes fell in silence 
Over Belleau Wood that night 
For a Christmas truce had been declared 
By both sides of the fight 
As we lay there in our trenches 
The silence broke in two 
By a German soldier singing 
A song that we all knew 
Though I did not know the language 
The song was ""Silent Night"" 
Then I heard my buddy whisper  
""All is calm and all is bright"" 
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me 
'Cause I'd die if I was wrong 
But I stood up on my trench 
And I began to sing along 
Then across the frozen battlefield 
Another's voice joined in 
Until one by one each man became 
A singer of the hymn 
Then I thought that I was dreaming 
For right there in my sight 
Stood the German soldier 
'Neath the falling flakes of white 
And he raised his hand and smiled at me 
As if he seemed to say 
Here's hoping we both live 
To see us find a better way 
Then the devil's clock struck midnight 
And the skies lit up again 
And the battlefield where heaven stood 
Was blown to hell again 
But for just one fleeting moment 
The answer seemed so clear 
Heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's just beyond the fear 
No, heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's for us to find it here",Belleau Wood,1997

And they scattered seeds on the ground
And one is lost and one is found
Water is moving underground

When I was a young girl
I would sleep in a tall tree
On the down of bending boughs
And from the mount of his shoulders
I would traverse the valleys
Through his dusk and dawning eyes

""I will let you in,"" says the doe to my arrow
""and you will wear my bones and my skin""

Love is ruthless

And in the nest from the forest
I would carry an ember
And with a burning heart we'd walk
And when he asks me to rest with him
I would lay down my fire
And in that heart we'd sing and talk

I am a racoon
And you are an owl
I will run from you in the middle of the night
And we will stike a truce in the the billowing tower
And we'll eclipse the moon with a fire light

Love is ruthless

You love me in my dreams
It's easier when I'm fast asleep
But I don't want you to come to me anymore
The river bed has married me
So I don't want you to come to me anymore

And out of ashes comes morning
And the ritual of bathing
In the pools at bridal falls
And from the mouth of my lover
I will drink of the river
And kiss his jade and marble walls

You have spilled the red from my heart with your arrow
And you will make my bed under the red grass
And I will give my flesh and my blood and my marrow
And you will wear my bones and my skin
Hunting my dress
Love is ruthless

And the tall trees all fell down
And they scattered seeds on the ground

You hold in your hand

Is living again

It's time to go back to school
It's just a little sad
The way you play the fool

You're just as bad

Blackberry blossom when the summertime came?
The blackberry blossom, oh the last time I saw one
Was down in the bramble where I rambled in the spring
The bramble was wild I was torn by the briars
My love he wooed me as I lie there
With a flower in my hair and my cheeks all flashy 
Was the blackberry blossom from the blackberry bush 

When I picked the berry I didn't miss the blossom 
The blackberry blossom was white as the snow 
But the berry that it brings is sweeter than molasses 
And black as the wings of the Arkansas crow 
The Arkansas crow is a devil and a demon 
Known for his cackling and his screaming 
Driving away the swallow and the thrush 
From the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush  

I was picking berries when that crow flew above me 
Carrying my lover so far away 
Now each spring I lay a blackberry blossom 
By a cold gravestone on the Arkansas clay 
The Arkansas clay is rocky and hard 
With weeds growing over in the old graveyard 
And the day settles down to an evening hush  
Over the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush",Blackberry Blossom,1996

I'm in between freights, and I sure would be obliged
If I could share your company.
I'm on my way to nowhere; I been runnin' from my past,
Runnin' from the things I used to be.


Now I know my words sound strange to you
But if you'll wait till my song is sung and my story's told
You might come to understand
Why I'm old and bent and devil spent, and a-runnin' out of time
When not long ago I held a royal flush in my hand.

Chorus:
Oh, I was a supermarket fool; I was a motorbank stool pigeon,
Robbin' my own time.
I thought I'd lost my blues, yes, I thought I'd paid my dues
And I thought I'd found a life to suit my style.
And I was Spider John, the robberman
Long, tall, and handsome,
Yes, I was Spider John with a loaded hand
Takin' ransom.

And then one day I met Diamond Lil
And she was as sweet a thing, I declare, as the summer wind
Had ever blown my way.
Lil she had no idea of my illustrious occupation, 
She thought I was a saint and not a sinner gone astray

Spider he loved his Lily so much
He could not confess his sins, for he knew if he did
The lady would surely take her leave.
But you know that the word got around, and Lily left town
And he never saw her again,
Tossin' and turnin' and causin' his heart to grieve.

Chorus

And that is all my story.
It's been these thirty years since I took the road
To find my precious jewel one.
Now if you see my Lily, won't you give her my regards,
Tell her old Spider got tangled in the black web that he spun
You can tell her that Spider got tangled in the black web that he spun.

And fill the spinning sky

Sometimes I don't hear
Sometimes the shape I'm in

This old ramblin' all around
And marry you a sweet loving wife""

From a girl i used to know
I guess i read it front to back
Fifty times or so
It's all about the good life
And stayin' at ease with the world
It's funny how i love that book
And i never loved that girl

Up to the light comin' through the door
It's a prism glass i found on the road
Can you see that little rainbow
Well it's not really a prism i guess
It just broke in a funny way
I found it on my way from texas
Headed for l.a.

This guitar was given me
By old man thomas gray
It's not too much to look at
But i pick it every day
It's been across the country
Four or five times i guess
Between me and old man tom
It never got much rest

Well that's about all i own
And all i care to i guess
Except this pair of boots
And that funny yellow vest
And that leather jacket and leather bag
And hat hangin' on the wall

We forded the nueces
We swum the guadalupe

There's many a river

Now the fair angelina
Runs glossy and gliding
The crooked colorado
Runs weaving and winding
The slow san antonio
Courses and plains
But I never will walk
By the brazos again

She kissed me and she hugged me
And she called me her dandy
The trinity's muddy
But the brazos quick sandy
She kissed me and she hugged me
And she called me her own
But down by the brazos
She left me alone

They're plump and they're pretty
The sabine and the sulphur
Hold beauties a'many

There are girls by the score
But down by the brazos
I'll wander no more

One that they could croon 
As only they can.

And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn

Use the whole darn bunch
Drown it with fudge

Give her two spoons

When he began to rip, he really played it from the hip
And when I asked about his name, they told me, that's The Lip

No one plays high notes like The Lip

He's got a tone that's reminiscent of a boy named Bix
He plays so high that only dogs can hear him, just for kicks

He says, I'll tell you, hon'
I read a little bit but not enough to hurt me none

(Noo, Lip er ace)

I never heard a trumpet player play a note so high
I had to coax a lot before The Lip would tell me why
Then he took out a little jar that's labelled high note grease
And he rubs a little every night on his mouthpiece
(Yip yip yip yip)
No one plays high notes like The Lip

Listen here gal, are you kiddin' about all that high note grease?

No, some cat's told me he makes it himself

Just hang my cradle, Mammy mine
Right on that Mason Dixon Line
And swing it from Virginia
To Tennessee with all the love that's in ya
""Weep No More My Lady,"" sing that song again for me
And ""Old Black Joe"" just as though you had me on your knee
A million baby kisses I'll deliver
The minute that you sing ""The Swanee River""

Sam Butera,"Three coins in the fountain,
Each one seeking happiness.
Thrown by three hopeful lovers,
Which one will the fountain bless?

Three hearts in the fountain,
Each heart longing for its home.
There they lie in the fountain
Somewhere in the heart of Rome.

Which one will the fountain bless?
Which one will the fountain bless?

Three coins in the fountain,
Through the ripples how they shine.
Just one wish will be granted,
One heart will wear a valentine.

Make it mine!
Make it mine!
Make it mine!

Three coins in the fountain,
Through the ripples how they shine.
And just one wish will be granted,
One heart will wear a valentine.

Yeah, this is the Big Bopper speakin'
Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, you sweet thing!
Do I what? Will I what?
Oh baby, you know what I like! 

Chantilly Lace had a pretty face and a ponytail hangin' down
A wiggle in her walk and a giggle in her talk
Make the world go 'round
Ain't nothing in the world like a big eyed girl
To make me act so funny, make me spend my money
Make me feel real loose like a long necked goose
Like a, oh baby, that's a-what I like! 

What's that, baby?
But, but, but, oh, honey!
Oh baby, you know what I like!

Sam Butera,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You,1994
Sam Butera,"""I'm the Sheik of Araby, 
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you're asleep 
Into your tent I'll creep.
The stars that shine above,
Will light our way to love.
You'll rule this land with me;",The Sheik of Araby,1994
Sam Butera,"I've tried to break the habit
But somehow I just keep waking up alone
There's something deep inside me
That refuses to believe you're really gone
And every night I fall asleep
By your side of this great big double bed
Remembering that the worst you ever gave me
Was the best I ever had
I know I should be sleeping
Like a kitten in somebody else's arms
But I lie awake remembering all the ways
We used to keep each other warm
I know that nothing's perfect but we came so close
How could it turned out bad?
But even so the worst you ever gave me
Was the best I ever had
How I missed your tender kisses
And the gentle arms that used to hold me tight
Oh they say that all good things must end
But endings always leave somebody sad
But I remember that the worst you ever gave me
Was the best I ever had
I can't forget the worst you ever gave me
Was the best I ever had",The Best I Ever Had,1995
Sam Butera,"Sunlight dances on the sea
Tender thoughts occur to me
I have often seen your eyes
In the nighttime when I dream

When I pass a garden fair
And the scent is in the air
In my mind a dream awakes
And my heart begins to break

But you said goodbye to me
Now all I can do is grieve
Can it be that you forgot?
Darling forget me not!

Please don't say farewell
And leave this heart that's broken
Come back to Surriento
So I can mend",Come Back to Sorrento,1996
Sam Butera,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,1996
