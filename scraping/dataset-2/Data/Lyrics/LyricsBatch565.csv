Kurt Wagner,"Here comes the cool air, the light chill of the fall
Blowing from either direction
Blowing across the yard it's crisp and it's cool
Dogs like it, as they sit around in the sun
And stubbornly I remain under a tree

We're supposed to grow cold as the day wears on
I'm'a looking for the future, today, today, today, today

And at the same time I am dreading the outcome of our actions
Fall makes me feel a little sad sometimes
Whip out the sweater and the second layer and it's time for a change
And surely it's the way,
Oh boy, oh shit!

Kurt Wagner,"Before the bitching and the bore
The end of the cold war
The principles they were apparent

The bucket beside the door
The shoulder carries more
Than the sum of all our parts together

It's extraneous, aware
Did you say to us, I don't care

There's dust on my particulars
Of that you can be certain
It's times like these when I'm alone
I miss the iron curtain
Oh 65
Oh 65

Now the trouble with hanging out
Is the frequency of doubt
As it enters in the new equation

In the circus of the stars
There's the likelihood that ours
Is just a cheaper form of neurosis

It's extraneous, aware
Did you say to us, I don't care

There's dust on my particulars
Of that you can be certain
It's times like these when I'm alone
I miss the iron curtain

The uselessness of smoking pot

You haven't got to say

Kurt Wagner,"Covering you, cradle your head
Hellacious view, salacious red
Simple problems send the pain
You take your bicycle out of the rain

People you, both hated
The problem, you're jaded
I hear you don't any way

For I call, my heart attack
Shed me a tear, make me a mess
I would not call you up this late
If I'da known you'd be this way

Proud shapes, before you
Call maybe, I'll know you
Everyone, the will all the same

I couldn't wait
I couldn't wait
I couldn't wait

I fiddled, you faked it
More riddled, than rated
How many fingers do i have up

Thought maybe you would like to wait
Out in the lobby, while they debate
The uncertain future, it's close at hand
Laid out like doughnuts, the promised land

We lost and we hated

I couldn't wait",I Couldn't Wait,1999
Kurt Wagner,"Blood absorbed into the bread of man
Grows heavy on the plate
If bread were eaten with every meal
It wouldn't taste so great
In every kitchen in every house
On good days or in bad
Content or bitchin' you turn to the light
That falls on the things you had

And it's always something
Else you had in mind
And you always notice
When something isn't right
Let the fork fall from your right hand
Your hand
Your hand

Behold the rock and roll its mossy ass
Over on its side
Look to see the grubs and little silverfish
Scurry from the light
A child is playing with the volume knob
And the radio goes dead
A father speaks and then an ambulance
Is heard outside your head

And it's always something
Else you had in mind
And you always notice
When something isn't right
Let the stone fall back again
Again
Again",Somehow You Could Always Tell,1999
Kurt Wagner,"Do a little dance around the table
Tell a little tale about despair
Keep in mind you never had a weakness
Or at least one you never had to share

This is not a story or a fable
Not even substance for a stare
A desperate cry for hope and reason
These feelings catch you unaware

When they've collected all your tragic endings
And they feel the every move you make
You look behind to see the traces
Of your latest mistake

Between the late and early morning
You pull the cover from the chair
And you take the pieces from the package
And you place them somewhere over there

When they've collected all your tragic endings
And they feel the every move you make
You look behind to see the traces
Of your latest mistake

Am I your living proof of purchase
With sorry notes we do compare
The prickly pear the shitty season
The overwhelming sense of fair play

When they've collected all your tragic endings
And they feel the every move you make
You look behind to see the traces
Of your latest mistake",Table Dance,1999
Kurt Wagner,"Once a label is on something
It becomes an it
Like it's no longer alive

It's like a loss of vision
Or some dark impression
Or a black spot on your eye

If it's up to you
My little sweet baboo
Through the shouting and the fever
Think of life as queer
Think of it my dear
And some knobs or a fancy tone
From here there is no reason
Baby's got it made
But it's not what the life's about

What is imagination
May become a fact
If we think of it that way
If you want to know

I can tell you now
Oh if you make it through somehow
Or is it best to keep or fall to sleep
it isn't looking very good to me

You beat him so hard that he was bent and lame,
And I know who everybody's going to blame.
I don't believe he knows I acted for our good.
I'd save him all this suffering if I could.
Don't believe...our good...
And I'd save him if I could...

Cut the confessions, forget the excuses.
I don't understand why you're filled with remorse.
All that you've said has come true with a vengeance.
The mob turned against him, you backed the right horse.

What you have done will be the saving of everyone.
You'll be remembered forever for this.
And not only that, you've been paid for your efforts.
Pretty good wages for one little kiss.

JUDAS

Christ, I know you can't hear me,
But I only did what you wanted me too.
Christ, I'd sell out the nation,
For I have been saddled with the murder of you.
I have been spattered with innocent blood.
I shall be dragged through the slime and the mud.
I have been spattered with innocent blood.
I shall be dragged through the slime and the mud!
I don't know how to love him.
I don't know why he moves me.
He's a man. He's just a man.
He is not a king. He is just the same
As anyone I know.
He scares me so!
When he's cold and dead will he let me be?
Does he love me too? Does he care for me?
My mind is in darkness.
God, God I'm sick. I've been used,
And you knew all the time.
God, God I'll never ever know why you chose me for your crime.
You're so bloody, Christ.

You have murdered me.",Judas' Death,1998
Kurt Yaghjian,"We've been sitting on the fence for far too long

Why let him upset us?
Caiaphas, let him be
All those imbeciles will see
He really doesn't matter

Jesus is important
We've let him go his way before
And while he starts a major war
We theorize and chatter

He's just another scripture
Thumping hack from Galilee

The difference is they call him King
The difference frightens me
What about the Romans?
When they see King Jesus crowned
Do you think they'll stand around
Cheering and applauding?

What about our people?
If they see we've lost our nerve
Don't you think that they deserve
Something more rewarding?

They've got what they want
They think so, anyway
If he's what they want
Why take their toy away?
He's a craze

Put yourself in my place
I can hardly step aside
Can not let my hands be tied
I am law and order

What about our priesthood?
Don't you see that we could fall?
If we are to last at all
We can not be divided

Then say so to the council
But don't rely on subtlety
Frighten them or they won't see

Then we are decided
Then we are decided

",Then We Are Decided,1998
Kurt Yaghjian,"Good Caiaphas the council waits for you
The Pharisees and Priests are here for you
Ah gentlemen, you know why we are here
We've not much time and quite a problem here
(Outside)

Hosanna, Superstar
Listen to that howling mob of blockheads in the street
A trick or two with lepers and the whole town's on its feet
He is dangerous
(Outside)

Jesus Christ Superstar, tell us that you're who they say you are
He is dangerous, that man is in town right now
To whip up some support, a rabble rousing mission
That I think we must abort, he is dangerous
(Outside)

Jesus Christ Superstar
He is dangerous
Look Caiaphas, they 're right outside our yard
Quick Caiaphas, go call the Roman guard

No wait, we need a more permanent solution to our problem
What then to do about Jesus of Nazareth
Miracle wonder man, hero of fools?
No riots, no army, no fighting, no slogans

One thing I'll say for Him, Jesus is cool
We dare not leave Him to His own devices
His half-witted fans will get out of control
How can we stop Him?

His glamor increases by leaps every minute
He's top of the poll, I see bad things arising
The crowd  crown Him king which the Romans would ban
I see blood and destruction, our  elimination because of one man

Blood and destruction because of one man
Because, because, because of one man
Our elimination because of one man
Because, because, because of one, 'cause of one, 'cause of one man

What then to do about this Jesus mania?
How do we deal with the carpenter king?
Where do we start with a man who is bigger
Than John was when John did his Baptism thing?

Fools, you have no perception
The stakes we are gambling are frighteningly high
We must crush Him completely
So like John before Him, this Jesus must die

For the sake of the nation this Jesus must die
Must die, must die, this Jesus must die
So like John before Him, this Jesus must die
Must die, must die, this Jesus must
Jesus must, Jesus must die

To show the world just what you've got
Just grab a partner,hit the floor
'Cause this is what you're waiting for
It's time for us to take a chance
So get on up,got out and dance
Just shout it out and spread the news
About those low-down Boogie blues

Now The Boogie Blues is nothin' new
It started back in '22
Some guys and girls were sittin' 'round
In a little club outside of town
In walked a dude from parts unknown
Without a friend,he was all alone
Dressed up in tails and button shoes
He taught them all The Boogie Blues

I've got a dance you ought to know
It's no too fast and not too slow
It's not to hard and not too easy
Not too straight and not too sleazy
Something different,something new
Something special just for you
Something just to rock your shoes
Something called The Boogie Blues

The Boogie Blues has got the beat
The Boogie Blues will move your feet
Feel the beat and spread the new
About those low-down Boogie Blues
The dude got up to whirl and dance
Just like a dervish in a trance
Spinning,twirling,up and down
Round and round and round and round
Just like Bojangles or Astaire
A dapper dude without a care
With flying feet,top hat and cane
You knew he only drank champagne

Just watching him would keep you busy
Make you feel a little dizzy
Such a sight for all to see
The Boogie Blues done to a ""T""
Leaping high and doing splits
The crowd was simply having fits
They cheered until their throats were dry
But soon he had to say goodbye

I've had a ball the stranger said
But I should quit while I'm ahead
Those splits and leaps are hard to do
They really take it out of you
But in a minute when I am gone
The night is young,it's far from dawn
You've seen the dance,you've heard the news
It's time to do The Boogie Blues

The Boogie Blues has got the beat
The Boogie Blues will move your feet
Feel the beat and spread the news
About those low-down Boogie Blues",Boogie Blues,1982
Kurtis Blow,"Looking back through time in the corners of my mind 
I see you standing here 
Oh baby how I miss you 
And how much I need to kiss you 
Run my fingers through your hair 
But then again it's just my imagination 
Being close to you was such a sweet sensation 
But then we had to have that terrible confrontation 

Daydreamin' takes me where I want to be 
Daydreamin' lets me have you here with me 

Oh girl if you knew all that I've been going through 
You'd have a change of heart 
But come rain or shine you're foverer on my mind 
Of my life you're the part 
But then again,it's just my imagination 
Being close to you was such a sweet sensation 
But then we had to have that terrible confrontation

Kurtis Blow,"I was walkin' down the avenue the other day
When I heard this crazy sound
It was nothing but a  guy with a set of drums
But he was really gettin' down
He said my name is Jack and I'm a rhythm attack
When I got a pair of sticks in hand
I got savior-faire on the bass and snare
And I'm here to take my stand
I got juice

The next to show was a guy named Joe
Came in from Kalamazoo
Had a Kango cap with a real smooth rap
And he knew just what to do
He was an outta work bricklayer,part-time conga player
Brought along a set of LP's
Don't do a lot of talkin',let my fingers do the walkin'
And I play just as pretty as you please
I got juice

There was a guy with a bass,had a handsome face
And designer clothes all around
He said I'm into threads,don't wear Pro Keds
But I can make that funky sound
I play Fender Jazz,I got razz-ma-tazz
I got style from head to toe
It's a funky sound that I learned uptown
And I'm here to let you know
I got juice

About a minute went by when another guy
Showed up with an old guitar
Well it hard to be from World War III
Or run over by a car
It don't look like much,but it's sweet to touch
They don't make'em like this today
It's been around,but check the sound
Then see what you say
I got juice

There was a dude with a bongo,came from the Congo
Had a rough beat of his own
He dressed real strangle,wore beads and chains
But he could rock you all alone
He said call me Chief and I've got relief
For those weary dancin' blues
I got jungle heat from a primitive beat
And I know I'll move your shoes,HUH-HUH
I got juice

The next to show was Kurtis Blow
With timbales in his hands
Well I'm known for rap and I play with snap
And I think you'll understand
Now I was taught to play in a different way
By a dude known as Delgado
He said listen to me and you soon will be
A timbale desparato
I got juice

What do you say when you're bustin' loose
JUICE,JUICE
It's good for the gander and chilly for the goose

Kurtis Blow,"Intro:
I don't want a lot,I want just enough
So why has it got to be so damn TOUGH


Livin' on the uptown side of jive
Hustlin' a buck to stay alive
Lookin' for a ten and they give your five
Well it's tough
You talk to the boss,the boss is gruff
You ask for a raise and they call your bluff
You may get some,but it's never enough
Because it's tough

STRONG:Like a magnum force
ROUGH:Like a new divorce
MEAN:Like a three-time loser
BAD:Like an L.A. cruiser
DOWN:Like a limousine
BLIND:Like a submarine
HARD:Like cold concrete
TOUGH:That's the rhythm of the beat

You hit the street and you look for work
You don't want to be some welfare jerk
But I wonder how you get to be Captain Kirk
It's tough
Now Kirk has a ship called the Enterprise
He cuts the aliens down to size
But I wonder what he'd do with the uptown guys
They're tough

TOUGH:
Try to get some cash
When you're looking for a raise and they give you trash

ROUGH:
When you got it like that
And your woman's running 'round with a baseball bat

HARD:
Try to play it cool when the girl's all know you're an out of work fool

TOUGH:
How it seems to be,wish I had somebody lookin' out for me

Try to find a lover if you dare
Even if you do she just won't care
Well no one ever said that that life is fair
Because it's tough
Saw a fine young lady the other day
I started my rap,I had a lot to say
But she said she was goin' with a C.P.A.
Now it's tough

STRONG:Like a superhero
ROUGH:Like a bank book zero
MEAN:Like the Oakland Raiders
BAD:Like the Caped Crusaders
DOWN:Like a homerun ball
BLIND:Like an umpire's call
HARD:Like a cruel deceit
TOUGH:That's the rhythm of the beat

You worked all year to buy a brand new car
A Coupe de Ville or a Jaguar
But you didn't make enough for a good cigar
Because it's tough
So you went to the bank to try to get a loan
But the guy behind the desk had a heart os stone
He said ""You don't need a car,use the telephone!""
It's tough

TOUGH:
It's a way of life,lost your job
Your money,but not your wife

ROUGH:
Gettin' in the black,Uncle Sam's in your pocket 
And your woman's on your back

HARD:
That's the deal,had to get a loan just to buy a meal

TOUGH:
That's how it goes,when it's gettin' better,nobody knows

STRONG:Like Chocolate Thunder
ROUGH:Like Stevie Wonder
MEAN:Like Brucie The Shark
BAD:Like the Raider's Ark
DOWN:Like Sugar's Glove
BLIND:Like a man in love
HARD:Like a big defeat
TOUGH:That's the rhythm of the beat

TOUGH:That's the word,unemployment is all I heard
ROUGH:When you start your day,watch the finance man tow your car away
HARD:To hold a job when you've been replaced by a little blue knob

There are 8 million stories in the naked city 

Some ice cold and told without pity 

About the mean streets and the guetto culture 

The pimps the pushers the sharks and vultures 

Things that happen when it reaches dark 

And all the things you hear about Central Park 

You got to be down,you got to have strength 

If you're gonna survive past 110th 

Well it ain't no thing when blood is spilled 

The emergency ward is capacity filled 

And nothin' ever comes as a big surprise 

And the naked city never closes its eyes 

A new story every day 

Told a thousand different ways 

That's how it is and that's how it goes

Their attitudes were all la-de-da-de 

But little did they know there's a baby in the body 

She tried to hide it,but they'll soon know 

Because sooner or later that baby's got to show 

Can her daddy just accept it as a fact 

That it wasn't the meals and it wasn't the snack 

Then there's another girl,her name is Vicki 

The girl is fine,but sho'nuff tricky 

Vicki's fine,,but then she's not very kind 

She'll lay you down and then she'll rob you blind 

You wake up in the morning and you're feelin' blue 

Because Vicki is gone and your money is too

Fresh kid and the stories complete 

Born on a dim lit ghetto street 

Father unknown,mother astray 

He learned about life the real hard way 

Wearin' pretty things for all the ladies to see 

Funky fresh diamonds and gold jewelry 

Spent all his time just counting his bank 

Because he's a fly muh-ha-ha,now fill in the blank 

Because he's a fresh kid and his money's long 

Been the subject of a ghetto song 

Poor kids admire,ladies desire 

They say water can't put out this fire 

Because he's a fresh kid,yeah he's alright 

Grew up with the pushers and the pimps of the night 

And you could measure or even treasure 

The thought that cocaine became his pleasure 

Puruvian rock never cut with speed 

And he gets skied until his nose would bleed 

And that was just one weakness,must admit 

That when he took a hit he could never quit 

Because he's one slick pusher livin' day by day 

When the crazy thing happened along the way 

You know he started to base at a hell a pace 

And now it's a disgrace,he's got the pipe in his face 

For twenty-four seven a terrible Jones 

Didn't take care of business,didn't answer the phone 

He stayed home alone all in the twilight zone 

Just bittin' on a pipe like a dog on a bone 

Turnin' blue in the face,by holdin' his breath 

With the white cloud bullshit stuck in his chest 

But then he tried to stop,but it never worked 

And then the ladies started calling him a freebase jerk 

Just to break it all down,you know he's not very slick 

Because he spent all his money and he spent it real quick 

He lost his car,his house,his friends and his wife 

And basing cocaine made him lose his wife 

Because he bought some on credit and couldn't pay 

And then the pusher looked for him and blew him away

I'm not runnin', for Congress or the President
I'm just here, to tell the world, how my story went

And then I moved to London, bought a brand new home
And everywhere I went, I drew lots of attention
Like a stretch limousine, one of those new inventions
It took a few years 'fore the day had come
But I was ruler of the WORLD ranked number one
So I headed towards Washington to claim the crown
Let the whole world know that, the King was in town
As I, arrived, the crowd started to cheer

I just had to thank you all, huh, and me so
My first day in office, the King on the throne
I spent my first three hours on the telephone
You know with newsmen reporters, and votes too
I had so many calls, I didn't know what to do
You know out that office I continued to work
I signed so many papers, my fingers started to hurt
Then I shook off the pain, say this ain't no thing
'Cause there's nothin' in the world like bein' number one king!

If I ruled the world
Huh huh huh huh, huh-huh huh-huh
I'd love all the girls, I love 'em love 'em baby!
Black diamonds and pearls, ooh yeah yeah
If I ruled the world, whoa yeah
If I ruled the world

Now I rule the world and now, I'm on top
And I'm rollin' with folks that could never be stopped
And I'm here to let you know this is where I belong
And to you sucker emcees that sing my song
And it's a song that's strong about right and wrong
And I'm rock it to you baby baby all night long
And it's a song about love, and happiness
In a world of peace, and you know that's fresh
Now I'm the king, and I want you to know
That I'm the Master Blaster Rapper who's runnin' the show

And to all of you rappers in every country
You better stop what you're doin', and listen to me
'Cause we gotta stop war, and use unity
To fight crime and hunger and poverty
'Cause the African baby is dyin' overseas
While you sucker mission politicians bustin' out Z's
Huh, twenty million people all unemployed
While the rich man try to play Pretty Boy Floyd
While the working class just struggles hard
Try to make ends meet against all odds
While the poor man can't even deal with life
You know he tried to escape, and smoked the coke on the pipe

And it's time for a change, to a better way
'Cause the sun has gotta shine through the cloudy day
So listen up world, while I teach this class
And take heed to the message or we ain't gonna last
'Cause I know, the solution, is the contribution
Of woman and man to just join the revolution
That'll take your brain to a higher plane
And help you deal in a world that's gone insane
With the problems that I know we can stop
From the ruler of the world and the man on top
But the years went by, and time was up
And the ruler of the world had ran out of luck
And all the people at the time who said they were my friends
Didn't know me when my job had come to an end
They came up to my face, as happy as can be
He was running his mouth like, Muhammad Ali
So I shook his hand calmly as I headed to the door
On my way to the ghetto to treat once more

If I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls, I love 'em love 'em baby!
Black diamonds and pearls, ooh yeah yeah
If I ruled the world, yeah
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls, I'd love 'em love 'em baby!
Black diamonds and pearls, ooh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
If I ruled the world, whoa yeah
If I ruled the world, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
	
I'd love all the girls, you know I'd love 'em love 'em baby!
Diamonds and pearls, ooh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
If I ruled the world, yeah yeah yeah yeah baby baby
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls, yes you, you, you and you
Black diamonds and pearls, where those diamonds, where those pearls?
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls, I'd love 'em love 'em baby",If I Ruled the World,1985

As I lay sleeping
I dreamt I held you in my arms

Joy and pain are like sunshine and rain
Joy and pain are like sunshine and rain

Love can be bitter, love can be sweet
Sometimes devotion and sometimes deceit
The ones that you care for give you so much pain

Listen, don't it seem we go through life going up and down
Seems the things that turn you on turn you around
Always hurting each other if it ain't one thing it's another
When the world is down on you love's somewhere around
And I want you to know that

Joy and pain are like sunshine and rain

Kurtis Blow,"'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house
Hold it now! Wait, hold it. That's played out. Hit it!

Don't you give me all that jive about things you wrote before I's alive
'Cause this ain't 1823 -- ain't even 1970
Now I'm the guy named Kurtis Blow and Christmas is one thing I know
So every year just about this time, I celebrate it with a rhyme

Gonna shake it, gonna bake it, gonna make it good
Gonna rock shock clock it through your neighbourhood
Gonna read, gonna sing it till it's understood
My rappin' bout to happen like a knee you've been slapping
Or a toe you've been tapping on a hunk of wood

Bout a red-suited dude with a friendly attitude
And a sleigh full of goodies for for the people on the block
Got a long white beard, maybe looks kind a weird
And if you ever see him, he could give you quite a shock

Now people let me tell ya bout last year
When the dude came flying over here
Well, the hog was out, snow's on the ground
Folks stayed in to party down
The beat was thumping on the box, and I was dancing in my socks
And the drummer played at a solid pace
And a taste of the bass was in my face
And the guitar player layed down a heavy layer
Of the funky junky rhythm of the disco beat
And the guy with the 88's started to participate
And I could sure appreciate a sound so sweat

We were all in the mood so we had a little food
And a joke, and a smoke, and a little bit of wine
When I thought I heard a hoof on the top of the roof
Could it be or was it me? I was feeling super fine
So I went to your attic where I thought heard the static
On the chance that the prance was somebody breaking in
But the noise on the top was a reindeer clop
Just a trick St. Nick, and I let the sucker in

He was roly, he was poly, and I said, ""Holy moly!
You got a lot of whiskers on your chinny chin chin""
He allowed he was proud of the hairy little crowd
On the point of his jaw where the skin should've been
Gets cool for a fool going out every Yule
For a day on a sleigh when the cold went low
So the beard may be weird but I'll never have it sheared
'Cause it's warm in the storm when it's ten below

I said, ""You're right, it's cold tonight
But can you stop for a drop before you go?""
He said, ""Why not if the music's hot?
And I'll chance a dance beneath the mistletoe""
So he went downstairs and forgot his guests
And he rocked the spot and danced like a pro
And every young girl tried to rock his world
But he boogie oogie oogied til he had to go

And before he went, this fine old gent
Brought a gift with a sift through his big red bags
In the top or the bottom, he reached in and got 'em
Toys for the boys, for the girls glad rags
And the grownups got some presents too
A new TV and a stereo
A new Seville bout as blue as the sky
The best that money couldn't buy
'Cause money could never ever buy the feeling
The one that comes from not concealing
The way you you feel about your friends
And this is how the story ends

The dude in red's back at the Pole
Up north where everything is cold
But if he were right here tonight
He'd say, Merry Christmas and to all a good night",Christmas Rappin',1994

I see you standing here 
Oh baby how I miss you 
And how much I need to kiss you 
Run my fingers through your hair 
But then again it's just my imagination 
Being close to you was such a sweet sensation 
But then we had to have that terrible confrontation 

Daydreamin' takes me where I want to be 
Daydreamin' lets me have you here with me 

Oh girl if you knew all that I've been going through 
You'd have a change of heart 
But come rain or shine you're foverer on my mind 
Of my life you're the part 
But then again,it's just my imagination 
Being close to you was such a sweet sensation

Bruv you think ure white you think ure black
Well let me tell you this you just won wack



",Hey Everybody,2005
Kurtis Blow,"This here's a tail for all the fellas
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down cause ya over-zealous
Play hard to get females get jealous
Okay smarty go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next days function high class luncheon
Food is served and you're stone-cold munchin'
Music comes on people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walking guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance cause she likes to groove
So come on fatso and just bust a move

You're on a mission and your wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls just ugly faces
From frustration first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself, with a celibate rope
Your movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin' in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says ""Hello,
come sit next to me you fine fellow.""
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next hey bust a move

In this city ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, ""No way""
Girls are fakin' goodness sakin'
They want the man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no women and there you are
Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Lookin' for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on a beach perpetrating a tan
So a brother with the money can be their man
So on the beach you're strollin' real high rollin'
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove
So don't just stand there bust a move

Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry
In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can
Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man
You say neat-o, check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting
So you start thinkin' then you start blinking
The bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking
She thinks your kinda cute so she winks back
And now your feelin' really fine cause the girl is stacked
Reception's jumpin' bass is pumpin'
You look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'
Says she wants to dance to a different groove
Now you know what to do G bust a move",Bust A Move,2010

Kurtis Mantronik,"Diamonds are forever, they are all I need to please me
They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me
 
Diamonds are forever, hold one up and then caress it
Touch it, stroke it and undress it
I can see ev'ry part, nothing hides in the heart to hurt me
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, sparkling round my little finger
Unlike men, the diamonds linger
Men are mere mortals who are not worth going to your grave for
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, forever, forever
",Diamonds Are Forever [Mantronik 007 Mix],1995
Kurtis Mantronik,"Try to answer to the master or the MC rap God is no joke
On the lyric, its hard to be modest
I knew I was the man with the master plan
To make you wiggle and jiggle, like gelatin
Just think while I sink, into the brain structure
(don't sleep on the e) you see, something might rupture
I don't take time for me to blow your mind
Take a second to wreck it because you're dumb and blind
So just lounge, cause you're a MC clown
Go join the circus, EPMD in town

Total chaos, no mass confusion
Rhymes so hypnotizing known to cause an illusion
Like a magician, who pulls a rabbit out a hat, son
I pull them all like a .44 magnum
MC freeze stop look and listen, and try to imagine
Its traveling the speed of light, but everything's motion
Is frightening, plus the thought you alone
You now enter dimension, called the twilight zone
You're terrified, plus you cant bear the thought
You and I one-on-one, in the land of the lost
You start to shiver, but then you scream, my friend
Yo wake up muttley, because you're dreaming again
But next time I'm on the scene, do not try to diss us
Keep your mouth shut sucker duck, because I'm strictly business

This is the rap season, where the e starts pleasing
Girls around the world no need to be skeezing
When I roll I stroll, cool always pack a tool
Just in case, a brother acts a fool
Ive got the energy, to put the girls in the frenzy
Put it in shock when I rock, give it up I'm not stingy
Make sure I don't bore when I'm on the dance floor
(get busy, boy) like you never saw before
Rhyme flow, good to go, after the show, Ill pull your hoe, boy
(Yo, you sniff blow? ), hell no!
I got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffing
And my parents find out, then they start riffing
So I stay, a-okay, cause I'm the e, the r-I-c-k

MC's look me in my face, then their eyes get weak
Pulse rate descends, heart rate increases
Its like beam me up, scotty, I control your body
I'm as deadly as aids when its time to rock a party
And all due respect, when I say mic check
Let a sucker slide once, then I break his neck
So when I say jump, you reply, how high?
Because I'm taking no prisoners, so don't play hero and die
Cause you're a soldier, and I'm a green beret
I do not think twice about the MC's I slay
So if you want to battle, I highly recommend this
Bring your dog, mom, and dad, because I'm strictly business

Yo yo, you're still picking on that four-leaf clover?
Bring in the sandman, sucker, because its over
My name is Erick Sermon and I'm back again
I see the heads still turning and my so-called friends
They smile in my face, behind my back they talk trash
Mad and stuff, because they don't have cash
Like the e-double, or the PMD
He drives a corvette, I drive a samurai Suzuki
I'm a locksmith, with the key to fame
Never high on myself, always stay the same
Play a lot because I'm hot, like a horse I trot
Around the track and back, fatigued? no, I'm not

Well I'm the mellow, the fellow, the one who likes to say hello
To a fly girl that is good to go
With the slow tempo, and the off-beat rhyme flow
Cause when I am in action, there is no time for maxing
Or relaxing, just subtracting and reacting
On a sucker MC who mouth keeps on yapping and flapping
I lose my cool, then Ill start slapping and smacking
You wanna roll? then Albee start jacking and capping
No time to lounge, I'm packing and strapping
At my point of attack I soar at you like an eagle
I'm the sheriff, and biting is illegal
So next time I'm in town, I highly recommend this
You gots to chill, because I'm strictly business",Strictly Business,1999

Ain't nothing but a gangsta party
Break out the champagne glasses

Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm ""Losing My Religion"", I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missing
Niggas be acting like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I got, nothing but love, for my niggas living lavish

I got a pit named P, she niggarino
I got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I, think I got a black Beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Seagel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up, by the little homie in the Regal
It feel good to you baby bubba
Ya see, this is for the G's and the keys motherfucker

Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the West side
And I can make you famous

Bow down in the presence of a boss player

Everybody in the party doing dope slanging
You got to have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch, before your eyes swirl
Ya doing ya job, every day
And then you work so hard til ya hair turn gray
Let me tell you about life, and bout the way it is
You see we live by the gun, so we die by the gun's kids

They tell me not to roll with my glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floating in the black Benz, trying to do a show a day
They wonder how I live, with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill, on my block
Schemes for currency and doe related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm trying to get up on it
My nigga dogg with me, eternally the most wanted

Now imagine yourself in a bottomless pit 
with no way your climbin out, and this ain't the punishment 
Deadly as crystal crack, how should I react 
with intentions to keep on mashin, strap to strap 
Is this my boundary from county to county? 
Your homies want to try to soak me like Bounty? 
Dogg Poung Gangsta all day all night 
Partyin like a motherfuckin now all night 
But uhh, simple as fact I been wantin to serve your whole fuckin crew

I hold it down for the two and I'll be gunned down by no one

Give a FUCK whatcha name is, I tell ya quick 
Face to face, punk you can eat a dick 
Cause you're all out of time, out of sight 
out of mind, somethin I wouldn't do without a nine 
I got a pocket full of papers and a trunk full of beat 
Mashin all through the streets rollin wit some heat 
I'm heated, repeat it, day after day 
Daily survival tactics in L.A. 
I'm on point and alert 
with skills like a huntin expert, fuck around and get hurt 
Lurked, I puts in work like a chemist 
Mentally known to cause motherfuckin dilemmas 
See me in black and beware 
It's a Dogg Pound Gangsta on the loose out there 
Now here's the kickoff, as I'm about to rip off 
Rage is knockin lips off, travellin like a spitball, I hit y'all 
Right between the eyes, smack dab in the middle 
with my rhymes or my riddles, ain't got no time to fiddle 
faddle, dibble, dabble 
Gotta Rock like Fraggle

Fuck around and you'll get chipped off like the Sphinx 
Think, about it, better yet forget it 
Uhh, play like En Vogue cause you're never gonna get it 
The style, the flavor, the flow, the so-lo-ist 
Hit you in a second, one two mic checkin 
That's my lethal weapon like a chain and ball

You trippin' on your girl cause she showed me love
Nigga don't beat em, cause if you beat em, you don't need em
You lay your hands on me, watch how fast I take your freedom
I delete em, but don't mistreat em
I stay up on em, and that's one ta grow on, 
Let me flow on
You can rock to tha rythme you see 
or you can rock to tha rythme of me
Just remember when you do your thang,
Make sure you do your thang on a hang
And everythang, is everythang
There ain't no mo' than this paper chase
Like them white-boy DA's was on tha case
You know I ain't tryin' ta floss, but uh,
(Murder, murder, murder) was the case that they lost
I'm Tha DoggFather

Now, do anybody in tha house remember
When there wasn't no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)
There wasn't no rappers hollin' 'bout LBC
Am I trippin' ya'll? (Hell no!)
Now, when I grow up, I want to be like Snoop
Have prestigious women 
That's the truth from the beginning
In and out of the fliest hotels
You say your family don't know me
Hold on hommie, that's foremost and promos
Sales, tails, scales and jails
Success before death
No one in my clique fails
As females with the almighty Father lead
Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need
And it ain't no party like this kind, 
Cause you can leave your worries behizzind
But I'ma git back to tha grizzind
Snoop D-O double G comin' back for mizzine and
I'm tha DoggFather

To leave motherfuckers in a daze, fucked up

Want to take a ride in my 7-8 Coupe, DeVille
Chill, as I take you on a trip
Where them niggas ride, and slide, you know about the East Side
Niggas like myself, here to show you where it's at
With my hoes on my side, and my strap on my back
Papers I stack daily, and Death Row is still the label that pays me
But you know how that goes
We flow toe for toe, if you ain't on the Row
Fuck you and your hoe, really doe, so check it
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg on the solo tip
Still clockin' grip, and really don't give a shit
About nothin' at all, just my Doggs, steppin' through the fog
And I'm still gonna fade em all
With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hangin'
How many hoes in ninety-four will I be bangin'?
Every single one, to get the job done
As I dip, skip, flip, right back to two one
Where the sun be shinin' and I be ryhmin'
It's me, Snoop D-O-double-G, and I'm climbin'

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I come creepin' through the fog with my saggin' Dukes
East Side, Long Beach, in a 7-8 Coupe DeBille
I'm rollin' with the G Funk, bumpin' in my shit and it don't quit
So drop it on the one motherfucker put together that set
A nigga with a grip of that gangsta shit
With the Eastside hoes on my motherfuckin' dick
And the Compton niggas all about to set trip
Swing it back, bring it back, just like this
And if you with my shit, then blaze up another spliff
And keep the motherfuckin' blunt in your pocket loc
Cause Doggy Dogg is all about the zig zag smoke
See it's a West coast thing, where I'm from
And if you want some, get some, bad enough, take some
But watch the gun by my side
Because it represents me and the motherfuckin' East Side
So bow down to the bow wow, cause bow wow
Yippie yo, you can't see my flow
My shit is dope, original, now you know
And can't no hood fuck with Death Rizzow

Blowin Saki part one, gettin buckwild
With some hoes from the other side of the globe
I mean this bitch pussy so tight it's fittin like a glove
Could it be a small case of puppy love you see?
(Snoop Doggy I love you) Hey bitch you ain't in love with me

Now if I fucked yo' bitch, would a nigga trip?
Did you know your ho's goin round blowin niggas dicks?
Now would you trip? Now trip I can, I go back
To when me and Daz was chillin in Atlanta
Atlanta was the place to be, see it was bitches and shit
We had a, show to go do down at the FreakNik, we had a
Bitch, that was all up on our dicks
'Cause she knew about the homey and she knew about the Click

And I respond to the pussy like, what's happenin?
And you can fuck me, and fuck my cousin
And fuck Nate
Then fuck everyone of my motherfuckin homies, in the DPG
Shhhh)

Now I'd only satisfy you to fulfill my needs
The ho get to suckin, five minutes later be get to fuckin
Now the ho shocked, me just slipped off the rubber
I said OOOH (oooh), NOO (noo)

My mind starts tripping
A tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they breaking trying to save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live?
(Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dream of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son)
My eyes are closed

Murder, murder was the case that they gave me

I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
(Just remember who changed your mind
Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe, check it out

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

Preferably in a residential area

Now I'ma kick up dust
As I begin to bust
On the wick-wack, fucked up suckers you can't trust
When I pick up I lick up, ya face get smacked up
When I rack up, so all you motherfuckers just pack up
Or get slapped with the swiftness
If you think you're swift then forget Merry Christmas
Now stuff that in your stocking
I'm knocking em out the box 'n'
Knocking em out their sock 'n'
'Cause Robin is rocking
Breaking em down to the slab
Taking em down on their ass
Now what you wanna do? Ya wanna battle, huh?
See ya watch and creak without a motherfucking paddle
Rattle that brain, I'm not that same ol' plain Jane
Roll on you like a boulder, you're nothing more than a grain
Or a pebble, take it from the real rap rebel
Not Bushwick Bill but I can take it to that other level
You think you got pull then pull it!
I got the trigger so I figure you'll bite the bullet
Then bite the dust and what the fuck
Do what I must and what I must is bust
The bubble or choose some trouble, forty-due's
So stick to my Luger, Lady of Rage is coming through

(Some cool shit, some cool shit)

I fears no one, I makes em cool off like a polar cap
Lynching as I hits, misses the rolling back?
Pushing packs to make a profit
Diggy dope stuck on the topic so stop and gimme my pops, kid
I'm living large like a fat bitch
So get back, bitch, I'm hard to broke art so the faggots
This young black kid, I'm mercenary, merciless
Murdering mega some niggas so who's first to diss
They say I'm bad so you'll find none worst than this
Chewing motherfuckers up like a Hershey Kiss
Put to sleep, ripping the lyrics I'm leaving
Rough wind flex too complex, wrecks, then I'm peace
So feel the wrath, nigga, I rip in half niggas
Ya quick to talk shit I whip your ass nigga
So watch me blast, nigga, cause I'm the last nigga
Ya wanna fuck wit, so up your cash, nigga
I make stagger, ob' skills and jimmy ragged
Home in and drag her, sit wit ya girl and watch me tag her
Pulling steel like a stunt
Sold like an ID card, nigga, no needs to front, so
Here to torment up a track on crack
And I'm strapped witta semi-toll milli-ten Mac
Yo, I breaks em off, I breaks em off cheap
Deadly as Jason on Friday The 13th

Back in the days, niggas they use to scrap
But now in '92, niggas they pull they strap
'Cause, umm, police them come wicked and dem shoot
Niggas, so niggas retaliate and start to loot
Execute, boom, stomping black soldier
Here to teach and mould ya
The ennerator, dominator, narrator RB to the motherfucking X
Flex wicked styl-e, bomping be found into greed by a
Maniac with a gat
See nowadays niggas is like that
I pull my trigger back, the bullets go
Bop, bop, bop now I'm on Death Row
Fuck it, niggas going wild, every night they shoot
It's like Beirut
Maybe you should get a Teflon vest for your chest
Anytime ya step into my hood
But that'll do you no good
One slug to ya face, no hate, you getting smoked like wood
Nasty nigga but he pumps, lays flat on the concrete

Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby

Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do?  You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches

Off your knees and then start juggling

Kurupt,"You find an MC like me who's strong
Leaving motherfucker's aborted, with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I get deadly as Kahn though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those
Who can withstand, the more power I gain
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck your brain
Imagine and keep on wishing upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstanding, faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced with it, I'm a ride
Breaking in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies

So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facing
We must be patient nothing better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waiting
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that ass shaking
I'm busting and making motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
But thugged out, forgive me Janet
Who's in control I'm activating your souls
You know, the way the games get controlled
You, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fucking rhyme I wrote
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat

I got my mind made up, come on (come on)
Get in get in too (get on it)
Let it ride (get wit it) tonight's the night
I got my mind made up, come on
Get in get in too
Let it ride tonight's the night

Well I come through with two packs
Of the bomb prophalaks for protection
So my fucking sac won't collapse
Cause nowadays, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifying like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfucking poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's the fucking bom-bay
Your got dissed, that's before it's ingest like balmay
My rhymes, I leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly vibes spread through your head like sand pine
There's no escape, nah I ain't blasting
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those asking
Opposed to laughing, raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killing
Why is that? 'cause smiling faces deceive
You best believe, to MC's I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under seige, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe, your vocab on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
Your already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat

Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler, sticking up (Jews) with German (lugers)
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this mess-age don't touch the dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket blow!
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellen
Half of my Clan's three deep felons
Niggas best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical then touch Tical
All up in your motherfucking mouth
Head banger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man roll too tight, you can pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and falling fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast

Hey yo, lyrical gas spitting the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this, mad underground basement, shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor who? Spock bitch don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless, the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust till every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out till your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
With, this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Then proceeds like keys
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit your fam' by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake or a snake bust it
I'm the one pushing the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke, off this anecdote got you ope
Get roast, by my lyrics Billy Dee .45 Colt
And I'm out for nine nickel (INS the rebels)

Kurupt,"Ay what time is it nigga?
(""I don't know."") Oh shit, 12 o'clock
Oh shit, we got to get the fuck up outta here
(""Hell yeah."") Nigga, it's check out time nigga
Hey call up Kurupt, call Daz room (""Hey there, bitch, where Suge at, nigga?"")
Call Suge, call all the niggas tell 'em to meet me downstairs (""Where K and them niggas at man?"")
Tell the valet, bring the Benz around (""Ay, y'all seen my shoes?"")
Hey Kurupt, y'all niggas drivin or y'all flyin' back, whassup?
(""Man, I'm rollin' man, fuck that shit."")
Hey Syke nigga, come on man, get up out the bathroom fool
(""Fuck that, I lost some money, nigga."") Aw nigga
Damn

Now I'm up early in the mornin', breath stinkin' as I'm yawnin'
Just another sunny day in California
I got my mind focused on some papers while I'm into sexy capers
Give a holla to them hoochies last night, that tried to rape us
Will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a boss playa, death before I let these bitches break us
Last night was like a fantansy, Alizé and Hennessy
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin' with my man and me
Told her I was interested, picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch
First you argued, then I fight it, til you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited, it don't matter, just don't bite it
I never got to check out the scence
Too busy tryin' to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems, it's check out time

We gotta go  (gotta go, gotta go)
We gotta go (yeah baby) (it's check it out time)
We gotta go (let's go nigga, gotta go)
We gotta go (Y'all know what time it is!) (Ay, c'mon man get y'all bags man)
We gotta go (call that valet motherfucker, tell him to get a nigga shoe)
We gotta go ('cause we out this, motherfucker)

They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
My fantansies came true with Janet on, I'm in a escapade
But did it all, end too soon
All the homies runnin' through the halls room to room
So I assume, since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
My game's trump tight, so I find time to recline
Sneak in your room, instant Messiah, shit wines of all kinds
I ain't got that much time
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night, I got to get you hot and heated
Play like Micheal Jackson, and beat It
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out
'Cause there's someone else who deserves my attention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
'Cause bustin' bitches is a hobby, nigga
It's check out time

We gotta go (ayo man Pac ay)
We gotta go (where the where the fuck is Daz at man?)
We gotta go (This nigga locked up or somethin'?)
We gotta go (The only one not to leave) (yo man)
We gotta go (it's check out time it's time to get out this mother)
We gotta go (You seem them bitches?)
We gotta go (We out man, fuck that shit)
We gotta go (Yo Rece!)
We gotta go (Yo nigga, whassup, whassup?)

Hey I'm livin' the life of a boss playa
The front desk callin' but I'm checkin' out later
My behaviour is crazy from what you did to me baby
If walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me
I'm puttin' in work, but didn't hurt from the jacuzzi to the bed
Carressin' your thoughts, 'cause I'm livin' Fed
Heard what I said? Passion is crashin' the room
From the liquor we consumed I heard a boom
I'm blackin' out, you're yellin' out 'Big Syke Daddy'
We did it in the caddy on the highway, my way
I'm lost in a dream and so it seemed, to be the night
Five bottles of Cristal and I'm still tight
Out of sight from Pac and Kurupt
As I get it up, once the doors close, you stuck
In a heaty, sticky situation
Get up baby, you ain't on vacation
It's check out time

We gotta go
We gotta go (Ay, it's check out time)
We gotta go (Ay Pac, nigga where my motherfuckin')
We gotta go (where my shoes go, nigga?)
We gotta go (where my motherfuckin' drawers and shit at man?)
We gotta go (Man, y'all niggas was in here partyin' too fuckin' much)
We gotta go (What the fuck y'all doin', nigga? Kurupt!)
We gotta go (go tell Daz, man, and Bogart and the rest of them niggas, c'mon man)
Niggas is trippin' man
Front desk all callin' me, tellin' me to get the hell outta here, man
We gotta go (I ain't got no more money, somebody loan me a hundred)
We gotta go
We gotta go
We gotta go
We gotta go
We gotta go
We gotta go
We gotta go

We gotta go, ooh
We gotta go
We, hey
We
We gotta go, ho
We gotta go uh
Hmm yeah yeah, hey hey",Check Out Time,1996
Kurupt,"Verse One: Daz
You find an MC like me who's strong
Leavin motherfucker's aborted, with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I gets deadly as Kahn though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those 
Who can withstand, the mo' power I gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
Imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin, faded
would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard, I'm faced with it, I'm a ride
breakin in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies...

Verse Two: Tupac
So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin
We must be based on nothin better than communication
Known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waitin
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that asss shakin
I'm bustin and makin motherfuckers panic
Don't take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
but thugged out, forgive me Janet
Who's in control I'm acvtivatin yo souls
You know, the way the games get controlled
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin rhyme I wrote
Takin off my coat, clearing my throat

Chorus: Method Man
I got my mind made up, come on... [come on]
get in get in too [get on it]
let it ride [get wit it] tonight's tha night
I got my mind made up, come on...
get in get in too
let it ride... tonight's tha night

Verse Three: Kurupt
Well I comes through with two packs
of the bomb prophalaks for protection
So my fuckin sac won't collapse
Cause nowaday's, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electryfing like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's tha fuckin bom-bay
Ya got dissed, that's before it's ingest like balmay
My rhymes, I leave a mark on ya mind
As the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pine
There's no escape, nah I ain't blastin
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin
Opposed to laughin, raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
Why is that? 'cause smilin faces decieve
You best believe, to MC's I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
Ya whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe, your vocab on site
I'm out tha cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
Ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat

Verse Four: Method Man
Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
like Hitler, stickin up [jews] wit german [lugers]
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this mess-age don't touch tha dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket -- blaooow!!
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellen
Half of my Clan's three deep felons
Niggaz best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man I stay on point like icicles
Now who want to test Tical then touch Tical
All up in your motherfuckin mouth
Head banger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man roll too tight, you can pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast

Verse Five: Redman
Aiyyo, lyrical gas spittin tha criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this, mad underground basement, shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on ya whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor who? Spock bitch don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
to get the fresh package of bless, tha dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from tha rear block
to bust til every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold ya nose and blow out til ya ears pop
Since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
With, this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Then proceeds like keys
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
I'm the one pushin the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked

You know  all we got to do is kick it 
We gonna kick it in our hood  you know 
What we gonna do we might 

We might go kill a couple of niggaz mane 
You know  go in they hood and do a drive by 
Then come back in the hood and laugh about that stuff 
You know it's just a thing 

Only how you really gonna get deep into it 
Is when one of your homeys die 
Just like when my partnaz died 
(we got some problems) 

[Chorus] 
First we pray, then we ride 
First we pray, then we ride 

He was my brother 
Loved him like no other 
To top it off 
I introduced him to this game 
I knew his mother 
Loved her like my mother 
Part of me is gone 
Bout take my brother home 

(what're ya gonna do) 
When the trials come 
(are ya gonna run?) 
Are you gonna run? 
(what're ya gonna do) 
First I'm gonna pray

And I ain't got nuthin but love for my muthafuckin dogs

Beware here I come with the DPG on my chest 
Heat gonna spit like Elliot Ness 
In the darkest zone you feel alone and on your own 
And after I bust, niggaz call me Kurupt Coleone 

All I'm about is money, loot and cash 
Homeys in the DPG Nate, Snoop and Daz 
Now with these emotions how you approach yourself 
Knowin you all about your wealth and as it is to health 

First I pray, get my thoughts intact 
Ask for forgiveness 'cause I'm bout to lay this nigga flat 
Can you adapt, can you feel me, I doubt it 
'Cause the closest you see it, is when niggaz write about it 

I can't live without it and it ain't shit I could do 
But stay down with the homeys in grey and blue 
So just keep the heat close in hand 
'Cause I done see niggaz get shit while they homeboys ran 

Heavenly father shine your light on me 
I know I promise to slow down on this weed 
Seems I remember someone used to say 
One life gets taken, if you take one life away 

(what're ya gonna do) 
When the trials come 
(are ya gonna run?) 
Are you gonna run?

All I want to do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

It's structures to this game, it's instinct mixed with knowledge
I'm a player in the game and I know not from college
Eyes open, focus, scopin out the scene
Watch the gangsta haters close 'cause they worse than dope fiends
I hope things get better for you
Cause I'ma make things get better for me
And keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB
The L-L-G wit DPG by the sea
We ride at high tide, the East is my side
I'ma tell you 'long as my voice is recordable
That plan you got ain't gonna work you better audible
Oh yes I'm fresh and like spy from existence
Wit persistence I perceive
To supply you wit what you need, no room for greed
Better go around and when it come to you
Don't bite off more than you can chew
Respect the game and the game will respect you back
Game is life, life is struggle
Without the coastal juggle
So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crsytal
(Will you get mad and go pull out your pistol?)
Or will you be a man and pick up all the pieces
And put it back together and remain tougher than leather
As for me I'm trying to keep it real Dogg
All I want to do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

But let's pick up the litter, LB young nigga
I need solar on my Dogg nall, I bark when it get dark
Bitches in heat we tear the beat up, what?
On the microphone I bury the bone
Always, strays try to follow me home
To get the pooper scooper, why? They dropping doo-doo
I'm stepping on shit, lift up the bottom of my shoe
See I'm smashing full-breaded wit no leash
When I mob, make marks across the street
See I'm vicious like hell, got em waggin they tail
For the bow-wow LBC style
Hit you like the Dogg bopper fever, I fetch paper
On the receiver, go get it like a retriever
I want em close enough so I can lock on em
With the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on em
Check this out here man, I lick em, sick em
Man's bestfriend, I hit you for ten, 
Fleas can't seize my pack, what what's my name?
Major trick we're hitting licks like a doberman gang
Why'done trip and try to fuck me up ever since a young puppy
Run a cat up a tree, nigga it's DPG

[Chorus: x2]

They say once upon a time in the land of the loccs
Where it's all about dope and pistol smoke
I packs me a heavy calibre .38 revolver
We'd out, Dp'd out, GC'd out
Oh, did you not know
Snoop wit the .44 knocking at'cha door
We the passion for smashing and mashing the masses
Knocking niggas like cash is, Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin
It's like in a action
Cause for the cash in my own zone we known for blasting
Busting, no need for discussion
We don't discuss, we stay close as 10 inches then bust
Close enough to touch then rush
Clean and radical and get clutch

With a Mack 11 cocked back ready for sure, ready for war

Savagely attack this, clash with, accurate aim
Spark the flame, burn this inside the vein
Ride tracks like the soul train, hold ya brain
In the state of shock, make em drop hits of cocaine

Spit rounds on the floor, evidence of the war
It's on til the death til we settle the score

Transmit def styles with sign language in braille
In hot pursuit of donald trump rap loot
Produce what you feel with navy seal mic troops
Spark the s-p, slaughter, pete rock of gibraltar
Miraculous lyrics that tread water
A rap nigga, show respect, write rhymes that connect
Collaborate, break bread with kurupt and deck
Keep my feet blessed, fresh with the scottie pippen's
In the game of life, I play all positions
Stop look and listen, total package, yes a true master
Produce rhymes, slang hits faster
The master of the game, solo artist by name
Paint the masterpiece that lies inside the frame
Passionate bright colors, the number one soul brother
All eyes on us, guard your grill and take cover

I'm the epicenter of this natural disaster
I'm disastrous with smashes, cold and hot flashin
Masters of self, a whole carload of explosives
Like zorro your host is
Death with the intellect from wizards to warlocks
I'm sore ock, I'm raw ock with four glocks, smallpox
More ways to get paid, more ways to display
More rhymes to say, more ak's to spray
God is good growin up in the hood
Done some things bad, done some things good
Me and pete is like rhymes to chemicals, clash
Atom bombs to mustard gas
We intervene, I break ya, take ya to a whole difference scene
Are-15's and beams
Got em jumpin like I swallowed a gang of jumpin beans
Explode and reload, we dumps machines
Radical in war, kurupt's a mad star
I'm a hard dogg, raw dogg, hog with the gold paw
Dogg pound gangstaz -- d.p.g.
I'm a dogg pound gangsta -- d.p.g.
I'm a dogg pound gangsta -- d.p.g.

Stick him for his notes roll hundred spokes
Raw dogg it's all about the money now
This ain't no riddle don't giggle like it's funny now
What you got my cash?

Get the Glock stop cock pop & dash
Move where the homies got they end they coulda had
And everybody's down for the muthafuckin' mash
What you 'bout to blaze up?
Oh it's like that all of the homies is posted up in the back
You comin' to the gangsta reunion Kurupt & 'Cat
Wonderin' where all the muthafuckin' G's at
All I see is switches niggas hittin Swishers
Niggas high as the sky & niggas gettin bitches

Living my life hustlin' strugglin' & partyin'
Under Pressure (we all are) Under Pressure
I'm a bet I'm not a rookie like Mack 10 said
""Gangstas don't dance we boogie""
Off to another corridor & that's for sure
Drop a nigga to the floor I'm spectaculaur
Ay girl, seen you lookin' at me from afar
While I'm over here just wonderin' who you are
I'm a tan khaki wearin' blue khaki wearin'
Brand new khaki wearin' muthafucka from the Pound
Hop in the MC (Monte Carlo) chrome M3
Case niggas is comin' after me burst then flee
I separate the real from the fake
As easy as it is to make mistakes I'ma give it all it takes
I'ma hit ya spot like shell shock
And take all there is to take
Turn & make his fuckin' chest quake
Life is simple just get yo' cash
And don't do shit unless ya down to blast
[Chorus]
Violence needs to silence
They call it no sense we call it self defense
They makin' all the cash but we ain't makin' none
All they got is bullshit but we ain't takin' none
They said the panties dropped
Do 'em nigga what's poppin'?
Is it mines or yours?
Nigga it's all of ours
Play everyday holla at my nigga Dre
(Yo we about to bounce?)
Naw blaze up a ounce
What's up my name's Kurupt
They call me Young Gotti
You want to party I'm out to catch a body
They say I shine but I don't feel like a star
Always tryin' to play niggas like guitars
Just do it baby do it baby do it
It ain't nothin' to it I spit it like fluid
Spit fluently fluent,
Fluent enough for you to understand
What the fuck a nigga was doin'

You shot my girlfriend when she was 3 months 
There went my children found out it was more than one 
You've got me limping and I can't move as fast 
But I swear on baby grave that I'm gonna get that ass

As much as I been feelin' and dreamin' this mutha fuckers mine 
I let my heat fly, I see him fallin' down 
And all I'm hearing is ""K-Plaw, K-Plaw, Paw Paw"" 
After the smoke clears I hear a baby screamin' 
I'm tryin' to make out but all I see is demons 
Father forgive me if I hurt this child let me die tonight 
Walk up to the Beemer see the kids alright 
I hand him to his cryin' mama tell her turn away 
Somebody punched up daddy's number and it's Judgement Day

When I throw a style, you better duck 
And if you don't your ass is out of luck 
Don't fuck with the master if I have to

Why you have to be like this, me and the mic's tight 
Like lettuce, lighting the pimps

If your style's wack then you need to get that shit fixed 
Brothers hittin Jersey, my raps hitting harder than bricks

I'm mannish - get yo' nails out my back
Slut I'm bout to nut and get up, go scrub yo' cat
Learn the player rules, this is how I play a dude
Might not be a freak, but she got on the choosin shoes
Dollar signs are folded, I can't control it
Tryin to leave her, beeper just exploded
She sweatin me, won't let me, broad turned fraud
Now she on this dick huh, got her turnin tricks huh
Man it's a trip I don't trip I'm in yo' Lexus flexin

Prettier to grittier, the wittier can get her

That's when I caught a Vision like Coleco
A high-post ho, a perfect way for me to keep dough
Huh, have her sellin ass on Bronson Ave. and Pico

At the ho-tel, mo-tel, or the Holiday Inn (say what nigga?)
I said if that bitch keep fuckin up (beotch) then we'll fuck her friends
I said I dip, dive, what can I say?
Niggas need to stop fuckin with O.J
Some niggas bang Blood, some niggas bang Crip
And bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
I had to dream of hoes, I had to scream at hoes

If you blew my balls, right through my drawers
Come back to the mansion, chill at the spot
From the way she was blowin, I know she does it a lot
I have a eight-and-a-half, nine-and-three-quarters
The ho started callin when I started boss ballin
Gimme some head, gimme some ass (uh-huh)
Gimme some cash, pass it to Daz
Pass it to Snoop, or pass it to Nate
See hoes eat dick like eggs and steak
It ain't shit new, I thought you knew (what?)
I knew you would, you wish you could
Break a G down, break me down
But I'mma see you on the rebound (what what?) D.P. style

What nigga. 
Just a nigga from the motherfuckin streets..",Ghetto Millionaire,1999
Kurupt,"That makes me know that, we we we we're doin
We had the right idea in the beginning
And and we just need to maintain our focus, and elevate
We what we do we update our formulas
We have certain formulas but we update em (oh right)
with the times, and everything y'know
And and so.. y'know
The rhyme style is elevated
The style of beats is elevated
but it's still Guru and Premier
And it's always a message involved

""The real... hip-hop""
""MCing, and DJing.. from your own mind, ya know?""
""I, I guess right now we should start the show""

Who's the suspicious character strapped with the sounds profound
Similar to rounds spit by Derringers
You're in the Terrordome like my man Chuck D said
It's time to dethrone you clones, and all you knuckleheads
Cause MC's have used up extended warranties
While real MC's and DJ's are a minority
But right about now, I use my authority
Cause I'm like the Wizard and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hittin like some double Desert Eagles
Sportin caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtractin all the rappers who lack, over Premier's tracks
Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past, I whup ass
Droppin lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax
And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that
While the world's revolvin, on it's axis
I come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics
The wilderness is filled with this; so many people
searching for false lift, I'm here with the skills you've missed
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
Sort of like the master builder when I make my way home
You know my steez...

""You know my steez"" 
""Let em know, do your thing y'all""   
""Keep it live""
""To the beat y'all""

The beat is sinister, Primo makes you relax
I'm like the minister, when I be lacin the wax
I be bringin salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feelin more power
Stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one, to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines takes flight
The apparatus gets blessed, and suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreadin like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid but still can't make the fuckin grade
How many times are wannabe's gonna lie?
Yo they must wanna fry, they can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness carrying my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holding down the fort
(""You know my steez"" --> Method Man) 
You know my steez...

""Let em know, do your thing y'all""   
""Keep it live""
""You know my steez"" 
""Let em know, do your thing y'all""   
""Keep it live""
""You know my steez"" 
""The mic...""
""Let em know, do your thing y'all""   
""Keep it live""
""You know my steez"" 
""The mic...""
""Let em know, do your thing y'all""   
""Keep it live""
""You know my steez"" 
""The mic...""

On the microphone you know that I'm one of the best yet
Some punks, ain't paid all of their debts yet
Tryin to be fly, ridin high on the jet-set
With juvenile rhymes makin fake-ass death threats
Big deal, like En Vogue, here's something you can feel
Styles more tangible, and image more real
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When it's time to go all out you be like, ""Damn he flipped""
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip, giving you a verbal asswhip
Don't trip it's the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick -- why is the press all on my di-dick?
My style be wilder, than a kamikaze pilot
Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a friggin riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas, yo
Them motherfuckers are harrassable
For I be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond
The mic's either a magic wand
Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Then I grab your palm, no pulse you're gone
And if you thought we'd lose our niche in this rap shit you way wrong
I stay up, I stay on, shine bright, like neon
Your song's, pathetic, synthetic, like Rayon
Fat beats, they play on, want dope rhymes, put me on
Word is bond... you know my steez

You put your own amount of sugar in it
Sweet, sweet love to your taste
To your own specifications
Now tell Kool-Aid, how much you want
How much can you flaunt (Tell em' bitch)
One scoop or two (Yeah)
Sweet, sweet love
When your rolling down the street (Errr!)
On them twenty inches and you ask her how much she want
(How much you want bitch) And you got a beat that goes with it

Sweet, sweet love
And she says I want it all
And you know it's cool-Aid in her tank
And your fixing to ride the stripes away
To sweet, sweet love
Take that thong off (Take it off)
And let me touch your thighs (Touch the pussy)
While we roll, I promise to keep my eyes on the road
While I'm touching that sweet, sweet love
To your specifications, to your gratifications
Yeah Kool-Aid is like an aphrodisiac
Your pleasure is mine
Like when a whore goes out to whore
And bring you back all the money
That's sweet, sweet love
Don't try it and even put some strychnine 
Listen to the pronunciation of strychnine in this cool-Aid
This ain't no Jim Jones thing
This is just sweet, sweet, love

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I met her back in the day
Knew how much the bitch weighed and payed
It was sort of like a masquerade
Fake suede boots and Cadillac coupes swoop the boulevard (Err!)
In hot pursuit and we ain't afraid to shoot
From hotel to motel, for the highest clientele
You and you, I give a fuck how the pussy smell
Heads to tails, the bitch bail with limp
With a hell of a limp, see on that gangsta tip
See-notes, fifties and tens we cashed in
Bought a brand new Benz on gold Lorenzos rims
Anything I want my bitch gon' go out and get it
Hustle round and swear that a real pimp is his business
Who got the floss and ball to rise and fall
If a bitch want to do it she gon' fuck em' all
Dog, dog what up, Kool-Aid pimpin' keep on dippin'
Sippin' yac with a yamp, puttin' hoes on they back
It's like that

Everyone want to know how a pimp can do his thing
 
Ridin' sly, gettin' high
Bitches on the corner sellin' pussy tonight hey!
Everyone want to know how a pimp can do his thing
Ridin' sly, gettin' high
Got plenty of my bitches sellin' pussy tonight hey!

Tapped in with this baller I met, pushin' the Vette
He moved to California said he ain't got searched yet
Ah, she gon' blow ya socks off
And peal them rocks off
Bring em' home to daddy, so saddy
Pimp in the Caddy
Keep my hand on the gun
Cause they got me on the run
Menage trois in the telly
Anaconda all in the belly
She gon' serve four tricks
And suck some more dick

Better than average

Pimp the same ho, ridin' through slow
Blaze through third and first and do what ya do

Pull up and wrap the shotgun

Side, ride, slide provide applied
Upped the supplied supply

Improvise, be saddled up pimpin' hoes worldwide
Smack the bitch, smack the bitch
Take the bitch money, money
That's my grip the bitch get
Shakin' that lil' limp skinny ass body the bitch got
Turnin' the Gotti on the cock
And make the bitch hit the block, I'm tired of these hoes
Now a days fallin' crawlin' ah bitch come on

Show you how to pack heat, drop and 6 4 hop
Cut it up, chop, my homie got it, Tray don't stop
Had them bitches dope fiending like I'm slangin them rocks
Straight from the L we don't take no shit
We off in the cut waitin for y'all niggas to trip

When you in close range you best to duck quick
Or get smashed your last chance to forfeit

Can I ride in your car?
Girl I've gone too far

Nah, that ain't what you need

Yea, next summer
But I'm hungry baby

Yea, just pluck em off
Mothafuck all you hoes
Fuck em all
This is nothing but true game
This stainless thing got stained
The bitch gobble the best 
She won a contest for the best jaws in the west
The homie said, ""Watch my head""
But instead, I got a 45 caliber lead spitta
A nigga feelin bitter
Shitty as some kitty litter
Take off, got a Adolf Hitler
Center of attraction
Multiplications then subtractions
From the blast then the smash and the cash and the credit
The bitch on my dick
I'm like bitch, forget it
Let it loose bitch, won't you let it
For ????? I get a bad bitch from Connecticut
A typical hoe
I'm only in it for the blow
The bitch was only in it for the blow
I gave her some blow then let her blow
Then she turned blue
On the speed I grabbed the heater and then flew

Smokin until the sun come out

Now all salute the supreme general that got style
And watch how I rock and lock the block down
Tightly to fight me will cause disaster
No chance to surpass the vocab I master
As the sun rotate, took my guns off safe
Been a thug since 8, always drug my weight
I state the facts, mothafuck a platinum plaque
Always got my stack jackin off from havin a sack
Niggas act as if they back is stiff and can't put work in
Shake the turf then get to tuckin they shirts in
But I'ma stay bangin
The game that I'm claimin
Gold chain swangin
While the six trey hangin
Back bumpa
Impact the dumpa in the stash spot mash out
Knock it locked up with the ass drop

Hide the stash and cash, when my dogs hit town

Man let the summer begin
The heat excites the east siders
Ain't nothin' but G's and low riders
Dippin' in the tightest, indoed out, benzoed out
Fool we got the Henn no doubt
My friends show out, we stack up ends and roll out
Make sure the chronic smoke blows out
Them tricks got no clout, cause they hatin' how we serve it
Don't test T-Loc it ain't worth it, I serve it

I'm tired of these bitch made niggaz
Actin like they comin' through with hammers and triggers
I'll pull your whole card, nigga you ain't hard
Your homey's a bitch on the left with dick on his breath
I make fo's hop, what the fuck do you do
I done smacked around bitch niggaz just like you
A gangsta's a gangsta and that's all I'll be
What you want to do homey, chest blew through homey

You fuckin with some outlaws
Packin' on pistolas
Eses load up, with them East side soldiers
Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Hide the stash and cash, when my dogs hit town

Get high, fuck everything I'm blastin' on site
Throwin' up the hood for life
Movin in loco-motion, heated cause it's on
These niggas done came through and invaded the zone

Now ain't no mercy when we dealin' with these putos
Ask the homey Kurupt, he said the feelin' is mutual
We lay em down on site, on GP
Hit em up for la raza and for DPG

I got a cannon for the bustas, fuck the world
Gangstas and cascades, perms and curls
The M-16's bitches, 16 switches
Impalas, drops and pop collars

And ain't nuttin' changed, still standin' by the bar
Drunk as a motherfucker, shinin' like a star
And if you took a glance let me tell you what you saw
A god damn fool, yes yes y'all

I'm headless nigga, but I packs a big piece
Blastin, they let assassins loose on the street
Murderous notes I wrote, I lacerate throats
I toss fire at niggaz; motherfuck the six

The condos is supposed to be flip bricks
All thirty-nine of your bitches, pretty-ass bitch nigga 
I'll throw some fucked up kicks on
Next is a small tank top, the spot, shot it up

Beat you in your face wit a rope knotted up
'Cause we don't give a fuck, the Headless Horseman Kurupt
See I'm off the wall nigga, Horsementality
I'm a Horseman nigga and that's all I'll be

See I'm tired of the sparkly shit, niggaz talkin shit
I want to see the streets dark again
Let the heaters spark again, police callin all cars often
Powerful as a motherfuckin Vulcan

My specialty is - poetically lyrically energetically 
Ultra magnetically Dogg Pound pedigree
Fuck the shiny shit, fuck a bitch, only grimy shit
Dirty shit, holocaust in thirty-thirty shit

Missile flick assassin Sicilian
Kill women and kill men, and kidnap children
For vengeance in the name of the Horsemen
Slice your Achilles tendon, the Headless Horseman

And we abide by, the code of the streets
The makings of a real MC (C...C...C...C) yeah bitch!

[Killah Priest]
What the fuck y'all done started; four apocalyptic prophets
Appearin out of floatin' objects, wearin' Middle Eastern garments
Long trench coats with our hands in our pockets
Slappin' all you scary-ass rap artists, half-retarded

Swear by our forefathers
Anything you speak, think, or show will be disregarded
Then I drag your frightened ass through the darkness
Bring you out the other side, as a carcas

I'm heartless, regardless if y'all claim to be Gods or Goddess
To me, y'all all garbage; I see all of y'all as movin targets
And my lyrics be the atomic rockets, cosmic vomic - spittin'
Hittin' at y'all Vietnam vets

Wit military arms and bombs strapped to our chest
Castin' meteor storms and comets
Now who want to make the next ras comment
And be the first one left unconscious?

After I squeeze your head like the Charmin
Fuck around and see a lightning bolt around your throat
And squeeze till your head smoke from all the electric volts
Satanically sacrifice your ass like an occult

Have your seance inside of a dark synagogue
We was lyrically sent to y'all
Like the Men of God to put a end to y'all
I sniff bites like dogs to get the scent of y'all

Horsemen, we be scorchin when we be walkin'
With the power to put a graveyard inside a coffin

Let's air it out like the breeze
Now watch me do one-armed handstands 
And hang these N-you-T's over seven continents and seven seas
Streets is Lebanese

Be rockin Bulgari wrist watches and sniper marines
Most of these MC's can't even rap, just model and go gold
And get big-headed like they swallowin colleges
I spit empty gravesites, rap stars fill 'em up

You what? Thirty, forty years old and still wack as fuck
Me? I ain't even in my prime
When I write my dopest rhyme, Western civilization declines
Catch me hoppin off the A train in a New York state of mind

But I rep Westside, so I keep L.A. time
That's a three-hour difference;
So when my bitch is a six, she's really a nine
In seven days, she'd still be a dime

Call me Blaze Skywalker hittin jugular veins
Crack open your skull wit a paper weight and suck out your brains
Kiddo, I be doin my thug-thizzo for shizzo
And the wife of a careless man is almost a widow

So what's happening, from P.I. to '99 Madden
Since police be jackin blacks, I talk to pigs in Pig Latin:
Uck-fay ou-yay itch-bay at-lay a-igga-nay-play, 
And free Keith Mur-ray (Horsemen)

Yo, yo, yo

Make lightnin flash across the sky everytime I curse
Six-hundred and sixty-six flashes

Give out six-hundred and sixty-six lashes
To the backs of six-hundred and sixty-six Master of Ceremony has-beens
Put a crown of thorns on whoever the king of rap is
If he's a *Catholic* I nail him to a crucifix

Then I beat him till he's blackish-blueish
Then perform acupuncture wit six-hundred and sixty-six toothpicks
Beat em with two whips; with pieces of broken glass glued to it
Your whole crew get spayed and neutered

As soon as I aim and shoot it, you get sprayed with bullets
Your armored cars and your kevlar vest, is useless
I'm a fuck all of you pussies like group sex
You get six-hundred and sixty-six years imprisonment

For biting off another nigga's shit, you bitch
You got caught, now you on the other side of the law
Snitchin on mad niggaz in a soundproof court
To get some of your sentence knocked off (nah nigga) you wildin

But you still be in Riker's Island gettin forced to toss salads
You scared of that, wit a phobia fear of that
I'm a tape it on the digital video DAT
And send a copy to Miramax - leave you exposed

Turn all the fiction to fact, so everybody will know
You a sucker-ass nigga, father-fuckin ass nigga
That got fucked in the ass by your father figure
(No matter who?) I'll bruise and bash you, blast you

Autograph you wit a bullet wound for a tattoo
Deliverin mind blowin rhymes and poems 
Controllin my tongue when I'm flowin like pilot controlled Boeings
When I get bitten, I bite back, Quicker than Tyson attacks

I don't give a FUCK if I don't get my license back
So, take caution
The Four Horsemen'll chop your head off wit a sword then
Gallop Northward

You see, how I figure this thing 
We can, all take over this game 
If we, come together do this shit right 
We can, all have a piece of the pie 
You know, how i figured this out 
I just, took a little trip down South 
Soon as, I set foot off the plane 
It was, just like a family thing 
You know, a gangsta's hard to decieve 
So I, took a little trip to the East 
I'm not, slow so I can wait for the game 
I'm not, broke so I'm in bulletproof everything 
When I, touch down it ain't like a thing 
They ain't, trippin off nothin but things 
So I, quickly disposed of my shades 
If we, if we ain't got us nigga where would we aim 

This is where I want to be 
Right here with my loved ones 
Smokin' on some weed 
You got chronic why don't you light it up 

Yeah 
Show me somethin I ain't never seen

Ready to ride in the Lac again

Kurupt,"[Technique] 
By dawn's early light 
I shine brighter than the stars in the night 
And 'bout ready for a fight 
Come noon, I've consumed enough juice 
To cut loose and throw a mic to the moon 
Since I'm the sun, I'll make you one, it's all for fun 
I'm torching hot and all the same 
From playing war games with Saddam Hussein 
Now who's sane? I'm insane, my membrane's on cold-grown 
The tempature's rising, to fry the cells in your dome 
It might be on, and if you think so, you know me 
It's Tech Caponey, the Doggfather's little homey 
[Snoop Doggy Dogg] 
Ain't that somethin', how I got little homeys now? 
I remember when I was just a little bow-wow 
Writing for my rep, calling 'fore I step 
Now I put niggas in the game just to stay on deck 
High profile, but my style low-pro 
Top dogg on the Row, Doggystyle C.E.O. 
And I blow the best indo, that you know of 
So when I'm in your town, dip down, and show love 
You know what? What's up? Shit, I'm feeling good now 
You better come and get me 'fore I fall into a freestyle 
[Technique] 
They say, what's a rapper? Well nigga, what's an emcee? 
If they don't got the skills, then they don't roll with me 
Ain't that the truth?, I'm bulletproof off the roof 
I got a mic and a fix, that'll jack you for your tooth 
I'm out for rep, but how long will it last? 
I'm coming up quick, cause broke niggas need cash 
At last, I'm at the top, so I maintain now 
Gotta bang now, nigga this Doggystyle 
[Snoop Doggy Dogg] 
All she ever wanted was a small time, love thang 
Got my homey caught up in the dope game, coke game 
He so sprung, on top of that he young 
He's only thirteen years old, and the world's so cold 
He never took the time-out to fall down on his knees 
Until he fucked his G, got some keys, now they's enemies 
The niggas he grew up with, they put him in the game 
Now they 'bout to take him out the game 
Man it's a shame, but you know how that shit go 
That's life in the fast lane, that's why I roll ?? 
[Chorus]: Kurupt,(Snoop),  
I'd rather not get shot 
I'd rather sit in the studio and rock spots 
Dogg Pound, Doggystyle, we're one big family, it's all DPG (DPG) 
I got a G on the best bomb money can buy 
I ain't out for no homicides, I'm out to survive

(Niggas) Niggas and hoes will try to get you twisted 
But I'm unlisted in the books 
You base your life on that, you might get your life took, BLAOW! 
Put me in the game, I'm riding hard 'til I win 
Serve a crew, kill a few niggas, 'til the end 
I mean, I'm a fiend for superior green 
And all my life I got advice from a superior team 
I gotta stay away from the casket 
Don't get blasted, and tell my kids how I lasted 
But my crew's mafioso, so my philoso-

I'm loose, shook the feds, like the juice, Snoop Dogg is 121st proof 
Fool, you's a deuce, Deuce is some Genuine Draft 
I'm a genuwine, like ??, and all about cash, cash, 
Cash, I got some free, so indeed I gets the lighter for the hash 
Has it ever been a time when you didn't have a dime 
To your name, and the only way to gain is through crime?

Positioned at your dome, one twitch and it's on
No remorse or second thoughts once the clip and the chrome
This is the zone, weak niggas covers get blown
Stoned killers and gorillas want whatever you want
Shake spots with bank nots, keep the thang cocked
And leave motherfuckers stripped to tank tops
We the gang, it's our thang to mash and maintain

All out till we fall out, fuck the world

Show em what that Eastside LBC DPG like

Do you remember Wallabies and Crocusacks
Relicts gun pellets and blue golf hats
Racing tracks freaks with bats
Its been a tight rap and the say he got capped
Your city of your  corner was the center of the map
Back then we scrapped
The G's know the happs
I was only fourteen playing quarterback
Five years before I bought my first Crodusack
It just bat around a homeboys spot
Damn cuz the spot getting hot
One more fresh vest in our hood
I stole a Turkish rope with the homie no good
Squabbled with some Eses
He got what I got too
Be the nigga I was feeling suit

Bust a nigga's ass off just for saying a little something

At the age of seventeen not giving a shit

Don't smile in my face, when you see me get the fuck on
Dope fiend ass nigga, tryna to get a free check
Talkin' that shit, but you's a motherfuckin' bitch

I'll flip you, you must be smokin' dip fool
Nothin' but a bitch fool

'cause you know what motherfuckers like you do wit' nigga's on the set
Finish fuckin' face and leave ya clean cut shirt wet, and jet
'cause I'll smack the shit outta ya bitch ass you wanna run to the one's
Tell 'em about the cash and the stash, and were I got my guns

And you know I'm the bird man 'cause I sold so much coco
Beware of the crack pipe, that's by far in ya life
I got heroin by the balloons, kabooms and mushrooms
And my 38. specialist puttin' banker's in they tomb's
I'm one, shot, killed, and these bullets all go
And you takin' finger print's, and mugshots photo's
I use to beat bitch nigga's till they face turned blue

A car full of gas and nowhere to go
I gets a call on the phone ""what's happenin'?""
Pimpin', chillin' with bitches drinking silver satin
Is them bitches on deck, on deck to the fullest
Gots that type of game and I'm know just to pull 'em
Now as I stroll and as I pass by
Maxin' with my doggs feelin' dandy and high
Is that looney motherfucker that they call kurupt
Ballin' out the house with some gin in his cup

Now I found myself blowin' out smoke 
Bombed out looney and locced
Open up them doors let me see some of the hoes

I met this lil' sexie dame y'all before I knew

It ain't no need to lie
A lil' nigga like me got played, and if she left me
I thought I'd die

Thought she was sent from the heavens above

It's going down, West Coast
A toast to the Coast, West Coast!
I got my nigga Mack 10 up in the house from the Westside Connection
My nigga Deadly Threat from the L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, D.P.G, West Coast finest
Here's a toast to the coast!

What have we? - a house full of Cavi, no stress
Well known riders from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes licking up, so hard we're sticking up
How could the East Coast win; when the West Coast is clicking up?
So please, no set tripping about Cs and Bs
It's the Westside connected with the D.P.G.s
For the cheese we're jab with the gift of the gab always capping
Mack 10 and Snoop rapping, now how does that happen?
It's all good, fool, so peep game if you could
Snoop be from Long Beach, and I be from Inglewood
So now you despise, cause it came to your surprise
Two well known enemies now becoming allies
In Californ-I-A; we parley the G way
Some wear red and black, and some sport (Blue and Grey!)
But gangsters don't dance, we hang-boogie and bang
So it's the Westside connected with the Dogg Pound Gang

We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
Party people, party people, do you wanna get funky?
Get down, get down, you know

Up jump the boogie, so I've jumped up with it
We smoke weed by the ounce, no hit it
It's a party, Bombay and Bacardi, O.E. and Hennessy
We're all heated just in case, any of my enemies slipped in
Tripped in, you don't wanna own a casket this soon
Get at the bitches, nigga, bump to the boom
The ladies love me cause I love myself
I'm like an age, by no wine in time you'll find
I'm at the top of the shelf
So when you ready and you're cracking a sip
Strip, trip, slide around your house in your slippers
Bump the rap tunes that's as cold as the Whispers
Fantastic, brand new in this classic
We done mellowed out but you still get your ass kicked
It's Mr. Bad Azz, I rock microphones right
West Coast, East Side, for life!

It ain't no need for the fronting black, between me and you
Reality bites, so I'ma keep it real with my crew
I'm dangerous like Michael Dew
My life cycle completes the last stages
I'm more, I'm through, definitely gauges is outrageous
Cause I was born to rock the party
Oh! now you're Mister Smarty because we got the show started!
I'm cold-hearted, and won't stop what I'm revealing
Leave it up to the West to have them dancing on the ceiling
And I'm feeling, that Vibe that represents the East
I attack like a pack, to make them burn like grease
So let the nonsense cease, and hold my piece in case
Reel-to-reel come to deal, I have to give them a taste
I serve face to face, rhymes define by Tech
Versatile style done switched up to wreck your whole set

That's real, you know
It's getting kind funky here man, uh

Mack 10 is the lick, Dogg Pound is the clique
I can't get enough of this gangster shit
My name ain't +Jeru+ and I ain't out to +Dama-ja+
But when on the mic, emcees, to me, they're all amateurs
See the opponents, disassemble the components
Disassemble the opponents, then disappear in a moment
In a blink's time, I take time in the doorway to crime
With a criminal mind, the raw kind
Microphones used so abusively
You can't fuck with the K-U-R-U-P-T
And in the mixture, painted clearer than a picture of a psycho
I'm suicidal, split shit to cause a twister
And get you twisted, you're fucking with the unlisted
To be specific, niggas ain't being realistic
I ain't impressed, you're about to get your chest test
In the west, where it's about your money and your set

You East Coast niggas flow like the home grown grow
Zoo got the flavor, every color for the rainbow
Dream, on out far, pass the stars
Your styles ain't doper than ours
Hard to the core, hit it one time, hit it some more
Y'all spit but that West Coast shit is out doors
Wild like Ninety Days in the cage
Cold like the Everglades, and never fades
Me, C to the Z to the T

[Featuring Nate Dogg  Snoop Doggy Dogg] 
Snoop (Daz): 
Yeah  what I'ma do right here is take my time  
and dedicating this one to my niggas resting in peace  
and my niggas behind the wall. 
See you when I get there  you know what I'm saying? (really doe) 
So drip with me as I go down memory lane. 
Boy it's a loony where the grass is greener  
(1 8 7 ain't shit but a misdemeanor). 
I've seen a lot of niggas come up, but few niggas done up, 
some rest in peace, with their khakis heavy squeezed. 
But it's a East Side thang, a hoo ride thang, 
('cause if we bang to the boogie than we boogie to the bang). 
I bring you the motherfucking .38, 
(just get the MC and the homie Nate). 
So we can slide, slide, slipperdy slide, 
as I take you on a trip nigga ride (East Side). 
Nate (Daz): 
Do you remember back on the East Side? 
Where all us niggas used to love to ride. 
We didn't care what we did, 
time was nothing to us we were just kids. 
Times are different now, but you still get stuck, 
I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck. 
So if you're thinking about coming and stepping to me, 
keep this in mind: I'm a motherfucking O.G. 
Snoop: 
Lets speed the clock up and pass some time, 
June 17th, 1979. 
That's my first time being arrested, 
I know I did the crime, but I ain't going to confess to this shit. 
I learned than from the G's, 
a G is an overseer, the overseer sees. 
More than you do 'cause he gets experienced, 
and besides I'm just a juvenile delinquent. 
So I was gone, and I'm on my way home, 
my momma's going to get me, and I flee with (???). 
She puts a jacket on my back and hands me a comb, 
We stop and frosty freeze for a couple snowcones. 
She telling me that I didn't need to do what I done, 
she said: ""playing football should be your only fun son"". 
I'm like ""allright"" so we enter the house, 
come up to the door and pops fired to the mouth. 
I couldn't do nothing but cry like a bitch, 
I looked at my momma and said: ""damn, why you snitch?"" 
They put me on punishment but that didn't work, 
now wearing khakis, wallabees, and a T-shirt. 
And throwing up the neighborhood gang sides, 
I do my first robbery and now I gotta do time. 
Nate: 
My homie told me one day he had a jack move, 
he said: ""come on Nate Dogg, it'll be smooth"". 
I agreed and said ""come on, let's go and jack them fools"", 
next day we were draped in the county blues. 
I went and did a little time in the bucket see (seventeen years), 
saying to myself ""I'll never fuck with that nigga again"". 
'fore I'm locked down I learned to be 
what I am now and that's a motherfucking O.G. 
Original gangsta 
Daz: 
I grew up in the city as a chap, faced the trials, 
never smiled, became a gangster in the meanwhile. 
You'd find me swearing and lying, trying to be an O.G., 
beating the shit out of niggas for guess, some Hillfigers. 
The man behind the trigger, committing robberies, 
with the homies, no one could stop, nobody knew me. 
Breaking niggas for showing, sucker niggas better know me, 
because we ain't letting the bullshit slide no more. 
Do your wear nigga and kick in your front door, 
to let you know we can't take no more. 
Feeling revenge, killing enemies, family and friends, 
and let you pay the cost for my homie's life, it's lost. 
Toss a coin in the air, run my fingers through my hair, 
and ask myself: ""who the fuck should I really fear?"". 
I ran around with the best killers, 
thug criminals and drug dealers. 
Blasting niggas if they come near us, 
(???) with evil spirits, no one could help us if we could. 
Knock on wood for good luck, 
serve every nigga in your hood with a buck, now you've been struck. 
Stood gangsta in a static gangsta mack, 
a grown child laying niggas the fuck down. 
Nate (Daz): 
Original gangsta (original gangsta), 
coming from Long Beach (the town by the sea where niggas know me). 
Coming from the East Side... 
You're fucking with The Pound, oh nigga please, 
see-O-B.'s can't see the D-O-double G's, [O.G.'s... repeat 5 times] 
shout outs to my nigga Mr. D-A-Z, 
shout outs to my nigga Mr. Warren G, 
shout outs to my nigga S-N-double O-P, 
shout outs to my niggas see, Style and me. 
Snoop (Nate): 
Yeah, straight up, based on a true story. 
you know what I'm saying? It's a G thang baby (original gangsta) 
You trick ass bitch!

Unlike any other record label, we plan to get green
And keep it clean and stay oh, so mean
So rough, so tough

What is it? This for them, suckas
Nigga, I came from a long line of playas
That ain't scared of nar' one of y'all, motherfuckers
I see these niggas wanna see me catch a case and get struck out
But I'm laughin' 'bout to knock they ass the fuck out

Bitch, quit actin' like a stuck up clown
That's why yo raggety ass attitude is fucked up now
Suga Free, bitch swingin' on my dick sayin', wee

That's why I play the role, keep control
And throw them off wit' these dirty gators
See time was torn

'cause if I bought me somethin' to eat, shit
I bought you somethin' too, what's mine is yours
But now you'd rather bring me down and see me fall
Walkin' wit my head down, straight, dependin' on y'all

The call me Honcho, I like to sparkle
I'm 'bout to barbecue a bitch like the charcoal
Am I a star? No, ya' in my car? No
My name is Soopafly, bitch so ya' all know

Now heffer don't act stupid, 'cause ya'know who I am
The nigga quick to talk shit and don't give a damn
I tell that hoe run, man that hoe better scram
I pimp across the land, better read ya' motherfuckin' press telegram

Snoop Dogg told me that
Now blow me back while I'm pimpin' on this funky track
Bang ES, we givin' it up, got the bitches singin' the rest
We blastin' motherfuckers, run up and come test

Better, hide yo chest and fasten yo vest
No bullshit, take yo bitches so quick and so fast
(So fast)
Fuck wit' us, I'll put a foot up yo ass

Collect calls from the pen so I catch it in the kitchen
The homie say, send him naked pictures of bitches
And if they talkin' backwards, he'll have a homie's jack up
That nigga fucked Pat up, fuck havin' a homies tack up

We slap hoes that step on toes of our dada's
And ask them niggas in the Source Awards
When I caught them while y'all was pacin', the homies
Was bringin' up situations, eliminating fake niggas while I'm paper chasin'

Okay, let the homies spray the K
Dippin', hittin' switches bouncin' over ditches
Callicodes, collapse niggas, perhaps niggas
Trap or dap and clap niggas, I'm young gottstra

Put it up, pistols might sizzle a nigga
For shizzle my nigga Kurizzle was nizzle my nigga
Like a bitch or a busta, bust a, four fizzle
Surface the air miss wit a homie, wait for the whistle

Who you thought we was? Temperatures might rise
Before everybody feel the fire from the five's
I told Daz we about to fry niggas like fries
And separate them by five's and light up the skies

Crip that D P, Kurupt
Dippin' and I'm out, put a dick in yo mouth
Dogghouse gangstas

Dippin' and I'm out, put a dick in yo mouth, ya bitch

Bitch nigga jaw jackin', get blasted out the frame
Let them punk, punk you up
You jumped up and got stomped the fuck down, what now?

Showdown, got your three ring circus Bozo's
Cannot work or see the tears of a clown
Listen nit wit, you can't get wit
Try to sit, wit, and get yo shit split quick

Stayed on my toes like the nigga pimpin', watching the corner
Much love to my niggas rippin' in California

Goldie got a couple of hoes hoppin' out the Rolls, we chillin'

I came in bangin' dub, minutes

All my niggas know, I ain't no motherfucking gimp
I get down damn, runnin' from damn town
Dogghouse nigga, Dogg Pound, bound

How you motherfuckers like me now when I do it like?
Bust on the microphone, 'cuss on the microphone
Yeah this nigga like Tracy, Tray Dee
Bang his ass, slap his ass in the striz neet

Catch him wit the headlock, pistol whippin' wit the glock
Lil' Goldie Loc about to set up shop
These motherfuckers don't like me anyway
Shit, I ain't got nothing to say, wit no time to play

What these motherfuckers thought I was about?
When I bust this bitch I put my dick in her mouth
Now all them niggas got something to say
But I'ma tell 'em Lil' Goldie don't play, nigga

Yeah, it's the genius of the click
Known to sleep a nigga quick
So watch how ya' gums bump speakin' on the wrist
I drew the diagram how to mash the game
Never hesitated when it came to blasting thangs

From the knuckle shoes buckle when we lock and strap
I'm a real rider nigga you can drop the act
I got stripes and bars from a life at war
Twice as hard, as niggas claim they sheisty y'all

Criminal, lay 'em down for their stacks and sacks
For the mic, used to trife with the mass and gats
Do or die to survive from my time of birth
Then I'm out for gettin' mine till I ride the hearse

It's going down, Dogghouse gangsta style
And fuck death row, we'll take 'em out
We got the whole rap game bangin' now
What you motherfuckers think this game's about?

You been a waitin' and a waitin' as I can see
So treat me like the pope and bow to your knees
Oh the genius on the mic is back again
So get on the phone and go tell a friend

In case anybody ain't reach the top, that's cause they ain't deserve to
Now shut the fuck up before I get my guns out
And I ain't playing no games
So check a nigga I ain't sayin no names

How move it, who I move, but that's what they want
But they just can't see me, I slide up on 'em

Work that bitch from a corner into a comba, nigga ya want to?

Fleetwoods and Lax on the homies straps
Nigga I rise for the hood home boy
What up Dogg, it all ain't good home boy

We holding up your motherfucking candy store
And don't nobody get up til we hit the door
I said lay down and don't get up!

I just got paid, it's Friday night
The party's jumping, I feel so high
Dogg Pound Gangstaz, we at it again
Party's popping, from beginning to end

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Gimme what cha got, move something for me
Show me what ya got, shoot something for me
Who got the Henn? Who got the bud?
Stash, slash, hazel hash
Hit me with the world dog
Keep them cuffs on your girl dog
I'm a major majority, of this party
Gangsta party, Kurupt Young Gotti
'cause ain't nothing else to do
And when Friday hit, my day hit
See, it's all left up to you
It's your choice when Kurupt step up to you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Ain't nothing else for me to do besides dip
Going through it homie like it just ain't shhh
Now that I'm here, where you, at
Front to up, down, to back to front round the back
Okay let's say, you can do it your way
I'ma do it my way
Project to borough, today to tomorrow
Escapade to parade, expressway to highway
The freeway to tristate, 101045
Turn to 95, this side ride
Saturday's always the best of me
'cause the whole day ain't nothing but rest to me
I got ladies hitting me cause they just want to chill
Perfect requirements in a safe environment
Like what's that popping at the top of the hill
Where it's always popping like hits and villes

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Sunday nights and it ain't no fights
The homie just added up at the Dogg House
Where everything was great it was 2008
Like a dream with a bottle and everything's fine
And Nate he started blowing on the mic
And Butch he started blowing on the mic
And G he started blowing on the mic
Dogg Pound Gangsters all day and all night

Kurupt,"The reason that I'm here, I'ma drop 'til it's clear
Let all, G'z to front, middle and rear

Just to sit and sippin' and dippin' all over the ways

That they ears and chairs, dis on this years
Cokes drippin' off juice and gins
As a matter of fact, takes mathical fact
And you can't de-grate, y'all get played like a sax

Trumpet to trombone
Too shotty Young Gotti, millennium bone
If she raggedly, I'm sendin' 'em home
Puttin' 10 in the chrome, lettin' all killin' it's on

It don't quit, it don't stop
Let the beat knock, beat knock
Pull up at the spot, pull up at the spot, in a drop top
Gettin' what I got, I just

Can't go wrong, releasin' all my lost hood songs
Don't give a damn on the real, I say just what I feel
No matter whatchu say, I'll never stop my bust style way
No time fo' da game, I do it my way

I'ma drop 'til it's clear
And these re-beams and pumps is Vietnam time
Tossin' see-notes, the, 'Magnificent Magneto'
Dippin' through, comin' like ay

Don't expect nothin' less, these gleam on the tray
All night and all day, it's the best in a 2001 S S
It's the prince of the West, I ain't tryna do much
Tryna do too much, I ain't even really trippin'

It's just me, Snoopy and Quik and someone like you
Wit' the biggest mouth to put a dick in
Most of y'all malfunction like faulty equipment
Shifted, drifted, different, up lifted

Kurupt Young Gotti, just call me fall beaty
With the skirts from Tahiti workin' at the mall
With young Roscoe, you fool in high school
I just tuck my Roscoe, dump fossils, colossal, I

Yes, 1, 2, fuck wit' my crew
And we won't stop poppin' 'til ya body turn blue
3, 4, look at that whore with the fat ass
But without the cash, hit the door

The reason that I'm here, Kurupt done bought the beer
I'ma lush, lookin' fo' the cush, lookin'
Fo' the bush to push and mush back
I'll hump the ho if she ain't been needin' a Dusch bag

No, must've been the Gucci, wit' hair that's pushed back
In a bun lookin' fun gettin' silly, wit' my celly from Billy
Brought to you by way or two buns
We smugglin' in and out of the place, our two guns

Notice, see the Q you I, Dogg Pound collabo', yup
We stab hoes in the bladder actin' bad wit' the mad hoes
Get out, yeah, look here, we started this pussy shit, no shit
And these the mothafuckin' hoes we get, c'mon

Tryin to see and pour 6 feet of gravel on top of me
And all my playaz go to wakes so the next nigga can take my place
And try to invade my space
Make enemies search for God like Ma$e (Yeah)
You should avoid catchin 2 to the face, so I can avoid catchin a case
You'se just another mutha fuckin rat in a race
I explode and expose to this multi-platinum fan base

Crushed your flow you got jealous club me for
I sensed the hate, I used my optical
You was too close around when I pocket doe
First came the wishin', then came the bitchin'
Wanna know the secrets comin' from the kitchen

How he grew, up and, what he grew up to
And what he gon' grow up to be

Temptation to touch, a terrible thing
A placement in your palm an unbearable thing

Wrapped like pearls and shells make 'em wriggle like worms
We everlastin', Kurupt and Everlast
Lashin', ever ready sounds, spreadin' like rashes

Life is complicated, Kurupt, Everlast and Soopafly made it
For traded, supposedly stay shaded

I heard that true
Make things go up an' down
I heard that's true

I been through the full court pressure stage
The homies gave me a nine, the first time I saw a gauge
The first time I put my feet
Down solid mashin' on top of concrete

Before all the ways of war
House an' car doors felt the rays of war
When life was simple as shit
An' we didn't give a fuck about a bitch, 1986

It's all about lics, heat in the streets
Trucks with the beats
Bitches with biker shorts, worn all tight
Tryin' to get a pussy, just worn all night

Plus you had to be a baller to get the baddest hoes
Back in the days, 6-4 six trays
Back in the days, Elco's, S S's
The best is where the west is niggaz don't test us

Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?

Back in the days where them laces were thick
I was concerned with break dancin' an' layin' some dick
For whatever it's worth, I'm still doin' the smurf
An' I'm walkin' on this earth like I don't give a fuck

An' now I'm rollin' up in third gear
With 3 dollar bills, 3 more minutes to kill
3 more seconds to snap, 3 more bottles of beer
An' corrupt my lifestyle, so shut the fuck up
An' back the fuck up with that buck free style

Nigga, what freestyle, nigga?
Walkin' on a razor blade
Comin' through I got it made, posted up in the shade
Comin' through to get paid, sunny California, baby

I got subs in my trunk an' it's bound to bump
Straight smashin', hollerin' out, ?Wassup, Kurupt??
Wassup? I'm fillin' in my right mind, one to the head
An' I'm on the smash, hollerin' out, ?Wassup, Fred??

Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?

I don't give a fuck, so fuck what they say
Nigga, won't you pass? Say, ?Pass the bombay?
Niggaz, they decide to ride an' they ride
Niggaz, they decide to lie an' they die

I can bust a fleet of hoes with my skills
I can make them hoes bow down, pay my bills
Think I can make them hoes convert to my will
Wanna bet I'll turn them hoes in the scrill'?

If you love a bitch, a bitch can drive you crazy
Anythin' a hooker do, it won't amaze me
You better be up on your game homie 'coz they be
They may talk a lot of shit but they can't fade me

If you hang around with suckaz then you may be

Pretty short cuts or, hair to the middle of ya back

And the summer dresses and the small feet, all petite
See that's what little bomb mamas is made of
But most of why'all suckas like cluckas that's made up

I got a house on the hill, where me and you could chill

Retired and rewired, melodically molecules

'91 ('91) Cypress Hill burst upon the scene
Three crazy, gun-totin' niggas smokin' weed
Talkin' about life on records was the whole plan
So we put out The Phuncky Feel, but you were feelin' Kill A Man (Kill A Man)
That was about the time we was openin' up for Naughty
Didn't know shit, we were jus' tryin' to rock the party

'92 ('92) a year later, 'bout a million records sold
From doin' shows like Lollapalooza on the road
Buildin' up momentum, whilst spittin' deadly venom
Takin' pictures for High Times, me, Muggs and Sen
Chillin' with the Beastie Boys, smokin' lots of weed
But it was time to hit the studio for another LP

'93 ('93) Black Sunday hits, with critical acclaim
Had a monster hit from Insane In The Brain
Topped the charts, held the spot, for six weeks to boot
It was a trip to note, that we was the first ones to do it in rap music
But it was a feat none the less
So we started gettin' paid and I stopped smokin' stress

[Chorus]

'94 ('94) still in the door and we conquered many tours
With Rage Against The Machine, House Of Pain and many more
Was even invited to Woodstock, some niggas from the block
Called up Eric Bobo and half a million rocked
How could all this happen at 24 years of age
Half a million bouncin' to your shit from off the stage

'95 ('95) I was alive and survived so far
Still tryin' to cope with bein' a rap star
'Cause that's the type of shit that can really affect your mental
This was evident, in the way I broke the tempo
With confusin'(I'm havin' Illusions) pain, and hence illusions
But I still kept my set up with the critics bein' abusive (Yeah)
Even the record company, they became illusive
When it comes to showin' support for the Cypress institution

'96 ('96) wit' no support we were still makin' moves
Cypress Hill, in the summer, we were on the Smokin' Grooves
But like every legend every click, someone had to split
So the Dog left the house, shit was gettin' kinda thick
I was with the electric lady, we was talkin' about babies
But the groupies on the road don't help me from misbehavin'

[Chorus]

[B-Real]
'97 ('97) was the trip, it was the year we killed the feud
Between us and Cube, over shit nobody knew
The Dog came back home but after Smokin' Grooves 2
Chillin' with George Clinton and Erykah Badu
This was a crazy time, we were flowin' off the boo
Niggas on stage, trippin' on the 'shrooms

'98 ('98) was kinda great, 'cause it felt just like before
We hit the studio, recorded Cypress Hill IV
But someone dropped the ball, as I still recall
'Cause it felt Cypress Hill got no support at all
We did the last Smokin' Grooves, but did it all with Sen
And the old chemistry, just reared it's head again

'99 ('99) I got to recline, because there was no doubt
That the first year was a success, of the Smoke Out
'99 was even better than the year of '98
And Skull And Bones was comin' out, kickin' from the gate

Two-thousand (Two-thousand) 15 million records sold
They broke the mould, but there's others along the road
But we still keep rollin' on from Heaven to Atlantis
Droppin' shit in English and makin' albums in Spanish

Two-thousand and one (Two-thousand and one) 
Goddamn, who knows what's in store
Just as long as motherfuckers know, who's knockin' on the door
We remain unjaded and still we go unfaded
See how long we made it and never ben outdated

Cause we niggaz so ignorant, ignorant
We bang bang cause we ignorant
Motherfuckers can't figure it, figure it

[Kokane]
I'm the epitome of this rap game
The most controversial name, they call me Kokane
I'm so ignorant, black ladies be hidin they purse with white ladies
Fifty niggaz in a Navigator, and a Range Rover
Blowin bomb sticky doja
Lookin at these studio gangsters gettin over
It's Yuk and Kokane and Nate Dogg, we stay true
Snatch yo wack ass off stage - we all gonna laugh at you
Ah, I wear the same khakis for about four days
And I, I don't brush my teeth, cause I got tooth decay
I keep the door open when I shit
And if I'm fucked up sometimes, I forget to flush it EWWW
Fuck respectin my elders, they ain't gon' get it soft
Cut in front of a 80 year old lady, and flip her ass off
I taught my 13 year old son how to slang
PCR, Dogghouse when I bang, and I'm out, nigga

[Chorus]

[Yukmouth]
What? Nigga, ery'thang, ery'thang..
Motherfuckers get sprayed fuckin wit Yuk, Kokane and Nate
Since back in the day, been slangin crack nay, packin a gauge
Diamond taps on our braids, pack a case, stack it away
Y'all niggaz perform overseas then back to the states
When subtractions are made, thug money the blueprint
+Regime Killers+, my click too sick, we rule shit
And to spit at a few clicks, rob motherfuckers who move bricks
Pop motherfuckers wit loose lips
Bitches who snitch out's finna get hit, get put in a ditch
Yukmouth runnin, livin this shit
""Ice Cream Man,"" I invented this shit
Ain't no gimmicks to this, my shit is rugged and hardcore
Give Killa Cali niggaz what they starve for
Bring y'all war like, ""What's the issue?""
I shoot up everybody, even an ugly fat bitch too
If I get you (?) (?) another shit on you ridiculous
Give that nigga some tissue, let that bitch know, I'm ig'nant

[Chorus]

[Kurupt]
Are you real motherfuckers, for real motherfucker?
Well I ain't real, I'm ultramagnetic bitch
I'm somethin you don't wanna fuck wit
I'm the nigga wit the pistol, launchin six from the clip
I'ma eclipse the moon like pitch black nigga
Nate, Yuk, Kokane, Kurupt we back nigga
Yak in a 'llac nigga, Young ready to collapse lungs
Two shots make slums collapse niggaz
See me face to face, talk that shit
Pretend you on the +moon+ Michael +walk+ that shit
What up pretty mama, a.k. pretty bitch
This Kurupt, I know you fucks to get rich
I met many bitches, in my day
Got the homies on the left side, holdin the 'K
Kurupt, the analytical, phenonomal, the most anticipated
Highly hated, top graded
Ig'nant than a motherfucker, I don't give a fuck

Got the big joints
Ducking the tens
Parked in the bricks
Hopped the fence
Barked at a bitch
My daily routine
Steaming the mots
Scheming for knots
Cop checking on my blue jeans
Quested in my cool genes
Hot like Southern California
I'm trying to push the Benz drop top
Jump off
Watch when summer's round the corner
Sneakers and boots
Jeans for the troops

I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangsta type, what I recites kinda lethal
Niggas know, the flow that I kick, there's no equal
I'm murdering niggas, yo, and maybe because of the tone
I kicks when I grip the mic and kick shit
Niggas can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore, and slam
'Nough respect like a sensei, ba-bash like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossing
What don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson
Take a walk through the hood when we up to no good
Slanging them things like a real O.G. should,
I'm stacking and macking and packing a ten so
When you're slipping, I slip the clip in
But ain't no set tripping
'Cause it's Death Row, rolling like the mafia
Think about whooping some ass, but what the fuck stopping ya
Ain't nothing but a buster
I'm Stranded on Death Row for pumping slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know you're outdone
Feel the shotgun, Kurupt, inmate, cell block one

No prevention from this mention of sorts
You're a victim, from my driveby of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braile
From the lunatic, I death like arsenic
When I kick up wicked raps
Dr. Dre will kick the scratch
With treachery, my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, plural, make it, many storms
When I'm vexed, I fly leg necks and arms
In this dimension, I'm the presenter
And the inventor, and the tormentor
Deranged, like the hillside strangler
MC mangler, tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite
So what you wanna do
The narrator RBX, cell block two

Rage, lyrical murderer
Stranded on Death Row
And now I'm serving a lifetime sentence
There'll be no repentance
Since it's the life that I choose to lead
I plead guilty
On all counts let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress
Bed frame there's another dead pain
Laying lain with the shame, who's to blame
Me, the lady of Rage
On when I'm coming from the D-E-A-T-H in
R-O-W taking, no shit
So flip and you're bound to get dropped
It's 187 on motherfuckers don't stop
Handcuffed as I bust there'll be no debate
It's Rage, from cell block eight

Ayo stepping through the fog
And creeping through the smog
It's the number one nigga from the hood, Doggy Dogg
Making videos, now I stay in Hollywood
Busting raps for my snaps now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homey little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga
Shooting at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to death row cause I wanted to make a grip from serving my rocks
And I'm still, serving for mines, peace
To my motherfucking homies doing time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbing with your blues on, mad as hell
And you say yeah fuck the police
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's driving the cops crazy
But ain't nothing but a black thing bay-bee
No I'm not flagging, but I'm just sagging
I betcha don't wanna see the D-O double G
And you can't see, the D-R to the E
Or my motherfucking homey D.O.C.
You know you can't fuck with my motherfucking DJ
That's my homey and we call him Warren G
Yeah, and you don't stop

That's the only way we'll beat em man

I can't help but think we might even be closer
We use to be back to back holdin' toasters

[Chorus]
I didn't change
When why'all niggas wanted to stay, I didn't change
When things wasn't going our way, I didn't change
When why'all niggas wanted the verse
The shoe was on a different foot and the roles reversed, I didn't change
When niggas use to call us wack
Like ""Fuck the Westcoast"" and never call us back, I didn't change 
When niggas was talkin shit
Talkin' bout they ain't fuckin with us, I never changed, nigga

Give me mines, give me mines nigga
This is for the homies
""It was nineteen ninety three""
Blaze that shit up
This is for the homies

I'm about to change motherfucking rules
Here first like wild motherfucking bulls
I'ma make something for niggas to link about
And leave the whole hood with something to think about
I can't help but think a million times a day
A nigga got about a million things he gotta say
I never been the type to beat around the bush
My big homie introduced me to Benz's and cush
God grant me the strength to go the length, the width
With a little bit of that and a bit of this
It's fucked up that a nigga that I barely know
Would give it up to me but my homies won't
My success pattern is in a constant shake
It's like film making without no film to make
It's like hang gliding but I can't hang
And now niggas tryin' to kick me out my game
All because of where I choose to lay my hat
All because of where a motherfuckers at
I'm feelin' like I'm falling like dead leaves
It like I'm swingin' from vines like Tarzan
I'm about to take another trip to Tarzana
Pop something for a motherfucker to go bananas
Rack up the gauge, 'cause I can feel it coming
It's the heater home in the summer, I feel it coming
My kids my main priority, you authority, agility, ability
My tranquility to toss a typhoon at the moon
Hurricane spread through the saloon like alien goons and harpoons
I could do this shit by myself
I'd rather be read then be placed back on the shelf
I'ma motherfucking G, nigga, forever til I die DP, nigga
I love why'all cause",I Didn't Change,2004
Kurupt,"Yeah! (Where they at?)

I'd never have no motherfuckin' Hennessy to drink

Take 'em home, wash the steak sauce off my dishes

The only reason they do it - they think I got riches
I'm just speakin' the truth, I ain't tryin' to be malicious
My nigga King Tee told me not to trust 'em
These days I don't even like to discuss 'em

Knock on wood grain, the whole hood sayin'

Dippin' down the streets on them golden thangs
It's a gang bang retreat for the niggaz in the streets

I'm a take me a pint of Hennessy to the neck, I'm a wreck
'Cause I'm too bent and this bitch won't get off my dick
Bitch, you actin' like you never seen a nigga on some gangsta shit
Flip bitch, flip like bricks and chip

And get the fuck off a nigga dick
I hit Hawthorne and holla at young Slip
Unload clips, so lil' niggaz don't trip
Me and Slip never slippin', we all about bangin' and dippin'
Jackin' for D's and radio equipment

[J-Ro]
My rhymes slide through the air like cardinals and particles
Got niggaz callin' audibles
I'll change the game, remain the same
Train in the rain, spit nothin' but flame

Body blows that you can't sustain
Hit the switch, bend the frame
Throw your hands up if you in the game
Roll that shit up and take it to the brain
(Take it to the brain)

We all gon' bubble tonight

Cause we took they shit, now its time to floss

22 year old 17 war vet
Life in the fast-lane, little red corvette
Little red handkerchief, hangin' out the right side
Back pocket jeans fallin', cover my Evisu sign
Yep we do shine, and they gon' hate
But they hated Jesus baby we won't break
So we ride like four Pirelli's
So secured, no security, no protectin' no comparing
Loc' and heavy, Ocean eleven
Aviators, boat takers, so fackers
No playas, I'm Hollygrove to the heart
Hollygrove from the start
Don't cross Earhardt
Boulevard where the ward I come from
One seven, one shot, never that (blum blum)
Brrt Brrt! Pop Pop! Clap Clap!

Sit 'em in the river, leave 'em, they find em tomorrow evening, sinkin'

He don't know I got the nina wit' the full clip
That's a somersault back spin full flip for ya?
Push this button, I flip out and hit something
Miss nothin' I'm just bustin' until this scene clean
Twelve hundred for the jeans stop playin'
Hundred dollars for the glock in my pants
Who the man? I am when I stand with it pointed right at ya face
Knock the brains from the back of ya neck for lack of respect
I, strap a jet black gat till the deck
Tell the mama to bury me with that, no bullshitin'
My hood getting kinda crazy where I be
So Ronie's with me 'cause he's the O-G

We won, we won

Fresh out the back seat of the figgity phantom
The haters I make 'em madder when I wave at 'em like what up?
If it ain't about money I keep goin'
I try'na get that green, niggas try'na mow my lawn
But fuck, them boys I got the shottie on my arm
If them boys run up I leave their bodies on the lawn
And duck the fuck out a there, 'cause baby its hot out there
If this was a movie it's time to roll the credits, cut!
Its all over, all of ya brains is all over the motherfuckin' block!
I'm a motherfuckin' rock!
Hard body eagle street seventeen shots
Night vision double-clip, hot steady beam, glat! Pop!

This is not for little bitches you man or a fox

Kurupt,"You're back now at the jack-off hour this is DJ, Eazy Dick
On W-Balls, right now, something new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, 'cause we gonna make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
Cause I have never
Met a girl
That I love
In the whole wide world

Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's something I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch!

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do?  You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on back
So back up bitch 'cause I'm struggling, so get
Off your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth

Don't wanna fuck with me
Dogg Pound Gangstas
We do it like that
Motherfuckers out there be like, takin our styles
Be trying to do they own little dissing
But they can't do it, you know
So we gonna, do it like this
Sit back relax and get a cool one

Have you ever heard of a slaughter, I oughta start dippin
Sippin on that S-T get's me to trippin
I don't slips I bangs
With that mad ass Dogg Pound Gang it's a DPG thang
Kurupt from the S.C
You wanna test me let's see if you'll survive .45 times
Like a hollow point headed for your dome
Take a couple of steps, turn around and it's on
Couldn't withstand the murderous mental
I subdue, and then take two to your temple
When I cause holocoust from what's spittin

I grab my strap you best run nigga
I gives a fuck, Kurupt's the kingpin of the click
Littlest G, with the biggest dick

Shit, a motherfucker better recognize
With a twist of my wrist like O.J. you all die
I snack on motherfuckers like a bone
Known to be the shit upon the microphone ever since I was born
Not to ever love a bitch
Learned game after game, that's why we are the best
Motherfuckers be gankin styles minute after minute
But soon as you did it I smelled the niggas shitted


Now what would you do
If you could fuck with me and my crew
But you can't so don't even think about
Steppin in the motherfuckin house

Bitches butterfly all day, while I steady make my pay
Every single day in the LBC
Cruising through the Eastside, me and Lil' Style
When I back up a green six-fo' busting freestyles

There's no escape, give me the papes and the tape case
How much money can a nigga make in one place
The review, ain't shit new
You stupid motherfuckers can't fuck with my crew

I see all these niggas trying to get with my kin folk
Get so many busters on the West Coast
And then to say the least
I see a few trick ass niggas layin low on the East Coast
And the question is asked
Do you wanna rap, scrap or blast to that nigga Daz
I'll be the first one to him em
Oh yeah, fuck B.G. Knocc Out and every nigga down with him
Cause I'm a Natural Born Killer
In a Steeler hat motherfucker cuz it's like that

Now what would you do
If you could fuck with me and my crew
But you can't so don't even think about
Steppin in the motherfuckin house

There's so many motherfuckers that I can include
Whose quick to blast motherfuckers in a feud
It doesn't make a difference, cuz it's about
Who's the quickest on the draw to end all existence
For instance, let's take these Ruthless fools
These Ruthless fools and the Pound in one room
Assume, it's only for conversation, so let's
Conversate slip a nigga the .38 then dip
Empty out the clip
Mind on stead-trip, cuz niggas talk shit

Now if, a nigga had a prayer before a nigga died
Would the nigga be dead or would he stay alive
And if I was in your shoes, would I survive
Probably not, you'd probably let your Glock go pop
Now drop, to your knees
And picture Dat Nigga Daz flowing in the breeze

Now what would you do
If you could fuck with me and my crew
But you can't so don't even think about
Steppin in the motherfuckin house

From the twitch of the eyes
You can see the line, just know it when you see it
Cause it messes up the flow, to the real fillings y'know
And I'd rather be sipping on a glass of wine
Can you feel yourself in the room with Everlast
Trying to steal a flow, I don't think so
Cock-blockers come with their hearts beating jealousy
Then away like a stray dog
Tryin to claim every bitch as his own
Cock-blockers, come in every color
Even blue, now this is true
Trying to fuck your woman, and even you
Now what the fuck would you do, motherfucker",What Would U Do?,2005

And ran rap and back you can get that. 
But where's the channels? Nobody's openin' doors.

Fly far away, don't never look back. 
If they could do what you could do, 
They would love to do it. 
So that's why they got an opinion, 
But to me you see opinions is like a asshole,
Everybody got one. 
That don't mean I'm gonna stop doin' what I do cause you can't do it.

When I was young living life on the run,
Eleven years old real life no goals,
Sneaking little sips in the cut,
Before they even called me Kurupt, 
Ridin' down the block so Ima tell you how I grew up,
I was always in the mix, too young for sticks
Ty tell em about that Watts experience

In Watts, a nigga couldn't wait for the summer time
Back yard barbecue yea that'll free your mind, 
We stayed fallin' of them ice cream trucks,
All my niggas nickel baging it and hustling bucks,
You could catch me in the middle of the streets 
Slap boxing with my nigga Porky,
And as I take you down my memory lane 
I'm reminiscin bout my ghetto dayz
Let em know

Let me take you back ooh (I'm reminiscin' bout my ghetto dayz)

I ain't changed nigga, I'm just busy
Fuck bein' broke nigga, I'm filthy
Got a problem wit me holla at me I'll be back in 6 months
I'm on the road gettin' my money up
And I remember all the young soldiers in the hood
Tryin' to gang bang slingin' nickel bags
Screamin' money ain't a thing, for real
I know exactly how y'all feel
I'm reppin' black and brown pride
West Side til I die

I got a lot of rider in me
I was thinkin', couple years older
Fourteen smokin' and drinkin'
Thinkin' bout uncle Jame's army
The old folks love it
I'm just gettin' up in the game
And gang bang bubbly
Crinshaws crackin, durin' the day got schwinns
On Sunday's watchin' all the big homies spin
I won't dance
'Cause thats all I see
That's like the army
That's all you can be

I used to love feedin' polices and cheap coast
Watch me jump up in the push
And play hide and go get it I'm wit it
And all the hoodrats used to hold us down on the block
Reminiscin' bout my first piece of cock

Truth is I ran way when I was 5 years old
Ran til my And 1's had holes in the soles
I had 3 silk shirts, 2 pairs of jebose
Spent the night at boo's house, we was sharin' his clothes
Moms left me out in the cold
Worst that that my man took 5 shots and ain't lose his soul
I was livin with a blind man's vision
And no matter how hard I tried, I could never see prison
And to all my dead homies, we don't pour rout liquor
We just poke our chests out, and say we miss ya niggas
We was scared of gang bangers, walked to school in groups
Argued who was the best MC, Ice Cube or Snoop
Damn, I miss my ghetto dayz
Whether it was Coca Cola or straight coke
We found a way
Hey and the memories of EZ and Pac
California we all we got

I remember when I used to say I wanna rap and sing
All my niggas used to laugh at me
But now, I'm on top of my game
But now, it ain't a damn thing changed
Ghetto superstar to coca cola
All my people locked down, got nothin' but love for ya
Stay strong, 'cause I know it ain't easy
Come home, 'cause we miss ya on the streets

And I hops in my ride to make a quick run

I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tight than a motherfucker with the gangsta beats
And we was ballin' on the motherfuckin' Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number 1 song after number 1 song
Long as my motherfuckin' pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hangin' with a white bitch doin' the shit she do
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or 2
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suing cause the shit she be doin' ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she's takin' me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize and pass to Daz

Now as I'm rollin' with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fuckin' hoes, clockin' dough up to no good
We flip flop and serve hoes like flap jacks
(But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
Ya run up in them hoes and grab the cash
And get your dash on
While you're chillin', with your homies and shit
And how my niggaz kick the anthem like this, bitch!

To the store, to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes
So I head down the street to Long Beach
Just so I could meet, a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothin' but homies around so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes
But I'm from the pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a hoe? (Why?)
'Cause a hoe's a trick
I don't love them tricks (Why?)
'Cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
And turnin' them trick ass hoes the fuck out, now

I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Used to be up in them guts like everyday
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucker lickin' the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figure niggaz wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one time
I'm back to the motherfucking county jail
6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail
I get's released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr Dre
Scooped in a coupe, Snoop we got news
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfucking chin checking
Move up the block as we groove up the block
See my girl's house, Dre, pass the glock
Kick in the do', I look on the flo'
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my hoe, yo (Bitches ain't shit)
I uncocked my shit, I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed
Man, fuck a bitch!

(Bitches ain't shit) I don't give a fuck about a bitch
But I and her know that they can't fade this
'Cause I'm doing my own thing down with the swing
I'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thing
I say you know can't deal
'Cause I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfucker need to step back, hell yeah
They need to chill
Because I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck

I gotta do some shit that's clean
But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean
Like a washing machine
I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows
That I'm on the flow ho
But they can't hang with my type og swing
I ain't tryin' to say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones
With he tip of the tongue
And then their sprung
With the nuts hung

My habitat is black, ramsacked with heavy gats
Hit a nigga so hard that his head gon' touch his back

I keep it pimpin' for my paper in my now or later
Made my mark for my spark, terror tear you apart
You better have you some heart, comin' out here after dark

If you gon' start, you must finish, nigga, handle yo' business
Because you spoke like a menace, you got sent off to the dentist
I don't be goin' back and forth like full court tennis
We gon' handle what we gon' handle, have you walkin' in sandals

In a hospital robe, back of your body exposed
I stay in militant mode, I staple holes to your clothes

Shh, half assed niggaz gon' shit on me
If they sentence me to five I'll be out in three
You'll be deep in the dirt for the bugs to eat
Tucked in for eternity, time to sleep

Now do I love them hoes? (HELL NAW!)
And why is that? (Because you're Snoop Doggy Dogg!)
(And you never gave a fuck about a bitch;
'Cause to you, bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks)
Ha hah, dee dee dadi dadi dah
Listen to the sounds from my nigga Doggy Dogg
Slidin through the city in the rag six-fo'
Hoppin like a motherfucker tryin to find a hoe
Hittin all the spots but I'm comin up blank
I'm headed to the liquor store to get myself some drank
Parks my ride as I, steps inside, as I
Puts my nine double-M to my side, as I
Continue with my mission
Pussy is my dish and I'm fishin, wishin
Upon a star, to come up on some ends
But she caviar, and I let her bet her pussy
So I can get my pimp on
'Cause my pen gets my pimp on from G to ozone

I have pimped my pen, on cold Michigan nights
And the bitch didn't freeze up on me, when I wanted her to write it
I have pimped my pen in the hot California sun
And the bitch didn't drip, smell, or run
As she turned the trick pages, from looseleaf to zig-zags
I have pimped my pen and she is number one in my stable
For I have yet not got a refill, for her
I love her that's why she keeps, performing for me
I have pimped my pen, and she is number one, in my stable
Pleasure, is the treasure that the girl sells all day
Pleasure is the reason that she brings daddy his cash
Dedicated the hoe, dedicate for sure
Dripping willows on satin pillows
Love is being checked, from a hoe
Dead presidents still getting their fuck on
I'm so happy because ain't nothing like a lollipop
That gets sucked, ALL day long
A tangy, little candy drop
I love it when she brings me the pay
Dedicated like everyday... to the sunshine
Yeah my hoe brings me mine
For like she says she does
And I believed her when I accept it
Yeah I got pimp bones in my body
And I rock them, like la-di-da-di
I rock them, mighty hardy, like la-di-da-di

Fifty niggaz in a Navigator, and a Range Rover
Blowin bomb sticky doja
Lookin at these studio gangsters gettin over
It's Yuk and Kokane and Nate Dogg, we stay true
Snatch yo wack ass off stage - we all gonna laugh at you
Ah, I wear the same khakis for about four days
And I, I don't brush my teeth, cause I got tooth decay
I keep the door open when I shit
And if I'm fucked up sometimes, I forget to flush it EWWW
Fuck respectin my elders, they ain't gon' get it soft
Cut in front of a 80 year old lady, and flip her ass off
I taught my 13 year old son how to slang

What? Nigga, ery'thang, ery'thang..
Motherfuckers get sprayed fuckin wit Yuk, Kokane and Nate
Since back in the day, been slangin crack nay, packin a gauge
Diamond taps on our braids, pack a case, stack it away
Y'all niggaz perform overseas then back to the states
When subtractions are made, thug money the blueprint
+Regime Killers+, my click too sick, we rule shit
And to spit at a few clicks, rob motherfuckers who move bricks
Pop motherfuckers wit loose lips
Bitches who snitch out's finna get hit, get put in a ditch
Yukmouth runnin, livin this shit
""Ice Cream Man,"" I invented this shit
Ain't no gimmicks to this, my shit is rugged and hardcore
Give Killa Cali niggaz what they starve for
Bring y'all war like, ""What's the issue?""
I shoot up everybody, even an ugly fat bitch too
If I get you (?) (?) another shit on you ridiculous
Give that nigga some tissue, let that bitch know, I'm ig'nant

Are you real motherfuckers, for real motherfucker?
Well I ain't real, I'm ultramagnetic bitch
I'm somethin you don't wanna fuck wit

I'ma eclipse the moon like pitch black nigga

Yak in a 'llac nigga, Young ready to collapse lungs
Two shots make slums collapse niggaz
See me face to face, talk that shit
Pretend you on the +moon+ Michael +walk+ that shit

I met many bitches, in my day
Got the homies on the left side, holdin the 'K

Get mad when a nigga wanna take that knee

The biggest liars of them all
I set fire in the mind and the hearts of the men
That wanna clap but it pop off
No excuses, all applause, revolution, all the soft
Restitution ain't solution for the lives that have been lost

And my pimp niggas keep them hoes
I'm gon' keep on pushin' this pen

With a Mack 11 cocked back ready for sure, ready for war

Then come back in the hood and laugh about that stuff

Loved her like my mother

And I ain't got nuthin but love for my muthafuckin dogs

Beware here I come with the DPG on my chest 
Heat gonna spit like Elliot Ness 
In the darkest zone you feel alone and on your own 
And after I bust, niggaz call me Kurupt Coleone 

All I'm about is money, loot and cash 
Homeys in the DPG Nate, Snoop and Daz 
Now with these emotions how you approach yourself 
Knowin you all about your wealth and as it is to health 

First I pray, get my thoughts intact 
Ask for forgiveness 'cause I'm bout to lay this nigga flat 
Can you adapt, can you feel me, I doubt it 
'Cause the closest you see it, is when niggaz write about it 

I can't live without it and it ain't shit I could do 
But stay down with the homeys in grey and blue 
So just keep the heat close in hand 
'Cause I done see niggaz get shit while they homeboys ran 

Heavenly father shine your light on me 
I know I promise to slow down on this weed 
Seems I remember someone used to say 
One life gets taken, if you take one life away 

(what're ya gonna do) 
When the trials come 
(are ya gonna run?) 
Are you gonna run? 
(what're ya gonna do?)

I thought I'd die

Thought she was sent from the heavens above

Going down I sport the crown I give it up on motherfuckers 
When I roll through I thought you knew about them Doggs in blue 
Now forty-five, niggas bought em by the spot 
I'm on alert I'm down to work every nigga that I shot 
Niggas skied out quick, around the block who know we comin' back 
Post up early on the attack 
Slowly but surely spot an enemy slippin out his domain 
Rode up on him and let him see the twelve gauge 
The homey Ty banged him on GP because we stuffed him then we bagged him 
Cause he violated the rule of the streets 
Two redrums under my belt, it felt good bout to murder 
Haven't you ever heard of a murderer motherfucker? 
Cause I'm, a straight gangsta, doin' what I feel 
Niggas no need to tempt, for me to kill, straight blastin'
The enemy, can't see the hoes who try to get with me 
Understand where I'm comin' from the D-P to the G-the-see 
The niggas who trip, niggas that dipped 
Niggas that conversate with the Bloods or Crips 
It's just a West coast thang, gangsta thing 
Niggas come around here but surely can't hang because-a 
We don't hang with no bustas and sho' nuff 
Don't hang with no fags and niggas down to blast, straight merkin 

[Chorus]

Check it out 
I heard niggas kickin' static makin' noise 
Cold hearted want to get it started with my boys 
Automatic toys to tangle with niggas for profit 
Got shit on lock down cause I lets the Glock spit 
Soon as D-A-Z hits me on my hip, talk about chips 
The game run heatin' them clips, the gaze kicks 
Automatic tech nine spits, I gotta 
Roll with the Pound that's the neighborhood of murder 
Am I the only motherfucker ridin'? 
Am I the only rider but I found a whole pound of niggas violent 
I got the big homey Ty money worldwide 
From Portland, Oregon L.A. to the N.Y. 
I'm bout to crash in your door, unload the double four 
Then stash it, then we blasted all we saw 
The fo'-fo', the fo' double sparkin'
The gang walkin' up your hood like nothin' but trouble 
We straight gangsta shit

That's right 
We dat live by de knife will die by de knife 
You betta try save your life 
On your life dere might be a oversight 
Take my ad-vice and jump in a your ride 
Don't are-gue with de Death Row pride

Kurupt the Kingdom,"[Snoop Dogg]
Josey Wales was known for robbing trains and things
Laying everybody down for diamond rings and chains
It remains the same in the year you live in, see
Cause if I pull out some heat, nigga, you'll go kick in
And that's just the rules set by the fool from the ol' school
When it's time to duel, you get two men
Two heaters, one street, one clock
And when it strike twelve one of y'all gon' drop
If you're quick on the draw you're gon' see the morgue
But if you're too slow
I catch you on the downlow (Oh no)
Oh no, you mean The Kid, shit's real
I ain't no John Wayne, these niggas gang-bang
The Four Horsemen, that's the click I'm wit
You mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers
Yeah, we're on a mission ta Kansas, slipping through Texas
We stopped at Bonanza to get us some hot cakes
Bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg
Hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses
The niggas in black, the fearless Four Horsemen
Searching for this location on the map
The gold rush, baby, got ta have it (I gots ta have it)
It feels just like it's 1865
And a trigger look-a-day is how I ride

[Kurupt]
On and on and on it's more strange
Time to heat, shooting range
Quick with the heat on their hip
Young Jesse James come to test your aim
I seen you at the Wild Horny Corral
I heard of ya name
Tha forcify, nigga you ain't never lie
Besides I'm in the mood so at high noon we ride
From coast to coast, niggas mash on every stage coach
My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts
The off-the-rocker roller coaster
On a six-shooter holster
With DPG on every Wanted poster
Let me think about which bank to gank
Which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank
I want all the shit you got in stacks
Attached to this skirt in the corner
So I snatched the bitch in the back
The Dogg in me feels for the lust
But the hogg in me makes me want to bust
Back to the drawing down board
Nowadays we drawn down more
To survive through all the round wards
Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene
Or get'cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen
I can't help it, I'm heartless, ya can't hack it
With my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket
Like that cock back
Quick to pull my strap
Just to put the Horsemen on the map
(The gold rush)

[LBC Crew]
Born is Doggystyle, individual, James got the hots
I got the six shots for all the plans and plots
I got's lots o' cash stashed in money bags
Worthy workers for all the Russian blabbermouths and gags
I got stacks so my stacks excel
Hop in the coach wit my twelve Clydesdales and bells
I'm on the move, smooth, to my decoy horse
A 30-30 on my side to shoot a nigga o' course
It ain't no stopping young Josey
Box all the nosey
Headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hos be
Left a dusty trail, bailed in swell
Gold spurs on the Gators, set back the clientele
Oh well, for the recop I drop my bet
Divide between my homies and ride the sunset

[Bad Azz]
Two sacks o' money from the train heist
They ain't even counted it up
Just mounted it up
Rode west toward the coaster, six-shooters in the holster
Pass through a run-down town whose walls hold my poster
Closer I get ta death which is every second makes me sweat
So I gotta have what I can get
Heard word about the gold rush and headed West
On my white horsey with three straps in my knapsack
Giddy up, the next town I rode through
I had to threaten to blow their city up
Undebts with Chief Black, caught five miles west
Sell us some beads and hail us some weed
He offered me a toke
He didn't have a 20 he had they beads-pipe smoke
I almost choked
Break him for the get, right, I'm off into the sunset
Trying ta reach my destiny fast
It's these two bags o' cash
44's cocked I ain't making no mo' stops
Till I hit the spot, I made it twelve on the dot
I slid off my boots, counted my loot
Five minutes after the strike of midnight
I counted 200 Gs, I cocked my strap and slept tight

To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee! 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her!

So led by light of a star
Sweetly gleaming,
Here came the wise men
From Orient land.
The King of Kings lay thus
In lowly manger,
In all our trials
Born to be our Friend!
He knows our need,
To our weakness no stranger;
Behold your King!
Before the lowly bend!
Behold your King! your King!
Before Him bend.

Truly He taught us
To love one another;
His law is love and
His gospel is peace.
Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother
And in His name
All oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in
Grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us
Praise His holy name!
Christ is the Lord,
Oh praise His name forever,
His pow'r and glory evermore proclaim
His pow'r and glory
Evermore proclaim.","O, Holy Night",2010

Dr. Octagon paramedic fetus of the East 
With priests I'm from the Church of the Operating Room 
With the strike support scalpels since the holocaust 
I do indeed in greed explore meet the patients 
Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse 
Holding up office lights standing at huge heights 
Back and forth left wing swing to North 
East and South with blood pouring down your mouth 
I come prepared with the white suit and stethoscope 
Listen to your heartbeat, delete beep beep BEEP 
Your insurance is high, but my price is cheap 
Look at the land... Blue Flowers! 
Drawing by the purple pond, in the purple pastures Blue Flowers! 
Drawing by the purple pond, yellow ink that flows Blue Flowers! 
Drawing by the pond, look, it's raining yellow 
Would you care to listen to me more? Thank you 
Holding bags on down right from the hospital 
It's a patient that's worth to keep the germs off the turf 
Cybernetic microscopes and metal antidote 
Two telescopes that magnify the size of a roach 
Three computers to cup of coffee planted with my hand and 
Astroplanets detached turn on rear foggers 
Cut the light on the kid, and turn the bright on 
Supersonic waves combine and burn as brainwaves 
I see the mascot of Evil he's not Knievel 
Shakespeare's gone don't even think about it 
Yes, as I'm going to the park, I see... Blue Flowers! 
It's raining green, by the pond Blue Flowers! 
It's totally raining green, pouring Blue Flowers! 
I smell the bees and the birds Blue Flowers! 
Different aspects of life, blue flowers

Yeah 
Every morning I wake up lookin' in the mirror 
I am the original black Elvis 
That's right; when you see me with my wig to the side 
Wearin' my short leather jacket 
Marilyn Monroe on my back 
I'm livin' that life 
I'm for real with this 
That's what I think about 
I like to tell my fans 

I got my shades, big rock star compared to Elvis 
Signin' autographs for rappers while girls move they pelvis 
Write songs quickly for Elton John or Lionel Richie 
Call up my butler, get clothes washed by the maid 
Ivory soap; this is clean; feel like Cascade 
I count the bills, roll to Detroit in Sedan De villes
I throw my skully on, big robe like Marvin Gaye 
Step in the front row, prime time; I move your way 
Budweiser Fest sound check, demanding more respect 
I come correct through the Metro and turn y'all petrol 
I'm up here early, bitin' donuts, sippin' on espresso 
While you sleep, I creep, gainin' ground by the week 
Ampex reels, makin' phone calls; I'm closin' deals 
I move with skill, ride through Philly streets in Cherry Hill 
I'm doin' it well, I'm doin' it swell 
Yeah 

[Chorus]
Flying saucers, spaceships move at warp speed 
MTV level three when I fly on BET 
Livin' astro; tell me how you feel 
One two, one two 

Movin' roughly, straight to the desert, San Antonio 
I talk swift; the rock king, black Romeo 
I pack clubs; promoters put me out in Tokyo 
Damage your area; I'm a launch a fierce missile 
I roll schools, movin' butt like I'm toilet tissue 
What is your issue? You over, man; I don't miss you 
Scottie soft, you play like Jan Van Breda Kolff 
New Jersey Nets real man; you ain't no Donald Hillman 
Bald head like Slick Watts, I run rap like Mayor Koch 
Forward your info while Tony Lou crank the Benzo 
Move out your driveway; white girls look, turn they eye away 
Jealous in fact, tryin' to rip the capes off my back 
I move with calm and potential through instrumentals 
Y'all front on BET with slum gold, drivin' rentals 
I get real dino, runnin' groups like a rhino 
Endin' careers - that's my job; yo, your rap is final 
Cancel your in-stores; your new job is moppin' floors 
Fixin' tiles, stoppin' potholes up on the roof 
You work for service 
No tips, man, I speak the truth 

[Chorus]

Flying saucers, spaceships move at warp speed 
MTV level three when I fly on BET 
Livin' astro; tell me how you feel 
One two, one two, one two 

Pull your hoods down; I bum rush your after party 
Have your manager scared, the radio station say I'm sorry 
Pack your bags; I move my luggage to the coliseum 
Infinite prime piece with statues in the rock museum 
Changin' my zones, drinkin' cocktails on cellular phones 
I tour with Anthrax through Texas with the Rolling Stones 
Booked by the agency, famous artists payin' me 
Hotels with fly room, with sneakers starin' at the moon 
Mad atmosphere, ridin' first class on British Air 
Lobster and steak while y'all back in time doin' remakes 
I'm futuristic, nine-nine to the year four thousand
I make announcements, drop skills, then I bounce with 
Fly young ladies, AMG kicks, 2000 Mercedes 
Brand new models, only seen one in Colorado 
Light green metallic in the Shark Bar eatin' salad 
Lorenzo Wills, valet park, shoppin' in Beverly Hills 
Step up your wildest spaceship, kid, in the Plymouth Prowler 
Comin' down

KutMasta Kurt,"Yeah..
You motherfuckers oughta let me go and finish this motherfuckin album
Dr. Dooom..
Name of this track is called ""I Don't Want the Motherfuckin Chorus""
Whatever all the arrangements are we gon' go through
Fuck all the laws..

What the fuck was in your mind when you rapped on that track?
Who possessed you to do that? Who programmed - that shit sound wack
Unplug your mic
You motherfuckers rap under a bunch of fuckin hype
Programmed by the company, makin somethin cheap
Vocals sound like a nigga with no dough and a promo;
makin asses out of yourselves, tryin to rap solo
Suck my dick when you see me; avoid because you want to be me
why'all niggaz write like slouches puffin blunts on studio couches
What's up you fuckin amateur?
Your engineer'll cue in your bullshit cadence
That shit sounds simple; look at this nigga rhymin to hisself
Wack as fuck, smell like shit for one buck
Big crews don't want it -- why'all get it worse
Which one of why'all motherfuckers is waitin for the mic first?
I hope your bitch is in the audience
Your wife too, that's your fanbase -- plus your DJ's in the place
I'm about to boo you, let it be fair; when you come off-stage
ninety percent of the people that came on your guest list
ain't gon' be there
A big dissapointment when I rub your asshole with a verbal ointment
Rappers actin hard, nervous in the dressin room
with a security guard
Groupies standin round with they fuckin face frowned
Lookin like fuckin Homey the Clown
Put that Spring Water down man, you ain't sweatin
You motherfuckers did a ten minute weak show and you jettin;
your fans are mad - your performance was garbage bag
Look at these videotapes
Walkin back and forth grabbin your nuts like the Planet of the Apes
Supervise it, criticize it, why'all don't realize it
where the real guys at
Who's administrating your budget when you takin 
that high picture for Right On with your ballroom light on
You know the night is kind of special like Lowenbrau
when I escort you to your car, you breakout bastards
Leave the premises and reminisce on your rookie season after you first started
You try to work hard and you never paid no dues like Cold Crush and Afrika Bambaata
You wack nigga, tryin to act large in the video in Nevada
You fuckin pink maggot; I'll take your mic, you can't have it
You niggaz be runnin around with ears open like fuckin bunny rabbits

That's right, Dr. Dooom
All you motherfuckers around the world sittin in studios with your boys
Hypin your shit up
Motherfuckers don't want to tell you that your shit is wack
because they all yes men
Sittin around, carryin your roadie cases
Bein your fuckin cheerleaders
I'ma tell you straight, look in the fuckin mirror, you wack
That shit don't sound right, your mixdown ain't right
Your vocals are too low.. your fuckin cadence is off

Niggas step back with Dax grease, watch their ass twist

Drinking vodka, Absolut, sipping Tanqueray 
Mc's jump off, I stung your rectum like a stingray

Gimme drunk enough I'll probably bink a friend
Rumble in my belly
Head is in the toilet
I will never ever get drunk again
I'm talkin bout them other cats
Drinkin a little boo and then they had enough of that
Dark is what I do can never get enough yak
But when I do what I do while they mixin em
What I gotta ask
Sane lookin man gon make me three
Cups of delicious K.C. Tea
That's Hennesy, Sprite and lemon
If you got better than that you gotta make me see
Off in the club fucked up
And I got all of my bucks up
Twenty women at the bar right next to me
Every one of them just lucked up
Saturday night Voodoo Loungin it
'Cause P & L club's got boo boo sounds in it
All twenty comin with the crew who's down to hit
Til the break of dawn wit a new new poundin it

Like Jesus created two of me
Haters they make me famous
So I'm deservin an Oscar
Walkin by niggas notice my swagger's disturbin they posture
But I don't ever pranks bein gangsta got a steady aim
Cause the K will make them feel more hits than Teddy Pain

Aimlessly lookin for faded hoes who wanna get naked
Cause bitch it's under rated
So pour me another drink

But the name of the game is to have fun

After the club we usually go straight to Chubby's
That's where the 3 in the morning grub be
And even though Icons is lovely
Tonight the pad is gonna be a must see
'Cause hussies are coming to give up they pussies, trust me
They comin' to muff me, plus three:
Makzilla, Irv and Big Nick we's 'bout to bust V
Open until we lust free, she sucked D
Gushed me, then roughly rode this ding-a-ling like a Huffy
Luck-ily, another 36 cup D abruptly, came into the room to fuck me
She said, ""Tecca Nina touch me, your dick is thick and husky
It must be like a ride at Cedar Point in Sandusky""
Well, what do you know, baby girl rushed me
The TNA was so silky and fluffy, unjustly I crushed, B!
And not one of these broads is ugly, 'til the next morning
When they crawl in they hubby Snuggie, looking rough as rugby

Yeah, we hit the spot if we choose her
Then she dipping out
To take her to my house (It's the after party)
We can all (Get naughty)
And take our clothes off

You can take the under-route
Tell your man you at your mama house
No but really (It's the after party)
And we all (Get naughty)
And take our clothes off

Full of that liquor, ready to stick all this dick up in a-uh
Bitch out at Nina's, I never seen but I'm fixing to fuck
Already popping I'm running late, but just minutes away
Was told to grab condoms from up at Wal-Mart and bring 'em with me
Soon as I enter, my cock's attending a chicken brigade
Somebody's pussy's about to get cooked, rather chicken filleted
Found me a victim, we made our way through the kitchen escape
Into the garage and the lip massages was about to began
Lethargically sucking, hardly fucking with Pinky to me
So I told the slut to hike up her butt and let Kutt intervene
All in her guts in between, the Benz and the bucket and screamed
""Nigga you're fucking my whole lining up with my husband to be
Drowning too much and if he-"" shut the fuck up and I ease out
Take off the condom and I sprout on her butt with relief
Just another episode of back to naughty
Tecca Nina I can't thank you enough for the after party

[Chorus]

When freaks come out at night, the freakiest stays out the latest
They hit the after party, they got somebody take care of they baby
So it's cool, no rules, no security guards
Let your hair down, yeah, now do what you want
Man fire up the weed, whenever you please, best believe
That you got the green light, the special guest is me
And we've, been drinking and smoking all night
It's time to find a ho to be stroking my pipe
A bitch quickly grabbed my dick and asked why it was so soft
I said that it wouldn't go off, she gave it a quick blow off
And she did and me dick start to rise
She opened her eyes to a surprise and
Her thighs was moist, it was my choice to go up in it
For a minute put my dick up in it, she said it was splendid
She usually charge niggas, they like to rent it
I told her put it on my bill bitch and send it

I should've never drank that liquor
I should've used a condom
But that's my bad something I got to live with it
If I had my choice to do it all again
I would've kept it moving without even acknowledging your existence
About the deadest beat, mama a child could never have a coke
Using alcoholic, you foul with no class
Sitting, waiting on the checks the arrive that you cash
Don't even spend it on my son then wanna turn around and ask me for more money
Trying to get more from me, bitch I got 7 seven mouths to feed
You think that you the only person with a kid
Trying to pay the bills, how about getting off your lazy ass
To work at a job it's been years
You think that just because you provide a place to live
That's raising them? nah that's just rumor in your crib
Your ol mama said I need to come and grab it quick
That's a shame when the grandma saying you wanna fuck

Exercising it's use, gotta sit around listen to all your verbal abuse
Because your life ain't shit so when you get hurt from the truth
Go and take it out on him cause life ain't working for you
He looking for a job and I'm bout to buy him a car
You ain't never had a job and you live at the local bar
Sleeping with everybody and being the ho you are
When he graduated he coming straight to me and his step mama
Smack in the face saying you mad cause
I make payments out to his grandma
Cause she got my son back faded
While you got the courts up in our business about a back payment
Bitch I ain't no Eminem so why you trying to act shady

A mass aching freak I need to cover my dick up
Ain't gotta, don't gotta, can't keep a job
But you want up the child support and get it modified
Paying every month and piano lessons too
What I do for my 7 kids most niggas wouldn't even do
For one why you talking, you think because I'm tuned
And I got money out the cooling bitch, you better to walking
It's about the q tip that we spend when it over
Nothing about you and me but you bending me over
Trying to fuck with no grease I be fuse to be over
Don't except nothing else that's what I told her so

Fused my dust from a light year,
Squeezed me to her breast, sowed me with carbon,
Strung my warp across time
Gave me each a horse, sunrise and graveyard,
Told me only I was her

Built the sky for my dawn 

Cleaned my feet of mud, followed the empty
Zebra ride to the cirkus,
Past a painted cage, spoke to the paybox
Glove which wrote on my tongue
Pushed me down a slide to the arena,
Megaphonium fanfare.
In his cloak of words strode the ringmaster
Bid me join the parade

Making bandsmen go clockwork,
See the slinky seal cirkus policeman;
Bareback ladies have fish.""

Acrobatically juggling-
Bids his tamers go quiet the tumblers
Lest the mirror stop turning

Ate the floors of their cages.

Hit the light switch

Why sip the glass when you can have the bottle

But visualize the place maybe you can relate
For her I give my arm hoping she amputates
But still it aint enough
Its way to late but I'm like wait
She like she did she said she tired of waiting
Its already been years and theres been tears shed
I was gone til November than I show on that lear jet
Like yeah I'm rich man I really don't care
Throw a little money in the air
Blinded by the cars I was blinded by the ice
Millionaire lens I was blinded by the light
One look at her face and I was remind by the life
That I used to live that she used to light

[Chorus]

All we do is argue
All we do is fight
I'm just tryin to get it back to which shit is too nice
But it will never be that she said
And you can never be that prepared as long as your aware
She don't know how to stop the hurt
So for now I'm just a tear
And since I was a jerk she wish I would disappear
But that's what got us here and that's whats gotta go
You reap what you sew
So I'ma let her know

Well I came here for something funky to happen
Is this Christmas 'cause everybody's rappin
You better get sparked by the song that I sing
Although my name ain't Martin Luther
But I'm considered the king
yo, my beats pumped by the mic I clamp
I don't need an amplifier
my brain is the amp
I got the beats that make you tingle
make your body mingle
Like you got the fever for the flavor of a Pringle
Weak I say not so
I'm just like Picasso
A pioneer
I am here
Ask me how I got so fly
Any sense that I can give 'em
a New Beginning Stevie-o
and my dope rhythm
I sent the Lord master give a mental harm
My sole chief belief is that Islam
My beats pumped so let it grab ya
I got a trick but my name ain't Ali-Babba
So open Sessame
Neva heard the best of me
Betcha all the people intheplaceiswacknowlet'ssee
It's a New Beginning, my name Kwame
And if you didn't know I could tell you that I'm a
Mellow cool brotha
Slicker than oil
Rap get so hot it makes the spit boil
The Rhythm

Not the avarage rapper the K is more
Ryhmes like the thunderbolt of the mighty Thor
Pick a cell 'cause I can conquer boy
I break MCs like a Tonka Toy
Smooth suave savage yet debonair
Come in the party yeah I see you stop and stare
To hear the man to only have yo hand shook
You dress too cute to me you have the Jordache look
'cause I'm the mystical
Rap is polyphysical
Ask about Kwame 
hey say he is a  musical fellow
he always mellow
He's neva highstung spunk
and when the mic is near him
it cleva I run smooth like Moet
recite just like a poet
Ain't my slam oh man I know it
'cause when I'm on the mic while boys say oh golly
chick on my tip like a hip on poly grip
I go cameo be on the grammy show
I be sleek as a sheik out freak ganny ho
in the panty hose pumping close
yo my rhymes slam well I suppose 'cause
I'm might neader um go washin that again
to write a fresh rhyme you know I can again
'cause I destroy plus I'm like a hemmorid
strong like a steroid avoid the Noid
The Rhythm

The black can take the M A X
And as I step in the party that's when they ask
for me to get on strong no fear like a Gladiator
turn on steam up MC like a radiator
Play 'em all out executioner style
Speak my peace just release refusing to smile
This is serious though I rap a little humor
But still MC I hear assume I could neva
bust a fat rap twice
and at that price 
on any mic you gave me I got nice
A push a pull up a sit up get up I'm fed up
shut ya lip up and let's go head up
Poisionus as venom no mistakes in 'em
Gucci on silk you got Vasco in denim
No my name ain't taco Emilio or Paco 
but Kwame boy and I got yo 
Chick on the side 'cause she sweatin' my tip
Gave a peck on the neck just to wetten my lip
I don't drop my pants for those Raggedy Anns
just to pass up a chance on a kids romance
I should have blown this mic

A photograph, what brought me right back to the past

Quite nerd type, that wanted to be amongst the
Older, bolder, colder crowd
With fat gold chains and strolled around
In tucked silk suits, hundred dollar Bally boots
Hat to a tilt and a felt substitute 
Fashions my have seemed to have worked
But it seems I was a fake, and fakes look like jerks
All I could do is scheme
Hoping that one day I'll be on the top of the team
No matter how hard I tried, I'd just collide
With being a fool and an old guy
It didn't work, and that annoyed

A new girl came to school and I must say
I slid, skid, crashed and got a crush 
On her and all other things seemed like a bluff
I wouldn't dare to speak, didn't say a word
Trying to be a big boy, I just became a nerd
Doubting myself, thinking I'm all sissy and all
Either I was too short, too shy, or too small
Which was a sign of ignorance
So I brought up confidence
The next day I'm panicking
Stiff as a mannequin
What do you know

But there's tomorrow, the next day she came
Arm and arm with some dude, with some gangster name 
Hopes and dreams in a flash were destroyed
All because of the fuss of oneovdabigboiz

Or get a cut, like someone else's hair

Be in my own swing, know what I'm saying

Are you ashamed, of original black? 
If you're not, why does your hair look like that? 
Why is your nose straighter, from surgery? 
I think you're really in a state of emergency 
You're not sane to the African aim 
So you're insane, and you need to obtain 
Any, average rap album sculpture

Tryin' hard, to be Mr. Tuffy 
Yet in fact, you're Mr. Softie 
With the beige contacts on, yo you lost me 
I ain't with it, never will, never have 
How can your son even call you dad? 
Your skin is bleached and your nails you just buffin' 
Take a look at yourself man, ya strugglin' 

Africa is so strong, that once she puts a stamp on you 
Four hundred years of cold weather, death, 
And all that fryin' your hair shall not disguise you 
As a matter of fact, she is so strong 
That no matter what chemicals you put in your hair 
She will come back and snatch it up 

Tell me 
Are you proud man, of who you are? 
Or does your pride come out of a jar 
'Cause if you bought it, put it on, or sprayed it on 
I tell you right now, it won't stay long 
'Cause if it ain't natural, it ain't kosher 
It's like buyin' and wearin' a culture 
If that culture ain't yours naturally 
It's his, not yours, actually 
You better wake up and smell the coffee 
Look in the mirror and think Mr. Softie 
People change, when they are ashamed 
Of how they look or from which they came 
Are you ashamed, of original black? 
If you're not, why does your hair look like that? 
Why is your nose straighter, from surgery? 
I think you're really in a state of emergency 
You're not sane to the African aim 
So you're insane, and you need to obtain 
Any, average rap album sculpture 
And study it, just, to learn your culture 
Even though, you don't think it's music 
It's the blackest you'll ever get so use it 
The blue-eyed black man to me is buggin' 
Take a look at yourself man, ya strugglin' 

Yes capitalism will confuse these people, have them totally confused 
They will try every way to identify with their masters, every way 
Go to extreme lengths, I'm telling you, seriously! 
Capitalism will confuse them why'know tell them the truth's a lie 
I saw a sister the other day and I spoke to her about her hair 
She said, ""I don't care what you say, I'm still gonna get my perm!"" 
I told her, ""It's not a perm, it's a temporary"" 
Try in every possible way to identify",Ya Strugglin',1990

and rip into you fine as wine, sublime the kind

They rip into ya night to night, recite the type, of written 
Come inside the light, tonight's the night, we give it to ya 

Comin' back to stay, when I rap this way 
Blowin' minds wit' these lyrics out my fact-oray 
That are practic-ally, on some maste-ray 
Show you all how a funky record has to be 
Not to toot my horn, I'm from Californ 
It's the +cheese+, not the kind that's grown from cows in barns 
But the kind that meets your needs in like a thousand forms 
As we dance to the ever flowin' masquerade 
Homey, pass the J, homies pass away 
Over pride when another nigga blast a K 
Evil thought hearts chilly, Dickie Dastard-lay 
All his people mourned deeply as the pastor prayed 
Come though from out of town, you wouldn't last a day 
All they know is long money and assassination 
Get it now, not tomorrow, don't procrastinate 
This is my grind, verbal slangin', I'm a master fate 
In a drastic way, this is class so pay 
Close attention, write all night 'til I gasp and faint

Golden voice wit' style, spirit poised for power 
Definition of a goddess, I'm a poster child 
As I boast about, here's a dose fo' trail 
Evil spirits don't concern me, tell the ghost be out! 
Shine my light to dim, all the spite within 
Competition, 'cause at times, I know we frighten them 
All we really wanna do is give some sight to them 
All my people, New York City to the coast of Cal 
I'm the toast of towns, I'm the cat's meow 
Movin' faster than your mind, come and catch me now 
Niggaz see me on stage and wanna ask me out 
I'm the true original never a hand-me-down 
When I flash no doubt, know that ass is out 
Nefertiti, Mama Zulu, try and pass the Nile 
Take your breath away it's like you're catchin' asthma now 
In this verbal marathon, you couldn't last a mile because...

Lyrics Born to rap, I put it all on that 
Twelve years deep, my foot ain't comin' off the gas 
We walk the chosen path, close the culture gap 
O.G. like the Figure-Four the Boston Crab 
All across the map, beyond the almanac 
You see the backstage posted lookin' so relaxed 
Lady wit' me, open toe, lil' shoulder bag 
Hat tipped just a bit, ooh she cold like that 
Where my ballers at? If you can call it that 
Potna' both you and me know that shit is boulderdash 
We see right through yo phony ass like youse a holograph 
We so real, when they see us, it's like they pause and gasp

Cross they arms, turn they heads like they was Ultraman 
We gotcha whole clique surrounded in a cul-de-sac 
So baby get ta jump-ropin' over a broken glass because...

"Kweli, Talib & Hi Tek","These cats is no match, plus they lack a certain knack for rapping
They never catch the wagon like Re-run and ""What's Happening""
Since back when they had potty issues and snotty tissues we been rockin
Think you poppin next year nobody will miss you
My thoughts is too advanced for the artists on these labels
They come sweeter than sabal and softer than mashed potatoes
I tried to told you the rhymes run over emcees like Land Rovers
Took 'em back in time like Sankofa, Sankofa

We stand over the Atlantic, looking broad like a man's shoulders
The fire is trapped in a belly, ready to pop like canned soda
We outlasting, from middle passage
Touched down in New York
Cincinnatay! Big Ohio status what you thought
Money it's classic these bastards try to treat us like cattle
So life has been a constant battle, battle
Rising above the crabs in the barrel
Way too used to living in death's shadow
We stay on point like the best arrow, arrow
We hit the target accurate
Star shit, back it up
When we hit town, y'all niggas pack it up
That's how we get down, straight smash it up
Like a whip, hydroplaning
Hydro on the brain and maintaining
Game changing into subtle shit, we remain blatant
Yo, got to tell you to your face
You get replaced in this game, by Kweli
Place the face with the name
These cats drink champagne and toast to death and pain
Like slaves on a ship talking about who got the flyest chain

We the reflection of our ancestors
We'd like to thank you for the building blocks you left us
Cause your spirit possessed us
Yo, you blessed us

Make your foul ice grill, thug grimy on the real
Puttin heads to bed like Hennessey and NyQuil

Convertible style, still had the heat knockin
Bumpin shit from way back with my man beatboxin
Shootin the breeze - see I'm nice with these
You'll be suckin it down like fast food high-see's
Type of rap bitch that love underground classics
Gettin more green than that nigga St. Patrick
Makin wack rappers go and merc the set {*dial-up sounds*}
Better off behind a desk tryin to surf the net
Cause I be adamant, kill 'em when my joints get added in
Worse than boric acid in your project cabinet
Dirty Harriet, increase the fanbases

Givin niggaz battle scars, ALWAYS makin my mark
You fakin the part of gangster, til niggaz break in your spot
You straight bitch whether I say it or not
Shit is hot, spittin flames on the track
Put our town's names on the map
From now until we fadin to black
Where we at? Thug rebels love metal clubs ghetto
When the slugs let go like Frankie Beverly
Forever we stack notes like the treasury, flow heavenly
Get you high on speech laced with obscenity
Niggaz be gassed like Cipher Sounds, and need rescue remedy
Then fall the fuck off like limbs affected with leprosy

One, two, three, four
Why the fuck can't MC's MC no more?
Hardcore til somebody put me under the ground
With a dick in your ear, still couldn't fuck with my sound
One, two, three, four
Takin me straight to the weed spot, then to the liquor sto'
""Gimme Some Mo'"" like Busta Bus', who do you trust?
Swingin through, your favorite neighborhood lush

I'm I-rate, usin your body for live bait
Xzibit rockin them heavy gems you can't take
Dilate, cock back the weight, spread hate
Heavy metal we settle and set shit straight
Hit gates in my younger days, from the policeman
Me and my clan used to dance thicker than quicksand
Supply and demand the hand is quicker than the eye
Find some chickens to fry, while you find it hard to stick to your lie
I see through the tricks, destroy the facade
Your little lungs is too weak to hotbox with God

Gotta be hard like a young nigga walkin the yard

"Kweli, Talib & Hi Tek","Yea, so we got this tune called ""for women"" right
Originally, it was by nina simone
She said it was inspired by, you know
Down south, in the south, they used to call her mother antie
She said no mrs.
Just antie
She said if anybody ever called her antie
She'd burn the whole goddamn place down
I'm over past that
Coming into the new millenium, we can't forget our elders

I got off the 2 train in brooklyn on my way to a session
Said let me help this woman up the stairs before I get to steppin'
We got in a conversation she said she a 107
Just her presence was a blessing and her essence was a lesson
She had her head wrapped
And long dreads that peeked out the back
Like antenna to help her get a sense of where she was at, imagine that
Livin' a century, the strenght of her memories
Felt like an angel had been sent to me
She lived from nigga to colored to negro to black
To afro then african-american and right back to nigga
You figure she'd be bitter in the twilight
But she alright, cuz she done sseen the circle of life yo
Her skin was black like it was packed with melanin
Back in the days of slaves she packin' like harriet tubman
Her arms are long and she moves like song
Feet with corns, hand with callouses
But her heart is warm and her hair is wooly
And it attract a lot of energy even negative
She gotta dead that the head wrap is her remedy
Her back is strong and she far from a vagabond
This is the back of the masters' whip used to crack upon
Strong enough to take all the pain, that's been
Inflicted again and again and again and again and flipped
It to the love for her children nothing else matters
What do they call her? they call her aunt sara

I know a girl with a name as beautiful as the rain
Her face is the same but she suffers an unusual pain
Seems she only deals with losers who be usin' them games
Chasin' the real brothers away like she confused in the brain
She tried to get it where she fit in
On that american dream mission paid tuition
For the receipt to find out her history was missing and started flippin'
Seeing the world through very different eyes
People askin' her what she'll do when it comes time to chose sides
Yo, her skin is yellow, it's like her face is blond word is bond
And her hair is long and straight just like sleeping beauty
See, she truly feels like she belong in 2 worlds
And that she can't relate to other girls
Her father was rich and white still livin' with his wife
But he forced himself on her mother late one night
They call it rape that's right and now she take flight
Through life with hate and spite inside her mind
That keep her up to the break of light a lot of times
(I gotta find myself)
She had to remind herself
They called her safronia the unwanted seed
Blood still blue in her vein and still red when she bleeds
(Don't, don't, don't hurt me again)

Teenage lovers sit on the stoops up in harlem
Holdin' hands under the apollo marquis dreamin of stardom
Since they was born the streets is watchin' and schemin'
And now it got them generations facin' deseases
That don't kill you they just got problems
And complications that get you first
Yo, it's getting worse, when children hide the fact that they pregnant
Cuz they scared of giving birth
How will I feed this baby?
How will I survive, how will this baby shine?
Daddy dead from crack in '85, mommy dead from aids in '89
At 14 the baby hit the same streets they became her master
The children of the enslaved, they grow a little faster
They bodies become adult
While they keepin' the thoughts of a child her arrival
Into womanhood was heemed up by her survival
Now she 25, barely grown out her own
Doin' whatever it takes strippin', workin' out on the block
Up on the phone, talkin' about
(My skin is tan like the front of your hand)
(And my hair)
(well my hair's alright whatever way I want to fix it,
It's alright it's fine)
(But my hips, these sweet hips of mine invite you daddy)
(And when I fix my lips my mouth is like wine)
(Take a sip don't be shy, tonight I wanna be your lady)
(I ain't too good for your mercedes, but first you got to pay me)
(You better quit with all the question, sugar who's little girl am i)
(Why I'm yours if you got enough money to buy)
(You better stop with the compliments we running out of time,)
(You wanna talk whatever we could do that it's your dime)
(From harlem's from where I came, don't worry about my name,)
(Up on one-two-five they call me sweet thang)

A daughter come up in georgia, ripe and ready to plant seeds
Left the plantation when she saw a sign even thought she can't read
It came from god and when life get hard she always speak to him
She'd rather kill her babies than let the master get to 'em
She on the run up north to get across that mason-dixon
In church she learned how to be patient and keep wishin'
The promise of eternal life after death for those that god bless
She swears the next baby she'll have will breathe a free breath
And get milk from a free breast
And love beeing alive
Otherwise they'll have to give up being themselves to survive
Being maids, cleaning ladies maybe teachers
Or college graduates, nurses, housewives, prostitutes, and drug addicts
Some will grow to be old women, some will die before they born
They'll be mothers, and lovers who inspire and make songs
(But me, my skin is brown and my manner is tough,)
(Like the love I give my babies when the rainbow's enuff,)
(I'll kill the first muthafucka that mess with me, I never bluff)
(I ain't got time to lie, my life has been much too rough,)
(Still running with barefeet, I ain't got nothin' but my soul,)
(Freedom is the ultimate goal
Life and death is small on the whole, in many ways)
(I'm awfully bitter these days
'Cuz the only parents god gave me, they were slaves,)
(And it crippled me, I got the destiny of a casualty,)
(But I live through my babies and I change my reality)
(Maybe one day I'll ride back to georgia on a train,)

"Kweli, Talib & Hi Tek","These niggas ain't thugs, the real thugs is the government
Don't matter if you independent, democrat or republican
Niggas politickin the street, get into beef
Start blastin, now a new cat is executive chief
With a, passion for heat you get, blast in yo' seat
Die before you crash in yo' Jeep, never passion in your sleep
Like an old man, you ain't a fool you got a whole plan
To conquer territories like Europeans who stole land
The future of your whole fam' hang in the balance
You the king, and your block is the palace
Y'all niggas is the parliament, untouchable, spot unrushable
Keep your weight wet, call in collect to save a buck or two
Get mad, who the fuck are you? What you gonna do?
Exactly what I thought, NOTHIN, in the sport of frontin
You the undisputed champion, I'm in a class you can't be in
My words is flesh like Jesus, the aquarian

It's just a chapter of the night, in the ghetto afterlife
Where you just seen or heard about or gonna have to fight
Where they sacrifice the life and niggas see flashes of light
When you trapped up in the heights but clappers aimin at the wife

Yeah, dudes gettin money is still thuggin
Chicks gettin money is still ghetto
Still livin the whole thuggish stilleto
Your team let the metal burst before you take an L
You raised in hell, let the dust settle first
Then you ask the question, snatchin the life of the innocent
Shit happens huh, a man's respected by his actions
It's the karma of the street, you try to meet the karma
While the karma sleep, yo it's deep, but the karma can't be beat
You don't know your enemy, so you fightin with yourself
Relate to rap niggas cause they writin what you felt
You got top shelf connects you gettin seasoned like a veteran
We suck the venom out the snake bite, without the medicine
We benefit from niggas in tenements, dyin for benjamins
So bad that they know they own coffin measurements
Ghetto eloquence, in the moment of truth, don't be hesistant
Or fall victim to the element, word is bond

Just another chapter of the night, in the ghetto afterlife
Where you just seen or heard about or gonna have to fight
Where they sacrifice the life and niggas see flashes of light
When you trapped up in the heights but clappers aimin at the wife

Niggas get caught up in the struggle
End up in court in trouble, sportin a bubble
Ford azure bubble, importer smuggle, forcin a rumble
Hit the blocks with a portion to double
Flip and get tossed in the huddle
Police with one piece short of the puzzle
It's a hustle, peep the street life, they movin muscle
And the G's'll make your knees buckle
Tussle with heat until your feet stand in a pee puddle
Cheese double but all the speedy niggas bleed puddles
Make the headlines; some try to escape the fed time
Phone taps on direct lines - tec-9's with the red shine
Jake climbin through the bedroom blinds
Tryin to bring you to your deadline, it's slippery when wet signs
Red time, wipe the sweat around your neck time
One shot spill out your red wine, rock shots to deafen your prime
Pieces of hot lead left in your mind
One slug to the left of your spine
Forever late to rest on the shrine",Ghetto Afterlife,2000
"Kweli, Talib & Hi Tek","What's the meanin of ghetto fabulous
Not ridin the back of the bus
I'm a revolutionary antagonist
Some playas is mad at us for just doin our music out of love
Some underground heads is hatin cause we have fun at clubs
I'm probably on some government list for my rhymin
You a fool if you don't think they already tapped your line
Medicine is big business so my remedies is herbal
It's music is for the people so we Reflection Eternal
Listen, you hear the difference between science and science fiction
We blow it out like if you leave on every appliance in the kitchen
at once, still rolling kind bud in Cuban blunts
On the corner watchin how kids comin to Brooklyn for they fronts
Niggas run past what they need chasing after what they want
Fuckin chumps, you walk down the street and get jumped
Brooklyn cats like to bubble out of town no lookin back
When you a ghetto chef you mastered the art of cookin crack
Some get caught sleepin on the Mother City so when they go
They come back as tales of niggas we used to know
Never looked up to see the stars in all they heavenly glory
Just straight ahead cause the peripheral is buildings with mad stories
Not floors but dramas is played out, shorties get laid out
like respect and fade out like TV sets
into the banks of our memories (let it be) we'll never forget you
Lyin on your deathbed askin for God to bless you

Good mourning, good afternoon, good night
What have you done with your life?
Everybody time comes to be embraced by the light
You only scared to die when you ain't livin right, man
I'm puttin up a hellafied fight

I need you all to be clear on exactly what I'm sayin
With your attention span I understand that I ain't playin
You mistaken if you somehow think it's just me you facin
Starin me down while your enemy is standin adjacent
My heart is racin but I know just what I stand for
We chasin death carelessly like +Jessica+, I +Care Moore+
Who said, ""Just because no one can understand how you speak
don't necessarily mean that what you be sayin is deep""
In case you die in your sleep you ask the Lord for a blessin
Sometimes they sneak up so quiet that the silence is deafenin
You'll never know who the assassin is until it's your time to go
Your life is flashin, askin for forgiveness but you move too slow
Now the people that you love bear the pain that you once harbored
You was livin for yourself so you could never be a martyr
Life is hard, death is harder; you somebody baby father
Someone's lover, son of your mother, somebody brother
Somebody nigga, now your spirit in the air like a whisper
Hearin your name mentioned when we pourin out some liquor
The days go by quicker and the nights don't seem to differ
It's gettin cold, so I shivered and asked my soul to be delivered

Good mourning, good afternoon, good night
What have you done with your life?
Everybody time comes to be embraced by the light
You only scared to die when you ain't livin right, man
I'm puttin up a hellafied fight

Yo, the time come for everybody
It ain't somethin' you can really prepare for

Yo, yo, Mad Duke, rock rock on and
Curtis Mayfield, rock rock on and
Grover Washington, rock rock on and

"Kweli, Talib & Hi Tek","Yo, we're going to have the word love
In many different languages translated all through the track
So, whenever you hear the word love
Know that, it's going to be in a different language
The language of love cannot be translated, yo

Love is blind, you just see bright light
You up in the club feelin' the night life, lookin' for the right type
Blood rushing to your heart making it beat
When she swept you off your feet and made it complete
You know the plan you had to conquer the world
Thinking you Scarface, looking for that perfect girl
And now you found her
Started with romantic, then got to frantic
Then things that's normally small become gigantic
Now y'all sinkin' like the Titanic here come the panic
Bein' with you like a habit without you I can't stand it
It's tragic when you wonder when you lost that magic
Without understanding that you never had it try to grab it
In the bed gettin' a nut off, communication cut off
Getting mad cause you turned or wondering where she shut off
Constantly comparing you to someone in my past
We don't smile anymore, and we argue over cash
Advance to that physical shit
See what happens if you keep talkin'
See what happens if you lay a finger on me motherf
Yo, see what I'm sayin'
It's like one big mind game that everybody playin and
Niggas say bitches is trife, bitches say niggas is
We just don't understand our fundamental differences
I'm still learning though, actually
I just do what come naturally, naturally, naturally

L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)
Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)
J'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)
Et je t'ai trouve (And I found you)

Women thrive on emotions, men refuse to acknowledge
So when we arguin nobody win
Words get in the way time and again
Sticks and stones break your bones words break your heart
Whether you in touch with that part or not say ""word""
Words are weapons for the revolutionary
Used for evil make the situation very scary
Word up, but love is brave
It flies in the face of fear
Yo, wherever you want to go love'll take you there
Let's go, you know a flower that grow in the ghetto
Know more about survival than the one from fresh meadows
It got love for the sun, that's where I'm comin' from
Spit in this fashion cause I love rockin' over drums
Word (te quiero) I put my love into my music
If you with me then you love how I do it
If my heart you're livin' in your ocean I'm swimmin' in
Never drowning got me floatin' watching you in slow motion
Love potion overdosin' approachin'
The explosion of my senses everyday without your heart
Is like a sentence in jail
Trust I'll always be mentally free
You got the key to let it out I'll show you how it could be
Love {*different language*} it ain't nuttin' but a word
A chicken ain't nuttin' but a bird
Yo, yo, yo

Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)

Some of y'all in love with that material but
Love enter my life like a miracle and
It reciprocal that's why I'm feeling you love
We exibit our natural behavior
Like making love under the moon in Jamaica
Get you so hot you call the name of the creata
The morning we hop back into action again
Up on the wall lovin' how the sun blacken your skin
Remember when we explored the beach
Swam in the ocean and saw beneith
How the colors of the coral reef looked like the illest floral peice
That's what your beauty remind me of
It's hard to find a love like ours, taking it high above
Them other duns try to spit game but, I dont sweat it though
Know in my heart that we connected so I let it go
Now if they call you out your name and that's a different thing
Anything but Queen I'll go to war like a King
Your friends sweat you cause you ain't got a band
But they don't understand
Some things is meant to stay between a woman and man
And they ain't privy to it so they try to get into it
Both you and me see through it so the way we flow is fluid
We speak the love language, they speak from pain and anguish
Some don't love theyselves so they perception is tainted
Out they joint like ""Shit, he payin for your rent"" missin' the point
When you rub me into your skin just like an ointment
It's more than pillow talk, it can't be translated
Learn how to speak it, and become emancipated
It's a language

Universal love

Get a collection of all the music and everything we've ever done

Bringing back sweet memories

Life, living in flatbush and going to house parties
Red lights, bumping, life is what you make it, then sorry
In my lifetime, ain't done too many things
Better than watching your first son put his sentences together
Yo, it kinda make me think of way back when
I was the portrait of the artist as a young man
All them teenage dreams of rapping
Writing rhymes on napkins
Was really visualization
Making this shit actually happen
It's like something come through me
That truly just consume me
Speaking through the voices of the spirits speaking to me
I think back in the day, I absorbed everything like a sponge
Took a plunge into my past to share with my son

Bringing back sweet memories

Like thoughts out the back of my mind
Going back in some time
Like when you used to cut and had to go to the back of the line
Look back and you find
Tracks that make you relax and recline
Now cats rap about packing a nine
When they lacking divine
Inspiration
Running out of topics of conversation
Well I drop it in the pocket because rocking's my occupation
I do it remarkably, spark up a leaf
And possibly you could follow me
Tap into your chi
Utilize your memory
To help you see clearly, then get back to me
Actually, nothing's new under the sun
So when life be stressing me
My remedy is 'bringing back sweet memories'
Like the faces that are woven in the fabric of my consciousness
From cities where making 21's a big accomplishment
Like when my people understood their prominence
And my past life visions of the continent
Like the first time I saw krs live, rockin' it
I heard resurrection by common sense
Dominant in my psyche
I chose my direction like spike lee
To speak my life through mics, and I never take it lightly
It might be something you did to bring you down when you were high
But that karma's a bitch, you steady asking god why
Like when my parents first split up
Yo, I was illin'
Seems like some years they was together for the sake of the children
And I love them for that
I don't know if they saw that
So I'mma say it, and convey it when the world play it (3x)

Bringing back sweet memories

Like black is beautiful, names from the seventies
Let me tap into your energy
Fields of dreams become my property
When I reach my destiny like a prophecy
Especially when I 'm 'bringing back sweet memories'
I got deep into my mind, see I got a treasury
That float through my head like a sweet melody
What you telling me
Reflection is a collection of memories
Definitely this is how hiphop was meant to be
Eventually, I knew I'd run into hi-teknology
It was only a matter of time like centuries
Check the recipe or technique to how it sound so sweet
I freak with word power, my man speak with beats
If I could make it in new york, I figured anywhere I'd make it
Came to cincinnati linked with mood, and we did sacred
Hi-tek beats became my favorite
Hustle on the side was the cut
We started to put songs together like 'what!'
Traveled the world, came back to the crib
And hit the motherland
Yeah, this year we put in work and got some other plans
In fact, that's where I'll take the fam
When the reflection joint is done
By the time you hear this, I'll be basking in african sun

We made it

Express my desire to drop this new shit

Your next of kin an' shatter stories splattered in the tabloids
Erase your trace like your cotton mouth and we pepperment altoids
Step in the high reppin the spot called flatbush
Whether rappers or actors you still feel the gat bust
The abstract then becomes the reality
Alcoholics like to call it the moment of clarity

I got you, say no more i laid the law and all them
Crab rappers played the floor I called them out
A couple of them steeped up and I ate 'em raw

Niggas so hollow that they echo like sentiments

Nowadays rap artists coming half-hearted
Commercial like pop, or underground like black markets
Where were you the day hip-hop died?
Is it too early to mourn? Is it too late to ride?

Kwa is chillin', Tone is chillin'
What more can I say, we stay building
And make killings
Take children through the wilderness, by the hand
It's a great feeling, show 'em how to be a man
Exactly, pack trees in my khakis
My sound fat like a Neve while you thin like a Mackie
C'mon, shine so bright when I walk by
You got ta squint like the motherfucking sun in your eye
What! Say somethin, you stay frontin
It ain't nothing, let off like I'm big game hunting
Me and Tek stay way blunted
Wave running on beaches with white sand
With a slight tan
Smack the mic stand with my right hand
When I'm excited
Leave you so far in the dust that you forced to bite it
On fire like property lost to riots
Yo, ain't no stopping us when we all united

Kwes.,"She could be my little freckled-face fidgeter, me but miniature
Sleeping on the sofa 'till she tackles and I tickle her, the whisperer
I could be your listener, telling me your stories
But I'm showing her a signature, the scribbler
Saying that she's finished but I tell her eat her spinach
And she'll see the sky's the limit, trust
'Cause when we're with it I can feel there ain't no limit
Just be free, me and my sister, I can see the skies are limitless
I feel her brush her hand across my cheek 'til I speak
I yawn and say good morning, keep her sweet, squeeze her deep
'Til she giggles, starts to wriggle in the sheet
Then she disappears and sweeps me off my feet
I need to eat, uh, I'm reminded of the handshakes
Remember that I promised her some pancakes
So I stagger to the stove and start to stand braze
See I make 'em like my nan makes

I see you perching on the corner of the weeping window pane
You're growing up fast just like the flora
The world is yours, come shine or rain

Uh, uh, I could be your freckled-face figure, her but bigger
Shelter her from school when all the snitches start to snicker
I'll be sticking with her, hold her close and deeper within her
She would better me reading the recipe while cooking dinner
My little sinner wander walking in the park
Put her to bed and end up talking 'til it's dark
She spins a web and I get caught up in the laugh
I should go but though I know I shouldn't ask
See, my sister's like, ""nah, there's one more task""
I ain't bored of one, laying with her 'til the morning come
More begun, I'm a warm her like the morning sun
Good morning, Ben, again, we talk until the morning's done
And I'm reminded of the handshakes
Remember that I promised her some pancakes
So I stagger to the stove and start to stand braze
See I make 'em like my nan makes

I see you perching on the corner of the weeping window pane
You're growing up fast just like the flora
The world is yours, come shine or rain

Yeah I hear them every day
I ain't heard a V.I.M. commercial in like two years, God
Yo, where you been
Brought back mad memories of when I used to be
Running up in there buying Lee's, Levi's, Adidas', yo
Man, so
Yo, I met my baby moms in V.I.M. kid
Nigga shut up, you stupid
Yo, that's my word
Back in the days I think it was like eighty-five, eighty-six, I don't remember
I was up in there... yo

This got me tripping, God
And you see how cute she is so you can't be trying to front
Yeah, she is fly
Yo let me tell you how the whole story went down kid
Peep this yo

I met my baby at the...	""V - I - M""

Now way way back, when when her, him and them
Couldn't spend loot on Guess and Timb's
We got fresh for less at V.I.M.
Shell top Adidas, Aptiva Kangol's and Lee jeans
No in betweens, you either had 'em or was wack, know what I mean
And V.I.M. was the spot to get 'em, one day my homey
Hit the Avenue shopping, and I bounced up there widd'em
The Ave was full of fly girls, but I wasn't on the hunt
All I wanted was my Puma's and a gold front
Stunts was running back and forth in V.I.M.'s, looking for someone to help
But I was like, ""No thanks skeezer, I'll get my stuff myself""
I was in the sneaker section, peeping out a pair of Nike's
When a sweet pretty voice asked, ""What size would you like""
I looked up and yo, I met these lovely brown eyes
Attached to an in place face, and body that can make your nature rise
Jocked honey for a bit, then said, ""A size six miss""
She smiled and walked away, yo kid, I got to get this

I met my baby at the... ""V - I - M""
While buying some sneakers, we fell in love
I met my baby at the... ""V - I - M""
While buying some sneakers, we fell in love

She came back to the spot, with a green Puma box
Took off my kicks and stared in shock at the FAT hole in my sock
Damn, the worst that could happen happened, I felt like breaking North
When honey burst out and started laughing
Thought about then realized yo, it was kind of funny
As I laughed and put my shoe she asked, ""That's all you want money?""
I was tempted to say, ""Um, can I have your number too?""
But I didn't want to play myself cause yo, that's not too cool
""Could you show me a pair of Lee's to match these, size 29?
And um, would you mind going with me to Mickey D's?""
Now where did that come from? Damn, I went out like a herb
But when she said yes to both questions, I was like, ""Oh word?!""
She paid for my stuff, plus got me a discount
Went to lunch and after that, saw each other a mad amount
It's ninety-four, but V.I.M.'s is my store for life
Not only did they help me get dipped, they helped me get a wife

I met my baby at the.. ""Vee Eye Emm!""
While buying some sneakers, we felll in love!

I wake up and chase my dreams
I won't regret when the sun sets
Cause I live my life like I'm a beast
I'm a mothafucking beast

Ayo back to make you run around the game like its a fire
I spit acid bitch like I got cyanide in my saliva
Watch me wet and heat shit up like I'm a washer and a dryer
While I beat you in your head until you tire
(I'm a motherfucking beast)
See the way we got my niggas is open
I'm doing it again [?]
Got a nigga wilding like he in a bull pen
Look at me wishing holiday hopin'
Go down with the menace and I stop and I won't finish
But I'll drop and I put skill in it, hotter than a skillet
Pinkie fuck them with the guard, the gun is at your head
Every single time you niggas see me, step beside the door
Killing everything with a thousand gorillas, my homi's so
I suggest you bow to let your chick eat my salami slow
Cry like a [?] niggas in the hood with that tsunami flow
Get back homie before you get snapped
Even got a bitch strapped in the club with a snub nose
While I make them black with a banging and then crack
Niggas in the head and back, everybody, 'til the club close
Haters I see you sitting over there
That's why you see me blacking everywhere

Homie welcome to the east side, where killers reside
We playing war games, please hide
Ain't no signs of peace, so fuck a peace sign we ride
Bust shots from a car seat
My nigga hang you 'til your neck is broke
Choke with you with a Stethoscope
That's how I kill a motherfucker in a heartbeat on a dark street
(I'm a motherfucking beast)
I'm a motherfucking beast right
Keep it three, Five, Seven, in a Levis
When the beam fries, house game could be used as the disguise
Look in these eyes, blast, then you gonna see when the heat fly
Yo, is it we dumb or is it the city we from
Got us killing each other over these bread crumbs
You fuck with me it's gonna be [?] Area 1-51
This murder rap is red rum
I done seen that nigga help you with a pistol
Pull a gunmen out the window of a rental situation, detrimental
Little kids are getting caught up in the middle, and they killed, it's accidental
That's why I'm keeping a pistol, matter of fact capture my enemy
Kidnap or slap him in the back of the Infinity
Bandanas to mask the identity, start scratching like Charles Manson
Or [?], fight back, attack me with energy, fight back will add to your injury
When I write raps you have to have a Bachelors in Chemistry
Or a Masters in Math to be in the actual vicinity
To pass me up mentally, to match my agility
From Aspen to Italy, I have the ability to send your ass to the trinity
Like death when it's after the Kennedy's

But they don't know how the IRS hung me
What do you do when they take all of your money
Get gram like gumby come back like a bungee
All of my grief it is making me unleash
On a bum all my opponents will cease
So I'm yelling to the north, and the south, and the west and the east
I'm motherfukin' beast
When you don't have nothing
Only have the way that you go its still mad tough
And the crowd stuff, the lab book, and notes with the bad luck
And the flash up with the cash stuffed up in the bag
And you gotta get it no matter what
Don't give that money to put enough in your gut
I gotta be the killer because I'ma stunt [?] leave us in the dust
The ruthless, killed my mother
Something really stupid, feel my brothers
And I'm beginning to treat my ill like others
With real life smothers, I feel like thuggers
So bang, try to my way up in the gang, with the pain I write this
I came to ice ya, a ring to nice ya
She hanging knifeless, I'm stranger, hey bitch I aim when I spit
For the winning I'm gonna increase
The pressure when I'm having no peace, feel me
Because I gotta eat, I won't let the demons release, kill me
Son of a feast your gonna need a bishop of the priest
I am that monster coming to get you to say the least

If it's war that they want we already are registered
The king, it is he, who defends me
So when it's time for the showdown 
We'll march in the soldiers Babylon, get throwed down

[Verse One (Kymani Marley):]
Yo,
Oh,
At first glance its like cupid hit,
Mesmorised by her thighs and her hips.
So, she went ahead and find a man wit' some chips,
And left school when she cop da whip.
Caught in the game,
Locked in the speedin' lane.
Livin a life for money, drugs and fame,
But true love is what she can't entertain.
And every chance she get she's given the blame.
Then she askin' why,
I told she was livin a lie.
When I told her she started to cry.
Don't just sit and let life pass you by,
And I slowly wiped the tears from her eyes.
[Chorus:]
I told her to take it slow,
Girl give it time to flow,
And from a seed to a flower you'll grow.
So many seeds on the street,
No sunshine but always heat.
And lives are lost at every heartbeat. 
I told her take it slow,
Girl give it time to flow,
And from a seed to a flower you'll grow.
So many seeds on the street,
No sunshine but always heat.
Drownin' in poverty and deceit,
But black roses grow from concrete.
[Verse Two (Ms Dynamite):]
He got a family to feed,
So every night he out on the street,
Shottin poison to young mothers and youths dem,
Coz he feel it the only way to keep his peeps on they feet,
Makes ends meet,
And gets his own up out of poverty.
Until one night,
He came home to find his mother cry,
she pointed to the floor and he saw a trail of his supply,
She led him to his room to find his brother on his bed,
Track marks, 
Needle in his arm and stone cold dead.
And suddenly, 
They all flashed before his eyes,
The kids that he sold to,
And they mothers cries. 
Every child is someones child 
You affa a mind what you do,
'cause Karma gunna bring the drama back on you.
Do what you gotta do,
But nigga when it comes to them youths,
There is no excuse,
Our future that,
We supposed to nurture that,
Nah lettin nuttin or nobody hurt that.
Do what you gotta do,
But nigga when it comes to them youths,
There is no excuse,

On the corner at the end of the block

Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you 
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on

But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun
Didn't know that you 
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you

Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
'Cause we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star

Drop to your knees and hold your head to the sky
Say a prayer for the lord soldier that you need to fly

Dear lord the hour is upon us
As we engage in battle be merciful upon our souls
Grant us the strength so we may overcome the danger

I heard it in your inflection
He's your favorite selection
Of my records collection
So let it spin so don't stop or let it go
Just wanna know if you'll stay with me

Your Diesel tees, a watch that could blind

Have two of the baddest bitches up in each hurr
There's fur in the atmosphere, of course he's nurr
Like my nigga Trell said I'm fresher than John Durr
But back to the basics
Bows with the straps
I'm done with the daytons
I'm going with the flaps

Red and white fitted with the red and white kicks
Leave out of town with an STL bitch
Just to let you know I'm on some STL shit, bitch

'Cause we keep that thang on our muh'fuckin hip
It's a Midwest thang

I sport my beeper on my boots, that's why I be a buzz when I kick
Maybe it's on my lips, it's chaos when I spit
Quarter man, quarter schoolboy, half Lunatic
Quarter rubber, quarter dick, other half in yo' chick
Keep a quarter of some sheeeiit, I'm the Pooky of the backyard
All colors and all types like a junkyard
Hot young boy with hot young ways
'Cause I connect three blunts and be high for three days
You can tell by the way I walk I ain't from 'round hurr 
Probably couldn't tell 'cause I ain't walkin' nowhere 
I got a old-school Cutlass, with a hole in the air
TV's everywhere wood grain to steer (stare)
I don't care, hell naw I ain't cuttin' my hair
Ten and a half in them Airforce 1's, gimme two pair ugh
I'm from the Lou' and what I do is a Lou' thang
One rapper, two rings and three chains

Me and Murph' some ole country boys that ride V-12 horses
Saddle up and put spurs on my Airforce's
Back porches made for hide and go seek
We got space out hurr, we can ride and chief
Ain't gotta worry 'bout nobody approachin' us
By the time they catchin' up, we smoked it up
And my eyes be red, my lips a lil' dark
The Lou is more than the Rams, Cards and lil' Arch
My dirty's love to spark, and love to sparkle
Love, on me Vokal coats with matchin' cargo
We racin' down Skinker, see how fast our car go
Granny be like ""Ay-yi-yi"" like Ricky Ricardo
I know you wanna know why we do what we do
You cats ain't got a clue why the Cutlass blue
Brand new twenty-two's on new UV's
With one, two, three, four, five TV's

It's a Midwest thang, y'all and they ain't got a clue (they ain't got a clue)
Why my Cutlass blue
And I got them thangs on that muh'fucker too
It's a Midwest swang, y'all and they ain't gotta trip (they ain't gotta trip)
While we swing and dip
'Cause we keep that thang on our muh'fuckin hip
It's a Midwest thang

I'm sittin' on the front porch, writin' a hood rhyme
Waitin' on my connect to deliver that good line
Wish I would find, one seed in my weed
Sticks and shit, if I do somebody bleed
Pull right here, eight pounds of Chinamen
Two stay hittin' some blunts and Heineken
Hidin' in the back was the popos
Kicked in my do'do', man they some ho ho's
They put the gun to my ear, you know the Lord don't fear
Nann nigga, nann ho, let's keep that bullshit clear
They had me face down in the skreet
Errbody watchin', thinkin' I'ma pull the heat
And leave the D-tects with a leak in the skreet
And that, pussy ass nigga that set me up my peeps
Gon' give it to this nigga like NYPD
Beat the case, fuck coke, now I'm back on my granny porch hustlin'

It's a Midwest thang, y'all and they ain't got a clue (they ain't got a clue)
Why my Cutlass blue
And I got them thangs on that muh'fucker too
It's a Midwest swang, y'all and they ain't gotta trip (they ain't gotta trip)
While we swing and dip
'Cause we keep that thang on our muh'fuckin hip
It's a Midwest thang y'all

Swallowin Cris' 'til we spit up, put your shit up cause now
We navigatin, wood grain, hood slang, collaboratin
God over satan, no debatin, so I'm celebratin
This new life, off the block buyin stock
Divin off the dock in Bangkok, I used to slang rock
And it was so hard, but now the wallet sport a gold card
Bitches goin nuts when the rims hit the boulevard
Hustle hard, the whole inside glowin
From the T.V.s, diamonds went from hard to see to 3-d
Double VD, bubble Lex with the CD
Puffin seaweed, I'm free, hit the slope and ski
DC to France, finance is too advanced
Wit' plans to cause a trance, money stands yellin ""romance!""
I never stop comin, gunnin, runnin and sunnin
With Cuda spinnin them hun'neds on hun'neds spinnin and blunted

I'm like okay, niggas brought they cars out
Thick broads out, all the stars out
We ain't been here two minutes, mami already yellin
""What a nigga gon' do with it, can we hop in the Infinite?""

Five deep in a Yuko', we struggle by toes, we still ghetto
Float St. Louis, fake insurance, with no petro
Nuts are heavy, Teddy Peddy tell 'em to let go
'Tics are ready, Kevin Law tell 'em I said so
I let go, sixteen out of sixty-four
And the forty-eight bars left'll have you keekin for mo'
Women be like ""who do y'all think y'all are?""
I'm Mr. pull up in big trucks, I'm far from a star
Cause I'm the sun, the reason why the day gon' come
One out of five reasons why they hatin on us
Tracks is like a gas tank, I fill 'em on up
And my shows is robbery style, they givin it up
I'm like a Michael Jackson concert, a milli' and up
And these haters are like a comedy, be buggin me up
They women treat me like cows, they be pullin my stuff
And to get that up outta me more, they be suckin me off

Now you know Mo, I stay equipped with a zip
And the soles of my Air Force One's on e'ry trip
And on e'ry whip I choose those D's to roll
(What them niggas 'round the corner gon' start shit for?)
When they know, oh, he keep a stash in the Nav'
Pop a half and take out your Ave. on my behalf
My whole staff love to laugh and count the money
On the couch, hands in our pants like Al Bundy
I love smoke ganjä, Monday to Monday
And e'ry other day a nigga fuckin with gun play
It's ok, since all the dogs out
All my broads out, doin they bought the bar out
And we rollin, Henny holdin and blunt rollin
Money foldin, been in more rings than Hulk Hogan
It's official, Nelly Hummer clean as a whistle
You boys signed to Fo' Reel, you doin your thug thizzle

For sure, we gon' hold that down for St. Louis no doubt
My nigga Kyjuan gon' kick this shit out right here
We the Lunatics, no doubt
They wildin, they don't know

Ay yo
St. Louis is small but we still do it all
We hit the mall, we drink it all, we always gon' smoke it all
Get hit, we shake it off, at the club yellin ""take it off""
My success is takin off, I'm always workin, never takin off
I done that, did that, who her? I done hit that
Cats be trippin off them rats, I ain't really with that
Makes me wanna sit back, I relax and think back
To when I used to click-clack, makes me angry when I flash back
Mo, you should get back, I mean this, hang with the meanest
Remain the cleanest, always smoke the seedless greenest
You've seen this like reruns, pop-a-lock like reruns
St. Louis where we from, you ain't never heard a weak one

You got to stand up and get it together, roll with the punches, whatever
Get in our way, destroy ya, make you wish you had never, ever
Fucked with the real crazy, pyscho sick move the lady
Sunnin so nut and shady, kid pass me the three-eighty
By my sack, cock and load it, your world I'm a rock and roll it
My business, you shouldn't a told it, to end I'm a forty-four
They switch guns and they go for show it, your pupils is dilating
This rap is so beautiful watch The Source give it higher ratings
The 'tics just can't be faded, to nothin that's star related
More than just duplicated, Kenjuana's to celebrated
Got damnit we finally made it, haters they gotta hate it
Bought my house off and finally paid it, often intoxicated
Just call me the Don-dotta, original rider, rider
Your mama just gotta, gotta, take her home and here ""splatter, splatter""
Splatter, splatter, I'm from St. Louie

S-T-L is where we stay, in the middle, no coast
Lyrics boastin with flight, what up Mo, I'm just your neighbor, what up
St. Louis' finest, just keep a cover like Linus
Stop your ass up like sinus, congest ya 'til you learn your lesson, we blessin

Now you can find Murphy in a Jag, on a commercial
But at home in St. Louis, yo I's are walkin' like Herschell
I be like (oh, oh, oh)
Wit' a pocket full of bus tickets, lookin at booties thinkin I must hit it
Why must I live like that, what you expect?
Young dude done paid bills with them advancement checks
Honeys screamin they want more than sex, I'm like ""why me?""
Find out it don't even take that Lex to like me
I be the young dude, Mr. drop a top a bubble Benny whipper
(What else nigga?)
A weed head slash Henny sipper
No I'm not ballin
I'm tryna' get it how I live and how I live is how I get that shit
I'm like nine-nine-nine-na-nine-nine-na-nine short of a mil ticket!
(Chachi'll take it) and say that Bill did it
But I'm a be real for real and deal wit' it
And get mine in the summertime like Will did

What you thought I was gonna do, bitch and scream, fuck my dreams?
Walk off the team like Rodman?
Move the scene, nigga what you mean, not now playa I'm swabbin
I put four silver dollars up on a white castle out in Cochran
Get them things out and cock 'em, anything bubble I'm poppin
Anything stumble, I'm droppin, whatever you rollin, I'm toppin
If it's fully loaded, I'm coppin, wheww
No more slanging rocks, I rock rocks, you duck cops, I cop drops
You buy cock, I buy stock, touch mine, you are not
I'm Rocafella with hard knocks, dome shots 'til I get popped
Used to ball on the blacktop now I balls on hardwood
With enough finance stability to finance a small hood
Call it Nellyville nigga, and guess who the mayor
My whole towns chronic'd out so we drug aware
I'm playin truth or dare with dime pieces, and they nieces
Showin me there's more than one way that they can eat a Reeses
Can I repeat this, man, you niggas need to see this

See I ain't about playin, Leezy 'bout cash in advance
Cash in on the casual, actual, factual plan
Makin a killin man, went from that to makin a livin
Rightous willin, the only thing supreme swimmin
And proceed, to not smoke weed around the seed
It's the new way, new life, peace true indeed, off T's
I dwell on off how y'all plan makin mo' money, so I had to buy a fly chain
Ran in this game, dirt broke, now it's MTV with Kurt Lod'
With the Q-four-feezy, be hurtin folks
Keep the bird toast, black handle, horoscope hood scandle
You the type of niggas puffin in shirts, socks and sandels
Keep the God in me, the Hova Ja knew Allah in me
Ball wit' me, don't tell 'em who saw when 'bout to squall wit' me
Fall wit' me, this pure mic dope I'm sellin
It's the man with mellow rap, felon, constantly yellin ""yo ma!""

Uh, uh, uh, uh
What's it like bein Nelly, ay, let me break it down
It's like a shootout and you the only nigga wit' rounds
It's like a weed drought and you the only nigga wit' pounds
It's like a Freaknik and you got the only brothers in town
I'm like a shoe-in, for the poster boy, the thug of the year
GQ style ma', let me put a bug in your err (ear)
Go tell ya man, he take a step, there went a slug in his err (ear)
Have 'em askin (yo, how the hell he get a gun up in here?)
(That's gotta be illegal, Bob!)
I can bring them chrome things for that drastic shit
Metal detectors, no problem, got that plastic shit
Witnessess, ""I ain't seen 'em, they had masks and shit""
""Whoever it was, was in a rush 'cause they was fast and quick""
Oh, I'm just a playa, mo', these ain't my rules

I'm like the heir to the throne
Me and my niggas fastbreak through your home, get ya coach on the phone

Show 'em what they won, Alize, Mo', Crissy or ale, Bob

Show 'em what they won, niggas talkin shit get served, Bob

See I'm a Ruger shooter, don't make me have to do ya
Boo-ya, you see what Lunatics'll do to ya
Tip-??? pursuer, get 'er in a room and do 'er
First cat out the Lou that you knew that
Wore a lime-green headband, matchin leather pants
Vokal t-shirt with some sparklin wristbands
This man, he keeps it real sweet
With somethin sweeter than sweet, puffin on Swisher Sweets
I'm unique, like a blue??? bird without the beak
I'm deep, like bucket seats when the 'tics hit the streets
Pick door number three if your price is right
I'll pull a DJ Quik ""tonite is the night""

Hold on, so I can tell 'em who I is, a young school boy with one kid
I think I'm five-eight, but yo, maybe I'm five-six
With my boots off, I prefer my booties in boots off
You get in my bed, you better take pants, shoes off
Now, and not right now but right now!
And I ain't backin down, she can get up and bounce
The Young Dude, quick to roll up an ounce and head south
Don't even have drive, I can sit on the couch
And wrap somethin, and put on a beat and rap somethin
They call me Mr. get all mad and smack somethin
I'm wild dude, you could probably find me on side two
If not I'm a holla like Ja Rule, get a dollar from my boo
And go and by a juice or somethin
A virgin rapper, I ain't gettin loose for nothin
Money earnin rapper, I ain't got no boots for nothin
So I'm servin rappers, I be cookin when I'm comin

I'm rolling with the top off, see tops come off
When the streetlights go off I heard shots go off
I'm a humble show-off I'll be beating when I roll off
Pumping Jill Scott number seven in front of the seven-eleven
Grab some magnum protection gonna be some sexin'
Wrap some hemp and L's its gonna be a session
She stressing the fact that we gotta stay at the best western
I ain't cheap and that's on everything 
Put her pants to her knees don't take off everything
I pay for her chains staying near her cain's 
Sipping on her cane I'm forgetting everything

Boy she wouldn't have been with me if you wouldn't have left her
I left her sexed her stressed her and left her

Stir it up like mother fuckin coffee then back to the middle
Lift over some pounds some way my hitters nod away

Oh we fuckin now pumping like all my pow
Ass up face down I'm going to town
Round and round here I go pumping for nothing
Cus she wiggle and wiggle and wiggle just know when I'm coming
I'm like *Ohhhh* I can't take it no more
Move it one more time and watch my knees buckle
She tip drip type quit to get her dirty, hype, and aroused
Always see her nipples through her blouse *Owwww* 
Watch it wiggle just like the Harlem dance
Look at all that ass in those *itty-bitty* pants
Damn, hey Ms. Parker I make that ass come on down like Bob Barker

[Verse 3: Nelly]
Baby girl shake it like a paraplegic please believe it (Wooo)
Knees bent, and back arched just how I need it
Call her ""Billie Jean,"" I like the ""Thriller"" before I ""Beat It""
Conceded when she shake it but I like it like that
Throw it at me even harder just to see me react
See if it's wack, in fact see what Nelly about
I thought that ass was a fluke until I went to her house
You see mama got ass too, her sister Keesha and Sue
Her cousins, aunts and nieces start walking in by two
Like who's trying to keep they composure now
I'm feeling it can't nobody hold me down
Nobody told me how crazy groupies and coochies can get
In the back side under the stage trying to hit
And I'm like ""Baby girl I ain't that kind of guy""
Let me at least let me go get a condom I ain't trying to die
I might be high but I'm not that damn high!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Ali]
Oh lord my dick hard call the nurse (why?)
It's getting worse fat asses I gotta flirt
It was me Mo and Murph, Kyjuan was with his earth
Playing pussy it hurt, smoking, passing the smirks
Popping bottle after bottle I'm like ""Here we go again""
Posting it up in the club thinking ""Is he got a win""
My chrome shoes went from Barry to Larry Hughes
Emmitt's 22's now its Jordan's I cruise
But anyway Fo Sho I'm from the show me let me show you
To drunk and out of town trying to kiss you like I know you
In the middle of the dance floor caught the man's attention
Wiggle Wiggle do your thug's hydraulic suspension
Did I mention long Ohhh, ""What the fuck is going on?""
Your body banging ma' I got to take you home
Cool lets break, to the house on the lake
Man this is great I'm dealing with high stakes

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

Yo, know what I'm feelin'?

I'm comin' back down baby
This time in the six fo'
A lil' mo' sho', listen to the switches go
Zoop, zoop, zoop zoop zoop
Zoop, zoop, zoop zoop zoop

I'm comin' back down baby
This time in the six fo'
A lil' mo' doe, listen to the switches go
Zoop, zoop, zoop zoop zoop
Zoop, zoop, zoop zoop zoop

You can find me, same city, same state
Carryin' more weight, fishin' wit more bait
More license plates than your DMV
Takin' more total request than your MTV
Every, gaga, they call me Dada
The rookie want to signin' bonus for that pu nada
But my, salary cap won't allow me to give a nada
I guess she be a free agent until she find another
Call it fresh, for the D's on my ATVs
And if I squeeze niggas fallin' like they last name Keys
Dirties please, watch me as I switch my steez
First name GMC, last name Denali
Why the change? Yu-kon not fuck wit me
Eight batteries, four pumps where the trunk should be
I hear the conversations, about Nelly he overrated
I'm feelin' like Chris, slightly a little violated

Now what you lease I pay cash for, lit up like the dashboard
Went from the PJ's to livin' out past Ford
What the cash for? Me to spend
Like the rims on the Benz while you pretend nigga I fuck twins
From the back end back to the club and backed in
Went to the back end gotta announce we back in
The place where my crew go
Iced out Jesus face and Parasucco
Bread sick I need your Pluto
Black Menudo, in the candy black two-door
Bmw Sport, check the Ra Report
What you thought it was a widle? Yea, them seats swivel
Cats be killin' me talkin' ballin' and can't dribble
Bits in the Kibble, ménage trois was civil
Crystal y'all, head from all, 18 ta' 80 bar
Hit the mall nigga, and shop 'till we fall
And the bitches y'all be lovin' won't even bother to call

I'm comin' back down baby

I'm comin' down down, baby, duck when you see me
When Kyjuan comin' the spray, yo it ain't graffiti
No I don't eat bullets, but I'll feed the needy
Throw up a L, but I won't smoke a L at the city
Truck is big, tires is meaty, yes indeedy
Excursion, lime-green so I know that you'll see me
Ky-Weeze done brought them cars out
No doubt, like numba' 3 on Free City CD
It's not a game, I went from a GS to a LS
And LS don't mean low self-esteem
So clean, cats think I sip Ajax suit Vokal
Nights mis-match, hard from Zat
I smoke herb, but what's the harm in that?
Hey Mr. Officer, where Clarence Harmen at?
Only got caught once, where my warnin' at?
Been in St. Louis all my life, ain't seen a farmer yet

(Back in 1993) Was when a school boy decided to be an MC
(See some said no, others said fa' sho)
And now we comin' back down, this time in a six fo'
Zoop zoop, open ya mind up for this lineup
No, we don't pitch but rich is how we wind up
Situations, entrepreneurs get dollars and new toys
(Wait 'till they get a load of my Impala!)
We back back, matter fact goin' down down
You people need to calm down, Spreewells only goin' round
Actin' like you neva' seen a car dance befo'
They be askin' how does it feel like D' Angelo (how does it feel)
Picture wakin' up, all weed, bomb weed
Palm trees, no kickin' it on the beach
Have to work all day, dirty, 3 P.M. To 3
But at your local ATM you can find Murphy Lee

I'm comin' back down baby
This time in the six fo'
A lil' mo' doe, listen to the switches go
Zoop, zoop, zoop zoop zoop
Zoop, zoop, zoop zoop zoop

I'm comin' back down baby
