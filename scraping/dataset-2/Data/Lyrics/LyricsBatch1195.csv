Thug Life,"It was a dope spot front yard, one on one strappin'
That's the way it was way before all the scrappin'
Earned my fuckin' props from the G's in the hood
Put in work, did some dirt, never snitched, never would
Rollin the fat Jaguars with my nigga P blowin' up
Time comin' back sippin Henessey
Seventeen years old and I felt like God mad rich
And I had my pick of any fine bitch
And my family was known to be great, seen slightly more
Representin' no matter who sets it on
Street power, why you niggas flip and you thug shit
I be bout my motherfuckin' grip, nothin' else
Gets between me and mine, just remember that
Damn it's a shame, but still I'm in the game
I'm tryin to get street fame

""I'm a superstar, I'm a superstar""
""I'm a superstar, made it by street fame""
""I'm a superstar, I'm a superstar""
""I'm a superstar, made it by street fame""

Don't blame my mama, don't blame my daddy
I know they wish they never had me
In and out of jail by twelve, failin' out of school
'Cause I was livin' by the street rules
Hangin' with hogs, droppin' dawgs as a little loc
I was gettin my respect but I was still broke
Into the game and expanded to the cocaine
Went from double-ups, to slangin' them whole thangs
Focused on my mail name ringin' like a bell
And even with no proof they gonna put me in jail
Ever'body says he's sold and I'm outta control
Motherfuckers gossip but I still roll (nigga)
Bitches want my cash on my dash of my cockpit
They wouldn't know a motherfucker if he didn't have shit
So while I'm ballin' and kickin' up dust, get yo' skull crushed
Bitch-made niggas know not to fuck with us
Cause I'm livin' on the edge, I'm blastin' lead
Wanted by the Feds, they got to take me dead
So fuck it drive a bucket in the inner city
In the land of no pity, I made it by the street fame

""I'm a superstar, I'm a superstar""
""I'm a superstar, made it by street fame""
""I'm a superstar, I'm a superstar""
""I'm a superstar, made it by street fame""

""I'm a superstar, I'm a superstar""
""I'm a superstar, made it by street fame""
""I'm a superstar, I'm a superstar""
""I'm a superstar, made it by street fame""

I'm a super star, made it by street fame
I had to make some people feel the pain, in this dirty game
I know I'm on my way to hell
Ain't no yellow bricked road for all the niggas that I done smoked
The hood done took me under, a nigga gots no heart
Don't get it twisted cause I'm there with my homey's car
I kill for my niggas, my niggas kill for me
That's the love you get, from the drunk one, you put in work see
I'm a G with a gang of niggas after
Tryin' to peal me, cause I smoked they homey
What comes around goes around is what makes it worse
I smoke blunts all day to keep my mind off a hearse
They don't stop stop til my casket drop drop
Let me ride, but all I want, thou shalt not beef or die
And it don't matter if I rap or plays
Cause I blow out back of some minds, fuck the fame

""I'm a superstar, I'm a superstar""
""I'm a superstar, made it by street fame""
""I'm a superstar, I'm a superstar""
""I'm a superstar, made it by street fame""

Thug Life,"Ha ha, under pressure, yeah, bay-bay!
The pressure's on, Thug Life
When it's on, it's on

One of these days I'll, learn, don't fuck with trick-ass niggas
Cause they, turn, into bitch-ass niggas
I'm sick of bein' stuck in the county jail
My niggas clown, bring a pound when they postin' bail
Smokin' blunts in the driveway, my fo'-five
Screamin', ""Fuck the police!"" when we fly away, thug 'til I die
You wonder why I'm made this way
I wasn't, turned out, I was raised this way
I'm thinkin' these, are the dreams of a young teen
Scheme, to stack cream off of crack fiends
One-time can't hold me
One of these days, we gotta bust back for the homies
Locked down in the penitentiary
I'll, probably lose my mind if the pig sentence me
I'm, stressed, smokin weed, and nicotine
But what a nigga really need, is Thorazine
Right before I die I'll be cursin the law
Reincarnated bitch, even worse than befo'
My fo'-fo' screamin payback
My underhanded plan to get them niggas while they laid back
And Big Stretch hit the scene with the mini-14
Servin suckers like dope fiends, empty the whole thing
Under pressure nigga, haha, that's right!

Never run, throw your gun in the air, oh yeah!
Nigga bust ain't no time to spare
Cause the ruckus motherfucker and we fuck shit up
And with the stainless steel ribbon boy we cuttin' shit up
Flash then blast a nigga with the quickness
Cock the four pound motherfucker when I spit this and rip this
Damn, my mind is in the depths of hell
But when I'm walking on the street kid my name rings bells
And I never fell, nigga I stand too tall
I'm just a thug motherfucker who was born to brawl
Givin' my all, so niggas wanna bring it to me
So I'mma sell my cocaine, and lay they ass down G
Uhh, under pressure

Yeah, look here though

Runnin' wild, I never smiled as a juvenile
Even now I keep a frown when I come around
Don't ask me 'bout the past, it was all bad
Shots blasted, will I last in the wrong path
In the dark is where my heart saw the most grief
Motherfuckers is gettin' shanked over gold teeth
Am I sick, cause I'm addicted to gettin' splifted
Watchin' stupid-ass tricks get lifted
Nothing's changed, 'cause in the game it's a steady aim
Fuck friends cause in the danger them niggas change
Puff weed, and stuff G's in my sock G
Car keys and Hennessy, where the Glock be?
Time's passin', will I last here another day
I put my gun away, and grab my AK
It's gettin' hectic, I can't call it
House full of alcoholics, now a nigga's under pressure

Yeah, that's right
Under pressure nigga, a nigga's under pressure, yeah!

When the pressure's on, it's a hit
Ski mask, extra gats, bring the clips
Don't nobody move when we walk the streets

We live a Thug Life, Thugs for Life
Yeah (How long will they mourn me?) We handle this shit for you bwoy
Yeah nigga
2Pac in this motherfucker

All my homies drinkin' liquor
Tears in everybody's eyes
Niggas cried, to mourn a homie's homicide
But I can't cry, instead I'm just a shoulder
Damn, why they take another soldier?
I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
I'll get them suckers back before your buried (shit)
Retaliate and pull a one-eight-seven
Do real niggas get to go to heaven?
How long will they mourn me? Bury me a motherfuckin' G
Bitch don't wanna die, then, don't fuck with me
It's kinda hard to be optimistic
When your homie's lyin' dead on the pavement twisted
Y'all don't hear me doe, I'm tryin hard to make amends
But I'm losin' all my motherfuckin' friends, damn!
They should've shot me when I was born
Now I'm trapped in the motherfuckin' storm
How long will they mourn me?

I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me?

Every motherfuckin' day homie
You stayed down when the other niggas didn't know me
From my heart to the trigger you my fuckin' nigga
And things won't be the same without ya nigga
I remember kickin' back, you wanted a 'llac
And goin' half on a motherfuckin' hundred sack
Smokin' blunt after blunt, and steady drinkin'
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'
Tell me Lord, why you take big Kato?
So confused not knowing which way to go
I'm goin' crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time
I can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind
So day after day, ride after ride
We'll hook up on the other side
Watch over your family and your newborn
Till we meet again homie

Damn, a nigga tired of feelin' sad
I'm tired of puttin' in work
I'm tired of cryin' watchin' my homies leave the earth
I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt
And my peoples'll be mournin'
When they get a call from the coroner
All niggas can say is that's fucked up
And get tossed up, reminiscin' how we grew up (my nigga)
Rest and love to my nigga Kato
See you in the crossroads real soon
For now let me pour out some brew
I'll be always thinkin' of ya homie
Rest in peace, how long will they mourn me?

We know life's a fuckin' trip
And everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato?
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
It's enough to make you crazy, it's fuckin' with my dome

Since the day, of my motherfuckin' birth (uh)

Thugs known to bust on sight
God bless my crazy life la vida loca homie livin' that thug life
Been raised in violence homicide's my lullaby
Came with the homies and learned to kick it until we die
Boss players you wonder why
I live the life of a ghetto kingpin, just let me ride
Bitches and niggas in penitentary suits
I send 'em letters and money orders and make 'em my troops
As for you females, I got no time, I gotta get mine
You cannot blind me addicted to a life of crime
My time as shorty was full of car chases
While runnin' with John Gotti's and Scarface's
Niggas knew, I'd be the Don in my own crew
A million niggas with automatics who swarm through
You wonder who shot me here's a clue, stay alert
'Cause we comin' for you, and keep it money over bitches

M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

I blow you up on the spot, these glocks hot 'til you drop
All you wannabe cops, you don't want to see shots
I beef deep with the police peep what these streets do to me
Actin all new to me I creep on you like puberty
You don't want to see the bad image of this scrimmage
From here to East Greenwich through every state with a sentence
Frozen weight in the cooter, ten plates to soup ya
1 2's we oughta cruise right by the state troopers
When I'm drinkin Cristal, start thinkin' 'bout Al
Bacardi coverin my body at the wink and a smile
Bag a hottie or two, 'cause butter shotties for you
I got more bodies then Drew, I drink Mynotti on New, fuck your crew
This type of shit I do for a petty hobby
Fuck the world it's Fatal dog against everybody

M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

My shit's phenomenal, droppin' like domino
Comin' with the real yo and fuck what you feel yo
This is not for all the freaks in short skirts
This is for my niggas nationwide doin' work, get your feelings hurt
Lose mo' faith than a composure, money and the doja
Bitches is a cobra with deadly venom
Move as smooth as I get 'em, stackin G's
My niggas crosstown got ki's
Hoes get diseased and fleas, for these enemies money over bitches
(Nigga!)

M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

I'm hittin' sixteen switches, my money over bitches
The struggle continues I'll miss you on my road to riches
I'm contribed to strive never laggin
Disappear in the night with my 64 dragon, rag flaggin'
As I get 'em up and leave 'em stuck
Pager blowin up but I don't give a fuck
I'm fully stocked on the block, pockets full of rocks sellin''
Loc'ers and smokers engaged twenty-fo'/seven
So what can you do for me and what can I do for you
But stay true, and do the things that we do
Blinded evil-minded no option for my offspring
Reminded can't find it complications what the future brings
Losin' my mind why you sweatin' me all the time
I'm caught in a bind, quality time on my grind
Rather be lonely honey and dodge you like snitches
I'm 'bout my riches, money over bitches

M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

That's from the time a nigga close his eyes I'm hopin', I hope he awoken
Payin' my own that's tokin' chokin' off-a glocks smokin'
Money and power watch these bitches 'cause they skanless
Gettin' niggas fucked ''n' stuck from Timbuk' to Los Angeles
Ain't a nigga ruggeder than this grimy Heine' guzzler
Cowards better duck before my calibers start rubbin ya
Me and my troops play blocks in groups, runnin' in flocks
Deuce-deuce in my socks keepin' a watch out for cops
Gettin' kicked, I keep my mind on my riches
While uncontrolled schemes keep me choosin my money over all my bitches

One do dirt, the other do dishes
My one bitch is viscious, the other is a real ho
The one under my pillow will leave a nigga crippled
The one layin' on my chest kno' how to work the strip pole
The other, family come from a long line of pistols
Now nina is a nine, and her brother is a 12 Gauge
Her mother is a .25 I packed in the 12th grade
Her pops, a .45 Heckler & Koch
And her uncle is a .44 Glock, they make ya pop
Her grandma is a revolver, .357
Her grandpa, big Mack-11, send yo' ass to heaven

Desert Eagles, Ak's, TECs, and Smiff & Wessons

You like the best thing to happen to me
And you said if we hung together, wouldn't nuttin' happen to me
I ain't even want to come outside
You kept braggin' bout the sun, and how we can have fun outside
So we hopped in the ride, I got you on my side
And I'm feelin' the urgent moment like Bonnie & Clyde
You keep poppin' that gangsta shit
How you could pop any man, its a plan about stayin' ya chips
How anyone get in front of ya, holla
How anyone get in front of ya, keep dollas or don't bother the kid
It's a cold world, you put the heat in dis bitch
Your the reason that Bin Laden, ain't defeated dis bitch
So I'mma keep this bitch, get deep down in the streets with dis bitch
Leak wit dis bitch, sleep wit dis bitch
Eat wit dis bitch, creep on feet wit dis bitch
I'm in love with a snub, and it's bulletproof love

We close together like me any my daughter
A shotcaller, when it time to rob we both in tact wit the manslaughter
I never knew that we would become so close
You on the block wit a nigga, everytime I slang yae and post
And you can never leave me, you know I fucks you the best
And if a nigga trip, I know you puttin' four in his chest
Do let the smooth jay fool ya, nigga my bitch will do ya
And they got nicknames like Nina's,Ross,Tech's, & Rugers
I love mine, wit a nigga through hard times
And when I tried suicide you wouldn't let me die
Yeah it's all hood, that's why I keep you close
Everynight you sleep wit a nigga and rest yo' head on my pillow

What's up playas (What's happenin' out there?)
Thugstas, and hustlas?
(Yeah, yeah, it's all real, yeah)

And I want you to know (I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(Oh, you know it ain't easy
Yeah, you know it ain't easy)

I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game

I lived in darkness for years
And barely can see through the smoke
At the end of my rope from sellin' that dope
Been makin' them dumb-dums out of soap
And I hope to be a better man
Never did I understand what I had
My attitude mad, young and bad
Fila, Levis still sportin' the sag
Walkin' the streets, lightweight thinkin'
Plottin', worryin' my Mama to death
Want to go home, but somethin' won't let me
'Cause I know she got problems her chest
It's a struggle, a puzzle the pieces so scattered
We find 'em, take your time and put it together
Nigga, quit walkin' around like you're blinded
Put your mind on your money, thug
Don't worry about what you got
Open your eyes, and peep the plot
Say your prayers, achieve a lot
Nigga, don't stop 'til you drop
Somewhere in a box, locked and buried
Other than that, my nigga, just smile
And don't worry (don't worry)

And I want you to know (I want you know, yeah)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(You know it ain't easy, you know it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks

Bow my head, askin' the Lord for change
Since I started sellin' 'cane
Shit ain't been the same
Began to acknowledge my bang ways
Who can I blame?
Maybe my pain, dealin' with it by callin' it a phase
These are the last days
Carry no shame, everyday thangs
Went from sellin' cocaine to rockin' the stage
The otherside of the game
Where you're rich, my aim to fame
Strange tradin' places, you're dealin' with races
Just wouldn't it be fate
Runnin' with thug, me never replace this
The Lord, I'd like to thank you for my Mo Thug family
Sincerely yours, Thug Queen (Thug Queen)

I remember my first day out of prison
Y'all, it was just me and my cousin
Takin' a ride in his car
We just went puffin' and sippin' on brews
Trippin' up old trues
Layzie asked me, ""What you gonna do? What you gonna do?""
I said, ""I don't know. I'm gonna take it slow
So gimme a couple of days, and I will let you know.""
I had to collect my mind
Knowin' one day I'm gonna shine
Until that day, I will pray
And try to parlay with the struggle God done dealt me
I know that He'll help me
Through the stormy weather
Our families got together and stay strong
But you gotta keep your head up high
'Cause there ain't no reason
Why you got to let it down
Just look around, we platinum bound (bound, bound)

And I want you to know (I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(It ain't easy, you know, you know ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(I won't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain
(I won't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain to the otherside of the game

Everything I ever knew since the day I was born
Consisted strictly of some type of a hustle
While my Mama workin' nine-to-five
On some nights, I be sittin' home alone
'Cause she'd be workin' doubles to survive
Makin' ends meet the best way she knew how
Keepin' food up on the table
Teachin' me the ways of the world - pick your friends
Like you do your fruit
Keep your distance from the playa hater
Pray you never have to shoot
I remember also on somedays there'd be nothin'
In our refrigerator except for a box of baking soda
And empty jar of pickle juice
I often wonder why the Lord
Had to create me in a world, oh so, so cruel
It's dog eat dog, I don't know what else to do
Except for call on God
Put my trust in You
No more, we're warriors.

I remember I went to school
With only about three pairs of pants, holes in my shoes
I guess I know what they mean by cold city blues
Ken bagged the stores
Tryin' to get money the best way I know how
How? Me and my brother up there
'Til hustlin' was no longer allowed
I know it's hard times
I'm learnin' this early to be a man
But since then, Ken Dawg flipped a whole new masterplan
Damn, don't nobody understand, but my family
But look at us now: the plan was to create jams
Ken Dawg, do or die, Mo Thug all the way to my dirt
I know it hurt the way we put in work
Can't do nothin', but ride with it, 'til it's over
From Novas to Range Rovers, we're still soldiers

You see a fellow like me
Done had it through all the wicked madness
Everyday I gotta fight this demon
Sadness take over my world of gladness
Then they want to ask me,
""Why do we all stay so high, fiendin'?""
Come kick it the way we roll
That's if you can handle it, baby
Without you tryin' to hate me, never
No more, so fuck 'em, look at this hate
Now stroll and get on my hustle
To keep my pockets swoll for sure
I collect more of those
Still we prefer takin' bills that fold
To hoes, me and my trues decided
To plot you for your dues
Come through with the battle
Ran through your house
And robbed the people next door
Moved out neighborhood
Now, who would you blame it on?
The ghetto?
Why this old crooked system set up to mess us up
But we come up and never fade the soldiers' ghetto

And I want you to know (ooh, I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks (just ask my folks)
And I won't blame it on the rain
(We can't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain (oh, no, yeah)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game.

Stormy weather tossin' my boat to and fro
Often to the point of shatterin' senses
I don't know which way to go
Somethin' inside persistin' me to move on
Just maintain, hold on, but my son, just keep it strong
Everything gon' be alright
Keep you're head to the sky
Just as long as you keep it real
And strive to reach the golden prize
Did what I had to do to make it this far
A lot of people got stuck
And I took enough battle scars
Took refuge worldwide to replenish my thought
I was not ready to accept them devilish clout
Drop to my knees, and began to do nothin' but pray
Gradually, life began to change
I'm in this Mo Thug game
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim

Would you forgive me, Lord
If I killed that man - that man
That tried to run up and rob me blindly
And leave me for dead was his intent?
But, Lord, I may be like that on the outside
Inside I'm one that's searchin' for peace
Right, as we ride deep
And seek holy scriptures, believe
Rollin', nobody knows what it is or who we approachin'
Just strollin', trustin' in the Lord (in the Lord)
As we struggle to make it each day, baby
You can believe that they keep gettin' harder with the time
With haters and evil
And sometimes it's even my people
And it feel like I'm losin' my mind
Fire, you need to burn this entire evil, evil empire

And I want you to know (to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(Through the rain, through the clouds
Through the thunderbolts)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(And we can't blame it on the rain, no)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain

I can make it through the pain

Through all our lives leads a path of destruction and death,
anger, pain seem to be the construction of society,
we call ourselves civilized,
our hands are covered in blood, we're cavemen in disguise !
How easy it would be to live cruelty free

I understood one day what this meat thing is all about
I ate it all my life,
I never had a doubt
My parents fed me pig, calve or poultry,
you have to eat it all up if one day you wanna be as big as me!
yes, I agree
We ate a whole lot of meat in our family,
but one day, 'round about 1984, it hit me like a rock,
I couldn't eat it no more!
Those screams from the slaughterhouse,
they woke me up real fast,
they turned my inside out
I realized my personal taste had a high price,
for every time I ate somebody had to die, but why?
I thought we're civilized...
our hands are covered in blood,
we're cavemen in disguise

How easy it would be to live cruelty free

But instead you mindlessly take their lives
Who gave you the right to play god himself as you decide about life
I don't fuckin' care 'bout how we used to be or how we had to hunt and collect,
'cause I don't get the point you see.
Hey, we don't live in the stone age anymore!
You keep the slaughterhouses, so you'll keep the war!
Don't you see the connection,
you just kill and destroy,
you're so fuckin' stupid,
'cause you seem to enjoy...
When they bleed, when they die,
when you fancifully fry...
The meat in your mouth is all that I see...
Just say what you like, but it's murder to me!",Cavemen in Disguise,1998
Thumb,"And if I never spoke a word again, but this I need to say.
I criticized and analyzed you
That's worthless from today on,
'cause I changed my attitude,
Forgive me father I was rude !
Man I think I made you feel no good
The victim of my moods !
I was such a teenage-little brat,
No appreciation for what you did...
That's how it seemed to you,
But I just needed you to take me in your arms keep me warm !
Forever you'll be to me, much more than I show you,
So much more than you see
Whenever we may disagree,
Its like losing a part that once belonged to me

In childhood-days I had to be much more of you, much less than me
I'd like to be just like my dad I swore,
You meant the world to me
But something changed my attitude,
I know myself if this is good or bad or anything to me oh father, let me be!
I was such a dumb-ass little kid,
No appreciation for what you did... that's how it seemed to you,
But I just needed you to take me in your arms keep me warm!

The further I'm away, the more I'd love to stay,
Cause I had to learn today, that now I love what I used to hate!
Wouldn't it be nice, if we both hadn't changed and parts of our lives could have been rearranged
Now it's got be too late to erase the past,
Think about the future, think about the past, think about it fast...
As long if we have each other... as long as we have each other...

People that can clearly see,
They're trying to be blind so they won't be a part of what I call reality,
Something deep inside of you and me,
Hidden somewhere back where you can't see,
You're so afraid that you can't set it free
I don't know what's so bad to be real,
I don't know why you're afraid to feel,
What you gotta lose it can't be much,
The only thing you seem to lose is touch

I can't believe...

There's a tendency to look away if something in our lives leads us astray,
You might have to find yourself today a different one than you were yesterday
How do thirst and hunger really feel,

It's all somewhere back where you can't see,
You're so afraid that you can't set it free

Everything we'll ever be has to die,
Everything we ever were is dead,

It could make me wanna turn around,
I don't wanna be lost and not found,
Everything that I lose, it just turns me upside down
Whatever I did on the way to becoming myself,
Here, today, all the skins that I shed like a snake have gone astray

I could pray I could try to be me, but I can't be me!

I remember me as a child,
Now my fantasies running wild,
Like a smell or a taste from the past,
This reminds me of me
Everything that I used to do,
I was so small, everything was new,
I never knew, what I'd grow up into
I remember the fear and the pain,
I remember the joy just the same,
I remember myself like a friend from days gone by
I could not be me, I could not feel me,
'Cause I realize I can't be just what I used to be
If I could only bring it back forever (3x)

I tried and tried to ease the pain,
But now I'm gone and I cannot come home again
Where's the little boy, that I used to be,
Of everything that I've lost I never wanted to lose me,
Use me up like a battery-pack,
I never wanted to leave,
But now I can't come back,

I wanna make it stay...

For everybody else to see it´s a joke,
Doesn´t it make you feel like you have to choke on the words you spoke,

You were looking mighty small to me,
Caught up in your world of misery.
Cause when you found a light to lead the way,
You were looking for a fire to lead you astray.
Out of your mind, you were looking for change,
You were going blind.
Say what you want, do what you want, be who you want to be !
You held your values so high, how could you sink so low. You try to reach for the
Sky, now you´ve got nowhere to go. You think it´s worth the pain, you say

It’s just a joke that we’re governed by a bunch of monkeys
Still I’m loving all the listeners, you matter to me
I got love for all the fishes in the Barrier Reef
A big-it-up for my fellow man, who gives a damn
If you’re black, white, or yellow man
Imma keep it mellow man
Ain’t about the melanin
And I believe in the phrase
“Stand for something or you might fall for anything”
So find me standing on my own two feet
Put my feet in your shoes, am I going to do?
You can walk a mile in my boots
I could do the same thing
And see how life is for you
That’s true and
Can you imagine a world without boarders?
I can imagine my girl with two daughters
What would you do to keep your family free?
Way I see: we’re apart of one family tree

I wanna say I’m one of the lucky ones
Jet setting just to tell them where I’m coming from
Few laps around the country but who’s counting
Got love for the city and love for the Blue Mountains
A change of scenery, to where I need to be
Meet the locals and sample the greenery
To me, everywhere I go is unique
Turn over a new leaf, feel the vibe on my frequency
I used to only ever see the negative
Always tripping out what I didn’t have
Now I realize what the lesson is
So I’m kicking back and giving thanks
All I need is one mic, one stage
A one night stand with your town
And the walk-of-shame down the runway
Means more than I can say
Till I make the hall of fame
It’s one love, one day

I must admit, I kind of suck at it but

Ye who came late and thank [?]
Much respect to the bugger man
Keep it on the humble and
Big love to the people in the struggle and
Trying to flee the motherland
And I don’t want to rub it in
But it’s fucked how you’re treated by my government
We seem to point the finger at the scapegoat
Even though we’re sinking in the same boat
While the cynic plays the victim with a halo
I pray to God you find a safe place home

I was only seventeen when I wrote my first verse
Inspired by lonely beats and O.D.B.'s dope rhymes were my first words
Like, can I beg your pardon
Fuck you, can I say what's on my mind?
So one day I started filling up pages with songs I made from my life
Now I'm hangin', so pay it forward
We're bored of the paper chase
We ain't talkin' 'bout fame or fortune
Made resume's from the pain
We just sayin', let's make it awesome
Prayin', it resonates
Like Bansky spray paintin' a portrait on the walls of corporate estates
We be searching for that perfect moment
A surge of inspiration
A surge to evoke emotion, it's more than just entertainment
It's normal to feel uncertain
When caught in a dead end change it
Importance of being earnest
Your purpose is calling, take it
Let's just say, it ain't for the faint heart
I'll make art, imitate art
Concentrate, start a conversation
Spark a movement, instead of brainwashing my illusion
Put faith in music
Escape the bullshit just to get me through the day

In the lab, won't see me 'til the next day

Since I was knee high, to a grasshopper
Read my art proper
And I've never been obsessed with, tryin' to be the best fuckin' chart topper
If you woulda told me ten years ago
That these raps that I spit, that I crafted with
This pad and pen
Woulda took me 'round the planet and then back again
I woulda laughed and said, that you're trippin' man

And immaculate, conception of a dream that I seen 
Where I'd be without it, can't free without it
Yo I don't know, but what I do know
Is I don't do shows, for no Cluedos

Wheel of fortune, sucking you into the game

Babylonian, promising all kinds of thrills
Here they all know what they want
And they chase it with a passion that kills

I locked away my feeling and threw away the key,

Where you drink champagne
It tastes just like Coca Cola, C-O-L-A cola

She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice
She said Lola, L-O-L-A, Lola, L-L-Lola

Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola, L-L-Lola

Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walked like a woman but talked like a man
Oh my Lola, L-L-Lola, L-L-Lola

Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said, ""Dear boy, won't you come home with me?""

Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola
L-L-Lola, L-L-Lola
Lola, L-L-Lola, L-L-Lola

I pushed her away, I walked to the door
I fell to the floor, I got down on my knees
Then I looked at her and she at me

That's the way that I want it to stay
I always want it to be that way for my Lola, L-L-Lola

Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up muddled up, shook up world
Except for Lola, L-L-Lola

Well, I left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said, ""Dear boy, I'm gonna make you a man""

Well, I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man

Looking much too good to be in this bar
I tried to leave but my feet were lead
And the song she played just filled my head

'Cos when she sang out that melody, I heard a sound like a backstreet symphony
My senses sung my head was spun, as I walked through the door
I gotta hear some more

So I watched the show in a state of trance
Staying 'til the end waiting for a chance
To meet with her and make her mine
And keep her there 'til the end of time

When she unfolded that melody, I heard a sound like a backstreet symphony
My destiny had guided me through the bar room door
I got to hear some more, I wanna hear some more

Your purse is nice baby, is it leather?
Or could it be suede

Another drink and it'll slip
From the mind

Took off both my shoes

Sex, she just want to close her eyes and sway
If you, if you, if you exercise your right to forget it
Its true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play
And shes plays only when you tell her no

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good
No boat I float better than he would
No life jacket I’m not the guard in Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I’m just a tenant
My lord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean its still amazing before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Everytime I come around demolition might crush

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved I’d rather diss them
I’d rather call all you put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition gon’ crush

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

If your walls could talk they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them where they are
Take the recipe, the bible and god
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to ""Sing About Me""
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted the same night
So when you play this song rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fucking on a famous rapper

Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment

Thunderstone,"Hear my story, hear my words,
they might speak truth about this world
Hear me opening my heart,
I've seen the years passing by
Seen them wither before they die
Only to be born again

Close your eyes, descend with me
Into the dream that we believe
That's the best we've ever had
Let your mind go with the flow
Let it fly high and low
Throw your self into the memories
Higher, reach higher
Where all our fantasies will come true

We are heading back to our innocence
We're falling in to oblivion
Back to our innocence
We're turning the wheels of time
And living it all again
In the Land of Innocence

What if everthing you've done
Fades away one by one
And you could start it all again
Try to make it another way
Live life to the fullest everyday

We are heading back to our innocence
We're falling in to oblivion
Back to our innocence
We're turning the wheels of time
And living it all again
In the Land of Innocence

If I could take the reins and turn back the hands of time
Long before the womb, long before the morning light
Striving with my maker on the shoulders of the world
Lost inside a myriad...a maze that's so absurd

Before you pass all the crossroads of life
Before you get to the end
You'll face all the pain to get the reward
The greatest of them all
Or is it vain to even dream about this again and again and again?
Does it really matter what you think?
Fantasies are made for us all
And life goes on and on",Land of Innocence,2005
Thunderstone,"Long after midnight, I'm still wide awake
I'm rolling and sweating, my bed is like a lake
Waiting for my peace, waiting is so hard
How much can I take before I'll get scarred

And it feels so
Peaceful and deep

Twenty four seven, forever on the run
Pushing to the limit, reaching for the sun
Can't stop, keep going, got a few more things to do
I know that I will burn myself, before I am through

I fall asleep
And it feels
So peaceful and deep

I try to foretell the signs in me
But I'm too close and too blind to see
What keeps me going on and on?
Maybe I just want to hear the last song

You're standing in the middle, don't know what to do

Put lines through these cries
We pulled all the leaves from the trees that fall

A silent dance that we did into this hospital bed
Hear voices from another room
""It happens all the time""
But July in the sand
Then the leaves fall down
And counting down our days to live
Drain the blood from this valentine.

See blue skies getting caught in the trail of all this smoke
We can rise like candles in the dark, yours always""

Giving up on hope
Living without love

Off the Summer's edge and drown me

We're betting on our own lives
Making up for all the time we lost.

In this house of cards
We're all holding hearts and spades

And you're dressing this color on the edge of fire 
Until these tightened strides 
They march in time again 
I don't know if I will cut through 

I don't know if my heart will beat without you guiding it 

Winding up 
Leading me 
Winding up to explode 

It's the sound of your racing heart 
That beats in time with every start 
(the start of the year. the start of life. the start of war) 
That reaches up and across the sky 
That makes us want to try 

I'm falling to peices 
I can't let go 
Tearing apart your lies 
I want to live 

It's the sound of your shotgun pulse 
Beating over and over in your silent halls 
It's a thought that keeps us alive 
It makes us want to rise 

A scream to guide me through my life 
Winding up 
Leading me 
Winding up to what you can not unwind 

This side of you and if it's taken away 
You won't know what to do 
You're stretching to meet expectations that you will never reach 

And now it's far to late to ever leave this cold

In the shadow of the skyline very far away 
A lightning rod that couldn't pull the storm from me

He fell from these cliffs
The river washed him away the current pulled him downstream
In our eyes, floating in the headlights, so we parked these cars

Listen to the lullaby
Of Carbon Monoxide

We grew up too fast falling apart
Like the ashes of American flags
The sun doesn't rise 
We replaced it with an h-bomb explosion
A painted jail cell of blood in the sky like Three Mile Island
Nightmares on TV they used to sing us to sleep
They burn on and on like an oil field
Or a memory of what it felt like 
To burn on and on and not just fade away
All those nights in the basement the kids are still screaming
On and on and on and on 

War all of the time
In the shadow of the New York skyline
We grew up too fast falling apart
Like the ashes of American flags
And we're blowing in the wind
We don't know where to land

We used to be very tall buildings
We've been falling for so long 
Now your eyes follow the sign on the edge of town
They offer a welcome when you are leaving

Please someone fill me, take away my emptiness
Please someone touch me, take away my longing

Tearing apart your lies
I want to live

It's the sound of your shotgun pulse
Beating over and over in your silent halls
It's a thought that keeps us alive
It makes us want to rise

A scream to guide me through my life
Winding up
Leading me
Winding up to what you can not unwind

This side of you and if it's taken away
You won't know what to do
You're stretching to meet expectations that you will never reach

And now it's far to late to ever leave this cold

I'm giving up
Marching in time with your drums
I'm letting go of everything I once loved",Wind Up [Demo Version],2007
Thursday,"This is what you see when you look in my direction:
Incandescent corsets draw eyes tight like wires
This is how it feels,
Calling out but no one even hears

The signals that we send over the air
Over the air
Over the air
Over the air

When you say my name,
I want to split it from your lips
And hide like whispers in the rain
When you say my name,
I want to stop it in your lungs
And collect all of your blood to put in the radio

Is this how it feels
When you don't even fit into your own skin?
And its getting tighter,
Every day I'm getting smaller
If I keep holding my breath I'm going to disappear

When you say my name,
I want to split it from your lips
And hide like whispers in the rain
When you say my name,
I want to stop it in your lungs
And collect all of your blood to put in the radio

There's no where to hide
They stole the love from our lives to put the sex on the radio
There's no where to hide
They stole the love from our lives to put the sex on the radio

If I keep holding my breath, all of this will fade away
If you keep driving we'll be lying in the wreck
Changing the shape,
Folding like an envelope o keep each other in
Shattered glass, broken looks, and mascara gets
Washed away by windshield wiper blades

When you say my name,
I want to split it from your lips
And hide like whispers in the rain
When you say my name,
I want to stop it in your lungs
And collect all of your blood to put in the radio

There's no where to hide
They stole the love from our lives to put the sex on the radio
There's no where to hide
They stole the love from our lives to put the sex on the radio
That's where we hide
The love and lies and sex, on the radio","Signals Over the Air"" [Live at the Starland Ballroom]",2007
Thursday,"Kid, you need some thicker skin,
You don't take punches well.
You're just like your old man
But you're young and scared.
You're weak in your beliefs
And you've got so much to prove
And not a lot of time
Before they get to you.

So please, Stay True.

Yeah, you stick up for your friends
And you've got a lot of heart.
You remind me of myself
Before I lost my nerve.

I've been counting my mistakes.
I can see all that we've lost
And I don't want to talk
About the old days.

Disregard those clapping hands.
They'll turn to punches when you're down.
Disregard the critics' praise.
They'll be the first to tell the news
That you've sold your soul.
Disregard those dollar signs.
They'll buy the biggest house in hell
Where you'll live alone.
Just keep your head down,
Keep your friends close,
Hold fast to your beliefs
And, whatever else you do,
Stay True.
Believe me, when I say,
It's the hardest thing to do.
Stay True.
They'll kill you by inches.
Don't let them make a move.
Stay True.
Look me in the eye
And promise me one thing
Stay True.
Nothing else matters.
None of this is real.

Disregard the cynics' path.
They'll buy a drink and laugh with you
While you trade defeats.
Disregard your fear of death.
We've all got a lot to lose.
Whatever else you do,

And we curse weep till we curse the same god
There's a crack in the ceiling it breaks
Like a neck in my heard and hard goes tumbling down
We go downtown to the river flow
Near the bloodshed in the soulyard you and me,
Tonight we can gather up all the dust and spirits wail,
Fling them into flimsy walls
And fall, then we can burn down love's lonely furnace,
Watch as it smolders and we expire.",Friday Afternoon,1989

(Hey! Grand hustle Bad Boy south lets ride nigga)
Chevy super clean, two or three screens
Watch a nigga be to the left I lean
50 karats in the crown, niggas no more scheme
Just to let you sucker niggas know I'm the king
This green I smoke we call it dro'
It's deadliest from Memphis Tenn
You see my folk we ain't no joke
Don't turn this into a murder scene
I'm paranoid, tone misquoted
Should not since my early teens
But I'm drop that note, grab me under sixteen
You can bring all the niggas you want to bring
Hey! I thought you were running things
All you did was run the screens
Must be out his mind thinking' the steel won't touch him
See it on the bush let it burn like Usher
Click, click, bang you can end the discussion
Ain't shit sweet cause I seen you unpleasant
I steal would spray broad day ain't nothing
The lilac one AK doing something
I'm immuned to the drama
Act a fool if you want to
Lean in my pocket, 40 calb by the stomach
He acting' like he want it, I'm show a nigga somethin'
Somebody finna to have put ?
I don't tolerate suckas who be trying me
Take a special kind of nigga to defies me
Similar to 8ball and MJG been coming that hard since 93
Niggas know, ain't no out shinning me
I've been the G you're trying' to be
I mob with gorillas, squaders and robbers
And killers true niggas gonna ride me

Take a look at my wheels, rolling through the south
Still spinning and I'm still smoking heavy
Look at both of my grills, my motherfucking mouth
Looking just like the rims on the Chevy
Pimp twist I'm a playa still, ballin' in the game come major bills
Come and take a trip with me to hater Ville
On some 24 omegas and gator grill
Fuck a twist, fuck you bitch
I don't really want to have to bust you bitch
Roman gold shine so hard
Niggas out here know they can't touch that shit
I don't trip, niggas pull up
I be lookin' proud when I bust that dutch
Specially when I look at the mac in the black Cadillac
And the bubbles in the hummer truck
When you see a nigga cruise through
Niggas try to jack you and loose my coop is by the kennel wheels
Mother fucker want to take my style
Cause niggas out here know I'm only fucking with the bonnet grills
And the haters want to see me fall
How can I let y'all niggas play me
Shitted on their good then I pull up
From my vehicle while bumpin' 8 Ball and MJG
Twista bitch and I from the shy
With my Memphis connect and I ain't going' lie
We be specializing in and up coming with dope shit
And pulling up in cool whips that's fly
Still drink, still blow, then I creep through the hood real slow
While I bump kamikaze shit, while I scream look at my grill hoe

The club close at five 'o'clock, we pulling up around three
Wood grain wheel gripping, Cinderella sipping
I like my jewelry golden like a piece of fried chicken
Money players is demon like I'm willy beaming
Like a bitch that practice sucking dick and drinking semen
She screaming dreaming, wishing she can be my number one
Forever young, mama I just want to' to have some fun

Don't try to ever take my cash from me
You mine as well, jump of a cliff you fucking crash dummy
Like that's my last money
This for my niggas who be bussin' back to perpetrators
We don't discriminate, we'll hurt now hurt you later
But I ain't worried, I smoke one on you fucking haters
And I'm hiding gators on the refrigerator
Down south Memphis Tennessee pimpin' gotta rep it
The third I did, that nigga rugg, boy that nigga pimpin'

Ho! It's young 'Face, slanging yay everyday
Heavyweight, got a bad bitch in every state
On the grind non-stop till I touch this cake
Mark ass niggas stay the fuck up out my way
I'm a true O.G., you can quote what I say
I'm an H-town nigga from around the way
Southside, ridin' Dirty like I'm UGK
Asshole by nature like my name was Trae
And I don't gang-bang, I patrol the game
And what I'm representing here is putting holes in brains
Before I say the same thing I'll be old and grey
'Fore I fall off and rap about my clothes and chains
Gripping grain and popping trunks, dog but that ain't me
These elbows hit the scene back in eighty-three
I stay street, when it's done, that's that
You could find me in your hood pumping monster crack
I roll over rodents in Rovers with rims on 'em
Sniffing out a rat I expose him and then dome him
A lot of niggas bitches, they claim that they OGs
A straight up pussy and claims that he knows me
You see I, putting out these DVDs
Now my shit done hit the streets, he gots to squat the pee
Got the Feds on his team so they watching me
Mousetrap for a rat, pussy watch and see

I came here to exercise my game
Spread love to the hood is how I do my thang
Smoking weed with my homies, barbecue them wangs
Sip Hennesey and coke cause I don't fuck with drank
Don't pop pills either cause that shit ain't cool
We just drunk a mad Dom 'fore we went to school
Flick off, back then I was smashing boys
Jump wrong, you saw a nigga get his ass destroyed
Same rules right now, I demand respect
And if I slapped one hoe, then her man was next
I'm a kick door robber, a hot-shot driver
A crack rock slanging motherfucker for a dollar
If you dare to be laid, then off in the Lincoln
But if it ain't no way, then believe I'm finna' take it
Cause a nigga with no hustle, it ain't worth this G
And a bitch like this is even worse than that
I've been good at bullshitting but this game can cost
And if a nigga can't maintain, mayne he lost
He a nerd, and they fuck nerds in jail I heard
And as a nigga, I come in here with my balls and my word

Now the subject of this story 
Is about the boys
Runnin' around talkin 'bout how they ride this cars
I was sittin' in the Benz at the age of 19
When I was 21 I had a yellow ferrari
22 I was Porschin' with the top let aback
23 with the Rolls with the pipe to match
24 wasn't trippin' on what I came up in 
I was focusin' how to be like j's back then
Money power and respect was the life I choose
Being famous wasn't nothin' I just like my doe
I was livin' in the fast lane mayne fo' sho'
Sure tip but quick up and let this thang unload
So if I had a problem with you, you the blame you know
Send a message and then this niggas brains explode
So if you see a nigga holla at me passin' by
Show up the deuce when I be leave and don't be askin' why

Paper dip, but never show

Players out chea' on game
Pimp pimping so cold on the hoes and its two below
That we can put out the flame
Of the blue hand of the roof on the coup all I got is bands man
Who got the change?
Who got the number to the nearly burned it down
The club can chirp before the clip hit the pole and do a split 
'Cause we bought wings
We ain't talking about flight, talking lemon pepper vodka with ice
Spit more on J than steak and the shrimp than mo' gon make in they in life
We ain't tripped up, never hiccup from the drink
Pick up where I left off on the dank
Flex out, never stressed out over chains
Stretched out, get pressed out on the grain
You hear that dere', I make these muthafuckas wanna feel that dere'
When the wheel too big, and the road ain't shit
Make it hard to steer that dere', but it

Make sure it's multiplying is all I'm ever I worried about
If slow money beat no money, what the fuck you in a hurry bout'?
Nigga, I'm saying
Stay getting to that broke shit ain't in my plan
Sleep with the dead, I'ma grind every day that I can
Gots seven kids, and I gotta make sure all of them they fed
By any means
Can't be no excuses, my children can't eat no excuses
My daughter can't sleep in excuses
My son needs to be with paper like keep your excuses
If you ain't producing, you're useless, that's why I'm out here getting to it
Fresh out the booth, I go straight to the stage
Then, I go straight to get paid
Hunnid' I earned, fifty I saved
My bitch don't be cleaning up, I need a maid
She don't be cooking, so I need a chef
You ain't giving me nuthin', I get it myself
I'm doing my thing, and I did it to death

In other words whenever I'm up in your hall
I feel the ripples on the wall
A spectacular feeling when I get up in them draws
And with no hands she can even give an applause
Cause you got me gone, all I can say is “True that”
Whenever I put the soap hole inside you at
Snug, but you can see its something you ain’t new at
Ooh, I can feel it when you do that
I can feel it when you do that, she got a nigga stuck
Murder with the pussy now you just been cut
She got the kush in her bush and I’mma take a puff
Telling me that it’s yours and i can’t get enough
And she talkin’ like

Tell me that it’s the one
Tell me baby it’s the one you been waiting for
Tell me so I can make sure
Tell me baby ‘cause you know that its yours
Oh-woah
You know that it’s yours, that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, Baby (x3)

She got a body like a Maserati
And she got the owochi cochi like a ‘Rochi
Ass fuck her in the back of the Kawasaki
But the flow is a classic so it’s probably a Harley
Hotty be better than any thot around here
I see you [?] that I can be your manager
My place so let me show you I can handle ya
Scott face, I fuck you right over the banister
And it’s the way that you be telling me that its yours baby
How I’m a breathe of fresh air, you been so bored lately
And how you like to be reassured by me telling you that you the one
And how it be mine and how I’m going crazy
You got a nigga caught up in it, every time I’m all up in it
Loving every minute, all I know is I don’t wanna finish
And I’mma be talking to you while I hit it when you ask me to

Tell me that it’s the one
Tell me baby it’s the one you been waiting for

It's not enough for us to sit and wait
As Your awesome power on Earth we must demonstrate

As Your children who seek Your face
We sincerely come to You

Oh Lord won't You please pour out Your Holy Spirit
Come on let it rain on us
With the oil of Your anointing
And Your glory like a flood

As sons and daughters, Lord, we do rely
On Your word that said we'd prophesize
And being strong in faith, flesh we defeat
And the Gospel in our mouth we set the captives free

As Your children who seek Your face
We sincerely come to You
'Cause we can't move until You saturate us

Oh Lord, won't You please pour out Your Holy Spirit
Come on let it rain on us
With the oil of Your anointing
And Your glory like a flood

Come on let it rain on us

Tiago Bettencourt,"Parava no café quando ela estava
Na voz tinha o talento dos pedintes
Entre um cigarro e outro lá cravava a bica
Ao melhor dos seus ouvintes

As mãos e o olhar da mesma cor
Cinzenta como a roupa que trazia
Num gesto que podia ser de amor
Sorria, e ao partir agradecia

Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

Um dia numa sala do quarteto
Passou um filme lá do hospital
Onde o esquecido filmado no gueto
Entrava como artista principal

Compramos a entrada p'ra sessão
Pra ver tal personagem no écran
O rosto maltratado era a razão
D'eu não aparecer pela manhã

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

Mudamos muita vez de calendário
Como o café mudou de freguesia
Deixamos de tributo a quem lá pára
Um louco a fazer-lhe companhia

É sempre a mesma posse o mesmo olhar
De quem não mede os dias que vagueam
Sentado la continua a cravar
Beijinhos as meninas que passeiam

Killed the czar and his ministers 
Anastasia screamed in vain 

I rode a tank 
Held a general's rank 
When the blitzkrieg raged 
And the bodies stank 

Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guess my name
Ah, what's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game

I watched with glee 
While your kings and queens 
Fought for ten decades 
For the gods they made 

I shouted out, 
""Who killed the Kennedys?"" 
When after all 
It was you and me 

Let me please introduce myself 
I'm a man of wealth and taste 
And I laid traps for troubadours 
Who get killed before they reached Bombay 

Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name
'Cause what's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game

Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name
'Cause what's confusing you 
Is just the nature of my game 

Pleased to meet you, pleased to meet you
Guess my name, guess my name
Pleased to meet you, pleased to meet you
Guess my name, guess my name",Sympathy for the Devil,1999
Tiamat,"Touch, touch in the flame's desires

Feeling the pain's denial,

And your fingers in the fire




Look, look in the candle light
See in the flame of life
And my spell is our lie




[Chorus:]
Taste the love



The passion and all the pain are one
The Lucifer's magic that makes you numb


You're sleeping in the fire

Taste the love

The Lucifer's magic that makes you numb
You feel what it does and you're drunk on love
You're sleeping in the fire



I gaze at the flame and fire burn


And cry out the name of which I yearn



[Chorus]

Taste the love


The Lucifer's magic that makes you numb


The passion and all the pain are one

You're sleeping in the fire

Tiamo,"It seem to me that we don't always get along
If we are trying now don't seem to try too long
Watching your neighbour seems to fill you with alarm
Just 'cause he's different now
Don't mean he means you harm
City living has got us all pent up inside
When we have problems it seems we all just run and hide
Time to discover why we are feeling this way
Let's let love have its say

I know you need it, brother said he needs it, sister said she needs it, 
We're all gonna need it someday
We seem to loose our way, somehow got led astray
That's why I'm here to say, gotta get back get back to love
I know you need it, brother said he needs it, sister said she needs it, 
We're all gonna need it someday
We seem to loose our way, somehow got led astray
That's why I'm here to say, gotta get back get back to it now

Trouble started when we don't communicate
We'll build our future now or we can seal our fate
Wasted energy on promises we break
We've wasted chance now, but still it ain't too late
There is a common goal we must all realize
It's time to make a change, in how we live our lives
Time to discover why, we are feeling this way

I'm starting to think it ain't for everybody
Most of us rushing into it anyways, you know what I'm saying
You ain't rushing for love, and I ain't up here to judge
Let's neglect the what if's and make it do what it does
Let's get it

Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
'Cause I had some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck

Lets get it
Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
And the hood girls want a smart nigga, college girls all want a thug
So it seems we fiend for what we don't need
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I'm not bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
'Cause I heard you (bad no)
In the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex saying I love yeah
But to kiss them saying you mean that
I know I just be calling her mean ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed
But the problem is it's probably a deep past
Still I'm feeling of something I need bad
Thinking if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I conceive an ocean by going between legs
Beg, nope, bed, floor, dope
Go, for it, couch, now
Slow, motion, around, put it down
Lord knows she was going for the morn, hold up

Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it

Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you

Let me tell you about, look
She hurt feelings, she break hearts
She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride, in going out
Getting hollered at, and saying nah
She no saint, but she don't pose
She don't wear make up by the boat load
Riding through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard you winter time cold, shawty fall through
Baby look at they approach how they court you
All those minds games never mind cause they all lose
In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you sucking your teeth at, nope
Play big, trust me I'll humble your mean ass, look
Shawty is actually in prevent
Cause the one in front is working deep threat, yep
Bed, floor, couch, more
More, shower, Lord, perm
Done, love, nah
Called in the morning cell number wasn't on, goddamn

Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it

Yeah hold up, bad girls ain't no good,
And the good girls ain't no fun

Yeah, cause real niggas just want (ha)
So it seems that we caught up in the wrong thing
Got a thing for a queen who don't wanna leave
You got a (thing for a king, but you ain't a king)
Seems like the ones who roll never got a ring
And I can see that you're (bad, no to you)
Yeah in the literal sense, I mean the physical sense
I mean the, oops, wait, let me give me a second
I need a minute to vent, I'm only telling you that I heard you (bad girl)
And I'm tellin' you I could believe that
Not the type of fella to yell or be gettin' jealous
But we talkin' 'bout game, Wale got the league pass
We at that bed, floor, couch, hold up

Yeah, I'll be good in bed, but I'll be bad to you

She hurt feelings, she ain't wrong
She work hard, she play harder
Got a smart mouth, like a speed fly
She don't catch feelings she too busy catching G5
She no saint, 'cept Saint Laurent
Gone blaze up, take the wheel Jah
And Rhianna got these women in they River's Island
I'm just tryin' to take a dip ya
Never did terrible bullshit ya
Enough with concerns, she try and live it up
No more sucker for love, she probably duck it because
You try to follow your gut feeling you get lost (Cause I've had some issues)
Yeah and I noticed it
You got the coldest corazon, but warmer skin
You froze with it, you try and play Sub Zero I be Scorpion
Psh get over here today
Smellin' like Jean Paul, got the ye
Got about three friends, she don't even tweet them
Ain't no IG, but she follow K

I don't even mention no niggas, bitches damn

'Cause if you're not telling secrets
Why the cops show at my little cousin's house
And lock him up just for some reefa
Two years, haven't seen him, haven't seen him
Every night before I go to bed I pray to Jesus
And I say to him

About these niggas
I bet you say anything, now tell me
Tell me something I don't know already, already
About these bitches

But I don't pay the money, no I don't pay no mind
'Cause oh oh oh, that don't need me before I need them
No one can take this smile away from my face
Can't take my joy
I'll get over it, you know I will but

If you're not telling secrets
How come she knows that I been fucking with him
But he's in love with her

Hello! Rocking Moncler, never winter home in Montecello
Looking like Ric Flair court side at the Knicks game watching Melo
And when the cameras pass and I'm front row at the Grammys

'Cause you sprinkle it like water

But tell him Ludacris is thankful for his daughter
While we all in the backseat of my Impala
Hut one, hut two, hike, hike, hike
They don’t know about the scratches on my back
And how I call you my bed bug when you bite, bite, bite, bite
Nibbling and dribbling, feeling all of my adrenaline
Tasting like cinnamon, I can think of so many synonyms
You be killin them, other women, be pretending
That they don’t know that you really hardcore like Lil’ Kim and them
Squat down, bend it over, bring it back,
From the side, turn around hunch back, Notre Dame
Turn your device on, it’s the right song
Turn the lights on, Rico Love and you know my name

They don’t know, a loud mouth won’t get you nowhere
Baby I swear (they don’t know)
I’m best friends with Giuseppe
If you let me I’ll put you in something rare (they don't know)
Yeah, I fuck with your home girl back in 06’
Why she keep bringing up old shit
She was cool with a girl I use to go with
But you can tell em both that it’s yo dick
I bet (They don’t know)
That you don’t even speak when you see me in the streets
But you still my little freak, girl
You don’t take pictures, are you blind
Taking light from lame bitches, man why they so weak

Two hundred on my neck, even though I gotta check
She’ll fuck around and spend it on me

Without me (they don’t know)
How that pretty thing cream when you think bout me (bout me)

You’ve been staying in my condo bout a month
It’s a key up on your chain, when you go through some things
Escape whenever you want
They don’t know
How I hit it by the fire
And your legs stretch wider and it just get tighter
They don’t know
That you’re stressed and you’re tired
But the stress gets lighter with the money that I wire (they don't know)
I like to put my lips on, kiss on every part of your body (they don't know)
Do it so well, baby who you gonna tell? Nobody

Give a bitch face a high five
I don’t know why she was looking at me side eye
I don’t even know why I’m sky high
I don’t even know why I’m high, is that a high crime
But I gotta gang of naked pictures that I’m ready to send you
If you just want relations baby there’s nothing I can’t do
You said you looking for something to get into
Oh well I’m looking for someone to give into
Oh they don’t know you got me crazy
And craving and screaming that I wanna have your baby
Post it all up in this bed, all up in my legs
Pulled in like thy Mercedes
Oh they don’t know,
They can’t hang if they don’t smoke
I don’t fuck with niggas if they don’t blow
And that ain’t no joke

Let’s keep it between me and you
And we cool 'cause they don’t know

Ey they be all in your ear
While you stick around while you’re here
All he do is let you down, does he care?
How your smile disappear
How many times you cried in a year
Is it love, or the pride and the fear
Did you try to interfere
How she gonna dive off a pier
With some concrete shoes on their heel (I’ll arrange that)
Hope they know they talking loud, blowing smoke
When it’s clear I’ll be standing right here (turn the lights on)
Ever since we met, you done had the best (that's right)
Wait a little longer it got better than that
Ok, I gave everything that I had in my check
Never held back, was you telling em that?
Man, I’m the answer to the question, where them felonies at?
Don’t have me waiting for the cat like where the hell is he at
Aye the love of my life, you gone forever be that
Whoever questioning that I guess it’s clear to see that

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

That you were comin'

Always wondered if she knew about us
When I met ya you said ya'll had broke up
Right on time cuz I didn't have my love
Me and him was also messed up
That let me fall to you
And from what I could tell you fell too
And I wonder if it would be wrong
If we just kept it on

And I know we
Both had someone that we just kept from
And they still think that they're the only ones
I like the way we hang but it ain't belong
We know the feelings they don't know

Always thought that he knew about you
When I met you I said we were through
In time my feelings came right back
But I didn't let us get off track
And I got so into you
Went too fast what do I do
When I know I shoulda helped it out
But you just turn me on

And they still think that they're the only ones

We kept things pretty tight thus far
Love without the sex
And hundred thousand dollar cars
Ain't it funny how our auras unify
An entity upon itself
That can spread wings and fly
A peaceful coexistance that will surely last
Becomes a reminiscent dream
For those in our past
If they knew just a fraction of all the things we do
They still wouldn't comprehend
The depth between me and you

And I know we
Both had someone that we just kept from
And they still think that they're the only ones

Tic,"There's no king when love is the thing
We play the same rules
In a heartbeat a wiseman can be a fool
There's no guarantee that love will be

A stranger or a friend
A prayer that's answered 
Or a heartache that never ends
Through the darkest hours 
When all is said and done
It has the power
You go from lonely to the lucky one

Love's funny that way
Now matter who you are
It can shake your faith
Or it can break your heart
Once in a while the mountains move
We all long for those days
You live, you laugh, you say
Love's funny that way

Not long ago I got to know the lonely side
Just me and my pain and nowhere to hide
It amazes me
How my world turned around
If it's meant to be
That's all that matters to me anyhow

Love's funny that way
No matter who you are
It can shake your faith
Or it can break your heart
Once in a while the mountains move

You live, you laugh, you say
Love's funny that way

Tic,"Remember back in the time
When the only sign we had was pickets
But now in '94, it be this way, somethin' come wicked
G-angs killin' others for colors
Thangs that we wear for fashion
Other brothers take it for a reason to be blastin'
What the kcuf is goin' on
Not soft like buttercups but
Had enough of singin' that same song
See, I stayed across the street from the projects
Took out yo' momma trash and groceries to her trunk
To keep my pockets fat, like cellulite
Only been to jail one week for some shull-bit
And I pray to God I won't repeat
I shoulda pulled it when I had the chance to
No, I shouldn't a did that, cause if I did that
Y'all would not hear that phat shit
That keeps you on your tippy-tippy-toes
Like that sellout, not callin' no names
But really, ""who's bad""
I go through obstacles like a whole box of condoms
You can't forget where you come from

Take a good look in the mirror
And tell me, do you like what you see
Masters of deception, corruption and evil
But you're always quick to point the finger at me
Won't somebody tell me

I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel
Like there's nothing to live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday

What gave you the right to misjudge me
And write me off on the wall
Acting as if you understand me
In reality, you just don't know me at all

Sometimes I can't help but wonder
If this was how it's meant to be
But if you search deep enough in your soul
You'll always find a slight reminder of me
Won't somebody tell me

I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel
Like there's nothing to live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday

A-yo, if we could all agree
To lettin' our souls become free
Of that sweet bitterness
Then who's chest would have the most seeds
I keep misfocusin' my needs
And distress on my back with them cats
They be blastin' into my knapsack
Ain't no accidental deathtraps
My mishap is the fact that I'm destined to snap
It's when I feel as though my body's able to go
My mind is ready to flow
Did you know first you catch and then I throw
It's my own sense of time
If I'm late, it's cause I'm endin' my day
Just when the sun shines
And still gently advising the arisin' of the moon
As it rolls around into my soundproof dimension

I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel
Like there's nothing to live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday

Du gehst mir auf den Keks, noch nie gehört von AIDS

Und zieht sich jetzt dein Pillermann nicht sofort einen Gummi an
Sag ich Dir klipp und klar, dann bin ich nicht mehr da

Tickle Me Pink,"There's a girl back home I use to know
She cried her self to sleep every night
We all knew
We all knew
Only girl who would ever compromise
Strike a deal with the devil to save a night
We all knew
We all knew
She tried to call me a month ago
To sing me a song that she just wrote
But I wasn't home
I should've know
That time had taken it toll
She had no place to go
They found her body resting by the river
Oh I never said good bye
I wish I would have tried
I couldn't hear her cries
As she filled her veins with lies
Until she saw the light

I remember we would hide behind the trees
Smoking cigarettes until our throats would bleed
Those were the days
Those were the days
Yeah
Never scared
Never worried that the summer would end
Invincible to every sharp end
We drove so fast
Thought it would last
But time had taken it toll
She had no place to go
They found her body resting by the river
Oh I never said good bye
I wish I would have tried
I couldn't hear her cries
As she filled her veins with lies
Until she saw the light

We'll see you on the other side
Die
If I could could turn back time
I'd find a way to remind you
That some how you could try to give in and fight the good fight

You filled your veins with lies

Every time I drop they copping, every single line I lay is locking
You a hater, boy, stop your plotting, it'll be your blood we mopping
Talk about that major flavor, keyed up, cut like a razor
Lyrically I stake and bake ya, you can see I get that paper
Wear jet black like Darth Vader, hopping out on playa haters
It's in my n-n-nature, never been a smoother operator
Switch it up, hit it up, get it up, let it up
Your girl from the back, like giddy up
How come I run, you like my son, I blow the whole god damn city up
Inside that long white milky Bentley like I just picked Diddy up
Think about that while you doubt that, you a fake mac, you can't count that
Hop all off then I bounce back, got 'em looking a wolf pack outback
I'm from where them GOAT GOAT, shout that
Ask Master P, I'm bout that
Everybody know I'm holding, in the party, pocket swollen
Rock and rolling, competition catching coals in they colon

What up y'all, y'all know us
Know the party ain't ill til we show up
Once we hit the scene, the chicks go nuts
Sorry if I intervene, ma, but so what
Pour more cups of the drink, cups of the guz stop
Til I'm all drunk in the place, burn the kush to the face
Making the dudes wanna hate, 'cause we them new dudes in the state

Feel like a barbecue, shorty keep grilling me up
In the club doing stacks where a ceiling be

Do my lean, big black truck
Coming through like I'm moving that stuff

Tico Torres,"Barkeep pour me one last shot, 'cause I must be on my way
Gotta make that same old stop that this soul makes everyday
Tell me why am I holding on? Harry, why is the love a flame?
It burns you when it's hot, but Cupid's fire trucks never came
I can't bend the hands of time, so I think myself to sleep
The way you never said goodbye if only in my dreams

Tell me where you want to go
Tell me what you long to be
Are you longing for my touch? If only in my dreams
We'll sing the love songs you once sung
Touch the stars you want to reach
And I will see the job gets done, if only in my dreams

Lord, I'd sacrifice my eyes, there's nothing else I'd rather see
You can have my heart, it's of little use to me
And if you want my soul, I'd throw it in for free
It's all I'm worth that's left, since my angel got her wings
Now I'm down and on my knees, it's of little use to pray
Unless you give her back, but there's no deals cut these days
They're only in my dreams

Tell me where you want to go
Tell me what you long to be
Are you longing for my touch? If only in my dreams
We'll sing the love songs you once sung
Touch the stars you want to reach
And I'll see the job gets done, if only in my dreams

Now I curse the daytime
When I'm alone at night time
'Cause I swore the sun shined just for you
And I know you anywhere
There ain't no pain, there ain't no tears
And if I have my way from the moment I get there

Take me where you wanna go
We'll be who you wanna be
All I needed was your touch, all I want is you and me
We'll sing the love songs you once sung
And you'll be in my dream

Tierney Sutton,"Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever, when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever, when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet, she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, ""Julie, baby you're my flame""

Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm afire
Fever, yeah, I burn for sooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, ""Daddy, oh don't you dare""

He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
Daddy, won't you treat him right? Go

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade

They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever, if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

",Fever,

Now that we're cosy and clinging,

Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is

I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is

Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

J'vise ni le Ritz ni le Fairmont; passe une prod', je la démonte-monte
Illettré, je sais pas compter, je sais quand l'huissier veut vider mon compte
Mon discours parle de ces tours H.L.M. que j'ai habitées
Je ne cours plus après mes rêves, j'cours après ma réalité
Je ne cours plus après les featuring dans le rap français
Narguilé sur narguilé, leur boîte crânienne est inhabitée
L'esprit, c'est comme un parachute, gros: c'est mieux quand il s'ouvre
Quand tu m'découvres, écoute: mes couplets
Découpent des rappeurs, des groupes

C'est véridique, j'connais des muslims qu'ont des caractères de cochon
J'suis terre-à-terre avec ma musique d'esclave, on n'est pas des moutons
C'est ironique, on vend des t-shirts ""Toby"" cent-pour-cent coton
On m'appelle ""Le dernier Solaar"", mais je ne suis qu'un petit MC
J'n'aime que les militants, pas les militaires, pas les colons, pas les colonels, pas les colonies

Ça sert à rien d'attendre la fin du son, y'aura aucun dédicace

Pour les artifices, tous les sacrifices parfois que j'peux oublier

This mood is like a dream
The night we've waited for so long it seems
Has come, to make us crazy, and we got
No place to hide
Heroes and virgins baby
Life gets so urgent baby
Being your friend has been very nice
But I don't want to be after tonight
The moon is giving us its perfect light
The radio's beating
And the words keep repeating

Next to you I just want to be with you baby
Maybe I'll stay devoted to you dedicated

I knew some day you'd need to find
Something that you left behind
Something I can't give you

And like a night love disappears
My heart's so good for souvenirs
And memories are forever

All and all I've no regrets
The sun still shines the sun still sets
And the heart forgives, the heart forgets
Oh what will I do now with all this time?

One more kiss
Even though it's come to this
I'll close my eyes and make a wish
Hoping you'll remember

All This time
All and all I've no regrets
The sun still shines the sun still sets
And the heart forgives, the heart forgets
Oh what will I do now with all this time?

Say Goodbye
A bond will make another time
Don't be sorry if you cry
I'll be crying too

It's you
That I really want in my life
You're the one that loves me so right
It's you
You always stop the beat in my heart
I'll love you to my death! please don't stop

I never had a love that felt right
Until you came into my life
I always wanted to have someone
Who I could call my own and make love fun

I remember when I was all alone
My heart cried and cried just to be with you
Then into my life you came like a storm
Then I realized that you're here for me...and

I hope to make our love grow stronger
'cause I want you don't need no other
I know this love will last forever
So won't you stay with me don't go away

I just can't believe that you're here with me
You're a dream come true baby can't you see
And forever more I'll be by your side
Just one kiss from you I'm in paradise...'cause

They say that moss won't grow
On a rolling stone
You can't catch a rising star
So I keep on running
Doesn't matter what people say
As long as I'm happy

Jump up turn around
Faster than the speed of sound
Follow me all over town
Never run my motor down

They say it's hard to hit
On a moving target
That's why I always quit
Before it's even started
Live my life the way I see
'cause my time is for me

Jump up turn around
Faster than the speed of sound
Follow me all over town
Never run my motor down

Maybe one day
All my hopes and dreams will come true
But until they do...

Nobody's blue eyes ever cut like that
The distance in between us is hard to hold
My heart can't take this beating all alone
I want you
Need you
Gotta have you

I'm almost in love
I'm almost in love

Looking in your eyes I can see tomorrow
For somebody like me that's so far away
I need to feel you breathing when I breathe
That promise you've been keeping is someone's dream I want you
Need you
Gotta have you

Turn out the light
Darkness makes me sentimental
Warm breeze wraps around us
And there's comfort in your voice

On second thought
Please leave on that one blue candle
Life reveals your secrets
And it gives my eyes a choice

All the shadows dance upon the walls
Love is all that's left to say
As the glow from that one blue candle
Softly lights the way

And tomorrow when the world returns
And the shadows of the night depart
Will the light from that one blue candle
Still be burning in our hearts?

By candle light
These moments slowly melt together
And we'll make love last forever
This time it's only us

All the shadows dance upon the walls
Love is all that's left to save
As the glow from that one blue candle
Softly lights the way

And tomorrow when the world returns
And the shadows of the night depart

I'd go off and sell my soul

You should know that my smile was leading to this
It's all in this letter
Strange how your wings ache like a son of a bitch
Just when you're, just when you're finally better

Someone like you just better watch where you step
People have been known to bleed
See how my words read like a kick in the head
Sometimes that's just what you need

Fly away my butterfly
Fly away
Fly away my butterfly

Don't you know that my smile was misleading
I have outgrown my cocoon
By the time that you read what you're reading
I will have flown to the moon

Fly away my butterfly

Fly away...

I talk to myself (myself), when there is no one to talk to
[Repeat]

[Tiffany:]
Ever wonder just what it's like talkin' to yourself every night?
Will I ever make it through the day?

[Krayzie:]
It's so hard to believe that I'm still living, I'm alive
My clock is still ticking, guessing that God is still with me (with me)
'Cause I could have been gone so many times before
Murda Mo is chasing me I'm barely escaping it
My instincts is tellin' me that I might not live long in my life (my life)
My life is a jungle I really don't love it it's really to crumble
I fight with these devils on daily basis
And I try to stay humble
Try not to fall, but what if I slip, trip?
Try to stay calm, but what if I flip?
Kill 'em all
Last night I had a long talk with myself (myself)
Drama had a nigga wondering, wondering how close am I to hell
Then I had to pray can't let them brake me, awww nah, awww nah
But it's everyday they try to make me soft
But so fried, so high is my mistake
Don't worry when I'm in the clouds
Well that's how I stay (stay)

[Chorus: Tiffany:]
Ever wonder just what it's like talkin' to yourself every night?
Will I ever make it through the day?
Never thought I make it this far
Kinda wonder just where you are?
Will you ever make it through the day?

[Krayzie:]
Caught up in my complications nowhere to go
It's mandatory that I face them, even though I don't want to
They say karma can murda ya, murda ya
All this drama just got me nervous
'Cause I know I've popped shots that don't stop
They don't stop
Soon as I lose it they know I get stupid
Ain't nowhere to you, to you
Stop, stop, look, look, listen
Where heard them
I'm hearin' they put to get me (get me)
Can't let 'em get me
I won't stop dumpin' until my clique is empty (empty)
When this one finish (finish) I'm buckin' 'til I put my other clip in (clip in)
Then get up spittin' back at y'all (back at y'all)
That's 'cause the can't get with this at all
The war is really raw (raw, raw, raw, raw)

[Chorus]

And I told myself I can't depend on one
No one else

Hate to say it, I done went crazy [Repeat]

When I was young
I never had no rules
I could do anything
As long as I believed
It's been a long time
I made it through the rain
You brought back everything
And I have found my wings

I can fly again
I found my heart
Waiting with you
A love that's true
I feel so alive
I can fly again
No letting go
It's where I belong
A love that's strong
For all of my life

Remember the times
I looked for brighter days
Hoping that things would change
And turn it all around
Now that you're here
I can see everything
Ride on the joy you bring
And lift me off the ground

I can fly again
I found my heart
Waiting with you
A love that's true
I feel so alive
I can fly again
No letting go
It's where I belong
A love that's strong

Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you going to drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men
Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders we're getting in tune
The music's played by the madman

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever young.

Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young
It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth is like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever
So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams are swinging out of the blue
We let them come true

Tiffany Evans,"Have you ever walked down a dark road
Not sure which way to turn
Or been the passenger in a speeding car
So afraid you might get hurt

Somehow someone saved me
An invisible hand and a indestructible love

There are angels on earth
There right by your side
Your saved and you can't explain why
When you think your alone
And no one can hear your pray
Angels on earth will be there (o yeah)

Have you ever wished upon a shining star
Hoped that your wish will come true
Or watched somebody you loved passed on
But strangely your not alone

Somehow something guides you
An invincible hand
The most fearful love

There are angels on earth
There right by your side
Your saved and you can't explain why
When you think your alone
And no one can hear your pray
Angels on earth will be there

Forget when your in a hole
Their right there to bring you home (oh yeah)
Just close your eyes
And they'll help you to fly

How many times did you say sorry
Just to turn around and say you don't want me
Flip it back, back and spend a night callin oh oh oh...

Ran across some pictures
And a couple letters you wrote
Kinda had me reminiscing
Bout when it was different
Right before you let me go
Cause even though we had to finish
(Baby I admit it)
You was worth my heart gettin' broke
Cause I ain't never had those feelings
I ain't get to say it last time we spoke

[Chorus]
Even though it's goodbye
Before I run into you
I just wanted you to know
Your my
Favorite broken heart
Even though
I've cried
I don't wanna beef here
I will always be here for you
Your my
Favorite broken heart

So why you gotta blast ya name in the streets
And tell everybody I made dirt about you oh
And everything we been through
Is between me n you baby boy (fasho)
We ain't gotta be the cliche exes
With the (he say she say)
Like we ain't grown
If you ain't got nobody these days
Maybe you can hit me on my cell or at home.

It's been so long
Since I saw ya
Still I got nothing
But love for ya
Tell me that you know that I'm
Always here
Whenever however forever

Thank you
If I could do it all again
Id do the very same thing
Knowin' that you
Would hurt me in the end

I know you'll be there whenever I need you
No matter what I'm still ya friend

Everybody to the floor, why' 'cause this beat is sick, yeah
It's time to rock, uh, that's what it is
Tiffany's her name, love is the game

Sometimes a girl needs to know that she's
Appreciated for all the things she does
With some sorta token of love
'Cause without it her young heart won't know

And right then to my surprise, he
Pulled out a small velvet box, pink ribbon tied
I'm wondering what's inside
He opened it and then he replied

He said, I promise not to hurt you, I promise not to lie
I promise to befriend you and defend you with my life
I promise you forever, I promise you today, he said
Would you wear my promise ring' I said yes

It was your heart he felt now it shows, now it shows

I'm older and they call me by your name
I'll wear it on a chain, because I can hear you say

The city lights is on, now, they wanna turn 'em off
Try'nna start some shit, actin' like you never made a penny for 'em
Dun, they doin' you dirty, we had Summer Youth for that, though
No need to cry, never get worried
You gon' live forever, word to mother
'cause she raised you right, and you got fifty-one brothers
I sat with the trees and had conversations at bees
We talked about throwin' money up, landscapin' your knees

Show me where to take the check, pay these suckas off and be out
The'll never be another place, everybody happy to see
That's why I keep coming back to you, peace

That's what me and my children have known.
I worked the mill the way my parents did.
I remember this town when I was a kid.
Sitting through the movies twice,
Open windows late at night,
Slipping out in the summer heat,
To meet John Miller in the middle of the street.

[Chorus]
They laid a highway a few years back,
Next town over by the railroad track.
Some nights, I'm glad it passed us by.
Some nights, I sit and watch my hometown die.

I'm fifty-five and when the mill burned down,
I wasn't much past a pretty young gal.
Boss lit a match in the oily night,
Cops never had enough to set it right.
So while the company traded with our lives,
We were busy watching the slow moon rise,
Dancing on the dry grass bridge,
Making love down by the Cedar County Bridge.

[Chorus]

They never came to tear that old place down.
They roped it off, but you can walk around,
See the rust on the painted doors,
Watch the rain fall through the burned out floors.

Cause these well-worn threads of daylight will sometimes come apart,
Giving way to all the shadows where no one can hear your heart,
So down in the dark, if that's where you are

It's something to me

Now the tender hands of morning have given up a new sunrise,
And we all get up together in our ordinary lives,
Going one step for another giving up has crossed my mind,
But I'll take a long day, come round the right way",Something to Me,2008
Tift Merritt,"I woke up beside you in the night afraid
When I was young I was always brave
I was going where the wind was born,
I don't know where that is anymore
Sometimes my heart feels so empty and mean,
No blanket could warm, no water could clean,
No direction on that same old wind
Could give me passage through

[Chorus]
Tell me something true
Tell me something true
I have lost my way but when I find it, I'll bring it to you

I've heard about sunshine and I know about May,
But it doesn't always work out that way
How do you give your heart back to the world
That's made a fool of you?

[Chorus]

Time's gonna come here so remiss,
He will forget my words, forget my kiss
If you want to love me, better take me like this,
I think the best that I can do is tell you something true

Tift Merritt,"Once I ran like the wildest horse
I reached up high and I clinched my fist
What happened then goes just like this,
Oh the tender branch is gonna fall

I was young and I thought it brave,
Fighting to find the mystery's face
You got to give it a gentler chase,
Cause oh the tender branch is gonna fall

Sometimes you fall up these stairs, but it's a long time 'fore you know
No matter where my heart is now, there's a long, long way to go

There is a church in St Sulpice
I've seen the pilgrims come to pray
I'm gonna lean in hard on that grace,
Cause oh the tender branch is gonna fall",Tender Branch,2008

Don't ask me what comes after today.
Sweet Emily's eyes are all I am thinking of.
Don't ask me what comes after today.

Nobody means for the gun to off, nobody wants it this way.
Nobody sees how the deal went bad but the ones living it everyday.

Up on 145th,
You can see the bridge but you can't cross the way.

No matter what you are, you get used to the chains.

Times we were broke, we'd laugh about it.
Sometimes we'd just leave town, go down to the shore,
Watch the waves close out, just to be close, just to be close.

I don't want to fight anymore,
About childish things we did before,
I didn't mean what I said last night.
I love you more than who is right and wrong,
I want to stay and I made this song
Of all the reasons we don't have to fight.

These words we shout, so who's to say
Where they will go when they fall away?
Maybe they hang around with the lonely kids,
With a balled up fist, saying, you did this, you did this.

I don't want to fight anymore,
About what we lost or things we swore.
I didn't mean what I said last night.
I love you more than who is right and wrong,
I'm gonna stay and made this song

On what we've broken and throw away.

Could you help me out? Can we put it back, put it back?

And even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you, honey,
Everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning when I rise,
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes,
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.

Love a guy who holds the world in a paper cup,
Drink it up, love him and he'll bring you luck.
And if you find he helps your mind, better take him home.
Don't you try to live alone. Try to earn what lovers own.

Maybe you could just stare it down.
Seems like some tenderness could turn the whole thing around.

I'm just trying to get the engine to turn.
I'm just trying to smile through my tears.
And I still got so much to learn,
But the best I can is what I have to give,
Gonna give it while I'm here.

Most days I want to speed up.
Seems like I ought to slow down.

about how it's done nothing wrong.

From a storm in the sails to the breath on your lips,
It's such a little thing, then again, then again,

The feel of the world in your hands, in your hands.

Out to the edge of the world, out where the sky starts to bend,
After awhile in the sun, you'll be sleeping, sleeping.

Oh like a rare b-side.

I'm just making you mixtapes with homemade covers.
Analog to show we're lovers,
And here under the jacket folds inside,
I've taped my heart for you to find.

To find the perfect way,
Which album to say,
I la la love you.

Let me tell you why they got me on file
'Cause I give you what you lack, come right and exact
Our status is the saddest so I care where you at, black

And at home I got a call from Tony Rome
The FBI was tappin’ my telephone
I never live alone, I never walk alone
My posses always ready, and they’re waitin’ in my zone

Although I live the life that of a resident
But I be known to scheme that of the president
Tappin’ my phone whose crews abused
I stand accused of doin’ harm

'Cause I’m louder than a bomb
Come on
I’m louder than a bomb
Come on

I am the rock hard trooper to the bone the bone the bone
Full grown consider me stone
Once again and I say it for you to know
The troop is always ready, I yell Geronimo

Your CIA, you see I ain’t kiddin’
Both King and X they got ridda’ both
A story untold, true, but unknown
Professor Griff knows I ain't milquetoast

Of those with closed minds, don’t know I’m rapid
The way that I rap it is making 'em tappin', yeah
Never serving ‘em well, 'cause I’m an Un-Tom
It’s no secret at all

'Cause I’m louder than a bomb
Come on
I’m louder than a bomb
Come on

Cold holdin’ the load, the burden breakin’ the mold
I ain't lyin’ denyin’ because they’re checkin’ my code
Am I buggin’ 'cause they’re buggin’ my phone for information
No tellin’ who’s sellin’ out buildin’ the nation

Joinin’ the set, the point black target
Every brother's inside so least not, you forgot, no
Takin’ the blame is not a waste, here taste
A bit of the song so you can never be wrong

Just a bit of advice, ‘cause we be payin’ the price
'Cause every brother man's life is like swingin’ the dice, right?
Here it is, once again this is the brother to brother
The Terminator the cutter

Going on and on, leave alone the grown
Get is straight in ’88, an' I’ll troop in to demonstrate
The posse always ready 98 at 98
My posse come quick, because my posse got velocity

Tapping’ my phone, they never leave me alone
I’m even lethal when I’m unarmed

‘Cause I’m louder than a bomb
Come on
‘Cause I’m louder than a bomb
Come on

‘Cause the D is for dangerous, you can come and get some of this
I teach and speak so when it’s spoke, it’s no joke
The voice of choice the place shakes with bass
Called one for the treble, the rhythm is a rebel

Here’s a funky rhyme that they’re tappin’ on
Just thinkin’ I’m breakin’ the beats that I’m rappin’on
CIA, FBI, all they tell us is lies
And when I say it they get alarmed

‘Cause I’m louder than a bomb
‘Cause I’m louder than a bomb

‘Cause I’m louder than a bomb

3 weeks since we said goodbye
And now how am I hard, as I try
Supposed to last a whole lifetime

The days are fine
I keep my mind
Occupied and satisfied
I keep my eyes on the consolation prize

But in the night
I lose the fight
I toss and turn
While my fears unite

My teeth grind every time
The visions come, I wish I was blind
They're teasing me, endlessly
With a dream that was, but can never be

I was never meant to be without you
I was never meant to be without you
I supposed in time, I will get by
But I was never meant to be without you

Well, now it's been
3 weeks since I wrote this song
Now the future's wrong seems way too long
I thank the stars you taught me to be strong

And now I walk the line
Your hand in mine
Your still my guide, side by side
I tell myself it's just a matter of time

And now my life keeps movin' by
And now I hear your voice in mine
I still smile most of the time
At memories, our lives intertwined

You're keeping me company
With a love that was, and will always be
