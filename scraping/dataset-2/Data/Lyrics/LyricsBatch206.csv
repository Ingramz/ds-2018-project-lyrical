As only you can do
Hold my hands down beside me

Elvis Presley,"When your asleep beside me, I watch you lying there
Your hand upon the pillow and moonlight in your hair
I get the warmest feeling, so good I almost cry
I kiss your sleeping lips and say I'll love you 'till I die

Oh girl of mine you make my day
One sunny smile and all the clouds just roll away
Eyes deep as the sea seem to say to me
Our love will always be
So girl of mine turn out the light
And in my arms together we'll make sweet love tonight
Down life's golden road and you'll always know
I love you ... girl of mine

Sometimes I know I hurt you when things ain't goin' right
I walk away and leave you to face the lonely night
I wouldn't blame you darlin' if you walked out on me
But I return to find you there still waiting patiently

Oh girl of mine you make my day
One sunny smile and all the clouds just roll away
Eyes deep as the sea seem to say to me
Our love will always be

And in my arms together we'll make sweet love tonight

I love you ... girl of mine

I thought I knew the score
Now you've treated me so wrong
I can't take any more

And it looks like I'm never gonna fall in love again
Fall in love, I'm never gonna fall in love
I mean it, I mean it, fall in love again

I gave my heart so easily, cast aside my pride
When I saw you in his arms baby

Elvis Presley,"Maybe it's too late. Sometimes I even hate myself for loving you
Trying to be strong then nighttime comes along and I start loving you
Wanting you. Where is all my self control I'm burning way down in my soul
And needing you, and wishing I could be the man, I try to
Hating me for wanting you to be with you knowing you don't love me like you used to
But it's midnight, Oh and I miss you

It's getting late and I know that's when I am weak
Funny how things have a way of looking so much brighter in the day light
I ought to go to bed to try and straighten out my head and just forget you

Elvis Presley,"You're sleeping son, I know
But, really, this can't wait
I wanted to explain
Before it gets too late
For your mother and me
Love has finally died
This is no happy home
But God knows how I've tried
Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy
I know it's hard to understand
Why did we ever start?
We're more like strangers now
Each acting out a part
I have laughed, I have cried
I have lost every game
Taken all I can take
But I'll stay just the same
Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy
Sleep on, you haven't heard a word
Perhaps it's just as well
Why spoil your little dreams
Why put you through the hell
Life is no fairytale
As one day you will know
But now you're just a child
I'll stay here and watch you grow
Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy

Elvis Presley,"I hope I never ever love anyone this much again
I can't take it anymore, I've been hurt before
Never ever quite like this time

What will become of me when you're no longer here
If I can't stop loving you, what am I to do
You'll be free but where will I be

Now that I'm used to love, how can I stand alone
Now that love has come and gone, like the ending of a song
A song my lonely heart keeps singing

Where do I go from here, will I get over you
If so, next time I?ll be smart, I?ll know before I start

Elvis Presley,"Oh just because I asked a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I rang her number by mistake today
You know she thinks I, I still care

And just because I haunt the same old places
With a memory I will linger everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be
Lord, you know, she thinks I still care

Well, if she's happy thinking I still need her
Yea, let that silly notion bring her cheer
Oh how could she ever be so foolish
Tell me where did she get, lord such an idea

Yea, oh lord
Just because I asked a friend about her
And you know, just because I spoke her name somewhere

Elvis Presley,"There was a man, a lonely man
Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unchecked
Until it died in his silence

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

Another day, a lonely day
So much to say that goes unspoken
And through the night, his sleepless nights
His eyes are closed, his heart is broken

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
She's coming back again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

A little hope, goes up in smoke
Just how it goes, goes without saying
Solitaire
And by himself it's easy to pretend 
He'll never love again
Ohhh

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere

Elvis Presley,"Take good care of her, take good care of her
I suppose I ought to say congratulations
For you won the only girl I ever loved
But I hurt too much to face the situation
Just take good care of her, take good care of her

Just to be around her was my greatest pleasure
She was everything my future held in store
So remember when you take my only treasure
Just take good care of her, take good care of her

I must accept it, she loves you more than me
So with my broken heart I'll bow out gracefully

Elvis Presley,"The old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and my papa

Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and the lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reachin', smiling sweetly
Oh, it's good to touch the green, green grass of home

The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on

Yeah, down the lane I'll walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and the lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reachin', smiling sweetly
Oh, it's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Then I awake and look around me
At four gray walls that surround me
And I realize I was only dreamin'

There's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak again
I'll touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old tree
As I lay me in the green, green grass of home

I grew to love you more each passing day
Before too long I built my world around you
And I prayed you'd love enough of me to stay
If you love me let me know. If you don't then let me go
I can't take another minute of a day without you in it
If you love me, let it be. If you don't then set me free
Take the chains away that keep me lovin' you
The arms that open wide to hold me closer
The hands that run their fingers through my hair
The smile that says hello, it's good to see you
Anytime I turn around to find you there
It's this and so much more that makes me love you
What else can I do to make you see?
You now you have whatever's mine to give you
But a love affair for one can never be

Tonight she'll hold me in her arms
I'd rather be holding hydrogen bombs

I'm not his Juliet

Needs me
Like a hole in the head

Shifted from town to town
No job can hold me down, I'm just a knock-around guy
There's a lot of space beneath that sky
Till I find my place there's no doubt...
I'll be a rovin' roustabout

Call me the carefree kind
I wander with the breeze
My mind and heart's at ease
Doing what pleases me best
Gotta keep-a movin' east or west
Till I find my place there's no doubt
I'll be a rovin' roustabout

And even if a pretty girl, should catch my eye
I'll give her a quick ""hello"", and a fast goodbye

I'll go the way I want
Driftin' just like the sand
Doin' what job I can
Changing my plans as I choose
Long as I keep happy I can't lose
Till I find my place there's no doubt

I'm a poor hawaiian beach boy
A long way from the beach
'cause someone shoved his face against my hand
Now I'm a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
I'm in the can

I was minding my own business
But drinking daddy's juice
I swear I'll never touch that stuff again
Just like a pig before he gave his all that aluhau
I'm in the pen

Got those beach boy blues
Don't the time go slow
Lonely beach boy blues
Only 30 day's and 90 years to go

I want a taste of honey
From my wahini's lips
I want to be her ever loving man
But I'm a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
I'm in the can

And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads

By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because

They thought we fit together walkin'
It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find

That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see

You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the back roads

By the rivers of my memory
Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Gentle on My Mind,1984

Carry it home and cook it for supper

We almost seem like strangers
All that's left between us are the memories we shared
Of times we thought we cared for each other

And pick up all the pieces left behind us
And maybe someday, somewhere along the way

Some day when she's older, maybe she will understand
Why her mom and dad are not together
The tears that she will cry when I have to say goodbye
Will tear at my heart forever

long before the human race,
Something stirred,
A vast and timeless source began,
Intelligence was born and then,
there was the world,
Powers filled the universe,
matter formed and broke the curse,
Of nothingness,
Love became an ageless soul,
nature reached her highest goal,
And breathed the breath of life,
Everlasting life.

Well creatures come from out of sight,
Daylight came from in the night,
and all was good,
Life became a masterplan,
Love produced the perfect man,
that understood,
The image of the makers word,
worshipped him with all he had,
But then one day,
From in the depths an evil seed,
grew and manufactured greed,
That changed the way of life,
Everlasting life,

Oh the loving power looked and saw,
Inside the heart of man a flaw,
began to grow,
Well, the fires of hell began to burn,
and so he sent his chosen son,
To let us know,
That love had surely made us all,
and hate would surely make us fall,
So from the cross,
Well he showed the world that dreadful day,
That love could be the only way,
or all is lost of life,
Everlasting life,
For life is love,
And love is life.

Turn my collar to the wind

Tired of the grief and the strife
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife

She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living

Elvis Presley,"When I was a lad
And old Shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old Shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and then pulled me out

As the years fast did roll
Old Shep, he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
""I can do no more for him, Jim""

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it, I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

He came to my side and looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

Old Shep, he has gone where the good doggies go
And no more with old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven there's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home",Old Shep [Alternate Take][#],1992

Elvis Presley,"Well, I quit my job down at the car wash
Left my mama a goodbye note
By sundown I'd left Kingston
With my guitar under my coat
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
For the next three weeks I went huntin' them nights
Just lookin' for a place to play
Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man
Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis
I run outta money and luck
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia
On a overloaded poultry truck
I thumbed on down to Panama City
Started pickin' out some o'them all night bars
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar
Makin' music on my guitar
I got the same old story at them all night piers
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man
We don't need a guitar man, son
So I slept in the hobo jungles
Roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama
At a club they call Big Jack's
A little four-piece band was jammin'
So I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed 'em what a band would sound like
With a swingin' little guitar man
Show 'em, son
If you ever take a trip down to the ocean
Find yourself down around Mobile
Make it on out to a club called Jack's
If you got a little time to kill
Just follow that crowd of people
You'll wind up out on his dance floor
Diggin' the finest little five-piece group
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico
Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band
Well, wouldn't ya know, it's that swingin' little guitar man",Guitar Man/What'd I Say [Original Unedited Master][#],1993

I reached out one night and you were gone
Don't know why you'd run
What you're running to or from

So I'm walking in the rain
Thumbing for a ride
On this lonely Kentucky back road
I've loved you much too long
My love's too strong
To let you go, never knowing
What went wrong
Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town that I'll go walking through

With the rain in my shoes (rain in my shoes)
Searchin' for you
In the cold Kentucky rain

Showed your photograph
To some old gray-bearded men
Sitting on a bench outside a gen'ral store
They said ""yes, she's been here""
But their memory wasn't clear
Was it yesterday?
No, wait, the day before?

Finally got a ride
With a preacher man who asked
""Where you bound on such a cold dark afternoon?""
As we drove on through the rain
As he listened, I explained
And he left me with a prayer
That I'd find you

I'm just a smokey mountain boy
Come back to the hills i love
Where the tops of pine all bend in the wind
And the deep blue sky above

The closer and closer i get to home
The more excited i am
Those were the mornings i'd roll out of bed
Start the day off with a hot corn bread
Smothered in huckleberry jam

I can almost hear the hounds running through the woods
Close on the trail of the hare
How i long to be with them following the hounds
A-huntin' again
Gettin' me a big old grizzly bear

No matter how many i see
I left some pretty ones behind

The winding streams and the winds that blow
Ask me ""how can you stay away""

Left my mama a goodbye note,
By sundown I'd left Kingston,
With my guitar under my coat,
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis,
Got a room at the YMCA,
For the next three weeks I went huntin' them nights,
Just lookin' for a place to play,
Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire,
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man.
Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis,
I run outta money and luck,
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia,
On a overloaded poultry truck,
I thumbed on down to Panama City,
Started pickin' out some o' them all night bars,
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar,
Makin' music on my guitar,
I got the same old story at them all night piers,
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man
We don't need a guitar man, son
So I slept in the hobo jungles,
Roamed a thousand miles of track,
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama,
At a club they call Big Jack's,
A little four-piece band was jammin',
So I took my guitar and I sat in,
I showed 'em what a band would sound like,
With a swingin' little guitar man.
Show 'em, son
If you ever take a trip down to the ocean,
Find yourself down around Mobile,
Make it on out to a club called Jack's,
If you got a little time to kill,
Just follow that crowd of people,
You'll wind up out on his dance floor,
Diggin' the finest little five-piece group,
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico,

I write I'm sorry but my letter keeps coming back.

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

Left my mama a goodbye note
By sundown I'd left Kingston
With my guitar under my coat
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
For the next three weeks I went huntin' them nights
Just lookin' for a place to play
Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man

Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis
I run outta money and luck
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia
On a overloaded poultry truck
I thumbed on down to Panama City
Started pickin' out some o' them all night bars
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar
Makin' music on my guitar
I got the same old story at them all night piers
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man
We don't need a guitar man, son

So I slept in the hobo jungles
Roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama
At a club they call Big Jack's
A little four-piece band was jammin'
So I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed 'em what a band would sound like
With a swingin' little guitar man
Show 'em, son

If you ever take a trip down to the ocean
Find yourself down around Mobile
Make it on out to a club called Jack's
If you got a little time to kill
Just follow that crowd of people
You'll wind up out on his dance floor

Up and down the Gulf of Mexico

And a dozen towns ago
I reached out one night 
And you were gone
Don't know why you'd run, 
What you're running to or from
All I know is I want to bring you home

So I'm walking in the rain, 
Thumbing for a ride
On this lonely Kentucky back road
I've loved you much too long
And my love's too strong
To let you go, never knowing
What went wrong
Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town
That I'll go walking through

With the rain in my shoes,
Searchin' for you
In the cold Kentucky rain,
In the cold Kentucky rain
Showed your photograph
To some old gray bearded man

Sitting on a bench
Outside a gen'ral store
They said ""Yes, she's been here""
But their memory wasn't clear

Was it yesterday,
No, wait the day before
So I fin'ly got a ride
With a preacher man who asked
""Where you bound on such a cold dark afternoon?""

As he listened I explained
And he left me with a prayer
That I'd find you",Kentucky Rain [Take 9],2001

The prettiest green eyes anywhere
And Marie's the name of his latest flame

I wished him luck and then he said goodbye

She'd be mine eternally

I roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama

I showed 'em what a band would sound like

I've been running all the way 
Baby, trying to get to you

Ever since I read your letter 
Where you said you loved me true 
I've been traveling night and day 
I've been running all the way 
Baby, trying to get to you 

When I read your loving letter 
Then my heart began to sing 
There were many miles between us
But they didn't mean a thing

I just had to reach you, baby
In spite of all that I've been through
I kept traveling night and day
I kept running all the way
Baby, trying to get to you

Well, if I had to do it over 
That's exactly what I'd do
I would travel night and day
And I'd still run all the way
Baby, trying to get to you

Well, there's nothing that could hold me 
Or that could keep me away from you 
When your loving letter told me 
That you really loved me true

When my way was dark as night
He would shine His brightest light

Why her mom and dad are not together

Than go on living without you
