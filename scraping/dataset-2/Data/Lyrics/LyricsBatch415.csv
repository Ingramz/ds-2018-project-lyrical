Javier,"Hello... are you still there?
This long silence is more than I can bear
I know it seems we ain't got much to say 
But can you try to hear me out anyway?

This space between us just keeps on growing
We both know where we been,
But that ain't where we're going
I can see it in your eyes, girl, that you're wonderin'
Will our love still stand the test?

The answer is yes... Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes), Yes
The answer is yes... Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes), Yes 

Hold on, you're breaking up
There's so much static between the two of us
You say I'm trippin', I say you've changed
Maybe we both need to stop playing these silly games

We gotta open up and tell the truth
Just be real with me and I promise I'll be real with you
If you're still wondering if I'll be there when you need me girl, 
You'll never have to guess

The answer is yes... Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes), Yes
The answer is yes... Yes, (Yes) Yes, (Yes) Yes

Will I hear you call? (Yes)
Catch you when you fall? (Yes)
The answer is yes!
Will I always care? (Yes)
Will I still be there? (yes)

I could write a thousand songs for you, I'd still be short a word or two
As the years go on, will my love stay strong?
Will I be there to give you my best?

Yes! Yes... Yes... Yes
The answer is yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

Will I still be the one (Yes!) when it's all said and done... (Yes!)
Will my love for you stay strong?
Will we stand the test, 'til our very last breath? (Yes!)
Will I be there as the years go on? (Yes!)

Yes! 
Oh, yes!",The Answer Is Yes,2006
Javier,"I knew you were different from the way you smiled
When you walked by
You was sexy as hell and somehow I can tell that
You was kinda shy

I seen you before
But I been waitin' for the right time
To tell you all the things
That have been running through my mind

Do you have some one to call your own?
Do you have some one waitin' by the phone?
Do you have some one you've been thinkin' of?
But guess what I got to know is there some one you really love?
(If not then)

I wanna talk to you
Get to know the things you like to do
I've been searchin' for a special girl
And it could be you

'Cause in all my dreams I see you and me
And that's the truth
So before you go I just got to know
Can I talk to you yeah

If you don't mind
I've got a few things id like to ask you
When your alone or with your friends
What other kind of things you like to do?

What's your favorite song?
Ain't that the one that's on your ringtone
If I asked you out right now
Would you say yes or would you tell me no?

Do you have some one to call your own?
Do you have some one waitin' by the phone?
Do you have some one you've been thinkin' of?
But guess what I got to know is there some one you really love?

",Can I Talk to You,2006
Javier,"Let me play you something
To make you keep your body moving
Winding, keeping my attention
Girl if I keep playin' will you keep
Doin' what you doin' ooh wee
So much more than sexy
(she's inspiration) every twist of you waist
Makes the chord that I play (change)
Like you're controlling me (strange)
(infatuation) started to kick in
I wanna strum you like this guitar in my hands but for now I wanna watch you

[Chorus:]
Dance for me 'cause you know you're gonna wind up coming
Home with me but for now baby wanna watch you
Dance for me, dance for me, just let me
Later we'll be makin' love 
But for now girl just dance for me

Let me play you something
(enticing keep you wanting)
This here strumming stroking your imagination
(your imagination)
When we take this to the crib
Let the music take your inhibitions
(willfully) but for now just dance for me

(she's inspiration)
Every twist of your waist
Makes the chord that I play (change)
Like you're controlling me (strange)
(infatuation) started to kick in
I wanna strum you like this guitar in my hands but for now I wanna watch you

[Chorus:]

Oh its so (hard to concentrate)
Girl you're making it hard for me
I can't take my eyes away
Senorita, like to meet you
Maybe after I'm through
You know what I wanna do later on
I wanna watch you

[Chorus:]",Dance for Me,2006
Javier,"Have you ever had a woman
That commands your attention
When she?s in your presence
And Lord her beauty
Belongs on every page inside of the Essence
She?ll make you blow your cool
Like summer time in a 69 Buick
And the crazy thing about it
I love when she do it
Can somebody tell me

[Chorus]
Is this love I don?t know
I don?t wanna let it go
But I know it feels good to me
Is this love I?m not sure cause
I don?t don?t know the symptoms for it
But I know it feels good to me

Every time she comes around my emotions are so aroused
And if I could I would get with her now
Please forgive me for speakin? out loud but
When she gets close to me
She puts my mind on freeze
To the point I can hardly speak
Can somebody tell me please

[Chorus]

Can someone please tell me
Is this how loves supposed to be
Cause I like it and it feels so good to me
Can someone please tell me
Is this how loves supposed to feel
Cause I like it and loved it when she?s here

[Chorus]",Is This Love,2006
Javier,"Maybe it's your eye, girl
It's something 'bout the way they shine
Maybe it's the feeling
Of your skin pressed up against mine

Maybe it's the taste of your lips
Or the sway of your hips that makes me stay a long
I really can't tell you what it is
But I'm about to lose control

Now I know you can have any man
And I'll never take you for granted
So let go, whatever you need
Girl, you know you can have it

Let me count the ways I'm feeling you
Sometimes it's the little things you do
The way you lick your lips and call me, Boo
Girl, it's so amazing, I just can't explain it

Let me count the ways you turn me on
For when I crave your body when your gone
So I put these words into a song 'cause I had to say it
Girl, I bless the day that your mama made you

Maybe it's the way every head turns
When you walk in, yeah
Maybe it's that when you smile I see
The cutest dimples in on your chin

Baby, 'cause your love is so unreal
The way it makes me feel, I can't get enough
And baby, it's the way you breath a sigh of relief
When you see I'm still there when you wake up

I know you can have any man
And I never take you for granted
Just let go, whatever you need
Girl, you know you can have it

Let me count the ways I'm feeling you
Sometimes it's the little things you do
The way you lick your lips and call me, Boo
Girl, it's so amazing, I just can't explain it

Let me count the ways you turn me on
For when I crave your body when your gone
So I put these words into a song 'cause I got to say it
Girl, I bless the day that your mama made you

It's the taste of your lips, the sway of your hips
It's the that you move when I touch you like this
It's the way that you smile, your sex appeal, your style
Don't stop what you're doing 'cause you're driving me wild

Now I know you can have any man
And I never take you for granted
Just let go, whatever you need
You know you can have it

Let me count the ways I'm feeling you
Sometimes it's the little things you do
The way you lick your lips and call me Boo
Girl, it's so amazing I just can't explain it

Let me count the ways you turn me on
The way I crave your body when your gone

Javier,"Lately I've been feeling the pressure, babe
Of trying to find a way I could get ya, hey
Now normally I won't be the type to sweat ya
But when you're with me feels like a hundred degrees

Yeah, now every time we have conversations, babe
We seem to run into complications, hey
You keep talking 'bout both our situations
But all I really see is we both know what we need

So baby, let me tell you

Many girls have come and gone
But through it all I know for sure
That

[Chorus]
You're the one I want
You're the one I need
You're the one I want
You're the one I need

Many girls have come and gone
But through it all I know for sure
That

[Chorus]

You and I both know we can perfect, hey
We should give it a try 'cause it's worth it, babe
Come on stop playing 'cause you know damn well we deserve it
You need to stop fronting, you might just end up with nothing, yeah

'Cause on the real your actions
Just don't make sense in me to go on
But you feel so you can kill your questions
The sea is deeper than the physical
More like the most spiritual, pitiful of our life time

Give, our love a try

Many girls have come and gone
But through it all I know for sure
That

[Chorus]

Many girls have come and gone
But through it all I know for sure
That

[Chorus]

Wait a minute now, are you trying to fight me?
I really know you want me, babe
Tell me what you're so afraid of?
Scared you're gonna fall in love

Don't hesitate in letting good things slip away
Better act now before it be too late
Now act, don't play again, play myself
But as it's just that you give it a try so, baby

Baby, give our love a try
Put your worries and your fears aside
Oh baby, give our love a try
Put your worries and your fears aside

Oh baby, give our love a try
Put your worries and your fears aside

Javier Alvarez,"You keep saying you got something for me
Something you call love but confess
You've been a'messin' where you shouldn't 've been a'messin'
And now someone else is getting all your best
Well, these boots are made for walking, and that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
You keep lyin' when you oughta be truthin'
You keep losing when you oughta not bet
You keep samin' when you oughta be a'changin'

One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
You keep playing where you shouldn't be playing
And you keep thinking that you'll never get burnt,hah

Javier Alvarez,"See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Sleight of hand and
twist of fate
On a bed of nails
she makes me wait
And I wait... without you
With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm,
we reach the shore
You gave it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you...

Javier Alvarez,"Esta víctima llegó con su más linda diadema
Para retirarse el pelo y dar su cara de pena
Su destino se torció y ella prefiere dormirse
Con las piernas bien dobladas sin nunca jamás re{irse

Y las amigas juegan a tula, y ella las mira sin conocerlas
Sus dos pupilas se le derriten y el corazón se marcha a la guerra

Muñequita sin tesón, poca gracia y sin madera
Mucho eccema, poco afecto, y un papá que le pegó
Sus paredes son sin sol, y ella prefiere dormirse
Y soñar todos los rayos para hacer una canción

A sus amigas poder cantarla y compartirla sin pedir nada
Ellas se burlan, se van con chicos y se cuestiona el precio del alma

El domingo va a vender toda su vida en el rastro
Y casi todas las noches va comprando su morir
Aprendido a contener, el amor se inyecta en vena
Y una tarde de diciembre dice adiós sin despedir

A sus amigas, ya todas quietas, al parque roto y al cuento de hadas
A las sirenas de policía y a un sueño loco que le robaban",Amor en Vena,2005
Javier Alvarez,"Afuera el frío arruga la ciudad
Y el tiempo sólo existe para los que están
Deben ser cuatrocientos años los que se van
Las manos son ya ciegas de planchar un plan

Sueño con escapar de este berenjenal
Y el mar sólo lo vi en ""de aquí a la eternidad""

La encontraron dormida en una rama
La encontraron perdida en una plaza
La encontraron dormida y con el alma lejos,
Volando lejos

Asola el pensamiento la agonía de pensar
Pensar en tantos valses que pude bailar
Domestiqué una culpa por soñar tan mal
Con príncipes que no temieran naufragar

Sueño con escapar de este berenjenal
Y adentro sufro sola, por no saber gritar

La encontraron
Tengo el presentimiento de alguna verdad
Se agolpa en el recuerdo que futuro no hay
Los ojos se me cierran y aún he de limpiar
Mañana dulcemente tengo que acabar

De tejer el ayer, recorrer un mantel
Poblado de unos niños que yo amamanté

La encontraron
La princesa se fue su sonrisa mostró
El cuerpo un poco mustio de zurcir tanto el amor

La encontraron",De Aqui a La Eternidad,2005
Javier Alvarez,"Aquí a esta hora, en este bar
Las seis, seis why media why tú no estás
Ya ves, ya lo sabes, es la edad
No sé todos dicen que es normal

Normal que ahora tiemble, normal que no sepa
Normal que te esté echando de menos,
Conviriténdote en canción
Normal que me encienda, normal que me apague
Normal que me pierda en este credo
Para no aferrarme a dios

Así nuestra historia, why en mi mal
Sin mí, sin amigos, sin el mar
Reloj, otro whisky al lacrimal
Ya sé, pensarías que es normal

Normal
Normal que esté borracho, normal que sienta miedo
Normal que me despierte del sueño en otro cuerpo

Normal",Credo,2005
Javier Alvarez,"Antes eran otros tiempos, se querían las mocitas, los mocitos
Tutearse no era fácil, ni saltarse a la torera alguna norma de corrido
Qué de chuzos han caído, cuántas veces nos hemos arrepentido
De medir tanto las cosas y agachar la calva ante el amor comprometido

En esta casa tuya y mía es como si hubiesen vivido dos fantasmas de otro siglo
Nos hemos hecho comodísimos y todo nos parece lo normal o lo indebido
La confianza y nuestros cuerpos se han dormido por haber dejado abandonado el ritmo
Y en nuestra habitación, dentro de algún cajón sueña el amor

Sesenta años y cuarenta de ellos cenando en la misma mesa
A veces pienso en si la gente contará todos sus días como estando en esta celda
Que aunque los dos nos fabricamos poco a poco y perfumamos muy coqueta,
Terminó siendo un mar continuo de peleas con bastantes dosis de esta indiferencia

En esta casa tuya y mía es como si hubiesen vivido dos fantasmas de otro siglo
Nos hemos hecho comodísimos y todo nos parece lo normal o lo indebido
La confianza y nuestros cuerpos se han dormido por haber dejado abandonado el ritmo
Y en nuestra habitación, dentro de algún cajón viaja el amor

En esta casa tuya y mía es como si hubiesen vivido dos fantasmas

Javier Alvarez,"La luna silba nos da su menta y baila claqué
La luna chula nos salva siempre con su pincel
La luna calla si está dolida por no callar
La luna sabia, esa que mira sin perdonar
La luna sabe lo que me ocurre en esta ciudad
La luna trata de que la amemos sin rechistar

La luna, más bruja que bruja
Nos teje una tela que vuela y se va
Luna, más loca que loca
Borracha de almíbar y erizos de mar

La luna troca todos los cromos que ayer pegué
Me tiene preso soy siempre lo que me dicta ser
La luna sale corre desnuda y después se va
El sol le trova todas sus puestas, y ella ni hablar

La luna, más bruja que bruja
Nos teje una tela que vuela y se va
Luna, más loca que loca
Borracha de anises y erizos de mar

La luna llora en todos los ríos del mapa azul
La luna pocha se queja un poco de su salud
La luna lucha por esta tierra que está a sus pies
En fin, se ríe, escurre el ojo y quita la sed

Luna de menta silba al oído y baila claqué
La luna guapa nos salva siempre en vuelta en su red",Luna de Menta,2005
Javier Alvarez,"No tengo orgullo ni furia al pasar
Pero hubo rabia en algún que otro andar
Hay cicatrices de no comprender
Ya se haré tarde, me piro a las tres

Me escondí tantas veces creyendo ser yo
Que olvidé que mi sitio no lo dicta un señor
No le veo sentido a luchar por luchar
Ni a estrujar tanto el coco y llamarlo pensar

Miss universo soñé ser una vez
Faldas cortitas, apretado corsé
Me sigo pintando sin ningún afán
Si me tocas el culo, te capo chaval

Se acabaron las ganas de hablar y suplicar
Me ha llegado la hora de buscar mi lugar
No le veo sentido a sólo dar de mamar
Transparente me siento y aún parezco flotar

Hay todo un mundo nuevo como una flor
Ni soy estrecha ni hoy pienso follar
Lo siento macho deja de engatusar

Javier Alvarez,"Voy castellana abajo en plena primavera
Mucho árbol, noche, coches y neón la sangre alteran
Dejo atrás Castelar, me ciegan las esferas
De tías que eran tíos aunque ya no lo parezca

Una es más solitaria mostrando sus tetas
Y hay un palpable riesgo en toda cosa que maneja
Se para un auto con dos chicos en bandeja,
Que empiezan a insultar la seriedad que desempeña

Y meten primera, ella casi ríe
Me regala sus ojos que parecen decirme
Muerdo por fuera, me como por dentro
Piel de pantera, soy virgen del miedo
Noche en la acera, mañana sin centro
Luz por montera, sin un firmamento

Tiene pelotas que quien pasa más vergüenza
Tenga que combinarla con el frío y con la entrega
Parece broma que se escondan los que muestran
Y nos toque aprender de quienes todo se reservan

El siglo veinte se nos va ya de las manos
Y el mundo es un gran puzzle de riñones infrahumanos
Hombres de misa por la noche santiguados
Dan caza a la pantera y ponen a lavar sus manos",Piel de Pantera,2005
Javier Andreu,"Dejaré mi tierra por fin
Dejaré mis campos y me iré
Lejos de aquí
Cruzaré llorando el jardín
y con tus recuerdos partiré lejos de aquí

De día viviré pensando en tus sonrisas
De noche las estrellas me acompañarán
Serás como una luz que alumbre mi camino
Me voy pero te juro que mañana volveré

Al partir un beso y una flor
Un te quiero una caricia y un adiós
Es ligero equipaje
Para un tan largo viaje
Las penas pesan en el corazón

Más allá del mar habrá un lugar
Donde el sol cada mañana brille más
Forjarán mi destino
Las piedras del camino

Quería cantarte la canción más bella un ramo da abrazo que te dejara huella 
El beso único de todo el jardín de pétalos perfecto es su textil
La confección más fina de mi pluma enaltecida por la flor que solo existe por la luna 
Un tema tallado por una orquídea que esperaba de su amado en la colina

Cuando entraste al bar y te caíste al piso,
Me tiraste el pingüino, me tiraste el sifón,
Estallaron los vidrios de mi corazón

Te vi bailar, brillando con tu ausencia

Te burlaste de todos, te reíste de mí

Javier Calamaro,"Tuve un problema de difícil solución
En una época difícil de mi vida
Estaba entre la espada y la pared
Y aguantando la opinión de mi familia
Yo no quería una vida normal
No me gustaban los horarios de oficina
Mi espíritu rebelde se reía
Del dinero, del lujo y el comfort
Y tuve una revelación
Ya se que quiero en esta vida
Voy a seguir mi vocación
Será la música mi techo y mi comida

Porque yo
No quiero trabajar
No quiero ir a estudiar
No me quiero casar
Quiero tocar la guitarra todo el día
Y que la gente se enamore de mi voz
Porque yo
No quiero trabajar
No quiero ir a estudiar
No me quiero casar
Y en la cabeza tenia
La voz de mi viejo
Que me sonaba como
Un rulo de tambor
Vos

Mejor que te afeites
Mejor que madures, mejor que labores
Ya me cansé de que me tomes la cerveza
Te voy a dar con la guitarra en la cabeza
Vos
Mejor que te afeites
Mejor que madures, mejor que labores
Ya me cansé de ser tu fuente de dinero
Voy a ponerte esa guitarra de sombrero

Javier Calamaro,"Rara
Como encendida
Te hallé bebiendo
Linda y fatal.

Bebías
Y en el fragor del champagne
Loca reías
Por no llorar.

Pena
Me dio encontrarte
Pues al mirarte
Yo vi brillar tus ojos
Con un eléctrico ardor
Tus bellos ojos que tanto adoré.

Esta noche
Amiga mía
El alcohol nos ha embriagado
Que me importa que se rían
Y nos llamen los mareados

Cada cual tiene sus penas
Y nosotros las tenemos
Esta noche beberemos
Porque ya no volveremos
A vernos más.

Hoy vas a entrar en mi pasado
En el pasado de mi vida
Tres cosas lleva el alma herida
Amor, pesar, dolor.

Hoy vas a entrar en mi pasado
Hoy nuevas sendas tomaremos
Qué grande ha sido nuestro amor
Y sin embargo, ay, mira lo que quedó.",Los Mareados,2005
Javier Calamaro,"Hare calor, hare calor, 
Yo estaba esperando que cantes mi canción, 
Why que abras esa botella, why brindemos por ella
Why hagamos el amor en el balcón. 

Mi corazón, mi corazón
Es un músculo sano pero necesita acción. 
Dame paz why dame guerra, why un dulce colocón
Why yo te entregaré lo mejor. 

Ah, haa ha, ah, haa ha, 
Dulce como el vino, salada como el mar, 
Princesa why vagabunda, garganta profunda, 
Sálvame de esta soledad. 

Hare calor, hare calor, 
Ella tiene la receta para estar mucho mejor. 
Sin truco, sin prisa, me entrega su sonrisa
Como una sacerdotisa del amor. 

Luna de miel, luna de papel, 
Luna llena, piel canela, dame noches de placer. 
A veces estoy mal, a veces estoy bien, 
Te daré mi corazón para que juegues con él. 

Ah, ha ha, ah, haa ha, 
Podrían acusarme, ella es menor de edad. 
Iremos a un hotel, iremos a cenar, 
Pero nunca iremos juntos al altar.

Javier Calamaro,"Larga muchacho tu voz joven
Como larga la luz el sol
Que aunque tenga que estrellarse
Contra un paredón
Que aunque tenga que estrellarse
Se dividirá en dos

Suelta muchacho tus pensamientos
Como anda suelto el viento
Sos la esperanza y la voz que vendrá
A florecer en la nueva tierra

Hombres de hierro que no escuchan la voz
Hombres de hierro que no escuchan el grito
Hombres de hierro que no escuchan el llanto
Gente que avanza se puede matar
Pero los pensamientos quedarán

A cambio de las armas su cabeza

Javier Calamaro y Su Orquesta Pirata,"Lástima, bandoneón, mi corazón
Tú ronca maldición maleva
Tu lágrima de ron me lleva
Hasta el hondo, bajo fondo
Donde el barro se subleva

Ya sé no me digas tenéis razón
La vida es una herida absurda
Y es todo, todo, tan fugaz
Que es una curda nada más
Mi confesión

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
¿No ves la pena
Que me ha herido?

Y háblame simplemente
De aquel amor ausente
Tras un retazo del olvido
Ya sé que me haces daño

Yo sé que te lastimo
Llorando mi sermón de vino
Pero es el viejo amor
Que tiembla, bandoneón

Y busca en un licor que aturda
La curda que al final
Termine la función
Corriéndole un telón al corazón

Un poco de recuerdo y sinsabor
Gotea tu rezongo lerdo
Marea tu licor y arrea
La tropilla de la zurda
Al volcar la ultima curda

Cerrarme el ventanal
Que arrastra el sol
Su lento caracol de sueño
¿No ves que vengo de un país
Que está de olvido
Siempre gris, tras el alcohol?

Javier Colina,"Your green eyes with their soft lights,
Your eyes that promise sweet nights,
Bring to my soul a longing, a thirst for love devine.
In dreams I seem to hold you, to find you and enfold you,
Our lips meet and our hearts, too, with a thrill so sublime

Those cool and limpid green eyes -
A pool wherein my love lies.

So deep that in my searching for happiness
I fear that they will ever haunt me,
All through my life they'll taunt me
But will they ever want me?
Green eyes, make my dreams come true.

Green eyes with their soft lights
And eyes that promise sweet nights

And I don't have to ask myself why
It's as clear as the October sky

And your words once so sweet, now they fall incomplete
And they're no longer speaking to me
When will I shed my grief for a moments relief

For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
Oh a beautiful release
Memory seeps from my veins
Let me be empty
Oh and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight life
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
The storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time
It's easier to believe
In this sweet madness oh
This glorious sadness that brings me to my knees

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here

It was only you and me

I would pretend that you were my queen

We don't need nothing as long as we got love
Believe it, I mean it, I know we'll always have enough

And I just have to ask
Baby what's all the cloak and dagger for

Okay here's the truth
I ran out of gas
& I didn't call cause I thought you'd be mad
So I started to walk
Took an hour and a half
To get off that highway and fill up that can
I was hoping that you'd understand

She's getting good with the lies
So good that you wondered
If the rabbit in the hat tricks for real
She turns water into wine
And I'd almost believed her
If her eyes just for once could keep still

Now my patience wasting
Cause she's late once again
Honey tell me what delayed you this time

Okay here's the truth
It's gonna sound kind of strange

It started out fine
Til I got to Route 9
When an hour away before I realized
I'm sorry I ruined all our plans
I was hoping that you'd understand

And there watching her secretly talking
It is just about all I can bear
Now I know why she's been wearing
Make-up and caring
So much about changing her hair

The telephone vibrates on the table again
Another damn private call coming through
And now she's visibly shaking
And I just feel like taking that phone
Throwing it clear across the room

She answers “hello”
A mans voice I don't know
Says “it's time that you tell him the truth”
Now I can't take this no more
Honey I'm out the door
No, I won't relax
I got my suitcase all packed
What she said next stopped me dead in my trust

It's not what you think

I'm sorry I lied
To you all of those times
I didn't know how to tell you
I might not survive

I wanted what's best for you and the kids

Javier Colon,"When I was a young boy growing up in school
There was a lot of confusion so many guides and rules
Faced with a dilemma and being told what to do
That’s when I learned to stand for something, does it come as a surprise
That I fell, fell for you, for once I could tell what I should do

Lock this baby down, make it real here's the papers sign the deal
Find a home buy a car get a dog and there we are
So I'm gonna stand up and man up, no stuttering and I won't stall
I'm gonna stand up and man up, the one time its cool to fall
In love, I'm falling in love
And please don't pick me up

We decided to get married, a little bit too soon
People told us we were crazy, 'cause we were still in school
Too young too fall in love, but we followed through
And it wasn’t all for nothing
So they shouldn't be surprised
That I fell, fell for you and for twice I could tell what I should do

Lock this baby up, make it real here's the papers sign the deal
Find a home buy a car buy a dog and there we are
So I'm gonna stand up and man up, throw my doubts up against the wall
I'm gonna stand up and man up, the one time its cool to fall
In love, oh I'm in love
But please don't pick me up

You’d never leave me on the side of the road
Or down on the floor like your clothes
Driveway with the water hose anywhere the water flows that’s perfect how it goes
Just like a penny on the street or dying when you see something sweet.
The most beautiful picture on the wall, that's you

'Cause when I fell, I fell for you
And for the thrice time I could tell what I needed to do

Lock this baby down make it real where's the papers sign the deal
Find a home buy a car buy a dog and there we are
So I'm gone stand up and man up, I promise not to drop the ball
I'm gonna stand up and man up, the one time its cool to fall
So I'm gonna stand up and man up, who cares how it looks to y'all
I'm gonna stand up and man up, the one time its cool to fall
In Love, ooh in love
Hey but please don't pick me up.",Stand Up,2011

For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference

My favorite winter coat

With not enough to eat

A selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me

A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed out dream

What you say, without words
Resuscitates what was numb inside

Javier Colon,"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick, and think of you
Caught up in circles confusion is nothing new
Flashback warm nights almost left behind
Suitcases of memories, time after

Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear
What you've said
Then you said go slow
I fall behind the second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you-I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you-I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows you're wondering if I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside the drum beats out of time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you-I'll be waiting

But when I looked down
I was standing on my knees
Now I need someone to help me
Someone to help me please

Baby if you need me
Like I know I need you
There's just one thing
I'll ask you to do
Take my hand and lead me
To the hole in your garden wall
And pull me through",Your Bright Baby Blues,2010
Javier Mendoza,"Miles away from lands unseen
He crossed the ocean to be where he'd always dreamed
Drinking wine under the sun
Philosophizing until the day turned into dawn
And now I miss him but I know he'll write one day

Is it your time, is it your fate
Will you love now, will you be late
Can you live for yourself
Can you

Take it as far as you want to

She took one bag and left alone
To find the peace she had never known
She broke a vow she couldn't believe
And now she's with her and feeling so free
And now I miss her but she did what she said she would

Is it your time, is it your fate
Will you love now
Will you be late
Can you live for yourself
Can you

Take it as far as you want to

Do you think it's time
Can I wait again
Til the time is right, til I'm free of sin
Have I lost my chance or just my drive
Am I just afraid to fail inside
Got to break the pattern that pulls me in
Got to focus on the life within
Will you call me coward if I don't try
But if I do will you go and hide

Can you walk on water
If you set your mind
Can you heal the sick
Turn blood into wine
Can you love another without condition
Until the love reaches its fruition
Can you take it
Can you take it
Can you

Take it as far as you want to",Take It,2000
Javier Mendoza,"Can you hear me now
The voices in my head speak out loud
My world is spinning and I keep dreaming
As I fall to the ground

Can you lift me up
My feet keep digging in the mud
My mind is swimming but I'm not quitting
Until my eyes are shut

The sun keeps hiding behind the clouds
As you keep your distance behind your frown
I've climbed the mountain to find it all
But I keep on searching while

I'm waiting for the sun
I'm waiting for the rain to fall
I'm waiting without reason
I'm waiting for your call

Si me oyes levántame
Las voces en mi cabeza ya no oyen
Mi mundo da mil vueltas why mi mente sigue suelta
Al caer me unden

Detrás de la nube se esconde el sol
Tu frunces el ceño ocultando el valor
Sigo escalando sin encontrar
Pero seguiré buscando mientras

I'm waiting for the sun
Espero al sol que salga
Waiting for the rain to fall
Espero a la lluvia que caiga
Waiting without reason
Espero sin razón
I'm waiting for your call
Espero hasta que oiga tu voz

Am I chasing an empty voice?
Am I just trying to fill a void
Sólo persigo una voz vacia
O tan sólo lleno un alma caida",Waiting,2000
Javier Mendoza,"Hey girl, do you have time?
Can we sneak off somewhere and have a talk?
'Cause I've got things I've got to get off my chest
Something's you may not have heard yet, oh baby

And you would be the last breath that I breathe

Javier Mendoza,"She visits the stars
Even the ones that have been known to fall
She hangs out on Mars
But usually takes the time out to call
Now that she's so far away
And her sins are stuck in the ground
There is no more time of day
And the night time never rolls around 'cause

She lives in the sky
Doesn't know why
They'd ever want her to come back down back to her pain
No one knows her name
Or even noticed she wasn't around

She used to daydream
About the way the clouds would move
And how they'd seem
To be the friend she never knew
Now that she's so far away
And her sins are stuck in the ground
There is no more time of day
And the night time never rolls around 'cause

She never wanted to change the world
Or even to change their minds

She'd be falling on the wrong side of the rain",She,2002

Javier Rosas,"Tres convoy equipados interrumpieron la boda 
No eran invitados ni parientes de la novia 
Marinos camuflajeados con el color del desierto 
Al brindis llegaron al frente venia un sargento 
Tenemos rodeado el sitio se los digo es mejor que no se opongan 
Venimos por este tipo es El Chino alias Rodrigo Gamboa 

Eran demasiados como para hacerles frente 
Si queremos vivir hay que ser inteligentes 
Chango tu te quedas pa distraerlos un rato 
No levantes sospechas te espero rio abajo 
La gente asustada con las balas empezaron a correr 
Changuito esconde las armas de volada por debajo del pastel 

Un sargento andaba herido, pero del orgullo 
Díganle al mentado Chino ""que Sonora no es suyo"" 
Que ya no lo quiero vivo que arreglos no habrá ninguno 
El cinco dejo un recado ""soy el padre de los ántrax
Y también el tuyo"" 

Porque cuando uno es todo terreno
Lo que sobra son los caminos
Y la ruleta sigue girando con Javier Rosas
Puro Revolver Cannabis compadre

Con el manto de la noche El Chino se había escapado 
Dos kilómetros al norte caminaron sin descano 
Con los primos con El Monkey se aventaron a pie 
Había ruido de escorpiones, serpientes de cascabel 
Alguien vendrá a rescatarnos aguantemos yo se que vamos bien 
En Vicam pelean los yakis nos dan agua pa no morirnos de sed 

Ya pasaron dos horas hay que redoblar esfuerzos 
Quiero que peinen la zona no deben estar muy lejos 
Removieron cada piedra y no había rastro de ellos 
Otra vez El Chino se las aplico de nuevo 
Dos zapatos italianos encontraron tirados en la arena 
Eran del numero 5 son del Chino que maldita coincidencia 

Los guachos ya se fueron y a la fiesta regresamos 
Hizo coraje el sargento y así se quedo agüitado 
Anda El Chino con los primos y seguimos tomando

La misma hora de ayer, la misma esquina
Era joven y fiel, y aún tenía

Bajo de aquel farol, noche tras noche 
Veinte veces se la llevaron presa 
Y cantó su canción tras de las rejas

De balcón en balcón, de plaza en plaza

",La Celosa,1998
Javin Sun,"

I want you
I've seen your ways
Show yourself
Better than what you make believe

All I hear
Is the sound of sleep
Deafening
Comfort in the arms of sweet dreams

Now, this won't take long
We'll rise up again
And rewrite these wrongs

I won't do it
I've rushed you
Patiently
Guarding the life that you deceived

I've crawled for you
Or so they say
We rise to it
Fall again into the same dream

You won't have to wait long
They'll show up again
Make way for the fall

Wake up
There's blood in your sweat when you wake up
Cower, bloodsucking liar
Who you gonna call when you wake up?

See now
What you gonna see when you wake up?
Beg, you little fucking liar
Your head on this chopping board

If this is entertaining
I hope you enjoy the view

Wide awake
And still asleep
I'm failing this riddle in my head, I
I'm failing to get it
Can you say?
Honestly?
Wide awake
And still asleep

Don't leave this too long
(It won't take long)
Tomorrow will come
(Hang around)
You won't have to wait long
(We'll rise up again)
It's your day in the sun

They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again

Please wake up!!
Please wake up!!

The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that he's just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.
Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,

With money to spend
Some of us were born

That it's good for us to care
Some of us feel the icy wind

For those of us who tend the sick

Yeah what? 
Time for lyrical shanks to your gut 
Death to wack MC's 
First up is my nigga Lonnie be	 
First up to make it liver  I catch wreck like drunk drivers 
Been through many battles but I left no survivors 
So WHASSUP? Those that want a beef nigga bring it on 
Cause when I'm done  it'll be my dick that you're swingin on 
From the way I say my rap clear 
I make people more excited than a faggot that got a pap smear 
The crooked truth rap sensation, I ain't to be fucked with 
You better off practicin masturbation 
Line after line I bring excitement like a hooker 
So put rubbers on your ears, then diaphragms on your woofer 
as the rhyme buster, mic clutcher, from Richmond 
show the real definition of the word represent 

(SOUTHSIDE!) The place where I dwell so 
recog-NAS NAS NAS, that _It Ain't Hard to Tell_ 
who's the best, blessed with lyrical, context that kick 
Just like that little girl that got shot in +Fresh+ 
Word to momma, I'm hotter than that nigga with the bomber 
leather pants on, in hell holdin hands with Jeffrey Dahmer 
Yo, let me make this clear - I ain't the baddest rapper out there 
but I'ma take his place until he get here 



The sun shitter, hoarse all-star spitter 
More ? and asteroid transfixer 
Upchucks the medicine, chest of anguish 
In a fantasy, holy sign language 
I hit worlds, and my strange sperm gives birth 
to septuplet lady plants 
Check my tympanic titanic time pulse 
By the grace of the Immortal One 
I am the poisonous priest of fifty until the ?m'salaam? 
So every naked ape on Earth bow down in silence 
to the slumlord, of all universe reality 
Ironic supalism sodomizes your mentality 
Science super-mystics and futuristics join in wedlock 
So my freon cyrogenics make your head rot pop then bust 
from galactic cryathallic mechany mal ?? 


Preposterous, ice in my drop, yeah that's niggaz 
when I bend prisms and ride soundwaves in your eutrichula 
Malopropism is none, when I cerebrum wash in your brain pan 
Mixin ooze, your state of bein and attitude 
Petuitary shrinks, accepts it when 
I bite then flatten your head 
Richencypholic surgeon of my cosmorama, astrophysical 
Invades one, individual stands 
and uses cosmic radiation as a cosmetic 
to beautify inner fantastic, gory flow 
So, writing weak rhymes to your boomin system is no mo' 
when I induce arthritic rheumatism 
in dosages in sterile toxosins, ex-osmosis 
Infect the schlerois, of your trickanumerolagia 
Understand, who are you, to defend against, Mindbenda

Yo, umm, befo' I knock out yo' lies 
there is something you need to know 
Breakin mo' grounds than aftershocks from the earthquakes in San Fran' 
More determination than a bull, seein Redman 
Imagine, Technic glare +From Where???+ 
Competition say I gotta be display em in a photo album 
Disorganized has the other file 
Bein flamboyant like ? herbal user, slash, barracuda 
with key maneuvers like silent troopers of styles 
?? to split your wig and nip your eyebrows 
Go to space and greet the stars, huh 
Started chewin on the Milky Way, thought it was the candy bar 
You get the gong cause we niggaz do wrong 
and if you're young, and in love, do the moves of Michael Evens 
singin songs, big up to my peoples Northside 
Show the brotherhood, how I recognize 



I've been, detonatin equivalyrical exposives 
Rambo soldiers deep like the black trials of Moses 
Madness and wisdom accelerates my pendulum 
No attackin my forces of life, cause I got ten of em 
Dangerous, disciple killin images 
My warfare dreads be just like Nemesis 
Infiltrates, holy massacres like ?tnakarid? 
My religion break down prisons for missionaries 
In it to survive, so enlist, in strategies 
My non-exist thinkin only lead, to casualties 
I'm battlin, invadin, interceptin 
Makin sure don't nuttin move in your section 
Don't misinterpret my threats as just talk 
and the raise of a hand can make, worlds start haltin 
The almighty, leavin Gods and nations lost 
Cause when my shit hits I leave holes like sawed-offs 



Yo, it's the Mad child layin verses like tile 
Niggaz go impotent, when I kick these potent ass freestyles 
Wack MC's get mad and look at me hard 
Cause they used to be the shit, like McDonald's on Broad 
It's odd, how niggaz try to bomb 
Then I be fadin more motherfuckers than AIDS story harvest 
Throwin niggaz away like apple cores - I don't want to see shit 
but some hits and Ed McMahon at my front door 
I'm rippin tapes, niggaz still makin SHIT cakes 
Slippin down to fall off dudes tryin to get they shit straight 
I'm tryin to get paid troop -- I want more G's 
than a girl named GiGi gaggin on some gin and garlic glue 
Niggaz think they hype, but they ain't touchin these 
Their styles plaid out like stripe cuffed Lee's 
Please! In ninety-five, I'ma be straight 
Stealin MC's like DJ's be stealin milk crates 
Ask Dre, can't nobody hack it, they ill Dre? 
You get beheaded with a motherfuckin hatchet 
Haste makes waste and taste the bass 
When you see me - you don't see me get the FUCK out my face

Listen, now you gon' have to explain to me how the Lord love a little sinner like me
I've been over-stressin', I've been second guessin'
I was on them Xan's for a second, I was feelin' so defeated
I thought I was a leader
Hurt so many people, all I see is teardrops when I try to go to sleep
I heard you had a soft spot for the black sheep
Offer me forgiveness while I struggle to receive it
Now would you still love me if I took her home last night?
Smokin' and sippin' on that Patrón last night?
If I was poppin' pills tryna cop a thrill?
And I know I'm wrong but I do it 'cause it feels so right
Would I, would I still be a child?
And would you still be around?
If I'm sick of church and tired of prayin'?
It's been a while, I'm hopin' that you're patient

She put the blame all on herself (self)
She run into the arms of another man ('nother man)
And she done gave her heart to another man ('nother man)
She know she ain't the woman that she wanna be
Can't look in the mirror 'cause she don't see what she wanna see
She gave her love away too many times
Heard too many lies, she don't got no tears left to cry, yeah
Somewhere, she got a little child, but
She ain't see him in a while, now
She gave her baby to the system
Dealin' with her demons, she was fightin' her addiction
And this is all fact, not fiction
Prayin' that the Lord could really fix it
Said the last time was the last time
But the last time got her feelin' like the Devil's mistress, but listen

It's not easy, when you gotta face yourself
Truth is, I don't deserve not one bit of help
Promise that your lovin' never leave
Once you've seen all of me
It's just so hard to believe it all but for grace

wrapped in veils of sleep.
Caught in slumber's grasp,
nowhere that I should be.

No signs of relief
or payment for my pains.

I know that I must try to
break out of this cell I call my life.
To go to sleep is just to hide away.
I close my eyes so I won't
see the things I'd have to try to get.
I haven't tried I've only turned away.

In my sleeping world,
I thought that I was safe.
Free from all the pain
and burning light of day.
And even in my sleep now,
life is less than kind.
No escaping from
this madness in my mind.

Surprise, surprise
The boys are home
My gaurdian angel
Run down my telephone
The heats on, mister
Can't you hear them scream,
What ever happened to the teenage dream?
The curfew comesat the crack of night
The sad old wino
Aches to dissapate the fright
The jet jump jiver
Speeds past his machine, but
What ever happened to the teenage dream?
A broken god
From a musky world
Sweetly mouth touched
Him on its spur
His prison guards
Were very hard to clean, but
What ever happened to the teenage dream?
Do it, do it, do it to me babe
Do it to me babe, aha!
What ever happened to the teenage dream?
The wizard of oz,
And the bums and thieves
Ruled my girl
With tuetonic teeth
But all was lost
When her mouth turned green
What ever happened to the teenage dream?
Silver surfer
And the ragged kid
Are all sad and rusted
Ah, they don't have a gift
Believe me Pope Paul,my toes are clean
What ever happened to the teenage dream?
Black is black
And white is white
Some go to heaven
And some get it night
The bomb was a brute
But his winged screams......
What ever happened to the teenage dream?

Ain't it sad
And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me
That's too bad
In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball

Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
Aha aha
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
It's a rich man's world

A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me
That's too bad
So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same

Steady Mobb'n 

L.A. to the Bay  Atlanta GA 

Yeah 

That's the way we do it baby 

They never saw me coming 

Like a thief in the night 

Haven't you heard about it? 



New nigga in town  everybody listen 

I got a message for you  don't want you to miss it 

Gangstas make the world go round  as it was written 

That's why at every show  somebody trippin' 

So listen 



Now I like to smoke weed & drink straight yak 

And fuck wit dime pieces, because I got it like that 

Make all the strippers love me, because my tips stay fat 

And my 'Lac is all that 

Haven't you heard about it? 



1 - Got every ghetto in the country wantin' it 

Even if they playa hate, they bumpin' it 

(Can't live without it) 

I heard you're lookin' for that real life gangsta shit 

But they never saw me coming 

Haven't you heard about it? 



To all my niggas down south, I know what you like 

And all my peoples on the west, it's on tonight 

(Can't live without it) 

And everybody in the east, believe me 

Anybody talkin' beef, can eat these 

They never saw me coming 



We make the front page story in every city 

Couldn't believe all the niggas that was down wit me 

Had all these other bustas lookin' silly 

We don't ride no ponies, just roll on goldies 

Nigga please 



Come off that shit, this is a new era 

Straighten up your sideburns, stop wearin' mascara 

I hope it's for the sake of sellin' records 

Either way, you need to check yourself about bein' a real nigga 

So figure 



My momma told me I was unexplainable 

Said I was gifted, but I chose to act a fool 

And in the end, it be the fool that got me through 

Even back in school, I used to dream about it 



To have the whole world screamin', throwin' up their dubs 

Just want to give 'em what they needin', and show 'em love 

Truth is I'm a thug 

But I still can blow, so what 

So tell me the motha-fuckin' problem 

Haven't you heard about it? 



Repeat 1 



[Jay] 

??? face the fact 

Never thought, never knew I would come like that. 

No time to make a track 

Drunk off yak 

Still no excuse, for Mr. Magoo 

Some niggas want to trip off Tim-buck 2 

Pass me a blunt, I like to get blunted 

Never saw me comin' in a black 600 

Bump it like a bitch 

Got a twitch in da switch 

We oughtta know who major rich 

Sound like my son 

Better ride in this shit 

Learn to love these west coast hits 

Stop makin' tracks wit all the same kids 

Better close the deal 

Let's keep it on the real 

Never understood how you managed a deal 

Smashed up the town 

Got money by the pound

Haven't you heard about it?

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.

A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.

Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Jay & the Americans,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

I'm going to pick that rose 
And watch her as she grows in my garden

Some shit is better to keep to yourself than say aloud

A flight to the top, cop a one-way
But looking out the window of the subway, 16, slapping Mac Dre
Somehow I always knew it'd be that way
I felt tit so clear it's like a rode a time machine and I saw it
I paint the picture and draw it, I fold it up in my wallet
Keep it with me everywhere I go just as a reminder
Told myself every time I get discouraged or tired
I got greatness inside of me
I go against the grain 'til they tired of me
I've heard it all, nothing surprises me

I said, I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised, tomorrow or today

I'm still here, remember these lyrics
And when I'm dead and gone, I'll be there in spirit

Just pour some Rossi out, go ahead and tear it
One of a kind, no copy
Tell your grandchildren's children 'bout me
Tell 'em I was the illest
Let 'em know I spit the realest
Went from pennies and nickels to large amounts
Kept it in the hood, where it counts
Never was them, always was him
Had to prove myself, time and time again

So where I go from here?
I did the most you could possibly pack into a year
Now I can either fall off and completely disappear
Or, I can move up to the highest tier
Conversations with Gerald, standing in front the mirror
Ask myself like ""Fuck the bullshit, what you really fear?""
We all want to be understood, hope they hear us clear
Well, but that shit never happens everywhere
So I just do me on my ""fuck the world"" shit
I'm riding through the town listening to Earl's shit
Been trying to lift the Bay up, could probably curl it
I learn from the legends, they tell me ""you're it""
So I always maintain and try to stay sane
But, just do you, give a fuck what they sayin'
We artists are all alike, we feel the same pain
You want the whole world? We want the same thing

Not a real one, just a dream

Paradise to live

Know why I've been blue

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes

Jay Davis,"Sugar, sugar
She sits alone waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous avoiding all the questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking

If you want my body and you think i'm sexy
Come on sugar let me know.
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on honey tell me so
Tell me so baby

He's acting shy looking for an answer
Come on honey let's spend the night together
Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so i can phone my mother
They catch a cab to his high rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

Come on honey tell me so
If you really need me just reach out and touch me

Relax baby now we are alone

They wake at dawn ''cause all the birds are singing
Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinking
Outside it's cold, misty and it's raining
They got each other neither one's complaining
He say's i sorry but i'm out of milk and coffee

It's a yearnin' for my old back door

Goin' home, and I'm running' home, down the Gasoline Alley where I was born
 
When the weather's better and rails unfreeze
And the wind won't whistle 'round my knees
I'll put on my weather suit and catch you in the rain
I'll be home before the milk's upon the door

Should I stray to the house on the hill
Let it be known that my intentions were good
I'd be singing in my alley if I could 
 
And if I'm goin' away and it's my turn to go
Should the blood run cold in my veins
Just one favor I'd be askin' of you

It's late September and I really should be back at school

You lured me away from home just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurt

The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age
But that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all of your jokes my love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried any more
You lured me away from home, just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover and
mother what a lover, you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
and in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore
You lured me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand
Oh Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be

When the stars were gone she screamed and yelled hurray

Five thousand tongues are screaming out ""More"" and ""More""

Because life is so brief and time is a thief when you're undecided.
And like a fistful of sand, it can slip right through your hands.

Pause, come on if you doin' it y'all

 [Kid Capri} 
 It's Kid Capri and Jay-Z, It's Kid Capri and Jay-Z 
 Cause I'm Like That yo ! Cause I'm like that yo ! 
 Verse One: Jay-Z 
 As a young and dumb man, gun in the waist 
 Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain 
 And had to numb it with baste 
 Couldn't drink the henny straight, I needed somethin to chase 
 I needed something to chase 
 Nowadays I throw shots back,leavin nothin to waste 
 Life is like a treadmill, niggas runnin in place 
 Gettin nowhere fast, a whole year done past 
 I vowed to never stop winin, 'til the earth stop spinnin 
 Rock hot lenin, cop hot cars and hot women 
 If it's not him then you got it confused, why'all not remembering, 
 My motto is simply I will not lose, abide by the block rules, 
 I buy my glock used, wit bodies on it, let me know anybody want it ? 
 I'm raised, illrational, way misunderstood, 
 If you ain't live like I live then run with the hood 
 I done what i could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still 
 Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature, if hell awaits ya ? 
 Nigga I'm coming with the razors, still flashin ya shit 
 Try to pass me in a six, tight classy on the wrist 
 Every bit of 30 karats, this is not a game 
 This isn't why I came, make these words find a spot on your brain 
 And burn, then I recycle my life 
 I shall return 
 Chorus: Female voice and Jay- Z 
 [Woman] 
 How tight is your flow ? 
 [Jay-Z] 
 Cause I'm like that yo ! 
 [Woman] 
 How right is your dough ? 
 [Jay-Z] 
 Cause I'm like that yo ! 
 [Woman] 
 How white is your blow ? 
 [Jay-Z] 
 Cause I'm like that yo ! 
 [Woman] 
 Only writers you know 
 [Jay-Z] 
 Cause I'm like that 
 Verse 2: Jay-Z 
 I'm a hop, skip, a jump, from rippin the pump 
 Spittin a couple of curse words, and hittin you chump 
 Shit, I get digits in lumps, I'm a motherfucking problem is this what you want 
 ? 
 Overachiever, I love chicks that puff chiva, 
 And reefer paper, I hate the one's that blow up ya beeper 
 Cause I, go in ya deeper, I only bone divas 
 Inpregnate the world when I ""cum"" through your speakers [ha ha] 
 Fuck hot my records got the fever 
 Niggas kick dirt, get ya whole block sweeped up 
 I creep up when the beef heats up, caught him with his feet up 
 And shoes off, bout to snooze off 
 Hatin, cause you can't turn the booze off 
 You dudes is too soft, when I fuck with you all 
 I might bark your ex, and spit at the locks 
 But, other than that I ain't even fucking with cats 
 Just me tied B.I., thug it like that, me,dame and biggs 
 What's fuckin with that ? 
 why'all can never diss Jigga, get nothing for that 
 Other then a couple slugs in ya back,[huh huh] 
 Rappers why'all runnin around, like I won't gun ya down 
 Last nigga that fronted, two spun him around 
 Lord, except this offer here's somethin for your crown 
 I admit no malice, I just met his challenge, In one

Jay Dee,"Yo EL and 'Tin kill'n em, Three kill'n 'em
You thought we broke up but we was just reassemblin'
Ladies and gentlemen you barewitnessin
The villa on some classic shit like vans emblems
It's the guerrilla pimps, we bustin denim in the club
That you can't wear ya denim in
Freakin a rhyme til every line ends with a then and than
You dont wanna rump and stomp in Timberlands
Shout to my nigga Killagan
And all of my peeps that rep more D than 12 Eminems
Who let the dogs out and let Dilla in?
Fuck wit this is ya loss Gilligan
Sounds similar I'm not feelin 'em
Get the balls like Venus in Wimbelon
While I'm in them fly whips five Will and them
On some Kim and them All About the Benjamins
Still here

Still here, never left, just switched the style up
Came through, made moves to get the crowd up
Its hard time ""V"" time nigga ya times up
Get rowed up for the Reunion

L kill'n em, Dilla kill'n 'em
Maybe we could hook up again back wit 'Tin and them
Together again like armed forces on some Fantastic Four or Four Horsemen
Can't do it without ya crew boy
Guess who boy, comin' through with two boy
Nobody but us that rap in a clutch
Passed and switched it up like kids in double dutch
Some couldn't feel our style or feel flow
Never talked our slang, never walked our road
All they know is these niggas is tainted
Don't know about those rovers that candy painted
We've been miss quoted, miss construed, miss understood, and over used
So we take this time to set the record straight
Critics skipped and did it anyway
Now you hear our raps wit Dilla and you all on our team
Till you heard 'Tin was gone was apart of the scheme
See! We still got love where was you at at?
Just cuz a nigga go solo think we turn our backs
Maybe we will reunite on some shit like that
But I gotta set it straight 'fore you twists the facts nigga

Still here, never left, just switched the style up
Came through, made moves to get the crowd up
Its hard time ""V"" time nigga ya times up
Get rowed up for the Reunion

Yo T kill'n em, Three kill'n 'em
You thought we broke up and ya you rite we really did
I wrote a verse that I recited it was hot
But I had to rewrite cause I thought we was united and we not
But though all the love that I got for you
Partna I picked apart ya words and I'm shocked in the interviews
I been accused of not carin'
When the city threw your furniture out
Its not fair when I'm learnin about how stress you fell in a article
Forget a rhyme I'm just as real when I talk to you
And you know that we share Kodak moments
I wish we could go back
But don't act like you wasn't bugin out like a phone tap
Chasin' cars in the street
I saw you throw up hard in the sink
Then after hit the bar for a drink, who asked you to slow down?
Even though niggas told me you was gon' clown
But I tried, and you know I cried when I saw you wild'n at the State Theater
In the door by the side
Throw you in the trunk and found a preacher for you
Cause I thought you had unlawful demons on you
Sinkin fast in the deepest soil
Ya parents finally got you some help
You came out seemin normal and
I heard you on medication
Had a illness you couldn't heal with herbs and meditation
And believe me; Me and T, Three kept it low
Don't take this as a dis this is just to let you know that I love you
But watch the company you keep
Sware niggas don't care, but they love you in the streets

Bitches tongues out like back in the day in the theatres (woo!)
And the heaters is kept where they supposed ta
Smoke ya like the welcome poster
And Dilla got killers that'll gat your boy like Reese's pop
Keep knots like a crumb snatcher boy
When these two niggaz collab', these niggaz collapse
Cause see it gets no hotter, holla at'cha boy

Many often wonder will hip-hop still last
Cause I'm the one they call the Boy Wonder
Fuckin with J-Dilla, rappin niggaz, know how I feel-a

Yo, this is not child's play
Similar to a gat when my mind spray
I spit rhymes like a pro son, rappin shogun
I lunge at you niggaz with a bolo punch
It's the, Boy Wonder at the cruise control
Are you really ready for some super dynamite SOUL
Relax, let me spark the L
And leave smoke on the track as the tires peel
When I rock what's real niggaz appeal to that
13 in the game, makin classic rap
And stay elusive, a lot of y'all fake-ass niggaz
Wish you can do this, passion from the heart makes you true in this
Music, number one sound, overground
Make haste on the freeway like the Greyhound
And avoid these clowns and let real niggaz know

Big Time
Out Of My Dreams
Last night you were here again, third time this week
You always slip in when I'm asleep
I thought those old feelings would be long gone by now
Why in the world do you bother to come back around
You're out of my arms
You're out of my life
Out of every thought
That I let cross my mind
You're out of my hopes
That it might be you every time the telephone rings
But will I ever get you out of my dreams
There we were making wishes on evening stars
Promises sealed with kisses straight from our hearts
But then I woke up to reality again
Even the sweetest dreams come to an end
You're out of my arms
You're out of my life
Out of every thought
That I let cross my mind
You're out of my hopes
That it might be you every time the telephone rings
But will I ever get you out of my dreams

And I do not feel the romance I do not catch the spark
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
And I do not feel the romance I do not catch the spark

I don't know when I noticed life was life at my expense
The words of my heart lined up like prisoners on a fence
The dreams came in like needy children tugging at my sleeve
I said I have no way of feeding you, so leave
But there was a time I asked my father for a dollar
And he gave it a ten dollar raise
And when I needed my mother and I called her
She stayed with me for days
Now someones on the telephone, desperate in his pain
Someones on the bathroom floor doing her cocaine
Someones got his finger on the button in some room
No one can convince me we aren't gluttons for our doom
But I tried to make this place my place
I asked for providence to smile upon me with his sweet face
Yeah but Ill tell you
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
And I do not feel the romance I do not catch the spark
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
(By grace, my sight grows stronger)
And I do not feel the romance I will not be
(And I will not be a pawn for the prince of darkness any longer)

Maybe there's no haven in this world for tender age
My heart beat like the wings of wild birds in a cage
My greatest hope my greatest cause to grieve
And my heart flew from its cage and it bled upon my sleeve
Oh the cries of passion were like wounds that needed healing
I couldn't hear them for the thunder
I was half the naked distance between hell and heavens ceiling
And he almost pulled me under
Now someones on the telephone, desperate in his pain
Someones on the bathroom floor doing her cocaine
Someones got his finger on the button in some room

Nigga die, nigga get high and watch the parade
Back in the early '90s
""Where they at, where they at?
Get the gat, get the gat"" was a popular phrase

I pray this flow is dumb enough ugh
I pray my heart is D.M.C. and rev run enough

I'm a throw some chicken bones and feathers on a hundred bucks

Can't see the forest full of trees
It's okay, I got my jigsaw and my jumber truck

They cried out on the field
So devoted for
Whole team champion they went postal cold
Power overload
Hold up hold my coat
Please remember this day
This changes and so you show anyway
We ready for anything",The Day,2010
Jay Electronica,"""We've only just begun""

Oh, yes, indeed, I like this, I like this
Hey, yo, Hi-Tek, do me a favor, man
Speed it up a little bit

From the intro you know I'm so influential 'cause I'm glowing like a candle
The focus is so essential, dog; what you tryna get into?
I steady the flow, ready to blow like snotty tissue
They snitching like Donnie Brasco, I'm counting like Monte Cristo
The ghetto full of betrayal like Iago and Othello
Your fellow neighbor will slay you; they'll smoke you like cigarillos
Police want that info--they'll grill 'em like Portabellos
I'm murdering instrumentals 'cause I rap with the conscience
Of felons, killers, and monsters, so revealing and honest
We're still feeling the promise; some nights I kill 'em with kindness
Hitting like Muhammad Ali; you more like Tatyana
All this is probably Karma: you dishonored the father
Whether it's God almighty or the almighty dollar
We follow the prophets like Islamics or the Dalai Lama
Your bullet points so hollow they could probably pierce body armor
Look in the scope; my people still a target

Smile on my face, tears of a sad clown
Feeling out of place as I whistle a cab down
If I tip extra, can I huff a cig'?
Blow my smoke out the window, dropping ashes on the bridge
Uh, I'm in New York now like Akeem and Semi was
Tryna get the lobby door open from a semi-buzz
I just wanna go to the slum
And throw my money on the floor like the Notorious B-U-M, uh
Build a home, teach a class, start a revolution
Free the mind, heal the body, talking evolution
This that black Elohim, Anunnaki rap
That Farrakhan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Qaddafi rap
I dedicate this to my niggas in New Orleans
Rocking black and gold stocking caps and fleur-de-lis Shockey hats
I'm in the coatroom, screaming ""who that?"" on the double
Serving gumbo with a shovel, dog, I'm on another level
Me and Kweli come together like two pieces of metal
We magnetizing the ghetto

Yeah, now here's the memo
I'm a rebel without a cause, a bezel without no flaws
And, shorty, you straight; bet you look way better without no drawers
Let's sweat out this alcohol; bet I'm about to ball
And never let up; look how I just crept up without applause
Fed up with all the frauds and left y'all without a job
The center of attention; this is clever; I'm Pau Gasol
Really though I'm LeBron, really don't got my mind
On this new school of rappers I will really go Columbine
And throw up the diamond sign; boy, you know I'm-a shine
Flow is in Ramadan 'cause couple years ago the game had they pajamas on
But now they on my dick; man, I should throw a condom on
'Cause a nigga coming raw like I ain't got one on
And I ain't stopping nor copping no pleas; I just lock and load, squeeze
Dog, I'm on a higher level; I'm on top of nosebleeds
Niggas say they sick, but when they rock, they don't sneeze
Like the nigga on the block waving his glock, but won't squeeze
Please

Hold your applause until the ceremony end
Yours truly, truly blessed, yet again a noble planted
Super magic, abracadabra kid
Mysterious master Jim, blacker pen, arrowhead
With the long-barrel stem and his apparel fresh
Harbor lights shining out the black power grid
With the Black Power grip, and pure power don't power trip
Push the cellar ceiling up and make the tower tip
The Gladwell point and Babylon polish
All about nothing where it's all about the dollar
And mansions on the fault line of a shaky market
The Devil at the dance hall thirsty for a partner
Get off him; there is not a parcel or a portion
Or a measure of a fortune more awesome
Gorgeous, the funky Four Horsemen and one more
With Hi-Tek on the score, once more, of course

You're welcome, thanks
Appreciation for your participation
Special dedication
Celebration, bitches",Just Begun,2010
Jay Electronica,"I deserve to play, it's been a few days, ain't showed it all
I go outside and breathe, roll down my sleeves and have a ball
Still got these bills to pay and a family, I'm workin' hard
But I got a life too, so I throw on my shoes and I live it y'all

I'm fresher than a peppermint and cold as a cough
When I pull up in that foreign and I break boys off
Super ballin' is a product of a hard knock life
No more Ramen noodle spread, no more struggle and strife
From a Buick to a Beamer, ambitions of a dreamer
Motivated by Mob Figgaz and Andre Nickatina
I'm gettin' paper while you're in the shade drinkin Zima
I'm a schemer, you just waitin' on your check from FEMA
Been evadin' the subpoena to appear in court
Different hustle every season like I'm playin' a sport
""Life is too short, wouldn't you agree?""
See, the best time I ever had in my life was free
My best friend wasn't real, he came with a fee
Reduced time for your sentence come with a plea
Livin' in the free world and I'm blessed
Paper chasin' is my quest, I grind with no rest

I deserve to play, it's been a few days, ain't showed it all
I go outside and breathe, roll down my sleeves and have a ball
Still got these bills to pay and a family, I'm workin' hard
But I got a life too, so I throw on my shoes and I live it y'all

I'm not a actor, a role model with soul or clapper
I work hard, a good gangsta nigga, blow a stack up
Time still movin' and shit, stay on the grind, it's just excuses
Girls lookin' at you, you useless (word?)
When everything is wrong, it look like it'll fall
I'm on the job, feet first with direction and all
I like coca and then gotta come home and stroke her
Take time, clean my rims and go lock' her
Just wanna lay up, damn
I need two minutes to rest, go 'head and take the Lex' out, scram
Then it's beef in the jump off, 'cause I needed one off
It's like you drew your gun on me in a gun off
Shit won't change, so move with it (move with it)
This is my life, I'm only livin' it, so don't go and ruin it
Words from a legend, keep your dome up in the sky
Listen to Paul Wall and Chef Fly (get high)

I deserve to play, it's been a few days, ain't showed it all
I go outside and breathe, roll down my sleeves and have a ball

Dear Mr. President, have you seen FEMA?
Have you seen the lower 9th Ward, post Katrina?
Niggas scufflin' tryin' to find something tangible
The MP's is treatin' all the youth like animals
Then wonder why the cops gettin rocked like Mosley
Why niggas on the TV in the spot like cozy
Now Houston got a problem, Atlanta got a problem
Dallas, Alabama and Miami got a problem
Niggas wildin' out, livin' free, yellin' sovereign
.38 revolvin', crack rock ballin'
Tats on they face that say Uptown New Orleans
Blastin' on sight, fuck fightin', fuck arguin'
Meanwhile boat loads of cash go to Israel
Soldiers in Iraq pray to God for a miracle
Sam Cooke said that change was comin'
If not, you can bet your ass, danger's comin'

I deserve to play, it's been a few days, ain't showed it all
Go outside and breathe, roll down my sleeves and have a ball

But I got a life too, so I throw on my shoes and I live it y'all",Live It,2010
Jay Electronica,"When I was sleepin' on the train
Sleepin' on Meserole Ave out in the rain
Without even a single slice of pizza to my name
Too proud to beg for change, mastering the pain
When New York niggas were calling southern rappers lame
But then jacking our slang
I used to get dizzy spells, and hear a little ring
The voice of a angel telling me my name
Telling me that one day I'mma be a great mane
Transforming with the Megatron Don spittin out flames
Eatin' wack rappers alive, shittin' out chains

I ain't believe it then, nigga I was homeless
Fightin', shootin dice, smokin weed on the corners
Tryna find the meaning of life in a corona
Till the 5 percenters rolled up on a nigga and informed him
You either build or destroy, where you come from?
The Magnolia projects in the 3rd ward slum
Its quite amazing that you rhyme how you do
And how you shine like you grew up in a shrine in Peru
Question 14, Muslim Lesson 2, dip diver, civilize a 85er
I make the devil hit his knees and say the ""Our Father""
Abracadabra!
You rockin with the true and living
Shot out to Lights Out, Joseph I, Chewy Bivens
Shout out to Baltimore, Baton Rouge, my crew in Richmond
While y'all debated who the truth was like Jews and Christians
I was on Cecil B, Broad Street, Master, North Philly, South Philly, 23rd
Tasker, 6 mile, 7 mile, Hartwell, Gratiot
Where niggas really would pack a U-haul truck up
Put the high beams on
Drive up on the curb at a barbecue and hop out the back like what's up
Kill a nigga, rob a nigga, take a nigga, bust up
That's why when you talk the tough talk I never feel ya
You sound real good and you play the part well
But the energy you givin off is so unfamiliar
I don't feel ya

Nas hit me up on the phone, said what you waitin on?
Tip hit me up with a tweet, said what you waitin on?
Diddy send a text every hour on the dot sayin
When you gon drop that verse nigga you taking long
So now I'm back spittin that he could pass a polygraph
That Reverend Run rockin Adidas out on Hollis Ave
That FOI, Marcus Garvey, Niki Tesla
I shock you like an eel, electric feel, Jay Electra

Fuck that
Call me Jay ElecHannukah
Jay ElecYarmulke
Jay ElectRamadaan
Muhammad Asalaamica RasoulAllah
Subhanahu wa ta'ala through your monitor
My uzi still weighs a ton, check the barometer
I'm hotter than the muthafuckin' sun, check the thermometer
I'm bringing ancient mathematics back to modern man
My momma told me never throw a stone and hide your hand
I got a lot of family, you got a lot of fans
That's why the people got my back like the Verizon man
I play the back and fade to black and then devise a plan
Out in London, smoking, vibin' while I ride the tram
Givin' out that raw food to lions disguised as lambs
And, by the time they get they seats hot
And deploy all they henchmen to come at me from the treetops
I'm chillin out at Tweetstock
Building by the millions
My light is brilliant",Exhibit C,2011
Jay Electronica,"Niggas be askin' me like, ""Man you took all that time off
I understand you had to get your mind right or whatever
you was doin' but I'm just curious to know
how you, how you gonna approach the next shit?""
Say it's the same way I always do, not givin' a fuck

Million dollar maker, not a faker, try to call me over the hill
It's probably cause you saw me chillin' beside a pile of paper
Life's a Picasso painting, psyche, my life's more like an obstacle, ain't it?
Like it's somethin' in front of the drop, and I gotta ride around it
On my way to make me another child support payment
From humble beginnings, though we live lavishly now
And what we couldn't afford to get, we would have it somehow
Stayin' at grandma's, puddled in front of the open oven
Rubbin' our hands together like Baby with cameras around
Manic depressed, drawn to my tool
Genetically predisposed to be a mechanic or less
I handle my failures way better than I ever handled success
And I let you boys be the loudest, holdin' my 44
From '94, on my retro kick before I let you let go clips
I'll let Michael Jordan be my stylist
I'll rock one of them baggy ass Tracy McGrady suits
I've been poppin' since I was 5, that was in '82
Believe that, a nigga been knockin' more lady's boots
Than Kanye critiquin' at Steve Madden
I'm just a LOX fan with childish thinkin'
The last time I got pulled over for drunk drivin'
I took the breathalyzer out the cop's hand and tried to drink it
That's what I do for my community
Your boo told me what she wanna do to me
Before she dropped on two knees and then blew me like an opportunity

(To me, it's what I see
To you, it's what you do)
Phryme!
Ha ha ha-ha, if I could make niggas as real as me
Ha ha ha-ha, I'd ask, ""how come niggas ain't real as me?""

Your favorite rapper's up at LIV
While I'm on controlled substances, search around my crib for a fuck to give
But I couldn't find it
My notebook should be made of a wooden binder
Cause that's what my albums be sellin'
But I don't give a fuck about nothin' but good vagina
Long as these niggas call me GOAT
If I don't get through to you the call failed
Cause I was probably on that Wolf of Wall Street boat, I'm a hard sell
Maybe too lyrical for 'em
The Lord gave me a choice to either be king or give all Hell
I chose the latter like a fireman climbin' up to a charred rail
In front of Miley, starin' a giant wreckin' ball
Miss me with your mollies and your Tyrese wisdom
I don't connect with y'all and these antics
Today you give your life to the game
Tomorrow you be posin' in pictures, lookin' like Steve Francis
You ain't turnin' up, you're bein' backhanded like Pete Sampras
About that, I missed my uncle's funeral to go to South by Southwest
You ain't gotta appreciate it, but you better respect the fact
That I'm a real rapper and nothin' whack done came out my mouth yet

Me and Pharaoh is like Dorothy and Toto on the brick road
Crossin' at the crissroads
The valleys and the alleys where the gods switch to bitch mode
I came through, the Harley pipe was loud like a lion
The title on the marquee said ""Child out of Zion""
Contemplatin' on another plane, hoverin' down lover's lane
Won a great debate against the state about the mother plane
He called me by that other name, I called him by his other name
The lightnin' struck the internet like a screen door in a hurricane
Jay Electricity, baptized by Felicity
Where he been the past three years? It's just a mystery
If it ain't come from one of my peers, it ain't a diss to me
I'm a thousand leagues under the sea, niggas can't get to me
The F in my middle name with the period stands for ""Victory""
I came from the bottoms of Hell with Jezebels
Sniffin' blow with her friends in the dens of iniquity
When I was young, I was confused, I thought God was a mystery
But everything I knew since the time I began to grew
Was taught to me by the wickedest men, who twist the histories
Who pulled out the cuffs of deception and and hitched their wrist to we
Now all praises due to Allah, we seein' crystally
The Pyramids are there to bear witness to the gods
So when the angels heard me spit, they bit their lip, this shit is hard
Utterly unstoppable, in high school I was voted most popular
By the unpopular, phantom of the chakras

Good God, the gift of freedom
Hosena Santa invoked and woke up slaves from south Hampton to Chatham Manor
My dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm James Early
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed
Here, for I will speak noble things as they trusted me
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt, Exalt, glorify
Descend upon the earth with swords and fortify the borders where your shoulders lies
I used to hide from God
Ducked down in the slums like ""shhh""

I was lost in the jungle like Simba after the death of Mufasa
No hog, no meerkat, hakuna matata by day
But I spent my night time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages but never got no hear back
Or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark, gently, gently, rowed my boat down Noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach my petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud couldn't even let my light shine
But she was always there when I needed to phone a friend or use a life line
From a lofty height to wage war
On the poltergeist with the exalt of Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal of tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Cali will swallow a valley for every African village burned

O' son of man, O' son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations with the foot on water and the foot on land
Who was the angel that rode a Harley from the project to the house of Parliament
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber and put the true name of the Lord in it

Cuff lights these beats with a ball of fire
They poisoned the scripture and gave us the pictures of false messiahs

Euphoria to torture
I left a note that had a rhyme, it go

Love is like a roller coaster
Love is at a standstill
Body after body after body
It's a landfill and I just caught a body

I dreamed a dream one day

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed

Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Jay Epstein,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams

Jay Epstein,"In the white room with black curtains near the station.
Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings.
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes.
Dawn light smiles on you leaving, my contentment.

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines;
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.

You said no strings could secure you at the station.
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.
I walked into such a sad time at the station.
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning.

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back;
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves.

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd.
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten.
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes.
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings.

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves.",White Room,2009
Jay Farrar,"Ride the blue wind high and free
She'll lead you down through misery
Leave you low, come time to go
Alone and low, as low can be

Well, if I had a nickel, I'd find a game
If I won a dollar, I'd make it rain
If it rained an ocean, I'd drink it dry
And lay me down dissatisfied

It's legs to walk and thoghts to fly 
Eyes to laugh and lips to cry
A restless tongue to classify
All born to grow and grown to die

So tell me baby, I said so loing
Tell my mother, I did no wrong
Tell my brother to watch his own 
And tell my friend to mourn me none

I'm chained upon the face of time
Feelin' full of foolish rhyme
There ain't not dark till something shines
I'm bound to leave the dark behind

Well, ride the blue wind, high and free
She'll lead you down through misery
Leave you low, come time to go 
Alone and low, as love as can be
Alone and low, as love as can be",Rex's Blues,1995
Jay Farrar,"If I ran so far that my life can't follow me
Would it keep the world from up and swallowing me
There's so much to weigh me down that I can hardly breathe
And I don't want to think about it
But I don't want this pain to last and I'm fading fast

If I didn't look back and I changed my name
Would I find my new life exactly the same
I'm looking at an empty future that I already blame
And I don't want to think about it
But I don't want this pain to last and I'm fading fast

I've put it all behind me just to have it one day find me
And now I'm just this far from gone

And so I'm leaving here on every cent that I could borrow
Lord only knows just where I'll be tomorrow
And I don't want to think about it

With a broken wing
No beasts of prey
Are hungry for now
Hair raising prospects
In head tone harmony

When the way is finally found
In the stacks and piles
Of dead promises
That we keep around

From the grotto haze
The days will elevate
From near ruination
To the détente
From the bedlam block
To the real time rodeo

In the stacks and piles
Of dead promises
That we keep around

In the stacks and piles
Of dead promises

The spirit of the one constant thread
Policing yourself, a lifelong pursuit
Hanging on to the ring of the bell

The world spins around 
And the rules we'd rather forget
It's not what we're here for
So dear to die for
Believe it's worth saving yet

Never found any other way
Not to preach or teach
Not good at either one

Bared the glare of cold war trash, put it on the table, 
Stained the course leaking, work-a-day degradation.

My decisions
Put me in the wrong positions

Not only a name
A definition
My game remains no matter the pain
I stay a charmer

I navigate like the Dalli Lama
I ain't a saint
But I've got joi de vie

Or even let regret
Provoke the energy it takes
For me to get upset

So I can't forget
what goes around
Comes around
And it ain't got me yet

And tame the treat of my rage
I've got allot to learn
And I've got money to spend
To pretend is reaping more
Than sewing ever could mend

Trade my torches for a dime
Black cloud's lifted for the light
The pressure's fading away now
A thousands cigarettes
Won't change the way we feel
The pressure's fading now
Can you bare the though of knowing truth?
Knowing truth?

I was rapping in the rain
Hoping that my luck would change
And if there's any truth
To all those all sayings
'Cause if I kill a spider
Would my house catch on fire?
If I walk under a ladder
Would it matter?
I tend to laugh
When a black cats cross my path
Break mirrors in half
Just to test the aftermath
Now here comes the rain
I protect my pain
Trying to make sense
Of these crazy things
I'm a diamond in the rough
Could I suffer enough?
I'm getting high for a living
Not giving a fuck
These hard times got me stuck
Stuck in a jam
Disastrous
Took time to master this
And the past
Is just a map to capture this
In the darkness
I'm force to adapt to this
I would change the past
If I could have one wish

And I'll always be true
Forever with you
It just isn't long enough
What would I do
Without You
(I love only you)
And nobody else
(With feelings so new)
Like I've never felt
(Come hold my hand)
Aw, get all closer to me
(Cause you understand)
How true love should be

But that's just a start
What I'm trying to say
I'd give you my heart
But it's yours anyway

[Chorus]

What would I do without you
To me you're the meaning of
The meaning of love
And I'll always be true
Forever with you, yeah
It just isn't long enough
What would I do
Without.....

Your kisses and your tender touch
I love you I love you I love you so much
Baby there's something I want you to know
I'm gonna die if you ever go

[Chorus]

What would I do without you
To me you're the meaning of
The meaning of love
And I'll always be true
Forever with you
It just isn't long enough
What would I do
Without You
What would I do without you
To me you're the meaning of
The meaning of love
And I'll always be true
Forever with you
Forever's not long enough
What would I do
Without You
What would I do (yeah",Sugar Berry Fairy,2003
