Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to japan quake losers and survivors
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to sound better but the killer was a Coward
Face just showers, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news all day went sour
Lil' mama got me feeling like a limit here
Put you in the box just the presidents cigarettes
Give em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers just the young and restless
Get mad 'cause the quarter million on my necklace

You and I or jealously was not oppressive

Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Rihanna kiss you on ya neck just kill critics

Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Mr Mike Caren, tell his Billie Jeans
I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries

'Cause I donâ€™t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think Iâ€™d have a heart attack 
I think Iâ€™d have a heart attack 

Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And everytime I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
Itâ€™s just not fair
Painâ€™s more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts

Iâ€™m flying too close to the sun

Surfboard and high tide
I could just go up

So that birthday cake could warm up

When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance

Kieran Kane,"His daddy said when he was a baby
He was impossible to hold
He'd fuss and fight and then he'd giggle all night
Terrify the whole household

But he'd listen to his bedtime stories
He believed what he was told
About gypsy camps, saddle tramps
And rainbow gold

He had about a million questions
Liked to drove everybody wild
He'd ask them stuff that was just too tough
They all told him, ""hush up child""

So it came as no surprise
When he left his home so young
Looking for some kind of paradise
I don't know what else he could have done

He was a scholar
Though he never really went to school
He stood amazed at the world's ways
And he followed the golden rule

He knew a little bit about everything
He could pretty much guess the rest
And he always seemed to know what you mean
If you took him in your confidence

Now most people run around in circles
But he ran a real straight line
The only thing wrong was that before too long
He left everyone who loved him behind

So it came as no surprise
When he left his home so young
Looking for some kind of paradise
Looking for something that he hadn't already done

Well he got to be hard to keep track of
Everybody was a little confused
And then one time the old grapevine
Whispered the strangest news

Now maybe he didn't mean to do it
I understand it if you've got your doubts
But I got a good idea that the coast was clear
And he figured he'd just bust on out

Now friends I'm not saying that it was a good thing
I'm not saying that it makes much sense
I just know that he was the kind to cross every line
Jump every single last fence

So it comes as no surprise
That he left his home so young
Still looking for some kind of paradise
The fool thought he had to go all the way to kingdom come

The only thing that I really wonder about now
Keeps running across my mind
If he ever caught his breath between his birth and death

If he ever caught his breath between birth and death
I swear I don't know where he ever found the time

And I lie when I can
But I die a little slower
On the train to Birmingham
I got holes in both my shoes
Got a guitar full of blues
And a one way ticket for my remedy
It's the same ol' lonesome song
I've been singing all night long
Hey, porter, are we out of Tennessee
Well I cry when I have to
And I lie when I can
But I die a little slower
On the train to Birmingham

Well every year I take this train
To Alabama in the rain
When I get that lonesome feelin' in my bones
I never get to Birmingham
But gettin' there ain't the plan
I just like the feel of going home
Well I cry when I have to
And I lie when I can
But I die a little slower

Kieran Kane,"For awhile while we were on the run
We had too misery, too much fun
Back then I guess either one would do
For awhile while I was loving you
The stars were brighter and the river ran deeper
The wind was warmer and the whiskey sweeter
Me, I was learning how
Much a believer can do
For awhile while I was loving you
I loved you tender, I loved you wild
Like a fatherless devil, like a motherless child
Lord when you left me, it felt like you cut me in two
For awhile while I was loving you
When I think of it now it's all like a dream
I lived in a world that was not what it seemed
I was believing that all of my dreams had come true For awhile while I was
loving you

No I don't need no taxi back to town.
I think I'll just stay right here in this deep old light,
I was supposed to meet someone here tonight,
I'm sittin' here thinking,
Waiting on a dark-eyed gal.

Well, I don't mind the rain; I never even noticed
And I don't feel the cold, it wouldn't matter anyhow,
As a matter of fact I could stay until the break of day,
I don't see as I'm in anybody's way;
I'm just sittin' here thinkin',
Waiting on a dark eyed gal.

She said she'd meet me at the station,
I don't believe she'll keep me waiting very long
Very long.

She never told me if she was coming with me
Or if she only meant to say her last farewell
Never was one to let me know her mind
So I'll stay right here, keep doing my time
Just sitting here thinkin',

And turn 'em into fine machines

Or I was living too good to listen to the preacher

At one time, I was truly a circumstantial kind of praiser
Only when things were going good, I'd lift my voice in worship
Forgetting when all of the chips were down, who faithfully
Stayed around and helped me out, Lord, I don't know how?

At times I lost sight of my faith
At times I tried but I found it hard to wait on You
Many times I have taken things in my own hands
And messed up bad, so here I am singing

This is me, a person saved by grace
Humbly, confessing, with You I'm something
But without You I'm nothing, Lord

This is me, so plain and ordinary
This is me, minus everything fancy
Placed simply here to give You praises
And give honor to Your name

Through trials, You mold me I'm forever a work of art in progress
Though I don't always seem to see it, yes, it does manifest
It's just so evidently no one can deny that You're the One
Working through me, so I can be what You called me

With thoughts of faith, I read Your word and boldly claim my blessings
And with my whole heart I will worship You for simply being
Above all things, the morning star that brings light and hope for me

Kiesza,"Yo, yo, yo, yo
Come fuck with a pro
Bad thing, bad thing
What you saying mama

Tougher than a leather goose
I wanna say your last name
You ain't playin' by the rules
But you gonâ€™ change the whole game
I donâ€™t wanna suit and shade that cool
While until the love pain
Danger when you make me ooh
But I think thatâ€™s a good thing

Maybe thatâ€™s a bad thing, bad thing
Maybe thatâ€™s a bad thing, bad thing
Iâ€™mma fiend for that thing, that thing (ooh, ooh)

Maybe thatâ€™s a bad thing, bad thing
Maybe thatâ€™s a bad thing, bad thing
Iâ€™mma fiend for that thing, that thing (ooh, ooh)

I donâ€™t want to ever choose
Keep it jumpin' like a trampoline
No matter what you put me through
You always make it worth it
We go together me and you
Grey box and a rope chain
Enough to make me say I do
And I think thatâ€™s a good thing

Maybe thatâ€™s a bad thing, bad thing
Maybe thatâ€™s a bad thing, bad thing
Iâ€™mma fiend for that thing, that thing (ooh, ooh)

Maybe thatâ€™s a bad thing, bad thing
Maybe thatâ€™s a bad thing, bad thing
Iâ€™mma fiend for that thing, that thing (ooh, ooh)

But in conclusion, it's only time we losing
We get deluded by these illusions, constant confusions
And every movin', any time that we doin'
What could be a great duet
Gets neglected, feel my solar plexus tryna get you back babe
Tell me where it's at, where it's at, at, at
Gotta pack of that yack, yack, yack
That'll probably snap that back
Hit the cat till it's cataracts
But you like the sound of that
Now bring it back
We the perfect match to start a culture, might start it happen
Don't get too attached, 'cause I adapt to change quick see
My way of livin' fast, be on my switchin' lanes shit
You're sick of all that anguish, 'cause you know how that game get
If you ain't speaking that dollar bill
Then you ain't speaking that language
I'm, dancin' with this little devil
I, condescend when usually I'm on a higher level, sip a little Red Bull
Now we growing wings, she's the girl of my dreams
I could, give her my last name but that's a bad thing (yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Maybe thatâ€™s a bad thing, bad thing (Maybe thatâ€™s a bad thing)
Maybe thatâ€™s a bad thing, bad thing

Kiesza,"Mr. Worldwide, I just want to welcome everybody to my life
It's heaven on earth, but it's one hell of a ride
Kiesza, let's show everybody why love is a battlefield
Tell them how you feel

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demand
Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield

Closed the Grammys and got all the credits, literally
But I'm a hustler boy, you can't rid of me
I'm not religious but my passport looks like a bible
Presidential debates unreliable
Politicians want to politick and politrick
That's why I call this shit politricks
I'm a young man, old soul
I can't listen to this new school shit to me it's just so-so
I did my own thing, created my own lane
I may not like the players, but I love the game
I love the hustle and that's real
And that's why love is a battlefield

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demand
Love is a battlefield
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield

Born in Miami, Cuban boy in the '80s
Took over the game and they thought we were crazy
You name it we did, we bought it, we sipped it, we run it
Let all these public traded companies know that we're coming
David vs. Goliath, live in the flesh, Armando Perez, boy am I blessed
I learned from the worst, but listened to the best
Figure out that riddle and figure out success
I did my own thing, created my own lane
I may not like the players, but I love the game
I love the hustle and that's real
And that's why love is a battlefield

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demand
Love is a battlefield
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield",We Are Strong,2017

You've been having a lot of problems lately'

And like, maybe you should talk about it, you'll feel a lot better'

Just leave me alone I'll figure it out
You know I'll just work it out myself'

Kiki & Herb,"Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.

Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.

Kiki Dee,"Well you'll know what it is when you've found it
It hits you right between the eyes
And you won't find another way around it
''cause the dark's standing in the light
Well it shortens the range of your vision
So you can't even see your hands
And it stands on one leg and just listens -
Don't talk ''cause it understands.
You need help, I'm coming
Over the hill, to set you free
You need help, hold on now
Gonna save you if you wait for me.
Well you won't hear a shout or a whisper
When it moves it'll make no sound
But you'll know what it is when it hits you
By the time that you reach the ground
You need help, I'm coming
Over the hill, to set you free
You need help, hold on now
Gonna save you if you wait for me.

When it's past four o'cIock in the morning
And the moon begins to wane
Try to run if you get any warning
Watch out here it comes again.
Do you hear?
It's getting near
It's coming close
Don't look now
It's standing by your shoulder
You need help - here I come
Hold one 'cause here I come.

Kiki Dee,"When a dear old friend came by today
We sure had a lot to say
Of the time we had so long ago
When answers to a dream were all we needed

To glide along our time
We remember, when you and I were fine
In the night hours
There's a look of sadness in your eyes

As you look at me in recollection
I don't know what you're thinking of
Then you smile
Say ""You're looking good, sweet love""

And we glide along our time
We remember, when you and I were standing
We were standing
In the fading shadows

Play that song
The one that made me cry
Sing along your harmonies
Before you say goodbye

There's a look of sadness in my eyes
As I see you now in my reflection
And the time so long ago is clearer now
So we take it kinda slow

And we glide along our time
And something still remains
When you shared your pain with someone
So long ago

So long ago

Some of them will touch you at the heart
Some of them will leave you cold leave you cold

Where's that child of mine tonight
When her soul gets too heavy
she needs to laugh out loud again
Now it's time to let her go
(chorus)
Listen to the story of a mother and daughter
(Suno suno ma aur beti ki kahani)
But they both feel the silence under the night sky
The messenger has taken flight
Delivering her from a weary heart
delivering a world of change a world of change
She's scared as a rabbit starring into a head light
Hell bent on her own way
Her mind's a million miles away
Mama don't be afraid it's a road I have to follow

Deep inside I feel my soul aflame 
Can my life ever be the same?

I'd do anything if I could hold him

Turned the key into another world 
Made a woman of a simple girl

Soon my fantasies will turn to dust 
But I would give him anything he asked 
If my first love could be my last

So you can't even see your hands
And it stands on one leg and just listens -

You need help, hold on now

Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping
Out on the street the traffic starts jumping
With folks like me on the job from nine to five

Nine to five, what a way to make a living
Barely getting by; it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind, and they never give you credi
It's enough to drive you crazy, if you let it

They let you dream just to watch them shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn, and it's all gonna roll your way

Nine to five, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead, but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me

Con sus huellas, ay

Y recordÃ© todo lo triste y lo malo
Que pasÃ© contigo
Que fue por ella todo lo que he sufrido
Con su olvido hoy",Hoy Te VI Pasar,2006

Nos enamoramos 
Why al inicio nada resulto fasil
Tubimos todo el mundo en contra

why sigue siendo asi 
Pero luchamos why aqui juntos estamos
Amandonos?

why nada pudo ocn este amor( este amor)
No pudieron separarnos
Why mientras mas difisil mas yo siento que yo te amo
Asi es el amor!!!

Coro.

Te jure que nadie nos separaria
Junto hasta el final
Inseparables como arena why el mar
Esto no va a terminar ( esto no va a terminar)
Por que nos vamos a amar

Te jure que nadie nos separaria

Inseparables como arena why el mar
Esto no va a terminar 
Por que nos vamos a amar( por que nos vamos amar)





Rap.

Mi Corazon contigo se impacto
Testigo a sido el tiempo que nada nos separo
Se que lo que dentro siento si es amor
Por eso cuando te beso es como un choke de passion
Asi que las palabras estan de mas
Tu why yo hasta la muerte siempre vamos a estar
No tendra final lo nuestro es real
Imposible que se acabe lo que DIOS quizo crear
Yo soy el rey tu eres mi baby
Si yo fuera el presidente tu fueras my first lady
Eres para mi la mas sexy mami
Asi que en esto soy yo tambien tu papi
Por ti luchara hasta con un ejercito de mara
Con tal de amanecer contigo en cada madrugada
Ya nada nos separa somos uno no dos
Un sentimiento sin barrera asi es el amor.

Rap.

Inseparables somos tu why yo
Por mas que trataron nuestro amor cresio
Subio como la espuma libre sin pena why sin duda
Tu figura me enloquese como tu no existe una
Asi que todo eso que fue causa de tropiezo
A sido solo un ejemplo de que nuestro amore s ciego
Qeu nada ni nadie puede con los dos
Que todo lo pasado se fue al safacon
Enamorados atados juntos why fucionados
Como traje confecionado a la medida asi estamos
Por ti yo me derrito como vela ma 
Why mas cuando tan dulcet you me dices pa
Dejemos tras sin sabores ya 
Vamos mas alla luchemos como iack
Ya nada nos detiene somos uno no dos
Un sentimiento sin barrera asi es el amor.

This road that you shall travel, will seem like nowhere.
That nowhere, will turn into somewhere
Keep your head up Bubba, don't let nobody get you down,
Cause that road you travel will turn around

I've accepted every challenge, and risen to all occasions
A country boy that's got his shit like Randy Moss and Jason
Perhaps some of these numerals don't fit in ya'lls equation
If your opinions coincide with that you oughta save Ã¢??em
Lookin' for the greatest Southern rapper, fuck it period
Negative spirits they only keeping down a myriad 
Of Satan's substances, and my systems' still my wisdom
It never once compromised that between God and I
Never once forgotten my manners
Cause my ma'ama played in public housin' in Alabama
But she had a diff'rent plan for me, russ and ginger
Thank the lord for Jimmy Mathis, pops he must remember us
Are you really down when those other clowns disappear
Taught me how to set the scope, shoot and leave with the deer
Man made me drink the blood, and showed me life was precious
The muddy road from nowhere to somewhere is my direction

Can you relate five kids, six fish sticks on the plate
All writin' to Santa Claus, I guess he got the list too late
Or to catch the fish you bait the hook with lil' Dylan's poo-poo
On Mr. Allen's property, he catch you, he will shoot you
Let these cats amuse you with comical depictions
But where I'm from being broke is no honorable affliction
Love some Jimmy Carter, but we never even voted
But slum is still slum, so you best believe we told it
Every five armed from AK's to 30-30's
And from live watch to live stock they pays the early birdy
Thus we worked the land like you worked the block with yayo
But I choose keys over cattle cause the profits way more
But I might get locked away though peddling the sno cones
So we keep it simplified with papers of that homegrown
It's the finest shine that you can find on this side of Memphis
From east nowhere to west somewhere still the grind is endless

[Chorus]

It all comes down to this, one last chance to advance
Beyond the second round of the big dance, all my plans
Of being viewed as something special, more than just the other one
We'll vanish from the papers and the plague the South has suffered from
The world's weight plus a ton, restin' on my shoulders
But what's attractive, to ease my nerve, is blessed to the beholder
Cause Eminem's incredible, but did I really need to say this
For ya'll to leave my soul at rest and add me to your playlist
But this time I may just, leap and clear that hurdle man
Cause there's gonna be a million more, who knows if they'll be worth a damn
Bubba K, I surely am, with that silky kinda sound
Carson Daily host it out, I'll be early for this time around
Cause I've come to far for my own mistakes to quell me
Cause looking back at self improvement proves an aching ailment 
Cause nothing they can tell me will get me somewhere in a hurry
If I'm nowhere, then that nowhere will leave me no more need to worry",Nowhere,2003

Blame it on trap music and the politicians

Do you still think of me, is it still in the air? Do you still think of me, do you even care? (2nd verse) It happened without warning, so calm before the storm. Ending day or breaking dawn, again my feelings torn. Even though it hurts me, I still remember the days. How good you made me feel, I lost count of the ways.

",Last Song,2001
Kill Your Idols,"

At age 41, the king was dead
It wasn't the beginning or the end
Shouting for his freedom
He was silenced again
Maybe for the last time
The government
Just couldn't stand
To see their morals questioned
Another example of non freedom of speech
""he needs to be silenced""
In 1962 he plead guilty
To the lies of the state
After years of urging rebellion
He moved out west
A peaceful existence?
I don't think so
Retreated, lost and beaten
He sunk into depression
Losing battles to bottles
No money for bills
And no will to live
New years 1965 is when he collapsed
And the bottle toook his life
At age 43 he died alone and broke
With nothing but his family
A physical existence can be erased
But true legends never die
And where were his friends
When the end took him away?
No where to be found he gave it
A name and direction ""rock and roll""
End: I hope its true that when we die
We can look back on what we have done
Because I think Alan Freed would be glad to know
That the rebellion still carries on
Whenever someone raises their middle finger
And goes against the norm
I hope he knows that he didn't die in vain
Its not goodbye, just goodnight

'cause I be Rollin, Rollin, Rollin on them twenty-twos
Ain't got no money or love for you funny fools
'cause I be Rollin, Rollin, Rollin on them twenty-twos
Sippin brews, packin tools for you funny fools

[Monk]
I'm from the land of chaos where niggaz get shot for trippin
I caught a fool slippin on some D's, now I'm steady dippin
Cruisin, movin up the block 'cause I'm the shit
Stick dick to hoodrats, make gangsta hits
I baptize my sticks, ice skate on seventeens
On the phone with five-oh, don't you love them D's?
While they spin, you freeze in ya souped up paint clean
Fifties, amps, six by nines and thangs
Comin down the block, let my sub straight bang
Like, ""Fuck the po-po's, I'm not turnin it down""
I love to floss as I toss up a fifth of that Crown
Bank corner after corners, watch all the ho's smile

Slingin newspapers on the Verrazano Narrow
Gettin off the fifth train on Carol to get wet
Summertime sweat got me rockin short sets
From the loaf tops, no socks, Hawaiian suits
Tied nicely with the wooden spoon for the scoop
Young girls playin double Dutch and hoola-hoops
Cap'n Crunch and Fruit Loops, camels and goose boots
It was the FUBU, the stripped Lee's, the Hoopty's
Five dollar bag of weed's a real bag of weed
A ki was at twenty g's, hurled one at dope fiends
O.D., niggaz throwin bricks at my click
Now Giulianni got the state N.Y. locked like cuff
Black Bad Boys gettin rich like Puff
The Excursion truck need two spots on the parkin lot
A stash box for the top, the lock

Brook-nam, grace and charm, remain calm with chron's of Lebanon
Black man author, green Leprechaun from Lexington
P. Sunn, I crack ya face with the gun
Smack the taste outta ya dunn, ya fam's on the run
Now why'all respect Sunn, shine all type direction
Hype discretion with the right connection, recitin lessons
But my wea-pon reign automatic projection
Blow out ya reception, hose through ya reflection
Old gold complexion, Sunn I'll swoll to perfection

Killa Kam,"Yo
My crew is in the house
Terra, Herb McGruff, Buddah Bless
Big Twan, Killa Cam, Trooper J, and Mike Boogie
And I'mma set it like this

Aiyo, folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast, when my Smith-Wes' blast
So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don't get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smirk, cause these knuckles hurt
I'm from the alley, not the valley
I'm hotter than Cali, wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally, I rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don't hang with jive pals
Adios, ghost, I'm 5 thous'

Well, I'm flav, and I was down with the crime wave
Now it's time saved, yo, cause now I'm a rhyme slave
In '87 I sold cracks, collected some dough stacks
Hold gats, a joker got his soul taxed
Innovated, rappers you know who made it
Tell the Terra to rotate it, his raps are gold-plated
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother, I leave your rhyme trash gutter
I'm more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that Lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow-up
Sour luck, niggas got and popped and swallow nuts

For those that don't know, yo, I'm Herb McGruff
I'm on some murder stuff
And when I talk every verb is rough
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise, break bones
Then wind up bloody in a bodybag
MC's are live, but I'm mad liver
Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice and peas
(Herb, can you fight?) Yo, I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from hell
I'm the fuck up outta here

Aiyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews cause I'm bad news
In a mad mood I'm serving brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
Cause I'm no maricon, for poems I slide the hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Aiyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice
And cold take a fag's life
My swellin melon got niggas jealin
Aiyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin niggas lives like a felon

Yo, I bust chumps like a Glock 10, when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill the show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail
Been no frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail
Yeah, ain't I nasty, too nasty to trash me
Bash me, aiyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that sawed-off
And when I let slugs out, you will get rugged out
For dissin, you come up missing like a cub scout

Rappers be funny like Flex, cause they section's 80 slaughter, son
Talk about nines and tecs, and never shot a watergun
But Killa Kam, I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease cause once I release
My crew from the east, we leavin at least
20 police deceased, it's the beast on attack
So make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats and black macs
On Lenox Ave. ain't no light looks, you fight crooks
Left and right hooks, if you front, get your life took

I'm havin nail-sharp pains in my brain like a hellraiser
I'm blazin trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin but lead
Boom-bye-bye, dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up, and keep my head straight

I should never rhyme cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones and sendin' niggas hoppin' home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're come to see me, nigga, bring a cast and crutches
And niggas, I dont' need a gun for you, none of you
Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their muthafuckin' ass to ash
No need to question am I nice, cause it's a fact, friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a Mac-10
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough
Peace to Big L, ayo, 8 is enough

True, true
And before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to D-Whiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginning
What's up to Rock-N-Will from the Hard Pack Crew
Peace to Mase Murder and the B.B.O. Crew
The Best Out Crew, the M&M Crew
And all the other crews that's representin in Harlem
You know what I'm sayin?
And last but not least
I gotta say peace to the 139th Street NFL Crew
My crew

When we pull up we back to back, in European cars

Make a hater go blind, once he see that blue line

So I suggest, that you chill with that plex shit
Cause you don't wanna be behind the barrel, when you see the tech spit

I need a dime like J-Lo, Vivica Fox
Put ice in her life, and some nice invisible rocks
Kyleon, the type that never like trashy chicks
No strippers just Moet sippers, classy chicks
The kind, that I can't let walk pass me chick
Do anything for her, as long as she ask me chick
Like flashy shit, DG Prada and Gucci clothes
And Victoria Secret silk panties, covers and ooh she knows
She never hang with movie hoes, dig dealers and X popping
She's not a bopper, that say she hop out of Lex droppers
She my sex doctor, good love she go hard in bed
Go down below my waist with her lips, and harden my head
I call her the warden in bed, she keep me on lock
Not only her, it's my game she keep me on top
A bad broad, she just might keep me on bops
But she love for daddy to hustle, that's why she keep me on blocks
That's why I love her mayn, uh

[Hook]
I need a dime broad, top of the line broad
A fine broad, fuck up a nigga mind broad
(I need a classy chick, mean a sassy chick
And when it's time to get freaky, she a nasty chick)
I need a play girl, down around the way girl
More than okay girl, help me get my pay girl
(I need a gangsta bitch, not a wanksta bitch
That's down to ride, but never in some gangsta shit)

[Slim Thug]
I need some'ing classy in the streets, but stone freak in the sheets
Caramel color, letter under six feet
Stand tall like a model, shaped like a Coke bottle
Smile, will make the hardest thug heart feel hollow
When she pass boys follow, trying to get at my chick
Richie Rich himself, couldn't get in my bitch
She not impressed by cash, boo got her own stash
Boo got her own house, bought her own S Class
Independent lady, still up for the babies
Could be the house wife or the Boss type, it's crazy
My boo go to church, three days a week
My boo put God first, everyday she see
She never dug, hanging out in the club
By ten she tucked in, waiting on Thug
Never hating on Thug, or what Thug do
Cause Thug would be a fool, if Thug don't stay tru to my boo

Only like modeling chicks, that's sleezy baby
Now um come closer, squeeze me baby
Get all that you can get, just release me baby
See I never cry to hoes, I just talk fly to hoes
Usually lie to hoes, bout buying 'em Prada clothes
If I do soon as they trip, they strip up out of those
Back to the sto' refund time, cause that's just how it goes
Now you know, I fuck 'em and leave 'em duck 'em and weave em
Listen to they sad stories, never fucking believe em
She got me sprung, waking up in the evening
Cause the night was incredible, sex was great she's unforgettable
The thought of her is endless, I just can't let it go
Therefor she's earned the position, to be that one I will settle fo'

Fin to put it all in why'all face

I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

Killa Kyleon,"Yea I'm gettin' money is my exclamation
The Lambo's milked out, no expiration
And I ain't ask for a estimation
I just pass the cake off, no hesitation
Ya see I'm nothin' like y'all guys
I just do the stuntin', y'all niggas fall guys
And everyday I get the benny washed
It's deja vu like denny wash
Budget too big, billionaire a hurt a label
Play it tight, spray the creed on the purple label
Pie vay settings, Jacob got me linked up
The Bentley wag bulletproof like a brinks truck
C.b.l, we don't care what ya homies sell
Rubberband around the stacks like a ponytail
I could meet a hoe sweeter than Damita Joe
She act conceited tho and I'm a get deleted yo
I'm not a musician, but I play a instrument
The ragin' bull handle any kind of incident
The black latex, D's can't get the print
The flyin' spur so fly, I had to get the bent
Got initials on the door scrap, initials on the floor mat
I ain't braggin' homeboy, dis my format
The 22's look like they ridin' on four flats
Young octopus, I carry arms
I draw to challengers, with Cavali carry-ons
Freck billionaire, I'm the 1 with the bling
Got canaries on the wrist, not the ones with the wings
A real hood nigga, I got a lavage flow
I could push you into theaters like magic tho
You don't want beef, you just want raps
I get ya lil' ass smoked like a blunt wrap
C.B.L spray, what da fuck did you thought
I tote the cig, but I don't mean Newport
I wash my money up the laundry way
I stay Gucci'd down even on my laundry day
The linen clean, splash ya ?
Double blue 62 smash ya limousine
You could set trip, but I get the ammo near
Like a bad alibi, switch up the lambo gear
These other rap niggas, they could'nt hold a candle near
They got it all screwed up, like chandeliers

I'm gettin' money is my quotation
Family man, so I need the lambo station
Slick talk, I'll put a chamber into rotation
Director style, I shoot em on location
My hoe's haitian, trenny and croatian
Ass clap louder than an oprah ovation
Double d's on her chest like daredevil
I shoot dames at a 900 a pair level
I'm in perotta, the color of ricotta
Cheese, please you can't tell me not a
I don't share keys, nor do I give her codes
I set run through records down on river road
Then I switched up, posted on palleysay
The denali stay, smellin' like cali grade
I come through bar, numba 9 squirts
Osama rich, that's the hard to find shirt
Ya rocks keep 2 they selves, well mines flirt
They 2 clean, board of health couldn't find dirt
I'm rich bitch, and I'm screamnin' it like ashy larry
They call me brinks boy, maybe it's the cash I carry
Rubberbands pop, you gon' need a scrungee for me
She a jump off, bet the chick a bungee for me
I came a long way, and I still stroll the avenues
Move and style, louis v roll and travel
Local nigga, you never been to poland have you,
So you couldn't judge me if you was holdon gavels
And I used to get the raw from olivia
That was back when raven symone was olivia
I did the take-out, meanin' that I ran orders
I had the transporter sittin' by the land borders
The rocafella a make you rather do a manslaughter
They goin' in June, it's comin' back with grand-daughters
So homie if you got a weapon tote it
You can't jump ship, niggas won't accept you boated
When I was doin' it 4 t.v, I kept it loaded
Cause these hatin' niggas try 2 find it and webisode it
A half of clip in ya hip, a make ya elvis shake
You'll more then moan when ya bones and ya pelvis break

Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby

March 11, 1981
My momma gave birth to a hell raising heavenly son
And my daddy was a fool addicted to brown
So he wasn't ever around, but my momma held me down

When me and big sister had nothing to eat
My momma gave up her last trying to make ends meet
She was a school teacher, working to provide for her fam'
Struggling in AA, to submit to gods plan

Them long twelve's steps of hardway are all on your own
No family, few friends, my momma was all alone
She did it for her children, struggling to make a living
And some how we still had food on thanksgiving

When I can barely talk momma taught me to pray
And right then I knew that we'd have a better life some day
She still give up her last just to see me smile
That's the definition of love for you child, I love my momma

[Chorus]

My momma was my role model, I had no father figure
Just a bunch of pipe dreams of being richer
But as times got tougher my life just got rougher
It hurts so bad to see me watch my momma suffer

Its so hard to cope when you so dead broke
So momma used to make me memorize the song quotes
In the middle of a session momma gave god praise
I knew what it meant to struggle at such an early age

Remember them days she barely earned minimum wage
But made sure I had new cloths to start the seventh grade
She met my step father, and walked down the aisle
I praised he sent somebody that would make my momma smile

He raised me as his own, he taught me to be a man
Adopted me and Anne, and gave momma a hand
I just love to see that beautiful smile on momma face
My momma could never be replaced, I love my momma

[Chorus]

20 years of struggling, done came to a close
No more old, torn up, and hand me down cloths
She deserve the best, and never nothing less
No stress, give my momma that Gucci dress

The times were hard but we done made it out the rain
The storm was severe but we overcame the hurricane
Them rainy days seem to last so long
When them times got hard my momma told me be strong

My number 1 supporter ever since day one
And still till this day momma would die for her son
No more slumz, all them rainy days are done
No a days we taking trips to Disney world just for fun

I put you in a Benz take you out that nova
Its been a long rough road, but that bumpy rides over
You raise me from a baby, my number 1 lady
And until the day I'm in my grave, ima stay mommas baby

Killa Mike,"[Chorus: Gucci Mane (Lil Scrappy): x2]
I rob in my black tee
Hit licks in my black tee
All in ya house searching for bricks in my black tee (Crank It)
I kill in my black tee
I steal in my black tee
I'm real so I gotta keep it trill in my black tee

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
You can catch me all in a nigga house wit a black tee
Gucci Mane, lil' flair got a million dollar mouthpiece
Black Tee, black rag, even got a black mask
Leaving out ya house, thirty pounds in my book bag
Black 'lac, black tag, fin' to hit a lick again
You a head bussa put yo hand wit yo fist den
Franchise hate me, probably wanna kill me
Remixed it wit Scrappy and now the hood feel me
Fresh on the scene wit the all black shirt
Gucci so gutter he'll steal money out ya purse
Lay up in ya yard, rob ya when ya go to church
Ya love white tees now ya face on the shirt
Black tee, black beat, trapping on the front street
Got a black pistol grip pump on the seat
Black tee, O.G., nigga don't approach me
Bubble gum wappin' ass niggas can't smoke me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
It's Bun B in his black tee & G in his black tee
Repping UGK and BAT in his black tee
Pimp in his black tee, mack in his black tee
Free Pimp C on the back of his black tee
Gucci chain swinging on the front of his black tee
Cadillac swinging, smoking blunts in his black tee
Stunt in his black tee, Ball in his black tee
It ain't just me pimping we all got a black tee

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
And I got a 1-2 Bun
Got 36 O's for the 2-1
Jeezy bout them green guys
Got H-town going for the ten or fives
I'm talking cornflakes
Black inner tubes wrapped in black duck tape
Say it again dog to make sure that you heard me
Got my four-x black tee up under my jersey

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
I got the all black Chevy on all black rims
Keep a small black gat in my all black Tims
On the all-black leather there's a all-black mack
Trying to snatch get ya black ass blowed the fuck back
44 to ya torso 4 in ya hat
Kick doja to ya house n put it to a cataract
Gorillas wit banana clips going monkey in the back
They'll put yo ass in that black box, laid out flat

[Verse 5: Jody Breeze]
Look I slang in my white but I bang in my black tee
Gucci on the front, Jody Breeze on the back street
Chilling by a black Cadillac on sum black feet
Scrappy in a Chevy watching Scarface on the flat screen
Told y'all constantly, ride wit the pump wit me
Yup in my black tee, wit the nine underneath
I ain't gotta keep telling y'all niggas I'ma G
I'ma just cock back and leave sum blood on ya teeth

[Chorus]

[Verse 6: 4-Tre]
I'm s-stainless in my black tee
Remaining in my black tee
On the grind cause I like to shine in my black tee
Diamond glistening cross plus the background is a black tee
Thieve then come back spraying rounds in my black tee
4-Tre, I want war in my black tee
Fuck them, probably never wore a black tee
Working in my black tee, smoking purple in my black tee
I'm looking for twelve all out yo curtain in my black tee

[Verse 7: Lil Scrappy]
Fuck a white tee, I got my black tee and vest on
Fuck a sturdy shot, I'm going straight for the bread home
I don't know why y'all niggas dropped move b
Cause now Raheem'll show ya punk ass a tree
Bust nuts in my black tee, sluts in my black tee
Now I'm smoking nothing but blunts in my black tee
Saw me in Valve then tried to fight me
Just the same monkey shorty don't take me lightly

[Chorus]",Black Tee,2008
Killa Sha,"The invincible huh? Yeah ya'll be seein it
It is what it is indeed Stoupie
Ya'll be knowin huh? Let 'em know

Hold the device tight, when it's time for a mic fight
You're a pagan tryin to battle someone who's Christ-like
The precise knight that smash you with a white pipe
Left you bleeding into the ocean under the night's light
Oh you hype right? Well meet the soul benders
Cop that or get shot at like goaltenders
You roll benches till playin fear was fair game
Ya'll got fucked up like sex on an airplane
That's why we can't change, we just ill
We blow trees, sip Ole E's and spit real
The clip's filled with the wraith that Cain saw
Then I slash with a leather mask and chainsaw
That's why the brain's raw, that's why your veins pour
That's why you copped my shit nine times at the same store
That's why you Entered the Dragon and got slashed
And that's why the Hologram counting up cash. What!?

Holocaust, rap javelin toss Killasha's the boss
I take what's yours, pour poison in your pores
I'm down for the cause my nigga, not ""because""
My soul wasn't made to be lost, stop for the pause
I play 48 minutes hard without the calls
Slicin elbows through ya jaw, need I say more?
Facinating with 44s and foul whores
Large gram cookups, and the ill drug scores
My captivating verses, that'll open all doors
I soar like a condor ready for war, fuck the law!

Ominous leave your brain matter painted on ya Stainmaster
Game of Death motherfucker we draft ya, semi-autograph ya
Keepin L's lit, sendin pellets through helmets
Shells hit, you and the fag you share a cell with
Takin niggas out thier element rhyme fighters
Divine writers, time travellers, Sliders
Pale niggas act jail lifers
Who tell the active nail biters with the 12s in thier diapers
Shoes never walk nor land, explore land
I expose my scrolls and code it in Fortran
Bullets graze ya wig kid, brushes with death
I let the iron clutch grip the bones in ya flesh
Playin on ya wrist like strings on a violin
Dyin in a blood pool wrestlin Leviathan
Fuckin wit Gods, Jedi Mind Tricks
Y'all suckas like niggas born without dicks",Contra,2000
