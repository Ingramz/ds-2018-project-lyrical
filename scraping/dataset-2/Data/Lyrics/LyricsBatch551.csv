Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to japan quake losers and survivors
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to sound better but the killer was a Coward
Face just showers, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news all day went sour
Lil' mama got me feeling like a limit here
Put you in the box just the presidents cigarettes
Give em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers just the young and restless
Get mad 'cause the quarter million on my necklace

You and I or jealously was not oppressive

Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Rihanna kiss you on ya neck just kill critics

Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Mr Mike Caren, tell his Billie Jeans
I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries

You make me glow, but I cover up
Won’t let it show, so I’m
Puttin’ my defences up
'Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think I’d have a heart attack 
I think I’d have a heart attack 

Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And everytime I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It’s just not fair
Pain’s more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume
For you, make me so nervous
That I just can’t hold your hand

You make me glow, but I cover up

They’re burning, I’d rather be numb
And there’s no one else to blame
So scared I take off and I run
I’m flying too close to the sun
And I burst into flames

You make me glow, but I cover up
Won’t let it show, so I’m
Puttin’ my defences up

We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)

The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance

How he came to life one day

For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance around

She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home

To carry love, to carry stories of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love

Kieran Kane,"His daddy said when he was a baby
He was impossible to hold
He'd fuss and fight and then he'd giggle all night
Terrify the whole household

But he'd listen to his bedtime stories
He believed what he was told
About gypsy camps, saddle tramps
And rainbow gold

He had about a million questions
Liked to drove everybody wild
He'd ask them stuff that was just too tough
They all told him, ""hush up child""

So it came as no surprise
When he left his home so young
Looking for some kind of paradise
I don't know what else he could have done

He was a scholar
Though he never really went to school
He stood amazed at the world's ways
And he followed the golden rule

He knew a little bit about everything
He could pretty much guess the rest
And he always seemed to know what you mean
If you took him in your confidence

Now most people run around in circles
But he ran a real straight line
The only thing wrong was that before too long
He left everyone who loved him behind

So it came as no surprise
When he left his home so young
Looking for some kind of paradise
Looking for something that he hadn't already done

Well he got to be hard to keep track of
Everybody was a little confused
And then one time the old grapevine
Whispered the strangest news

Now maybe he didn't mean to do it
I understand it if you've got your doubts
But I got a good idea that the coast was clear
And he figured he'd just bust on out

Now friends I'm not saying that it was a good thing
I'm not saying that it makes much sense
I just know that he was the kind to cross every line
Jump every single last fence

So it comes as no surprise
That he left his home so young
Still looking for some kind of paradise
The fool thought he had to go all the way to kingdom come

The only thing that I really wonder about now
Keeps running across my mind
If he ever caught his breath between his birth and death

If he ever caught his breath between birth and death
I swear I don't know where he ever found the time

Like a fatherless devil, like a motherless child
Lord when you left me, it felt like you cut me in two
For awhile while I was loving you",While I Was Loving You,2000
Kieran Kane,"Well the midnight train can come and go without me;
No I don't need no taxi back to town.
I think I'll just stay right here in this deep old light,
I was supposed to meet someone here tonight,
I'm sittin' here thinking,
Waiting on a dark-eyed gal.

Well, I don't mind the rain; I never even noticed
And I don't feel the cold, it wouldn't matter anyhow,
As a matter of fact I could stay until the break of day,
I don't see as I'm in anybody's way;
I'm just sittin' here thinkin',
Waiting on a dark eyed gal.

She said she'd meet me at the station,
I don't believe she'll keep me waiting very long
Very long.

She never told me if she was coming with me
Or if she only meant to say her last farewell
Never was one to let me know her mind
So I'll stay right here, keep doing my time
Just sitting here thinkin',
Waiting on a dark eyed gal.

The midnight train has come and gone without me now,
But I don't need no taxi back to town.
Matter of fact I could stay until the break of day
I don't see as I'm in anybody's way
Now I'm sittin' here thinkin',
Waiting on a dark eyed gal;
Yes I'm just sitting here drinkin',

Kieran Kane,"Back on Blue Mountain snow is melting
And the creek is running fast
There's deer's grazing in the meadow
After a long winter's passed

And I'm hillbilly blue
I'm hillbilly blue
See I'm hillbilly blue
I'm hillbilly blue

I'm here on the front lines
Every day is like a war
No matter how hard I'm working
Everybody wants a little more

Kieran Kane,"History lesson number one
There's not a thing that can't be done
Somewhere in this world of doubt
Someone's gonna work it out
There you go just like that

We learned to crawl we learned to walk
We learned to fly at Kitty Hawk
Next thing you know one afternoon
We're driving golf balls on the moon
There you go just like that
We've learned how to take our dreams
And turn 'em into fine machines
But there's one thing we haven't done
We haven't learned to live as one

We stand behind our borderlines
And talk about it all the time
History lesson number two
Not what you say but what you do
There you go just like that

We try to find the peace through war
Although it's never worked before
If we want peace we've got to start
To heal the hurt in every heart

There you go just like that",Just Like That,2004
Kieran Kane,"If life is like a candle bright
Then death must be the wind
You know you can close your window tight
And it still comes blowing in

So I will climb the highest hill
And I'll watch the rising sun
And I pray that I won't feel the chill
Till I'm too old to die young

[Chorus]
Let me watch my children grow
To see what they become
Lord don't let that cold wind blow
Till I'm too old to die young

I have had some real good friends
I thought would never die
But now all that I got left of them
Are these tear drops in my eyes

So if I could have one wish today
And I know it would be done
I'd say everyone could stay
Till they're too old too die young

Kieran Kane,"Old dirty dog walking down the street
No shadow did he cast
Clock on the wall
No hands at all
No present, no future, no past

You can't save everybody
No word, no deed, no praise
You can't save everybody
Everybody don't want to be saved

Old headstones, old buried bones
Just laying 'round cemetery deep
I'm burning matches
For the sake of making ashes
Just trying to get some sleep

With words that don't make no sense

Kieran Kane,"Someday we’ll roll away the stone that we’ve carried for so long
All our burdens will be gone, and I can’t wait
We will find our way to an understanding of all views
No prayer shall be refused, I can’t wait

It seems we’ve gone too far now we don’t know where we are
I believe we’ll find a guiding star, but I can’t wait
If faith is the final place where all fears have been erased
And the locks have fallen from the gates, I can’t wait.

Listen, now you gon' have to explain to me how the Lord love a little sinner like me
I've been over-stressin', I've been second guessin'
I was on them Xan's for a second, I was feelin' so defeated
I thought I was a leader
Hurt so many people, all I see is teardrops when I try to go to sleep
I heard you had a soft spot for the black sheep
Offer me forgiveness while I struggle to receive it
Now would you still love me if I took her home last night?
Smokin' and sippin' on that Patrón last night?
If I was poppin' pills tryna cop a thrill?
And I know I'm wrong but I do it 'cause it feels so right
Would I, would I still be a child?
And would you still be around?
If I'm sick of church and tired of prayin'?

Uh, she prolly too hard on herself (self)
She put the blame all on herself (self)
She run into the arms of another man ('nother man)
And she done gave her heart to another man ('nother man)
She know she ain't the woman that she wanna be
Can't look in the mirror 'cause she don't see what she wanna see
She gave her love away too many times
Heard too many lies, she don't got no tears left to cry, yeah
Somewhere, she got a little child, but
She ain't see him in a while, now
She gave her baby to the system
Dealin' with her demons, she was fightin' her addiction
And this is all fact, not fiction
Prayin' that the Lord could really fix it
Said the last time was the last time
But the last time got her feelin' like the Devil's mistress, but listen

It's not easy, when you gotta face yourself
Truth is, I don't deserve not one bit of help
Promise that your lovin' never leave
Once you've seen all of me
It's just so hard to believe it all but for grace

Kierra Sheard,"Whenever I had the nerve to think that I had outgrown my teacher
Or I was living too good to listen to the preacher
You'd make it so that I would realize my disillusion
Then I'd have to re-evaluate some things, oh I

At one time, I was truly a circumstantial kind of praiser
Only when things were going good, I'd lift my voice in worship
Forgetting when all of the chips were down, who faithfully
Stayed around and helped me out, Lord, I don't know how?

At times I lost sight of my faith
At times I tried but I found it hard to wait on You
Many times I have taken things in my own hands
And messed up bad, so here I am singing

This is me, in my entirety
This is me, a person saved by grace
Humbly, confessing, with You I'm something
But without You I'm nothing, Lord

This is me, so plain and ordinary
This is me, minus everything fancy
Placed simply here to give You praises
And give honor to Your name

Through trials, You mold me I'm forever a work of art in progress
Though I don't always seem to see it, yes, it does manifest
It's just so evidently no one can deny that You're the One
Working through me, so I can be what You called me

With thoughts of faith, I read Your word and boldly claim my blessings
And with my whole heart I will worship You for simply being
Above all things, the morning star that brings light and hope for me
Lord, I really need Thee

At times, I lost sight of my faith
At times, I tried but I found it hard to wait on You

Placed simply here to give You praises
And give honor to Your name

I pray that You forgive me for the times I
Couldn't take at Your word, word, Lord
I am willing to give my everything
Everything to please Thee

Lord, Your grace is more than sufficient
And as for Your will for me, I accept it
And who I am in You, I'm confident and I believe
Please hear me, I come to Thee

Kiesza,"Mr. Worldwide, I just want to welcome everybody to my life
It's heaven on earth, but it's one hell of a ride
Kiesza, let's show everybody why love is a battlefield
Tell them how you feel

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demand
Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield

Closed the Grammys and got all the credits, literally
But I'm a hustler boy, you can't rid of me
I'm not religious but my passport looks like a bible
Presidential debates unreliable
Politicians want to politick and politrick
That's why I call this shit politricks
I'm a young man, old soul
I can't listen to this new school shit to me it's just so-so
I did my own thing, created my own lane
I may not like the players, but I love the game
I love the hustle and that's real
And that's why love is a battlefield

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demand
Love is a battlefield
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield

Born in Miami, Cuban boy in the '80s
Took over the game and they thought we were crazy
You name it we did, we bought it, we sipped it, we run it
Let all these public traded companies know that we're coming
David vs. Goliath, live in the flesh, Armando Perez, boy am I blessed
I learned from the worst, but listened to the best
Figure out that riddle and figure out success
I did my own thing, created my own lane
I may not like the players, but I love the game
I love the hustle and that's real
And that's why love is a battlefield

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demand
Love is a battlefield
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield",We Are Strong,2017

Kiki & Herb,"Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name

Kiki Dee,"Ain't got no trouble in my life,
 No foolish dream to make me cry.
 I'm never frightened or worried,
 I know I'll always get by.

 Catch a hold of my blues and just play them.

Kiki Dee,"When a dear old friend came by today
We sure had a lot to say
Of the time we had so long ago
When answers to a dream were all we needed

To glide along our time
We remember, when you and I were fine
In the night hours
There's a look of sadness in your eyes

As you look at me in recollection
I don't know what you're thinking of
Then you smile
Say ""You're looking good, sweet love""

And we glide along our time
We remember, when you and I were standing
We were standing
In the fading shadows

Play that song
The one that made me cry
Sing along your harmonies
Before you say goodbye

There's a look of sadness in my eyes
As I see you now in my reflection
And the time so long ago is clearer now
So we take it kinda slow

And we glide along our time
And something still remains
When you shared your pain with someone
So long ago

So long ago
In the night hours
(In) the night hours

Kiki Dee,"We've all heard a million stories
Some of them will touch you at the heart
Some of them will leave you cold leave you cold
It's been two long days now
She's starring at the stars
Where's that child of mine tonight
When her soul gets too heavy
she needs to laugh out loud again
Now it's time to let her go
(chorus)
Listen to the story of a mother and daughter
(Suno suno ma aur beti ki kahani)
But they both feel the silence under the night sky
The messenger has taken flight
Delivering her from a weary heart
delivering a world of change a world of change
She's scared as a rabbit starring into a head light
Hell bent on her own way
Her mind's a million miles away
Mama don't be afraid it's a road I have to follow
Now it's time to let her go
Beautiful sky shining on me
Bring her back home
Bring her back home to me
Home back home

Change the night through an open door 
I'm awake but this not my home 
For the first time I'm not alone 

Reaching out, I touch another skin 
Breathing out as he is breathing in 
Deep inside I feel my soul aflame 
Can my life ever be the same?

I should have told him 
I'd do anything if I could hold him 
For just another day, for just another day 
His love is something I will not forget 
When I am far away, when I am far away 
I feel the rainfall of another planet 
Another planet 

Close together in the afterglow 
I remember how his loving flow 
Turned the key into another world 
Made a woman of a simple girl 

Daylight comes as we both know it must 
Soon my fantasies will turn to dust 
But I would give him anything he asked 
If my first love could be my last 

I should have told him 
I'd do anything if I could hold him 
For just another day, for just another day

I wish I was a poet, so that I could express,
What I, what I like to say,
I wish I was an artist, so that I could paint a picture
Of how I feel, how I feel today, today
My love has no walls on either side,
That makes my love whiter than white,
I'm in the middle, no and I can't hide,

Kiki Dee Band,"Well you'll know what it is when you've found it
It hits you right between the eyes
And you won't find another way around it
''cause the dark's standing in the light
Well it shortens the range of your vision
So you can't even see your hands
And it stands on one leg and just listens -
Don't talk ''cause it understands.
You need help, I'm coming
Over the hill, to set you free
You need help, hold on now
Gonna save you if you wait for me.
Well you won't hear a shout or a whisper
When it moves it'll make no sound
But you'll know what it is when it hits you
By the time that you reach the ground
You need help, I'm coming
Over the hill, to set you free
You need help, hold on now
Gonna save you if you wait for me.
[repeat]
When it's past four o'cIock in the morning
And the moon begins to wane
Try to run if you get any warning
Watch out here it comes again.
Do you hear?
It's getting near
It's coming close
Don't look now
It's standing by your shoulder
You need help - here I come
Hold one 'cause here I come.

Jag vet ju att du fanns
Innan jag fick se dig
Visst fanns det andra i mitt liv
Men mer än tidsfördriv
Det kunde ingen ge mig
Men idag känner jag
Något som jag aldrig känt
Jag kan se att det är nåt som hänt

Du ger mig bra vibrationer
Varje gång du tar min hand i din
Och varje gång du ler
Så får jag bra vibrationer
Som kan leda till nåt mycket mer
Och jag tror kärleken är på väg
Med stora steg

Vi möttes bara härom dan
Men jag har blivit van
Att ha dig i min närhet
Fast du är mera än en vän
Är det för tidigt än
Att kalla det för kärlek
Och vi har mycket kvar
Vi har bara börjat nu
Men i natt vet jag att det är du

Och varje gång du ler
Så får jag bra vibrationer
Som kan leda till nåt mycket mer
Och jag tror kärleken är på väg

Om man är snabb att säga 'ja'
Men det är faktiskt ganska svårt att säga 'nej'

Kikki Danielsson,"Tumble out of bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping
Out on the street the traffic starts jumping
With folks like me on the job from nine to five

Nine to five, what a way to make a living
Barely getting by; it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind, and they never give you credi
It's enough to drive you crazy, if you let it

They let you dream just to watch them shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn, and it's all gonna roll your way

Nine to five, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead, but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me

Nine to five--they've got you where they want you
There's a better life and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it

Kiko Veneno,"Gather your deeds and your possessions,
Whatever certainty you've known.
Forget your heroes,
You don't really need those last few lessons.

Stand in the open,
The next voice you hear will be your own.

How right they knew that they could hurt you,
And you let them cut you to the bone.
But, God forbid, you allow them to rid you of your virtue.
Forget their laughter,
The next voice you hear will be your own.

The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear will be your own.

Throw down your truth and check your weapons.
Don't look to see if you're alone. 
Just stand your ground,
And don't turn around, whatever happens.
Don't ask directions,

Well the silver-dollar hairstyle been cut down
The silver-dollar hairstyle been cut down
Amazing that the feeling's still around

My good friend Friar wore a powder-blue suit with criss-cross lurex thread
He turned seventeen bought a big motorcycle and started wearing leather instead

With a silver-dollar hairstyle been cut down

Amazing that the feeling's still around

Rum and black at the Bell Hotel 
Stroll into the park, for a chumber in the dark, little juvenile never-do-well
Run a steel comb along the Regent jukebox, a little bit of thieving now and then

Kiley Dean,"Listen, first, you must travel, a long, desolate road
This road that you shall travel, will seem like nowhere.
That nowhere, will turn into somewhere
Keep your head up Bubba, don't let nobody get you down,
Cause that road you travel will turn around

I've accepted every challenge, and risen to all occasions
A country boy that's got his shit like Randy Moss and Jason
Perhaps some of these numerals don't fit in ya'lls equation
If your opinions coincide with that you oughta save â??em
Lookin' for the greatest Southern rapper, fuck it period
Negative spirits they only keeping down a myriad 
Of Satan's substances, and my systems' still my wisdom
It never once compromised that between God and I
Never once forgotten my manners
Cause my ma'ama played in public housin' in Alabama
But she had a diff'rent plan for me, russ and ginger
Thank the lord for Jimmy Mathis, pops he must remember us
Are you really down when those other clowns disappear
Taught me how to set the scope, shoot and leave with the deer
Man made me drink the blood, and showed me life was precious
The muddy road from nowhere to somewhere is my direction

I know what it's like to be nowhere
I know what it's like
I know what it's like to be nowhere
I know what it's like

Can you relate five kids, six fish sticks on the plate
All writin' to Santa Claus, I guess he got the list too late
Or to catch the fish you bait the hook with lil' Dylan's poo-poo
On Mr. Allen's property, he catch you, he will shoot you
Let these cats amuse you with comical depictions
But where I'm from being broke is no honorable affliction
Love some Jimmy Carter, but we never even voted
But slum is still slum, so you best believe we told it
Every five armed from AK's to 30-30's
And from live watch to live stock they pays the early birdy
Thus we worked the land like you worked the block with yayo
But I choose keys over cattle cause the profits way more
But I might get locked away though peddling the sno cones
So we keep it simplified with papers of that homegrown
It's the finest shine that you can find on this side of Memphis
From east nowhere to west somewhere still the grind is endless

[Chorus]

It all comes down to this, one last chance to advance
Beyond the second round of the big dance, all my plans
Of being viewed as something special, more than just the other one
We'll vanish from the papers and the plague the South has suffered from
The world's weight plus a ton, restin' on my shoulders
But what's attractive, to ease my nerve, is blessed to the beholder
Cause Eminem's incredible, but did I really need to say this
For ya'll to leave my soul at rest and add me to your playlist
But this time I may just, leap and clear that hurdle man
Cause there's gonna be a million more, who knows if they'll be worth a damn
Bubba K, I surely am, with that silky kinda sound
Carson Daily host it out, I'll be early for this time around
Cause I've come to far for my own mistakes to quell me
Cause looking back at self improvement proves an aching ailment 
Cause nothing they can tell me will get me somewhere in a hurry
If I'm nowhere, then that nowhere will leave me no more need to worry",Nowhere,2003

How did it disappear? It all happened so fast. (1st chorus) It came out of silence, but ended in a war. You took this time of my life spent, and threw it out the door. Do you still think of me, is it still in the air? Do you still think of me, do you even care? (2nd verse) It happened without warning, so calm before the storm. Ending day or breaking dawn, again my feelings torn. Even though it hurts me, I still remember the days. How good you made me feel, I lost count of the ways. (2nd chorus) If I could speak to you, I might feel better. So I just wrote this song, instead of a letter. Do you still think of me, Am I part of your day? Do You still think of me, Are you doing OK?

",Last Song,2001
Kill Your Idols,"

At age 41, the king was dead
It wasn't the beginning or the end
Shouting for his freedom
He was silenced again
Maybe for the last time
The government
Just couldn't stand
To see their morals questioned
Another example of non freedom of speech
""he needs to be silenced""
In 1962 he plead guilty
To the lies of the state
After years of urging rebellion
He moved out west
A peaceful existence?
I don't think so
Retreated, lost and beaten
He sunk into depression
Losing battles to bottles
No money for bills
And no will to live
New years 1965 is when he collapsed
And the bottle toook his life
At age 43 he died alone and broke
With nothing but his family
A physical existence can be erased
But true legends never die
And where were his friends
When the end took him away?
No where to be found he gave it
A name and direction ""rock and roll""
End: I hope its true that when we die
We can look back on what we have done
Because I think Alan Freed would be glad to know
That the rebellion still carries on
Whenever someone raises their middle finger
And goes against the norm
I hope he knows that he didn't die in vain
Its not goodbye, just goodnight

Killa Kam,"Yo
My crew is in the house
Terra, Herb McGruff, Buddah Bless
Big Twan, Killa Cam, Trooper J, and Mike Boogie
And I'mma set it like this

Aiyo, folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast, when my Smith-Wes' blast
So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don't get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smirk, cause these knuckles hurt
I'm from the alley, not the valley
I'm hotter than Cali, wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally, I rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don't hang with jive pals
Adios, ghost, I'm 5 thous'

Well, I'm flav, and I was down with the crime wave
Now it's time saved, yo, cause now I'm a rhyme slave
In '87 I sold cracks, collected some dough stacks
Hold gats, a joker got his soul taxed
Innovated, rappers you know who made it
Tell the Terra to rotate it, his raps are gold-plated
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother, I leave your rhyme trash gutter
I'm more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that Lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow-up
Sour luck, niggas got and popped and swallow nuts

For those that don't know, yo, I'm Herb McGruff
I'm on some murder stuff
And when I talk every verb is rough
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise, break bones
Then wind up bloody in a bodybag
MC's are live, but I'm mad liver
Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice and peas
(Herb, can you fight?) Yo, I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from hell
I'm the fuck up outta here

Aiyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews cause I'm bad news
In a mad mood I'm serving brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
Cause I'm no maricon, for poems I slide the hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Aiyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice
And cold take a fag's life
My swellin melon got niggas jealin
Aiyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin niggas lives like a felon

Yo, I bust chumps like a Glock 10, when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill the show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail
Been no frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail
Yeah, ain't I nasty, too nasty to trash me
Bash me, aiyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that sawed-off
And when I let slugs out, you will get rugged out
For dissin, you come up missing like a cub scout

Rappers be funny like Flex, cause they section's 80 slaughter, son
Talk about nines and tecs, and never shot a watergun
But Killa Kam, I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease cause once I release
My crew from the east, we leavin at least
20 police deceased, it's the beast on attack
So make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats and black macs
On Lenox Ave. ain't no light looks, you fight crooks
Left and right hooks, if you front, get your life took

I'm havin nail-sharp pains in my brain like a hellraiser
I'm blazin trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin but lead
Boom-bye-bye, dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up, and keep my head straight

I should never rhyme cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones and sendin' niggas hoppin' home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're come to see me, nigga, bring a cast and crutches
And niggas, I dont' need a gun for you, none of you
Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their muthafuckin' ass to ash
No need to question am I nice, cause it's a fact, friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a Mac-10
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough
Peace to Big L, ayo, 8 is enough

True, true
And before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to D-Whiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginning
What's up to Rock-N-Will from the Hard Pack Crew
Peace to Mase Murder and the B.B.O. Crew
The Best Out Crew, the M&M Crew
And all the other crews that's representin in Harlem
You know what I'm sayin?
And last but not least
I gotta say peace to the 139th Street NFL Crew
My crew

Richie Rich himself, couldn't get in my bitch
She not impressed by cash, boo got her own stash
Boo got her own house, bought her own S Class
Independent lady, still up for the babies
Could be the house wife or the Boss type, it's crazy
My boo go to church, three days a week
My boo put God first, everyday she see
She never dug, hanging out in the club
By ten she tucked in, waiting on Thug
Never hating on Thug, or what Thug do
Cause Thug would be a fool, if Thug don't stay tru to my boo

Even though it ain't Hova, breathe easy baby
It's the realest of the real, see-Weezie baby
You's a fake trick, if you tease me baby
Only like modeling chicks, that's sleezy baby
Now um come closer, squeeze me baby
Get all that you can get, just release me baby
See I never cry to hoes, I just talk fly to hoes
Usually lie to hoes, bout buying 'em Prada clothes
If I do soon as they trip, they strip up out of those
Back to the sto' refund time, cause that's just how it goes
Now you know, I fuck 'em and leave 'em duck 'em and weave em
Listen to they sad stories, never fucking believe em
She got me sprung, waking up in the evening
Cause the night was incredible, sex was great she's unforgettable
The thought of her is endless, I just can't let it go
Therefor she's earned the position, to be that one I will settle fo'

Ya boy got the drug money we be stackin' on

Beemin' through the tints when I'm sittin' in the ""Phenom""

But this tiger stripe watch make this bitch a Bengals fan

The denali stay, smellin' like cali grade
I come through bar, numba 9 squirts
Osama rich, that's the hard to find shirt
Ya rocks keep 2 they selves, well mines flirt
They 2 clean, board of health couldn't find dirt
I'm rich bitch, and I'm screamnin' it like ashy larry
They call me brinks boy, maybe it's the cash I carry
Rubberbands pop, you gon' need a scrungee for me
She a jump off, bet the chick a bungee for me
I came a long way, and I still stroll the avenues
Move and style, louis v roll and travel
Local nigga, you never been to poland have you,
So you couldn't judge me if you was holdon gavels
And I used to get the raw from olivia
That was back when raven symone was olivia
I did the take-out, meanin' that I ran orders
I had the transporter sittin' by the land borders
The rocafella a make you rather do a manslaughter
They goin' in June, it's comin' back with grand-daughters
So homie if you got a weapon tote it
You can't jump ship, niggas won't accept you boated
When I was doin' it 4 t.v, I kept it loaded
Cause these hatin' niggas try 2 find it and webisode it
A half of clip in ya hip, a make ya elvis shake
You'll more then moan when ya bones and ya pelvis break

And spend most of my weekends cruising above clouds

Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me

Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me

Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me

March 11, 1981
My momma gave birth to a hell raising heavenly son
And my daddy was a fool addicted to brown
So he wasn't ever around, but my momma held me down

When me and big sister had nothing to eat
My momma gave up her last trying to make ends meet
She was a school teacher, working to provide for her fam'
Struggling in AA, to submit to gods plan

Them long twelve's steps of hardway are all on your own
No family, few friends, my momma was all alone
She did it for her children, struggling to make a living
And some how we still had food on thanksgiving

When I can barely talk momma taught me to pray
And right then I knew that we'd have a better life some day
She still give up her last just to see me smile
That's the definition of love for you child, I love my momma

[Chorus]

My momma was my role model, I had no father figure
Just a bunch of pipe dreams of being richer
But as times got tougher my life just got rougher
It hurts so bad to see me watch my momma suffer

Its so hard to cope when you so dead broke
So momma used to make me memorize the song quotes
In the middle of a session momma gave god praise
I knew what it meant to struggle at such an early age

Remember them days she barely earned minimum wage
But made sure I had new cloths to start the seventh grade
She met my step father, and walked down the aisle
I praised he sent somebody that would make my momma smile

He raised me as his own, he taught me to be a man
Adopted me and Anne, and gave momma a hand
I just love to see that beautiful smile on momma face
My momma could never be replaced, I love my momma

[Chorus]

20 years of struggling, done came to a close
No more old, torn up, and hand me down cloths
She deserve the best, and never nothing less
No stress, give my momma that Gucci dress

The times were hard but we done made it out the rain
The storm was severe but we overcame the hurricane
Them rainy days seem to last so long
When them times got hard my momma told me be strong

My number 1 supporter ever since day one
And still till this day momma would die for her son
No more slumz, all them rainy days are done
No a days we taking trips to Disney world just for fun

I put you in a Benz take you out that nova
Its been a long rough road, but that bumpy rides over
You raise me from a baby, my number 1 lady
And until the day I'm in my grave, ima stay mommas baby

Holocaust, rap javelin toss Killasha's the boss
I take what's yours, pour poison in your pores
I'm down for the cause my nigga, not ""because""
My soul wasn't made to be lost, stop for the pause
I play 48 minutes hard without the calls
Slicin elbows through ya jaw, need I say more?
Facinating with 44s and foul whores
Large gram cookups, and the ill drug scores
My captivating verses, that'll open all doors
I soar like a condor ready for war, fuck the law!

""Raindrops on the ground""

Ominous leave your brain matter painted on ya Stainmaster
Game of Death motherfucker we draft ya, semi-autograph ya
Keepin L's lit, sendin pellets through helmets
Shells hit, you and the fag you share a cell with
Takin niggas out thier element rhyme fighters
Divine writers, time travellers, Sliders
Pale niggas act jail lifers
Who tell the active nail biters with the 12s in thier diapers
Shoes never walk nor land, explore land
I expose my scrolls and code it in Fortran
Bullets graze ya wig kid, brushes with death
I let the iron clutch grip the bones in ya flesh
Playin on ya wrist like strings on a violin
Dyin in a blood pool wrestlin Leviathan
Fuckin wit Gods, Jedi Mind Tricks
Y'all suckas like niggas born without dicks",Contra,2000
