Jacques Brel,"Rêver un impossible rêve
Porter le chagrin des départs
Brûler d'une possible fièvre
Partir où personne ne part

Aimer jusqu'à la déchirure
Aimer, même trop, même mal,
Tenter, sans force et sans armure,
D'atteindre l'inaccessible étoile

Telle est ma quête,
Suivre l'étoile
Peu m'importent mes chances
Peu m'importe le temps
Ou ma désespérance
Et puis lutter toujours
Sans questions ni repos
Se damner
Pour l'or d'un mot d'amour
Je ne sais si je serai ce héros
Mais mon cœur serait tranquille
Et les villes s'éclabousseraient de bleu
Parce qu'un malheureux

Brûle encore, bien qu'ayant tout brûlé
Brûle encore, même trop, même mal
Pour atteindre à s'en écarteler
Pour atteindre l'inaccessible étoile.",La Quête,1968
Jacques Brel,"Bien sûr, il y a les guerres d´Irlande
Et les peuplades sans musique
Bien sûr, tout ce manque de tendre
Et il n´y a plus d´Amérique
Bien sûr, l´argent n´a pas d´odeur
Mais pas d´odeur vous monte au nez
Bien sûr, on marche sur les fleurs
Mais, mais voir un ami pleurer!

Bien sûr, il y a nos défaites
Et puis la mort qui est tout au bout
Nos corps inclinent déjà la tête
Étonnés d´être encore debout
Bien sûr, les femmes infidèles
Et les oiseaux assassinés
Bien sûr, nos cœurs perdent leurs ailes
Mais, mais voir un ami pleurer!

Bien sûr, ces villes épuisées
Par ces enfants de cinquante ans
Notre impuissance à les aider
Et nos amours qui ont mal aux dents
Bien sûr, le temps qui va trop vite
Ces métro remplis de noyés
La vérité qui nous évite
Mais, mais voir un ami pleurer!

Bien sûr, nos miroirs sont intègres
Ni le courage d´être juif
Ni l´élégance d´être nègre
On se croit mèche, on n´est que suif
Et tous ces hommes qui sont nos frères
Tellement qu´on n´est plus étonné
Que, par amour, ils nous lacèrent
Mais, mais voir un ami pleurer!",Voir un Ami Pleurer,1977
Jacques Brel,"Les soirs où je suis Argentin
Je m'offre quelques Argentines
Quitte à cueillir dans les vitrines
Des jolis quartiers d'Amsterdam
Des lianes qui auraient ce teint de femme
Qu'exportent vos cités latines
Ces soirs-là je les veux félines
Avec un rien de brillantine
Collée au ""ceveu"" de la langue
Elles seraient fraîches comme des mangues
Et compenseraient leur maladresse
À coups de poitrine et de fesses

Mais ce soir
Y a pas d'Argentines
Y a pas d'espoir
Y a pas d'doute
Non ce soir
Il pleut sur Knokke-le-Zoute
Ce soir comme tous les soirs
Je me rentre chez moi
Le cœur en déroute
Et la bite sous l'bras

Les soirs où je suis Espagnol
Petites fesses, grande bagnole
Elles passent toutes à la casserole
Quitte à pourchasser dans Hambourg
Des Carmencitas de faubourg
Qui nous reviennent de vérole
Je me les veux fraîches et joyeuses
Bonnes travailleuses sans parlotes
Mi-Andalouses, mi-anguleuses
De ces femelles qu'on gestapote
Parce qu'elles ne savent pas encore
Que Franco est tout à fait mort

Mais ce soir
Y a pas d'Espagnoles
Y a pas de casseroles
Y a pas d'doute
Non ce soir
Il pleut sur Knokke-le-Zoute
Ce soir comme tous les soirs
Je me rentre chez moi
Le cœur en déroute
Et la bite sous l'bras

Les soirs où je suis Caracas
Je Panama, je Partagas
Je suis l'plus beau
Je pars en chasse
Je glisse de palace en palace
Pour y dénicher le gros lot
Qui n'attend que mon coup de grâce
Je la veux folle comme un travelo
Découverte de vieux rideaux
Mais cependant t-évanescente
Elle m'attendrait depuis toujours
Cerclée de serpents et de plantes
Parmi les livres de Dutourd

Mais ce soir
Y a pas de Caracas
Y a pas de t-évanescentes
Y a pas d'doute
Mais ce soir
Il pleut sur Knokke-le-Zoute
Ce soir comme tous les soirs
Je me rentre chez moi
Le cœur en déroute
Et la bite sous l'bras

Demain oui
Peut être que
Peut être que demain je serai Argentin, oui
Je m'offrirai des Argentines
Quitte à cueillir dans les vitrines

Jacques Brel,"Ils s'aiment, s'aiment en riant
Ils s'aiment, s'aiment pour toujours
Ils s'aiment tout au long du jour
Ils s'aiment, s'aiment, s'aiment tant
Qu'on dirait des anges d'amour
Des anges fous se protégeant
Quand se retrouvent en courant
Les amants
Les amants de cœur
Les amants

Ils s'aiment, s'aiment à la folie
S'effeuillant à l'ombre des feux
Se découvrant comme deux fruits
Puis se trouvant n'être plus deux
Se dénouant comme velours
Se reprenant au petit jour
Et s'endormant les plus heureux
Les amants
Les amants de cœur
Les amants

Ils s'aiment, s'aiment en tremblant
Le cœur mouillé, le cœur battant
Chaque seconde est une peur
Qui croque le cœur entre ses dents
Ils savent trop de rendez-vous
Où ne vinrent que des facteurs
Pour n'avoir pas peur du loup
Les amants
Les amants de cœur
Les amants

Ils s'aiment, s'aiment en pleurant
Chaque jour un peu moins amants
Quand ils ont bu tout leur mystère
Deviennent comme sœur et frère
Brûlent leurs ailes d'inquiétude
Redeviennent deux habitudes
Alors changent de partenaire
Les amants
Les amants de cœur
Les amants

Qui s'aiment, s'aiment en riant
Qui s'aiment, s'aiment pour toujours
Qui s'aiment tout au long du jour
Qui s'aiment, s'aiment, s'aiment tant
Qu'on dirait des anges d'amour
Des anges fous se protégeant
Quand ils se retrouvent en courant

Jacques Brel,"Ne me quitte pas 
Il faut oublier 
Tout peut s'oublier 
Qui s'enfuit déjà 
Oublier le temps 
Des malentendus et le temps perdu 
À savoir comment 
Oublier ces heures 
Qui tuaient parfois à coups de pourquoi 
Le cœur du bonheur 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 

Moi je t'offrirai 
Des perles de pluie 
Venues de pays où il ne pleut pas 
Je creuserai la terre jusqu'après ma mort 
Pour couvrir ton corps d'or et de lumière 
Je ferai un domaine 
Où l'amour sera roi, où l'amour sera loi 
Où tu seras reine 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 

Ne me quitte pas 
Je t'inventerai 
Des mots insensés 
Que tu comprendras 
Je te parlerai 
De ces amants-la 
Qui ont vu deux fois leurs cœurs s'embraser 
Je te raconterai l'histoire de ce roi mort
De n'avoir pas pu te rencontrer 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 

On a vu souvent 
Rejaillir le feu 
D'un ancien volcan 
Qu'on croyait trop vieux 
Il est, paraît-il 
Des terres brûlées 
Donnant plus de blé 
Qu'un meilleur avril 
Et quand vient le soir 
Pour qu'un ciel flamboie 
Le rouge et le noir ne s'épousent-ils pas? 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 

Ne me quitte pas 
Je ne vais plus pleurer 
Je ne vais plus parler 
Je me cacherai là
À te regarder danser et sourire et 
À t'écouter chanter et puis rire 
Laisse-moi devenir l'ombre de ton ombre 
L'ombre de ta main 
L'ombre de ton chien 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas",Ne Me Quitte Pas,1991
Jacques Brel,"Elles sont notre premier ennemi
Quand elles s'échappent en riant
Des pâturages de l'ennui
Les biches
Avec des cils comme des cheveux
Des cheveux en accroche-faon
Et seulement le bout des yeux
Qui triche
Si bien que le chasseur s'arrête
Et que je sais des ouragans
Qu'elles ont changés en poètes
Les biches
Et qu'on les chasse de notre esprit
Ou qu'elles nous chassent en rougissant
Elles sont notre premier ennemi
Les biches de quinze ans

Elles sont notre plus bel ennemi
Quand elles ont l'éclat de la fleur
Et déjà la saveur du fruit
Les biches
Qui passent toute vertu dehors
Alors que c'est de tout leur cœur
Alors que c'est de tout leur corps
Qu'elles trichent
Lorsqu'elles grignotent le mari
Ou lorsqu'elles croquent le diamant
Sur l'asphalte bleu de Paris
Les biches
Qu'on les chasse à coups de rubis
Ou qu'elles nous chassent au sentiment
Elles sont notre plus bel ennemi
Les biches de vingt ans

Elles sont notre pire ennemi
Lorsqu'elles savent leur pouvoir
Mais qu'elles savent leur sursis
Les biches
Quand un chasseur est une chance
Quand leur beauté se lève tard
Quand c'est avec toute leur science
Qu'elles trichent
Trompant l'ennui plus que le cerf
Et l'amant avec l'autre amant
Et l'autre amant avec le cerf
Qui biche
Mais qu'on les chasse à la folie
Ou qu'elles nous chassent du bout des gants
Elles sont notre pire ennemi
Les biches d'après vingt ans

Elles sont notre dernier ennemi
Quand leurs seins tombent de sommeil
Pour avoir veillé trop de nuits
Les biches
Quand elles ont le pas résigné
Des pèlerins qui s'en reviennent
Quand c'est avec tout leur passé
Qu'elles trichent
Afin de mieux nous retenir
Nous qui ne servons à ce temps
Qu'à les empêcher de vieillir
Les biches
Mais qu'on les chasse de notre vie
Ou qu'elles nous chassent parce qu'il est temps
Elles restent notre dernier ennemi
Les biches de trop longtemps",Les Biches,1996
Jacques Brel,"Les Flamandes dansent sans rien dire
Sans rien dire aux dimanches sonnants
Les Flamandes dansent sans rien dire
Les Flamandes ça n'est pas causant
Si elles dansent, c'est parce qu'elles ont vingt ans
Et qu'à vingt ans il faut se fiancer
Se fiancer pour pouvoir se marier
Et se marier pour avoir des enfants
C'est ce que leur ont dit leurs parents
Le bedeau et même son Eminence

Que tout va bien, que poussent les enfants
Et le houblon et le blé dans le pré
Elles font la fierté de leurs parents
Du bedeau et de son Eminence

Les Flamandes dansent sans sourire
Sans sourire aux dimanches sonnants
Les Flamandes dansent sans sourire
Les Flamandes, ça n'est pas souriant
Si elles dansent, c'est qu'elles ont septante ans
Qu'à septante ans il est bon de montrer
Que tout va bien, que poussent les p'tits-enfants
Et le houblon et le blé dans le pré:
Toutes vêtues de noir comme leurs parents
Comme le bedeau et comme son Eminence
L'Archiprêtre qui radote au couvent
Elles héritent et c'est pour ça qu'elles dansent

Les Flamandes dansent sans mollir
Sans mollir aux dimanches sonnants

Et qu'à cent ans il est bon de montrer
Que tout va bien qu'on a toujours bon pied
Et bon houblon et bon blé dans le pré
Elles s'en vont retrouver leurs parents
Et le bedeau et même Son Eminence

À s'offrir en partage
Au jour du grand voyage

Pour unique chanson
Et unique secours

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour habiller matin
Pauvres et malandrins
De manteaux de velours

Quand on n'a que l'amour
À offrir en prière
Pour les maux de la terre
En simple troubadour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
À offrir à ceux-là
Dont l'unique combat
Est de chercher le jour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour parler aux canons
Et rien qu'une chanson
Pour convaincre un tambour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour tracer un chemin
À chaque carrefour

Nous aurons dans nos mains

Jacques Brel,"Nous étions deux amis et Fanette m'aimait
La plage était déserte et dormait sous juillet
Si elles s'en souviennent les vagues vous diront
Combien pour la Fanette j'ai chanté de chansons

Faut dire
Faut dire qu'elle était belle
Comme une perle d'eau
Faut dire qu'elle était belle
Et je ne suis pas beau

Faut dire
Faut dire qu'elle était brune
Tant la dune était blonde
Et tenant l'autre et l'une
Moi je tenais le monde

Faut dire
Faut dire que j'étais fou
De croire à tout cela
Je le croyais à nous
Je la croyais à moi

Faut dire
Qu'on ne nous apprend pas
A se méfier de tout

Nous étions deux amis et Fanette m'aimait
La plage était déserte et mentait sous juillet
Si elles s'en souviennent les vagues vous diront
Comment pour la Fanette s'arrêta la chanson

Faut dire
Faut dire qu'en sortant
D'une vague mourante
Je les vis s'en allant
Comme amant et amante

Faut dire
Faut dire qu'ils ont ri
Quand ils m'ont vu pleurer
Faut dire qu'ils ont chanté
Quand je les ai maudits

Faut dire
Que c'est bien ce jour-là
Qu'ils ont nagé si loin
Qu'ils ont nagé si bien
Qu'on ne les revit pas

Faut dire
Qu'on ne nous apprend pas
Mais parlons d'autre chose

Et le soir quelquefois, quand les vagues s'arrêtent
J'entends comme une voix
J'entends c'est la Fanette

Au sommet de la fortune

Tout fondre sous la lune

On est cent que la gloire 
Invite sans raison 
Mais quand meurt le hasard 
Quand finit la chanson

On est dix à coucher 
Dans le lit de la puissance 
Mais devant ces armées 
Qui s`enterrent en silence

Je deviens comme je le redoute
Chanteur pour femmes finissantes

Avec la voix bandonéante
D'un Argentin de Carcassonne
Même si on m'appelle Antonio
Que je brûle mes derniers feux
En échange de quelques cadeaux
Madame, je fais ce que je peux
Même si j'me saoule à l'hydromel
Pour mieux parler d'virilité
A des mémères décorées
Comme des arbres de Noël
Je sais qu'dans ma soûlographie
Chaque nuit pour des éléphants roses

Cerclé de femmes languissantes
Même si lassé d'être chanteur
J'y sois devenu maître chanteur
Et qu'ce soit les autres qui chantent
Même si on m'appelle le beau Serge
Que je vende des bateaux d'opium
Du whisky de Clermont-Ferrand
De vrais pédés, de fausses vierges
Que j'aie une banque à chaque doigt
Et un doigt dans chaque pays
Et que chaque pays soit à moi
Je sais quand même que chaque nuit
Tout seul au fond de ma fumerie
Pour un public de vieux Chinois
Je rechanterai ma chanson à moi

Être une heure, une heure quelquefois
Être une heure, rien qu'une heure durant

Chanteur pour femmes à ailes blanches
Que je leur chante ""Alléluia!""

Où c'est pas tous les jours dimanche
Même si on m'appelle Dieu le Père
Celui qui est dans l'annuaire
Entre ""Dieulefit"" et ""Dieu vous garde""

Même si toujours trop bonne pomme
Je m'crève le cœur et l'pur esprit
A vouloir consoler les hommes

J'entendrai dans mon paradis
Les anges, les Saints et Lucifer
Me chanter la chanson d'naguère

Jacques Brel,"Se tiennent par la main
Et marchent en silence
Dans ces villes éteintes
Que le crachin balance

Ne sonnent que leurs pas
Pas à pas fredonnés
Ils marchent en silence
Les désespérés

Ils ont brûlé leurs ailes
Ils ont perdu leurs branches
Tellement naufragés
Que la mort paraît blanche

Ils reviennent d'amour
Ils se sont réveillés
Ils marchent en silence
Les désespérés

Et je sais leur chemin
Pour l'avoir cheminé
Déjà plus de cent fois
Cent fois plus qu'à moitié

Moins vieux ou plus meurtris
Ils vont le terminer
Ils marchent en silence
Les désespérés

Lente sous le pont
L'eau est douce et profonde
Voici la bonne hôtesse
Voici la fin du monde

Ils pleurent leurs prénoms
Comme de jeunes mariés
Et fondent en silence
Les désespérés

Que se lève celui
Qui leur lance la pierre
Ils ne sait de l'amour
Que le verbe s'aimer

Sur le pont n'est plus rien
Qu'une brume légère
Ça s'oublie en silence
Ceux qui ont espéré

Au suivant, au suivant
J'avais juste vingt ans et je me déniaisais
Au bordel ambulant d'une armée en campagne
Au suivant, au suivant

Moi j'aurais bien aimé un peu plus de tendresse
Ou alors un sourire ou bien avoir le temps
Mais au suivant, au suivant
Ce n'fut pas Waterloo mais ce n'fut pas Arcole
Ce fut l'heure où l'on regrette d'avoir manqué l'école

C'est des coups à vous faire des armées d'impuissants
Au suivant, au suivant

Je jure sur la tête de ma première vérole
Que cette voix depuis je l'entends tout le temps
Au suivant, au suivant
Cette voix qui sentait l'ail et le mauvais alcool
C'est la voix des nations et c'est la voix du sang
Au suivant, au suivant
Et depuis chaque femme à l'heure de succomber
Entre mes bras trop maigres semble me murmurer
""Au suivant, au suivant""

Tous les suivants du monde devraient s'donner la main
Voilà ce que la nuit je crie dans mon délire
Au suivant, au suivant
Et quand je n'délire pas, j'en arrive à me dire
Qu'il est plus humiliant d'être suivi que suivant

Est-ce qu'il est encore chaud?
Est-ce qu'il est déjà froid?""

Qui ne me connaissaient plus
Z'ont amené des enfants

Et trouvent indécent
De ne pas mourir au printemps

Tous mes chers faux amis
Souriant sous le poids
Du devoir accompli
Ah, je te vois déjà
Trop triste, trop à l'aise
Protégeant sous le drap
Tes larmes lyonnaises
Tu ne sais même pas
Sortant de mon cimetière
Que tu entres en ton enfer
Quand s'accroche à ton bras
Le bras de ton quelconque
Le bras de ton dernier
Qui te fera pleurer
Bien autrement que moi

Ah, je me vois déjà
M'installant à jamais
Bien au triste, bien au froid
Dans mon champ d'osselets
Ah, je me vois déjà
Je me vois tout au bout
De ce voyage-là
D'où l'on revient de tout
Je vois déjà tout ça
Et l'on a le brave culot
D'oser me demander
De n'plus boire que de l'eau
De n'plus trousser les filles
De mettre d'l'argent d'côté
D'aimer l'filet d'maquereau

Au fond de mon miroir.",L' Air de la Betise,1998
Jacques Brel,"Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui chantent
Les rêves qui les hantent
Au large d’Amsterdam
Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui dorment
Comme des oriflammes
Le long des berges mornes
Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui meurent
Pleins de bière et de drames
Aux premières lueurs
Mais dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui naissent
Dans la chaleur épaisse
Des langueurs océanes

Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui mangent
Sur des nappes trop blanches
Des poissons ruisselants
Ils vous montrent des dents
A croquer la fortune
A décroiser la lune
A bouffer des haubans
Et ça sent la morue
Jusque dans le cœur des frites
Que leurs grosses mains invitent
A revenir en plus
Puis se lèvent en riant
Dans un bruit de tempête
Referment leur braguette
Et sortent en rotant

Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui dansent
En se frottant la panse
Sur la panse des femmes
Et ils tournent et ils dansent
Comme des soleils crachés
Dans le son déchiré
D’un accordéon rance
Ils se tordent le cou
Pour mieux s’entendre rire
Jusqu’à ce que tout à coup
L’accordéon expire
Alors le geste grave
Alors le regard fier
Ils ramènent leur batave
Jusqu’en pleine lumière

Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui boivent
Et qui boivent et reboivent
Et qui reboivent encore
Ils boivent à la santé
Des putains d’Amsterdam
De Hambourg ou d’ailleurs
Enfin ils boivent aux dames
Qui leur donnent leur joli corps
Qui leur donnent leur vertu
Pour une pièce en or
Et quand ils ont bien bu
Se plantent le nez au ciel
Se mouchent dans les étoiles
Et ils pissent comme je pleure
Sur les femmes infidèles
Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Dans le port d’Amsterdam.",Amsterdam,1998
Jacques Brel,"Donne-moi la main
Le soleil a paru
Il nous faut prendre le chemin
Le temps des moissons est venu

Le blé nous a tant attendu
Et nous attendons trop de pain
Ta main sur mon bras
Pleine de douceur

Bien gentiment demandera
De vouloir épargner les fleurs
Ma faucille les évitera
Pour éviter que tu ne pleures

Les blés sont pour la faucille
Les soleils pour l'horizon
Les garçons sont pour les filles
Et les filles pour les garçons

Les blés sont pour la faucille
Les soleils pour l'horizon
Les garçons sont pour les filles
Et les filles pour les garçons

Donne-moi tes yeux
Le soleil est chaud
Et dans ton regard lumineux
Il a fait jaillir des jets d'eau

Qui mieux qu'un geste
Mieux qu'un mot
Rafraichiront ton amoureux
Penchée vers le sol, tu gerbes le blé

Et si parfois ton jupon vole
Pardonne-moide regarder
Les trésors que vient dévoiler
Pour mon plaisir le vent frivole

Les blés sont pour la faucille
Les soleils pour l'horizon
Les garçons sont pour les filles
Et les filles pour les garçons

Les blés sont pour la faucille
Les soleils pour l'horizon
Les garçons sont pour les filles
Et les filles pour les garçons

Donne-moi ton cœur
Le soleil fatigué
S'en est allé
Chanter ailleurs

La chanson des blés moisonnés
Venu est le tempsde s'aimer
Il nous faut glaner le bonheur
Ecrasés d'amour éblouis de joie

Je saluerai la fin du jour
En te serrant tout contre moi
Et tu combleras mon émoi
En me disant que pour toujours

Les blés sont pour la faucille
Les soleils pour l'horizon
Les garçons sont pour les filles
Et les filles pour les garçons

Les blés sont pour la faucille
Les soleils pour l'horizon
Les garçons sont pour les filles
Et les filles pour les garçons

J'en appelle aux amours que chantent les rivières
A l'éclatement bleu des matins de printemps
A la force jolie des filles qui ont vingt ans
A la fraîcheur certaine d'un vieux puits de désert
A l'étoile qu'attend le vieil homme qui se perd
Pour que monte de nous et plus fort qu'un désir
Le désir incroyable de se vouloir construire
En se désirant faible et plutôt qu'orgueilleux
En se désirant lâche plutôt que monstrueux

J'en appelle à ton rire que tu croques au soleil
J'en appelle à ton cri à nul autre pareil
Au silence joyeux qui parle doucement
A ces mots que l'on dit rien qu'en se regardant
A la pesante main de notre amour sincère
A nos vingt ans trouvés à tout ce qu'ils espèrent
Pour que monte de nous et plus fort qu'un désir
Le désir incroyable de se vouloir construire
En préférant plutôt que la gloire inutile
Et le bonheur profond et puis la joie tranquille

J'en appelle aux maisons écrasées de lumière
J'en appelle à ton cri à nul autre pareil",J'En Appelle,1998
Jacques Brel,"Derrière la saleté
S'étalant devant nous
Derrière les yeux plissés
Et les visages mous
Au-delà de ces mains
Ouvertes ou fermées
Qui se tendent en vain
Ou qui sont poing levé
Plus loin que les frontières
Qui sont de barbelés
Plus loin que la misère
Il nous faut regarder

Il nous faut regarder
Ce qu'il y a de beau
Le ciel gris ou bleuté
Les filles au bord de l'eau

L'ami qu'on sait fidèle
Le soleil de demain
Le vol d'une hirondelle
Le bateau qui revient

Par-delà le concert
Des sanglots et des pleurs
Et des cris de colère
Des hommes qui ont peur
Par-delà le vacarme
Des rues et des chantiers
Des sirènes d'alarme
Des jurons de charretier
Plus fort que les enfants
Qui racontent les guerres
Et plus fort que les grands
Qui nous les ont fait faire

Il nous faut écouter
L'oiseau au fond des bois
Le murmure de l'été
Le sang qui monte en soi

Les prières des enfants
Et le bruit de la terre
Qui s'endort doucement",Il  Nous Faut Regarder,1998
Jacques Brel,"Pardon pour cette fille
Que l'on a fait pleurer
Pardon pour ce regard
Que l'on quitte en riant
Pardon pour ce visage
Qu'une larme a changé
Pardon pour ces maisons
Où quelqu'un nous attend
Et puis pour tous ces mots
Que l'on dit mots d'amour
Et que nous employons
En guise de monnaie
Et pour tous les serments
Qui meurent au petit jour
Pardon pour les jamais
Pardon pour les toujours

Pardon de ne plus voir
Les choses comme elles sont
Pardon d'avoir voulu
Oublier nos vingt ans
Pardon d'avoir laissé
S'oublier nos leçons
Pardon de renoncer
A nos renoncements
Et puis de se terrer
Au milieu de sa vie
Et puis de préférer
Le salaire de Judas
Pardon pour l'amitié
Pardon pour les amis

Pardon pour les hameaux
Qui ne chantent jamais
Pardon pour les villages
Que l'on a oubliés
Pardon pour les cités

Pardon pour les pays
Faits de sous-officiers
Pardon d'être de ceux

Et de ne pas avoir
Chaque jour essayé
Et puis pardon encore
Et puis pardon surtout
De ne jamais savoir
Qui doit nous pardonner",Pardons,1998

Jacques Brel,"N'est-il pas vrai Marie que c'est prier pour vous
Que de lui dire «Je t'aime» en tombant à genoux?
N'est-il pas vrai Marie que c'est prier pour vous
Que pleurer de bonheur en riant comme un fou
Que couvrir de tendresse nos païennes amours
C'est fleurir de prières chaque nuit, chaque jour?

N'est-il pas vrai Marie que c'est chanter pour vous
Que semer nos chemins, de simple poésie?
N'est-il pas vrai Marie que c'est chanter pour vous
Que voir en chaque chose, une chose jolie

Jacques Brel,"Qu'avons-nous fait bonnes gens, dites-moi,
De la bonté du monde?
On l'aurait cachée au fond d'un bois
Que ça ne m'étonnerait guère
On l'aurait enfouie dix pieds sous terre
Que ça ne m'étonnerait pas
Et c'est dommage de ne plus voir
A chaque soir, chaque matin
Sur les routes, sur les trottoirs
Une foule de petits Saint-Martin

Qu'avons-nous fait bonnes gens, dites-moi,
De tout l'amour du monde?
On l'aurait vendu pour je ne sais quoi
Que ça ne m'étonnerait guère
On l'aurait vendu pour faire la guerre
Que ça ne m'étonnerait pas

Les amoureux qui ont vingt ans

Ne brûlent plus les feux de la Saint-Jean

Toutes ces joies profondes
On les retrouverait au fond de soi

Jacques Brel,"Tu n'as rien compris

S'il te faut des trains pour fuir vers l'aventure
Et de blancs navires qui puissent t'emmener
Chercher le soleil à mettre dans tes yeux
Chercher des chansons que tu puisses chanter
Alors

S'il te faut l'aurore pour croire au lendemain
Et des lendemains pour pouvoir espérer
Retrouver l'espoir qui t'a glissé des mains
Retrouver la main que ta main a quittée
Alors

S'il te faut des mots prononcés par des vieux
Pour te justifier tous tes renoncements
Si la poésie pour toi n'est plus qu'un jeu
Si toute ta vie n'est qu'un vieillissement
Alors

S'il te faut l'ennui pour te sembler profond
Et le bruit des villes pour saouler tes remords
Et puis, des faiblesses pour te paraître bon
Et puis, des colères pour te paraître fort
Alors

Alors, tu n'as rien compris",S'il Te Faut,1998
Jacques Brel,"Il y a longtemps de cela
Au fond du ciel, le bon saint Pierre
Comme un collégien se troubla
Pour une étoile au cœur de pierre
Sitôt conquise, elle s'envole
En embrasant de son regard
Le cœur, la barbe et l'auréole
Du bon saint Pierre au désespoir
Qui criait et pleurait
Dans les rues du paradis
Qui criait et pleurait
Tout en se moquant de lui

Effeuillons l'aile d'un ange
Pour voir si elle pense à moi
Effeuillons l'aile d'un ange
Pour voir si elle m'aimera

Saint Pierre alors partit chercher
A cheval sur un beau nuage
Vainement dans la Voie Lactée
Sa jeune étoile au cœur volage
Au paradis, lorsqu'il revint
Devant la porte, il est resté
N'osant montrer tout son chagrin
A ses copains auréolés
Qui criaient et pleuraient
Dans les rues du paradis
Qui criaient et pleuraient
Tout en se moquant de lui

Effeuillons l'aile d'un ange
Pour voir si elle pense à toi
Effeuillons l'aile d'un ange
Pour voir si elle t'aimera

Mais le bon Dieu lui vint en aide
Car les barbus sont syndiqués
Il changea l'étoile en planète
Et fit de saint Pierre un portier
Et de ces anges déplumés
Par les amours du bon saint Pierre
Afin de tout récupérer
Il fit les démons de l'enfer
Ceux qui crient, ceux qui pleurent
A l'heure où naissent les nuits
Ceux qui crient, ceux qui pleurent
Dans un coin de votre esprit

Effeuillons l'aile d'un ange
Pour voir si elle pense à moi
Effeuillons l'aile d'un ange
Pour voir si elle m'aimera",Saint Pierre,1998
Jacques Brel,"Sur la place chauffée au soleil
Une fille s'est mise à danser
Elle tourne toujours, pareille
Aux danseuses d'antiquités,
Sur la ville il fait trop chaud
Hommes et femmes sont assoupis
Et regardent par le carreau
Cette fille qui danse à midi

Ainsi certains jours, paraît
Une flamme à nos yeux
A l'église où j'allais
On l'appelait le bon Dieu
L'amoureux l'appelle l'amour
Le mendiant la charité
Le soleil l'appelle le jour
Et le brave homme la bonté

Sur la place vibrante d'air chaud
Où pas même ne paraît un chien
Ondulante comme un roseau
La fille bondit, s'en va, s'en vient
Ni guitare ni tambourin
Pour accompagner sa danse
Elle frappe dans ses mains
Pour se donner la cadence

Ainsi certains jours, paraît
Une flamme à nos yeux
A l'église où j'allais
On l'appelait le bon Dieu
L'amoureux l'appelle l'amour
Le mendiant la charité
Le soleil l'appelle le jour
Et le brave homme la bonté

Sur la place où tout est tranquille
Une fille s'est mise à chanter
Et son chant plane sur la ville
Hymne d'amour et de bonté
Mais sur la ville il fait trop chaud
Et, pour ne point entendre son chant,
Les hommes ferment les carreaux
Comme une porte entre morts et vivants

Ainsi certains jours, paraît
Une flamme en nos cœurs
Mais nous ne voulons jamais
Laisser luire sa lueur
Nous nous bouchons les oreilles
Et nous nous voilons les yeux
Nous n'aimons point les réveils
De notre cœur déjà vieux

Sur la place, un chien hurle encore
Car la fille s'en est allée
Et comme le chien hurlant la mort
Pleurent les hommes leur destinée",Sur la Place,1998
Jacques Brel,"Les vieux ne parlent plus 
Ou alors seulement 
Parfois du bout des yeux,
Même riches ils sont pauvres, 
Ils n'ont plus d'illusions, 
Et n'ont qu'un cœur pour deux.
Chez eux ça sent le thym, 
Le propre, la lavande, 
Et le verbe d'antan,
Que l'on vive à Paris, 
On vit tous en province 
Quand on vit trop longtemps.
Est-ce d'avoir trop ri 
Que leur voix se lézarde 
Quand ils parlent d'hier?
Et d'avoir trop pleuré 
Que des larmes encore 
Leur perlent les paupières?
Et s'ils tremblent un peu 
Est-ce de voir vieillir 
La pendule d'argent
Qui ronronne au salon, 
Qui dit oui, qui dit non, 
Qui dit ""Je vous attends"".

Les vieux ne rêvent plus, 
Leurs livres s'ensommeillent, 
Leurs pianos sont fermés,
Le petit chat est mort. 
Le muscat du dimanche 
Ne les fait plus chanter,
Les vieux ne bougent plus, 
Leurs gestes ont trop de rides, 
Leur monde est trop petit,
Du lit à la fenêtre, 
Puis du lit au fauteuil, 
Et puis du lit au lit,
Et s'ils sortent encore 
Bras dessus, bras dessous, 
Tout habillés de raide,
C'est pour suivre au soleil 
L'enterrement d'un plus vieux, 
L'enterrement d'une plus laide,
Et le temps d'un sanglot 
Oublier toute une heure 
La pendule d'argent
Qui ronronne au salon, 
Qui dit oui, qui dit non, 
Et puis qui les attend.

Les vieux ne meurent pas, 
Ils s'endorment un jour 
Et dorment trop longtemps,
Ils se tiennent la main, 
Ils ont peur de se perdre, 
Et se perdent pourtant
Et l'autre reste là, 
Le meilleur ou le pire, 
Le doux ou le sévère,
Cela n'importe pas, 
Celui des deux qui reste 
Se retrouve en enfer.
Vous le verrez peut-être, 
Vous le verrez parfois 
En pluie et en chagrin
Traverser le présent. 
En s'excusant déjà 
De n'être pas plus loin.
Et fuir devant vous 
Une dernière fois 
La pendule d'argent
Qui ronronne au salon, 
Qui dit oui, qui dit non, 
Qui leur dit ""Je t'attends"",
Qui ronronne au salon, 
Qui dit oui, qui dit non, 
Et puis qui nous attend",Les Vieux,1998
Jacques Brel,"Voir la rivière gelée 
Vouloir être un printemps 
Voir la terre brûlée 
Et semer en chantant 
Voir que l'on a vingt ans 
Vouloir les consumer
Voir passer un croquant
Et tenter de l'aimer
Voir une barricade
Et la vouloir défendre
Voir périr l'embuscade
Et puis ne pas se rendre
Voir le gris des faubourgs
Vouloir être Renoir
Voir l'ennemi de toujours
Et fermer sa mémoire

Voir que l'on va vieillir
Et vouloir commencer
Voir un amour fleurir
Et s'y vouloir brûler
Voir la peur inutile
La laisser aux crapauds
Voir que l'on est fragile
Et chanter à nouveau
Voilà ce que je vois
Voilà ce que je veux
Depuis que je te vois
Depuis que je te veux",Voir,1998

Toe vergeet de nijd

Met een snijdend woord
Ons geluk vermoord

Lief, ik zoek voor jou
In 't stof van de wegen

De paarlen van dauw
Ik zal al mijn leven
Werken zonder rust

Goud en goed te geven
Ik sticht een gebied
Waar de liefde troont
Waar de liefde loont
Waar jouw wil geschiedt
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen

Laat me niet alleen
Ik bedenk voor jou
Woorden rood en blauw
Taal voor jou alleen
En met warme mond
Zeggen wij elkaar
Eens was er een paar
Dat zichzelf weer vond
Ook vertel ik jou
Van de koning die
Stierf van nostalgie
Hunkerend naar jou
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen

Want uit een vulkaan
Die was uitgeblust
Breekt zich na wat rust
Toch het vuur weer baan
En op oude grond
Ziet men vaak het graan
Heel wat hoger staan
Dan op verse grond
Het wit mint het zwart
Zwakheid mint de kracht
Daglicht mint de nacht
Mijn hart mint jouw hart
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen

Laat me niet alleen
Nee ik huil niet meer
Nee ik spreek niet meer
Want ik wil alleen
Horen hoe je praat
Kijken hoe je lacht
Weten hoe je zacht
Door de kamer gaat
Nee ik vraag niet meer

'K Wil je voetstap zijn

Jacques Brel,"Men vergeet niets, neen niets
Men vergeet niemendal
Men vergeet niets of niets
Men past zich aan, c'est tout

Nooit een vaarwel aan land en thuis
Geen enkele reis ver weg van huis
Van vergezicht tot vergezicht
Van aangezicht tot aangezicht

Geen enkele kroeg waar men zijn pijn
In drank verdrinkt om vrij te zijn
Van al dat heimwee in het hart
En alles wat de geest verwacht

Want niemand of niets ter wereld
Is er die je vergeten doet
Wat er diep in het hart gegrond zit
Da's zo waar als de wereld rond is

Men vergeet niets, neen niets
Men vergeet niemendal
Men vergeet niets of niets
Men past zich aan, c'est tout

Geen 'k hou van jou, geen voor altijd
Geen woord van trouw, geen woord van spijt
Wat ons vervolgt waar wij ook gaan
Zijn stempel drukt op ons bestaan

Geen liefde die één enkele nacht
Wat licht en hoop in 't leven bracht
Maar die in de vroege morgen uren
Een waan bleek en van korte duur

Want niemand ook of niets ter wereld
Is er die je vergeten doet
Wat er diep in het hart gegrond zit
Da's zo waar als de wereld rond is

Men vergeet niets, neen niets
Men vergeet niemendal
Men vergeet niets of niets
Men past zich aan, c'est tout

Ook niet de tijd dat het verdriet
Mij duizend rijmen schrijven liet
Zelfs niet de tijd die ons vervreemdt
En rimpels voor een glimlach neemt

En 't grote bed ook zeker niet
Dat éénmaal rust en vrede biedt
En dat ook mij op zekere dag
Met wijd gebaar ontvangen mag

Want niemand ook of niets ter wereld
Is er die je vergeten doet
Wat er diep in het hart gegrond zit
Da's zo waar als de wereld rond is

Men vergeet niets, neen niets
Men vergeet niemendal
Men vergeet niets of niets

Jacques Brel,"Ce qu'il nous faut, mais c'est de l'amour
L'amour qui vient embraser nos coeurs
Ce qu'il nous faut, c'est un peu d'bonnheur
Afin d'pouvoir conserver nos amours
Ce qu'il nous faut, il nous faut rêver
Aller joyeux vers les lendemains
Ce qu'il nous faut, c'est prendre une main
Afin qu'à nous deux nous puissions rêver

Vous jeunesse folle
Qui jouez aux jeux de l'ennui
Passé est le temps de l'école
Écoutez donc ma philosophie

Ce qu'il nous faut ce sont des chansons
Que le matin mettra sur vos lèvres
Ce qu'il nous faut quand le jour se lève
C'est que nos lèvres aient déjà leur chanson
Ce qu'il nous faut, mais ce sont les rues
Pleines de cris, de rires d'enfants
Ce qu'il nous faut c'est un bout d'printemps
Dont on ira pavoiser les rues

Vous gens raisonnables
Que la raison a fatigués
Fatiguez-vous à être aimables
Et laissez-moi vous expliquer

Ce qu'il vous faut mais c'est être fou
Fou de la vie fou, de ses chemins
Ce qu'il vous faut, ne penser à rien
Afin de pouvoir, jour et nuit, rester fou
Ce qu'il vous faut ce sont des maisons
Faites de joie, faites de soleil
Ce qu'il nous faut, ce sont des merveilles
Que l'on mettra dans toutes les maisons

A vous Mademoiselle
Si vos yeux bleus deviennent gris
Et s'ils ne voient plus d'hirondelles
C'est qu'on ne vous a jamais dit

Ce qu'il nous faut mais c'est de l'amour
L'amour qui vient embraser les coeurs
Ce qu'il nous faut c'est un peu de bonheur

Jacques Brel,"Parlez-moi de la pluie et non pas du beau temps
Le beau temps me dégoute et m'fait grincer les dents
Le bel azur me met en rage
Car le plus grand amour qui m'fut donné sur terr'
Je l'dois au mauvais temps, je l'dois à Jupiter
Il me tomba d'un ciel d'orage

Par un soir de novembre, à cheval sur les toits
Un vrai tonnerr' de Brest, avec des cris d'putois
Allumait ses feux d'artifice
Bondissant de sa couche en costume de nuit
Ma voisine affolée vint cogner à mon huis
En réclamant mes bons offices

"" Je suis seule et j'ai peur, ouvrez-moi, par pitié
Mon époux vient d'partir faire son dur métier
Pauvre malheureux mercenaire
Contraint d'coucher dehors quand il fait mauvais temps
Pour la bonne raison qu'il est représentant
D'un' maison de paratonnerres ""

En bénissant le nom de Benjamin Franklin
Je l'ai mise en lieu sûr entre mes bras câlins
Et puis l'amour a fait le reste
Toi qui sèmes des paratonnerr's à foison
Que n'en as-tu planté sur ta propre maison
Erreur on ne peut plus funeste

Quand Jupiter alla se faire entendre ailleurs
La belle, ayant enfin conjuré sa frayeur
Et recouvré tout son courage
Rentra dans ses foyers fair' sécher son mari
En m'donnant rendez-vous les jours d'intempérie
Rendez-vous au prochain orage

A partir de ce jour j'n'ai plus baissé les yeux
J'ai consacré mon temps à contempler les cieux
A regarder passer les nues
A guetter les stratus, à lorgner les nimbus
A faire les yeux doux aux moindres cumulus
Mais elle n'est pas revenue

Son bonhomm' de mari avait tant fait d'affair's
Tant vendu ce soir-là de petits bouts de fer
Qu'il était dev'nu millionnaire
Et l'avait emmenée vers des cieux toujours bleus
Des pays imbécil's où jamais il ne pleut
Où l'on ne sait rien du tonnerre

Dieu fass' que ma complainte aille, tambour battant
Lui parler de la pluie, lui parler du gros temps
Auxquels on a t'nu tête ensemble
Lui conter qu'un certain coup de foudre assassin
Dans le mill' de mon cœur a laissé le dessin
D'un' petit' fleur qui lui ressemble",L' Orage (Le Ciel),2003
Jacques Brel,"Le cœur bien au chaud, les yeux dans la bière
Chez la grosse Adrienne de Montalant
Avec l'ami Jojo, et avec l'ami Pierre
On allait boire nos vingt ans

Jojo se prenait pour Voltaire
Et Pierre pour Casanova
Et moi, moi qui étais le plus fier
Moi, moi je me prenais pour moi

Et quand vers minuit passaient les notaires
Qui sortaient de l'hôtel des, ""Trois Faisans""

Je te raconterai l'histoire de ce roi mort
De n'avoir pas pu te rencontrer

Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas

On a vu souvent 
Rejaillir le feu 
D'un ancien volcan

Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 

Ne me quitte pas 
Je ne vais plus pleurer 
Je ne vais plus parler 
Je me cacherai là

À t'écouter chanter et puis rire

Jacques Brel,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Yes, if I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando...",Fernand,2006

Ils s'aiment s'aiment pour toujours

Quand se retrouvent en courant

Ils s'aiment s'aiment à la folie
S'effeuillant à l'ombre des feux
Se découvrant comme deux fruits
Puis se trouvant n'être plus deux
Se dénouant comme velours
Se reprenant au petit jour
Et s'endormant les plus heureux
Les amants,les amants de coeur
Les amants

Ils s'aiment s'aiment en tremblant

Chaque seconde est une peur
Qui croque le coeur entre ses dents

Où n'vinrent que des facteurs
Pour n'avoir pas peur du loup
Les amants,les amants de coeur
Les amants

Ils s'aiment s'aiment en pleurant
Chaque jour un peu moins amants
Quand ils ont bu tout leur mystère
Deviennent comme soeur et frère
Brûlent leurs ailes d'inquiétude
Redeviennent deux habitudes
Alors changent de partenaire

Qui s'aiment s'aiment en riant
Qui s'aiment s'aiment pour toujours
Qui s'aiment tout au long du jour

Oh, you can kiss me on a cool day, a hot day
A wet day, which everyone you choose
Or try to kiss me on a gray day, a May day
A pay day, and see if I refuse
And if you make it on a bleak day
A freak day, a week day, why you can be my guest
But never, never on a Sunday",Ta Pedia Tou Pirea,2006
Jacques Denjean,"Mes yeux sont fous
Ou mes yeux sont fous
Ou là, devant moi
C'est la fille que j'aime

Et, dans ses bras, c'est mon meilleur ami
Mais non, je ne peux croire ça

Ça me ferait trop mal
Elle ne ferait pas ça
Ça me ferait trop mal
Elle ne dirait pas ça, pas ça

Mon amour, mon amour, mon amour
Ou mes yeux sont fous
Ou la vie me joue un tour
Mais pourquoi me faire ça

Je veux si peu
Je demandais qu'elle m'aime un peu
Mais c'était beaucoup
Leurs lèvres qui se cherchent

Ça me ferait trop mal
Et ces mots qu'elle lui crie
Ça me ferait trop mal, trop mal
Mon amour, mon amour, mon amour

Cet ami qui trahit
Ça me ferait trop mal
Cette fille qui m'oublie
Ça me ferait trop mal

Mes yeux se sont trompés
Mes yeux sont fous
Oh, non ce n'est pas vrai
Ce n'est pas vrai

Jacques Diéval,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Jacques Diéval,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2003
Jacques Diéval,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad

Jacques Dutronc,"J'aime les fleurs et la fumée,
Je ne suis plus un révolté
Les beatniks c'est dépassé,
Maintenant le monde, il faut l'aimer

Je suis hippie, je suis hippie,
C'est ma nouvelle philosophie

Vive le Moukroutrah

Ceux qui me cassent la figure,
Ceux qui me marchent sur les pieds
Ceux qui me cognent en voiture,
Ceux qui me cognent sur le nez

Papa, maman, toute la famille,
L'église, l'armée et la patrie
Je les aime,
Je les aime,

Je les aime...

Je suis hippie, je suis hippie,
C'est ma nouvelle philosophie
Hip, hip, hourrah!
Vive le Moukroutrah

Je me suis tatoué des fleurs,
Sur la poitrine, et puis ailleurs
J'ai loué une place sur un bateau,
Qui partait pour San Francisco

Je suis hippie, je suis hippie,
Ce est ma nouvelle philosophie

ca n'a aucune importance

Quand je lance mes boules puantes

Quand je souffle dans ma trompette 
Je fais s'évanouir la préfète

Avec mon cou avec mes reins

Et que je danse en calecon

Jacques Dutronc,"Refrain :
Un jour, tu verras, on se rencontrera,
Quelque part, n'importe où, guidés par le hasard,
Nous nous regarderons et nous nous sourirons,
Et , la main dans la main, par les rues nous irons.
Le temps passe si vite, le soir cachera bien nos coeurs,
Ces deux voleurs qui gardent leur bonheur ;
Puis nous arriverons sur une place grise
Où les pavés seront doux à nos âmes grises.
Il y aura un bal, très pauvre et très banal,
Sous un ciel plein de brume et de mélancolie.
Un aveugle jouera de l'orgu' de Barbarie
Cet air sera pour nous le plu beau, l'plus joli !

Moi, je t'inviterai, la taille, je prendrai
Nous danserons tranquill' loin des gens de la ville,
Nous danserons l'amour, les yeux au fond des yeux
Vers une nuit profonde, vers une fin du monde.

Ah je manque d'originalité, c'est vrai
Savez-vous que nous nous séparons pour la première fois?
Oui mais enfin c'est pas très long et puis il ne part que quinze jours
Attendez un p'tit peu, dois-je comprendre que
Vous allez passer ces quinze horribles jours sans compter les heures?

Puisque nous nous quittons ce soir

Je veux sourire avec courage
Vous avez posé vos bagages
Marche avant, côté du couloir
Et pour les grands signaux d'usage
J'ai préparé mon grand mouchoir
Dans un instant le train démarre
Je resterai seul sur le quai
Et vous me verrez dans la gare
Me dire adieu là-bas avec votre bouquet
Promettez-moi d'être bien sage
De penser à moi tous les jours
Et retourner dans notre cage
Pour mieux attendre mon retour

Hé bien voilà, vous avez une place tout à fait tranquille
Sans voisine, sans vis-à-vis, personne pour vous déranger
Il espère que c'est non-fumeurs 
Décidément, vous êtes incorrigibles
Et moi qui pensais qu'un peu d'isolement vous aiderait à vous détendre
Et puis quoi encore? Ah lala

Puisque vous partez en voyage
Vous m'avez promis mon chéri
De vous écrire quatorze pages
Tous les matins ou davantage
Pour que je voie votre visage
Baissez la vitre je vous prie
C'est affreux je perds tout courage
Et moi je déteste Paris

L'enfoiré, il sait pourtant bien
Que je dois rester, mais je jure
Que s'il le crie encore une fois, moi je viens

She's the most beautiful person in the world (ooh, yeah)

Her smile is so warm and her eyes burn so deep (deep, deep)
Softly in rhymes of love she sings to me
Love is for love but only if it's meant to be (only if it's meant to be, baby)

I'm in love with a plain and simple girl (I'm in love)
She takes my heart and sends me for a whirl
I'm on the wings of love and I don't take care where I go (honey, I'm so in love)
Because when we reach that star we both will know

Some old-fashion love, baby I know that you do it right (do it, do it, do it to it, baby)

I want some lovin' tonight
Some old-fashion love, baby, I know that you do, do, right
Do it, do it, do it right, baby (I know you do it right)

I just love the way she makes love (I love it, I love it)
She gives me all she can as I feel its flow
Oh baby, her love is plain and simple and that's all right with me
Because it's so passionate girl, she makes me see
(Love is for love and this love was meant to be)

Ow, I want some love, baby, ow

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Qui vient de Mexico avec de longs détours
Ce tout petit tacot va comm' un escargot

Dans les côtes, il s'allonge
Comme un vieux bandonéon
Sous les palmes qui l'effleurent
Parfois il perd son calme
Et file à trente à l'heure...
Mais bien vite, s'il s'agite
L'chauffeur se précipite
Et il renverse la vapeur

Mais quand le p'tit tacot, qui vient de Mexico
Se trouve tout de go en panne quelque part
Planteurs et hidalgos déposent leur mégot
Et poussent le tacot jusqu'à la prochain' gar'

Venaient s’y batailler

Un comptoir flambant qui fait d’ l’effet

Où le cœur sans espoir 
Je pleurais en attendant

Que tu m'enroules autour du cœur 
Pour l'empêcher de courir
Se faire prendre ailleurs

Et si tout ce que j'adore en toi, dort en moi 
Je veux que tu le réveilles en moi, veille en toi

Des pluies de nos caresses

Loin de Paris, loin de ses frasques

Je m'ennuie, je deviens folle
Qui me délivrera 
De mes fantasmes inassouvis
Mon mari est à la chasse
Mon majordome s'est fait la paire
Je reste seule devant la glace
Goûtant des plaisirs solitaires? Ah !!!
Je t'ai fait peur?
Ne me touche pas, n'oublie pas que je suis ta s?ur !
Ah quelle belle paire de miches
Mais, Bibiche, là n'est pas le propos : 
Ma poulette a claqué toute son artiche 
Et elle m'attend à la roulette au casino
Du fric, toujours du fric !
Tu ne viens jamais me voir que pour me taper
Suis-je donc moins désirable 
Que toutes tes misérables traînées ?
Oh, t'excite pas, c'est pas la question, allez

Montée brûlante de ma sève
Non pas encore, retiens-toi? 
Ah ! j'entends des pas
Dans le couloir
Cache-toi vite dans le placard
Bonsoir ma chérie, dans mes bras !
J'ai ramené ce trophée de ma chasse ah ah ah :
Une tête de vache avec ses cornes 
Je m'en vais de ce pas la ranger dans le placard
Non !
Et pourquoi ?

Tu ferais mieux de t'allonger 
Pendant que je vais la ranger dans le placard

Jacques Higelin,"La nuit promet d'être belle
Car voici qu'au fond du ciel 
Apparaît la lune rousse
Saisi d'une sainte frousse
Tout le commun des mortels 
Croit voir le diable à ses trousses
Valets volages et vulgaires
Ouvrez mon sarcophage
Et vous pages pervers 
Courrez au cimetière
Prévenez de ma part 
Mes amis nécrophages
Que ce soir nous sommes attendus dans les marécages

Voici mon message
Cauchemars, fantômes et squelettes 
Laissez flotter vos idées noires
Près de la mare aux oubliettes 
Tenue du suaire obligatoire

Lutins, lucioles, feux-follets
Elfes, faunes et farfadets
S'effraient d'mes grands carnassiers
Une muse un peu dodue 
Me dit d'un air entendu
""Vous auriez pu vous raser""
Comme je lui fais remarquer 
Deux, trois pendus attablés
Qui sont venus sans cravate
Haha, il va m'appeler 
Elle me lance un œil hagard 
Et vomit sans crier gare 
Quelques vipères écarlates

Vampires éblouis 
Par de lubriques vestales
Egéries insatiables 
Chevauchant des Walkyries
Infernales appétits de frénésies bacchanales
Qui charment nos âmes envahies par la mélancolie
Envoi
Satyres joufflus, boucs émissaires 
Gargouilles émues, fières gorgones
Laissez ma couronne aux sorcières 
Et mes chimères à la licorne

Soudain les arbres frissonnent 
Car Lucifer en personne
Fait une courte apparition
L'air tellement accablé
Qu'on lui donnerait volontiers 
Le bon Dieu sans confession
S'il ne laissait malicieux 
Courir le bout de sa queue
Devant ses yeux maléfiques 
Et ne se dressait d'un bond
Dans un concert de jurons
Disant d'un ton pathétique
Que les damnés obscènes cyniques et corrompus
Fassent griefs de leur peine à ceux qu'ils ont élus
Car devant tant de problèmes 
Et de malentendus
Les dieux et les diables en sont venus à douter d'eux-mêmes
De dédain suprême

Mais déjà le ciel blanchit 
Esprits je vous remercie
De m'avoir si bien reçu
Cocher lugubre et bossu, déposez-moi au manoir
Et lâchez ce crucifix
Décrochez-moi ces gousses d'ail 
Qui déshonorent mon portail
Et me chercher sans retard
L'ami qui soigne et guérit 
La folie qui m'accompagne
Et jamais ne m'a trahi

Étranger aux vérités premières énoncées par des cons
J'avais touché le fond de la misère 
Et je crie, et je pleure, et je ris au pied d'une fleur des champs
Égaré, insouciant dans l'âme du printemps, cœur battant
Cœur serré par la colère, par l'éphémère beauté de la vie 

Sur la terre, face aux dieux, tête en l'air
Amoureux d'une émotion légère comme un soleil radieux 
Dans le ciel de ma fenêtre ouverte 
Et je danse, et je lance un appel aux archanges de l'amour
Quelle chance un vautour, d'un coup d'aile d'un coup de bec 
Me rend aveugle et sourd à la détresse
À l'éphémère tristesse de la vie 

Sur la terre, face au ciel, tête en l'air, amoureux
Y a des allumettes au fond de tes yeux
Des pianos à queue dans la boîte aux lettres
Des pots de yaourt dans la vinaigrette 
Et des oubliettes au fond de la cour

Pour la première fois dans une glace

T'es tout l'portrait d'ton adversaire
L'?il aiguisé d'une vipère (oua oua)
Et la paupière
Couchée dessus

Comme une panthère à l'affût

Balance-moi donc à bout pourtant
Une rafale de bons sentiments
Sors ton rictus, montre les crocs
Moi j'additionne tes chicots
Il est trop tard 
Il est trop tôt
Il est trop tard, il est trop tôt
pour mordre

Maintenant que je t'ai craché le morceau
Sors de ton ombre et garde-toi
Assez de jouer au plus fort
Pour que toi et moi n'en fassent qu'un
Il faut que l'autre
Reste pour mort
Il faut que l'autre reste pour mort

Qu'on lève sa coupe d'hydromel

Druides et guerriers se prosternent
A la lueur des flambeaux d'Halloween

Dans la foret de Brocéliande

Danser de folles sarabandes

Dana ! je veux dans tes bras
Goûter aux charmes de l'extase

Ce soir
J'aimerais que tu me laisses
Entrevoir
Oh ma déesse

Que sous un ciel de démence la magie de ta science
Nous entraine et nous change
Au royaume des métamorphoses
En amants légendaires qui osent
S'aimer dans l'au-delà

Toi que j'adore
Délivre-moi de mes errances

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Et son p'tit bout d'mégot
Qui l'fait sans arrêt clignoter des carreaux.

Jacques Météhen Orchestra,"C'était un danseur de tango,
Il était mince, il était beau.
Son vrai prénom c'était Julot,
Mais on l'appelait Antonio.
Dans toutes les boîtes de nuit,
Quand les dancings battaient leur plein,
Et smoking et souliers vernis,
Il répétait jusqu'au matin :

Refrain :

Voulez-vous, Madame,
Avec Antonio,
Qui vous le réclame,
Danser un tango ?
Vraiment sur mon âme
De grand hidalgo.
Vous êtes, Madame,
Plus légère qu'un oiseau.
Votre doux parfum me grise
Vos yeux m'ont conquis.
J'ai la sensation exquise
D'être au Paradis.
Mais sur une gamme
Le tango finit.
Vous pouvez Madame
Me glisser cinq ou dix louis. Merci

Un' riche étrangère, un beau jour
Perdit la tête entre ses bras
Et l'emmena, folle d'amour,
Faire un tour sur la Rivièra.
Mais quand il faut au Casino,
D'vant les tables de baccara,
Il choisit celle où l'on joue gros,
Et poliment lui demanda :

Refrain :
Voulez-vous, Madame,
Avec Antonio,
Qui vous le réclame,
Faire un p'tit banco ?
Ca c'est un coup d'veine,
Vous avez gagné
N'prenez pas la peine
Je me charge d'encaisser.
Retournez encor' les cartes
Cett' fois c'est perdu.
Excusez, il faut que j'parte
Je suis attendu.
Demain soir, j'éspère,
Vous revoir ici .
Mais maint'nant, ma chère,
J'vous dis au-r'voir et merci. Merci

Après un mois de ce jeu-là
Quand ell' revint seule à Paris
Son compte en banque était à plat,
C'lui d'Antonio s'était rempli.
Comme entraîneuse ell' s'engagea,
Et dès l'premier soir à minuit,
Un client très chic s'approcha,
Et tout en s'inclinant lui dit :

Refrain :
Voulez-vous, Madame,
Avec Antonio,
Qui vous réclame,
Danser un tango ?
Ce n'est pas un blâme,
Mais je n'comprends pas,
Comment, chèr' Madame,
Vous en êt's arrivée là ?
Vous aviez pour être heureuse,
Bien plus qu'il n'en faut,
Mais vous êtes trop joueuse
C'est un grand défaut !
Vous pouvez me croire
Fait's comm' Antonio
Trouvez une poire 
Et r'tournez au Casino !",Antonio,1997

Qu't'as une belle gueule
Et quand ton rir' m'a croché l'coeur,
Parc' que j'suis v'nue vers toi tout' seule
Sans que tu m'cherches,
Tu fais l'crâneur
Et, sur le boul'vard,
Quand tu t'balades,
Tu march' comm' un bel animal.
Tu r'gardes les femm's.
Ça m'rend malade
Et tu l'sais bien
Qu'ça m'fait du mal
Mais j'te dis rien
Parce que je t'aime.
Souffrir par toi
C'est bon tout d'même.
Tu pourrais m'faire
Plus de mal encore
Que j'dirais rien,
Alors t'es fort.

Parce que t'es grand,
Moi toute petite
Et que tes poings
Ont l'air d'être lourds,
J'dis toujours oui
Et t'en profites
Et j't'obéis.
Tu gagnes toujours.
Ah... t'es pas méchant.
T'es un peu brute.
C'est pas d'ta faute
Si t'es comm' ça,
Et puis moi
J'aime pas les disputes.
J'ai peur des coups,
On s'refait pas.
Alors j'dis rien
Parce que je t'aime
Et qu't'obéir
C'est bon tout d'même.
Puis ça vaut mieux
Car j'aurais tort.
Y a qu'à nous voir,
C'est toi le plus fort.

Mais y a des jours
Où t'es plus l'même.
Quand t'as l'cafard
Ou des ennuis,
Quand t'as besoin d'sentir
Qu'on t'aime
Et ces jours-là,
Tu deviens tout petit.
Alors j'te prends
Sur ma poitrine.
J'écoute ton c?ur
Et c'est très doux.
J'deviens toute grande
Et j'te câline.
J'suis presque heureuse
Et j'oublie tout.
Là, dans mes bras,
T'oses plus rien dire.
T'as sur les lèvres
Un beau sourire
Et, comme un p'tit môme,
Tu t'endors.

Qui ne sort que la nuit a de très gros ennuis

Courent derrière lui,

Qui n'était pas pianiste
Et le regrettait bien.

Alors mélancolique
Et le coeur tout meurtri
Il ramena chez lui
Un piano mécanique
Pour calmer ses ennuis.

Et jouait dans la nuit
Comme une mécanique
Des airs mélancoliques
Qui doublaient ses ennuis.

Car le sommeil le fuit
Boit seul en égoïste

Jacques Schols,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2005
Jacques Schols,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble

""Oh ! non... non... mais

Il est doux, il est tendre, il est fou...

Who had two sons and one daughter dear. 

One told his secrets to no other,
but to his brother this he said,
""I think our servant courts our sister,
I think they have a mind to wed.
I'll put an end to all their courtship,
I'll send him silent to his grave."" 

A day of hunting was prepared,
Where only bush and briars grew.
And there they did this young man murder,
And in the brake his body threw. 

""Now welcome home, my dear young brothers,
Our serving man, is he behind?""
""We've left him where we've been a-hunting,
""We've left him where no man can find."" 

As she lay dreaming on her pillow,
She thought she saw her own true love;
She dreamt she saw him standing by her,
She saw his coat was red with blood. 

""Don't weep for me, my dearest jewel,
Don't weep for me nor care nor pine,
For your two brothers killed me cruel-
In such a place you may me find. 

""Rise up, my love, tomorrow morning,
Go straightway to that brake you know,
For there you'll find my body lying,
Where only bush and briars grow."" 

She went out early in the morning,
And in the garden brake she stood
And there she found her own dear jewel,
All covered o'er in a gore of blood. 

She took a kerchief from her pocket,
And wiped his eyes though he was blind.
""Because he was my own true lover,
My own true love and a friend of mine."" 

Three days and nights she did sit by him,
And her poor heart was filled with woe,
Till cruel hunger crept upon her,
And home she was obliged to go.

Jad Fair,"He was smiling through his own personal hell
Dropped his last dime in a wishing well
But he was hoping to close and then he fell
Now he's Casper the Friendly Ghost

He was always polite to the people who'd tell him
That he was nothing but a lazy bum, but
Goodbye to them he had to go
Now he's Casper the Friendly Ghost

Nobody treated him nice while he was alive
You can't buy no respect like the librarian said, but
Everybody respects the dead, they
Love a friendly ghost

As we were mean to him but he never burned

Seeds of my wildest dreams fertilized in your eyes

That makes me swear you was trained how to take me there
Rarely I seen faith be fared
We got a stroke of grace remember you was countin' me out?

I got a semi-automatic that spits next time if you talk (you talk)

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Why'all niggas is pussy, poonani, (Vagina)
Your (Monologue's) getting tired, now it's time to ride
You're print distrified, you're no longer desired
So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire
I'm on fire, holly dipped in octane
Let east coast bang, let west coast bang
And Rule gonna bring the ghetto gospel
To every hood possible, pushin' through in the sky blue
Back with the gods you now, preferably the 4 pound
Slugs flyin' at the speed of sound
Tryin' to catch the ears of niggas that's runnin' their mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggas to run in your house
I don't really understand what the runnin's about
But we're hunters, we take pride in airin' our prey out
Leavin 'em laid out, dead, in just a sport
Cause we ain't playin' up here in New York

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Nigga I can see the coke in your nose
This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe
And I was just about to find god
But now that Ma$e is back, I think I'd much rather find a menage
And everybody talkin' crazy how they're AK spit
But we know this investigatin', and they ain't spray shit
Not me, I'm the truth homie, got the industry shook like
""Naw nigga, Joe gonna let 'em loose on me""
True Story, I'm bringin' the T back
Even Roy Jones was forced to (Lean Back)
My nigga Dre said grind cook
Now we killin' them Howard niggas, who said I must of found Pun's rhyme book
Got bitches on top of the Phantom
And the pinky got bling, like the ring around Saturn
Cook coke, crack, niggas fiend for that
And you already know the x is where the team be at

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I swear it couldn't be sweeter, Life's a bitch
Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich
It's guaranteed you gonna die, you might get missed
For maybe 2 or 3 hours, 'til they light their spliffs
And that coke will get you a long time
But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken
And you know they say that you deserved it whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold a title, because I'm in the hood like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids, hoppin' out with them old rifles
Just doin' shit for nothin', it's so spiteful
Ha I'm just like you
Word that niggas want to murk you is in the air
A double shot of yak and the purple is in the air
And I'm not cocky, I'm confident
So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment

[Chorus]",New York New York,
Jadakiss,"[Jadakiss]
They must got a death wish
They was on the road to the riches back in the day they got off on the exit
Trill disrespect shit
Whenever a nigga try to fuck up your investment
It's hard to digest it
Young niggas don't want to get punched in they faces
So they keep the burner on, to catch a bunch of cases
These old niggas still think they livin' in the '80s
The shawties they knew since they were babies turn crazy
The bitches still holla at anybody
Lookin' like they have a couple dollars
Fuck suck and swallow
Ain't nobody winnin' but everybody can't lose
Dirts still there funeral home ain't move
Going in coming out gang affiliated
Rather go back before being humiliated
A black cloud over the hood you can't escape it
Dust smokin' niggas walk around in the matrix
Loyalty is thin, tension is thick
Look at a broke nigga's face when you mention a brick
Stick up kids come around, when they sense that you rich
Cans of lizzle get lit, when you get hit with a fifth
Niggas they used to hoop dreamin' is now sellin' the piff
And they still rattin' but you can't tell if you stiff
Especially when the tek spit, fuck around get your head and your neck hit
Lookin' for a death wish, walk

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Talkin' out your mouth
All wreckless to a nigga that you know
That'll let it off
That's a death wish
When your heart stops and your body gets breathless
And help don't come in enough time
That's a death wish
When you see the blood, realize that your chest is hit
And don't know where it came from
That's a death wish
When you know a nigga whole style's on select shit
(young money)when you violate 'em, fwah
That's a death wish

[Lil Wayne]
On that way left shit
Better get right or get left shit
Better hit right or get left, hit
Even if you threw the best pitch
Yes bitch
It's Weezy F. Bitch
I'm the best, bitch
Motherfuck your guest list
I'll be like let's just kill 'em
And get breakfast
Neck slit, next shit expect this
Every time you check this
I'm exit I mean excited to be your death wish
Bitch I wear this G-shit on my heart not my necklace
And I keep the hypno' for the hecklers
And I'm from the mecca of the wreckless
With a record-breaking debt list
The wreckers and neglectors think all that shit won't affect us
I'm high above you above law above average
Niggas snitching putting niggas in the can like a beverage
Damn
I pop out your head fuck up your memories
I'll put a bullet in Nina head and let her reminisce
Yea
You still don't remember shit
You gon' remember this
I'm knockin' niggas down this year
I'm on my timber shit
Big lion growl at you niggas on that simba shit
I be on that fuck yo clique I kill every member shit
Cool as December shit
Bang in any weather shit
And they can buy your bag but the parts sold separate
Yea that's a bad bitch
Like Russian roulette bitch
Weezy be the genie in the bottle here's your death wish

Soon as I chitter chatter you shitter shatter, I'm the kid
Out of Bronx, that'll stomp you to death like it didn't matter
I'm even better than before, iller metaphors
Killers bet it all on Pun, cause one verse, dead em all

[Chorus]
J-J-J-John Blaze
Ja-Ja-ah-John Bla-Blaze
J-Ja-J-Ja, John Blaze
""Johnny Blaze ain't a damn thing changed!""

Aye yo my attitude is subject to change, I mess around
And spit twelve at the driver's side door of your Range
Six hit you, the other six, up in your dame
Mafia style, leave you with your watch and your chains
Take heed that, not only can I flow I can aim
Cause y'all misdemeanor niggas can't stand the reign
Better believe that, whenever I see y'all I'ma test ya
Only cause I know that fagots respect pressure
Hardcore, like shit you get, kicked out the yard for
'Kiss ain't the cops, but I lock niggas up
You could meet me in my cell I soak and sock niggas up
Far as the flow go, you could let your dough show
Put your money on the table, we could battle on cable
Y'all hot dog niggas get Nathans
Fuck around with Jason, that shorty from The Lox, John Blazin'

My son cool out (what) don't beef yo, throw the tool out
Let's run these niggas, kidnap they work, make em move out
Crushed hash, hands is like glass, keep the heat
In the dash, did some dirt for some work, caught a gash
The flicker blocker, wicked sneaker rocker footwear
Strike me out God, stackin' up joints, rack em like Footlocker
This is raw, raw like fuck kid, represent
Here to Crenshaw, hold my words stronger than a Benz stall
Relentless, the anthology consolidated
With the quickness, dress up in the wig and blouse, killer sickness
Lex, imagination large, gold cards
Beat the bogus squad brains that connect put on the Older God
Specialist, iciclist, Woolridge collar
Feelin' the rich, work for every dollar don't snitch, that's why
Broke niggas who got heart God, sign em up
Start the wind up, we John Blazin', Don up in the line up

[Chorus]

It's simple mathematics, you gotta love us
Cause Joey Crack plus gat equals a lotta dead motherfuckers
Just when you thought I was done, I recruited Pun
Terror Squad Enterprise, undisputed Dunn
I'm from the slums where it's worse, bust with guns til it hurts
For fuckin' with my funds on the first
And go to church like a mobster
Discuss your death over shrimp and lobster, with my Cuban partners
Lucas with the cartridge, twenty shot
Run up on any block, disrespect any cop
Used to run many spots, now I own shops
Gortex with the lot, five sixty-four bills a pop
I'm hot, who wanna get burned?
I fire one in your knot and watch your whole fuckin' head turn
You best learn to parlay, I've had a hard day
Fuck around with the Don and get John Blazed

I kick street tales choking niggas like I'm sprewell 
Golden state holding your fate in the palm of my hand 
Blow you away like its part of the plan 
I gotta call it like I see it talk it like I be it 
Walkin my walk thugged out orthopedic 
Cause I'm soon to be up, give me room watch me heat up 
Niggas try to stick me like abdul lerima, follow the leader 
Make me go extra hard, yo nore should I hold back or show the repirtore 
Quit at 16 or throw in extra bars just for the non-believers 
I show them why its so hard to reach us 
I get pussy with my fathers features 
Puff heavenly, see me at 6'1"" weigh a buck 70 
Catch me in spots y'all niggas never be 
Packed in like green bay 
Harlem week to queens day 
Performing acapella, no dj 
98 live, no replays 
Make it seem easy, so tell a friend to tell a friend 
That its them again, nature noreaga, wild gremlins 

Yo, yo, champagne on the rocks 
Pour on the fort knox lazura 
Shark salad with cabbage 
Pork chops and applesauce 
Twin connection, disrespect watch your body cave in 
Pump the shotty guagin, hit the shorty while he potty training 
I ain't playing, I'm truly the worst 
Simply the first to get his whole body fully reversed 
Uzi it hurts, leave you double-dead 
I'ma a bubble-head, I never listen to nothing my mother said 
Ay yo I hold niggas ransom for money 
Like Johnny handsome 
Been sonning niggas for so long 
I think I got a grandson 
My passion is money, a stash and a honey 
That won't ask questions but will blast anybody 
That's my kind of girl, kinda of world I want to live in 
Not a cell or a prison or in hell's armageddon 
Just a little ghetto 
Where my niggas control the middle 
We know the riddles of life where others know only a little 

Yo, yo been in rich places, sick places 
Seen my story on six thousand six hundred and sixty six pages 
Wages, I wrote six aces 
And at the same dice games, I caught six cases 
All over big faces, now it's tipped laces 
Ready to dig faces, but the bang it ain't 
Bitch spaces, niggas loading up they rib cages 
Cats like to rip places 
Bloody lip tastes, but the Cam is in big races? 
But I stay in import the pig places 
But the world know the girl though 
I fuck her off a furlough 
She'll be up, hook me up 
All your sales could be luck 
Only question for these ducks is 
Baby girl can we fuck 
You the type that need a wife 
Thought L-o-x told y'all the key to life 
Asshole, yo I don't play around 
I lay it down 
Fuck around, I spray around 
Flick a biscuit, nigga risk it 
My ass, you can kick or kiss it 

Ain't no niggas in the world more thorough than this 
(bust off) and sit the hot barrel dead on your lips 
Like 2 thirds of a brick (penaro and kiss) 
And kiss the crystal white fluffy part in the back of a whip 
See the plan is to stash all, and cash y'all 
The weed so strong, they gotta put it glass jars 
Niggas try to smoke me out, mope me out 
'cause the rims on my new joint be poking out 
I'm about to have no feelings 
Shit is deep, do they dance with the devil when they sleep 
I wake up gripping the air, wishing the hit 
Shit that they kick in ya ear 
When your soul be drifting in air 
My gift is half-rotten when I spit it tears 
That shit'll drop down my eye, I'm too tired to cry 
And I ain't never seen a nigga that too live to die 
They say you get what you ask for, so get it 'cause you asked for it 
If a nigga ain't a thief, then he better have the cash for it 
And we gonna be around til ya body rott 
And if the feds bring us in we get the same time gotti got

The other smoke chronic like straight to the brain 
Ay yo lets get loose, Hennesey straight, with tomato juice

Thugged out niggas, we eat as much as we could

Cause these chips, I'ma run em all
Chickenheads, know I, be the Colonel
Cause I burn eternal, mixed wit the inferno

but I'ma hurt you, but you don't know?
My versatile, is a virtue
Ruff Ryders be the team, which means
a lot cream, lot of schemes 
Lot of beams to make your stock drop, right on the seams
Nigga here is too hot and too much for you to touch
Better tell your man cause I'm too tough 
Indubitably, too dust
Do you bust?  Cause we do
You need to ask the people, but quietly
But they don't believe until they leave violently 
Is you buying this?
Cause niggaz that purchased is under the dirt kid
They call me Drag-On; I'm the youngest but get bonkers
Collabo' wit my dogs from Yonkers
but this Bronx bomber's spittin flame
so you better wear your armor
Flame on!

When I pop up, I lock shop up, pull the drop up 
Park a block up, hit the alarm, put the top up
Stash the 'dro in my sock then pull my sock up
And keep the burner but if it's hot put my glock up 
You know what I'm about, slidin off get my cock sucked
Or writin rhymes watching Scarface in the hot tub
Whatchu wanna bet, when I pull it out
if you don't shout that every bullet'll go in and out
Who you know besides 'Kiss take the piss in the bottle of Crist'
and then give it to a modelin bitch 
And you like your watch plain, I'ma flood mine
Alligator bloodline trained to find coke and bite one time

Y'all niggaz ain't hearin me out, til I pop up 
appear in your house, clearin it out, holiday style
Everybody actin violent and wild 
Snatch the wife silence the child, that's how we move
Kill me my man kill you, that's how you lose
I Ruff Ryde, I don't like to slide felt that I slipped
Then the gun's only helpin the clip
And the clip's only helpin my hand
And like who the fuck is helpin your man?
When I cock back and hop out the van 
Double R, get a job, play the shit in the car
Hit a party start a fight at the bar, and snatch your R
Sell your shit for some coke and get the fuck out of Dodge

Guess you figured that my niggaz, flippers, pullin triggers
News team crowd around, tryin to flick a picture
Get witcha, this bitch from Illadelph marches quicker
Nigga not makin sense better stay up off the liquor
Blonde bombshell, car-a-mel, heavy spender 
Groups be sayin I'm they sister, hush ya mouth 'fore I hit ya 
Stickin in wiseguys, fake thugs, and bullshitters
Take you for a ride, cover up your eye, then I get ya 
Used to be shy-er, now I'ma Ruff Ryder

You got a dead niggaz, money don't stop the greed 

That's why now I gotta rock my vest, pop my 3 

And whoever die first, may god forgive 

the nigga who lives, sometimes you gotta handle your biz 

To my niggaz when I die, keep inhalin' the lye 

And come to my wake high, when your tellin' me bye 

What goes around comes around, am I comin' or goin'? 

All i'm tryin' to do is leave you numb, gunnin' or flowin' 

I might cock-back the gauge, and start shootin' at 'cha people 

I'm lookin for the devil 'cause money's the root of evil 

And 'Kiss won't be happy 'til my bezel look see-through 

Until I flood N-why with pediquo and diesle 

Catch me with the top, off my whip 

Bust my gun while it's still tucked so you could hop, off my dick 

I run with a few parolees, all thieves, that rocks ice 

Blue pacholies and rolies 

At the mob meetin', keep quite when the God speakin' 

Squeeze my joint, 'til my mothafuckin' palm squeakin' 

And nevermind who the lox'll sign to (that's right) 

What difference do it make nigga? 

Just listen to the tape nigga (c'mon) 



[Chorus] 



Jay to the mmwwaa, hustle coke, ryde or die (uh) 

Kiss hand-wash money, let it drip dry (uh-huh) 

Jay to the mmwwaa, keep cowards on their toes (yeah) 

Kiss push the drop, rock the ice, get the hoes (uh) 

Jay to the mmwwaa got the smash on the block (uh-huh) 

Kiss got the label's tellin' niggaz not to drop (tell 'em) 

Everthing you get (uh-huh), you really don't expect (naw) 

'cause when you Jay to the mmwwaa, you kiss to the death 



[Verse 2] 

Yeah, Yo, Yo 

I want to know, is the promise land heaven or hell? 

'cause the niggaz that made promises, most of them fell 

If you hungry, then I got some niggaz servin' the shells 

With no sauce, and they silver, only take one to kill you 

It's a small world, so you better guard your secrets 

And it's easy to get money, but it's hard to keep it 

Never was the one that like to hound no bitch 

All I do is try to keep niggaz around me rich 

Screw all-a-y'all cowards, I consider you lames 

Had to save my lunch money just to get in the game 

That was back when I used-ta have a mean back-spin 

And no mack-10, it was just bats then 

you know, beat a nigga down, take his rope 

Now we-a, heat a nigga down, take his coke 

And you can call me if you want to bye them thangs 

I get 'em half-price 'cause papi know my name 

Call me, Jay to the mmwwaa 

And everything you got in your livin room, I got in my car 

'Cept for the bar 

I try to put a little money away 

'cause you know they say, tomorrow ain't promised today 

Either bubblin' or strugglin', nuttin between 

Or have a grimie nigga like me, fuckin' ya Queen 

And the Kiss only do shit with niggaz I know (that's right) 

And the outside nigga can't fuck up my flow (c'mon) 



[Chorus] 



Jay to the mmwwaa, hustle coke, ryde or die 

Kiss hand-wash money, let it drip dry 

Jay to the mmwwaa, keep cowards on their toes 

Kiss push the drop, rock the ice, get the hoes 

Jay to the mmwwaa got the smash on the block 

Kiss got the label's tellin' niggaz not to drop 

Everthing you get, you really don't expect 

'cause when you Jay to the mmwwaa, you kiss to the death

He has a little game that he plays
Clever little ways and a hot boy style
Brags about the dough that he makes
Flash a little cash most girls wild out
Lately he's been checking for me
Telling me how much he wants to be
Wants to be the one to replace
Replace the man that waits at home for me

But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me

Something's dying to see

Telling me how he could blow my mind

And I'm a pay both y'all rent

When I whip the V you can hold the joint if you with me

Jadakiss,"Yo this nigga Drag-On burn niggas, flame niggas, potch niggas
Sautee niggas, skin scorch niggas
You could be any complexion, black, caucasian
We spit razors in kiloid faces
Like ear to ear, eye to eye, lights out
Cross the throat, couldn't say you gave her mouth to mouth
Better keep your teeth togehther 'cause when we put our heat togehther
We tie em up with they vest and hit em up all in they chest
We stack ones, trick on bitches, fuckin bitches
Leavin bitches, don't have no problem buckin bitches
I kill a chick steal from my crib
Right in front of her child, with no feel for the kid
Gon kill that bitch
Not now, but right now, go 'head nigga, do it!
Blau! All up in her nightgown
Feed the crib, Fed description, kid wit no meat on his rib
But keep the heat by it, so when why'all creep keep quiet

[Chorus]
You can stand the fuck up if you fire your gun nigga
But sit the fuck down you ain't firin one nigga
Yeah we set fire in cribs, and fire in whips
Why'all niggas use the fire when you cookin your bricks
Other niggas use the fire when they lightin they spliff
I want my tires on fire when I'm pushin a whip
I put my block on fire with the product I sell
It's the Opposite of H2O, hotter than hell

While why'all niggas pop the Mo', I inhale smoke out the optimo
Choke, hydro til it's time to go
Cheeba my smoke, I plays ping pong
If why'all hooked on phonics, that mean here's ten buy your own chronic
We buy cars, 4, dot after it, get gas in it
Go fasten it, then crash in it
Me and Jadakiss, truck kiddin with the chip
Burnin up and make em..., sorry officers I only got my permit
To the fake cats, who shank niggas, break bats
Stay 'woke, 'cause make hats, take naps
Put him to sleep faster than a needle
I come with four niggas stuffed in the beetle
With some bats and beat you
You a bad bitch I had to meet you, had to pop it
Bounce, before I fuck broads I unlock it
And back to the block to check the spot quick
We snatch niggas reups and hit em for they bodies
Tell em keep the profits

[Chorus]

Yo, first it's Drag, dash, On
Then it's the cash, fuck it all I've been in cabs
Not alone, but with the mask, with the heat
Drop me on 42nd street, quickly
With the crackers, tell em pack it, out they pockets
Hurry up, all this walkin around I'm gonna stop it
This gun I'm gonna pop it
'Cause at this time 12 pm my gun is all you might be seein
If you sight seein
You might be in, a hearse, then casket, then church
Then you aten(eaten) by the maggots
Fuck you hatin bastards
It's over for why'all niggas once Drag take his mask then
Why'all know it's straight platinum
Earth, wind, water, the 4th yo, is the Opposite of H2O
That's one of the elements I use to melt the mic
Ryde or Die, well we gon Ruff Ryde and keep the family tight

Come on, huh
Come on, yo, yo, yo
Some people blond peeps, red banjies
Some are moving quickly, outta town
How they gonna find her moving swiftly?
Five steps ahead of the best so that's nothing
Twenty steps ahead of the rest they left stuck
And in they face not, what not?
I can't stand broads
Ridiculous niggas practice for the title ""hard""
Me pick of the litter
I was born to bubble why'all
Born to change game shit born to stand guard
Play games you left nameless, fame hard
Promise that it's never painless
Nigga be hard
Convinced that you can take over the Eve
Eat nigga let starve
Strong as a stallion maiden
You better dart
Is she feminine with pretty women friends all dimes!
Timberlands is how I like my men and all minds
Rough ryde you niggas hard head, soft spine
Pass the word
Must have the stacks to cross lines

Money might make you grown
But you still need a dog to take you home
And make you moan
You ain't gotta see the bank for loans
All I do is party and bullshit like when Frank was home
And you got it all boo I got it all too
A four, five, and a six and they all blue
And I don't care what she think

Eve hungry for a meal baby Eve get a bite
You nice and you might get to see it daddy, tight

And the same thing I pulled on them
I pulled on you
Come on now how you think I pulled your crew?
Got my own crib so you can't kick me out
I'll call one of your friends to come twist me out
If you know Jada then you know what Kiss be 'bout
Just for fun I hit the bank and pull fifty out, uh ah

But I'm stuck wit, what I'm stuck wit, cause I don't suck dick

Sat with the players and I stood with the coaches
And I'm a always be in the hood like roaches
Flow is ferocious, dough is ferocious
Two guns by each lung with no holsters

And I control all the fish scale in the city
And still make your first week sales look pretty
I come through, all you hear is chip in the muffler
And you could ask anybody if the Kiss is a hustler

[Chorus]
Styles: He's a hustler
Jadakiss: I hustle anywhere, any town, any borough, any strip, uh
S: He's a gambler
J: I always hold it down, gettin bankroll in 4, 5, 6 in trips
S: He's a gangster
J: I always make the paper and the FBI got me on they list, that's why
S: He's a Ruff Ryder nigga, Ryde or Die nigga
J: By the way, did I tell you that my name is Kiss?

And I don't understand how a broke nigga could chill
When a two liter'll dust you so get you a mil
Yes I got loose ends, poppin out the sunroof of the blue M
I'm like Lou Sims

And I'm a make sure they hit you wit both shotties
I think this summer's gon be the most bodies
You never ask a nigga in jail if he chillin
Just make sure you make all the sales in the building

'Cause now niggas think it's all right to tell
And you could put out some garbage and it might could sell
A lot of niggas be petty and sheist
But that's only til you treat 'em like a video and edit they life

This is a threat, when I talk you listen to death
And if I run out of money then my wrist is a bet
And the streets said they wanted more Kiss
Up north niggas pop me in, and do a hundred more dips

[Chorus]

Yo, whether it's dope money or rap money, gamble the shit
Trey pounds of Mauseburgs, handle the shit
Got too big for the city, cops brought in the feds
So we moved across the map and brought in the bread

Niggas chill for a month and a half, no ruckus
Got the pictures of baggers and all of the gun busters
And you know how it go, 'cause it rarely'll change
Everybody got a license and a alias name

We don't smoke when we hustle and none of us talk
Back to back til we home, we can front in New York
'Cause some of us is runnin' from court
Smokin' weed, mumblin' thoughts

Tryin' to stay humble for shorts
We could do this the mob way and kiss you on both cheeks
Or do it the hard way and shoot through your gold teeth
Stand on any block, play cee-lo and craps
And break niggas for they pack money, then give it back, uh

Hey, living in the fast lane
Driving fast 'broads'
With them fast 'chains'
When you pimping through life
See some people get caught up
And some charges brought up
With some people they shoot up
Hey, there it goes again
Different face to the same old tragic end
Who's to blame if he never saw it coming
Yet he heard the bullet humming
And he never though of running
It's too late for him now laying out on the ground so cold, so cold
Nothing much to live up to, damn
It's so far gone, so gone

Living in the fast lane
Driving fast broads
With you fast chains
When you pimping through life
See some people got caught up
With some charges brought up
From some people they shoot up
Hey.. tell me when will it end
When the baby pays for its mothers sinning
Trapped inside the four walls of a 'penty'
Way too strong, way too strong
Now she's out in the cold, dying slow and the spoon still warm

[Jadakiss]
It started when they birthed me
Running round stuck in the project now he can't wait to the first come
Little older now and can't wait till the dope come
Sleep all these years and nobody awoke him
Getting it so he can cover the whole border
Question is how many of us can hold water
It seemed like telling is in 
Signed states get an order of protection and tell him again
I'm a left lane
My life is much faster than yours
I'm with a chick and its attached to a brawl
Got the air ones matching the car
All white, slinging all night
So we rapidly spar
That's what they want to clap at me for
Understand that the flow is like the coke that he naturally grows
So I'ma get my cash on, and my mash on
And get my ass up out of the fast lane

In everybody's hood with other niggas' hoes
I'm throwin' paper at them bitches
Screamin' So So
Now every spot I hit
I'm hearing different shit
About homies that want me that weren't with me when I started this
It's fucked up but I
But I can't let these niggas blurry my vision
On where I'm going and how I'm living, ya know?
I got a daughter now, young age three
If her daddy don't shine, then my shorty won't eat
Feel me?

So the only thing I could do was hold it down
Now this is something that I could tell you that's no bullshit

Was like he wasn't even there 'cause we ain't agree much
Used to be gone for whole weeks at a time

Fucking, running with the niggas that was hustling

Never stop or look back we still going

Double are and Interscope, put that cake up
And we ain't go platinum but we made niggas wake up
Got 'em all talking 'bout pumping the brick
And they only go and see papi to get something to sniff
I'm 'bout to fuck the game up for real like in the World Series
Nigga that parachute down in the field
I don't rap I provide you bars
And the pain is invisible, but you can't hide the scars
So y'all never be on the level that we're on

Treat my guns like my dogs, let 'em bark all day
In a three floor condo with the spiral stairs
Made it past the front desk, then the rifle's here
I'm the motherfucking big shot, I get down
Wit a 17, 16, 10 and a six shot
Fuck with Kiss get your wig rocked
And if you're smart you'll bounce when my motherfucking shit drop

[Chorus]

Yo, I'm a pimp girl
Catch me at the bar with a bottle of Cuervo
Mami's rubbing my webo
And this is what got me the ass
Honey said her drink was hot so I put my watch in her glass
Then she ain't even want to get breakfast
She just want to hop right up in the truck and get reckless
Top from the club all the way to the exit
Ask me her name, couldn't tell you if I guessed it
My bitches don't know nothing, don't say nothing
And they pay for everything, I don't pay nothing
I'm a white tee pimp, fresh headband
Dirty denim, Timberland, or a Nike pimp
I like to eat shrimp, and I don't keep a broad long enough to love 'em
Now dog that's some deep shit
Cause I don't believe in hoes exploring
No matter how bad you are you gone in the morning

Why y'all get on Hot 97 and, talk wit a baritone
Wit two niggas downstairs with licensed guns to take why y'all home
Scared ass niggas, you think they going take a life so they can get life [nope]
Ask Puff they ain't trying to hear that nigga
For no cake, and why y'all can get at us on Labor Day
We make stones that say ? your moms labor day
I'm in the hood so we can link up, any place you think of
Hand held don't hold prints plus I burnt the tip of my fingers
I'm a Bronx gangsta nigga, double are's hoodrat
The nigga they come get quick bitch, on this hood shit

Why y'all bitches think the riders a joke, well I don't play (let's go)
I blow you whole fucking shit up like Tim McVeigh
Gimme the needle, not tomorrow, but today

I ain't the shit that you see that's on the top of your church
I put a bomb in your baby carriage, brick through your hearse

Tell your CEO, don't call my CEO apologizing (sorry)
I'm at your wake in the choir standing harmonizing
It's Infa-Red the shit that be on top of the heater

Hold Camby sister the hostage, then send 'em a reef
So stop fronting vegetarian just scared of beef

Yo, hey suck my dick bitch, the way this chick spit ridiculous
Here we go again, only we on Kiss shit
We coming and you keep running
You keep claiming you the best that done it
Pussy let me see something
Fake niggas screaming ""Ryde or Die""
Same niggas we run up on and make 'em cry
Outta all the camps in this game, nigga
We the champs in this game
Who kick the real shit before the fame
Fuck you fat ass, fake bad ass niggas
Still play the hood while you ride past niggas

Hey yo, I ain't got a care in the world
Kidnapping your kid, maiming your mom, and airing your girl
And like, you ain't got a care in the world
I'm hopeless and numb, I can't see but I can focus my gun
And I'm down for smoking blunts to the head
My nerves is shot, my paces is short, I dump in your head
I'm the hardest nigga out you outta know it by now
I'm the nigga that they talk about going to Chao

The nigga to salute, the quickest to shoot

Arteries hitted, hawkin, they neck is shit
I'm the motherfucking hardest
I smack the shit out of any one of your artists
Whatever the label
Why y'all niggas don't want beef, why y'all want meat at the table

Yo, If I miss your head and your neck, I'll hurt your chest
If you from the streets betrayal is worse than death
And I'm known for getting money, not known for wildin
But I'm real I could rock both phones in the island
This is how we even the bets
I kill everything you love dog, right now, even the pets
Everything got dubs on it, even the vets
50 close, then 50 wide, even the sets
Cause the bullets is like calisthenics when I'm squirting
When they start hurting, that means they working
Only way we coming is hard

'cause these ain't the type a slugs that'll get lodged in your chest
Got a night time scope that can see through the walls
So just to get shit cracking i'ma tear up you're dog

Still put the pump in your baby mother mouth make her mumble where you live
25 years no felony I'm telling y'all
Why you think I saved it, to blow a nigga mellon off
As a young boy always carried the cap gun
And fell in love with it first time I clapped one
Now I'm a grown man more mature and pleasant
And like hitting niggas in the jaw with the dessert
And everybody gotta gun why not me
You gotta keep it on you now its just like I.D.
And I never seen a man cry till I seen a man shot
Fuck pride bullets is too damb hot
So if you ain't got one you gotta run
Handle it 
Or tell the whole world that

This goes out to, all the infants
in this cold world that was born addicted
And to all the section eight kids
Just remember these four words y'all, we goin' make it
The government keep on trying to fool us
The system, keep on trying to lose us
And all we can do is keep buying computers
And ? all now 'fore it start going down
We gotta hold our head, keep our pride
Though it hurts when I see people sleep outside
Little babies with no socks on, eating popcorn
We all know what they moms and they pops on
Out go the love when the drugs come
They never got nothing for Christmas, and they ain't Muslim
This is a jewel, a lot of us was them
This is a jewel, a lot of us was them

To my shot down niggas keep your head in the sky

And that's why there's red in my eye
Cause people don't know what the ghetto is like
Either you make it out, or the terrible life
I don't want to be a broke bastard
And everybody in the hood got somebody in they fam' with a coke habit
You work for minimum wage
I'ma get in the game, get shot or a bid in the cage
It's a risk I gotta take - and I'ma be the nigga
with the bricks and the stash and the biscuit outta state
And even though I'm blessed with the gift
I gotta move cause the pain and the sickness gotta wait
I go extremely hard - why let up?
And I can breathe long as I keep my head up

Tanktops, and jean shorts, we Niked out
Headbands, and four wheelers
Jeeps and Coupes and convos, about who know more killers
It's all wrong but it's all right
It's a small world, matter fact it's a small life
We all trip but the way to survive
is hold your head and make sure you fall right
And it's a quite fact, that whatever goes around comes right back
It's just like that

Everybody in the struggle it gets greater later
Never say can't, it's better to try

then her hair would drop down to her calf
I knew her man, he was just up North
and would've got left up North, but he was the chef up North
Anyway I'm K-I-double
All I do is get dough, spit flows, try to stay out of trouble
If you ready we could move, just lose your man
or hit the dance floor, I'll show you how to do my dance
Or I might let you play in the garden
Or sit up in that white thing and listen to the greatest of Marvin
The estate got six locations
Take so long to get to the front once I missed probation
And I hate to brag
I know ya man really wouldn't like the Baretta but he'd hate the Mag
And yeah here go a blank check, rock yourself out
But in the mean time girl, knock yourself out

Or you can get real freaky start poppin yourself

it's sorta like you watchin yourself, uh
Front if you want, I puff a few blunts
and take a cruise in a Porsche wit the trunk in the front

The coupe blew her mind when she couldn't find the door handles

Keep dancin, cause I like how that ass shake in them capris
I'm like Big wit the murder mamis up in Belize
but I'll still fuck a chicken head like Lil' Cease
I don't care if they model, bet they all gon' chill
First nigga to cook base on a Foreman grill
And you might win some, but you just lost one

Her hands and her feet look like a mill in cash
I love when I call and she still in class
Instead of down in Bloomingdales stealing bags
And you know ya man Jada shoot through the hood
She look so good that the chickenheads can't hate her
Ever seen a dime? she a hell-a one
Still make her hop out and cop me a dutch, a vanilla one
Taught her how to murda the highway
Put her up on mean shoes like Roberto Cavale`

She shake it up in the club when I'm over them hips
Waking up to the turkey bacon over the grits
Orange juice and the newspaper over the clips
Later on she gon hook up spaghetti
She ain't worried 'bout Herm S shit she got it already
She said she knew about the game cause her father was heavy
Then she asked could she borrow the Chevy
I could zoom in the jag
She going shopping need room for the bags
I sped off in the joint like it's Raspy's world

She don't play no games, I love her for that
Or hang wit no dames, I love her for that
I told her roll for dolo, leave the chicks
Attitude, reflex leadership
And the sex is incredible, I love her for that
How she fit me in her schedule, I love her for that
And she like making love by the lake for hours

Down in Miami done seen my bitch - now
I don't know, what you've been told

[Jadakiss]
But I'm on my way to Cali to see my bitch
And do a movie but first I gotta read my script
After that I get it popping at the La Mentage
I'm getting skull in the Ferrari, bottom garage
Then it's back to N.Y. to my project bitch
She like to do it anywhere, a real hard head bitch
And she enjoy riffing when I'm gone
But love when I say I'll be there in a minute, listen for the horn
I'm down in Atlanta to see my bitch
She go to college, she model, and she got chips
Rock La Pearl lingerie
Tattoo on her ass that say that this belong's to Ja'
Now I don't know, what you've been told
But 'Kiss be blowing they mind and spending they dough
And I'm going on a lil' trip, I'll be back
Anybody looking for me, just tell 'em that I'm

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
I'm on my way to New Orleans, for one whole month
To see my shorty in Magnolia, she got gold fronts
We don't kiss; matter fact I only hit that once
But she chill and she like to smoke big fat blunts
Then I'm swinging through Detroit to see my boo
You think you got every color mink? She got two
And she just slapped a hundred on the
Honey was a gangstress for real, getting money off the board
Then I'm hitting Chi-Town, soon as it die down
Lay up in my chick's house, break a couple pies down
Nobody can do this but 'Kiss, freeze
Music please
Where was I? Oh yes
Off to the Valley so I gotta go West
My chick got the gold Benz and the gray Lex
I hit her with a shirt on cause she got fake breasts, see man

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
That I'm on my way to Philly to see my bitch (yes)
She talking shit on the celly like she that bitch (yes)
And this how you know it's definitely real
When you drop the CL-6, then you knock Stephanie Mills
When I get there, she goin' show me more than some brotherly love
Top piece till I cum in her mug
I'm trying to leave and she giving me hell
Told her bend over, I'ma crack that ass like the Liberty Bell
Now I'm on my way to Texas to see my bitch
I ought of be there by breakfast if I leave by six
And ain't nothing stopping Ja'
I'ma get the puss, catch the Rockets game, then be on my way
Now I'm down in Miami to see my bitch
She got her own beauty salon, and she strip
I'm proud of the girl, backside's out of this world
The bitch perform, besides that, her lips was warm, see man

It's the J-A-D-A I got beef with the feds and the D-A
I got footage in the game press replay
I got bitches in the club all over me ma take it e-asy
And y'all scared I can tell
and I'ma get Buckss like Milwaukee cause like Sam I Can-sell
I'm that nigga y'all know that
Bang you in the yard then slide off on the early go back
In the streets I flash the cannon like Kodak
And I spray threes so say cheese
Already told you I'm looking for enemies
Double R so of course it's better
I love cornrows and Farrah Fawcett feathers
It's a message in a glass bottle read the letter
Money in the bank membership Visa sweaters
And we ride or d-i-e together

Nah, fuck that put ya hands down
Come on put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that put ya hands down

Y'all know I got the master flow, fast or slow
Y'all wanna know who the best is aks ya hoe
The honies don't lie they love it
And they cop for real trust me dogg the thugs will dub it
'Kiss hit you with consecutive hot shit
Therefore nobody never gon' spit like I spit
Get money just to walk through off the books
So when you mention my name shit is off the hook
Shirts is off, titties is out
And you know I'm there the hardest niggas in the city is out
I'm in the club ice over the thermal waitin for you to try me
When the lights get low I'ma burn you
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Flirt with the hood rats then pop models
Gotta slay two or more, ma that's our motto
And y'all might get down with the team if y'all swallow

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Kiss the game goodbye, the game is mine
You thought wrong change ya mind
I'm the nigga that'll pop the king and scoop the queen
and take over the town with a ruthless team
New S-Type wagon, future green
Gun heavy pants sagging I'm used to cream
Who you know can make a million dollar bail on cash
Never did a day and got the jails on smash, K-I double
I move the perico quick, and just let manteca bubble
'Kiss been a boss, y'all just start working
Now put ya hands up 'til ya arms start hurting
Don't put 'em down 'til I tell you
Whoever wanna be hard headed then find out what the shells do

Yo, yo, yo, yo, hey, yo
Never will it stop
Hang guns with double digit shots
I move work on other niggas blocks
Leave out the club wit a another niggas watch
Body that man and let other niggas watch
Only thing worse than a coward, is a coward with power
Gotta kill him in the shower, hour
Beats is knocking, hooks is rare
Earned my spot, nobody ain't put me here
Burnt my block, I had a fiend cooking with beer
Like the Bobby Wilmack of crack
Might see me in the Burgundy thing, or the black on black
Matter of fact, go get ya chrome
Cause I rather be, broke together than rich alone
Clapping em' down, backing em' down (uh)
Fuck what ever happened before, I'm what's happening now

Now gangstas live, gangstas die
Grab ya guns, soldiers ride (show discipline nigga!)
Kill ya moms, kill ya pops, kill ya seed
Kill ya girl (Its principle nigga!)

Sell ya E, sell ya smoke (you hustling nigga!)
Grab ya nine, grab ya pound
Grab ya tec, grab ya pump (you busting at niggas!, what)

[Nas]
We brave hearted, I had bitches trying to poison me
Niggas who kilt loyalty
Set me up, vested up my move accordingly
I ducked icepicks and ice sticks by cops who rookies
Hard to be righteous, and when life can just stop for pussy
Niggas killing over hoes, guns concealed in their clothes
Bodies at funerals, touch them they feel like they froze
Speech, totally calm, holding dead rappers ? in my palm
Burning flag, plus its on the qu'ran, its on the bible
Plus America cause that every car that's driving
Holding the ? you focus you know its Nas then,
Prince of the globe, leave no prince of the toast
Played with Ouija boards, burned frankenchise with a ghost
I've learned, to do good plus a waste of evil
And do what it takes to keep a smile on the face of my people
I was raised by the apes in this dark creep show, but yo

Think bout when I splatter ya mask(yea)
My niggas is happy, ya momma is sad
If ya niggas is riders, the drama will last
If ya niggas is snitch, been judging my ass
They said I'm too famous to run
So when I empty out this clip, I'm changing the gun
The realer the beef, the longer the clip
Murder ya mans, I'm gone in the mist
Call this girl after dark so we talked the bitch
We ain't care cause the whore wasn't shit
Doll, I ain't taking the L or wasting a shell
I bring the heat like I'm Satan itself
Fuck if you hard, fuck if you soft, long as you lost
Dick in the dirt, shit in ya drawers
Ill make ya grandmother get on the floor
Tie you up, then beat you to a pulp, say that this is a war
If in the four, mackign a pump, acting I dump
Throw you out the window then act like you jump

And it been that way, fuck how a nigga live it's gon' end that way
Niggas is part of a game that I don't play
Never catch dog carrying what I don't weigh
That's three 45s, one 38, 173 pounds straight out the gate
I don't hate, got no beef but knock a nigga off quick
And I'm mad like a bitch and a nigga with a soft dick
Get off this, fucking with X, but on some other shit
Why the fuck you fucking with X? You must be fucking with X
Go catch a chicken, fucking with me you goin' catch a whipping

How many dogs you let go up, still getting down

Why y'all niggas gonna know when we hungry, you get stuck up

What's up? Fuck a nigga yelling
Why-O motherfucker for real, yo Kiss tell 'em

Sheet could kill, stomp niggas out boot the grill
I'll give you a reason why I'm the truth for real
Niggas can't fuck with Kiss, I mean that
Had to stop eating red meat cause I ate too many Beanie-Macs
I'm not one of them niggas and since you so righteous

They gotta use the scale that they weigh the whales with

Carlssons on the jeep, Bugatti made the prototype
Hoped you'd get the picture but you just can't photo life

Determined niggas make it
Kicking down the door and we burning niggas naked

The house costs a million, sitting on the beach
And the only thing I know, if it's furnished I'mma take it

My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
We got the shit that the government got
Talking money then you rubbing the spot

Real niggas say that they be wilding
We on the Cayman Islands
On a yacht with our favorite albums

A bad ho and a plate of salmon
Smoking and drinking, nigga is you thinking that our fate is violent?

I love my nigga for the fact that he real
And nobody on the faculty squeal

And if you facing capital pun', pass me a gun
And I'mma give you time to run while I rapidly peel

Gun work's official but niggas don't be wanting that
(Why?) 'Cause they puss and they mans is lame

Why we don't laugh at death, and cry at birth
Never say you can't do it 'til you try it first
Be the young niggas eager to pull it
But it's a message in everything, trust me, even a bullet
Go to war with the 8 and the pound
Think you got your ear to the street now, put your face in the ground
'Cause my shells is expensive
You'll know exactly why when you yellin' in intensive

Lucky 'cause I got guns that crack your back
But that's not what I prefer, I manufacture crack
And niggas turn bitch when you show 'em the steel
But we know how to bid so y'all go 'head and squeal

Eating right, getting good rest either on the bar or the phone
I'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years

Everybody gon' follow the bitches
Until they realize, bullets gon' follow the stitches

[Chorus]
[Bubba Sparxxx]
Uh, uh...
Boy, silly if you saw them crackers ridin' with them pigs
and thought I might would hit this robe for less than twenty-five a gig
Doin' sixty-five, I sled off acid and shitty bourbon
Took a minute to adjust, but right now this big shit is workin'
I'm white just by chance, but I'm country by God's graces
Nowadays I find myself doin' laundry in odd places
But still, I keep it Bubba even into Mr. Kiss and them
Brought 'em down to Athens, let 'em cut with my sister's friend
Now we gettin' blist again, back on the block in Yonkers
and Tim done laced a track, man this shit is hot as bonkers
Kiss, not to flaunt ya, but just tell 'em Bed has come here
I'm doin' for my family, but why'all are really done here
But Bubba is the truth and perhaps this is discussion
Of wither I'm that deal or a product of Tim's percussion
why'all know to him is bustin', so just dap me up and frown on
Me and Kiss is necessary, that much you can count on, yeah

[Chorus]
[Bubba Sparxxx]
How did him and Bubba rise from this dirt and this cow feces?
To show you folks the hope for this changin' shall be me
Notice how he see, the picture for it's painting
and poured you up of this mixture before it was tainted
See I was rydin' ruff only when me and D became aquatinted
and I pledge to maintain it, be damned if I'ma change it
This shit is anus, ain't it? Fuck 'em, Kiss bring it home
I ryde or die with Beat Club, won't bend for the sake of this song

[Jadakiss]
The streets is still mine, I stay with the still nine
and it's still long and if I'm stronger than corn like I pinkeyed
Niggaz pretend to be weeded, that's what the industry needed
Kiss flippin' his flow, enemies heated
But we gon' let the gats pop
From the old rifles on the dirt road to the handguns on the blacktop
Don't get the plot wrong, this ain't a black or white politic thing
Cocksucker, it's a hot song

Introducing, Jadakiss and Styles P, where you at?

[The L.O.X.]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
You know we still in the hood dog, in front of the store
With the work across the street and the gun in the stall
Soon as somethin happen niggaz want to run to the law
You know the code of the streets, never run to the law
That's why I can't even run 'less I run with a four
or I walk with a three, come and talk to 'em P
You can catch me down bottom with a bird and a glock
On the block makin money where they murder a lot
Or you can catch me up top shootin dice for a yard
I'm talkin six digits, niggaz bet the house or the car
You can catch me hittin the spliff, sick in the pit
On the fiend like I'm missin my shit, they think I'm crazy
Catch me hittin your lady in my Mercedes
Bird on your baby, fuck you I'm keepin it gravy
L.O.X. hold the hammers
like we waitin for screws
With Angie Mar' BLOWIN MOTHERFUCKERS OUT OF THEY SHOES, WHAT?

And when it drops, game over, you'll see
Introducin, Beanie Sigel, tell me how you livin?

[Beanie Sigel]
Aiyyo, I've been kickin murder - since Adidas with thick strings
T.I. sweatsuits, Pumas with thick chains
Four finger rings, black belts with brass names
I was spittin flames since niggaz was pitchin change
I'm a hard knock kiddo, always played the middle
Threw flacks in the crack game, getchu if I can getchu
Since a buck, played the highway, dodgin the troop boys
Jumpin in and out of Coupes, wavin for Duke boys
Always chased a penny, copped quarter waters
Tried to make a dollar chased my pop's boss daughters
Tryin to make my name, global, in all four corners
Philly baller, gamin in all four quarters
Never worked, never will - all my hoes buy my clothes
I can't go broke, never will - all my bros buy my O's
I'm the best thing that linked up with New York since Sprewell
I murder, nuttin further - fill in the details

[Brett]
I'm here, it's over, fuck how why'all feel
When I drop, why'all gon' realize it's all real
Bein left for dead, tied up, smoke 'til I was dried up
So high up, seem like the sky ducked, high what?
Life was rough, but now it's nothin to hide
Used to click and be quick to put this gun to yo' side
Be like, ""That chain nice - I like that pal.
Matter fact {*click click*} I'd like that now.""
You've got game? Call the name, just spell the name right
Brett, one of the best rappers ever to touch a mic
It's prophecized I'd write, spit scriptures mind blowin
'til my coffin top close and heaven skies open
Fear no man's my slogan, I hope why'all believe
I'm just like you, fear nuttin human that bleeds
My mind breed two movies, six ab-lums, a hundred poems
Thirty R&B joints, I'm beyond the norm, why'all just mad
I'm just glad, got my time to shine
why'all the type to hit three hundred bars and run out of rhymes

[Angie Martinez]
Brett, from my ByStorm family, with Angie
Come live from the streets, from Harlem to Q.B.
And when it drops, game over, you'll see
Introducin, finally, the legendary cool G.

[Kool G. Rap]
It's B.G.S. kid so what you facin? Caps racin
Decapitation twenty buck-fifties and lacerations
Guerilla fam' camouflaged out in the grass waitin
to blass your nation slash like Jason and bash your face in
We ass lacin top bodies and half in the basement
Our style, cast you so bad you'll need plastic replacement
When gats is raised in, fascination blastin and blazin
Evacuation for your whole staff there's gas in the tank and
Gets back abrasions from cap grazin, defy gravitation
Pull my shit back squeeze bust it like masturbation
Hold fort, hold the blow torch, leave your soul scorched
with no remorse, the state of New York, get your shit caught
When niggaz hawk, let the fifth talk
So tell me who's the next man to flip?
I stop the beef shit, with rubber handled grips
Your candle get lit, guerilla shit feed us banana clips
The hammers hit, anything in our range we dismantle it

A pound of weed, four guns and a liter of booze
Chew niggas out they shoes, what
Come and fuck with me, I can guarantee you'll be makin' the news
P flows like no nigga, twenty-six but I'm a old nigga
Don't make me fuck around and show niggas
How to leave a room flat, twenty niggas dead
No money, no jewels, bullets in they head
Ain't a nigga you know could fuck with the god
I said that was just a hobby, gun bustin' the job
But the sickest niggas out is the bitchest niggas out
And I could take em on the street and straight whip 'em in the house
Come through in the prettiest Porshe, the grittiest wars
State gotta talk till the city get hoarse
I'm the icin' on the cake, gangsta of the state
Guns, money you wait, who you fuckin' wit' dog?

Bust for my niggas, shh, hush for my niggas, all of us survivors
I'm a Ruff Ryder
You got a gun on you, I got a gun on me, both of us could fire

I just deal with the tension and stress
Understand I'm from the School of Hard Knock and my suspension is death
I keep the P-89 twenty shot in the coat
Better squeeze soon as you see me, you plottin to loat
I'm a little more than itchy
Motherfucker, when it's time to splatter your mask I burst your kidneys
So go head and get your sons on me
Like I give a fuck, like I'm givin' up I got four guns on me
Get down and dirty, all by my lonely
I leave your brains on your block all around your homies
Live by the code of honor, stay holdin' armor
I treat beef like a album I promote the drama
Stay bustin' a hammer, sweatin' a smile
And I make sure these motherfuckers'll regret when I'm wildin'
I'm the hustler on the block
With money on his mind and some bricks in his hand, P can't be stopped, what

[Chorus]

You're dealin' with the ghost of the past
You could sleep if you want, and get fucked with this toast in your ass
I'm the gangsta and a gentleman, I hope you the best
And tell you play the front seat and then choke you to death
Throw the gun to the chair try to open your chest
Get blood on the driver's face, window and dash
Burn the car with the body in it, bring you to ash
I get down on a hit like I'm Sigel the cold
That nigga sniffed up yo coat I could bring you his nose
If he stole money from you P could bring you his hands
The nigga talk too much I bring the ears of his fans
Need weed to calm down, need money to leave light
Fuck a watch cause my time is tickin'
Fuck a chain I'm already hangin'
Fuck a gang I'm already bangin'
Robbin niggas is my only form of steady payment
Play it sweet I might be in your house
L-O-X black mob Holiday and I'm out

Lick a shot for the predicate felons
And gangster niggas that know that 
Doing their time is better than tellin
Don't tell dog, lick a shot for the graveyard shift
And all the hustlers on ninety-five for the graveyard prick
Lick a shot for this weed I need
Just to see clear, to tell the truth I can't breathe a Ki
Lick a shot for the stick up kids that twist up wigs
that's the shit that happens when you pick up bids
Lick a shot for the foreign car, American trucks
Old timers that'll throw a stack of presidents up
Got dice shooter slang, need a pistol to hang
But the P understand cause the ghetto is fucked
Lick a shot for the fiends 
That got to go see the minors on the block to get medicined up
Lick a shot for the sake of licking a shot
And every time I'm far away from home I'll be missing my block
D-Block nigga

[Chorus]
Lick shots for the hood
Yeah nigga we good
Lick shots for the poor
We still gotta run from the law
Lick shots for the rich
I-95 moving them bricks
Lick shots for the crew
My niggas'll ride and I ride too

Someone lick a shot for D-Block cause that's what I'm on
Lick a shot for the niggas that ain't survive the storm
Lick a shot for all my niggas on the run
And lick a shot for all my real niggas that got bodies on they gun
Lick a shot for my niggas cause I know they'll do the same
For my niggas that run through the flames and walk through the rain
Lick a shot for all the niggas growing up in the slums
Blowing they spliffs with they razor blades under they tongue
Lick a shot for all my niggas that be banging they hammers
Sticking up stores, taking the tape out the video cameras
Lick a shot at all y'all haters whether smaller or bigger
Lick a shot cause Hood ain't never been scared to pull a trigger
Lick a shot for all my niggas that be pumping they crills
When the beef start cooking they be bustin' they steel
Lick a shot cause I ain't scared to
And lick a shot cause I'm prepared to
Crack a buckle with the matching hair due

[Chorus]

I lick shots for my niggas in jail
23 hours in the hole, on life parole
My jackmack niggas, octopus wildin'
Closest food they ever gettin' to is city island
I lick shots for C-E-O's that hit niggas off for weed and don't care if you bleed
Just mind they business and go the other way
For the right price they could get you the yay
I lick shots for my thug ass niggas that'll put something in you
From they car and hit your face through the diner menu
Your body get numb, you swallow your tongue
Cough up blood, that's the work I do, what
I lick shots for my niggas that's not on tour
And gotta hustle to eat its the motherfuckin' way of the streets
Pay attention

[Chorus]

Lick shots for the little babies in the projects
Running around unsupervised with sharp objects
Lick shots for papi that give you the yay half price
And niggas that ain't ever been heard but they mad nice
Nobody tell when I squeeze at your men
Lick shots when your diesels at ten, I'ma see you again
Lick shots cause my record is clean
Middle of the street, broad day lettin' it scream
If I'm lucky they'll squirt through your back
And after that I'll make sure I lick shots for the purple and yack
Lick shots just to guard your grill
To my nigga T and Green and my uncle and Arthur Kill
Lick shots for the S-L 6
Cherry red with them chrome things on it with the x-l lips
Lick shots for the niggas who got shot and ain't here
They say life goes on but it ain't fair

That money get dropped off, so do he
Right off the booth of his mama' building
Feel the drama building
Told why'all niggas don't fuck wit P
I said fuck rap and a verse
I get down like the bishops, wit the way you clap at the hearse

And your girl visit two years, mom come forever
But near one of your mans ain't right wit his shit
But like corn I'ma flip, smokin' weed influenced by the fix
And old timers with the toolies by the hips
So come and creep wit me
And I ain't lyin' when I tell these motherfuckers
That I got the streets in me
One felony, wit two cases beat
So be about your business when you come and beef wit me
I got coke for sale and I got dope for sale
If you want to cop some work you oughta come and speak wit me

Why'all niggas know my name, but you don't know my style
What make it all ironic is the shit is the same
Keep a milli in the coat, puffin on the chronic
In the hood wit my niggas that's distributin' 'caine
If your man get bodied, number one rule is you body somethin' back
Then live with the pain
Young guns of this shit, so when I get hit
I'ma yell Sheek and 'Kiss let's finish the game
I got discipline and dedication
I'm the boss of the S N F, that's the Shootin Niggas Federation
Light a blunt and get cloudy wit me
Go get your gun and get rowdy wit me
It's a Holiday dog, mouth big, you could swallow the four

That's how you keep the love unconditional
That's why we the only one the thugs listen to
Bitches buy records but niggas do what bitches do
I know a few dudes doin' life bids in jail
And they way smarter then the white kids in Yale
But that how life is
And that how the gun and the knife is
It's a shame but it's real when your enemies like ya
When ya come through and fishtail in Hennesey Viper
Listen, it ain't the rappers it's the rats that worry me
Double R for life, D-Block til they bury me
Scared niggas shed off
Or stand in the back and aim they gat up in the air and
Let off
Through niggas tear nigga head off, then let the blood keep drippin'
And just wipe the sweat off

With two guns out the sun-roof
Salt fish style
Who that kid?
Black mask on with the latch on, the AK
Swing on my shoulder like a Louie bag
You get it in a hurry
All up in your Burberry
Through your assistant
Through your fucking secure-tary
All y'all do me a favor
Walk with me

Say you can't judge a book by the cover 'til you open it up

Used to chill and the smoke didn't bother you
Beauty of a rose, scent of a flower
Love when I tell her to, get in the shower, hit it for hours (wooo)
When I thought you was able to cope
That's where things fell apart ma, then it stagnated us both

I squeeze my shit, I don't wave it and leave
why'all motherfuckin' extra lame
Here's the game, when I shoot seeds, your man can catch your brain
He looked a hero when he drove the taxi in the hallway
Shootin' niggas down if they clothes is tacky
Get an 18 or brick and my clothes is khaki
And the Porsche got a glass roof
The blunt got a live purple haze in it, little bit of hash too
See me when I pass through, fuck around and I'ma blast you
Do what I have to, tryin' to get my math too
I leave a message, ain't a phone I use
I call my niggas, bat 'em down, they bones I bruise
Leave 50 niggas dead, niggas know my groove
Another 20 more engine niggas know my tools
I got a gun, you need to stand fo'
FUCK YOU BRING YO' MAN FO'?!

[Chorus: Styles, Jadakiss, Eve]
Styles: S be the ghost, Double are What
First come the hawk, then next come the toast

Jadakiss: K to the are Double are what
Send mad cowards on they way to Allah

Eve: E-V-E, Double are What
First lady, I just point, they squeeze
Ryde or Die, Double are What
Better keep your hammer right by your side

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I gave you the best flows
On top of that, I even made niggas set goals
I want to know how many bullets can your flesh hold
Thirty-two, or whatever the tech holes
My dirty crew rather hawk you to death rather than talk you to death
'Cause listenin' is like livin' when yo' talkin' is death
So why'all better start readin' before you start bleedin'
And the odds was against us before we got EVE-n
Niggas in the hood don't give a fuck if you rich
Or drunk with the Prince CD own, bumpin' a kiss
Nigga frontin' I get my you in the pump kinda hot out
Hit the button put the roof in the trunk
Play the block with the Royal Blue 45 and make your mouth leak
Can't fuck with NY
Get my diesel from South Beach
you ain't got a ride, getchu a cab
ya' bitches is mad
Eve got the shit and smash

You want to make it ugly, can't do nothin' 'bout it
Angry at the public, buggin' me
Rat bitch, pot bitch, hungover hot bitch
Wantin' all that money, fuckin' gettin' all that rock, shiiit
Scared of who? huh, we goin' get rid of you
Climbin' the walls wit' gimmicks, that shit is pitiful
Dawgs close by me, so why try me
They wan' cop me but they too sloppy
Damn, I gotchu stuck in a box
You feelin' trapped, got your stomach in knots
'Cause I ain't lettin' go

So, tell 'em hoes to fix they wig
You see my stomach all round, my dick all big
And my guns come mixed like Robin kids
N.O. fuck ya wife, snatch ya ice
And my coke come white, like Barkley wife
Can't stand how, these niggas be frontin
Dumpin off 8 shots, ain't hurtin nuttin
And who gives a fuck bout, who's spirits is better?

But nigga I talk guns, that's usually hot
And 9 times out of 10 they gon usually pop
It's like herpes, it won't go away, it stay hot
Man, I be spittin like these niggas is dead
Cause I'ma get my money, these niggas is dead

I got the feds on me, I'm supplying the coke
And don't flash no money, I act tight broke
Cause man, I'm in this game with somethin to prove

I ain't just up here, rappin' and tappin'
Spittin' and skittin' and shit, naw, not me
I'm not you, I'm not you rapper, I'm not you, Pusha

I keep that ziploc bustin' at the stitches, culinary chemist
I serve the malicious to break the fiends fixes
One give you the sniffles, the other leave you with the itches
Transport, airport with the vaseline

So I can fulfill my dreams of passion as green
More cash then ya seen within Ashton it's green
Me drivin' up fast with the lean, zonin' family
Keep youngin's in them rented Camry's

Door panels full of shit and I ain't full of shit
Reckless ass, God forbid they don't crash
From the panel to the dash, it's four pounds of slab
Naw, bitch we don't believe in air bags

Cars turn tricks like them Ringling brother skits
Whether bitch hop out or the glock pop out
Ya know, what I'm about
Blow to ya sinus 'til the snot drop out

Whoever said birds fly south for the winters, a damn lie
Got 'em right here and if I don't like you the grams high
Take it or leave it, soon as a fiend, taste it, they need it
They could smoke it right in front of you to make you believe it

Prolly think, I won't murder you the way I smile
But I'ma take a lota shots, A I style
Jada, the name is filthy but so what
The motherfuckin' game is filthy

You know, what? My mom and my pops really did a good job
But it was the Montega and the Cane the built me
So I could never hate on another brother
God is great, the devil is a motherfucker

When you broke but they think you got money
Crackers start showin' you love, ya own people act funny
I tear niggas heads off, I don't discriminate
Waves, cornrows or dreads, I will eliminate

I'm far from a noodle, nigga, I stab up block reps
And turn quiet streets into hot sex
Nigga, that's funny you say you a killa, how?
What is it the return of the killer clown?
You don't put no fear in my heart

I make ya people say, 'wow', that didn't look like my man
They flipped upside down, the coroner did what he can
He got hit wit ten rounds at pointblank and pointblank
Coldchian left that nigga stankin'

Half static and face I got the wrinkling, slugs all in it
I had my eyes on his mink and I didn't give 'em
A chance to blink when I dodged up on 'em
Pressed the forty up on him shocked 'em
Made his head stand on end and like a baby I rocked 'em

The Coffin, the cradle, you can't bite the hand that made you
That's the beginning of the end and you a thug that pretends
Carl Coldchain, suit the nigga, I got a great vision I see through men
And squeeze triggers wit' bullets that go through men

Fuck wit S P, that's ya date with death
Got bullets that'll grape ya chest, no sleep like I hate the rest
I'm in the hood like it's my fate to rep
I hold it down any place I step and I love gettin' slept on
'Cause I'm rawer than dope fresh outta Africa that never been stepped on

Dog, I'ma clap at you the minute that you rep wrong
Holiday, the ghost the main reason why ya set gone
Why I love riffin', the war you wouldn't understand
'Cause my God is different than yours

If the world spin in a circle, I want 'em to learn move backwards
Kill niggas the first minute they jerk you
What you keep the toaster for creepin' through the hood
And shit ain't really good but I'm deeper than the ocean floor
Higher than a plane and meaner than a baller
Want ya insides out so I mean it when I pull

Rappers is talking to me as if, come on
We in the same boat, I tell them quick, no, I move Coke
And you and I don't share no common bond
So forgive me if I don't receive you with open arms, no

It shames me to no end to feed poison
To those who could very well be my kin
But where there's demand, someone will supply
So I feed them their needs at the same time cry

Yes, it pains me to see them need this
All of them lost souls and I'm their Jesus
Deepest regret and sympathy to the street
I see them pay for they fix when they kids couldn't eat, so sorry

And with this in mind, I still didn't quit
And that's how I know that I ain't shit, I ain't shit
My heart bleed but that's aside from the fact
I live from my kids and their's and them youngin's after that

[Jadakiss]
Yo, yeah, aiyyo
We can do whatever you want to, I promise
Fight, play razor tag or spit lamas
I'm two guns up over the roof
Hopin at least one hit your upper gums over your tooth
'Cause a lot of niggas jus talkin
want to kill a nigga on a record, when they see 'em they jus talkin
In my case, I'ma jus hawk 'em
'Cause niggas is waitin for a lawsuit, it's hot and they walkin
They sendin dudes up like clockwork
Niggas that can't hold it down usually come home with artwork
Ain't no such thing as a smart jerk
Then again, one fuckin dumb-dumb can make your heart jerk
D-Block nigga, we got work
That old school grey shit, uncut, got niggas pops hurt
You ran off Broadway, I get top work
Minority report, you don't know what you got murk, that's why..

[Chorus: Benzino]
Everybody want to call your name
Until you squeeze them chromey thangs
Everybody want to call you out
Until you pull up at the house
And everybody want to try and bluff
Go head nigga press your luck, what's up?
And everybody want to call your name
Don't wait, jus please call my name

[Jadakiss]
Dear God I got eighty five forty five bullets in the Tommy
With a extra thirty clip in my back pocket so try me
I'm on the yellow lines on one knee
Tryna hit a nigga in a building in One-D
Yeah, D-Block, you hatin the unity
I bring it to your motherfuckin gated community
In case you ever get it in your mind again
Twenty lil dirty niggas, with no guns throwin Heinekens

[Benzino]
By the time you hear this verse, I done staked you out
Me, V nailed and hearse, layin at your house
We screwin silencers, put a muzzle on that AK
Rip that nigga shit in half, make that bitch pay
Annihilate, every piece of ground you walk on
No need to talk on coward, I get my chalk on
It's always one nigga on the side
Talkin out his mouth next thing you know he bleedin from his side

[Chorus]

[Benzino]
Are you crazy? I was in the dirt since '87
If war is hell, then will I ever go to heaven?
The D duck, Zino bring the Tommy when I re-up
Four and a half is nothin, get your ki's up
You boys stop bluffin, before you get beat up
Take your car keys, throw your ass in the trunk
Slide off with your bitch, L.E.S. track bump
Cats still can't figure me out (What?)
Askin how this nigga in the game gained so much clout?
Fuck whoever want to claim king, I lay you down
Take your chain and your ring, you can keep the crown
I told your man the same thing, he can eat these rounds
Lacerate your face, pistol whip you unconscious
Your block never did so I know you can't want this
You rap a good one, but I see it in your eyes
You like to bang on wax 'cause you don't want to die

The triplex with the spiral steps and parkade floors
I just want to lay you down 
The way you look, the way you smell, the way you sound
The way you be putting it down
The nights awight but nothing can compare to the morning
'Cause that's where the love is real at
Up and down in and out tell me can you feel that


Ohhhh, baby I didn't come here to fight
Why you want to mess with me? 
Ohhh, I'm always willing to compromise but you ain't controlling me 
'Cause I..I came here to make love not war with you babe so try
...I to find the ways to make me feel good
Up and down in and out that's what love is all about
On our knees both of us feeling good and so helpless
Up and down in and out love keeps moving us around 
To the beat like a drum
I don't know if I can catch a rhythm
Ohhh you know me better than I know myself
So why you keep teasing me?
Ohhhhh can't see me being with nobody else cus you love me so crazy
'Cause I came here to make love not war with you babe 
So try to find some ways to make me feel good
Up and down in and out that's what love is all about 
On our knees both of us feeling good and so helpless
Up and down in and out love keeps moving us around 
To the beat like a drum
I don't know if I can catch a rhythm (repeat 1x)


Well girl you real lady like and I'm real hood 
But at the end of the night we both feel good 
And I don't want to control you I just want to hold you
And I know I flip sometimes but I'm supposed to
When I don't mean to come off rude and all that 
'Cause I know you and your sexy mood and all that
Nobody get wetter than you do believe me girl 
I know you better than you do, believe me 
Its always in the back of you head
How we go from the jacuzzi to the balcony back to the bed
So perhaps we discuss it a little 
Can't change my attitude though maybe just adjust it a little
Then I'm gonna keep being thug 
The only time I disarm myself ma when we make sweet love
I'm gonna protect home base can't catch the rhythm 
Then we gonna make our own pace
You know I'm in a sexy mood so why you gotta act the fool tonight? 
You need to change your attitude 
'Cause I ain't arguing with your right (repeat 1x)

Many bricks could move, (you can say 20 a block)
Many niggas'll ride (you could fill a football field)
(How much money you got?) You think I signed a football deal
(My nigga give me the word, I'm gonna kill that lane)
You know major league niggas play the kidnap game
Have the kid missin' for days, listen and pray
(And I'm kill 6 of your niggas, 6 different ways
And we still got exza of rhymes) Still gangsta
(Try to run up on the guy, that send your legs to your mom)
And we still got kilos of coke

And for the dope I'm gonna catch it)
Make sure the joint ain't point blank so they can't open your casket
My whole crew (got glocks on 'em)
In a hurry to shoot, (like they put shot clocks on 'em)
All that gossip we blast, better see if they possibly has
A V12 ambulance that will get you to a hospital fast
(We done came out the cages in shackles
I ain't call a pager to track you
I'm loadin' up gauges to whack you
We been riding together
And us back and forth), it's like puttin' Saddam Hussein and Bin Laden together
Soon as you get a crumb, they want to bury ya
That's why I travel with a semi, like Eddie in ""Coming to America""
(Silencers, it sound like it's hummin' when I'm airin' ya
Won't know you hit, 'til your body start numbin' in that area)
The kids don't want to see the toast of mom and daddy

In a toasted armor Caddy

Yah, I'm back niggaz
Ha Ha why'all don't think the kid gonna come back why'all crazy 

[Drag]
I rock a Burberry hood, my hood is very hood
My gat is solid metal, my bat is heavy wood
Drag is under rated, my coke is heavy weighted
Why'all want to be a blood, well that's wut I'ma soak your face in

Coughin' up blood, I soften up thugs I make a nigga show me love or throw me slugs
I'm in the club with groupies, and groups of threes So getting ran up on the block by a group of Dee's
I've been shot three movies, my deal comin soon I'm past sellin crack I got pills comin soon

And I'm not no dancer, my moms got cancer 
So I ain't celebrating shit, until these doctors get the answer
Prolly never get a Grammy never get an Oscar But I got a twelve foot fish tank with Piranhas and Oscar's

I ain't gonna ask who shot ya, nine times out of the ten I know who did 
I know your bitch, get at 'em Kiss

[Chorus: x 2]
Tell your friends, I'm a tell your friends (my friends)
We can be friends, on the weekends (be friends)
You know the ladies love gangstas with paper (weekend) 
Especially when your team wining like the Lakers 

[Jadakiss] 
Fall back respect, learn how to love a nigga
You only alive, on strength of another nigga
I've been nice all my F'in life
A big house I only slept in twice

Rhymes so dope, that it should be kept in rice
The mistakes I've made, shall be corrected in my second life
Nigga I be in the booth relaxed, I seduced the track
And beat it up like I produced the track

So another line bout a gun motherfucker 
And I'm a pass one to you, blast one through you
You don't got adrenaline, ass run through you
I run through cash, cash run through you

I could do the job myself, only way I prolly ever be broke if I rob myself
I don't know whats worse a hate or a fag
Double are D-Block daddy, Jada and Drag

[Chorus: x 2]

[Drag]
I was hated by many, loved by few
But respected by all, so fuck all why'all
Why'all doubted my skills, I never relied on this deal
I don't give a fuck what why'all feel, foreal foreal

This rap shit is nothing but fake love, alotta fake hugs
I rather go do a jook's , to feed my thugs
'Cause I could look through a nigga, like a glass shield
See he ain't real, my flow is like acid pills or pcp I'm like Morgan Freeman, 

The way I make tracks lean on me
I got a house my walls is plush, my floor is plush
Drugs by the barrel, in case it all get flushed
Spring is back, along with Drag

I just coped a light jacket and the longest Jag
I'm who you nigga love to hate, but glad I'm back
Why'all heard X is retiring, but Drag is back

Uh, I learnt the game, I know what I want and I'm in it,
The time is now, it's gonna be up in a minute,
You look a nigga in the eye, you could tell if he tinted,
These fake rappers getting by with these hell of a gimmicks,
They act like it's all love, only love is your money,
So when it's over nigga, are you a thug or a dummy,
I'm neither, but I been hot so long, it feels like I got a lifetime fever,
And I ain't gotta spit, I could cough and still eat ya,
And fuck rap I make mills of reefer,
I'm a man first, tired of punching niggas, so I'ma shoot niggas cause my hands hurt,
And God is great, guard ya space,
One hand wash the other, both wash the face,
And I head crack so much, it's hard to ace,
.38 revolver flow, its hard to trace, what!

[Chorus: Styles P (Jadakiss)]
Fuck that, pop off till nothing in the clip left (pop off)
Till nobody in his clique left (nobody)
Hole in the head, slashed or the split chest
If they asked what happened (tell em it's the Kiss Of Death)
Hustle hard till none of them bricks left (nothin left),
Stick it up till not a crumb on the strip left (take that, take that)
Make sure ain't a chain or a chip left (uh uh)
If they asked what happened (tell em' its the Kiss Of Death)
Tell em Kiss (The kiss of death!)

This is LOXville, and even white America'll let y'all negros know Jada got skill
You a jackass like Johnny Knoxville,
So I can jus imagine how ya pops feel (damn!)
And you ain't worth my shells, so you should just imagine how the Ak feel,
A lot of niggas is thousandnaires, walking round town, fronting like they got mills
For what it's worth, I'm one myself, but my strength in the hood outruns my wealth
But you still might catch Kiss in some hot wheels, New Bentley coupe, with the stock wheels,
Haha, look how I get back to it, I send my young niggas to do it, in the black Buick,
I don't spit bars, I distribute the crack fluid,
All I'm really waitin on is for niggas to act stupid

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
To all my real niggas, sorry for keeping you waiting,
It's ironic, but the god was beefing with Satan,
I love y'all tho, my niggas for even relating,
This ain't Kiss talking neither, I'm speaking for Jason,
When you a problem it's harder to keep them from hating,
Niggas jaws, is like laws, don't easy to break em,
If I wasn't on some shit, I'm getting on it, come to me with ya hand out to me, I'm spitting on it,
I don't want to hear what happened, matter of fact, I don't even care what happened,
Might as well declare the clapping, 'cause my bones is old,
Gotta lot of wear and tear from scrapping,
Hate a nigga that, ain't never there to see shit, but always hear what happened,
The thing better than money, is respect,
No love this time, nigga, Kiss Of Death, what!

Work wit me
I want to thank y'all for coming out
Tonight
This is sum reel' shit

[Jadakiss]
First things first
When a nigga money ain't right
That makes things worst
Now he's just breathing he can barely manage
And he's way past starvin
He's really famished
His right-hand man is up north, that's hurting 'em
His cellphone bout to cut off, spring jerkin em
And his baby moms starting to do her thing again
She left him for a nigga pumping e up in Bengaltin
If his money is right than maybe he can diss her
But he can't, and niggas is breaking his little sister
His pops just past
His mom use to be an occasional sniffer
Then she started fuckin with the gas
Dude use to be a star back then
He had the benz CL something
But he just turned his car back in
Mad carrots pawned all his rings
Took this thing next thing I know
Money pawned all his bling
Now he just like everybody
With the same old plans
That can't get over the hump
With the same old grams
They was on the block making fun of him
He slid off came back with his hammer and killed everyone of em

[Chorus]
Cause when I come through clear it out,
Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
When I come through clear it out,
Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
When I come through clear it out,
Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
When i come through clear it out
Play the sideline and observe

Me and B.I go man to man
I know niggas with an asshole
Full of parole that go hand in hand
Fuck hot that's humidity
And you can't mix money with stupidity
Even though I get my coke from Columbia
My cars from Germany
And my guns from Sicily
Nothing personal but I was raised different
Hold my joint sideways so I blaze different
Give it to anybody fuck an age difference
From those in the world to those in the casket
Rub the kite on your chest and swallow the stamp
At the end of the day they still gonna follow the champ
It ain't about being lyrical
Cause when I get in the booth
I make miracles and I ain't stared at you
But I'm in tune with the hood so I'm better than you
And when you see me comin you know what is better to do

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
can't lie all I got is my balls and my vocals
And the only security I roll wit is my social
It don't look decent
It's like niggas left they crew in the hood
And went on the rode with the president
Had it up to here with this fake shit
They don't even want a nigga to earn his
Just give and take shit
Just make sure you mention my name in the top brackets
And make sure you mention your name as the top fagot
Trust me this go around I will not have it
I putting niggas heads to bed like crapmadics
How you think your man died
More money than respect
And it wasn't close it was by a landslide
Listen my nigga your work is sloppy
And I don't love them hoes but the purple got me
If I don't don't do it with music I'ma do it wit poppy
Just play the sideline and observe and watch me

Jadakiss,"Top of the food chain, its just the way that I do things
The dungaree seats in the blue range, I'm working with new change
A Gemini nigga with mood swings, had the fiends lookin' for new things
I stop playing with birds, and started playin with words
The money wasn't right so I had to stay on the curb
And I'll be a player later but for now call me ? Kiss
If not that, mon take it Jada, I kick hard balls and blow hard weed
And be everywhere 'cause I move at God's speed
And my aim is make y'all bleed, y'all got embarrassed in da class
When the teacher used to make y'all read, uh huh, mind over matter
And that's all good, but fuck that my new shit is spine over bladder
And everybody tryna get to the top and that's all good too but right now I'm on da ladder

Look at you then and look at you now
don't let this cold cold world bring you down

Look at you then and look at you now
don't let this cold cold world bring you down

I know your queen got her eyes on me,
I got my eyes on your queen, the SMG is Heineken green,
bad thing is you know before long, that we gon' get it on,
my kit cost thirty and ten to put it on,
No tints, windows clean, heavy windex, gears on the steering wheel
I shift her with my index real life is just in another form
Kiss of death, its about to be another storm I'm a goddamn raging bull
Stay outta jail by just telling myself the cage is full
Got niggas on the payroll just to squeeze, you in no position to challenge my expertise
They get a bonus if they leave you old school
From the era of the 45 with a penny on the needle
Ball to the bosses so please don't violate or cross him
Or you'll be the corpse and the corpses

Look at you then and look at you now
don't let this cold cold world bring you down

Look at you then and look at you now
don't let this cold cold world bring you down

Uh uh huh you know the wold anger is just one letter short of the word danger
And I ain't no stranger, never use a gat more than twice if you don't clean it
And never say fuck something if you don't mean it, and when it comes to life
The root you been using thus far ain't working far right, take the scenic
Whatever faith you got, put it in a crook, want to hide something from a nigga
Put it in the book, trust me this album the vapor gonna go around if you ain't hot
You need paper to throw around ya its getting clearer everyday
When you wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and say

Look at you then and look at you now
don't let this cold cold world bring you down

And if you broke now nigga when you see those chips
Watch how many people come out of nowhere
And try to beâ?¦

Just makes more prints the older I get
The Bible starts to make more sense
When I drive by and give you the horn, I ain't flip
I'm just handling my business and keeping it going

Instead of pieces, I'm getting the lumps for real for real

Hoodie under the suit jacket, double-breast that
I'm in the hood like scratch-offs, get them packs off
Lame niggas cuffing them whack whores
Use of the pick going back door, no more for the fake
Just stand there and I'ma dish it back off
Might lay it up, might not
Niggas don't be in the wrong place cause it's me in the right spot
I'm quite hot, y'all niggas is quite pop
The record don't sell then I still got light rocks

Past few years shit got so ill
Kinda hard for the god to laugh through tears
I went through something with momma, no drama
Something that came and went, real life karma
My pop think his son is deserting em, its hurtin em
Guess I gotta be the man, sit down & work with em
My little boy 7, he the sequel to the thug
So I told him the money will never equal the love
Listen I'm grown why'all, when it comes to my family it's never a problem
It's only a phone call, the tend to take that and run with it
So every other month I be on some new number shit
They violated Stay again, Gus totaled the beamer & broke Kay leg again
Shhh, let us pray again and I ain't get enough of hanging in local bars yet
Had to let the thang off, cross town in the projects
All these rumors, shit I ain't get robbed yet
Bitch ass niggaz ain't stop actin like broads yet
And arm reach off a gun & a mask, somebody clipped me for a hundred in cash
Still feel me, I hit the road try to get more grip
It was cool til' a mutha fuckin tour bus flipped
Uh, no charges brought up, bitch popped up with a kid
Got caught up, then I put a court up
Now The road the the riches is taking me longer
It ain't kill yet so it makin me stronger

The keep a nigga going, rappin for a reason
Shit don't just don't happen, shit happen for a reason
I'm that dude, like it or love it
I do my thang in the hood, get right with a budget
Ain't afraid to give my life to the public
And when you see me next time maybe we can further discuss
How my 16's give you a visual
I know you thinking he ain't really selling, how he life off residuals

Being I can't go to jail cause them years'll cost me
Don't get me wrong, lay a nigga down if he force me
Rather just sit back and roll a dutch
Think how I'ma put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how I'ma get the 'caine over Customs
Never underestimate niggas, or over trust them
yeah them M's is right in my face
I just gotta throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it don't jam, the Tech will spray
When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray
Cause I'm a nigga that hate to settle
I'm a man of the Lord but I still can't escape the devil
Moved away and still can't escape the ghetto, what

So bring the heat, that time is over
While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder

Call my bluff, start acting up, and I'll leave you underground

I know how to get my pairs off me
They can cry and die from high blood pressure cause tears are salty
It's a symptom if you bobbin your head
Know that he's sick, know the flow is ridic', now throw him a grip
When I get it, you already know I'm throwing them bricks
Putting purple everywhere, daddy, I'm throwing them nicks
That's right, homey, you can't move me
I ain't going nowhere, I'm in the hood like bootleg movies
All you shooting is the breeze, a bootleg uzi
I'm just waiting on a que like Suzie, don't lose me
These penitentiary chances that I take
Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
But I invest my bread into something else
Into something else that'll make something melt

if not rap for the fact of how real he is, whatever

Hey yo, niggas know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap, now he put out two anthems a year
And I just want to rock for a century
Then chase the book with the documentary
If you, can't do nothing other than flow
Life's a bitch like the mother from ""Blow"", let's go
Don't make me put your heart in your lap
Fuck riding the beat, nigga, I parallel park on the track
Hop out looking crispy, fresh and new
In the six, but it's a BM, and it's Pepsi blue
And, I don't know you.
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through
Y'all ain't fucking with Jason
After I cash in, there's really no justification
Of how I'm gonna change the game, so don't get outta line
Cause this little nine will change your frame, what up

The next best thing to a soldier
Go hard with a fat ass and a head full of rollers
Just look in her eyes and tell she's real
Just imagine the way she smell and the way she feel
And the sex was crazy then and its crazy still
And you know I'm from the streets so it's crazy ill
And we waitin' on a new island

Money is great but what we got is more better
We got the four letters
When it comes from the heart it's more pleasure
And for the fact that you trust me still

And all the nights that you sat up and bagged the raw

The determination and dedication and discipline
Listening and catching the jewels that you was missing
And they still doing coward shit

And why do niggas lie in 85% of they rhymes?
Why a nigga always want what he can't have?
Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag?
Why did crack have to hit so hard?
Even though it's almost over
Why niggas can't get no jobs?
Why they come up with the witness protection?
Why they let the Terminator win the election?
Come on, pay attention!
Why I sell in the stores what you could sell in the streets?
Why I say the hottest shit but we sellin' the least?

All that I’ve been given
Is this pain that I’ve been living
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that?
Tried to make it my way
But got sent up on the highway
Why? oh why
Why they gotta do me like that?

Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar?
Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it?
Why they didn't make the CL6 with a clutch?
And if you don't smoke why the hell you reaching for my dutch?!
Why rap? Cause I need air time
Why be on the curb with a ""Why lie? I need a beer"" sign?
Why all the young niggas is dying?
Cause they moms at work, they pops is gone, they living with iron
Why they ain't give us a cure for AIDS?
Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days?
Why you screaming like it's a slug? It's only the hawk
Why my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York?
Why they forcing you to be hard?
Why ain't you a thug by choice?
Why the whole world love my voice?
Why? Try to tell 'em that it's the flow son
And you know why they made the new twenties?
Cause I got all the old ones

Go baya baya when I shoot 'em

Now the streets ain't safe at night

So don't sleep when my Jeep creep up, how we hit 'em
Empty the clip, then dip 'cause we did 'em
Lickin' of shots for Latasha that's proper
Love for my niggas but a glock for the coppers
So what the fuck you want to do now
I packed a .9 last year, in '99 I'm packin' 2 now
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man, 
But nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas

Running through the pissy stairwells, I ain't hear nothin'
Bugging, only thing I remember was the bullshit summons
So I stopped at the 2nd floor, ran across, cracks is falling
My pockets is mean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy
The walkie talkies them D.T.s had, black, they was rated P.G
Run, I will not give up, no, quick flag the car down
Take me to.. Ghost here they come now!
Errr! Pull off quick, back up, hit the bitch dog
Turned down Hill, light the Marley spliff
Run! I will not get bagged on a rock
Run! I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops
Run! They amp shit, plant shit, destroy evidence
Fuck a case, I'm not comin' home with no fifty six
Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me in shit
Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop
Curse, swerve to get served, these cocksuckers got nerve
Heard I was killing shit, they must got word
That I told the chief of Rich Port I don't wanna merge

Run! If you sell drugs in the school zone
Run! If you getting chased with no shoes on
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got, guns!
They givin' out life like wontons

Clear twelve-twelve's, that look like stuffed shells

Don't leave nothing unbagged, shave everything
I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything
They come by one more time, they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she getting knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dipping with that
Uh, down-shifting on 'em like I got gears on me
(Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me
(Run!) Scared to death, running like I got bears on me
(Run!) My Timbs start feeling like they Nike Airs on me
(Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the Thruway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm trying to hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at
And I'm ashmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
Imagine if I would of let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do

You niggas lost y'all game; I'm throwing the Roc down
Just to put y'all D, I'm back on the Block now (uh)
Running your mouth, 'fore I shit all in it
All y'all ass, and I'm about to dig all in it (ew!)
I birthed you niggas, I fed and I burped you niggas (uh-huh)
Quick as that, I will Earth you niggas
Clothed you niggas, wiped the snot from the nose of you niggas
What not to expose you niggas
Fist, knife, or razor fight
I got a year and a day, still played it like they gave me life
Can't walk through the jail without shackles and two cops (uh)
Throwing shit on the warden outta the food slot (uh-huh)
Got connections with pop, he boofin the weed plants (yeah)
Get my khakis washed and pressed for a few stamps
Respect in the jail, a check in the mail
I stay on the phone; I don't put collect on the bill (mwah, ha-ha)

[Chorus]

Ay, you better know I'm going all-out, whatever the cost
So fuck whoever hating', I'm the king of the South
You gon' forever see me flossed, Spyder with the top off
Third gear I got lost to the million dollar law
J.G. the one who told the bitch to take your tops off
I'm a seven-figure nigga, paid the cost to be the boss
On the streets or behind the wall
Lift weights; get straight, 'til it's time to ball
Even if I never sell a million times at all
Dope boy trap niggas, I'll grind for y'all
Pimp Squad, D-Block I'll ride for y'all
A-Town to Y.O, see the Chevy ride slow
With the light turned down and the beat down low
Throw the 40-cal and K's out the window
You better do like Lil' Jon told you ""Get Low""
Cause you can catch the crystals, when the chopper-missile hit you
I ain't waiting for permission, I'm a flip until it hits you

Hot like the real fever (the real diva)
So successful yet still so eager
No matter what they say it's on forever
(It's our time right now) more than ever
(To the death) we are going to get it on together
And M-C, you know we belong together

I lost a part of me, when you left boy, can't you see
Boy come back baby please because we belong together
Who am I going to lean on when times get rough
Who's going to talk to me till the sun comes up
Who's going to take your place there is nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be wit you
Only you can make it right, make it right, make it right

Bounce in a lemon range (skip in a hummer lime)

Bobby Womack's on the radio singing to me
If you think you're lonely now, wait until tonight
Boy I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, crying, trying to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song is not even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby (let's go)

You going to need a shoulder to cry on
Classic Mustang Cobra to ride on
Past is the past, just let it be bygones
Matter of fact I know a fly song that we could vibe on
Let's get it straight

All my niggaz all my bitches
Get high get drunk get wild buck fool
You know my style get crunk
Bitches bounce niggaz bounce
Let me give you that funk shit blunt shit
While I make you bang it out your trunk

[Verse 1 - DMX]
You cats, talk slick but walk quick when the dog hit
The dog hits coming back to the raw shit
Aww shit they done let me back out the gate
Back out to tape back out to rape
Back off the chains so please back out the way
Before I blow ya back out with this fuckin AK
Don't give a fuck what a nigga say no matter who he sound like
Make sure you know what the rain is but its gonna be coming down like
Cats and dogs hold up it is cats and dogs
Keep fucking with the dog its gonna be cats in the morgue
Twenty- two million sold lets keep it real
Most y'all killers ain't even twenty- two years old
Ain't never felt the cold wet behind the ears
Know what real pain is cried real tears
I go hard bogard and stand my ground
Fuck y'all niggaz it's how its goin down baby

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Jadakiss]
It just don't look right
Bullshit coke don't cook right
The judge ain't throwin the book right
Should thank the lord that you blew up softy
Don't talk greasy you grew up off me
I ain't letting go of the block
And if I get a good enough grip I ain't lettin go of the lock
If I happen to pinched I ain't goin to shock
I'm gonna to get aquatinted with niggaz in general pop
Stop but don't hate 'cause everybody got a lil blood to donate
Thugs'll go ape the women'll come around
Shortly after that is when the jealousy sets in then they'll shut it down
It's just raspy nothin on the neck wrist ware just classy
No way I'm letting this money just get past me
When all I had to do in the first place from the beginning was get nasty

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Kartoon]
Niggaz been waitin' for that west coast shit I tell them to go fish
Blowin purple in a purple Laker jersey wit the gold kicks
Bitches be like Toon you a mutha fuckin trip
Hop in the whip and lean til that mutha fucka flip
And every club in Cali crackin' its gangsta town
Keep a couple of niggaz with me that'll bang you down
Now lil mama put switches on and make it jump
Before me you needed Lil Jon to make it crunk
Naw for real come to Cali player take ya pump
My New York niggaz leave y'all wit razor bumps
Now pappa raised a rolling stone I feel like pops
In the absence of Makaveli I feel like Pac
Even though I got the deal I still might pop
Right in front of the po-po you could feel my shots
Man all my niggaz carry bangers we feel like SWAT
And that's the reason why Rialto feel like Watts

I am tired of the bullshit competin' with these other chicks
You don't know what to do with this you act like
Guess What nigga I am leaving you and guess what
I am needin' my keys from you
I was so stupid for love
Thinkin' you was everything a real man can give me and more
But guess not nigga
I'm leavin' you and guess what I'm needin' my keys from you.
I was so stupid for love thinking you was everything
A real man can give me and more but guess not nigga I'm leavin' you
And guess what I'm needing my key's from you.

Nigga hears he photo I gotcha comin' up out her front door
Thought you had me fast but damn you didn't know.
Every time you paged her she would page me and tell me you were there.
And that's a no no I let you go for months thinkin' so wonderin' why you haven't hit this
In so long I'm a smart bitch and I gave you the rope and now your hangin' there.
Tell me what in the hell your thinkin' not Keysh being home alone another weekend not Keysh
I let you get away with this nonsense for to long ain't gone be no more callin' this yours

[Chorus]

Now you wanna conversate sit back talkin' about the mistakes you made
When I was on your plate Nigga now hold yo wait now wasn't you the one sayin'
I guess its safe to say now every man you meet now has a tendency to cheat shame on me
Because if you new it was the same hold you to everything you thought she would be stay off me.
Tell me what in the hell your thinkin' not Keysh being home alone another weekend not Keysh

And I can't lie I'ma miss pulling your and hitting it from the back hard uh guess what

But at the end of the day ask me if I give a less fuck.

So now you gone try to play me yo I'm tired of this bullshit get the fuck out take all your shit
And get the fuck out.",Guess What?,2005
Jadakiss,"Uh-huh, you know where I'm taking this
I'm taking it right there, they leave me no choice

She said she was a model for a year and a half
And if she took her pins out, 
then her hair would drop down to her calf
I knew her man, he was just up North
and would've got left up North, but he was the chef up North
Anyway I'm K-I-double
All I do is get dough, spit flows, try to stay out of trouble
If you ready we could move, just lose your man
or hit the dance floor, I'll show you how to do my dance
Or I might let you play in the garden
Or sit up in that white thing and listen to the greatest of Marvin
The estate got six locations
Take so long to get to the front once I missed probation
And I hate to brag
I know ya man really wouldn't like the Baretta but he'd hate the Mag
And yeah here go a blank check, rock yourself out
But in the mean time girl, knock yourself out

[Chorus]
Oh you modelin momma? (knock yourself out)
Wanna let ya hair down? (knock yourself out)
Oh you ready to move? (knock yourself out)
Whatchu wanna sit in the Coupe? (knock yourself out)
Wanna keep on dancin? (knock yourself out)
Wanna run in my mansion? (knock yourself out)
Sit in V.I.P.? (knock yourself out)
Bitch you just wanna be seen (knock yourself out)

Now you can knock yourself out like you boxin yourself
Or you can get real freaky start poppin yourself
And my watch got so many rocks, when you look at the time
it's sorta like you watchin yourself, uh
Front if you want, I puff a few blunts
and take a cruise in a Porsche wit the trunk in the front
She had the Jocko Bijou sandals, told her hop in
The coupe blew her mind when she couldn't find the door handles
Attitude very high maintenance, check this out ma
I'm runnin out of my patience
Don't sleep wit me? Then don't speak wit me
And never talk bad bout niggas that eat wit me

[Chorus]

Aiyyo, honey know I'm waitin to leave
Keep dancin, cause I like how that ass shake in them capris
I'm like Big wit the murder mamis up in Belize
but I'll still fuck a chicken head like Lil' Cease
I don't care if they model, bet they all gon' chill
First nigga to cook base on a Foreman grill
And you might win some, but you just lost one
Kiss mis-educates 'em like Lauryn Hill

Yo things was all fine when the sun was shining
But when the rain came that's when the pain came
Sittin' up in the Range
She feels some kinda way
She doing strange things
But I ain't with the games
Just keep it a secret yo
It's cheaper to keep her bro
Two wrongs don't make us right
But we equal though
It's getting better though
And I can't sweat her
And I love her
But I can't let her know
I can't let her go

Have you ever been in love?
Well well well
Have you ever been in love?
Well well well

She was 5 foot 4 from the floor
Prettiest little thing I've seen before
Her body was so tight, had her hair done right
But who's shorty with tonight
I got that big boy sitting outside
All I need to know if she'd mind if I took her for a ride
I couldn't wait to meet her
On that first date to treat her
I just wanna please her

So we jumped up in the Range (jumped up in the Range)
Shorty started acting strange (so strange)
Her attitude began to change
As it began to rain (began to rain)
Shorty started to complain (oh yeah)
About every single thing

Every time I think about her
I can't make up my mind 
Well it's hard to explain
Just the way I feel about her
Well I'll tell you what I know

And I don't care what my friends say
I just can't let her go

Two years gone by, I
Trying to find the reasons why, I
I always seem to make you cry, I
Just don't know why
Well could it be
You always running in the streets
Come home from work, ain't nothing to eat
You stretched your little dough running home for more
Then you're straight back out the door
Somebody tell me, baby

Even though we fuss and fight
Cussing all through the night
She's in my arms all the morning light
We wake up and make up
Even though she gets on my nerves
She take shit that she don't deserve
Tell me what's a woman like that worth

[Chorus]

Now I finally realized
You're like heaven in my eyes
I took a long time, I apologize
Even though at times you messed up
Shaking your ass up in the club, that's messed up
But you're quick to hit the block when the crib get hot
When my dough get low, you be holding me up
But I'm still out here chasing
Out here baby making
What a brother gotta do

Money is nothing
Whatever Kiss wants is gon' get purchased
House so high in the Hills, phones don't get service
Just listen, even though we be riffing
Without you around, I think things would be different
And not for the better neither
My friends tell me I better leave ya
I tell them to get some better cheaper
Yeah we gon' make it pop ma
But you shaking your ass in the club gotta stop ma
Get my â??Nac, get my Dutch
When I'm falling I need you to be my crutch
And we can just take it from there
Now see if the love can overpower all the hate in the air

One thing she should know
I don't ever want to let her go
But if she keeps on with the movements
She gon' make me lose it
And I hope that she can see
That I'm down for her, but is she down for me
Whenever in need
I make sure she eats
She can always count on me (yeah)

Beat Novocaine, AKA Mr. Miami, AKA get the fuckin job done

Yeah,
When I cop it's 4 doors I'm too big for a coupe nigga
And when I go to war I don't get shot I just shoot niggas
And I don't trust a nigga far as I could saw him
Even though I'm feeling strong enough or probably can roof niggas
Yeah, ya boy back in the booth nigga
I'm off the weed but I'm back on my juice nigga
I beat the case so it's off the pursuits
Back in fatigues, black tees and Timberland boots nigga
The year is new I want my spot back
Take 2, matter fact take the whole clip
Who you know could fly by '05 then '06
When they see that new V the dope boys go crazy
Yeah, You know I still fuck with State P
Still fuck with Dame Dash still fuck with Jay-Z
Still, real still recognize real
I still feel it in the air we still kill at will

[Chorus]
Now first Pac got caught
Then Big clock stop
Now something going on with the Roc
I'm hearing shit about a breakup
The shit people make up
I'm like damn, when will it stop
Jay and Dame ain't speaking
Game and 50 Cent beefing
Then Cease got Lil' Kim knocked
I'm hearing all this from the jail
While I'm sitting in my cell
And I'm waiting on some mail from the prof

Uh, Yo
You got a hole in you and you bleeding
So it's not like I'm just calling you pussy for no reason
Me I'm a bastard I hit the blunts 'til I gotta cough then I pass 'em
Exhaust on the Aston
That next choice you make might be your last one
Shit that I needed stuck with me from the classroom
Real talk now, who's the king of New York now
And boys got safes in the house I got a vault now
From my old grams, still with my old fams
Still getting wireless head that's with no hands
Listen, my grandma in composition
Compared to y'all is way beyond existence
D-Block daddy, new black Caddy
Coming through knocking Michael McDonald and Patty
P's a haze and still going for 8 in a natty
Rather have God arrest me than Satan embag me
Get serious I gladly involve your moms
Alkeida, Jada, I'm only involved with bombs, uh
Put my life on it
Soon as you sit it in the hot water all you gotta do is put the ice on it
I've been giving it to niggas for years
I'm responsible for niggas careers, mother fucker

[Chorus]

Hold your head up Cass don't stress, weight'll come off fast
Keep to yourself, Just try not to come off ass
Cause these niggas ain't playing fair
You know stay on your square, handle the biz

Hey, living in the fast lane
Driving fast 'broads'
With them fast 'chains'
When you pimping through life
See some people get caught up
And some charges brought up
With some people they shoot up
Hey, there it goes again
Different face to the same old tragic end
Who's to blame if he never saw it coming
Yet he heard the bullet humming
And he never though of running
It's too late for him now laying out on the ground so cold, so cold
Nothing much to live up to, damn
It's so far gone, so gone

Living in the fast lane
Driving fast broads
With you fast chains
When you pimping through life
See some people got caught up
With some charges brought up
From some people they shoot up
Hey.. tell me when will it end
When the baby pays for its mothers sinning
Trapped inside the four walls of a 'penty'
Way too strong, way too strong
Now she's out in the cold, dying slow and the spoon still warm

[Jadakiss]
It started when they birthed me
Running round stuck in the project now he can't wait to the first come
Little older now and can't wait till the dope come
Sleep all these years and nobody awoke him
Getting it so he can cover the whole border
Question is how many of us can hold water
It seemed like telling is in 
Signed states get an order of protection and tell him again
I'm a left lane
My life is much faster than yours
I'm with a chick and its attached to a brawl
Got the air ones matching the car
All white, slinging all night
So we rapidly spar
That's what they want to clap at me for
Understand that the flow is like the coke that he naturally grows
So I'ma get my cash on, and my mash on
And get my ass up out of the fast lane

Why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game

Took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone
Me and my niggas is so close, it's complicated

One nigga smokin' and drinkin' and yet we all faded
My nigga Edi had a son we all happy
'Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My niggas cry, we all cry, and all ride

To rectify the problem, motherfuckers they all die
Been tryin' to make a million, by hustlin' since my adolescence
From crack dealin' to rap villain, my new profession
Who wanna see me at eight deep, fuck 3D
You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me

Bustin' with automatic straps
My raw raps like good crack

Come around without cops shits on you gon' get touched quick (you get touched)
'cause I was at the vibe when it jumped off, put 50 grand up
You pussy you ain't even lift a hand up (you didn't do shit)
Ya man stabbed somethin', police grabbed somethin'
But besides that I ain't see nobody man up?
Shit what the plot is about? (what?)
'cause you know that you don't need a dentist to get shot in the mouth (uh uh)
And the hood hate ya shit but you hot in the south
It's the crackas that buy the album what's the plottin' about? (whats it about)
Many men make a wish but we ain't many men (uh uh)
So you gon' get death when we let them semis spit (what?)

Jadakiss,"You know
I never did understand why they always told me to smile
Shit
It ain't too much shit I gave a smile for
Real talk
Yo still a asshole by nature
Peep game

I remember comin' up able to love nigga watchin' niggas fuck over 
They over sea I kept it reala
But bein' real ain't really always what niggas make it to be 
I never thought we'd make it and I'd have niggas hatin' a G
I got enough shit that I deal with on the day to day
Penitentiary's the life after death don't seem to go away
Even though I never know the outcomes it's always safe to pray
And try to do my best to understand he write a rhyme away
I got a call from Mr. Rogers just the other day tellin' me he by my side
I'm like what the fuck you talkin' 'bout 'til he told me Lorna died
It f***ed me up so much I couldn't even go to the wake
But if her family called I'm gon' make sure that they straight
It's like this part of my life I live is damn near mastered
The more people I love the more they get took away faster
Sometimes I feel I talk to God a lil more than the pastor
Prob'ly been livin' to make sure my son never become a bastard
I've never been the one to quit I've always been the leader
But I feel this world is like a bitch and I know I don't need her
If I ever had this I never took the time to meet her
So I feel a frown across my face the only way to greet her
In the process of bein' Trae I missed out as a child
Prob'ly 'cause reality must stop
And they told my cousin death before he thirty after checkin' his pile
He died at 28 so how the fuck am I supposed to smile shit

I don't know my nigga
I ask myself the same shit everyday
How the fuck am I supposed to smile
Life's real over here though
Ya know

Styles don't smile 
The hood too foul
The lil' niggas is wild
Men lost trial
Hit 'em with some numbers he ain't eatin' doin' chow
He ain't even sleepin' he been thinkin' 'bout his child
It's real fucked up but he won't see him for a while
Same bullshit try'na get you a money pile
You don't see the reefer or the jail doors locked
I keep a tech with the air holes cocked
Now I don't wanna shoot or get shot
But Pinero's not
Gon' fuck with these fuck niggas or air those Lox
It's real hard to sleep when its money on the mind and
Murder on the mind 
Puffin' on the dutch with a fist full of iron
Somebody mom cryin' 'cause somebody boy dyin' 
It's the same ol' shit
Wait till the funeral
Same ol' trip 
Crack money rap money
The same ol' grip
As Trae could've smiled out in Texas
Livin' reckless
If the cops gon' get you but niggas 'll leave you breathless
shit I'm a winner
More like a sinner
Try'na make it to dinner
Then live after breakfast
Ya know

Trae 
S.P.
How the fuck are we suppose to smile
Man
Answer me that
Maybe I'll fuckin' smile 
Why'know

Nothin' to smile about
These lil' niggas is wildin' out
Do somethin' to 'em they dialin' out
Everybody lookin' at you like you foulin' out
Every hood everywhere that's what it's now about
The shootas is half your age
Give you half the gage
Daily news half the page
Known as a thug now he ain't just fly
Couple months in the group home in D-F-Y
Truthfully what could have been pended but never did
And he slid
As a youthful offender 'cause he's a kid
Problem is
The person he shot was connected
He comin' home thinkin' he's sweet and don't expect it
Big but he's still young
To him it's still fun
360 waves new gear blue steel gun
They say you ain't promised tomorrow
They got the drop and hit him right in his head with a hollow",Smile,2007

I represent the ghetto

All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars

Holler this because

Ayo Cali
Walk with me
Yeah that's what got me here
The chucks the khaki suits
All the swap meet years
The six dollar socks the five dollar rocks
Uncle Greg rest in peace he taught me how to chop
That's why I love the hood and everything we got
From the ice cream trucks to the forty ounce tops
All white Air Force Ones to fake Jacob watch
A few reasons why I drive the Bentley hard top
Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block
Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch
I'm that type of nigga y'all made my city bigger dog
Turn the TV off got tired of watchin' Jigga boss
So we told our mom's we was lookin' for jobs
When we was really in the record store lookin' for Nas
Project of the ghetto, Ghetto and the project
From Compton to being Dre's number one prospect so

Yeah ugh
They know
Yeah ugh

Ain't no help there just food stamps
Weight checks and welfare
Every man gone for self there
Still might need to borrow your medicade card for health care
Yeah if you never got knocked then you made it
Everybody know each other if not they related
You can get shot or get bladed
There's dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the eighties
Six months five years for you just to cop out
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out
Fights break out when you wired and start joking
A lot of OG's retired and started smokin'
House party games of spade sweet kool-aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid

Haha
Tell me this how come
Black folks get a little doe
And forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up you ain't cool with us
We still support you tho we don't see you much
You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives few kids scattered here
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared
The ghetto will still be here

I think it's me and you tonight ma
You see every good woman needs a thug, you see every good woman needs a thug

[Jadakiss]
Go baby, you so wavy
And I ain't never felt this way 'bout no lady
Considering going half with you on yo' baby
Something about you, making me go crazy
Know if I ain't soured up, I'm so hazy
Me and you on the same page, so amazing
Need your love girl, so many ways
And you could only hold in out for so many days
And, got enough points to score but you shaving
Hell yeah I'm anxious, but you craving
Time keep flying, I'ma keep trying
Bottom line, I need your L-O-V-I-N
Come on!

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Yeah I made no mistake, right by my side
Lil' mama that's your place, keep holding me down
And you can help me spend this cake, right by my side
Ride with me, all I need is you right by my side

[Jadakiss]
He such a small fella, to recognize the Mason Martin Margiela
What could I tell her
Man I swear you got to see her to believe her
Then maybe you could understand why I need her
Besides her being a diva she wasn't bothered by the chiba
Zodiac sign was a libra
Definitely a keeper, I just wanna put her in a sleeper then fall out underneath her
Wake up, take a shower, then get deeper
Juice up get some power and then freak her
After the feedback then I could G Mack
But it's something about her love making me need that, come on!

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
When the drama comes my way (Way)
Long as I GOT YOU, girl it's nothing
Baby, it's nothing - I'm good
When these streets, girl, come what may (what may)
Shorty, we do what WE DO, so it's nothing
Baby girl, your love is something I need

[Jadakiss]
Yo, they say every good woman needs a thug
I totally agree, that's why I need your love (yep)
And I can't help it, if I'm selfish
Cause I need your love and nobody else's
Starting to taste it, pardon the bracelet (padon)
Chance of a lifetime and I can't waste it
If being beautiful was a test, should've aced it
Her skin is flawless, her hair is wavelengths
Hi I'm Jason, ma I'm patient-ly waitin for us to have relations
Kissing me is just history in the makin
Squeezing and hugging I need your loving, come on!

Jadakiss,"Oh Ah ha!

Yo things was all fine when the sun was shining
But when the rain came that's when the pain came
Sittin' up in the Range
She feels some kinda way
She doing strange things
But I ain't with the games
Just keep it a secret yo
It's cheaper to keep her bro
Two wrongs don't make us right
But we equal though
It's getting better though
And I can't sweat her
And I love her
But I can't let her know
I can't let her go

Have you ever been in love?
Well well well
Have you ever been in love?
Well well well

She was 5 foot 4 from the floor
Prettiest little thing I've seen before
Her body was so tight, had her hair done right
But who's shorty with tonight
I got that big boy sitting outside
All I need to know if she'd mind if I took her for a ride
I couldn't wait to meet her
On that first date to treat her
I just wanna please her

So we jumped up in the Range (jumped up in the Range)
Shorty started acting strange (so strange)
Her attitude began to change
As it began to rain (began to rain)
Shorty started to complain (oh yeah)
About every single thing

[Chorus]
Every time I think about her
I can't make up my mind 
Well it's hard to explain
Just the way I feel about her
Well I'll tell you what I know
Brown sugar love me real slow
And I don't care what my friends say
I just can't let her go

Two years gone by, I
Trying to find the reasons why, I
I always seem to make you cry, I
Just don't know why
Well could it be
You always running in the streets
Come home from work, ain't nothing to eat
You stretched your little dough running home for more
Then you're straight back out the door
Somebody tell me, baby

Even though we fuss and fight
Cussing all through the night
She's in my arms all the morning light
We wake up and make up
Even though she gets on my nerves
She take shit that she don't deserve
Tell me what's a woman like that worth

[Chorus]

Now I finally realized
You're like heaven in my eyes
I took a long time, I apologize
Even though at times you messed up
Shaking your ass up in the club, that's messed up
But you're quick to hit the block when the crib get hot
When my dough get low, you be holding me up
But I'm still out here chasing
Out here baby making
What a brother gotta do

Money is nothing
Whatever Kiss wants is gon' get purchased
House so high in the Hills, phones don't get service
Just listen, even though we be riffing
Without you around, I think things would be different
And not for the better neither
My friends tell me I better leave ya
I tell them to get some better cheaper
Yeah we gon' make it pop ma
But you shaking your ass in the club gotta stop ma
Get my â??Nac, get my Dutch
When I'm falling I need you to be my crutch
And we can just take it from there
Now see if the love can overpower all the hate in the air

One thing she should know
I don't ever want to let her go
But if she keeps on with the movements
She gon' make me lose it
And I hope that she can see
That I'm down for her, but is she down for me
Whenever in need
I make sure she eats
She can always count on me (yeah)

Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me and shit
Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop
Curse, swerve to get served, these cocksuckers got nerve
Heard I was killin' shit, they must got word
That I told the chief on Rich Port I don't wanna merge

I skated through the back of the building, hit the steps up
Ran up in Kay crib, lay daddy rest
I had to break free, police on me and they F-B's
Yelling ""I think his name Lex, that's his aunt, freeze""
That's when I hit the window, indo' coming out the back room
Boom, Pretty and his man, Black Caesar
Damn, they saw me and they bustin' at me
Cab just missed me, plus them goochie frames, foul, that's six fifty
Stop back at suite, them leaf defense slid through my man garden
Yelled out 'pardon', kept it moving, peace
Build be gone, ain't no honor amongst thieves
Please, plus they heard I'm getting Parmesan cheese
And I won't stop moving til the metal dig me
Say word, yo, make 'em work for it, young rookie, y'all need me
That's when it is, what it is, if it's that or the cup
But in the ill gangstas book what they niggas do is

[Chorus]
Run! If you sell drugs in the school zone
Run! If you gettin' chased with no shoes on
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got, guns!
They givin' out life like by the tons
Run! If you ain't do shit, you it
That next felony, nigga, it's like three zip
So, run! Hop fences, jump over benches!
When you see me comin' get the fuck out the entrance!
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got guns!

Ah-hah! I might gotta take my shirt off (yeah, kid)
I like that one (uh-huh, go in, go in!)

Yo, uh, it's Task Force Tuesday, the NARCS is in the black car
I got five hundred, hundred packs in my backyard
Clear twelve-twelve's, that look like stuff shells
I'm cuttin' niggas throats on the sails, while they puff L's
Don't leave nothin' unbagged, shave everything
I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything (to save everything)
They come by one more time, they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she gettin' knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dippin' with that
Uh, down-shiftin' on 'em like I got gears on me
(Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me
(Run!) Scared to death, runnin' like I got bears on me
(Run!) My Timb's start feelin' like they Nike Air's on me
(Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the throughway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm try'nna hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at
And I'm asthmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
'Magine if I would of let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do

Free hold east coast whole, boxing the Philly down
Down to Dela', when y'all rarely toting the milli round
I bring the milli to ya house, I was just down south
Carolina had the milli down there
Pearl Beach had the heater in reach, and four freaks
In Hooters, I made 'em lose it when they heard freedom of speech
Told them freaks that I gotta run, I'm on the run
But they tried to make me stay, they showed me two hooters a piece
I stayed for a second but you know I gotta skate
It's like a race, cops chase me, I'm chasing the moon
Before I left the premise, saw two more bitches
They told me they was witches, told me hop on they broom
I did, and then we went zoom
Don't you know them witches got me outtie wit the quickness
I'm buggin', I'm trippin' in reality I'm skitzin'
The cops got me trapped in the Audi wit the Smith and

[Chorus]

D-Boy, yeah, Birdman Jr. in ya building, people
I'm a let you know how it go on my side of the mountain, whoadie

It's sure about does that you heard me
And I dropped in effect since 9/11
I'm on the avenue with nines, elevens, I'm a two times felon
That's why I keep the top up, on my 9-11
Pele, in New Orleans, ain't got no Rico law
So I keep that heat in the car, but they don't know
I had that 'dro in the seat of the car
But it's hot right now, so you can see me tomorrow
Ay, Ghostface, the youngins on the block duckin' blue and red lights
While your boy bypassing fare light
But if them cock suckers ever get me dead right
Three hots and the cops swallow weed and a knife, right?
I speed at night, take it easy in the day
Go hard wit the dough, take it easy wit the yae
Yup, Lil' Weezy, I get my loot up
But at the pull up, come, I say my crew run run, boy

I'm going hard till I get her
Cause my mission won't be complete till I'm with her.
Even though right now she acting kinda bitter
But I'm thinking in a minute she will reconsider
Especially if she understands how I dig her
Yea I think big but I plan even bigger
Walking in the sands holding hands by the river
Good love make her legs shake then she shiver
Being all that she needs is my soul purpose.
If she don't feel the same way though it's all worthless
Everybody makes mistakes so we ain't perfect
It's not cause I want this to happen I deserve it
Peeped your whole style out and I observe it
I see you ain't making this easy I gotta earn it
But I gotta make this official tho I can't be the man I wanna be till I'm with you though.

I'm an impecable lyricist
And with the right mechanics, I could take over be clear of this
They well aware of Kiss the light of the city

The clip is loaded, the quatro is on cruise
I'm back to work bitch, the clock off snooze
I'm tougher than leather nigga I cannot bruise
Who wanna try a nigga?
Hard to the God, come and butterfly a nigga (hold that!)
Ooze on out (uh-huh)
Weeks later bitch go and throw your shoes on out
I'm that shit that great Mario {?} 'bout
Clear this out, blood on the hopscotch floor
Shells in the sandbox; niggaz with big glocks
Late night, movin' that junk, like Redd Foxx
Now, you don't want nothin' about me (nah)
You pussy, nigga come fuck with the alkie
Weed smokin', keep the cancer piece on it (yeah!)
Call hoes, get pussy whenever I want it (c'mere bitch)
Mack daddy (no) pimp daddy (no)
Hammer cocked (yeah) let that, go
I ain't heard shit in a long long time
To even fuck around with either one of my rhymes (Sheek Louch!)
Niggaz still livin' off the petty-ass crimes
The Hossa{?} hater, Lacoste gator
Levi's, hundred to the Mr. Chow waiter
Whattup street niggaz? Hold heat niggaz
Fuck sweet niggaz, you'll get beat niggaz (yeah!)

[Chorus]
Now who out there wanna fuck around with me?
You can come and get a fresh buck-fifty
We got guns, money, liquor, drugs
We right here until they come get me (I'm talkin' 'bout murder)
Now who out there wanna fuck around with me?
You can come and get a fresh buck-fifty
We got guns, money, liquor, drugs

C'mon, yeah, ah-hah! Nobody, c'mon
Yeah, c'mon, yeah, c'mon, yeah, yeah, uhh, yo

Yo listen here, you ain't dead if your heart ain't stop
Twin forty's, you ain't gotta ask ""Are they cocked?""
I'm so sharp I could come through and scar they block
Late night, red linin' in an R.A. drop
And I'm only tuckin' them until I shoot ya
When I pull 'em out that's when I'm fuckin' with your future
You gon' realize this is nothin' that you're used to
Get your life tooken by a booster, then we gon' hang the noose up
It's all over with (yeah)
All they found was his Louis scarf with his DNA all over it (mm)
Who's choosin' and pickin' them (who?)
Cause I'm sick of them, not followin' the curriculum (yeah)
It's my shit and I'm evictin' them (get out)
Whoever feel like they ain't gotta leave, I'm rippin' them
Even though the love's frail the thug's real
All you gotta do is just follow the blood trail
Much harder fightin' when the battle is uphill
Whatever the knife can't handle the slug will
Keep a good lawyer that's smart work on cases
Still gotta run from the NARCs, they gon' chase us (run)
In case I gotta put some artwork on faces
If we leave the game for God they gon' 'Mase' us
My suggestion, is that you don't even test son
Unless you wanna catch a fresh one

They must got a death wish
They was on the road to the riches back in the day they got off on the exit
Trill disrespect shit
Whenever a nigga try to fuck up your investment
It's hard to digest it
Young niggas don't want to get punched in they faces
So they keep the burner on, to catch a bunch of cases
These old niggas still think they livin' in the '80s
The shawties they knew since they were babies turn crazy
The bitches still holla at anybody
Lookin' like they have a couple dollars
Fuck suck and swallow
Ain't nobody winnin' but everybody can't lose
Dirts still there funeral home ain't move
Going in coming out gang affiliated
Rather go back before being humiliated
A black cloud over the hood you can't escape it
Dust smokin' niggas walk around in the matrix
Loyalty is thin, tension is thick
Look at a broke nigga's face when you mention a brick
Stick up kids come around, when they sense that you rich
Cans of lizzle get lit, when you get hit with a fifth
Niggas they used to hoop dreamin' is now sellin' the piff
And they still rattin' but you can't tell if you stiff
Especially when the tek spit, fuck around get your head and your neck hit
Lookin' for a death wish, walk

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Talkin' out your mouth
All wreckless to a nigga that you know
That'll let it off
That's a death wish
When your heart stops and your body gets breathless
And help don't come in enough time
That's a death wish
When you see the blood, realize that your chest is hit
And don't know where it came from
That's a death wish
When you know a nigga whole style's on select shit
(young money)when you violate 'em, fwah
That's a death wish

[Lil Wayne]
On that way left shit
Better get right or get left shit
Better hit right or get left, hit
Even if you threw the best pitch
Yes bitch
It's Weezy F. Bitch
I'm the best, bitch
Motherfuck your guest list
I'll be like let's just kill 'em
And get breakfast
Neck slit, next shit expect this
Every time you check this
I'm exit I mean excited to be your death wish
Bitch I wear this G-shit on my heart not my necklace
And I keep the hypno' for the hecklers
And I'm from the mecca of the wreckless
With a record-breaking debt list
The wreckers and neglectors think all that shit won't affect us
I'm high above you above law above average
Niggas snitching putting niggas in the can like a beverage
Damn
I pop out your head fuck up your memories
I'll put a bullet in Nina head and let her reminisce
Yea
You still don't remember shit
You gon' remember this
I'm knockin' niggas down this year
I'm on my timber shit
Big lion growl at you niggas on that simba shit
I be on that fuck yo clique I kill every member shit
Cool as December shit
Bang in any weather shit
And they can buy your bag but the parts sold separate
Yea that's a bad bitch

Grinding day and night so we can kick off our shoes
And live a glamorous life look what we made it to

If we ain't breaking them down
Then we letting them fly
Nah never I, always we
I came in the game dividing the pies by three
Then we got famish
So we set standards
Very similar to the ten crack commandments
Some couldn't take it
Others got lost and couldn't make it
He wanted to floss but couldn't fake it
The hood embraced it
The rest is basics
No need to rush be extra patient
The new 4 door Porsche is extra spacious
Same entourage no extra faces
Hands down the best no explanations
And to the top is the next destination
There ain't no time outs
Death is the only time we goin' sign out
So we goin' grind out

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Top 5 dead or alive what they consider them
Soon as them things come in we get rid of em
Mo money mo problems gotta live with em
Only thing they care about is what you giving them
Not the energy that you wasted in the game
Or the tears that tripled down your face from the pain
The time the jaw cracked you wasted the cane
Had to do two shifts to make it the same
That all changed soon as you tasted the fame
And it was all worth it after you made you a name
Thanks to our heavily father
We fly on the jet now instead of the charter
Leave a nice tip in the front for the gardener
Do all of listening so we stay smarter
Everybody's a hero when they get scarred up
Its my ball check it up y'all better guard up

[Chorus]

When we step up out of our car the whole damn world is looking at us
Cause they knew us from before, now we ain't hurting no more
You can bring me the bill I will sign my name
Now we're flying private planes and such looking like a million bucks
You can't tell me nothing!

Shit ain't going right I try to see the light. I try
Oh, it's like my eyes got a cover on em and something holding me back
A better man better level better know I try

[Jadakiss]
Yeah yo, Listen I done played with the snakes in the grass
Paid for my mistakes I made in the past
Everybody ate when I came wit the cash
At least I tried to ride the wave till it crashed
Same wood on the gun handle is on the dash
All the hoods that son ran through is on smash
They can't identify you wit a mask
And the bible I'll tell you nothing is gonna last
The name of the game's survival
If you make it alive when you ride through they make it arrival
My boo is gon' ride you know I am gon' ride too
Make an M every day I am gon' try to
Let's go

[Jadakiss]
Yeah yo, I tried to tell niggas I am willing to blast for it
I only try to give it to niggas that ask for it
Got them things on the scale I am still weighing em
Thought my dues was paid I am still paying em
Couple Elanor's and the Goose I am still baying em
Semi's and the fulli's know that the truth stay wit em
Wolves and gorillas is loose so don't play with em
Something's holding em back there's nothing that you can say to em
Popped champagne wit biggie at the palladium
Put that good hawk work in with the titanium's
Shit switch around when them heats get fired
And ya peeps just died but I least he tried Let's go

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Yeah, 
Watch the game get taken over
I am still on the same side of the fence I am just looking over
A solider from the gravel to the grass
To the obstacles in life I travel in the past
Whether I am holding a mic or holding a mac
It's like an invisible force is holding me back
But I ain't letting go of my pride
After I get the dough I slide
Better know I tried, let's go

Here come another day up on me
Put the pressure on me here we go again ah

Now I got a clip full of hollows in the.40
Louis, Guccis, every now and then Mauris
I take too long to come back, send for me
Know how to work it, big things pop on the underground circuit
Maintain 'til it surface
The nerve of these peasants
Treat a rap budget like a bird how I stretch it
Think they get the message
Waters, Dutchies, lot of herb in a session
So-called tough guys, herbs with aggression
Put your thoughts all over the curb with the Wesson
What used to be superb now is depressing
Negative energy
Generated from the snakes and the centipedes
You will remember me
I just get the storm started
Cold-blooded, warm-hearted
Either way you on target
Move to the side, let the lane merge
The gun's like fried rice, who want they brain stirred?
Enter the limelight, lemon drop-top off of crime life
Always see the crew in the hindsight
Yeah!
American sedan, the shooters got Berettas in their hand
This is Mafia, veterans'll plan
Word to the tape on the brick, this is raw
I'm in the 4x4, 8 plus 8 in the clip
The hustling Harry Potter, shaking the brick
Ice in the bracelet give the Matrix a glitch
And my car's like a spaceship
Got gold in my Nike checks
Jordans got ice in the laces
Pants got a gun where the waist is
It's basic, shirt smell like herb smoke

Let me know who getting murked, though
Yeah, we getting money, nigga
Who getting work, though

Kill you or hurt you, whatever's a virtue
Beat you like ya parents when you breaking your curfew

We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
Get this money, it don't matter if it's cash or check
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
Big houses, cars and jewels that's wet
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
To the family, friends, whole life is set
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step, one more step

Yo, living my life, what's left of it
Don't try to go to jail but if you do make the best of it
If you crash into a bullet then it ain't no estimate
It's a money-back guarantee, my nigga
Death's a definite
This is audio crack, guess who's cheffing it
Jadakiss and SP, do this effortless
Gun play make you do whatever son say
If the Lord send you a flight, the ticket is one-way
Put that work in when you young, you get power
The money don't match the running it get sour
Still rep the hood to the death
A promise is only good if it's kept
Niggas'll kill you for less
Silence is golden, go 'head, keep dozing
The window of opportunity keeps closing

A cell is small, but a casket is much smaller
Burn out 30 a set shit, 60 a Key shit

Montclair, D-Squared, Emilio Pucci
Long trips, short trips, making me nauseous

Made a couple mil for the small shit
We rap and keep raw, so we on some street lore-Forbes shit
Wall still spin, upgraded the floor flip
Ain't touch it, ain't see it, ain't hear about it
If it's money gone, believe we gon' care about
Send some niggas to your crib, take the air up out it
Leave some blood up in it
Listen, fam, the Lam's the color of toast

No hammers in the club, box cutter in it

The more she held in the pain,
It kept coming,
Eventually it scarred her for life as a woman,

(Talk that shit, talk that shit, Jada talk that shit, oh!)

You could tell the way I stack my money (I'm something else!)
Nah, I ain't one of them dummies (I'm something else!)
Tre's, nick's, dimes and twenties (I'm something else!)
The way I get it in with the honeys (I'm something else!)

[Jadakiss]
Yo, you know I love to style on ya, blue 40-caliber
Butterfly doors on the triple black challenger
And I'm still in and out, got it so I'm spendin out
Dope boy, so I never have a problem in a drought
Don't take, too much work if you can't manage that
Just in case you run out of empties, use sandwich bags
Play with the hand you was dealt
That's why I ride the track 'til it melt
I could care less how you feel, how you felt
I done spent niggas rent money on belts
Threesomes in the trunk, I'm fucking for the wealth
And the hood ask about me, I'm something else

Still representing the block (I'm something else!)
And you ain't got to tell me I'm hot (I'm something else!)

I ain't even did nothing, feeling like I'm trafficking
See these blood diamonds, sir, my chain African
Speaking of my chain, yeah it need to get a job
Get the fuck up off my neck, Senator Barack
Whatever that you do, look, don't get caught
That stash get low, ya ass might get bought
Okay I'm over it, let's talk about something else
I said I'm over it, I think I bought something else
That's why I live e'ry day (day) like a thug holiday
""Suffocate"" a nigga about mines, J. Holiday
Quick to make a movie 'bout my Doc Holiday
It's why I'm strapped 365, even holidays, yeah!

[Chorus]

[AP]
Yeah, I'm something else with myself they say
WWF, push that featherweight
Big boy toys, of course the shoe's right
See the 22's reflect from the moonlight?
Barry White, or Walter Cronkite?
Couple cold words when you talk 'bout birds
You ain't talking 'bout green, you ain't talkin 'bout me
Hold up, this your bitch on my caller ID

[Blood Raw]
You could tell I'm something else, pussy nigga do the math
Just look at me nigga; you can't tell I got cash?
Got together so fruity, 26 inches
(Girl, ain't that Blood Raw?) You can't tell I got bitches?
I'm a three summer soul survivor
Tell me have you ever met a nigga that's real as the bible?
You could tell I'm addicted to paper
And if it ain't my clique I'm like Maino, fuck you haters!

[Chorus]

[Boo Rossini]
Yo, hey yo
Any situation involving paper I'm all in
Pull up on your block, old school sitting on all rims
Still keep them semis on deck in case I'm tested
And gotta do a nigga dirty, turn him to a mess quick
Chest all hanging out, everybody screaming out
I grew up in a house, where damn near everybody fiending
So don't ask, why I hold me the pen on my fucking self
If I pop through and you come back I'ma hit you with something else

[Snyp Life]
I'm something else the way I come off, bars that make 'em run off
Rippin up his back but the strap'll tear your front off
Neck slump and run through your boss, he tried to jump off
It's D-Block, we treat every town just like it's New York (D-Block!)
Cross the whole game like my verses do the track
Push the pen like a pack and let it work through the trap (Snyp!)
Get your roof cut, ace hit by shooter's that'll spray shit
And if it ain't the ruger shit'll melt you and your face split

[ Bully]
Okay, Bully bitch!
Uh, I'm something else, run through niggas like Phelps
D-Block's next generation explains itself (D-Block!)
You don't wanna FUCK with Bully the don-dada
Name ring bells in the hood, a known shotter
You gets nada when it comes to my ricotta
Fresh Levi's, black V-necks and Pradas
I'm a problem for niggas if nothing else
Control, substitute or police, I'm something else

Jadakiss,"I just want to Thank y'all for taking the time to listen
I appreciate that

Yo regular TV to cable from bouncing label to label
Just trying to get the horse out the stable
Was once part of a dynasty, well least I was trying to be
Think it was the time when I was finding me
Sitting in the spot with the dimes willing to do anything to be a bad boy at the time
Then I rolled the dices nah the money didn't add up 
But just that whole experience it was priceless
No free rides to the bank on top of that was the untimely demise of Frank (BI)
Then the No Way Out Tour we was smoking outdoor spent 80 stacks on C LO that without tour
Videotape it all I still watch it, now travel the world learn how to rock a crowd
It ain't much but it beats poor Things that I been through is all I can speak for

[Chorus: Luther]
I can only speak for the things that I been through
I can only speak for the things that I been through

Now I'm on Ruff Ryder Interscope same shit Partnership Joint Venture 50/50 same split
Jimmy put the money up two singles off of we are the streets 
Then after that seem like he was done with us but it wasn't over yet
Styles had a plan from the jump which was to come out with my solo next
Things a little better these the niggas that I been doing it with forever so I'm like whatever
First album dropped promotion was hella Every stage I rocked performance was stella
Had the whole world ready to ride or die for me and I wasn't platinum I was just side money
X was bringing the mulla I was in the hood in the kitchen with the digital ruler
I can't tell bout the evil me do, I can only speak for the things that I been through

[Chorus: Luther]
I can only speak for the things that I been through
I can only speak for the things that I been through

As far as the LOX we all fine cellar is all wine
Selfish for me to say Roc Fella is all mine cause it ain't
I'm just a another employee that's on line trying to get my act together and do it one more time
Twenty-one gunz salute with all nines and I know it's on me to make sure we all shine (Gotta)
Fall Back let the weed contact your mind, 
Confined all bull shit in any contract you sign
If you from the streets though it's plenty of loop holes to eat
Yo once they let you in your suppose to keep doe
But I can't give you the formula I'm on it though
Expect the worst the outcome is enormous though stay humble 
Still keep your heat for insurance though
Things that I been through to get it weren't normal yo
Yeah This is what my heart beats for
Things that I been through is all that I can speak for

Take a second, what if we could rewind the hood?
Better yet, what if the L.O.X. would of signed with Suge?
What if Puffy never signed us?
What if Oprah made them comments
Like Imus?
What if you designed this
Thought like I did?
Said it like this:
What if Peyton was fighting dogs instead of Mike Vick?
What if Arnold would just let Tookie get life?
What if B.I.G. missed the party, what if 'Pac missed the fight?
What if you was caged in?
What would you change then?
What if there was no Rocafella law for +Made Men+?
What if hate ran through me?
And what if Portland
Would've drafted Jordan
Instead of Sam Bowie?
What if you really have to be nice to get a deal?
What if all of these rappers' ice was really real?
What if I hit you with the razor from cheek to chin?
What if Mike Jackson never would have bleached his skin?

[Chorus: x2]

What if you never been places you needed to go?
What if you get there, and learned them as you go?

What if the pain went away?
What if you changed in a day?
What if you can eliminate

What if Shyne beat the case?
What if Diddy did a dime flat?
What if Nelson Mandela could give his time back?
What if Malcolm was silent?
What if Martin was violent?
What if you could really ""sneak an uzi on the island""?
Yeah
What if I made you kiss the niner?
What if a brick was only just a misdemeanor?
What if Manhattan was hit by Hurricane Katrina?
What if a black man was the one controlling Fema?
What if we ain't never let emotions come between us?
What if the last time we rode, someone seen us?
What if

I flow calm
But don't push
What if Saddam
Hung Bush?
What if ""One Mic"" was called ""One Hook""?
What if the Bridge never showed me how to hold a weapon?
What if I ran into that sick chick with no protection?
What if I never wore that army jacket?
Carhard to match it
Unlaced tims, the hood on my first album cover under plastic?
What if I was just another corny rapper?
What if I went first instead of Notorious, who would tell my story after?
What if we loved less and lust more?
If Obama was on Mount Rushmore?
Would Ali give Tyson a busted jaw?
What if I never glared out the project window?
Whenever the the scared for me and the life of my kinfolk?
What if that gun pin broke?
I would have never learned back in the body of an Enzo

What if all real niggas was all dead
What if Hilary and them
Were reptilian?

I put a hurting on, I got the curtains drawn
Whoever ain't getting shitted on, I'm squirting on
I'm in the six-deuce, fifty-sevens for the health
Chopper in the trunk, .45 for the belt
Bunch of wax dummies, all you guys gonna melt
Live for your kids, die for yourself
Bottles in the sky if you ride for the wealth
Peas on the block, pies on the shelf
If I ain't in the back of the 'Bach, I ain't in nothing else
Haha, I'm something else

Everybody knows how the story goes
Money and the clothes, they gon' come and go
But guess who stays the same? 
You gon' see the name

Cigar please
I came alive like a moth in the summer time
Japanese wheel blades all samurai
Shine brighter than them bitches on the other side
Time to make a blind motherfucker recognize
Ammunition got the competition nonexistent
Had to bubble crack but didn't have a pot to piss it
I'll double that, how dare you try to knock a nigga?
Street scholar, graduated no father figure
Still tote chrome, check my chromosomes
Meet me halfway with things and a mobile home
Money machines, yeah they ring like a mobile phone
I'm a seven-up, I need a coca-cola loan
I'm in the hood like I'm James Evans
Cashmere hand-made sweater
Me and money got a vendetta
Looking back, to tell the truth I could've did betta'

It's been too long and I can't do this baby (nah)
Said you're coming home but you've been gone too long (I'm sorry)
Its been too much (I know, I know) of the same thing baby (you right) 
I can't take no more, you been gone too long

It started off asking you to pray for me 
Now I'm on the phone begging you to wait for me
I've completed a lot of programs 
So when I see the Board now they should have a day for me
Hear it in your voice that you're getting tired 
When I ask do you Love me you getting quiet 
One day at a time I'm just getting by it
When the meter runs out time get expired

[Chorus]

This jail shit is corny, really startin' to bore me
And you gettin' fed up, on top of that you horny 
Knew that it would happen, cause u couldn't assure me 
Dealt with a nigga that did time way before me 
You ain't look happy to see me when you saw me 
You don't even write me back you just ignore me 
You don't even answer the jack you just record me 
Guess I been gone too long you can't support me 

[Chorus]

In the penitentiary my name ring 
When I come home it's the same thing 
Guess you gotta take what the game brings
Niggas change but a lot will remain wayne 
Thinking about it while I sit here 
Besides life ain't shit fair, I ain't heard from her this year
Guess I'll try to make it better when I get there 

[Chorus]

See I been holding you down for a minute
And its been like forever since we did it 
And the nights have been hell without You baby 
And everyday I feel like I'm going crazy 
Cause you told That this would be the last time 
But u said the same thing last time
And I promised myself that I'm through crying 
So I guess I'ma have to kiss you goodbye

Here 'cause I wanna be, not 'cause I have to be
You the one I wanna be with, ma actually
I knew you were special 'cause we hit it off naturally
Had your guards up at first, now you attached to me
Gotta give you all of me, can't give you half of me
Could take your time girl, we gon' move carefully
The hot bath water, the meals you prepare for me
When nobody else was, you were always there for me

My attitude is fuck it, house big as Publix
Shopping is a pleasure, pinky ring a nugget
Niggas like the ride, sip lean out the bucket
I lean to the side, white whip Michael Douglas 
Hard times, call for drastic measures
I call my dawg, he bought a Mac eleven
Forty rounds hollerin' ""where the ? at""
Nigga dead serious choppa with a shoulder strap
Microphone Micheal Corleone I know I'm wrong
The man up above love for me to sing them poems
So sing along, you know the song I sing
Bring them things along, I gotta feed the team
It's Rosay, I need a hundred bottles, 
Yellow bitches, all of 'em swallow
H town, nigga three o five
I can move them packs, each and every night

Triple black Panamera, Phantom of the streets
Quarterbackin' these bricks on top of these glass cleats
All these stones from my neck and wrist part of the streets
?
I'm in the hood under surveillance, buncha haters watchin'
Couple choppas out for dinner failin' ain't an option
Reclinable seats,  invisible ceilings
Competition is murder, haters I'm killing
Fuck a money machine, I don't count it I blow it
Bitch my money conceited, it look good when I trow it
I'm a asshole, therefore my temper is reckless
I'm the city of Houston, you can tell I miss Texas
The king of the streets, somewhere deep with gorillas
Behind something that's tinted, bitch you see the gorillas
These other niggas ?
And when I seem 'em let's fuck 'em minus the penetration

I'm gettin' situation, I know you bitches hate it
I'm in the new Aston, the one Swiss created
Can't give you a dime, but I can get you faded
Before you become a member, you get initiated
A lot of racks, big ice heavy weapon
The hood still love me cuz I never left 'em
I distributed, yeah, I get rid of it
It's all coming back, every bit of it
I'm territorial, it's your memorial
And don't feel bad, I'm talkin' to all of you
This is real shit, and that's nonsense
I got AK's, I got Thompson's
I got investors, I get sponsors

When they ask we don't play around
Load up, roll up, and then we lay 'em down

Keep the fast cake, keep a choppa' just to lay em down
If he try, give that lame a lullaby
Make him touch the sky, and  if he gotta we lay em down
Trust me, if I gotta spray the pound
I won't hesitate for one second, to lay 'em down

Another man down let me see you try to live through 'em
I had the whole town talking 'bout what you did to 'em
Funny how quickly they forget what I give to 'em
Life or dead situations I had us live through 'em
Still let the ? off
Couple more to pick off
When the drama is lit you can't cut the wick off
Streets taught him well, learnt it until it cost him
Reciprocated the hate and turned it into a fortune
Never woulda tried his hand, but they forced him
So right after they fried his man, then they off'ed him
Yeah you know the trees, the mink stop right below the knees
Four door shit from overseas
Underboss from the other side,
Blame me when you hear that they killed his whole mother's side
Never the money, always for the love of it
After you put 'em to bed, I sing 'em a lullaby
Mwah

Give that lame a lullaby, bed time story
You wouldn't die to do fed time for me
You gon' fuck around and make the headline story

Fuck ? get somethin' on the freeway, sucka free
Five less than twenty for the bird, nigga fuck wit me
Three less than six for the P, get it on the arm
Organic dope, cuz you can get it on the farm
I'm a Godfather, I'm a Don
My ? is my word, word is my ?
Can't be stopped in the first, or the fourth quarter
Work coming in on the dock, now that's a boss order
Big diamonds, clear like VOS water

At times I know life can seem miserable
But lil' bruh you got a lot of more living to do
You gotta go get it, they ain't gonna give it to you
Just watch what you say, and watch who you deliver it to
Put something away, cuz you'll never know when it rains
And you could never feel the love without knowing the pain
Bracelet and the pinky ring, go with the chain
These the different kind of jewels though, that go in your brain
Pray for your downfall, when you doing your thing
If something happens while you in charge then you was to blame
The less ? the better, stay fly get chedda'
Don't expect the V I or letter
When you get 'em never let up, when you fall get up
Wipe the tears off, get the blood and the sweat up
If you don't say nothing, can't be set up
Always stand tall, make sure you hold your head up

Hold your head lil' bruh (you don't stop)
You're not dead lil' bruh, no 
You are brown when this world is black and white lil' bruh

I know how it sounds lil' bruh
But you'll be alright lil' bruh

Aha, check me out
Yeah, ain't nobody gon' front you
There's money out here and you could get it if you want to
Or you can keep sitting around, saying what you're gonna do
If you don't pay attention, it's gonna come back to haunt you
Make saving one of your habits
Never keep the razors and plates under the cabinet
You can get further in life by using manners
Not only are these cellphones tapped they using scanners
Never use your own address, use your nana's
And if you ever have to pull it out, use your hammer
Yeah, white paper or dutch it
Ha, automatic or clutching
Once you put it away don't touch it
Let it come to you don't rush it
Accumulate more than enough shit
Then you get in the building and crush shit

Forget the ladies lil' bruh

Hand to hand in the cold

You just shut up and listen and you can complete the mission 
Know you want me to fall 
I don't do nothing but ball 
You heard I was in jail, but I just came from the mall 
I'm on my way to the jeweler bout to cop me a Muller 
Keep the digital ruler, at arms length of the Ruger 
Life's a bitch and I feel her 
Aint nobody iller, portico Godzilla

I'm just trying to carry my load another good nigga livin' by the bad guy code
Lookin' for the Lord but the devil spoke to you
When you lose a loved one or somebody that's close to you
People turning they back meaning the most to you
Then you find out your man is sending them folks to you
Maybe you shed a tear and you never cry
Always true to your word and you never lie
Got your hand on them birds you would let em fly
Yeah, cause real niggas never die (What?)

I had love for this music but ain't know how to pursue it,
Was frustrated as a teen I needed money for Buicks,
My shirt was stained from the sewage,
Niggas rockin' the newest,
I dealt with it for the moment but couldn't call it the future,
I'm down a block from the shootin',
It started to sound like recruitin',
Seein' niggas I grew up with sleep to funeral music,
And I was only fifteen,
I parted ways with my schoolin',
My first seven grams of work were like my holy communion and now I'm turnt out,
The block hot, niggas burnt out,
With no heart it's cold cash that we search out,
We got rules we hear shots then we 'sperse out,
Retaliation, get back exactly what the turf bout,
And it's a gang of young niggas I was hurt 'bout
On the real I almost shed tears in the church house
Back when I thought real niggas couldn't die
Learnt I was wrong but still couldn't cry

Somebody tell me why (why)
Why the good die young (why)
Sometimes it makes me cry (cry)
To know that you're gone 
Hold on to the memories
Not a day goes by I

'Cause real niggas never die (Real niggas never die)
They never die, no
Real niggas never die (Real niggas never die)
They never die
Real niggas never die

Since everybody real, where the fakers at?
Since everybody trill, where the flakers at?
Trynta break 'em down, where the tables at?
Dufflebag full of cash like, where Vegas at?
Crap tables, life's a gamble, but a nigga won!
Now I'm lookin' round like, what have a nigga done?
My lord my God, I'm used to hustlin' hard
Guess they find it odd how a nigga beat the odds
No Illuminati never been a fan of saints
That's what happens when you room big as central station
Same rubber band my cousin tied her braids with
We ain't cop the same car my auntie played spades with
What you know about five eatin' off a half
That's five mu'fuckas now you do the math
Oxymoron these rap niggas don't lie

All the chicks was erotic

All you needed was product
And somebody to test it
Find a good place to try it
Never keep nothin' on you
Find a good place to hide it
If I'm in it I own it

Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surrounding when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah)
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every dogs got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pain to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures ain't say them words and we dry stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now, I'm still thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)
For money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga)
Entire families these mother fuckin' ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepared for the payback because it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz

Cuz when you need it the most ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world

Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unaware-able
He fuck around jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to
Figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, No chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
He was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kids, old snitches
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches

See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh
There's a story in me

Yeah, for life
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me take the stand, damn
Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told
I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile
Knew him since a child, man this game so foul
But niggas made vows to a code I never break
Ridin' in the heavy weight
Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full
If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I sold)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day
Where I surrender to you (surrender), surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do

'Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around (nobody's around)
Cold world (cold world), cold world (mmm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close are the ones will take you down (always take you down)

Yes – but it’s a half a joint in there
Two .40 cals with the hollow points in there
Few bricks of diesel, couple pounds of purple
Gallon of the water, plus a thousand circles

Just ask around 'bout the militia, they malicious
D-block, finish that and cop more dope
I'm two-stroke, you four-stroke
If you got enough cigars we can all smoke
Ain't nothing all good when you all broke
So we could never be equal
Never bite the hand that'll feed you
Never fear a man if he bleed too
Some niggas need a head shot, some niggas need two
Play sweet in these streets and they'll leave you
You can't see the devil, he's see through

Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into heaven, some make it into hell
Nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, nobody want to kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, we're just tryna live our life",Heaven or Hell,2014
Jadakiss,"This for all my real niggas out there
That never got to see another day
All my niggas out there still in the struggle
And still tryna make it out
This for y'all

If I can make it through the night

Another collar, another dollar
Life's short but we live it cause we gotta
Another day, another blessing for a scholar
School of Hard Knocks, just reppin' my alma mater
That was back when I ain't have shit
God on my shoulder with the Devil on the ad-libs
Had to think some decisions through
When times hard, who the fuck you gon' listen to?
Toilet by the bunk, put you in a different mood
Locked up, Thanksgiving eatin' prison food
Back on the ropes, won't see a nigga budge
No bail for a felon so you gotta see the judge
They used to call us all lost niggas
Had the same dreams to make it 'til we lost niggas
Some was married to the game, I divorced quicker
But I can't judge, one day I'll see the lord with you

I'm feeling like I have my fate on the line
Heading closer to the exit sign
If I can make it through the night
This game ain't ever been no friend of mine
I'm just tryna make most of my life, my life
If I can make it through the night
If I can make it through the night
If I can make it through the night

Note from the marshall, you can't even borrow
And it's sad cause they comin' with the padlock tomorrow
And for you to blame the world, gotta blame yourself too
'Cause everybody feel you but nobody can help you
Bad thought get in your head, then you loop it
Stress build up then you do somethin' stupid
Put a mountain in front of you, you just try to move it
Count on one hand the couple niggas you cool with
Either they ain't pickin' up or they ain't got it
You learn the hard way when your actions are idiotic
Product of your environment, and you're the product
Home invasions, niggas is gettin' tied up
This is goin' through your head while you're in the bullpen
Backed into the spot but you should've pulled in
First nigga move and you're on him
But you're really prayin' for a ROR in the morning

I'm feeling like I have my fate on the line
Heading closer to the exit sign
If I can make it through the night
This game ain't ever been no friend of mine
I'm just tryna make most of my life, my life
If I can make it through the night
If I can make it through the night

They say tomorrow ain't promised, most nights I ain't want it to be
Nah a nigga couldn't front it to me
Too many nights for dinner I just ate an uncomfortable sleep
Had to open up the oven for heat
I was a born loser, thoughts of a sinner
Only made it out cause I fought like a winner
Threats all my life, I'm good, was all talk though
Death around the corner, all you gotta do is walk slow
Land of the haves and have-nots
Gun tucked, better to have it than to not
Try to make it out but crabs are in the lot
That'll plot, so if you take a stab you'll get shot
Look, I'm just proof a couple niggas said a prayer for me
Wasn't fair for me, God had to bear with me
Nothin' to live for, didn't have a care with me
Suicidal, had my mama sheddin' tears for me
'Cause my son might need me
Life is hard but dyin' is easy
I thank God every day that I awake
I avoid another funeral, a homi' or a wake
I escape from niggas that lived through it
Better days ahead, we just gotta get to it

I'm feeling like I have my fate on the line
Heading closer to the exit sign
If I can make it through the night
This game ain't ever been no friend of mine
I'm just tryna make most of my life, my life
If I can make it through the night

Tucked inside a duffle Tryna be up outta reach
It's like it came to life and it was sweet enough to speak
Told me call a couple friends of yours and lead me to the street right?, peep it
I go to sleep and see a key, opening a Rover
Same way they used to show us
Told em pay us like you owe us but attention you can keep
Said it's better when it's quiet baby slip that underneath
So to tuck away the convo, conversing in morse code
Seem like everything it should be, til they're beyond those
Putting everything on your leap unless the alarm broke
A ki' might lead to a key to where Nia Long go
Visionary riches turn to missionary missions
But fuck if I'm sitting still unless I'm sitting near a digit
Bet you you'll reconsider if you consider where we get it

I mean, peep it
I go to sleep and see a ki'
Sleep is out the norm
But I'm wit it til the morn
At least, peep it

I go to sleep and see a kilo
Dressed as opportunity, hand over the peep hole
Collecting my gratuity, married to the reload
As long as we repeating we'll never be with the repo's
Call it how it be but we'll never be with the belows
If we looking underneath then we looking up under seats
Now look up at your beliefs, and down at your wrist
Then you look up at what you need and blow it down on a flip
I'm just looking to get a key, the one for the door furthest
And the dream turned into short orders and tall murders
With a fist full of dollars ignorance is so blissful
Wishful in thinking where that ignorance can get you
Get us where we need and we'll call it even and leave
Oversleep cause you know it's easier there to breathe
And sleeping in the thought of the above off the love
Til the lock is all plugged and you banking on a key, you get it?

At least, peep it

Starting to think I need counseling
Cause when I go to sleep I see 36 ounces
Damn, all I remember was the bouncers telling me put the smoke out
Tryna move this coke out, woke up in a cold sweat, then I broke out
Tryin' go back where I left, it ain't right tho
You know I'm in the kitchen to chef, straight nitro
Fiends say when they take a hit, it make the pipe glow
Hoping I see the same shit the next night yo
