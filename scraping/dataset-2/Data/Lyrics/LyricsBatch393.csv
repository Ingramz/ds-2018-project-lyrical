Jack Bruce,"We were walking tall
Made the world look smaller than it was
The hole was bigger than the half
We gave the dogs

They just got the crumbs
Now become much humbler than they thought
The loss was smaller than the gain
And they got caught

Taking stock, future shock
Bull the bears, fight the fair
Take the cake and then run, hear the gun

Get the price for the ice
Hawk the doves, kid the gloves
Have your fun and then head for the sun

Just keep running round and round
Until the final showdown

Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down

We divide and rule
Makes the place feel cooler than it is
The heat is milder than the hell
We left the kids

They just got the shaft
The grade was much steeper and we laughed
The cross was smaller than Lorraine
And it won't last

Making it through the shit
Fattening rats, pirate gas
Smash and grab and then run, hear the gun

Lick the boot for the loot
Kiss the arse do it fast
Have your fun and then head for the sun

Just keep running round and round
Until the final showdown

Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down

Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down

Had to have it all
Made the mall feel bigger than its size
The gap was bigger than the shades
We gave the eyes

They just copped the dregs
Left the eggs more dodgy than the birds
The boss was hauled over the coals
The crazy turd

Raking up all the muck
In the box break the locks
Think of just number one hear the gun

Kill the goose cut 'em loose
Oil the land, nuke the band
Have your fun and then head for the sun

Just keep running round and round
Until the final showdown
Just keep running round and round
Until the final showdown

Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down

Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down

Just keep running round and round
Until the final showdown
Just keep running round and round
Until the final showdown
Just keep running round and round",Bizniz,2003
Jack Bruce,"Living on cold island
Your mail comes on the wind
Messages and memories
Of all the things you've been

Living on cold island
You can't forget the rain
Remembering the long roads
You'll have to try again

And it's always on your mind
(And it's always on your mind)
And the grinding of the stone
(And the grinding of the stone)
Never getting home

Living on cold island
The love comes second hand
Formulas with fantasies
You do the best you can

Living on cold island
You can't keep out the pain
Recalling all the hard miles
You'll have to swim again

I had too much to lose, I'm telling you
I did not choose this life on cold island

Living on cold island
The radio is faint
Victories and voices
Keep calling you a saint

Living on cold island
You can't escape the flames
Burning up the sunset
And spelling out your name

And it's always in your heart
(And it's always in your heart)
And the shining of the track
(And the shining of the track)
Never coming back

",Cold Island,2003
Jack Bruce,"There is a love so unexpected
Defying time and its sad declines
Working in circles so interconnected
Some days it's dark, sometimes it shines

There is a sound welcome as summer
Laughing at fate and its final fall
Dancing in daydreams and racing the runners
Sometimes it takes you, sometimes you take all

Follow the fire down highways and airways
Stopping to pick up fuel from the night
Five or six lives you know you can live with
Five or six voices still singing so right

There's a desire never gets tired
Cuts down the doom and its desert flowers
Turn up the big wheel and slide down the wires
Some days you get burned, some days save hours

There is a feeling closer than comfort
Deriding hate and its history
Turn up the big wheel and slide down the wires
Some days you get burned, some days take some hours

Follow the fire down highways and airways
Stopping to pick up fuel from the night
Five or six lives you know you can live with
Five or six voices still singing so right

There are some shows, more than together
Shaking the rainbows all their bright designs
Pack up your rucksack and head for forever
Some days you drop back, sometimes stay on line
Some days you drop back, sometimes you get back

Follow the fire down highways and airways
Stopping to pick up fuel from the night
Five or six lives you know you can live with
Five or six voices still singing so right

There's a desire, never gets tired
Cuts down the doom and its desert flowers
Turn up the big wheel and slide down the wires
Some days you get burned, some days take some hours
Some days you get burned, sometimes you get burned
Some days you get burned, sometimes you get burned, yeah
Sometimes you get burned, sometimes you get burned",Follow the Fire,2003
Jack Bruce,"Where is the way out of the night
When the dark wind's cryin'?
Where is the way out of the night
Where you're lying?

Where is the time to heal the loss
When the cruel tongues cross
And the heart can't sail?

Where is the way to keep it in
When the sick words win
And you grip the rails?

Where is the place to lay your head
When the streets run red
And your heart's in jail?

Where is the place to lay your head
When the pressure's tight
And the glare so bright?
Where is the way out of the night?

You hit the black, where you just can't hack it no more
The pain caught up, and slammed you down to the floor
How can you fight with the dying of your dreams?
Kelly's Blues, gone with the wind, never green

Where is the way out of the night
When the dark wind's cryin'?
Where is the way out of the night
Where you're lying?

Where was the hand to soothe your brow
When the need was now?
Straying off the line

Where was the friend you could not find?
Tore your open mind
Wrote your name in grime

Where was the way out of the maze
When the days got crazed?
All the games they played
Where is the way out of the night?

You hit the black, where you just can't hack it no more
The pain caught up, and slammed you down to the floor
How can you fight with the dying of your dreams?
Kelly's Blues, gone with the wind, never green
Lying, crying",Kelly's Blues,2003
Jack Bruce,"Each single day has just enough cruelty within
To make them perfect and right
Each single day has just enough dark, deep within
To make it perfect and light

Up against the sky, stars crawl against the night
Each one trying to claw their way out
But each single day has just enough dark
To make me really want, want to stay

Each single day has just enough meanness inside
To make it perfect and calm
Each breathing day has just enough coldness within
To make it perfect and warm

Up against the night, moon's pressed against the sky
Trying to force its way out, out again
But each breathing day has just enough hurt
To make me stay",Milonga Too,2003
Jack Bruce,"I've climbed this hill too many times
Now passion seems like it's a crime
My memories leaves dead on the line
Tomorrow's finished all that fine, fine wine

I've run this road so many years
Remembering how I lived each curve
And now my screen's filled up with tears
I can't see through the pain I learned

No future now without the fear
I'll get too near to love that burns
The night was once, the night was twice
The night was mine

I dealt in dreams until they faded
Into ghosts in headlong flight
Felt every mile that I paid

For reaching out towards the light
The dancers thought it was a raid
And disappeared into the night
That once was mine

I've sailed the storm so many ways
Desires vanish in the haze
There's only ashes from the blaze
The future's losing all the long love days

I've flown these skies both dark and light
But now my heart's blocked up with snow
Most moments felt so very right
But I can't break the ice that grows

No morning now without the chance
Of petals falling from the rose
The night was once, the night was twice
The night was mine

I traded steel until it fractured
Into fields of crumbling rust
All the precautions that I packed

Were colors I could never trust
The swimmer's getting out of sight
She's disappeared into the night
That once was mine

I traded steel until it fractured
Into fields of crumbling rust
All the precautions that I packed

Were colors I could never trust
The swimmer's getting out of sight
She's disappeared into the night
That once was mine",The Night That Once Was Mine,2003
Jack Bruce,"We used to walk those golden streets
But where's the glitter gone?
The times we knew, falling back into blue
From this moment on

We used to sail such silver seas
But they have lost their glow
The days we danced, have denied their romance
Ain't nowhere to go

Looking through cold windows, at the autumn flying by
I wait for memories to come home
All this time, without you, and I search the sky
So sad, the sun is on its own

Love used to wear a sapphire smile
Maybe a diamond grin
The years we played were destroyed in the raids
All the fools that we've been

Look out at the wild world through the sweet and sour rain
I wish the ache would lose its sting
All these broken chances 'cause I missed the train
Tomorrow just don't mean a thing

We used to march against the night
Now there's so little shine
The minds we moved have slipped out of the groove
Now that you are not mine

The seasons just don't rhyme
Life is hardly worth a dime",Progress,2003
Jack Bruce,"Dark in the trees, wind in your hair
Daylight gathering
My kid on his knees digging for gold
Daylight gathering

Green storms from your eyes transformed into air
Daylight gathering
Restless deep sky half truths are told
Daylight gathering

Clear maps of the stars in my daughter's smile
Daylight visible
Beautiful scars days gilded with tears
Daylight visible

Your eyes hold me deep no distance in miles
Daylight's gathering
Robbed of its sleep your touch laced with fears
Daylight gathering

Traces of dark in the sweat of my bass
Calm light gathering
Depths in her glances, light from her face
Calm made visible

The moon looks for her in all the wrong places
Darkness calling
Her eyes still hold deep a love turned from sleep
Dark made audible
Clear maps of the skies in my daughter's eyes
Calmness visible

Star turning words laughing with eyes
Dark made visible
Clouds moving fast across their concrete lives
Darkness visible

We're losing the sight, we're losing the light

Jack Bruce,"So they invented race and made themselves different
From those they banned from grace
They invented race by writing difference in the air

They invented race and carved it in a language
Tattooed it in space and wrote it on skin
So they made up race and programmed it in their cash

And the air's dark in our mouths
It's a bitter light
And the skin fades from our sight
People's faces into forms

So they made-up exotic
And wrote it in color
On parchment backs
As adventure maps, yeah

So they shattered my world to a million pieces
But I hold on to each piece and I number them all
I won't let my children's smiles be shattered into dust

And their currency's contempt
And their power laughs

Dark sown in the land

Sombody open the fuckin door and let me in!
The worlds are about to get me again
Shit ain't pretend I'm safer in the madhouse
Clinging to the selene like a spider
I'm out of your mind like frozen fire
Razorblade fingers scratchin my neck
Lost in the maze I found a dragon barbeque in the back
A arm came out of the toilet and squaws my balls
That shirt hurt got me head but holes in the walls
I wanna see you!
I hear you!
I catch spirits and ghosts by there invisible throats and then tear through (tear through)
Never scary boo bitch I'm a kamikaze
Swimmin through the living room watching joni and chachi
And then I realize I'm potsy trapped in the tv 
Sombody changed the channel and got the better of me

So many dimensions and lines except for these levels of dips and devil
Ain't been alright sense the ghetto better wait for my temper settle
Cause my mind is a madhouse the n9ne fittin spaz out
Player haters don't throw stones if you grind in a glass house
Sometimes when I lash out I pass out how sick and insanse and vain can this be
Wanna fly your little head like a frisbee six six triple eight forty six ninede nine thrisde
This strange and psychopathic homie this is not disney
The madhouse continues to pin you send you psycho bitches to the back of the venue
Then you slitther when like when I'm here in you or off in you
Then my homies 2 dope and Jay do you up somthin real ???

Peekaboo anybody home? where you at?
Tryin to be sneaky creeping behind me mutha facka I saw that rail
Maybe its a mirror or a different person he was grabbin his nuts and spittin and curseing at me fag!
There somethings in this life that I fail to understand even as even as a grown man I don't comprehend
Like how in the fuck did I walk up the stairs and some fucking how I ended up down here
Well laughing and giggleing like a little school girl with my homies Jay and Tech ain't even there Hmmm
What the fuck not a damn single bitch in this place but some ones figgin my nuts

I wanted to hold you
But I kept it inside and my foolish pride
I wish that I'd told you
 
Why can't you be mine
And spend all of my time
I've so much to give and one life to live
I can't be without you

If only I could be the one
To love you forever
If only I could be the one
To cherish forever
 
Don't know if we're coming or going
I just don't know what to do
And so scared to walk away without knowing ooh
 
What can I tell you
I just can't ignore you
Could I be the one, just let me be the one
Someone you can run to

It's time to go outside
I'm gonna be sick for a while
It's gonna be quite some time
If that's what we never had
We gotta get used to it
I'm glad to get used to it fast

Tell me what my name can mean
In the dictionary scene
Yeah that's like over 40 million sold
(Oh) we doing right
But why write when we can type
Computers get me psyched
They'll probably make us slaves in 40 years

And it's time to go outside
I'm gonna be sick for a while
It's gonna be quite some time
If that's what we never had
We gotta get used to it
I'm glad to get used to it fast

And throw the window through the door
We don't use this anymore
I'm not throwing stones
And it means the world to me
Oh three due in time
With the love of love gives life
Oh your heart it helps so much
When we're barely scraping by

That I always have found it best,

But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.

You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,

On the other hand, boy, you shine
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine down my spine.

Might think that your song is bad,
But for a person who's just rehearsin'
Well I gotta say this my lad:

You're the top! You're Mahatma Ghandi.
You're the top! You're Napolean brandy.
You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gall'ry, You're Garbo's sal'ry,
You're cellophane.
You're sublime, You're a turkey dinner.
You're the time of the Derby winner.
I'm a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop.

You're the top! You're a Brewster body.
You're the boats that glide on the sleepy Zuider Zee,
You're a Nathan Panning, You're Bishop Manning,
You're broccoli.
You're a prize, You're a night at Coney,
You're the eyes of Irene Bordoni,
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're an Arrow collar.
You're the top! You're a Coolidge dollar.
You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama,
You're Camembert.
You're a rose, You're Inferno's Dante,
You're the nost of the great Durante.
I'm just in the way, as the French would say
""De trop,""
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're a Waldorf salad.
You're the top! You're a Berlin ballad.
You're a baby grand of a lady and a gent.
You're an old dutch master, You're Mrs. Aster,
You're Pepsodent.
You're romance, You're the steppes of Russia,
You're the pants on a Roxy usher.

That visions are seldom all they seem

I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once,like what you did once upon a dream.
Once upon a night,
I dreamed we'd be together
In love forever.

A never ending.

Jack Cassidy,"Can't we two go walkin' together out beyond the valley of trees?
Out where there's a hillside of heather curtseyin' gently in the breeze
That's what I'd like to do; see the heather but with you.
The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'through the heather on the hill.
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder,there's lazy music in the rill,
And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.
There may be other days as rich and rare,
There may be other springs as full and fare,
But the won't be the same, they'll come and go
For this I know;
That when the mist is in gloamin'
And all the clouds are holdin' still,
If you're not there I won't go roamin' through the heather on the hill,

Jack Cassidy,"This is hard to say, but as I wandered through the lea
I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.

Are dreams that just fell by the way.
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today.
But she never complains
Of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord.
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

He likes the night life,
The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.
When the party's all over,
She'll welcome him back home again.
Lord knows she don't understand him,
But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman;
She loves her good-timin' man.

Or a book or story in song?
Or did you hear some words for the first time today
And find yourself hurting alone?

When the lyrics start telling your story
And Shakespeare starts writing the play
Then those well chosen words by some
Old country verse held all your defenses away

Well, I thought I was over that story
I thought I'd forgotten that song
But old songs were new songs
For fools all alone

And we'll all come around
And we all will be found
Caught in the act of crying alone
Trapped in an old country song

But old songs were new songs
For fools all along

And we'll all come around
In that old country sound
Caught in the act of crying alone
Trapped in an old country song

Jack Cornell,"You might wake up some mornin'
To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise
You'll catch a fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

You might have heard my footsteps
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me runnin'
Through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathin'

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

Like my first time on the night we met
I wish I could go back there tonight, tonight
Looking in your eyes the way you held me tight
Where'd it all the wrong, when it felt so right
There's nowhere I'd rather be tonight, tonight
Tonight
Funny how you said people never change
Always be together 'til the very end
But that was then and this is now
Funny how I held onto your every word
Trusted and believed, no matter what I heard
But that was then and this is now

That no one ever talks about
The little things I think about
That no one ever dreams about

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1992

Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew ya didn't give no lip to big John
(Big John, big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone

Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the promised land, big John

When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man-made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant oak tree he just stood there alone, big John
(Big John, big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out ""there's a light up above!""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, big John

And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine

So just show me the hole way down in the ground
And tell the whole wide world Big John's been found
And he's livin'""

So down in the mine without a sign of a light
Old Queenie went a-lookin' for John that night
She found him there at the bottom of the pit
And placed a red-hot kiss on his cold blue lips
He started breathin' (aah)

She waited a minute and then she kissed him again
And old John got the power of a hundred men
Up he come a-clawin' and a-diggin' like a mole
And said, ""come on Queenie, we're gonna leave this hole""
They started walkin'

Now a roar from the crowd greeted this fine pair
As they both walked out in that cool night air
And up for silence went Big John's hand
And the Queen said, ""I told you I'd get my man
'Cause he moves me""

You can find them today, they're down in New Orleans
Big Bad John and his Cajun Queen
They're a little bit wrinkled from the strain of time
But their love's just as strong as that night in the mine

It's worth its heartache in ransom
Now when that twilight steals
I know how the lady in the harbor feels
When I want rain, I get sunny weather
I'm just as blue, blue as the sky
Since love has gone, I can't get myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
My friend ask me out, but I tell them I'm busy
I've got to get a new alibi
I hang around at home, and ask myself, where is she?
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops
Moving on a stream of dreams
My little memories, those precious memories
Remind me of our crazy schemes
Then somebody says, just forget about her
But I gave that treatment a try
Strangely enough, I got along without her
Then one day she passed me right by, oh well
I guess I'll hang my tears out to dry",Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry,2007

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.

A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,

As it blew through the trees and the trees would bend
I can recall the smell of the rain

And I'd still be there when the storm had passed
Dead to the world, to the morning cast

Was as green as the grass and as cool as a blade

And the voices downstairs getting into a fight
And the next day a silence you could cut with a knife
And feel like a blade at your throat

Was a bed and a desk and couple of tacks

A Saturday afternoon,

As into town they rode.

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude,
Vulgar words of anger,
An' his wife she overheard.

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain,
And the deputy grabbed his gun;
In the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down.

Then he took to the trees and timber
To live a life of shame;
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name.

But a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes.

That come to beg a meal,
Underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill.

It was on a Christmas Day,
There was a whole car load of groceries

Well, you say that I'm an outlaw,
You say that I'm a thief.
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief.

I've seen lots of funny men;

They'll tell you they make less than a dollar a day,
Working the copper claims, risking their lives,
So it's fun to spend Christmas with children and wives.

There's talking and laughing and songs in the air,
And the spirit of Christmas is there everywhere,
Before you know it you're friends with us all,
And you're dancing around and around in the hall.

Well a little girl sits down by the Christmas tree lights,
To play the piano so you gotta keep quiet,
To hear all this fun you would not realize,
That the copper boss' thug men are milling outside.

The copper boss' thugs stuck their heads in the door,
One of them yelled and he screamed, ""there's a fire,""
A lady she hollered, ""there's no such a thing.
Keep on with your party, there's no such thing.""

A few people rushed and it was only a few,
""It's just the thugs and the scabs fooling you,""
A man grabbed his daughter and carried her down,
But the thugs held the door and he could not get out.

And then others followed, a hundred or more,
But most everybody remained on the floor,
The gun thugs they laughed at their murderous joke,
While the children were smothered on the stairs by the door.

Such a terrible sight I never did see,
We carried our children back up to their tree,
The scabs outside still laughed at their spree,
And the children that died there were seventy-three.

The piano played a slow funeral tune,
And the town was lit up by a cold Christmas moon,
The parents they cried and the miners they moaned,
""See what your greed for money has done.""",1913 Massacre,2017

Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing

It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine

Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

Jack French Orchestra,"What good is sitting, alone in your room?
Come hear the music play!
Life is a cabaret, old chum!
Come to the cabaret!
Put down the knitting, the book and the broom
It's time for a holiday
Life is a cabaret, old chum!
Come to the cabaret!

Come taste the wine
Come hear the band
Come blow your horn
Start celebrating
Right this way your table's waiting.

What good's permitting some prophet of doom?
To wipe every smile away
Life is a cabaret, old chum!
So come to the cabaret!

I used to have this girlfriend known as Elsie
With whom I shared for sordid rooms in Chelsea
She wasn't what you call a blushing flower
As a matter of fact she rented by the hour.
The day she died the neighbors
Came to snick her
Well, that is what comes from
Too much pills and liquor.
But when I saw her laid out like a queen
She was the happiest corpse I'd ever seen
I think of Elsie till this very day
I remember how she'd turned to me and say,
What good is sitting all alone in your room?
Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum!
Come to the cabaret!

And as for me
Ha
And as for me
I made my mind up back in Chelsea
When I go
I'm going like Elsie.

Star by admitting
From cradle to tomb
It isn't that long a stay
Life is a cabaret, old chum!
It's only a cabaret, old chum!
And I love a cabaret!",Cabaret,1997

Put your stunna frames on, whoa
Put your stunna-put your stunna-put your stunna frames on

Put your stunna frames on, so you can see what I'm saying
I got that ice on my teeth, you can see what I'm saying
I'm saying - kinfolk, they call me Kinfolk Jones

I got them D.G., Louis V, Armani and the Gucci jones

Cause my future so bright I got to wear shades
And my eyes probably red from the kush and the haze

Walk like a pimp and grab my nuts with my shades on

Jack Frost,"They packed us up in boxes, wooden boxes
And sent us home
Underneath the willow, near the the river
By my headstone
And all you do is carry on

And still you come
I can almost see you, and touch you
My pretty one
When all you do is carry on",Civil War Lament,1991
Jack Frost,"Well you spoke about amnesia, as though it's where it's at
Your lover had a seizure, while her brother fed her pussycat
You were hanging from the railing, like a flag that's just been torn
You were trying, you were failing, you were screaming through the storm
Didn't know where I was, didn't know where I was
I didn't know my name
Didn't know where I was, didn't know where I was
It all looked the same
By the time I reached Wisconsin, it was looking just like Perth
A damaged doomed Charles Bronson stumbling on this earth
When the carburettors buckled your pistons just went slack
From the time that you were suckled, you were crying through the cracks
There's people in the city, there's witches in the caves
There's matchsticks in the kitty, why can't you behave
Torches search the heavens, it's raining out at sea
Everyone has disappeared you keep telling me
Your cover is blown, your smile is cracked
Your house burned down and that's a fact",Didn't Know Where I Was,1991
Jack Frost,"Yeah, and somebody said, if you really want to get ahead
You can make your bed, but you don't have to lie in it
So keep your bad advice, I listened to it once or twice
I'll just throw the dice and wait a minute
Even as we speak, the headlines of the week
They may be wrong, but I'll be strong
And you belong with me
Yeah, and somebody sang, I don't believe in this whole shebang
The Lutherans rang, and I felt the power
I opened up my arms, walked out underneath the palms
And the car alarms went off every hour
Yeah, and somebody wrote, that it might have been a joke
Or just a mistake, at least that's what I reckon
I threw the windows open, it didn't matter that I was broken
I'm still hoping for something better every second
Even as we speak, the headlines of the week
They may be wrong, but I'll be strong
And you belong with me
Even as we speak, when things become more bleak
They may be wrong, but I'll be strong
And you belong with me
Even as we speak, the passing of another freak
They may be wrong, but I'll be strong
And you belong with me

They may be wrong
And you belong with me",Even as We Speak,1991

Why'd you learn to walk, when you can crawl
Every hour god sends some wings
Every hour god sends some stones

You think therefore you are, and you seem
You seem a little nervous, just relax
Just give them all your innocence, you've got stacks
Every hour god sends some wings
Every hour god sends some stones
Now cool out and don't push
Sooner or later they'll give you an ambush

Jack Frost,"As you stumble into the future
Remorselessly moving out of the past
And you separate the reflex moments of living
You drag down the morning into your room
You can sing with your partner
You can sing by yourself
You can sing that everything takes forever
You can sing with the vampires
You can sing with the beast
You can sing that everything takes forever
As you sit at the table you make small decisions
You lie in your bed and you laugh at the dark
You ask yourself a hundred dumb questions
And you answer yourself with a hundred dumb lies

And then tomorrow wake up with a stranger
You drag down the morning into your room

Jack Frost,"Remember when I told you
You were pretty lost
It seems you had it up to here
You just paid the cost
All I have, all I need, all you got, is providence
You're looking pretty tired
Seems you lost some weight
You made it through, I don't know how
That's what you can do
The plants smell sweet in the frozen air
And their silhouettes just fading there
The wolves crouch close against the snow
But where we're running I don't know
In villages and soft sad towns
The candles sway as night comes down
Cold bones creak and strange beasts cry
Watching shadows in the sky
Remember when we were lovers
The things we used to do
The way the wind came through the door
The way it pulled you through
It was over before we knew it
Gone from both our minds
So if you get the inclination
Just think of me sometime",Providence,1991
Jack Frost,"The very second time I walked in this room
You knew that I was gone
And just the way the sun slanted in
Made it all seem wrong
I know you say you love me
And somewhere I think that you do
I love all the tricks you've shown me
I'll cut myself in two
It's coming on again
So I saw the newspaper that had burnt in the fire
The headlines were rain
Go walk outside and clear my head
Down on Albion Lane
I know you live around here somewhere
As I scan the sky
I know that you sleep around here somewhere
Where it's warm and dry
On Saturday afternoon the crowds rolled in clouds
Ignored the rumors of war
We drink a toast to auld lang syne
Stretched out on the floor
I know you'll never remember
And it's better that way
Let this wine take your memory
Of everything before today
",Ramble,1991
Jack Frost,"Well I saw you at the opening
Somebody's hand was up your dress
You were showing off everything
Except your finesse
Thought that I
Thought that I was over you
Thought that I, thought that I
Thought that I was over you
In a shack one night in Brisbane
You said that I'd just missed my flight
Playing cards, raining hard
And holding on with all my might
Like a firework going off in my mind
I have to say it hurt me seeing you have a good time
I know you're there, you've got new friends
From my point of view, well it depends
I'm sure there was a reason
It's pretty clear to me
If he's got a hold on your heart yeah
I hope he shows some mercy

I won't even think what claims you've made tonight

Jack Frost,"I hadn't thought about Mrs. Morgan for years, until I read in the paper
That she had died. When I was a boy, Mrs. Morgan played solo with my
Mother every Tuesday afternoon. There were two other women there, but
I can't remember their names anymore. Monkey, Magden, something like that.
Mrs. Morgan collected opals. Her husband Ted owned a circus, which kept
Him away and out of the picture most of the time. I'd come home from
School and the women would be hard at the cards. I liked Mrs. Morgan, she
Always had a little chip of opal for me, and said that I should save it for
A sweetheart. I came home one day and Mrs. Morgan was crying in our kitchen.
My mother told me to leave them alone. I learned later that a boy from the
Circus had fallen and died. He used to ride the trapeze. Mr. Morgan went out
Of business and they moved away. I've still got the opals. It's funny how

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss

Tears that said goodbye

Sunday morning and I'd best be on my way got a feelin' it will be a busy day
Doing something I'm not looking forward to wish I didn't have to miss you
Broke the clock because I wound it up too tight
Lucky me I didn't sleep a wink last night
So I wish upon a time to do what I must do wish I didn't have to miss you
Wonder who's glass is what I'm seeing through
Because I'm seeing everything with you everything with you
Now it's Sunday and I may go for a hike
Cause when it's Sunday it'll be Sunday day and night
Red is red and black is black and blue is blue I wish I didn't have to miss you

Jack Green,"There goes my only possession
There goes my everything

I hear footsteps slowly walking
As they gently walk across a lonely floor
And a voice is softly saying
Darling, this will be goodbye forever more

There goes my reason for living
There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession
There goes my everything

As my memory turns back the pages
I can see the happy tears we had before
Now the love that kept this old heart beating
Has been shattered by the closing of the door

There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession

Until these arms of mine surround you all the time

Every day I cry a lonely tear a tear of love especially just for you
Until my fantasy becomes reality I'll keep on dreaming until my dreams come true

Jack Greene,"Last night all alone in a barroom I met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips coal black hair and eyes that would tempt any man
Then she came and sat down at my table and as she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her for temptation was flowing like wine

And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside
Then we danced and she whispered I need you
Take me away from here and be my man

Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it the reflection of my wedding band
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home",Almost Persuaded,1966
Jack Greene,"Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end

The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again

The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong

Is living again
And nothing else matters

Jack Greene,"Oh it's crying time again you're gonna leave me
I can see that faraway look in your eyes
And I can tell by the way you hold me darling
That it won't be long before it's crying time

Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
But my love for you could never grow no stronger if I live to be a hundred years old
Oh it's crying time again...

Now you say you found someone that you love better
That's the way it's happened every time before
And it's sure as the sun comes up tomorrow

Jack Greene,"I listened when they said bad things about you
And when they told me I should leave you on the wrong
And they said just walk right out there's nothing to it
But it's the hardest easy thing I've ever done
It seems some people have no feelings at all
For them to break a heart is some sorta fun
Well I'm afraid that's not my way of thinking at all
'Cause it's the hardest easy thing I've ever done

Ever since I left blue tears have fallen
My friends say just forget her dry your eyes
And it sounds so simple when I hear them say it

I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you and hold you just the way I used to do
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you

Jack Greene,"Down every road there's always one more city I'm on the run the highway is my home
I raised a lot of cane back in my younger days
While mama used to pray my crops would fail
Now I'm a hunted fugitive with just two ways outrun the law or spend my life in jail
I'd like to settle down but they won't let me a fugitive must be a rolling stone
Down every road there's always one more city I'm on the run the highway is my home

I'm lonely but I can't afford the luxury of having the one I love to come along
She'd only slow me down and they'd catch up with me
For he who travels fastest goes alone
I'd like to settle down...
I'm on the run the highway is my home",I'm a Lonesome Fugitive,1967
Jack Greene,"She said if I ever deceived her she'd be gone before I could count ten
But I guess that I didn't believe her cause look at the trouble I'm in
She's gone gone gone gone gone gone cryin' won't bring her back
The more that I cry the faster than train flies further on down the track

I've lost every right to be happy when I lost the heaven I found
She warned me she'd leave and she left me before my first tear hit the ground
She's gone gone gone...

If I only knew where to find her I'd crawl to her on my hands and knees
Each tick of the clock so remind her she's one second farther from me

Jack Greene,"It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shacked by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks
And I'd be planted on their columns, now that binds me
Or somethin' that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
And for hours, you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face
And a summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dipped my cup of soap
Back from a gurglin', cracklin' caltron in some train yard
My beard, a roughen coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled down across my face

Through cupped hands around a tin can
I pretend I hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
Ever smiling, ever gentle on my mind

I'm still not over you I find that nothing's changed
And perhaps some day I'll find somebody new

Especially when the whole world was you
But time has been kind to this heart of mine and your mem'ries are almost through
So don't think for a minute that I'll come back to you

Lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine

You didn't even notice that I was standing there
I heard you whisper softly dear God in heaven above
Forgive me please for hurting the one you know I love
If God can forgive you so can I you were not the only one to cry
When you went away dear I've thought that I would die
If God can forgive you so can I

How I wish that love is all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have cause I've got so much to give
And it seems so wrong and it breaks my heart
To know the dollar sign is all that's keeping us apart
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you
And if only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life had not yet crossed our minds
All the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you
But you know we can't live on dreams alone
And to pay the rent I must leave you all alone

But I could wait my dear forever if they'd only let me stay

Came runnin' in all excited slipped and almost hurt herself and I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
I surprised her with a puppy kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her
When I came home from working late cause I would know
That she'd been sittin' there and cryin' over some sad and silly late late show
And honey I miss you and I'm being good and I'd love to be with you if only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad and so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly and found her crying needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring when flowers bloom and robins sing she went away
And honey I miss you and I'm being good and I'd love to be with you if only I could
Yes one day while I wasn't home while she was there and all alone the angels came
Now all I have are memories of honey and I wake up nights and I call her name
And now my life's an empty stage where honey lived and honey played and love grew up

While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",He Is Funny That Way,2000

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Especially in the flower of spring
Not knowing of nature's insistence
Not knowing the honey for its sting

After the petals have drooped
And the staggering years with their own barren fears
And the rose hips double-edged truth
For these roses may have no memory of you
But I do

I followed your trail in dream-time
Though the footprints were long filled with sand
I swore not to walk on that shore any more
Too much wreckage awash on that strand

Of people like me
And I'm living too fast Lord you know I can't last
Too much longer
But little they see that their thoughts of me
Is my savior
And little they know the beat ought to go
Just a little faster

So pick up the tempo just a little
And take it on home
The singer ain't singing
And the drummer's been drinkin'
Too long
Time will take care of itself so leave time alone
And pick up the tempo just a little
And take it on home

I'm wild and I'm mean, I'm creating a scene
I'm goin' crazy
I'm good and I'm bad, I'm happy I'm sad
And I'm lazy
I'm quiet and I'm loud and I'm gatherin' a crowd
Like crazy
I'm 'bout half off the wall but I learned it all
In the Navy

So pick up the tempo
Just a little bit
Take it on home
The singer ain't singing
And the drummer's been drinkin'
Too long
Time will take care of itself so leave time alone
And pick up the tempo just a little
And take it on home

Jack Ingram,"Sherry was a waitress at the only joint in town.
She had a reputation as a girl who'd been around.
On Main street after midnight, a brand new pack of cig's,
A fresh one hanging from her lips, a beer between her legs.
She'd ride down to the river, and meets with all her friends.
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.

Sonny was a loner, he was older than the rest.
He was goin' in the Navy, but could not pass the test.
So he hung around town, he sold a little pot.
The law caught wind of Sonny and one day he got caught.
But he was back in business when they set him free again.
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.

Sonny's playin' eight-ball at the joint where Sherry works
When some drunken out-of-towner put his hand up Sherry's skirt.
Sonny took his pool cue, laid the drunk out on the floor.
Stuffed a dollar in her tip jar, and he walked on out the door.
She's running right behind him, reaching for his hand.
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.

They jumped into the pickup, Sonny jammed it down in gear.
Sonny looked at Sherry, and said let's get on out of here.
The stars were high above them, the moon was in the east.
The sun was setting on them when they reached Miami Beach.
They got a hotel by the water, and a quart of Bombay Gin.
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.

They soon ran out of money but, Sonny he knew a man,
Who knew some Cuban refugees, who dealt in contraband.
Sonny met the Cubans in a house just off the route,
With a briefcase full of money and a pistol in his boot.
The cards were on the table when the law came bustin' in.
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.

The Cubans grabbed the goodies, and Sonny he grabbed the jack
He broke the bathroom window and climbed on out the back.
Sherry drove the pickup down an alley on the side,
Where a lawman tackled Sonny and was reading him his rights.
She stepped out in the alley with a single shot four-ten
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.

They left the lawman dying they made their getaway.
They got back to the motel just before the break of day.
Sonny gave her all the money, he blew her a little kiss.
If they ask you how this happened say I forced you into this.
She watched him as his taillights disappeared around the bend.
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.

Its main street after midnight, just like it was before,
Twenty-one months later, at the local grocery store.
Sherry buys a paper and a cold six-pack of beer.
The headlines say that Sonny well he's going to the chair.
She pulls back onto Main Street in her new Mercedes Benz.
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.",The Road Goes on Forever,1995
Jack Ingram,"Old man comes out of the rain
His heart's as heavy as night
There was a time he was soldier boy
He forgot the times before the war
There was a girl he could have called his wife
But he let her slip right through his hands

He plays guitar on the corner some
Not enough to be a star
But it's enough just to have some fun
And make some people happy awhile

Searching for a sight unseen
For what his father has not been
He's searching for a feeling he calls home

Went to church to pray for a sign
Throw me a rope, Lord, throw me a line
So I can hang on or I can climb
I don't really care

I just want to find my own way
Sing the songs that my guitar plays
Make a child smile, make a daddy cry
Make my mama sing a lullaby

Like ones you may have heard before

I simply could think of nothing more

I love you, I want you and I need you
I'd love to have you by my side
I love you, I want you and I need you
Your love gives my soul a place to hide 

I've thought of different ways to tell you
Words however come up short
Of the way I really feel about you
Of the way you're always on my mind 

How can I say it any different
The words they all mean the same

I love you, I want you and I need you 
A rose is still a rose by another name

The words of those who've come before me
May have sparkled on the page and made you high
All I know is the thought of life without you
Is enough to make the strongest man cry

Amy when I speak to you please listen
Smile, laugh or cry but don't walk away

I love you, I want you and I need you
Please tell me that you feel the same

Wanna tell you I love you, wanna tell you I care
Wanna tell you baby I'm right here
Wanna tell you I'm crying, wanna tell you I'm smiling
Wanna tell you everything I feel

Why don't you come knockin' down my door no more
You don't look at me on the street
You don't smile when you pass by
If you don't turn around soon
You're gonna make this big man, big man cry

And I haven't got much time to let you know
I've got a ticket for Missouri
And there's things I need to say before I go

If I could I'd have you meet me but I don't see how I can
I don't have enough to pay your fare
There's a factory in Columbus hiring now I understand
And they're looking for an able bodied man

You should receive some money
In a letter that I mailed two days ago
But when I wrote the letter saying
You could come to me I didn't know

That I was going to lose my job in such a little while
So now we're going to have to change our plans
They may not hire me in Columbus but I'm pretty sure they will
'Cause they're looking for an able bodied man

If I'd had more education
I'd have made a better life for me and you
But such simple manual labor
Is the only kind of work that I can do

The bus is loading for Missouri so I guess I better go
I'll call you as soon as I can
I'll be sending you a ticket 'cause I think I'll get the job
If they're looking for an able bodied man
And remember I'm your able bodied man

He'd hear an old freight train and he had to roll 
Said he'd been blessed with a gypsy bone 
That's the reason I guess he'd been cursed to roam 
 
He came to town back before the war 
He didn't even know that it was he was looking for 
He carried a tattered bag for his violin 
It was full of songs from places he had been 
  
He talked real easy, had a smilin' way 
He could pass it on to you while his fiddle played 
He was makin' people drop their cares and woes 
They'd hum out loud to tunes that his fiddled bowed 
  
The people there began to join that sound 
Everyone in town was laughin', singin', dancin' round 
Like the fiddler's tunes were all they heard that night 
As if some dream had said all in the world was right 
  
His eye caught a dancing lady there 
She had that rollin', flowin', golden, danglin' kind of hair 
He played for her as if she danced alone 
He played his favorite songs, the ones he called his own 
  
She alone was dancing in the room 
The only thing left moving to his fiddler's tune 
He played until she was the last to go 
He stopped and packed his case and said he'd take her home 
  
In all the nights that passed, a child was born 
And all the years that passed, love would keep them warm 
All their lives they've shared a dream come true 
All because she danced so well to his fiddler's tune 
  
But the train next morning, she blew a lonesome sound 
As if she sang the blues of what she took from town 
All that I recall he said when I was young 
Was no one else could really sing the songs he sung",My Old Man,1995

Of leaving that little girl behind

But she's gonna find a daddy here
And her little girl?s gonna come here too

And Inna?s friends back home, think she's got it made

She says things here going well
She doesn't let the tears touch the page
And stain the letter all to hell

We were waiting in line
I asked her who the Barbie doll was for

And wait 'til the timing was good

All around El Paso the very next day
You see, I'd lost my mind on that broken white line
Before I even reached Balmorhea

To the son of that oil company man
And they buried that poor old sheriff's dead wife
