Randy Newman,"One for each other and all for one
The three brave Amigos are we
Brother to brother and every one
A brave Amigo
We're fighting for justice and liberty
Wherever you find us is where we will be
For the three brave Amigos are we

We are the three Amigos
We are the three Amigos

Over the mountains, across the plains
The three brave Amigos are we
Stamping out evil 'til none remains
The brave Amigos
The three brave Amigos
Wherever they need us, our destinies lead us
Amigos we're always together
And wherever we go, we're three brave Amigos
And we'll be Amigos forever

We are the three Amigos
We are the three Amigos
We are the three Amigos
And Amigos forever we'll be",The Ballad of the Three Amigos [#][Demo Version],1998
Randy Newman,"Got a wife  got a family
Earn my livin' with my hand
I'm a roller in a steel mill
In downtown Birmingham

My daddy was a barber
And a most unsightly man
He was born in Tuscaloosa
But he died right here in Birmingham

[Chorus]
Birmingham  Birmingham
The greatest city in Alabam'
You can travel 'cross this entire land
But there's no place like Birmingham

Got a wife named Mary
But she's called Marie
We live in a three room house
With a pepper tree
And I work all day in the factory
That's alright with me

Got a big black dog
And his name is Dan
Who lives in my backyard in Birmingham
He is the meanest dog in Alabam'
Get 'em Dan

[Chorus]",Birmingham,1998
Randy Newman,"Sounds like a real sad song

Why don't you love me like you used to do?
Are you trying to break my heart?
(Not me, baby)
I know there's somethin' goin' on with you
(Uhh, uhh)
Whatever it is, it's tearin' me apart

I walk along the river every night
Tryin' to figure out why we fuss and fight
Is love once again to slip right through my hand?
(I hope not)
Baby, have you been messin' with another man, oh?
(Oh)

I'm bleedin' all over the place, bleedin' all over the place
I don't mean to be rude but I'm in a pretty bad mood
Just take a look at my face
(Yep, you look awful)

I'm bleedin' all over the place, bleedin' all over
Someone call a doctor
We got a serious case of bleedin' all over the place

Why don't you love me like you used to do?
(He's startin' to repeat himself, now)
Tell me, what did I do wrong?

Seems like you're through with me
I wasn't through with you
My love for you is still very strong
(Oh, yeah?)

I wander aimlessly, not knowing what to do
I've become quite shameless in my love for you
I'm tryin' real hard to understand
Have you been sleeping with another man baby, baby?

I'm bleedin' all over the place
(Ooh, that's a little high for you, isn't it?)
Bleedin' all over
Get me a witness to record my disgrace
How I've been dishonored, deceived and debased

Then someone get me a band-aid
Before I fall on my fuckin' face
Cause I'm bleedin' all over the place",Bleeding All over the Place [Alternate Mix][#],1998
Randy Newman,"Arizona moon keep shining
From the desert sky above
You know pretty soon
That big yellow moon
Will light the way back to the one you love.

Blue shadows on the trail
Little cowboy, close your eyes and dream
All of the doggies are in the corral
All of your work is done
Just close your eyes and dream little pal
Dream of someone

On the Cuyahoga River
Rolling into Cleveland to the lake

Rolling into Cleveland to the lake

There's an oil barge winding
Down the Cuyahoga River
Rolling into Cleveland to the lake

There's an oil barge winding
Down the Cuyahoga River
Rolling into Cleveland to the lake

Cleveland  city of light  city of magic
Cleveland  city of light  you're calling me
Cleveland, even now I can remember
Cause the Cuyahoga River
Goes smokin' through my dreams

Randy Newman,"Something in your eyes
Makes me want to lose myself
Makes me want to lose myself
In your heart

Something in your voice
Makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling will last
The rest of my life

If you knew
How lonely my life has been
And how low I've felt for so long
If you knew
I wanted someone to come along
And change my world
The way you've done
It feels like home

Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm on my way back
Where I come from
Feels like home
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm on my way back
Where I'm from

With your embrace
Down a long dark street
And a sigh of wind in the night
It's alright
Cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see
The dark feels light

If you knew
How much this moment means to me
And how long I've waited for your touch
If you knew
I wanted someone to come along
I never thought I'd love anyone
So much

Feels like home
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm on my way to where I come from
Feels like home to me

Randy Newman,"Margaret: I was born in Gainesville, Florida
And my father was a tailor
And my mother ran a cafe near the university

I've a brother died aborning
And another who's a sailor
I've a sister who is older, and living on her own
I have tried all my life to be kind to others
Even when others were unkind to me
I've been told all my life when I found someone
He would look at me and I'd know

Are you really mine?
Are you really mine?
Does your heart glow
When you see me walkin' down the street, boy?
Do your eyes shine
When you know that we're about to meet?
I don't think they do

And my father was a tailor
And my mother ran a cafe near the university
And she didn't raise a fool when she raised me",Gainesville [#][Demo Version],1998
Randy Newman,"Stay with me for a little while 
You've nowhere to go 
And I've nowhere to go 
It makes me so happy 

When you smile At me 
Work all your life 
And you end up with nothing 
Live in one room like a bum 

Once I flew in a plane 
And I fought in a war 
We lived in a castle 
And slept on the floor 

And I don't want to be 
All alone anymore I'm sorry 
Out in the street 
There's little colored kids playing 

Where my own little boy used to play 
So I sit in this chair 
And I ache with the gout 
And I talk to myself 

'Cause I'm scared to go out 
And I just want to know 
What was it all about I'm sorry",Ghosts,1998
Randy Newman,"Was a little girl
Maybe five-foot-two
Had the cutest little feet
Made my heart go tweet-tweet
Quite a pleasant disposition
Then came a pretty young French girl, mmm
Whom I met in Las Vegas
When I was there with my parents
Oh my Had a real nice conversation
Met a girl at the bakery
She wanted to borrow my car from me
She took it down to Mexico
Ran over a man named Juan
Then I went to college

Met a college girl
She lived in the sorority house
Across from the school
Got a real fine education
Had seven women on my mind
Now I'm married
Have a very lovely wife
Three cute little boys
It's so nice
And that's just half the story
Of the girls in my life","The Girls in My Life, Pt. 1",1998
Randy Newman,"Cain slew Abel Seth knew not why
For if the children of Israel were to multiply
Why must any of the children die?
So he asked the Lord
And the Lord said:

Man means nothing  he means less to me
Than the lowliest cactus flower
Or the humblest Yucca tree
He chases round this desert
Cause he thinks that's where I'll be
That's why I love mankind

I recoil in horror fro the foulness of thee
From the squalor and the filth and the misery
How we laugh up here in heaven at the prayers you offer me
That's why I love mankind

The Christians and the Jews were having a jamboree
The Buddhists and the Hindus joined on satellite TV
They picked their four greatest priests
And they began to speak
They said, ""Lord, a plague is on the world
Lord, no man is free
The temples that we built to you
Have tumbled into the sea
Lord, if you won't take care of us
Won't you please, please let us be?""
And the Lord said
And the Lord said

I burn down your cities-how blind you must be
I take from you your children and you say how blessed are we
You all must be crazy to put your faith in me
That's why I love mankind
You really need me
That's why I love mankind",God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind),1998
Randy Newman,"It's a gone dead train
Yes, it's a gone dead train

My engine was pumpin' steam
And I was grindin' at you hard and fast
Burnin' down the rails, tryin' to heat the way
Haulin' ass and ridin' up the track
And I laughed at the conductor who was tellin' me my coal
It would never last

But then the fire in my boiler
Up and quit before I came
Ain't no empty cellar
Like a gone dead train

Once was at a time when I could
Mama shave 'em dry
And raise a fever ice-down chill
Waitin' at the station
With a heavy loaded sack
Savin' up and holdin' just to spill
Shootin' my supply through my demon's eye
Instead of holdin' my time, I hope I will

But then the fire in my boiler
Up and quit before I came
There ain't no empty cellar
Needs a gone dead train

Yes it's a gone dead train
I'm gonna teach it to learn now, now
It's a gone dead train
Yes it's a gone dead train
I'm gonna teach it to learn now, now
It's a gone dead train
Gonna teach it, gonna teach it to learn

There ain't no easy day
When your daily run's a downhill pull
And there ain't no easy way
Wishin' for some jelly roll
There ain't no switch been made
To make your juicy lemon find
A spring to run a dry well full

But then the fire in my boiler
Up and quit before I came
Ain't no empty cellar
Needs a gone dead train

Yes it's a gone dead train
I'm gonna teach it to learn
You know it's a gone dead train
Gonna teach it, gonna teach it to burn

Randy Newman,"Yes  baby  I been drinkin'
And I shouldn't come by I know
But I found myself in trouble
And I had nowhere else to go

Got some whisky from the barman
Got some cocaine from a friend
I just had to keep on movin'
Til I was back in your arms again

Guilty  baby I'm guilty
And I'll be guilty the rest of my life
How come I never do what I'm supposed to do
How come nothin' that I try to do ever turns out right?

And a great big hard on for the whole human race.

On the avenue?

Randy Newman,"Musically, this one has a sort of overblown, heavenly quality to it. 
But lyrically, it's another story of a guy getting himself into a bad relationship 
That he can't get out of. 

He says, ""When you fall in love with someone who doesn't love you
Someone who treats you so badly it ramifies your head
Someone who doesn't want you but won't let you go
Someone who thinks you're crazy and tells you so, over and over and over

If this happens to you, you're better off dead.""
It's exaggerated, but there's a kernel of truth there for so many people. 
You don't know what bad is until you feel that. 
I know what I'm talking about because I was once a woman who loved too much. 

I know some critic is going to think I don't know what the word ramify means, or how to use it. 
Made up an alternate verb form of it here, like a made-up R&B word, like the ""puppetudes"" of love. Wanted to say how there would be ramifications from something 
That happens to your head in this kind of a relationship. 
I should've said ""blamifies"" or something to make it really obvious I was playing with the word, but I just didn't give a fuck.",Better off Dead,1999

Schools, pretending to have certain businesses. He made a profession of lying. 
I'm not talking about an occasional lie - 
That does not qualify for "";Big Hat, No Cattle."" 
I'm talking about people who base a whole life on lying,

World War I fascinates me because it was such a shock to the world. 
Nothing before or since has come close. 
It was a horrible, horrible event. 
It was modern weaponry and cavalry and then tanks. 
They fought for four years over a hundred yards, some ridiculously small amount of ground. 
It's the stupidest event in history. 
This is one of those songs that I just can't sing - it's right in one of the cracks in my range.

Randy Newman,"When Karl Marx was a boy
He took a hard look around
He saw people were starving all over the place
While others were painting the town
The public spirited boy
Became a public spirited man
So he worked very hard and he read everything
Until he came up with a plan

There'll be no exploitation
Of the worker or his kin
No discrimination 'cause of the color of your skin
No more private property
It would not be allowed
No one could rise too high
No one could sink too low
Or go under completely like some we all know

If Marx were living today
He'd be rolling around in his grave
And if I had him here in my mansion on the hill
I'd tell him a story t'would give his old heart a chill

It's something that happened to me
I'd say, Karl I recently stumbled
Into a new family
With two little children in school
Where all little children should be
I went to the orientation
All the young mommies were there
Karl, you never have seen such a glorious sight
As these beautiful women arrayed for the night
Just like countesses, empresses, movie stars and queens
And they'd come there with men much like me
Froggish men, unpleasant to see
Were you to kiss one, Karl
Nary a prince would there be

Oh Karl the world isn't fair
It isn't and never will be
They tried out your plan
It brought misery instead
If you'd seen how they worked it
You'd be glad you were dead
Just like I'm glad I'm living in the land of the free
Where the rich just get richer
And the poor you don't ever have to see
It would depress us, Karl
Because we care
That the world still isn't fair",The World Isn't Fair,1999
Randy Newman,"Was a bug, little bug, hardly there
How he felt, what he dreamed, who could care?
Without any evidence
(His flaws were many)
He was full of confidence
(Some people haven't any)
Didn't have much common sense
(It's highly over-rated)
He just knew that he'd come through
It's the time of your life so live it well
It's the time of your life so live it well

We may only go 'round one time
As far as I can tell
It's the time of your life so live it well
We may only go 'round one time
As far as I can tell
(He could be wrong about that)
It's the time of your life
It's the time of your life
It's the time of your life so live it well
It's the time of your life so live it well
It's the time of your life so live it well

We may only go 'round this one time
As far as I can tell
It's the time of your life so live it well
Like us all, he started small
Then he grew
When the time came he knew what to do
He knew in order to succeed
(They'd have to work together)
He turned a rock into a seed
(And they were changed forever)
Then they had the strength they'd need
(To get through stormy weather)
Do or die, you gotta try

Isn't it a bit surprising
How one's fortunes ebb and flow
And only to the enterprising
Does the magic fortune cookie go

Show me a man who's gentle and kind
And I'll show you a loser
Now, show me a man who takes what he wants
Ohhhhhhhhh how exciting
Ohhhhhhhhh how exciting
So the poet sings

When you're a fool in love
And nothing goes the way you plan
And no one cares and no one understands
That you're a fool and you're in love
Never another spring for you,
Never a robin to sing for you,
You're out there on your own
When you're a fool in love

When you're a fool in love
Seems like the skies are always grey
You turn around there's someone in your way
And its you, and you're in love

And a rainbow explodes 'cross the sky,
But when you're a fool in love
You'll be a fool 'til the day you die",A Fool In Love,2000

Randy Newman,"I hardly think I'm qualified
To come across all sanctified
I just don't cut it with the cherubim
The town's already on it's knees
Being worshiped is a breeze
I barely know the words to any hymn

Listen if we don't comply
With the locals' wishes
I can see is being sacrificed or stuffed
Let's be gods, the perks are great
El Dorado on a plate
Local feelings should not be rebuffed

It's great to be a god
Tread where mortals have not trod
Be defied when really you're a sham
Be an object of devotion
Be the subject of psalms
It's a terrifying notion
All those prayers and those salaams
Any normal man would bridle if he's forced to be an idol
And a normal man's exactly what I am

All the same it's pretty clear
The scoundrels don't keep much up here
They must have zillions under lock and key
But gods can force then to unleash
Enough to make us nouveau riche
Beyond our wildest dreams so follow me

Can't you see I won't relax
If religious maniacs
Tell me I'm all-powerful and sublime
How can I be their belief
When I'm lying through my teeth
Why don't we just say some other time

It's tough to be a god
But if you get the people's nod
Count your blessings, keep them sweet is my advice
Be nirvana, be salvation
Be all things to all men
Butter up your congregation
Every Sunday score a ten
The alternative is dire
Simply frying pan to fire
So sign on two new gods for paradise",It's Tough to Be a God,2000

Well I can just get off of this L.A. freeway
Without getting killed or caught
Down the road in a cloud of smoke
To some land that, baby, we ain't bought

Leave the key in that old front lock

Randy Newman,"I'd like to say
A few words
In defense of our country
Whose people aren't bad
Nor are they mean
Now, the leaders we have
While they're the worst that we've had
Are hardly the worst
This poor world has seen

Let's turn history's pages, shall we?

Take the Caesars, for example
Why, with the first few of them
They were sleeping with their sister, stashing little boys in swimming pools, and burning down the city
And one of 'em, one of 'em appointed his own horse to be Counsel of the Empire
That's like vice president or something
That's not a very good example right now, is it?
But here's one:
Spanish Inquisition
That's a good one
Put people in a terrible position
I don't even like to think about it
Well, sometimes I like to think about it

Just a few words
In defense of our country
Whose time at the top
Could be coming to an end
Now, we don't want their love
And respect at this point's pretty much out of the question
But in times like these
We sure could use a friend

Hitler
Stalin
Men who need no introduction

King Leopold of Belgium, that's right
Everyone thinks he's so great
Well, he owned the Congo
He tore it up too
Took the diamonds
Took the silver
Took the gold
You know what he left 'em with?

Malaria

You know, a president once said, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself""
Now it seems like we're supposed to be afraid
It's patriotic, in fact
Color-coded
What we supposed to be afraid of?
Why, of being afraid
That's what terror means, doesn't it?
That's what it used to mean

You know, it pisses me off a little that this Supreme Court's gonna outlive me
Couple young Italian fellas and a brother on the Court now too
But I defy you, anywhere in the world, to find me two Italians as tight ass as the two Italians we got
And as for the brother
Well, Pluto's not a planet anymore either

The end of an empire
Is messy at best
And this empire's ending
Like all the rest
Like the Spanish Armada
Adrift on the sea
We're adrift in the land of the brave
And the home of the free

Randy Newman,"Has anybody seen me lately
I tell you why
Has anybody seen me lately
I tell you why
I caught something that made me so sick
That I thought that I would die
And I almost did

First my knees begun to tremble
My heart begin to pound
First my knees begun to tremble
My heart begin to pound, was arythmy
Got it to lost my equilibrium
Still face down on the ground

As I lay there on the cold pavement
A tear ran down my face
'Cause I thought I was dying
You boys know I'm not a religious man
But I sent a prayer out just in case, never know
You know almost immediately I have has reason to believe
That my prayer had been heard in a very special place
But this is what happened, I heard this sound

Ooooo
Yes
Oooo
Yes
Ooooo
It was harps and angels
Harps and angels
Coming near
I was too sick to roll over and see 'em
But I could hear them singing
Ever so beautifully in my ear

Then the sound began to subside
And then sound like background singers
This voice come down
From the heaven above
Was a voice full of anger from the Old Testament
A voice full of love from the new one
It was priestly love
Like it was the middle of the day

And I laid there quietly
Listening to what that voice had to say
You ain't been a good man
You ain't been a bad man
But you've been pretty bad
Lucky for you, this ain't you're time
Someone very dear to me as made another clerical error
And we're here on a bit of wild goose chase
But I want to tell you a few things 
That'll hold you in good stead
When it is your time
So you better listen close
I'm only going to say this once

[Chorus:]
Lay you on the table
Keep your business clean
Lay you on the table
Keep your business clean

Don't want no backstabbing
Ass grabbing, you know exactly what I mean
Alright girls go outta  here

Encore, encore
He spoke French
Tres bien
Encore
And off they went into the night
Almost immediately I felt better
Now I'm round here to see you boys
'Cause you know we ain't living right
And while it was fresh
I wanted to tell you
What he told me
He said

[Chorus:]
Yes there won't be no harps and angels
Coming for you
Will be trombones, kettles drums
Pitch forks and tambourines

Sing it like they did for me
Yes
Beautiful
Wish I spoke French
So actually the main thing about this story is, for me
There really is an after life
And I hope to see all of you there

Of course it does

The greatest singer in the world today
If she's there and wants to get away
Then bring her here to the U.S.A.

I'll be the first to give him the news

Randy Newman,"Welcome, welcome, welcome
To this great arena
Durham, North Carolina
The heart of the research triangle
We've come to this particular place tonight
We've gotta look at things from every angle
We need some answers to some complicated questions
If we're going to get it right
To that end we have here gathered 
Some of the most expensive scientists in the world
Eminent scientists, that is
We got biologists, biometricians
We got a quantum mechanic and astrophysicians
We got a cosmologist and cosmeticians
We got an astronaut, we got an astroboy

We got he-doctors, she-doctors
Knee doctors, tea doctors
We got a lumberjack and a life coach

On the other side, we have the true believers
We got the Baptists, the Methodists, the Presbyterians
Episcopalians are here, pass the hat
We got the Shakers, the Quakers
The anti-innoculators
The big-boss line from Madison Town
The Six Blind Boys, Five Tons of Joy
Give 'em room or get outta the way
We got a Bible-belter from the Mississippi delta
Have them all arraigned

Scientists, are you ready?
First question
Dark matter
Ooh, dark matter
Get me someone who knows somethin' about space
Nice space music, Georgie
Alright, what is it?
Where is it?
Can we get some?
Stand up sir, what's your-
You are standing, forgive me
Dark matter, go ahead

Dark matter is out in space
It's seventy-five percent of everything
Just a moment, sir
Do yourself a favor, use our music, people like it and
Your music's making people sick
Alright, it's a free country
Go ahead with dark matter, what is it?
We don't know what it is
But we think it's everywhere
I'll take a look at it
Can we get someone down here?
Of course not!

Let me get this straight
You don't know what it is
You don't know where it is
And we can't get any
Put that to the one side
Let's put the Lord, faith, eternity
Whatever on the other side
Show 'em Vance

I'll take Jesus, I'll take Jesus
I'll take Jesus everytime
I'll take Jesus, I'll take Jesus
I'll take Jesus everytime
Yes, I would
Yes, I would
Yes, I would
Yes, I would
I'll take Jesus, I'll take Jesus
I'll take Jesus everytime

Alright
One-nothing
Next one is going to be a hard one
It's about the theory of evolution
And it's about animals also
So get me someone who knows somethin' about evolution and animals
Who you got?

Woah
You're a beautiful woman, aren't you?
It doesn't matter of course
This science thing doesn't work out for you
Don't boo me, don't boo me 
I'm just kidding, you know that
Here's my question
Explain me the giraffe
Go ahead
Elaborate with pleasure, miss
The giraffe, to survive, must eat leaves high up on the Yabba Yabba tree
That's true, isn't it?
Of course it is, everyone knows that
But Mr. Darwin's giraffe, a half-way giraffe, with a half-way giraffe neck
Could never reach the highest branches of the Yabba Yabba 
Therefore, it could not have survived
It's only common sense
Unfortunately for you, Mr. Charles Darwin didn't have any common sense
Evolution is a theory
And we have just now, tonight, disproved it
Show of hands

I'll take Jesus, I'll take Jesus
I'll take Jesus everytime
I'll take Jesus, I'll take Jesus
I'll take Jesus everytime
Yes, I would
Yes, I would
Yes, I would
Yes, I would
I'll take Jesus everytime

Alright, two-nothing
Next question, global warming
Is it? And if so, so what?
One the true believers seems to be recognized
Hand over a mic, Charles
Thank you

Sir, you know what you are
You're an idiot
You're a strong man, a fabrication
You see, the author of this little vignette, Mr. Newman
Self-described atheist and communist
Creates characters like you as objects of ridicule
He doesn't to believe anything he has you say
Nor does he want us to believe anything you say
Makes it easy for him to knock you down, hence a strong man
I myself, believe in Jesus
I believe in evolution also
I believe in global warming 
And in life everlasting
No one can knock me down

Oh, we can knock you down, mister
We can knock your communist friend down, too
Communist? He called me an idiot
We've been knocking people like Mr. Newman down for years and years
Like this, sir

Randy Newman,"It's me comin' at you
From the land beyond
I'm up here in heaven
Where I belong
I'm gonna tell you my story
About a man who's down in hell
He ain't up here anyway
As far as I can tell
This man stole my name
He stole my soul
They're so holy up here
They don't understand
But he even tried to steal my jellyroll
So here it is, my story
Here it is from the top

My name is Sonny Boy Williamson
I come from Jackson, Tennessee
Being a man named Sonny Boy
Might bother you, it never bothered me none
My mother loved me, my wife did too
I had a dream and the dream come true
I wrote some songs that the people knew
Like ""Good Morning School Girl"" and ""Jackson Blue""
Around the time of the great migration
The blues run up the river, spread across the nation
I run up with 'em caused a great sensation
Selling biscuits on the radio in Chicago
Out on the Westside to see the sights
Turned a corner, see my name in lights
Said I'd been playin' there for fourteen nights
This I had to see
This big old ugly cat was on the stage
Twice my size, about my age
Played six songs, five were mine
If I said he was good I'd be lyin'

Then he says ""What's my name?""
The crowd says ""Sonny Boy!""
He says ""What's my name?""
They go ""Sonny Boy!""
And he says ""What's my name?""
I said ""Hold it,
My name is Sonny Boy Williamson
The one from Jackson, Tennessee
Don't know who you are
Or where you come from
But one thing I do know
You ain't me, son""
I looked in his eyes
And they was red
As was the rangtang hair dye
All over his head
Scared me so bad I ran outside
Looked for a place to hide
Ran 'round a corner
Smack into a robbery
They were shootin' each other
But they hit me
Next thing I know I came up here
In the middle of my thirty-fourth year

Now I'm the only bluesman in heaven
It makes me kind of sad
I know only one
Died so young
Didn't have the time
To do nothing bad
As for Sonny Boy Two
The man who stole my name
He went on to glory, fortune and fame
He's the one who went to England
Tried to teach those English boys the blues
He said what do I have to lose?
Well, it killed him
Yeah, it killed him

I'm the only bluesman in heaven
And I'm lonely as can be
Lord, if you're listening
Hear my plea
Send down a bluesman
To play the blues with me

This is Sonny Boy Williamson
Number One

I was glad we came
I'm the only from the family to make it
But I know they'd say the same

And a last baby boy
A little caboose we call the light of our life
And that's who I'm waiting for

Where is my wandering boy tonight?
Where is my wandering boy?
If you see him, push him towards the light
Where is my wandering boy?

He went over that harbor there
When he was five years old
Laughing like a maniac
Shining in the sun like gold
He was afraid of nothing then
He was loved by everyone
I see it clear as I see you
That day there in the sun

I hope he's warm and I hope he's dry
And that a strangers eye is a friendly eye
And I hope he has someone close by his side
And I hope that he'll come home

Yo no le temo a la oscuridad

Amigo soy de la noche
Aunque me rodee tanta maldad

Soy una gárgola...

Why mas buenas 'tan las nenas
Que cuquean por la disco 
Solas, solicitando why solteras
Se mueren por reggaeton...
Why le da con perrearme prendida en candela
Ella busca activarse, sin pensarlo soltarse
Llama fuerte la atención pa' ver quien la complace
Le gusta los diamantes, flow de gangster

Suelta, why lo que veo no lo creo
Ella rompe bien la cintura why me juqueo
Se da cuenta why me sigue el maquineo
Le bateo, la rodeo, llevándola de paseo
Otra gatita gárgola, que no sabe
Que antes que amanezca me la tengo que comer
Porque soy una gárgola, me mantengo en lo oscuro
Seguro, porque voy pa'l cuarto nivel

Like a flower crying

From my tender sentimental woes

Randy Phillips,"As I look back on what I thought was living
I'm amazed at the price I choose to pay
And to think I ignored what really mattered
Cause I thought the sacrifice would be too great
But when I finally reached the point of giving in
I found the cross was calling even then
And even though it took dying to survive
I've never felt so much alive

For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live
Not I but Christ that lives within me
His Cross will never ask for more than I can give
For its not my strength but His
There's no greater sacrifice
For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live

As I hear the Savior call for daily dying
I will bow beneath the weight of Calvary
Let my hands surrender to His piercing purpose
That holds be to the cross but sets me free
I will glory in the power of the cross
The things I thought were gain I count as loss
And with His suffering I identify
And by His resurrection power I am alive

For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live
Not I but Christ that lives within me
His Cross will never ask for more than I can give
For its not my strength but His
There's no greater sacrifice
For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live

And I will offer all I have
So that His cross is not in vain
For I found to live is Christ
And to die is truly gain

For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live
Not I but Christ that lives within me
His Cross will never ask for more than I can give
For its not my strength but His
There's no greater sacrifice
For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live

Randy Phillips,"Standing on the shoreline, looking out to sea
At oceans of Your hopes for me, just beyond my reach
I've been here on this island for way too many years
A prisoner of my comfort, a slave to my own fear
Doubt is saying got to stay, faith is saying sail away

I know it's safe here on the shore
But freedom is worth dying for
Liberation comes to those
Who hear the truth and sail with You

I'll go where You are calling me
I'll be what You meant me to be
I know the risk is real, but I wanna feel
The freedom of the sea

With eyes to the horizon, mist against my face
I'll leave behind this island in Your abounding grace
With Your word as my compass I'll chase my destiny
For I know the words of Your will can set my spirit free
Doubt is saying got to stay, faith is saying sail away

I know it's safe here on the shore
But freedom is worth dying for
Liberation comes to those
Who hear the truth and sail with You

I'll go where You are calling me
I'll be what You meant me to be
I know the risk is real, but I wanna feel
The freedom of the sea

Doubt is saying got to stay
But I'm taking up the anchor
Faith is saying sail away
And I'm heading for the deep

I know it's safe here on the shore
But freedom is worth dying for
Liberation comes to those
Who hear the truth and sail with You

",Freedom of the Sea,1998
Randy Phillips,"Once there was a holy place
Evidence of God's embrace
And I can almost see mercy's face
Pressed against the veil

Looking down with longing eyes
Mercy must have realized
That once His blood was sacrificed
Freedom would prevail

And as the sky grew dark
And the earth began to shake
With justice no longer in the way

Mercy came running
Like a prisoner set free
Past all my failures to the point of my need
When the sin that I carried
Was all I could see
And when I could not reach mercy
Mercy came running to me

Once there was a broken heart
Way to human from the start
And all the years left it torn apart
Hopeless and afraid

Walls I never meant to build
Left this prisoner unfulfilled
Freedom called but even still
It seemed so far away

I was bound by the chains
From the wages of my sin
Just when I felt like giving in

Mercy came running
Like a prisoner set free
Past all my failures to the point of my need
When the sin that I carried
Was all I could see
And when I could not reach mercy
Mercy came running to me

Sometimes I still feel so far
So far from where I really should be
He gently calls to my heart
Just to remind me

Mercy came running
Like a prisoner set free
Past all my failures to the point of my need
When the sin that I carried
Was all I could see
And when I could not reach mercy
Mercy came running to me

Awesome Lord.
Victorious Warrior, Commanding King of Kings,
Mighty Conqueror and the only time,
The only time I ever saw him run,
Was when

He ran to me,
He took me in His arms,
Held my head to His chest,
Said ""My son's come home again!""
Lifted my face,
Wiped the tears from my eyes,
With forgiveness in His voice He said
""Son, do you know I still love You?""

The day I left home,
I knew I'd broken His heart.
And I wondered then, if things could ever be the same.
Then one night,
I remembered His love for me.
And down that dusty road, ahead I could see,
It was the only time,
It was the only time I ever saw Him run.

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Of paradise, where roses grew

Randy Rogers,"Does everybody know that I'm to blame
None of you friend up in Fort Worth even know my name
But even if I tried, well if I tried to be true
If I'd walk a line, I'd still be losin you

Tell me what you think I should do
Cause I just can't understand you 
I'm about to speak my mind

Randy Rogers,"It didn't matter Tommy Jackson was running free
Cause the man he killed never mattered much to me
There's talk in our town about where Tommy might run
Wondered if it mattered, he has used my gun

80 Miles East of the line down on my grand daddy's farm
He laid low just for the night and he slept there in our barn
I watched him steal our Ford and drive away in the sun
18 Years of getting older now a dead man on the run

[Chorus]
Isn't love a funny thing with a pistol in your hand
Close you eyes and bow your head to pray if you can
Well you sealed your fate when you picked up that shotgun
18 Years of getting older now a dead man on the run, on the run

For 15 days Tommy kept his conscience between the lines
His ex-wife and a cold jail cell were always on his mind
He ran out of cash at an east-bound truck stop
But he found work there at Fritz's muffler shop
Fritz was a good man and Pamela was his wife
2 kids a nice home and on the surface a good life
But drunk on Whiskey Pam and Tommy had some fun
18 Years of getting older now a dead man on the run

[Chorus]

Now every Sunday morning she goes down to the place where he lays
She tells Tommy how she never wanted things this way
Rest in Peace Tommy Jackson 1981

Close the door now, close the door now
Won't you let me in? Why won't you let me in?

Cause it's been six long days and I'm on my way
Will I ever see the end?
I've got a heavy load down a dead end road
And I can't sleep again, no I can't sleep again

Hold the phone now, hold the phone now
You're calling again, why won't you call again?

Say my name little girl, say my name little gir
Even though it's a sin, yeah you know it's a sin

It will be easy when I'm not around 
Come Sunday I'll be feelin down 
You can run right back to me

But I can't tell you where I go
Maybe you don't need to know
This path the road leads me down
Ain't the same one others see

Cause I'm high and I'm low 
This roller coaster is out of control
I can't tell the sky from the ground
It's wrong, but it's right
It's gonna be another long night
I can see the lights of the next town
And I can't slow down

It was good to be back home
When you left I got drunk alone
I let the whiskey burn a hole
Right through you and me

But I'm too scared to put it down
Cause it gets me to the next town
And if that's wrong at least you know 
You can always blame me

Randy Rogers,"I've been down and I've been out 
I washed up when I thought I would drown 
I've been down and I've been out 
Never flown so high with both feet on the ground 

I've been walking in circles, all my life 
Chasing my own tail 
I've got a penny in my pocket but the rest of my change 
Is down at the bottom of the well 
I've got my mind made up but what I can't figure out 
Is how am I gonna leave my mark 
When all I've got left is doubt 

I've been down and I've been out 
I washed up when I thought I would drown 
I've been down and I've been out 
Never flown so high with both feet on the ground 

I've wasted my time all these years 
Just looking for a little bit more 
But it's hard to keep your shoes clean 
When all you've got is dirt on the floor 
And I've hit rock bottom with some good friends of mine 
We sat and watched the sun rise but we never saw it shine 

There's a man on the radio says he's got it all worked out 
He's got a show on the road but he don't know 
What it's all about

Randy Rogers,"3 a.m. and I'm all alone, try to call but I doubt you're home. Not much has changed here on my end. Sure would be good to see you again. I know we had our fights. Nothing since has felt that right. Lived my life from day to day. If I don't think too much everything is okay.

I miss holding your hand, miss going on walks, miss being your man. I miss watching you sleep, guess I just miss you.. with me.

I still drive that same ol' car, still work at that run down bar. Still hang out with that same group of guys, and on Saturday nights, still go that dive. Been two months since I had a drink. Damn good for me, don't you think? Oh, its been a year now since you've gone. Oh I've tried my best, I can't move on..

Cause' I miss holding your hand. Miss going on walks, miss being your man. I miss watching you sleep. Guess I just miss you with me..

If you give me a second chance, I'll never let you go. Swallowed all my pride and now I got a let you know..

I miss holding your hand, miss going on walks, miss being your man. I miss watching you sleep, guess I just miss you.. I guess I miss you.. with me.

It may be wrong but tonight I'm gonna see those city lights
Cause it sure as hell beats lying here
Wishing I was on your mind

So tonight I'm walking and you started talking
About what you said we would never be
Oh and I've been worried it's the same old story I never know if you're gonna leave
I say it's the last time, just like I always do
I give you another chance and I lay it all on you

I caught myself out drifting
I guess sometimes it's good to be alone

If it was up to me I'd still be a mess

'Cause I'm a whole lot better than I ought to be
Don't know why things keep going right for me
All I've ever done is run wild and free
I'm a whole lot better than I ought to be

And oh, I don't wanna wake up
I just wanna keep living this dream
Oh, I could never make up
Anything as good as what's happening to me

Well, I try my best but I can do no wrong
Blues come my way but they never stay long
I thought I had it all when I didn't have a buck
Now it ain't easy having all the luck

Leaves me lonely only for the night and everyday
You always run away from me and I run away from you

It's all the same, I'm ashamed it had to turn out this way
Now every time reminds me how it's all a big cliche
You always run away from me and I run away from you

And I wish this time you would be mine for good
But the reason why you never stay is you say
You didn't know you could

Didn't know you could turn back right then
And spend your life with someone you just let go

A once in a lifetime blind love never saw the light of day
It cost us forever for better or for worse
That's the price we pay

And I wish this time you would be mine for good

Someone would have long ago found El Dorado
So luck to you, cowboy, I'm movin' on

Play your cards as they lay on the table

The only place that ever really mattered to me
Was the one place I just couldn't go

Smell the rain comin' in on the wind

Lost some friends along the way
Had nobody at our shows
And nights we didn’t get paid
There’s been bar tabs and b.s
Choices, good and bad

Well, you tell me man, you’ve been there
You know I had to have a few drinks of courage
Yeah, me too, I was nervous as hell

Come and get me right now
'Cause I done lost my woman
And I need a night out

Said I can't burn it down
'Cause I'm gettin' up early
I'm down for one round
But around 1:30
I was sittin' at a Waffle House
I think I had grits
Started hittin' on a waitress
Everything after that gets fuzzy

Like a TV in a cheap motel
My head feels funny
I lost my keys
I lost my cell
And all of my money

Did I crash a party
Have a run in with the law
Take a swim in a fountain
I don't know
'Cause it's all kinda fuzzy

There's a ring on my finger
There's a bra on the lamp
Gotta get outta this hot tub
And try to find my pants

Who the hell is Heather
And when were we together
'Cause I've got every letter of her name on my chest
Think I got a shiner
A cigarette burn
Nothing in that bottle of tequila but the worm

It's fuzzy
Like static on the radio
My head feels funny
I lost my watch
I lost my clothes
And all of my money

Did I call my momma
Try to break into the mall
Did I even pay the cabbie
I don't know
'Cause it's all kinda fuzzy

I remember how it started
After that it's just a blur
Is it a Sunday or a Monday
Am I suppose to be at work

It's fuzzy
Like a tennis ball on my tongue
My mouth feels funny
I'm blinded by the sun
But things ain't sunny

Will the room stop spinning
Will I find my car
On my way back home right now

And a rose of a different name.

So I closed my eyes",I Met Lonely Tonight,2010
Randy Rogers Band,"I tried to find my way around here
But there's no street signs in this town
It's gettin' dark I can hardly see
Because all the lights are burned out
I tried to stop somewhere and ask
But all the stores are closed down

Where the hell am I?
Where the hell are you tonight?

[Chorus]
I've been looking for you so long
Down every road I've been on
In every empty glass
And every jukebox sad song
I've been lying to myself
And everyone can tell
Since you've been gone
I've been looking for you so long

I know why
I'm the reason why
My shattered heart is on the run
Doubt I deserve a second chance
But I'd do anything to get one
The more I try to get back to you
The more it all comes undone

Where the hell am I?
Where the hell are you tonight?

[Chorus]

I'm lost
I'm trying to find you here
In someone else's town
In the middle of nowhere
Out of gas

Me by

One more day with you

We don't have to go anywhere
We don't have to try something new

As long as I'm with you
Baby let's just take a drive
It's already getting late
Let's go kiss the sundown
Out on the interstate

Let's drive through town, down to the lake
We'll beg the moon to take it's time stealing the day
Just let me hold you, til the stars fill the sky
And one by one I'll watch them dance into your eyes

We both know that I'm your fool
So tell me something new
A lie that I can buy into
Just don't tell me the truth

Just this one time, dance all around
The point you're trying to get across
Take my word I don't need to be reminded
When it comes to you, I've already lost

I spend my nights a runnin' or I'll spend my days in chains

This is my last last chance to get it right, right, right
So I won't have to hear my mamma cry, cry, cry
I stumble through the darkness just tryin' to find a light
This is my last last chance to get it right

I keep one hand on the Bible, I got one hand in the flame
I try to live the good life but it's all in vain
If I got to do it over, it would still turn out the same

Randy Rogers Band,"The bright lights and the big city life
Drove you right outta town
I watched you leave with a smile on my face
I knew I never could tie you down
You got settled in, down at the Seashore Inn
And you made some new friends of your own
Now it's been two years and I'm not quite sure
But I don't think you're coming home
While you're staring at the stars tonight
I'm all wrapped up in blue

[Chorus]
If I had it my way
I'd be on that train to L.A.
'Cause I never met somebody quite like you
And I think it would be awesome
If you'd get on that plane to Austin
Maybe missing you is more than I can do

We both knew that it was long overdue
But you finally got your break
Now you get to see the world and I'm so proud
Everybody knows your name
Don't take this wrong because I know you belong
Out there on that stage
But I swear if my life was an open book
It would be missing a page

Somewhere else

[Chorus]
You gotta run like you've never run before
Up ahead there is so much more
Than the life you left behind
You gotta go, throw caution to the wind
You'll never get this chance again
You'll find a new place to hide
Starting over for the last time

A burning box of memories I can't put out
It just seemed easier to me, to let it be
One more night in this old house and there's no doubt
That before too long
I'll be gone, gone, gone

Over and over again
A brand new start

He ain't listenin' to a word you say
He doesn't look at you the way I would

I should steal you away

I've been wondering
Are you looking at me
Thinking how it might be, if you were mine

I washed up when I thought I would drown 
I've been down and I've been out 
Never flown so high with both feet on the ground 

I've been walking in circles, all my life 
Chasing my own tail 
I've got a penny in my pocket but the rest of my change 
Is down at the bottom of the well 
I've got my mind made up but what I can't figure out 
Is how am I gonna leave my mark 
When all I've got left is doubt 

I've been down and I've been out 
I washed up when I thought I would drown 
I've been down and I've been out

I've wasted my time all these years 
Just looking for a little bit more 
But it's hard to keep your shoes clean 
When all you've got is dirt on the floor 
And I've hit rock bottom with some good friends of mine 
We sat and watched the sun rise but we never saw it shine 

There's a man on the radio says he's got it all worked out 
He's got a show on the road but he don't know

Come and get me right now
'Cause I done lost my woman
And I need a night out

Said I can't burn it down
'Cause I'm gettin' up early
I'm down for one round
But around 1:30
I was sittin' at a Waffle House
I think I had grits
Started hittin' on a waitress
Everything after that gets fuzzy

Like a TV in a cheap motel
My head feels funny
I lost my keys
I lost my cell
And all of my money

Did I crash a party
Have a run in with the law
Take a swim in a fountain
I don't know
'Cause it's all kinda fuzzy

There's a ring on my finger
There's a bra on the lamp
Gotta get outta this hot tub
And try to find my pants

Who the hell is Heather
And when were we together
'Cause I've got every letter of her name on my chest
Think I got a shiner
A cigarette burn
Nothing in that bottle of tequila but the worm

It's fuzzy
Like static on the radio
My head feels funny
I lost my watch
I lost my clothes
And all of my money

Did I call my momma
Try to break into the mall
Did I even pay the cabbie
I don't know
'Cause it's all kinda fuzzy

I remember how it started
After that it's just a blur
Is it a Sunday or a Monday
Am I suppose to be at work

It's fuzzy
Like a tennis ball on my tongue
My mouth feels funny
I'm blinded by the sun
But things ain't sunny

Will the room stop spinning
Will I find my car
On my way back home right now

I can tell which way that you're leaning
Don't know what it is but I got a feelin'
You're almost all gone
I'm scared that when you start believing
You and me baby will end up being one more sad song

Who will I be in these shoes?

I don't know if I could make it

Something inside me kept holdin' me back,
I knew what to say before she drove away

Shots rang out as I stumbled home

I didn't want to know if they were shooting at me

Twenty feet away from me but I got out alive

The tables got my money even though my friends had warned me
So I hopped in the taxi, we headed down Canal
By the time we got back to the bus it had already gone down
It was a bucket full of concrete through our window
We were getting robbed but the cops they never showed

No I wouldn't want it any other way
Not knowing what might happen today, ain't that a shame

In Missoula Montana we were out on tour
With country music's brightest star that we knew for sure
And I won't say what we did but one of us went too far
Got picked up by the police after we all left the bar
That next morning we looked everywhere
Bout the time we hit the stage he'd barely posted bail

I got up to go for a drive

But around up on your street
I know that we said we shouldn't do this anymore
Ah, but lonely is prone to forget
So, I'm standing at your door
Well, maybe it's not right
Maybe that don't matter tonight

How 'bout one more goodbye

Let it burn till the morning light
And let it fade away
Girl, we don't even have to pretend
We ain't going back to where we've been
We both know it's not worth another try
But how 'bout one more goodbye

I know we'll regret
If you let me in
We can ask forgiveness tomorrow
If you stay in my arms until then
We don't have to be alone
I don't care if it's wrong

How about one more goodbye
Play with fire just one more time

For every thing that love could bring you brought me
Each tender love-word you happened to say
Is hidden away

The tenderness that your caresses taught me
You made a million dreams come true and so I'm saying
 Thanks a million to you

Randy Sandke,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love","In a Mist, Candlelight [Bonus Track]",1993

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1994

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?

I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make

Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

came in through the window 
in the night when 
the moon was in the yard. 
He took her hand in his 
and shook the long hair 
from his neck and he told her 
she'd been working much too hard. 
It was true that ever since the day 
her crazy man had passed away 
to the land of poet's pride, 
she laughed and talked alot 
with new people on the block 
but always at evening time she cried. 

And here's to the dawn of their days. 

She moved her head 
a little down on the bed 
until it rested softly on his knee. 
And there she dropped her smile 
and there she sighed awhile, 
and told him all the sadness 
of those years that numbered three. 
Well you know I think my fate's belated 
because of all the hours I waited 
for the day when I'd no longer cry. 
I get myself to work by eight 
but oh, was I born too late, 
and do you think I'll fail 
at every single thing I try? 

And here's to the dawn of their days.

and that's the way I found her 
eight months later to the day.

the tear tracks upon her face,

Good morning, America, how are you?
Say, don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Dealin' card games with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't nobody keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor
And the sons of pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their daddy's magic carpet make of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Good morning, America, how are you?
Say don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Nighttime on the city of New Orleans
Changin' cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Halfway home and we'll be there by mornin'
Thru the Mississippi darkness rollin' down to the sea
But all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings that song again
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearin' railroad blues

Good morning, America, how are you?
Say, don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Randy Scruggs,"The last time I thought about leavin'
Was the last time I made her cry
I talked myself out of believin'
That true, true love never dies

The first time I thought of returnin'
Was just ten lonesome miles out of town
But my foolish pride kept these wheels a-turnin'
Yeah, there was nothin' on this earth gonna shut me down

But if I had one drop of water
For each and every tear that I have cried
I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow
True, true love never dies

Well, the fires of anger turn to ashes
Your pride will forsake you by and by
The lonesome is not surely passin'

Randy Scruggs,"I will twine and will mingle my raven black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with an emerald hue
The pale emanita and hyssop so blue
Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower
A blossom to cheer him through life's weary hour
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
He left me no warning no words of farewell
I will dance I will sing and my life shall be gay
I will charm every heart in the crowd I will sway
Though my heart is now breaking he never shall know
How his name makes me tremble my pale cheeks to glow
Oh, he taught me to love him and promised to love
And cherish me over all others above
Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour
He's gone and neglected this frail wildwood flower

And your car sitting on gold, and how much you get at shows

You need to get off them rocks, and get on private yachts

Pockets get fatter, then a only makes them say matter
Squash all the chatter in the southern region
I pledge of allegiance to my niggas not breathing
We all still breathing screaming S.U.C.
And that's the story mafios, and P-A-T

Poppi in the gray lay with the with the fifth on the back of the lac
You know we ride chrome everyday
Having the ghetto dreams like my nigga P-A
We crossed inside and forever we glide
And one thing's for sure man southside's riding
Let's get this cheddar, you got your wood and your leather
Sitting tall on boys pushing dubs or better
This a click full of g's, so we do it with these
Keep the block on pop and the ice on freeze

We gone ride gray or peanut butter buck eyed
Then we gone tip toe, so slow
We gone wreck the slab for the dirty third coast
Hell we gone post up, on the lot

Fifth drop screens lit, trunk pop
Stash spot, cash box, on vogue socks
Old shoes chrome laces giving haters blues
Banging what Screw, tell me what it do
Shocking and rocking club and the thug and staying true

I'ma do my thug thang, bang bang, chitty, chitty chop
With the stash unlocked, trunks staying hot
HA, green sticky la, deep in the shop
Cardiac kicking times

It's a party baby bounce, bounce sugar hit the flo'
I'm on the cool up in the fo', in the newest Gucci clothes
'Bout to drop it to the door, baguettes touching my navel
Body rocking kinda slutty, served out like label

We got, a stable full of pop
That dish the satellite and throw cable at the spot
Up on the table if it's able to get wet like a mop
And after we wreck the spot we can just ride

Let me see your hands raise, if you playa made

I'ma put it in your crack, see how you act

If you like it on your knees, you could have it for a snack
I'm a fat mack, in a handy bag with a snub with 'em
Broads like the way the fat mack do his thug thizzel
When I hit 'em with my love then I got 'em

I'ma hit it from the top, I'ma put it in a bottle
I'ma hit it from the back, the big black Casanova
I'ma put it in your head and I'ma set it on your shoulders
Syrup in the soda, talking bout the Barre

Foreigner car, feeling like a fallen star
'Bout the menage 'tois ain't that what that Pokey said
Never been scared, South side will leave you dead
And call me Big Meaty, call me Big Meaty

Don't come into my room if you ain't gone get freaky
Working on his boys, run through em like a tractor
Out the South side, Moe-Yo make the god damn adapter
I ain't even quit, I'm doing mighty fast

Sitting on glass, Moe-Yo showing my naked ass
It's the Moe-Yo freestyle I'm so throed
South side playa putting it down, cho-cho
Playas get chosen, like M O E

Put it in your middle yes the big body
Riding big tractor, I'm a money stacker
Out the South side Moe-Yo I'm kinda actor
Act a damn fool, on this damn tape

Affiliated with the game, sitting inches from the ground, now I'm holding
Rolling, want up in the lane
How I come from nothing to going back with change
Pitching the game, knowing that I got another chance
To be, fronting on dubs, stretched shirt down pants
Now I alert why'all to the dance floor, I clap hands
Doing what I want in my 64 with people saying

Searchin' for a shrine he's never found

Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home.

He has tasted good and evil in your bedrooms and your bars,
And he's traded in tomorrow for today
Runnin' from his devils, lord, and reachin' for the stars,
And losin' all he's loved along the way
But if this world keeps right on turnin' for the better or the worse,

I swear I felt the magic from the start
I see the promise of a legendary love

Randy Sparks,"My name is Juanano de Castro
My father was a Spanish Grandee
But I won my wife in a card game
To hell with those lords o'er the sea

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

I played in a card game at Jolon
I played there with an outlaw named Juan
And after I'd taken his money
I staked all against his daughter Dawn
I picked up the ace...l had won her
My heart it was down at my feet
Jumped up to my throat in a hurry
Like a young summer's day she was sweet
He opened the door to the kitchen
And he called the girl out with a curse
Saying ""Take her, Goddamn her, you've won her
She's yours now for better or worse""
Her arms had to tighten around me
As we rode down the hills to the south
Not a word did I hear from her that day
Nor a kiss from her pretty young mouth
But that was a gay happy winter
We carved on a cradle of pine
By the fire in that neat little cabin
And I sang with that gay wife of mine

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

That night I got hurt in a landslide
Crushed hip and twice broken bone
She saddled her pony like lightning
And rode off for the doctor in Cholon
The lion screamed in the Barranca
Buck, he bolted and he fell on his side
My young wife lay dead in the moonlight
My heart died that night with my bride

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

He asked me was I happy as I reached for the butter knife
I said no and I made a sandwich, I poured myself a cup of tea
When that cat started prayin' the spirit fell on me

I got up to use the bathroom, I said excuse me please
But I couldn't help from laughin' and I felt shaky in the knees
As I leaned against the mirror my heart let out a sigh
Like somethin' heavy left me and I opened up my eyes

I can see I am free and I'm who I wanna be
Mercy me, mercy me, mercy me
Mercy me

I was born in dusty Stockton and I grew up in San Jose
But I never started livin' until I learned to pray
Now my parents they ignore me, they say I've gotten strange
But when you're touched by heaven you know something's bound to change

I can see I am free and I'm who I want to be
Mercy me, mercy me, mercy me
Well, I can see I am free and I'm who I want to be
Mercy me, mercy me, mercy me, yes, yes

But I can see I can be free now
I can be me, I wanna be now

you look into my eyes and lie those pretty lies
and pretty soon I'm wond'rin how I came to doubt you.

All you gotta do is smile that smile
and there go all my defenses.
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
you're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses.

Randy Thornton,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know

I set it on the table and I talked to it till four.
I read some old love letters right up to the break of dawn.
Yeah, I've been sittin' alone, diggin' up bones.

Then I went through the jewelry and I found our wedding rings.
I put mine on my finger and I gave yours a fling
Across this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home.
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones.

I'm diggin' up bones, I'm diggin' up bones,
Exhuming things that's better left alone.
And I'm resurrecting mem'ries of a love that's dead and gone.
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones.

And I went through the closet and I found some things in there,
Like that pretty lingerie that I bought you to wear.
And I recalled how good you looked each time you had it on.
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones.

I'm diggin' up bones, I'm diggin' up bones,

Of you and me and the kids

But I wound up in jail on Christmas day
I told her I'd be home and not to worry 'bout my brothers

When the sea don't reach the shore
When the fires of hell freeze over

But I'm not sure that I'm still over you

That lie that I tried to slip by you was told with good intentions
It was just another way to say I love you and protect you from the truth

She was more than just a lover and a friend
I was just too blind to see
And now she set me free
So it's best to walk away and let it end

Back when her sweet love was growing like wine
I wish she'd come back and love me again 
The way that she loved me in that old 8x10

Back at home in bed she's crying
For her love for me is dying
But she'll pry I make it safely through the night
When the mornin' sun starts showing 
To her bedside I'll be going
And she'll hold me while I face the morning light 

And I'll make promises 
Promises to change 
I'll make her promises swear I'll rearrange 
And I'll start giving all the love she needs 
If only she will stay
Once again she'll reassure me and 
I believe her love will cure me
And I'll fall asleep with tears on my face
Lord I know she's just a woman 
And her love can't last forever
And someday soon I know she'll 
Leave without a trace

Will tear her dreams apart
Just token promises will someday break her heart

Two names on a stone together
Lying side by side forever

On something that would be around

Won't fit the gift I'm givin'
Your loving arms will have to do

At first I thought of giving you a pretty golden ring
Wore myself out shopping for a million other things
Finally decided on something you can't buy
But how will I disguise it so you will be surprised?

How do I wrap my heart up for christmas?
I want to give it to you
Pretty bows and ribbons
Won't fit the gift I'm givin'
Your loving arms will have to do

The gift of love was given to the world so long ago
Lying in a manger he was wrapped in swaddling clothes
Every year we celebrate and thank the Lord above
And give to one another our little gifts of love

Not a creature is stirring except for my heart
This old house without you just don't feel right
Oh, what a silent night

Then in the twinklin' of my eye
A teardrop comes fallin' as I realize
I'm all alone and you're by his side
Oh, what a silent night

Your stockin' are hangin' across our old bed
As visions of yesterdays dance in my head
The fire burns hotter but I'm cold as ice
Oh, what a silent night

Randy Travis,"Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write ?I love you?
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue

Crowded street, busy feet hustle by him
Downtown shoppers, Christmas is nigh
There he sits all alone on the sidewalk
Hoping that you won't pass him by

Should you stop?, better not, much too busy
You're in a hurry, my how time does fly
In the distance the ringing of laughter
And in the midst of the laughter he cries

Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write ?I love you?

I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon as only they can

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that as part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn till it was worn into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the Southland gave birth to the blues",Birth of the Blues,1990

Comparing the value, appraising each pair

Bond hair like a halo around her did flow
But the brunette beside her would be just as lovely

After all these years i can still hear grandpa laughin'

He passed his wisdom down to me

I remember my first crush was on the preacher's daughter
We were smoochin' on the front porch swing that night when he caught her
We weren't expectin' him home until quarter past ten
When the good Lord taught me that lesson again
You don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive

And you don't drink no you don't drink when you drive

And that cowboy saw you wink at her,she was a cutie

there is nothing they can't do.
Giving shelter to the homeless,
giving hope to those without,
is'nt that what this land all about.

One by one, from the mountain to the see,
point's of light, are calling out for you and me.

Home it takes 
it's a point of light
a ray of hope 
in the darkest night
if you see what's wrong 
and you try to make it right
You will see a point of light

If you see what's wrong
and you try to make it right
You will be
a point of light.

Every time I look at her my knees get weak
First time I tried to take her on my knee
She took after me with a singletree

Chickens won't lay and the cow's gone dry
Creek's dried up, I can't go fishin'

Said ""Keep Out"" I couldn't read that sign
Gun went off and I started to run
Left that watermelon in the sun

What fun it is to ride and sing a sleigh song tonight

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bell swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in jingle bell square

To go riding in a one-horse sleigh

Randy Travis,"Operator, please connect me with 1982
I need to make apologies for what I didn't do
I sure do need to tell her that I've thought the whole thing through
And now its clear that she is what I should have held on to

[Chorus]
They say hindsight's twenty-twenty
But I'm nearly goin' blind
From starin' at her photograph and wishing she was mine
Its that same ole lost love story
Its sad but its true
There was a time when she was mine in 1982

Postman can you sell me a special kind of stamp
One to send a letter from this crazy lonely man
Back into the wasted years of my living past
I need to tell her now I know how long my love will last

Randy Travis,"Well I've heard those city singers singin' 'bout how they can love
Deeper than the oceans higher than the stars above
Well I come from the country and I know I ain't seen it all
But I heard that oceans salty and the stars they sometimes fall
But that would not do justice to the way I feel for you
So I have to sing this song about all the things I knew

My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of the whippoorwill

From the back roads to the Broadway shows with a million miles between
There's a least a million love songs that people love to sing
And everyone is different and everyone's the same
So this is just another way of sayin' the same thing

My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of the whippoorwill

My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers

And longer than the song of the whippoorwill",Deeper Than the Holler,1992

And in weakness did let your love down
I have prayed that with time and compassion

And you keep saying you can't even start
And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown
To the hard rock bottom of your heart
To the hard rock bottom of your heart

Now this home we have built is still standing
Its foundation is on solid ground
Do we roll up our sleeves and repair it
Or burn it down

Your heroes will help you find good in yourself
Your friends won't forsake you for somebody else
They'll both stand beside you through thick and through thin
And that's how it goes with heroes and friends

I grew up with cowboys I watched on tv
My friends and I sometimes pretended to be
Years have gone by but now and again
My heart rides the range with my heroes and friends

Honky tonk moon, keeps shining on my baby and me

Trouble seems to melt away,
My heart's on a roll, I'm easy in my soul
There's no hurry, no worry, things are goin' my way

My arms around my baby, shufflin' on the floor
Cigarettes and saw-dust, squeaky old screen door.
Honky tonk moon, keeps shinin' on my baby and me.

Outside the dark is falling, stars are twinkling bright

And it's killing me to be so far away
Would you tell my that you love me too

And would we cry together
Or would you simply laugh at me and say


I told you so, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawling back
And asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I've found somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again

If I got down on my knees
And told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand
Would we get that old-time feeling

Would we laugh and talk for hours
The way we did when our love first began
Would you tell me that you've missed me too
And that you've been so lonely

And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live and love forever
And that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned

And would you say

I told you so, I told you so

But I gained a lot, and that I don't regret.
Then I hung around 'till you said ""I do""

And it changed your name.

Lost in the rain of a hurricane,
And that's where I'd have been.

But I didn't get lost cause I saw your light
Shining like a beacon on a cold dark night
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue
No I wouldn't have nothing

If I didn't have you
Well I count my blessings every night I pray
That the lord lets me keep you just one more day
And every day he does cause God knows too

And hold you close to me, all night long.
So many lover's games I could play with you
And on that hand I see no reason why it's wrong

But on the other hand, There's a golden band
To remind of someone who would not understand
On one hand I could stay and be your loving man
But the reason I must go is on the other hand

In your arms I feel the passion, I thought had died
When I looked into your eyes I found myself
When I first kissed your lips I felt so alive

To lay sound asleep by my side
The bills they are mounting that's when I start counting 
On someone to help sooth my pride

A lady that knows me affection she shows me and a smile so easy and sweet
The dreams that I've buried the load that I've carried

And he'd sit in the shade and watch the chickens peck

He could handle a rope and he was good with a gun
And my mama's daddy was his oldest son,
And I thought that he walked on water

If the story was told, only heaven knows
But his hat seemed to me like an old halo
And although his wings, they were never seen
I thought that he walked on water

Then he tied a cord to the end of a mop,
And said, ""son, here's a pony, keep her at a trot""
And I'd ride in circles while he laughed a lot
Then I'd flop down beside him

And he was ninety years old in sixty-three
And I loved him and he loved me
And lord, I cried the day he died,

This up-town living's really got me down
I need friends who don't pay their bills on home computers

You think it's disgraceful that they drink three-dollar wine
But a better class of loser suits me fine

From where I stand I can't see grass at all
And the concrete and the steel won't change the way you feel

Randy Travis,"On the top shelf in the closet,
In the workshop where he spent his extra time
Was a dust wooden box that I had never noticed till that time
And we set on the table and carefully, we opened up the top
And stared into the memory
Daddy kept inside the box
 
There was a letter from mamma, when she went out to Reno
To help her sister out in 62
And a flower from Hawaii, when they went on vacation
It was the first time that my Daddy ever flew
 
And the pocket knife I gave to him on Fathers day
Years ago, I thought it had been lost
We all thought his heart was made from solid rock
But that was long before we found the box
 
I guess we always knew it_but ""I love you"" was hard for him to say
Some men show it easy and some just never seem to find the way
But that night I began to see the softer side of some I had lost
I saw the love he kept inside the first time we opened up the box
 
There was a picture that was taken,when he and Mom were dating
Standing by his 1040 Ford and the faded leather Bible, he got when he was baptized
I guess no one understood him like the Lord
 
And the poem that he had written, about his wife and children
The tender words he spoke were quite a shock
 
We all thought his heart was made of solid rock
But that was long before we found the box
Yes that was long before we found the box",The Box,1994

Randy Travis,"Oscar was an angel and he used to walk the streets
Shoutin' out some prophecy to everyone he'd meet
He was a local fixture like a cop out on a beat
Folks said he'd been shell-shocked long ago
And more than that, no one seemed to know

Oscar was a walker, at least four miles twice a day
The entire length of main street he'd be shoutin' all the way
And I had no idea where he'd heard the things, he'd say
But he was not your normal voice of doom
It was a happy song, sung slightly out of tune

And he'd say, ""Everyone will die and go to heaven
And we will all be angels some day
What you are in this world don't count for nothin'
'Cause we are only children, we're just lost along the way
But we will all be angels some day""

Well I worked at the Rial to, I sold tickets at the door
And Oscar he'd come by most ev'ryday 'bout half past four
And he'd pay to see some movie that he'd seen ten times before
But mostly we'd just let him in for free
And he'd watch five minutes, then he'd come and talk to me

And he'd say, ""Everyone will die and go to heaven
And we will all be angels some day
What you are in this world don't count for nothin'
'Cause we are only children, we're just lost along the way
But we will all be angels some day""

Well it's going on ten years now since I left my home town
And I went home last summer; for a week I hung around
I looked out for Oscar, he was nowhere to be found
Someone said they finally had to commit him
And he died, before they had time to forget him

Now I'm not about to argue, Oscar's train had jumped the tracks
But I'll bet my last dollar on a plain and simple fact
Oscar never said a word about me behind my back
And the way that I was raised to understand
Well, that bone, makes him the better man

And he'd say, ""Everyone will die and go to heaven
And we will all be angels some day
What you are in this world don't count for nothin'
'Cause we are only children, we're just lost along the way
But we will all be angels some day""

Ya, we will all be angels someday

To ever make me make you go away
Would I
Would I

Randy Travis,"They say that once the new wears off
The test of love begins
When the spark that lit the fire won't burn
As bright as it once did
If lovers lose that old desire
Hearts can break in two
The hard work starts when it ain't nothin' new

Chorus
It ain't nothin' new but after all this time
This love of ours still hasn't lost its shine
It's makin' up when we've been mad that I look forward to
Even though it ain't nothin' new

Now love don't come as easy as once it did and so
Sometimes we seem to say the things that cut and hurt the most
But then we pull together and somehow see it through
That's what it takes when it ain't nothin' new

Chorus 
",It Ain't Nothin' New,1996
Randy Travis,"I remember how it used to feel
Riding down old two mile hill
Tennis shoes up on the handle bars
Paying no mind to the passing cars
No doubts, no fears, just like when you are here

No chains, no strings, no fences, no wall
No net, just you to catch me when I fall
Look heart, no hands.

It took a little time to get up to speed
To find the confidence and strength I need
To just let go and reach for the sky
You Know sometimes it felt I could fly.
No doubts, no fears, just like when you are here.

No chains, no strings, no fences, no wall
No net, just you to catch me when I fall
Look heart, no hands.

It doesn't take much, just a smile or a touch
And I'm a kid again, I can almost feel that wind

On one hand I count the reasons I could stay with you
And hold you close to me, all night long.
So many lover's games I could play with you
And on that hand I see no reason why it's wrong

No chains, no strings, no fences, no wall
No net, just you to catch me when I fall
Look heart, no hands.

But on the other hand, there's a golden band
To remind of someone who would not understand
On one hand I could stay and be your loving man
But the reason I must go is on the other hand

In your arms I feel the passion, I thought had died
When I looked into your eyes I found myself
When I first kissed your lips I felt so alive
I've got to hand it to you girl, you're something else

No chains, no strings, no fences, no wall
No net, just you to catch me when I fall
Look heart, no hands.","Look Heart, No Hands",1997

But only for the job I choose to do
And what part helps me through my darkest hours,
Each mile brings me closer to you

Please believe you're all I ever wanted
If you should leave I don't know what I'd do
I'd be like a child afraid of darkness
The greatest fear I have is losing you

Heaven knows I've always had these demons
watchin for a place to take control
Whispering you'll never be there for me
Waiting at the end of my road

I set it on the table and I talked to it till four
I read some old love letters right up to the break of dawn
Yeah, I've been sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

Then I went through the jewelry and I found our wedding rings
I put mine on my finger and I gave yours a fling
Across this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

I'm diggin' up bones, I'm diggin' up bones,
Exhuming things that's better left alone
And I'm resurrecting mem'ries of a love that's dead and gone
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

And I went through the closet and I found some things in there,
Like that pretty lingerie that I bought you to wear
And I recalled how good you looked each time you had it on
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

I'm diggin' up bones, I'm diggin' up bones,

Though I know when I fall 
Another whip is coming 
When I feel my body going down 
And there's nothing I can do 
I know if I keep my faith in you 
I'm gonna make it through 

I'm a prisoner here in this hall of kings 
I'm gold I'm jewels I'm a diamond ring

The law says I'm their property 
But my heart and my soul belong to me 
They can hold me but I'll never be in their possession

Give them faith to follow me

Skin as soft as a petal, of an uncut rose

Right down to the pedestal, I put you on

I knew everything had changed
But it ain't so simple for a man
Whose whole world he has to rearrange

You just couldn't find in me
Baby I love you so much
But I guess I'll have to set you free
And it was so easy to love you

To ease this pain and take my pride

Laid open wide

Of all I have to do
My life will never be the same
Not like it was with you

Said I'm gonna tunnel me a line

Down to dark to see the gold
Now he won't let go of the shovel
And he can't dig out of the hole

Deeper and deeper
he's goin' down
Drivin' his future right into the ground
He thinks he's closer
The further he goes
But he's still on the bottom
And he can't dig out of the hole

I tried to throw the man a lifeline
I tried to send him down a rope
I don't think he hears me callin'
But every day I pray and i hope
Somehow he finally gets the message
Every spade of dirt he throws
Only gets him closer to the devil
And he can't dig out of the hole

[Chorus]

Maybe we could learn a little lesson
Maybe this could shine a little light
there's no healthy way to mess with
The line between a wrong and a right
Use the one chance you've been given
Cause once you're in the ground and cold
Its too late to start livin'
See you can't dig out of the hole

And your parachute won't open

It's kinda like a heartache, only worse

It wasn't my first brush with love
But this one was the deepest

Swore I'd never get hurt again
But here I am in pieces

To cure me from loving you

Keep walkin' till my temperature drops
Keep walkin' until the fever is gone
And you're out of my bones

I'm in need of medicine
Something strong that will work real fast
That I can take to fortify me
To keep my arms from taking you back
Chase that ghost out from under my bed
Still daylight till dawn
Till you're out of my bones

Sweet amnesia
Come and set me free
I just need to
Get you out of me

Carry your picture in my shoe

Randy Travis,"Many more miles were behind him 
Than he had left to go
Closing in upon that last one 
We all must walk alone
It's the one across the end of the line
So we held on and we told stories
Of the good and bad in all
Of the power and the glory 
And the lonely days that crawled
And he said, ""Heaven holds true love
And a satisfied mind.""

He said, ""I ain't afraid of dying
'Cause I know there's something worse:
When you have to see your reason for living go first,
And you get left behind.
Some can't think of nothing better
Than to live this life forever.
I never wanted no more than was mine,
And to lay down someday and go home
With a satisfied mind.""

He said, ""Don't look into the darkness.
If you want to see true black,
Look into a morning's brightness
When love ain't coming back,
And you will find right there a darkness that blinds.
And don't think wealth is ever having
All you want all to yourself;
It is found when you are giving
What you have to someone else
The only difference in the rich and the poor
Is a satisfied mind.""

She was too, and he'd do anything to prove his love.
With so much riding on the choice at hand,

Hearts caught fire and love ran wild.
She cried the day she called to say she was having his child.
With so much riding on the choice at hand,

There's a constant contradiction, what feels good and what feels right.
But, you live with decisions that you make in your life.
And what steers your direction is hard to understand,

Randy Travis,"The summer breeze, made ripples on the pond
Rattled through the rings and the willow trees beyond
Daddy in his good hat, mama in her Sunday dress
Watched in pride, as I stood there in the water up to my chest
And the preacher spoke about the cleansing blood
I sank my toes into that East Tennessee mud

And it was down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
But I felt like a new baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord

Amazing grace, oh how sweet the sound
There was glory in the air, there was dinner on the ground
And my sins went for many, were washed away and gone
Along with a buffalo nickel I forgot to leave at home
But that seemed like such a small, small price to pay
For the blessed peace of mind that came to me that day

And it was down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
But I felt like a new baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord

This road is long and dusty, sometimes the soul must be cleansed
And I long to feel that water, rushing over me again

Down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
But I felt like a new baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord
I felt like a newborn baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord",Baptism,1999
Randy Travis,"Amazing grace! How sweet the sound!
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believed!

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come.
Tis grace that brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

He learned from his father at a very early age
There was something special in the man
There was much more to his life

That would match the one you'd find, when you leave this world behind
If you only took the time""

Treat your brother like a friend
Always turn the other cheek
Help the weary and the weak
Make the time for young and old
And as your life unfolds
Each kindness that you've shown
Will be the nails and hammers 
As you build your final ladder 
In the manner of the carpenter of old 

You could feel compassion in his eyes
Only fools that hurt him did not realize
That he was speaking to us all
The righteous and the mighty
The silent and the small

Bathe me in a river of my tears
Whisper hope and truth and courage in my ears
Remind me when I reach the other side
I'll be thankful for every tear that I cried

Don't let me grow bitter I pray
Give me strength to carry on my way
Don't let the darkness drive me insane

Randy Travis,"Daddy never went to church on Sunday
He said that's one thing I'll never do
But mama never gave up she said one day
He'll be sitting here beside of me and you
I can still hear mama softly talking
With her tears falling on her folded hands
So that Easter Sunday Daddy walked in
That's when I began to understand

When mama prayed, good things happen
When mama prayed, lives were changed
Not much more than five foot tall
But mountains big and small crumbled all away
When mama prayed

Seventeen and wild I hit the bottle
Doing anything I dang well please
Burning down life's highway at full throttle
While mama burned a candle on her knees
Then one night I came home half sober
I saw mama kneeling in the den
As I listened she and Jesus talked it over
And I knew my restless days were 'bout to end

When mama prayed, good things happen
When mama prayed, lives were changed
Not much more than five foot tall
But mountains big and small crumbled all away
When mama prayed

It isn't like every one of them got answered
But the times they weren't it seems to me were rare
You almost felt sorry for the devil
'Cause heaven knows he didn't have a prayer
When mama prayed

Not much more than five foot tall
But mountains big and small crumbled all away
When mama prayed
They crumbled all away
When mama prayed

You'd come around

I keep waiting for you to forgive me
And you keep saying you can't even start
And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown
To the hard rock bottom of your heart
To the hard rock bottom of your heart

Now this home we have built is still standing
It's foundation is on solid ground
Do we roll up our sleeves and repair it
Or burn it down

And told you that I love you
And suppose I said I want to come back home

And I'm tired of spending all my time alone
If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killing me to be so far away
Would you tell my that you love me too

And would we cry together
Or would you simply laugh at me and say...

[Chorus]
I told you so, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawling back
And asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I've found somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again

If I got down on my knees
And told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand
Would we get that old-time feeling

Would we laugh and talk for hours
The way we did when our love first began
Would you tell me that you've missed me too
And that you've been so lonely

And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live and love forever
And that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned
And would you say...

I'm no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live, this love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die

I felt weak inside
I searched my heart and mind
For words I couldn't find
Somehow you seemed to see
What came over me that night
As a love began to grow
That would last for all time

And you said,
I can see it in your eyes
They're the windows to your soul
Sometimes they say more
Than words could ever hold
We could wait a thousand lifetimes
And never feel like this again
But when you look at me that way
I can see it in your eyes

Later on I asked your hand
And I prayed the time was right
I knelt down on one knee
And said would you be my bride?
And the sound of silence
Filled the air
As your tears fell with mine
You didn't have to say a word
For me to realize

And I said,
I can see it in your eyes
They're the windows to your soul
I see dreams come alive
And future plans unfold
I could wait a thousand lifetimes
And not find a perfect love again
But when you look at me that way
I can see it in your eyes

Many years have come and gone
And what a life we've made
How again we search for words
As the heart inside me breaks
Until death do we part
Were the vows we made
And now the time has come
But goodbye is so hard to say

I can see it your eyes
They're the windows to your soul
The light of life is burning low
Soon you're leaving me I know
The time that's left is precious dear
So please don't shed another tear

And I can't say she's wrong for wanting more

The anger deep in your heart
You're the only one that it's hurting

He broke all his promises too

When all of your best played plans
Hit the wall of reality

I've seen em all day long from 4am till noon
Some are running from
Some are running too
Some are running blind

I said I got a plan you see I got it figured out
How can you be so sure my dear what I'm all about

I can tell your brand of beer

us a tank of gas
And some Redman tobacco
when we were just teenage kids
Me and my old buddy Leroy,
we'd go driving around
If there was trouble to be found,
then man we dang sure did
Cutting doughnuts in the fields
'Till old man Smith would call the cops
He'd come runnin' out with a shotgun cause we were runnin' down his crops
And I reckon he's still wonderin' who that was
But that was us

Now some of these old local boys moved on
but we never changed a bit
Never had a lick of sense, least that's what
some folks said
Then finally we turned old enough to buy our
own beer
Don't remember much about that year,
just lucky we ain't dead

'Cause somebody said they saw some boys
With a truck looked just like mine
Tryin' to pull down that old water tank
That sits out on the country line
And people wonder why it leans the way it does
That was us

Seems like small towns never change
But things get tough when times get hard
And they said when he got sick
Old man Smith would've lost the farm
'Cause he was getting' way behind on all his bills
'Till somebody brought his crops in from the fields

that was

But on the other hand, there's a golden band

A long time ago, Lazarus died

All hope seemed gone as his sisters cried

Jesus walked to where he laid

He called his name and he came out of the grave


Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory?

you thought you had a hold on me but you were wrong, I?ve been set free


Oh, jesus hung on a rugged cross, he gave His life for a world once lost

He lay three days in a borrowed grave but when He came out I could hear Him say


Oh death, where thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory?

You thought you had a hold on me but you were wrong, I?ve been set free


One day I?ll lay this body down, they?ll dress me up and put me in the ground

But when Jesus comes in the sky, just listen close and you?ll hear me cry


Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory?

And that's when my frustration gets so out of hand.
It's then I am reminded, I've never been forsaken.
I've never had to stand one test alone.
As I look at all the victories, the Spirit rises up in me.
And It's through the fire my weakness is made strong.

He never promised that the cross would not get heavy
And the hill would not be hard to climb.
He never offered a victory without fighting.
He said help would always come in time.
Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision
And the advisory says give in, Just hold on.
Our Lord will show up (Yeah)
And He will take you through the fire again

I know within myself that I would surly perish
If I trust the hand of God, He'll shield the flame again.

That lie that I tried to slip by you
Was told with good intentions
It was just another way to say I love you

And trying to explain while I'm insane
Is the hardest thing I've ever tried to do

Ridin' on a midnight bus bound for Mexico
One's headed for vacation, one for higher education
An' two of them were searchin' for lost souls
That driver never ever saw the stop sign
An' eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

That farmer left a harvest, a home and eighty acres
The faith an' love for growin' things in his young son's heart
An' that teacher left her wisdom in the minds of lots of children
Did her best to give 'em all a better start
An' that preacher whispered: ""Can't you see the Promised Land?""
As he laid his blood-stained bible in that hooker's hand

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows

It's what you leave behind you when you go

That's the story that our preacher told last Sunday
As he held that blood-stained bible up

He said: ""Bless the farmer, and the teacher, an' the preacher
""Who gave this Bible to my mamma
""Who read it to me""

Coming out of Caroline

We wondered what you were haulin'

More than once or twice

Under the neon lights

Is the best that I have found

In our kind of songs
About the life you're living
And how love's done you wrong

But when that happens
You must shake off those blues
Just remember you've got nothing to lose
But you've had true love since the day you were born
Since the day you were born

Then she told me all she knew
About what makes true love true
And it hasn't much to do with heat
Young hearts race and then grow still
Passion cools and always will
But a river just keeps filling up the sea

You see love is a gamble
It's a chance that you take
You lay your heart down
And you bet it won't break
You bet your sweet dreams
Won't get tattered and torn
But when that happens
You must dream up some more
When you find it you'll have seen it before
But you've had true love
Since the day you were born

Love is a gamble
It's a chance that you take
To lay your heart down
And you bet it won't break
You bet your sweet dreams
Won't get tattered and torn
But when that happens
You must shake off those blues
And just remember you got nothing to lose
You've had true love
Since the day you were born
Since the day you were born",Love Is a Gamble,2008
Randy Travis,"Your hand was wrapped around th ebottle
Your arm wrapped around her waist
You were running at full throttle
Big smile across your face

You were the life of the party
But it was all in your mind
I hate to be the one to tell you
You didn't have a good time

well I bet you don't remember
Kneeling in that bathroom stall
Praying for salvation 
And cursing out the hall

The you went right back to drinking 
Like everything was fine
But let's be honest with each other 
You didn't have a good time

[Chorus]
So take a good hard look in the mirror
And drink that image down
I'm the truth you can't run from
I'm the conscious you can't grind
And the happiness you want so bad 
You ain't going to find
Until you start believing
You didn't have a good time

When you woke up this morning
I guess you just assumed
That you got something out of
The empty bottles in this room

There ain't an angel that can save you
When you're listening to the wise
And the demons they won't tell you 
You didn't have a good time

Oh, why can't I make them shine like before?

But now I doubt what the outcome will be
I pray you'll say I'm the one you adore

For an old black lady who was walkin’ in the store

I saw a homeless man pull a dollar from his shoe
Slip it in the plate as it was passin’ down the pew
And I wondered, I couldn't help but wonder, was it the last he had

Oh, I believe that love’s alive and well
Though the way things are these days
Some say it’s hard to tell

And I've seen one little candle
Keep away the darkness all by itself
And that’s the reason why
I know love’s alive and well

They’d been together sixty-three years
Still they smile at each other and their eyes fill up with tears
Ain't that something, but ain't that how it's supposed to be

With no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad,
So I had one more for dessert.
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt.
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day.

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and the songs I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way.

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone.

With a laughin' little girl who he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singin'
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed thru the canyon 
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday.

I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned

That makes a body feel alone.

Get your favorite one to sit by your side

They ski down a hill that's a snowplow turn
And look there's a spill
There's a spill on the hill 
When you're down it's a thrill to go up again.

Ev'rybody ought to learn to ski for that is how we first met
We were that Jack and Jill that came down a hill,
When I looked at you my hearttook a spill

that you nearly passed me by

I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

For the sake of havin' you near

As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you

Randy Weston,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining

Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember

Randy Weston,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,1956
Randy Weston,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1956

Ranee Lee,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1994

For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",The Trolley Song,1994

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

That lived within the heart of me

Became impatient to be free

The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,

But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.

Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

If I should die

Don't cry my niggas it's been one hell of a ride my niggas
In the middle of the trial I flip pies my niggas
I did joints with Mary J. Blige my niggas
I've eluded the coppers got booted with Big Poppa
Skated through with the Ceasar Picadas
At high school got head by the lockers
Gassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers
Rocked jewels dropped school still didn't fail
Rhymes still written well hold court in the street
Never sit in the cell for a second then I'm gettin' my bail
Shoot it out with the bounty hunters fuck
Sittin' in the county for summers if they should down me
Everybody around us become one for that day

Don't get it twisted like rays if I miss that's ok
But life's short don't miss a day uhh

Had an episode with two lesbians got a fetish for that
Drunk ginseng with Japanese chicks & pulled the root out
Squeeze my whole clip to survive shootouts
Been on both coasts fired all kinds of heat
Probably be kinda glad to leave these mean streets
I got dead mens to meet and questions to fulfill
Like is that mystery God real?
And how was Kennedy killed? I ain't mad
I must've smoked a ton of reefer sipped Coronas
With Latifah broke the code of Geneva
I know when I reach the other side I'ma see the
Cat I had beef with who blood remains on my sneaker
Then it's on again if I could be born again
I live my life through my son
And tell him never have a friend
Just family reincarnated I'll show him the time
That I waited to get paid tell him never be afraid
Niggas hearts pump Kool Aid and yo blood run thicker
Never shed tears cry liquor my nigga

If I die don't cry my niggas
It's been one hell of a ride my niggas
Say word to Wais my niggas
When I'm gone don't mourn my niggas
Just keep bangin' these songs my niggas
Say word is bond my niggas
If I die

Don't cry my niggas
Just stay gettin' high my niggas
Don't wonder why my niggas
When I'm gone live on my niggas
Just follow my path my niggas
Say word to Half my nigga

I'm the aftermath of pleasure never die alone
Born to live forever through life's struggles
I cut corners & took drastic measures
See you niggas life expire right in front of me
Time could never mend what these cold streets
Mentally done to me too often I close my eyes
And see my own coffin feelin' haunted ready to leave
This world that I'm lost in my only chance
To see the seeds I lost through abortion
When I'm gone y'all niggas better not mourn
Keep flossin' as long as my name
Lives on what's most important
I'll be down in hell scorchin' preparin' for life
Afterlife still torchin' & blazin' these mics
It'd rain for 40 days & 40 nights
& I'd return on the 3rd like Christ
Without my physical portion
My spirit a poltergeist for sure
I'll be back through the heist tomorrow
Blood over y'all fake niggas door
What you thought? [huh]
What you thought? [nigga]

If I should die don't cry my niggas
Just stay gettin' high my niggas
Don't wonder why my niggas
When I'm gone live on my niggas
Just follow my path my niggas
Say word to Half my nigga
When I die

Don't cry my niggas
It's been one hell of a ride my niggas
Say word to Wais my niggas
When I'm gone don't mourn my niggas
Just keep gettin it on my niggas
Say word is bond my niggas
If I die

Don't cry my niggas
Just ride my niggas bust bullets in the sky my niggas
And when I'm gone don't mourn my niggas
Get on my niggas when it's real
Say word to Shawn my niggas
If I should die

I'd tell Big they're still hearin' his songs
Run into Pac ask him where we went wrong
Tell him life is miserable when ya dealin' in the physical form
Is everything that's invisible gone?
I need to know will I still feel pain or will it be ironic?
Will I chill in the flames for all the ills of my brain?
Can I reveal the game to all the hustlers
Trapped in the race and if so can I leave this place?
Can I puff cigars & drink Cristal?
If this is heaven to me is this considered heavenly?
Can I still touch lives answer they ""whats & whys""
Make sure everybody in my fam' clutch five?

So I want you start movin', start and I want you to say

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Hear what your brother say, ain't got to contemplate
Fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way
Time is the master, time can be a disaster
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Drop it, drop it, moving on the down
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Ain't no time to play

Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
Ain't no time to play
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run (got no-one to blame but yourself) you missed the starting gun

A tick-a-tick-a-tock, look-a at the clock
Got to move it on the dot, and don't you know because the time is
The time, the time, the time, the time is the master
And time can be a disaster, yeah you know
Got no time to play
The time is the master, huh
And time is the master, yeah
I say you can't change the hands of time
And you could never turn back hands of time
Got no time to play
Got to get on the go and got to move it, right away when I tell you, say we got no time to be late
When I tell you, say whaa
'Cause time is the master
A tick-a-tick-a-tock-a move it on the dot and don't you look back till you could die
See the time, it's a terrible time
'Cause homie say can me say see what's time, yo
Yeah, you know?
Got to know what you understand, is what I want you to say, ain't got no time for me, got no time for delay is what I want you to say
A tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tock, move it on and say a-you could never stop
Got no time to play, I say no time to delay
Move it right away, I never tell you, don't wanna say 'cause this-a time is the master
Time is the master, time can be a disaster, yeah you know?
So you got to move it on the go and don't undertand, a little bit or a load, keep a-coming man go
When I tell you understand what I leave behind, leave for man, suppose I wanna go, she want you to say whaa!

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away, across the field

Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell",Time,2003

Where the fuck's all these niggas saying Ran' isn't hot
I damage the block
I scramble like Randall with rocks
I'm that nigga in the gambling spot
Cracking jokes and drinking liquor
You still gotta hand me your watch
I'm in the kitchen with the pans and the pots
Razor on the plate, trying to figure out how many grams I'm a chop
Family or not, some niggas making plans with the cops
Trying to figure how to make this animal stop
Who these niggas trying to take down
Break down, tray pound, eight rounds
He ain't feeling nothing from the waist down
Hit up, lit up, he never gonna get up
There's only one legend alive
The rest you gotta dig up
You acting like it's hard roast ya
I'll creep in your crib, and put your brains on your Barkley posters
Got no time to be boxing around
I got the ox and the pound
I'll leave you in the box in the ground
Got the keys to the game, and we locking this down
Underwater with the sharks, and we not gonna drown
Got the order from the narcs, they still watching the town
I'm copping a pound
They ain't no stopping us now, my nigga

[Freck Billionaire]
Ya clip trip, clip spit
Get your strip wet
I got the rubber grip Smith and my rich sweats
Player haters talking 'bout they gonna get Freck
I'm in the Lamb' sunk lower than the shipwreck
They call me bar-for-bar 'cause I spit the better lines
The white bitch got rich like Federline
Fuck a g-pack, I'll show you how to read crack
You get it soft and then you rock it like T-Mac
The weed good price, plus it smoke speci
Three thousand full pound of some Dro Pesci
Y'all niggas only talkers
I'll let my homies spark ya
We in the spurs, that's faster than Tony Parker
This is family nigga don't ever cross my brother
Like Big Worm, niggas rather cross their mother
Mention names in my family tree
This nigga talking crazy like insanity plea
I, swear to god, the next nigga I give it to
Is going to a place FedEx can't deliver to
I'm West Philly Freck, yeah I get dirty
I'm the best, hands down, like six-thirty

Look
Like Michael J. Fox, I got +Family Ties+
Posing us can't be wise
Swept across the family dies
Something small as a look, can bring about a man's demise
And whoever he stands beside, hit him where he can't survive
Throw the drop, or slip an object, if not then missing
Nine shot, pop a clip in, pine box the opposition
Put him in formal dress, right hand across the left
No autopsy necessary, determined the cause of death
Six shots across the chest should explain his loss of breath
Skin peeled off your flesh, I know you wish you wore a vest
That's a no brainer, I'm coming with both flamers
I'll spray 'em, but I'm no painter
To this here, I'm no stranger
It's obvious you no bangers
You dudes pose no danger
Your whole crew chumps, in the closet like coat hangers
Like purple broke up in the dutch
Leave you broke up on a crush
That's what happens when shooters choke up in the clutch
We gonna body you, and have to hook your wife to an I.V. too
Put both of your parents side by side in I.C.U (everybody lose)
Closed casket so they can't have a proper wake
Don't interfere with family business, that's how we operate

Yo
Niggas is letting birds turn the tables on they squad
Need help with a jump, got some cables in the car
Cause they all become nondescript
When something bright is on your wrist
Like you repping the bionic six
Who wanna fire, when guns fire, your lungs tire
I'm an idol, niggas is San-jaya, now who wanna try us
That four-five will spit
I'll slump you in the driver seat
And make you really ghost ride the whip
It's real talk, shade niggas couldn't get a tan from me
Cause I get in the ring for that Vince McMahon money
Soon as his un-tuck BAM
Talking about you touch grams
I'm coming through your window something like +Brother Man+
It's just who we are
If I see yar, it's E.R
Vacay in D.R., shirt and jeans, g-star
Tell me how they gonna manage
Letting off Virgina Techs now, dudes ain't even safe on campus
Gotta spaz on cowards

Callouses on my pop finger, pop off nigga
Pop through, throw the drop, kick the lock off dump
'Fore them bodies drop out, six glocks in the trunk
Chef boy supplying, whip whop is drying
When they move that, more whip whop arriving
And my connect from Phoenix, the connect named Phoenix
Still Keep the iron like my right hand anemic
For for the family, I'll be squeezing, no reason

Last seen in Brooklyn, they found in a Bronx lot

We don't fire warning shots, niggas fire on swat
And if they get me, Brooklyn gonna riot on spot
I'm from the hood, so I'm supplying bomb rock

Look, you can't hold nothing, but I got a shell to give

If he heard yet, bet that get the word buzzing

Niece, nephew, they gonna need Tef' too
This'll a go in and out they chest like a breath do
You Clay Aiken-soft
You playing games until this red light's on ya
It's like the Playstation's off
Smith & Wesson work, Luger nine labor
Professional shit like they did me on majors

This is family nigga, do not cross the brothers
I'll put you in the box, one hand across the other
A small price to pay, son, it might cost your mother
One of your grandparents, even your baby brother
Cause everybody knows, everybody goes
I want them in coffins, everybody's closed
Related by the streets, this is family beef
So better not touch a branch on this family tree

I am the silence before the storm Lincoln Park to Audubon

For you broke nigga and gold diggas wit no figga
That's why I palm the heater for all you non believers
I'm on ya ass like white on rice on Condoleezza
Betta con the preacher you tryna get on a feature
Betta get ya casket bastard I'm gon' eat cha
We ain't in the same weight class ya fake ass
Couldn't stop a nigga wit brake pads I'm way pass
Anything that you ever did I'm betta kid
And we never sweat a bid it's easy to get a sig
In the bing I'm like Ving Rhames I bring pain
I sling cane off the wing like I'm King James
Y'all doubtin' who when I spit the whole lead
They be callin' code read like Mountain Dew
'Fore I count to you can get cha back blown
'Cause ya gimmicks out of minutes like a track phone
Get back holmes I'm back on my shit
I don't mangle I'm like Pringles stackin my chips
Clappin' my fifth you the test me types
Comin' out wit a blade and get Wesley Sniped
So the cops could arrest me right it's not happenin'
You ain't never gon' get on so stop rappin'
H2O comin' this summer so stop askin'

Ayo money is the root of evil I thought
But when I'm broke is when I usually have the evilest thoughts
That's when the arms come out like sleeves when it's short
Wit more bullets than ya favorite wide receiver has caught
And that Randy Mossberg ya Steve Smith and Wesson ya
The shoes pop up like instant messenger
You've got mail nah nigga you got shells
And my Mac you can't use for iChat
A guy that confused that will lie flat
And my gat is on leg like thigh tap
I that nigga who you dudes
Some broke niggas who tryna get some youtube views
Unless you wanna point blank boy ya too close
Bails in pocket this is Lawyer Lou Los
I'm pretty sure more hotties see me in that foou door roddie
Double pipes like a sawed off shotty

(Joe Budden)

I flow sickly ridin' bumpin' old biggie
Roll wit me or lose wait Nicole Richie
Fuck plat if I don?t reach diamond fame
Ill treat a nigga face like that old simon game
I figured out why men try us 'cause we o-d on rims and thin tires
For that we Len Bias
All it takes a punch he ain't brave he a punk
I'll put his family in boxes meet the Brady Bunch
How y'all feel y'all selves Shaquille y'all selves
Us cowboys don?t need you you Bill Parcell
And you ain't gotta empty ya pockets when the K's out
Whatever you holdin' is mine you my Paypal
See I don't get how this guy is a treat
I'll make his life a net por pie to the neck
Ride or die or do both nigga ride to the death
I'll acapella the whole left side of his chest
Not retiring still got that pension pendin'
Tryna pop the hood and see the engine messin'
Double barrel shotgun how ya men get missin'
She got pretty brown eyes and she in mint condition
Or the sig in the car you dissin' muah
Get the ratchet go home and just Chris Benoit
I tell a bird like it is you promise the broad
I one line her you Isaiah Thomas the broad
I can send a clip cartridge at a nemesis target
And catch a R.O.R. on some Jena six charges
Nah I put the thing away
I don't even need a whole handle to flip em all it takes is one finger wave
But in the bing for days show you how I'm real
Come home to the truck with the Optimus Prim grille
Handin' out crack got the scene poppin' off
They not sleepin' on 'em the fiends is noddin' off
For real tell me how you a thug and you Superman (Nigga)
I just seen you in the club doing the Superman (I Said Nigga!)
A bunch of clowns holmes all
I need in this world is the pound chrome Huxtable brownstone
Major paper cake by the layers
If these dudes is live I'm the created player
They callin' 'em kings when they so so hot
Somethings wrong wit that picture must be photoshopped
I don't promote violence but when sparking the flame Blam
Arms start waving like the Carlton Banks dance
When them tools go pop it move whole blocks
Come around wit cha dog or get Kujo shot
These emcee's is lame I tryta be an emcee wit brains
These niggas is M.C. Brain
Yeah nice rapper just far from bein' nice
I'm on the rooftop recordin' and niggas is bein' sniped
That's light

So whatever you tryna do lil niggas I already done

Before I pull this curb and start swerving like Baby sis
If he heard yet, bet that get the word buzzing
You send a message when you kill a nigga third cousin
Niece, nephew, they gonna need Tef' too
This'll a go in and out they chest like a breath do
You Clay Aiken-soft
You playing games until this red light's on ya
It's like the Playstation's off
Smith & Wesson work, Luger nine labor
Professional shit like they did me on majors

This is family nigga, do not cross the brothers
I'll put you in the box, one hand across the other
A small price to pay, son, it might cost your mother
One of your grandparents, even your baby brother
Cause everybody knows, everybody goes
I want them in coffins, everybody's closed
Related by the streets, this is family beef
So better not touch a branch on this family tree
