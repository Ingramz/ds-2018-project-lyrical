Everybody telling me “Look out for him”
I’m throwin’ up my hands, I can’t stop
Gettin’ close to the flame, it’s too hot

Been here, and I don’t wanna stay
Prayin’ for my out, gotta get away
Everything I wanna do, I don’t do
Can’t see beyond the past or what’s true

You must have some magnet in your soul
Pullin’ me away from what I know

I betta go, yeah (go-o-o-o-o)
Betta go-o-o , huh
I betta go
(Where there’s fire, there’s smoke, and I’m 'bout to choke)

I betta go (go-o-o-o-o)
Betta go, o-o-oo
I betta go (go-o-o-o-o)
('Cause where there’s fire, there’s smoke, fire, there’s smoke)

All I gotta do, is just turn around
Keep on walkin’, don’t slow it down
No matter what I do I can’t move
You keep winnin’, every time and I lose

You must have some magnet in your soul
Pullin’ me away from what I know

I betta go, yeah (go-o-o-o-o)
Betta go-o-o (o-o)
I betta go huh
I betta go-o

Betta go, o-o-oo
I betta go huh (go-o-o-o-o)
I betta go-o
('Cause where there’s fire, there’s smoke, and I’m 'bout to choke)

I keep on foolin', myself every time
Runnin’ back to you, to you-ou-o
This love is toxic, it’s pullin’ me further from the truth
But you, you-ou-ou

She don’t wanna talk to you
There’s nothing you can say
She gone wait, for something true
There’s nothing you can say

She don’t, wanna talk to you
She gon’ wait, for something true
Mess with her, you face this crew
Nah, she ain’t staying with you

I betta go, yeah (go-o-o-o-o)
Betta go-o-o (o-o)
I betta go, huh
(Where there’s fire, there’s smoke, and I’m 'bout to choke)

I betta go
There’s nothing you can say (I betta go, o-o-oo)
Nothing you can say, (I betta go) ,huh
('Cause where there's fire, there’s smoke, fire, there’s smoke)

There’s nothing you can say (I betta go)
To make me stay (I betta go, o-o-oo)
There’s nothing you can say-ay... (I betta go)

So tell me why, tell me why
We're divided

Woke up today

In the name of hatred
So hard to take (hey!)
And if we think that it's all good
Then we're mistaken
'Cause my heart is breaking (tell it, 'Dis)

Are you right?

Are you black? (black)
Are you white? (white)
Aren't we all the same inside? (the same inside)

What are we fighting for?
We were made to carry one another
We were made for more, said
Only love can drive out all the darkness
What are we fighting for? yeah
We were made to carry one another

You will forgive our sins
And You will heal our incredible land

You start to doubt everything that you know
I feel the heat and it's starting to show

Tod Hildreth,"I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Tod Stewart,"Wake up, Maggie,
I think I got something to say to you.
It's late September and
I really should be back at school.
I know I keep you amused,
But I feel I'm being used.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts.

The morning sun, when it's in your face,
Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.
I laughed at all of your jokes.
My love you didn't need to coax.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face.
You made a first-class fool out of me.
But I'm as blind as a fool can be.
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway.",Maggie May,1997
Tod Vullo,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

You bared your sould I waltzed right in
You gave me everything

You spilled your guts on my best shoes
I keep it in, you let it loose
It's only love that makes you feel like I'm getting
So completely
Naked and you don't remember
How you let yourself become so unraveled
Your naked pretty as a heartache
Waiting for your second skin to settle in

My hardened heart can't hide me now
It loves as much as I allow
And in the end the eyeball army will just drag me down
And I'll be

And I know there's nothing that can hide me now
I'm naked
Nothing but a heartache

Which Jesus do you serve?
If Ephesians says to imitate Christ
Then why do you look so much like the world?

Cause my Jesus bled and died
He spent His time with thieves and liars
He loved the poor and accosted the arrogant
So which one do you want to be?

Blessed are the poor in spirit
Or do we pray to be blessed with the wealth of this land
Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness
Or do we ache for another taste of this world of shifting sand

'Cause my Jesus bled and died for my sins
He spent His time with thieves and sluts and liars
He loved the poor and accosted the rich
So which one do you want to be?

Who is this that you follow
This picture of the American dream
If Jesus was here would you walk right by on the other side or fall down and worship at His holy feet

Pretty blue eyes and curly brown hair and a clear complexion
Is how you see Him as He dies for Your sins
But the Word says He was battered and scarred
Or did you miss that part
Sometimes I doubt we'd recognize Him

'Cause my Jesus bled and died
He spent His time with thieves and the least of these
He loved the poor and accosted the comfortable
So which one do you want to be?

'Cause my Jesus would never be accepted in my church
The blood and dirt on His feet would stain the carpet

I want to be like my Jesus!
I want to be like my Jesus!

Not a posterchild for American prosperity, but like my Jesus
You see I'm tired of living for success and popularity
I want to be like my Jesus but I'm not sure what that means to be like You Jesus

And laid them out before the Lord and demanded a reason for these things
I asked about inequality and the success of evil men

Where were you when I taught the lion to roar
Where were you when I made electricity
Fall from the sky in the middle of a thunderstorm
Where were you

And I had no response, I had no reply
'Cause the One who spoke and is the truth opened up my eyes
And I laid my time of doubt at the feet of the infinite

Where were you when I taught the lion to roar
Where were you when I made electricity
Fall from the sky in the middle of a thunderstorm

Where were you when I put stars in the sky

We're gonna die eventually
It's no more or less our fault
Than it is our destiny

So now, Lord, I come to You
Asking only for Your grace
You know what I've put myself through
All those empty dreams I chased

And when my body lies in the ruins
Of the lies that nearly ruined me
Will You pick up the pieces that were pure and true
And breathe life into them, set them free?

And when You start this world over again from scratch
Will You make me anew out of the stuff that lasts?
Stuff that's purer than gold is
And clearer than glass could ever be
Can I be with You? Can I be with You?

Everybody, all and each
From the day that we are born
We have to learn to walk beneath
Those mercies by which we're drawn

And now we wrestle in the dark
With these angels that we can't see
We will move on although with scars
Oh Lord, move in me

And when my body lies in the ruins
Of the lies that nearly ruined me
Will You pick up the pieces that were pure and true
And breathe life into them and set them free?

When You blast this cosmos to kingdom come
When those jagged edged mountains we love are gone
When the sky is crossed with the tears
Of a thousand falling suns as they crash into the sea
Can I be with You? Can I be with You?

Can I be with You? Can I be with You?
Can I be with You? Can I be with You?

And when my body lies in the ruins
Of the lies that nearly ruined me
Will You pick up the pieces that were pure and true
And breathe life into them and set them free?

And it's not a movie but news of a hungry child across the world
There might be

There might be peace on earth
There might be peace on earth
There might be peace on earth
There might be, there might be
Might be peace

When I look at the world and see
We got a problem, we're seeing the surfaces too often
Whether race or religion, it makes no difference
The blood paid penance, forgiven the death sentence
No lines no more, no rich, no poor

No Jew, no Greek and no slave, no free
When I look at you and see someone just like me
There might be, there might be
There might be, there might be

When the Lord of all is the Lord of each
And I love you like He loves me

Life carried me along

Where human effort is all in vain

Wandering down some pointless road to nowhere

And ran a course I could not start
And when He saw in full
Just how much His would cost
He still went the final mile between me and heaven

Safe at last
We can breathe a sigh
Seems the storm has passed

Through it all
No one knew
That all the tears in heaven
Would bring me back to you

No one I know
Imagined we would make it
But it only made us glad we both believed

You and me, we're a miracle

Meant to be and nothing can change it
Mountains move and oceans part
When they are standing in our way
You and me, we're a miracle
Angels stand watching over us
And heaven shines upon us every day

Every time I felt near defeat
You were there for me
On my side completely
You give me strength
You set me free
This is because of you
I'm all that I can be

When I'm with you
The world is ours to reach for
Together there is nothing we can't do

You and me, we're a miracle

Meant to be and nothing can change it
Mountains move and oceans part
When they are standing in our way
You and me, we're a miracle
Angels stand watching over us
And heaven shines upon us everyday

The chance was so unlikely
That we would ever be
Two stars above the heavens
Destiny brought you to me

You and me, we're a miracle
Meant to be and nothing can change it
Mountains move and oceans part
When they are standing in our way
You and me, we're a miracle
Angels stand watching over us
And heaven shines upon us everyday

Itchy trigger finger

Todd Coolman,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laurie,2000

Todd Duncan,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars",Thousands of Miles,1949

Letting the sunlight into my eyes

And it's crystal clear
That I don't ever want it to end

Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine

Living the gold and the silver dream
Making me feel like I'm seventeen

I lost you to

And still the days

To nights that never end?

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat

Days of you and me
Underneath a sheltering sky
Did we move too fast for the glow of love to last

When autumn comes and summer goes
I will remember through November
What September knows:
That nothing lasts forever and
Summer love moves on

So when the leaves begin to change
I find it sad but never strange
That you are all I can recall

We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before

You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

Here's the tale of a young black male
Raised in these city streets
Out here hustling to make ends meet
In a world that's so corrupt
That's ran by greed
Money and the power
For me I'm a survivor
I do what I have to and only God can judge me for that
So before you cash your stones down on me
I want you to take a look at yourself in the mirror
And ask somebody to pray for you
Cause that's all I'm asking is to pray for me, understand

I was born around gangstas, hustlers, and killers
Drug dealers with math figures making hella scrilla
In the city of Chi the home of the G's
If ya don't work ya don't eat that's been the code of the streets
As for me I was brought up at an early age
Learned how to cook cane started to gang bang
And its a damn shame I chose game
But see I'ma knuckle headed nigga with no one to blame
And I'ma gonna keep on tipping under the street lights
And be wondering which nigga wanna take my life
Until then I'm staying two feet in front of you haters

[chorus]
I'm living the street life
And I just can't get away
I don't know if I'ma gonna make it to another day
So everynight I pray
Oh I pray
I'm living the street life
And I just can't get away
I don't know if I'ma gonna make it to another day
So everynight I pray

well I'm surrounded by rats, roaches, and dope fiends
My whole world is being weighed up on a triple beam
Man I don't know what's in store for me god
Will I reach 21
Why is life so damn hard
See that's the question that's asked
And is there a heaven or hell can the young black live
Or will he be chained in the cell
I don't know as for me I only trusted a few
I had to hustle to survive now what else could I do
They say there's chances for everybody that's bullshit
That little girl had no chance when that bullet hit
I mean it blew to the sky
And all you heard was a cry
Oh lord don't let my baby die

[chorus]

Til the day that I die I'll stay true to my neighborhood
Fuck with my neighborhood nigga I wish you would
Ain't shit changed like oh once said
And oh no fool my nigga Fred ain't dead
Neither is Pook or Kansas City
True og's still here with me
My homie boo, boo what up
And you know I can't forget about my nigga nigga Novesnake
Nightime boats and herbie
Shine and Cherelle would ya pray for me
I rock genue death so dam sensless
Big houses what the fucking radio been missing
And there's one more nigga that be true to my heart
Mr. Motion you the reason while I'm breaking em off
So our
I peed em to dead
Whole reason was love
To that nigga twist for believing in me
I got a shorty to feed
My priority is to make sure this shit don't have to struggle like me
And if I could ask for one more wish
I tell em I wanna hug ya 'cause I'm missing ya since

[chorus]

so I'm asking to pray for me
Mamma pray for me
Daddy pray for me
Baby pray for me
Please pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me

Why you all in my business
Why you really really want to know the 4-1-1
Is it cause that my game's tight
I can scoop a bitch and fuck her on the same night

It was a, Saturday evening bout seven at night
White T, white thongs pockets feeling alright
I got a, call from one of my caramel chicks
She said I mean be careful I think they talking on some hate shit
Despite the talk of the town, I'ma be there
For 45 minutes when you hear the horn come down
And when she climbed in, I received a kiss and a hug
In a minute take off your shoes on a white persian rug
Wave your number rolling going to get bent
Why they sure call thugs mugging I see him right through the tent
He had the nerve enough to tap on my glass
But he ain't had enough light to peek in but I almost blast his ass
Is it cause that I'm known to bust
So quick to bump a bad bitch that y'all known to trust
So when you see me on them thangs in the Cadillac truck
Man don't even know me when you see your bitch in the back or front

[Chorus x2]

Foul, god damn you hagging
Sixteen block my wall you want to block my magic
Now you wondering no what Nitty be doing
While these bitches trying to find out who am I screwing
And I'm so, sick and tired of the motherfucking gossip
And I'm, sick and tired of the motherfucking coppers
They actually post up at the end of my block
Take a hoe from her spot just for trying to plot

And I'm like, damn friendly why you all on me
Man I'm out here slanging records shit I stopped selling weed
Tell me, are you mad cause you see what I drive
Or are you checking out these broads with the big ass thighs
It be my main bitch, getting on my last nerves
closest now to the edge from getting kicked to the curb
She got a homegirl, all up in her hair
Maybe they just meant my hair's longer than her's

[Chorus x2]

And I'm, sick of them haters that be all in my shit
Everytime I turn around somebody always be talking bout Twist
Want to know who got a baby by me, what does he drive, where my tip
Be all in my bidness because they heard that I've been bumping they chick
I ain't no lie, if I scoop your bitch up
I will, If I get scratch from her
Fold it up, if I tell her bend over
She won't get up, if I give up the bunch
What you need to know fo', you the player po-po
Steady beeking and poking paranoia smoking on too much doe-doe
Creeping all in my bid' no since I first splurged on a Rego
I got birds when I see you, I'm starting to think you work for them people
Hurt 'em when I tell 'em, I think you better ease up, cause everybody
Know you no G when it come to the money put some g's up
Until you hip lock and freeze up, you might as well
Turn around and go like the other way when I see you

[Chorus x2]

See me riding real slick thick and rolling on thangs
Got the misses and the bitches want to know my name
They want to know what I'm on
Get the fuck up out of mine homie go on and get your own
Riding slick with the cherry wood grain
In my big boy truck with the candy paint
Why, bitches giving me brain
I know you want to ball like me but you can't
Stay the fuck up out my business man

I got that 9 double M glock, with the infrared beam dot
Aiming at your knot, making your heart stop
Yelling out ""Fuck Tha Po"" who some call it 5-0
Better look out for when they pull that kick door
Nothing but gangstas, that's all who I hang with
Slanging them thangs with, came up in the game with
The fucking hood rats, because them some broke hoes
Me get a rich bitch and stick her for her dough
The Manor in that K-Town, that's how we put it down
Letting off fifty rounds, that's how our shit sound
Artillery up the ass, scullies and ski masks
9's and bubble masks, gunning at your ass

Money and the power, moving that flour
Taking no shorts and taking no losses
Hauling niggas asses off in coffins with that..

And it went BLOW! BLOW! body bag that bitch

Left his ass with more holes than a golf course

Where them stories are true about them Manor boys
How we leaving 'em, bleedin' and crawling on the ground
Like he's a dead nigga now

I got that love for my nigga Twist, for aid and assistance
He told me holsters, caught him up in some bullshit
Don't even trips though, I'm heading in your route
Soon as I roll up, we puttin' they lights out
Poppin' a clip in, with one in the chamber

Finna' ride on a stranger, put the hoes life in danger

I'm a G from Chicago, pull the game weightless where I go

Bustin' pistols with laser injects, putting holes in they Avarex

Going straight through your tailored vests, now it's you or your neighbor next

Now we got your boy tied up, to the hideout we ride up

lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the iz-H phenomenal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I can buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone, Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matos, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
militant, y'all faggots ain't killin' shit
Oops Crystal keep spillin' shit, you overdid it homes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The most shady, Frankie baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin' to make dough, like Jurassic
Park did quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me

Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up 'til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
to make classics, hotter than acid

My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced 'em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be

We got the shit, Mac tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heaters in the two-seaters, with two Midas
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P. Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Matty broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off 'til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the 'Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Luc'
Black Rob joined the Mob, it ain't no replacin' him
Niggas step up, with just Mase and 'em
Placin' them in funerals, criminals turned aroused
The Brick City, nobody come off like P.Diddy
Business wise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men
You screamin, I position, competition

Pull the plug and inject

So what's it all about? 
Where we gonna run? 
Maybe we can meet up on the sun 
Discretion is advised 
For the blood of virgin eyes 
Limpin on the track with Method 
So get the sunblock 
You get your one shot 
Until you dissolve 
I revolve around everything you got 
From outta nowhere prepare 
You'll be blinded by the glare 
I told you not to stare 
Now you're turned into stone 
Without a microphone 
But don't you forget you're in the zone 
So shut the fuck up!
And take that shit back 
Cause all your shit's whack 
Doodoo is doodoo

Burnin up your brain like a piston 
So all those who didn't listen 
Never even knew what they were missin 
And never even knew that the sky was fallin down

Until they swallow
Whisper things into my brain
Your voice sounds so hollow

I am not a leader of men
Since I prefer to follow
Do you think I could have a drink
Since it's so hard to swallow
So hard to swallow

So turn the television off
And I will sing a song
And if you suddenly have the urge
You can sing along

I touch your hand, I touch your face
I think the fruit is rotten
Give me lessons on how to breathe
Cause I think I've forgotten
I think I've forgotten

One day, up to a cliff
That overlooks the water
I jumped in to save a girl
It was somebody's daughter
And now the ring is on my hand
It was given to me by her
To this day we all sit around
And dream of ways to get higher
To get much higher

When every step I take is always too small
Maybe it's just something I can't admit but lately,
I feel like I don't give a shit

Motivation such an aggravation,
Accusations don't know how to take them
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration never hard to break it
Situation never what you want it to be

What's the point of never making mistakes
Self-indulgence is such a hard habit to break
It's all just a waste of time in the end
I don't care so why should I even pretend

Accusations don't know how to take them

It keeps on dragging me down, it's getting kind of lame
I'm falling further behind, there's nothing to explain
No matter what you say nothing's gonna change my mind

Can't depend on doubt until the end
It seems like leaving friends has become this years trend
and though I can't pretend, afraid to be this way
It's not the same but who's to blame,
For all those stupid things I never said

Why don't you lend me an ear

Todd Rundgren,"I went to the mirror this morning
I looked in the mirror instead
The first thing to come into focus
Was a face wrapped all around my head

There's something sticking out of the middle
I guess it's my nose (I suppose)
I just don't recognize those eyes
All these years I've been watching from the other side

The voice is now one of brutal stupefication. The underlying question is - ""If
You went crazy, would you know it?""
Uh oh, here I go thinking them crazy thoughts again.
Who is that there? You mean I been walking around

In that all these years? What's it all about?
Where's it all at? I don't want to get heavy but
What am I doing here? uh
My lip has a dark spot upon it

Capacity has suddenly been reduced to that of a
Cherrystone clam)

And there on my chin I discover
One lonely red and arrogant zit
I went about my business this morning

You got to get out of bed and make that bread
But try as I may to get away
I won't forget what I seen in the mirror today
Boogie on out to a brand new day.

Get off your back and dance!
I seen my eyes. I seen my nose. My lips. My teeth.
My, my gums. I seen my gums! I looked all the way

Out on the sea in a great big boat

To stroke the oars that drive our galleons on
And while we rowed we had our song
And we had our god, and it may seem odd
But at least there was a cause

Caught a wind and we upped the sail
Lost two ships when it turned to a gale
Down went a third when she rammed on a whale
Though we despaired we could not fail

And through it all we never faltered
Late at night I lay on the decke
Wondering whye I risk my necke
Picture myselfe in a sinkinge wrecke

Ande downe I'me goinge notte knowinge whye

It's such a drag to carry on

Sit you down to a Nordic meal
Give you strength that you might wield
A Viking sword and a Viking shield

And off we'll sail in mighty ships of yore
Perhaps we shouldn't let our hands get sore
We need someone to pull the oars
And to do the chores

So we need a cause, so we need a reason why

I've seen lovers flying through the air
Hand in hand
I've seen babies dancing in the midnight sun
And I've seen dreams that came from the heavenly skies above
I've seen old men crying at their own grave sides
And I've seen pigs all sitting watching
Picture slides
But I never seen nothin' like you.

Do ya want my love
Do ya want my face
Do ya want my mind
Do ya want my love

Well I heard the crowd singin' out of tune
As they sat and sang auld lang syne by the light
Of the moon
I heard the preacher bangin' on the drums
And I heard the police playin' with their guns
But I never heard nothing like you
In the country where the sky touches down
On the field she lay her down to rest
In the morning sun
They come a runnin' just to get a look just to
Feel to touch her long black hair they don't
Give a damn

Do ya want my love
Do ya want my face
Do ya want my mind
Do ya want my love

Well I think you know what I'm trying to say
Woman
That is I'd like to save you for a rainy day
I've seen enough of the world to know
That i've got to get it all to get it all to grow

Do ya want my love
Do ya want my face
Do ya want my mind
Do ya want my love",Do Ya,1975
Todd Rundgren,"My great grandfather was a satisfied man
Contented in every way
Such was the course of his everyday life
'Til he heard of the seven rays (Repeat 3X)

Has a problem to face
He wants security for the home in his head
All he needs is the seven rays (Repeat 2X)

What goes through your mind?
Now don't nobody get uptight
Do you think that we can put up
With this shit one more night
All you need is just six more rays (Repeat 2X)

Take one beam of light
Prism acquire
Break the white light down
Seven rays appear (Repeat)

One, Red, the ruler seeking freedom
Two, Gold, the father seeking unity
Three, Orange, the thinker seeking understanding
Four, Yellow, the poet seeking harmony

Five, Green, the scientist seeking truth
Six, Blue, the disciple seeking goodness
Seven, Indigo, the artist seeking beauty

Todd Rundgren,"Something's Coming Lyrics
Could be!
Who knows?
There's something due any day;
I will know right away
Soon as it shows.
It may come cannon ballin' down through the sky,
Gleam in its eye,
Bright as a rose!
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach,
Down the block, on a beach,
Under a tree.
I got a feeling there's a miracle due,
Gonna come true,
Coming to me!
Could it be? Yes it could.
Something's coming, something good,
If I can wait!
Something's coming, I don't know what it is
But it is
Gonna be great!
With a click, with a shock,
Phone'll jingle, door'll knock,
Open the latch!
Something's coming, don't know when, but it's soon -
Catch the moon,
One-handed catch!
Around the corner,
Or whistling down the river,
Come on - deliver
To me!
Will it be? Yes it will.
Maybe just by holding still
It'll be there!
Come on something, come on in, don't be shy,
Meet a guy,
Pull up a chair!
The air is humming,
And something great is coming!
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach,
Down the block, on a beach,
Maybe tonight...",Something's Coming,1975
Todd Rundgren,"A handful of nothing is all that I need
It contains plus and minus everything
The odd combinations are what make up
The world that you see before you

In one hand I hold what people call good
The rest I hold in the other
But these are just symbols to the perfected minds
Of which we are but mere reflections

I was born to synthesize
Energize and catalyze
I was born to synthesize
Like waves on still water the forms reappear

Quickly erasing the ones before
But forms like these are born only to die
But the life in them lives forever
Pyramids, spheres, and obelisks

Are the patterns of all creation
But the red polygon's only desire
Is to get to the blue triangle
I was born to synthesize

Visions rise before your eyes
I was born to synthesize
The orbits of consciousness spin 'round and 'round
Apparently they go nowhere

But the odd combinations are leading you on
To your home which is in the center
You were born to synthesize
Ain't no jive - it's no surprise

You were born to synthesize",Born to Synthesize,1975
Todd Rundgren,"Just the other day I got a call from a friend
""I heard what you been playin' and I think it's a sin
Why can't you make a living like the rest of the boys
Instead of fillin' your head with all that synthesized noise?""
Jackals wait nearby, watching rock and roll die
And no one dared to help it
Vultures fill the sky

I thought we was supposed ta, supposed ta be free
But we all got sold
It must be the Death of Rock and Roll
The critics got together and they started a game
You get your records for nothing
and you call each other names
Things got out of hand and somebody got sore

Now we're all tuning up for the Rock and Roll War
Time to take up sides, helping rock and roll die
Pick up your check at the window
No one left to cry
I thought we was supposed ta, supposed ta be free

But we all got sold
It must be the Death of Rock and Roll
Nobody paid, nobody played, nobody stayed
Just my lonely guitar
Nobody paid, nobody stayed, nobody played
Just my lonely guitar",The Death of Rock 'N' Roll,1975
Todd Rundgren,"As the sun rises in the east
As the wind blows the fog across the sea
As the hand of Man creeps across the face of the world
Caught in a web of glamours
Persian perfume and oriental eyes
Yogi in knots and Sufi wise
Master sublime and swami high
Through in some Voodoo on the side
And a dash of the old Kung Fu
Lord you got me strung out on eastern intrigue
Chapter six and verse eleven
If you want to get to heaven
You've got to ask the Man who owns the Property
Ya gotta dance your dance
And do your act
And get His Big Attention that's a natural born fact
I'm on my knees, one question please
Will the real God please stand up?
Jesus and Moses, Mohammed, and Sri Krishna
Steiner, Gurdjief, Blavatsky, and Bhudda
Guru Maharaji, Reverend Sun Myung Moon
On the banks of the Holy Nile
As the palm tree sways at the base of the sphinx
'Neath a crescent desert moon many thousands
younger than ours
In fact, forget about time completely
Think of it in the abstract please
Think of the swaying tropic trees
One of your many destinies
Like having a hot peyote tea
In the palace of Fu Manchu
Lord you got me strung out on eastern intrigue
Sell your wife and pawn your heater
Buy the new Bhagavad Gita
Do the pranayama 'til your spine gets sore
I'll tell you for free
'Cause God told me
We checked it with the Pope and so we all agree
I'm on my knees, one question please
Will the real God please sit down?",Eastern Intrigue,1975
Todd Rundgren,"You know, wishing won't make it so
Hoping won't do it, praying won't do it
Religion won't do it, philosophy won't do it
The supreme court won't do it,
The president and the congress won't do it
The un won't do it, the h-bomb won't do it,
The sun and the moon won't do it
And god won't do it,
And i certainly won't do it
That leaves you, you'll have to do it

I know that you've been wondering
If i'm the same man inside
Never tried to fool you
'cause i've got nothing to hide
I gave you fair warning i could never be tied down
'til i've seen paradise with my very own eyes
Love owns us all, time owns us all, life owns us all
But the world doesn't own me
Dontcha follow me now
I ain't afraid to say i may have been wrong
I have to go now
I'd rather live by a dream than live by a lie
And that's why
There ain't no cure for what i've got baby
We just have to suffer
I feel no pain, i can't complain,
Things could always be rougher
But i picked up this banner
And i just can't put it down (no)
I can't let the world die just 'cause no one would try
Dontcha follow me now
Everybody's got to find his own place in the sun,
Everyone
So shine on me now
I'd rather live by a dream then live by a lie
You can say what you will about me
Talk is cheap and i don't mind
When you lay your life down in them grooves
You know you're bound to get scratched up sometime
It's only just a song, pay me no mind
I have to go now
You've got to walk that road alone
If you walk it at all
Don't follow me now
I gave you all fair warning
Now it's goodbye
And every once in a while why don't you think of me
'cause it's a long, long time and a long way to go
Can't you see the light shining in my eyes
'cause it's just one victory
'cause your dream goes on forever
Don't you know that i've been trying
To get my trip together
Be a real man
I got to be a real man
1, 2, 3, do it one more time
Be a real man
Everybody be a real man
Go then, don't believe, and i don't know

Todd Rundgren,"Power changes hands in the unseen worlds
'Cause in '75 something comes alive
Watch the silver cup and the golden rod
Silently listen and it shall be revealed
I was born to fly higher,
	born to stand where I'm standing now
Basking in the light of the neon fire
As it burns my useless body to the ground
Desire let me go
I would fly so high through the sky, never to die
Love has come, Love has come
Inside outside, it shall be revealed
Brilliant stars splash down across a crystal sky
And the moon and the sun and the earth are one
See the shining soul break the ring-pass-not
Spiraling upward and it shall be revealed
The spirit is free
The Universe wants it to be, It calls you and me
Love has come, Love has come
Over under, it shall be revealed
When the bells ring out
And the fire burns within and without
Initiation
When your star grows bright
	and fills all of the world with its light
Unification
Swallow your pride, you don't need it no more
Don't have to hide, all I am is only one more
Standing at the door
	waiting for the world's Initiation
Thunder roar and lightning crack
Snakes of fire dance up and down my back
A long, long road is behind me now
Too late to be afraid of the choice that I have made
But there's one thing I know
Where my spirit says to go,
	you know that's where I must go
When the golden ray
Of the dawn signifies a new day
Initiation
And when loves grows strong
And the spheres join together in song
Unification
Swallow your pride, you don't need it no more
Don't need to hide, all I am is
Only one more, then shut the door
	waiting for the world's Initiation
Over under, it shall be revealed",Initiation,1975

And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair

Good bop bop, good vibrations
Bop bop, excitations

Down at the magic dragon theater
More than you can imagine,
Down at the magic dragon theater

(come to the magic dragon)
Do you fancy melodrama?
Tragedy's mask, yours for the asking
Madness a la magic dragon

Who could that be at this time of night?
I'm sure we weren't followed dr. klang
Wait, pull down your knickers, he's going to hit us
Here goes your cue, don't blow your line
Dam, danger! I'm gonna go out there and get, get, get ...

All of a sudden there's a flash of light
Stars begin appearing in a moonlit night
Your vision of reality has gone awry
That's when you notice that your mind is flying
High in the sky out over the sea
But don't wonder why, where else could you be but",Magic Dragon Theatre,1977
Todd Rundgren,"Ritual dancer spins away
Lost in a whirling dervish ballet
Musicians playing
Out of tune in perfect harmony

Traveling down the sandy track
Compass in hand, guitar on my back
Trying to find the
Secret truth inside the pyramid

Foxy pharaoh knows all, won't tell
Dangerous knowledge locked in a cell
Method in madness
Ancient logic, never ending mystery

Anticipation fills the air
As the natives gather 'round
Watching the fiery sun go down
In the technicolor sky
Exploding mandala of light
Disappearing into darkness
A stunning sunburst finish
Shatters the horizon

Eye of the sphinx now winks at you
What is he thinking? wish that i knew
Wonder of wisdom
Far beyond this mortal comedy

Wind of the desert blowing strong
Mist of the ocean kissed by the sun
Tropical splendor
Paradise is calling you away

Make up your mind, don't make a scene
Wake up to find your garden is green
Please take your seat on board
The destination is utopia

Echoing across the canyon
Hear the song of the gypsy caravan
Magical voices in flight

Looking for the next oasis
'Neath the glow of the silver-shadow moon
Radiant princess of night

Stay forever, stay for a while
Hypnotized by sight and sound
Empty feelings bring a frown
Only love can make you smile",Sunburst Finish,1977
Todd Rundgren,"Hello, it's me
I've thought about us for a long, long time
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong
There's something here that doesn't last too long
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine
 
Seeing you, or seeing anything as much as I do you
I take for granted that you're always there
I take for granted that you just don't care
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through
 
It's important to me 
That you know you are free
'Cause I never want to make you change for me

Think of me
You know that I'd be with you if I could
I'll come around to see you once in a while
Or if I ever need a reason to smile
And spend the night if you think I should

Todd Rundgren,"Your Daddy runs sheep and my uncle runs cattle
Nothin' can keep us out of this battle they wage
As it burns up the range, 'til no man is left
In the saddle
Your ranch is upstream and they dammed up the water

Thirsty cows scream for my uncle to slaughter
The sheep while yore Daddy's asleep
And I do the same for his daughter
If I had my own way, we would be together

Back in Pittsburgh
It's the only town east of the river I know
And I feel kinda bad, bringin' our grief
Upon this pore old farmer's house

But we ain't got nowhere else to go
Three years on this range since they started the range war
Nothing has changed except maybe change for the worst
If I'd married you first,

There might not have been any range war
You wouldn't be lost to the range war",The Range War,1978
Todd Rundgren,"Pretty bird with feathers falling
Pretty as a lady calling
For her pink and midnight lover
As she stares into the water

And a yellow moon is rising
And there can't be no disguising
That the pretty bird is dying
With a silver arrow lying at its side

Rivers of blood,
Oceans of tears,
Life without death,
And death without reason

To the whole United Nations,
To your greatest expectations
To the moment that you realize
As a dark figure slips from out of the shadow

Pretty bird closes its eyes, pretty bird dies
Another pretty thing dead on the end of the shaft
Of the Zen Archer

A man in parts forgotten
With an outlook that is rotten
And an attitude to match it
Finds relief inside a hatchet
And he halved someone in Boulder
Justifiability is in the hands of the beholder
And you just don't know what people will do next

Mountains of pain,
Valleys of love,
Death without life,
And life without meaning

To the promise kept and broken
To the love that's never spoken
Just as surely as I'm in your ears
A dark figure slips from out of the shadow",Zen Archer,1978
Todd Rundgren,"See Ms. Malone
She spends another quiet evening alone
Sits in her study and stares at the phone
And a bell in her head will ring
All the children sing
All the dancers start to sway in time
The orchestra begins to play
Somebody pours the wine
The sun and moon collide
Isn't gravity a funny thing
The universe explodes apart
All the children sing
Of Mr. Malloy
He's always seen himself as one of the boys
He thinks that men are tough and women are toys
But a bell in his head will ring
All the children sing
All the birds are chirping harmony
The scent of love is in the air
Sunset on the sea
The angel of the Lord
Just declared we aren't worth a thing
The galaxy is null and void
All the children sing
Crawled across a thousand miles of desert sand
Looking from an answer from a holy man
And this is what he told me with a wave of his hand
He said, ""A bell in your head will ring""
Here's to the Chinaman, wise and old
Here's to the Eskimo, brave and cold
Here's to the Jew in the holy land
Here's to the Arab in his caravan
Here's to the African, strong and proud
Here's to the Redneck, good and loud
Here's one to you and there's one more thing
A bell in your head will ring",All the Children Sing,1978
Todd Rundgren,"Like a fly batters itself against a window
Time and again and again it senselessly blunders
Up and down the length of West Broadway
the bag lady wanders
Fifty cents rent goes pretty far
when you live in a subway car
One stop's the same as another
Even Son of Sam sees her sleeping,
she's not worth the bother
Sorrow, do they ever want to cry
Do they see us pass by
Where do they come from (simple answers)
Do they come falling,
falling from the sky like rain
Crawling up the basement drain
Misfits and black sheep
Former brothers, friends of mothers
There is no yesterday, there is no tomorrow
There is only now and that hardly matters
No one cares about sad old ladies
with bags full of tatters
One day it gets a bit too cold
Maybe a little too wet, maybe a little too lonely
Lifelessly she lies amidst her bag world
But maybe she's only sleeping",Bag Lady,1978
Todd Rundgren,"Sleeping at night in a plaster board box
Scratching the earth with the nails on my fingers
And the ground pukes up rocks and rocks and more rocks
And when the seeds finally reach the ground
It's all been for nothing
I hear the cries of children at night
I watch their faces grow sallow with hunger
Who draws the line between what's wrong and right
And when I ask my life is for
It's all been for nothing
Save your regrets for the dead, but for the living
Give them love and give them bread
One more hungry mouth to be fed
Remember the living
Give them love, give them bread
Standing in the light of the kitchen screen door
Like some kind of untouchable stuck in Calcutta
I almost forget what I'm standing here for
And I don't know what to do but I know
I won't leave with nothing
Where are the days when life was carefree
Why must I suffer this, what was my crime
Begging or thievery, which shall it be
Is there no other choice for me
I can't live with nothing
Justice only comes to the dead
And when they ask me what life is for
I must give them something",Bread,1978
Todd Rundgren,"Girl the last time I saw you, you were crying my name
When I put you on the spot,
Will you still feel the same

Show me some determination
Show me the measure of your dedication
I need to see just a reflection of your inspiration
Don't you break down on me

I'm looking for someone,
Someone strong enough to believe in
Everybody's looking for someone
Strong enough to stand on his feet
And never break down

I'll put my life on the line and believe what you say
I'll go out on a limb if you meet me halfway

I'm looking for someone
To show me what they mean by devotion
Everybody's looking for someone
Prepared to put aside his emotion
And never break down

You're a new wave raver and you like to talk tough
But can you still cut the mustard
When the going gets rough
I need a demonstration of your determination
Give me an indication of your determination

Three days in the rain and I ain't had no sleep
But I won't break down now, I got a promise to keep
Showing my determination
'cause that's the way I am",Determination,1978
Todd Rundgren,"The day is done, the blinds are drawn
The sound of afternoon is gone
The corner store has locked its door
And everyone has left for home
When their sleepy little heads
	settle snug inside their beds
You and I will stay and watch the sun fade away
The balladeer, the buccaneer
The liar, the man who would be king
The cavalier, the profiteer
The one who knows only suffering
As the cannons gather rust,
	all their castles turn to dust
You and I will stay and see them fade away
We are on an endless flight my friend
With no beginning and no end
I've forgotten more than I remember
Sometimes I want to hide myself away
But I know there's no escape
We must go on, go on forever
The sea will rise, mountains fall
The earth will turn itself upside down
But we have seen it all before,
	we will always be around
In a hundred million years
	when the planet disappears
You and I will stay
	and watch the world fade away
And in a million trillion years
	when the stars all disappear
You and I will stay
	and watch it all fade away",Fade Away,1978
Todd Rundgren,"Yesterday
I just saw the one you left behind, yesterday
I could tell that he was hurting for you
Sad, but he can't deny it
There was nothing else he could do
He was one of the many struck by it

Hurting for you
Finish before it started
It's the only thing left to do
'cause the last of the broken-hearted
Is hurting for you

Day to day
That's how you should learn
To live your life, day to day
Put aside those dreams that keep hurting for you
Don't let the pain remind you
There is nothing else you can do

We are all so pitifully small",Hurting for You,1978
Todd Rundgren,"Some people don't seem real at all
Unafraid of any mountain
Sure that the gods won't let him fall
Should he fall, he will always get up again

If he's hurt, he never shows it
If he's wrong, nobody knows it
Seems like he never has to try
He just must be a lucky guy

When it's lost, he always finds it
Nobody really knows just why

But I'm not afraid of the sound that calls me on
Like a siren singing in another world
Here comes a change, and another change,
And another change
And another wave of change
Like a heartbeat pumping from another world",Pulse,1981
Todd Rundgren,"Now as the evening sun sets on you healer
Your day is over, your light is fading away at last
And the wolves howl after the healer
Fighting for pieces, bits of his shattered remains
All who could know it
First they curse you then they warn you so
Then they use you and then they go on
'Til they curse you and there's no more
And they turn off all the light
that you were giving away
And they burn off but they just don't seem to shine
Is it all gone, is there no one who will shine?

Don't let the secret out, it's much too early
They are not ready but the hour is close at hand
For the wolves of the world are still hungry
But they are dying, there is no healing for them

You will know by the signs you have seen before
In your seeds of life there are more to come
The healer was not alone
He will turn on all the light
that they've been hiding away
Turn on the light
He will burn off
Come on and shine you diamond shine
They will turn on all the light
that they've been hiding away
They've got to turn on the light
They will burn off
Come on shine you diamond shine

There are a million eyes watching the world tonight
Have we learned nothing?
Do we merit another chance?
By what grace have we earned some redemption
Ten million saviors, ten billion angels of man
Those who know that such miracles can be so
They arrive because they must go
And lead believers to bring it home",Shine,1981
Todd Rundgren,"One of them plays a piccolo in my ear
Another one makes me smell things that aren't there
And they know where to hide
And they know everything that's inside

Of my head
Tiny demons, inside me
One of them ties a lasso around my heart
Another makes me nod when I drive the car

And they won't ever leave
But they won't show their faces to me
And they wait 'til I feel
Like they're gone and they jump out and steal

My relief
Tiny demons, inside me
Listen, listen
Listen for the sound

That is not in the music
Only you can hear it,
Only you can use it
It's the sound of someone breathing,

It's the breath of life
It's the sound that you are weaving
With the thread of life
Listen, listen

Listen to the sound,
Let nothing disturb you
You are in a place
Where nothing can hurt you

If you feel a strange sensation,
It can do no harm
Like the spiral of creation,
It will soon move on",Tiny Demons,1981
Todd Rundgren,"I can't carry on
This play is too long
I must be going
Extend my regrets

But now I'm going

She says she don't care
She wants to be fair
She must be joking
It's simple she said
 
Let's not lose our head
Tell me she's joking
This is too much for me to take
But somebody isn't faking
 
Someone's heart is breaking
And if you see her give her my critique
She's a bad little actress
Gets no curtain call
 
But the worst of all
When the curtain falls
There's no one at the backstage door
I'm more than her friend
 
'Cause I knew her when
She was no sensation
She's wasting our time
Repeats all her lines

What's her motivation?
Now she won't share her stage with me
Her performance was outrageous
Put me through some changes
 
So if you see her give her my critique
She's a bad little actress
Her delivery don't come naturally
Anyone could see she doesn't mean a word she says
 
Her mascara ran
And the show was panned
But I'm still her biggest fan
So when you see her give her my critique

It's just like the way I want a perfect fit
I can settle for less but all of them are wrong

It's my weakest quality, no vocabulary

She's been as kind as a girl can be

And I can tell that I'm not the one

It's just a matter of time
Forgotten but not gone
I'm the invisible guy
Forgotten but not gone

It was my mistake
'cause I gave less than I could take
And I never noticed
She wanted something I didn't have
And my roving eye
Drove her off to another guy
Now she doesn't see that
To keep from crying I've got to laugh

When all was said and done
I only wanted someone

Maybe it's one too many mornings after
Maybe I'm sick of my own nervous laughter

Now I'm looking for heaven
From the neck on up
For a perfect eleven
From the neck on up

I was a typical man
I had a master plan
I thought that heaven began
From the waist on down
And I had always said
That I could use my head
But I was thinking instead
From the waist on down
Maybe it's one too many frozen shoulders or
Maybe I haven't noticed getting older

Trapped in a dream

Of ships that pass in the night

I want to know what this game is about
I want someone to try and figure me out

I can't determine why
But I'm a different guy

Turned me inside out
It's not that I don't care
About your fine hardware

I can't figure out
Maybe I just can't finish what I've started or

About such problems as money and war

We mustn't waste another hour
We'll get directly to the soul

And everyone laughs when I sing
Hodja, please show me how to spin
I want to do that dance 'til I forget where I am
So get up out of your bed one more time
Hodja, make me spin
Yeah, teach me to spin like I seen you do
Why don't you make me the envy
Of the kids in school
I know what to wear, I know how to sound
I know about kissing the ground
From every alley in Konya
Mevlana sings ""Turn around, turn around
You've got to spin 'til your feet leave the
Ground""
Hodja, someday soon you will be moving on
So won't you let me be the one
You lay the secret on
And it's a 2 4 6 8, take it from the top
You've got to start me up and don't let me stop",Hodja,1985
Todd Rundgren,"I'm not afraid to bend my back
I'm not afraid of dirt
But how I fear the things I do
For lack of honest work

My family is lost to me
They could not bear the hurt
To see the state their boy is in
For lack of honest work

I hold no blame for anyone
'Twas I who did arrange
To pay my union dues so I'd
Not have to learn or change

And when I was replaced, 'twas I
Who started down the hill
And drank away my savings 'til
I couldn't stop myself

The prophets of a brave new world
Captains of industry
Have visions grand and great designs
But none have room for me

They see a world where everyone
Is rich and smart and young
But if I live to see such things
Too late for me they come

I know I'm not the only one
To fall beneath the wheel
Such company can not assuage
The loneliness I feel

So many are resigned to be
Society's debris
But I will be remembered for
The life life took from me

For I'm not afraid to bend my back
I'm not afraid of dirt
But how I fear the things I do
For lack of honest work",Honest Work,1985

He's looking for you with a rusty eye
In the Black Forest, lives an ogre named Lockjaw. Lockjaw doesn't like children
Who tell lies. Late at night he stalks the houses of the fibbers and the
Falsifiers, and before they can cry out from their beds, he nails their jaws
Open with a rusty nail, using his head for a hammer. You may escape him for a
While and think you fooled him, but he'll get you in the end. He'll get ya!
He'll get ya!!

A terrible tale?"" It seems such a cruel punishment for such a tiny little lie

Todd Rundgren,"Now I guess it's too late to speculate
On things as they might have been

Now you'll never know
How could you know the friend that you had in me

Lessons I never had
When you lose a friend forever

Ooh it hurt me so bad
I had always believed that you and me
Were connected by destiny
But the time never came
It sounds so lame
Is it all just my vanity?
Am I the only one to feel the sun
Exactly the way I do?

But I just can't find it
I believe that one day
I'll melt away into that lost horizon

Boy said ""I love you so""
Girl said ""I'll never leave you""

Seems like you'll never find
Someone willing to love you
Keep on looking you'll soon discover
A mighty love
Can sometimes make a weak man moan
Said a mighty love
You sit all day by the telephone
'Cause you're all alone
You need a mighty love
Some say that you're sure to find
True love and piece of mind
At the end of the rainbow
There's no sign in the sky to follow
'Cause that's the way love goes
And so there's a rhyme
That says life will soon be fine
Love is just what you make it
Keep on loving, you'll soon discover

Can sometimes make a weak man strong
A mighty love
Can sometimes make a rich man weep
And knock him off his feet
To have a mighty love",Mighty Love,1985

You just can't bring yourself to

Say out loud the reasons why

Until you get more than you ever bargained for.
Now its plain, clear as rain,
I've seen your symptoms many times before.
 	
Lying on your bed of pain
What will you have now?
What are riches untold in a life without compassion?
For there's no winter as cold
 	
As a life without compassion.
There's no prescription that's sold
That can heal you like compassion.
Well you tried and you cried,
 
And let your disappointment make you hard inside.
You have doubt, you reach out,
Still you're the only one you care about.
Hiding in your sack of woe
 	
What do you need now?
For there is nothing so sad
As a life without compassion.
And even love has turned bad,
 	
It was love without compassion.
And you don't need what you had
'Cause you did not have compassion.
Dying on your bed of pain
 	
What will you have now?
You'll get no judgment from me,
I can only feel compassion.
And if that's what you need,
 	
I will give you my compassion.
Just don't forget about me
'Cause we all need some compassion.
Open up your heart
 	
So you can start to feel compassion.
Get down on your knees,
Pray to heaven for compassion.
Everybody needs compassion.

Then you know you got to feel compassion",Compassion,1989

We've been waiting for the sun to rise and shine
Shining still to give us the will
Can you hear me, the sound of my voice?
I am here to tell you I have made my choice
I've been listening to what's been going down
There's just too much talk and gossip going 'round
You may think that I'm a fool, but I know the answer
Words become a tool, anyone can use them
Take the golden rule, as the best example
Eyes that have seen will know what I mean
 
The time has come to take the bull by the horns
 
We've been so downhearted, we've been so forlorn
We get weak and we want to give in
But we still need each other if we want to win

Get up boys and hit 'em one more time
 
We may be losing now but we can't stop trying
So hold that line, baby hold that line

Prayin' for it all day and fightin' for it all night

Something to fall back on
Something to fall back on

Like a crumpled dollar hidden in your hat
For the subway home when there's no welcome mat
You'd be left with nothing if it weren't for that
When you need to find it it's right behind you
Remember when you were the talk of the town

And you didn't care if I was around
But still you kept me in the back of your head
Just like the teddy bear that you took to bed
I was only something to fall back on
And to wake up lonely is your deepest dread

So you stay connected by a tiny thread
Though you'd rather try for something else instead

Sometimes I just feel so afraid
But I know that no one else has it made

So if I just believe in myself
I won't need no help from nobody else and I can make it alone
And everything will be cool, I got to keep on keepin' on
There's nothing else I can do

Sometimes I don't know what to do
Someone said the world's going to end and I think its true
I thought there was some love in the world
But I guess I'm wrong

Sometimes I just feel so alone
I don't want to admit to my friends that I feel confused
I wonder what I'd do with myself if the world was gone
Something makes me stay on my feet

Todd Rundgren,"Every day I hear the news
Seems like people worship pain
All your Oprahs and Donahues
They just can't explain

As you reap you shall sow
I looked high I looked low
Now I know that I love my life
I love my life

I said me and my creator
We got a funny love thing
It's happenin' now and not later
Yeah, that's why I sing

First came thought then came deed
I got caught now I'm freed
All I need is to love my life
I love my life

Time, the topic of the sermon tonight is time
Time, the thief of hope
Time, the ameliorator of all our endeavors
What will we do with time off our backs?

We would make this world a perfect place
We would make our lives a perfect thing, if not for time
But I tell you now, time is an illusion
Time is an illusion, time is not real

Time is the dividing line between what is true and what is not true
Between what is real and what is not real
Between what is so and what is not so
But who, I said who, who stands for time?

Who stands at the threshold of time?
Who decides what is true and what is not true?
We do, you and I
You and I decide what is true and what is not true

What shall be our guiding light?
Happiness, I say happiness
But in a world, I see people in a world of misery
I see a world full of sorrow

Why should we be happy?
Tell me why should we be happy?

Nothing you can do because a change must come

Your head in the ground
Money, money, money makes your world go 'round
You can't stop it
You can't stop, you can't stop, you can't stop, you can't stop
You can't stop love in action
You just joined the clan
Your head's full of sand
You need a bunch of friends to make you feel like a man

Todd Rundgren,"Everyone asks
Are we some kind of lovers?
Everyone asks what you're doing with me
I know this is not what they want
They're afraid you've been blinded
But I already know how it's going to be
If anyone should ask
Say we're mated
For as long as this life lasts
We are mated
Why else would you be here right now
And you know we'll still be here tomorrow
Nobody else understands what I'm doing
Nobody else makes me act in this way
And because they can't comprehend
What we mean to each other
They won't leave you alone
So you know what to say
I hold you in my heart
'Cause we're mated
In a very special part
We are mated
Why else would I be here right now

Todd Rundgren,"Kindred spirits moving along the spiral
I can see you up on another level
It's too great a fall
And I can't reach you to pull me higher
But I don't seem to get much closer or any more far
What would you tell me, if I could hear you speaking?
If you could touch me, how would I know the feeling?
I just can't imagine
But I try to do it anyway
I wish I was moving faster, I wish you'd drift back
But it just wasn't meant to happen
Very soon I'll have to
Face the fact
Some things never come together
Parallel lines running on forever
And you can't turn back
There is never any starting over
Parallel lines never do cross over
It's a challenge
Gotta make myself remember
Facing the truth, well, that doesn't mean surrender
What is bravado and how much is a force of will?
I know that the world is full of opposites that attract
But unless we ignore the physics
Very soon we'll have to
So I send you the gift of empathy
If you'd once in your life acknowledge me
I have visualized so thoroughly
That when I think of me I think of we
Can't face the truth
It means that we must surrender
Understanding won't satisfy the hunger
It whittles away at the destiny we fulfill
And like an animal running wild
You can't call it back

 Taking up sides when there ain't nothing to choose

 Stay up all night making sure that everything is right
 Get thee behind me Satan

 What happens when the twenty-five dollars is gone?

 Caravan spinning through the void

 How I remember the farm
 Oh how I miss the big city

 Cut off my leg for some shade

 It's a sand storm, taken by surprise
 Hide beneath your wrappings and cover up your eyes
 Well I lost my kit and camel
 Maybe I will die
 Feel so lost and helpless and I think I'm gonna cry

In a time unique, in a place divine
Keep your eye on the Ikon
Shining in the light of eternal mind.

I went to sleep a blind man
But when I awoke I saw
The legions of the lonely
See their faces, hear them call.

See how they hang on
Each one in a world of his own design
Listen to the Ikon
Ringing in the sound of eternal mind.

And the music plays forever
And it captures every ear
And the sound of barriers crashing down
Is the sweet harmony you hear.

Still, be still
To strong, so be still
Much too long, come down
Be still, look around
Listen here, be still
Hear the sound, be still.

Still we are here
We are still
Will we sing sweet
Sing we will
Still we are here
We are still
Nil is a fear all is nil
Still we are here we are still
Spill it let go let it spill.

The question comes to mind
About what should be done
And how much of the old will die
That the new may be begun
But you don't have to be afraid
Of being alone with nowhere to run.

You don't have to be afraid
To look yourself in the eye
You don't have to be afraid not to lie.

Someone knows who you are
Someone watches over you
Someone knows how you feel
And someone feels the same.

So you don't have to be afraid
Never fear, for you are living in eternal mind

For those who still recoil
For those who fear the pain
Of peering o'er the edge of
A new and different plane.

It's only human to despise yourself when you're weak

It's only human to be lazy and vain
It's only human to expect a world that's just as vain
I don't know why
I want to believe that it's not that way
But I'm johnny come lately, it's not my place to say

There's no escape, tell me why do they try so hard?
And I pretend that I'm invincible, that I can go it all alone
But I'm only human, trying to get by
And praying to heaven I might find out why am I human
Mere flesh and blood
Afraid to go on without someone to hold me up

It's just a human thing to fear the unknown
But isn't it a tragic thing to live and die alone
Oh lord look at the world,
Have you ever seen so much misery?
Like a ghost ship of fools, lost and floating out to sea

And they climb and they fall

So get your head straight before it's too late
And you drop it in the plate, you must appreciate

Jesus and money make a man speak in tongues
Scream out his lungs, roll in the dung
And when the song is sung, he moves up another rung
And the deaf and the dumb are the ones who get stung

Here comes the sex police, they're at your bedroom door
Movin' in next door, searchin' from floor to floor
You know what they're lookin' for
Someone's always keepin' score every time you dip the oar

Love isn't fun no more
Fascist christ, come to the rescue
Gimme that old time religion, here it comes
Let's get fundamental about this strange philosophy

In which god and man are enemies
In which there is no serenity unless you happen to believe
Precisely what they want you to believe, and no diversity
Come join the army and learn the noises

That drown out the others' voices and please the devil
Who rejoices when mankind has no choices
And power exploits us, and peace avoids us
Guess who to the rescue on a holy mission

To uphold the tradition of the Spanish Inquisition
And preempt your decision by forcing your confession
Now let that be a lesson
Who do you think you're messin' with?
Somebody took our god away",Fascist Christ,1994
Todd Rundgren,"Numb is the word when I get like this
Still out of touch, still couldn't feel a kiss, a kiss
Bells going off, but I can't say why
Trapped in the house with the walls and the roof on fire

Todd Rundgren,"I need something, I need some sweet thing
 I need something to help me get on, help me get on by
 Love thing
 Sometimes I feel like I've been trapped in a container
 Pushed through a strainer, but I ain't no complainer
 Think I'm going crazy, there, now I'm insaner
 What could be plainer, it's a no-brainer
 The truth is always wherever you find it
 Throw back the curtain, see what's behind it
 Look hard at life and the ties that bind it
 Day after day we must be reminded
 Everything I had is gone, it's so dark it must be dawn
 Where's that reason to go, reason to go on and on
 Give what you ain't got to give, Lord have mercy on me
 Drinkin' up blood and sweat and tears, I ain't afraid to ask
 Give it to me love thing, well being
 Why do I always look down when I want to look up
 Why do I shake somebody down when I'm feelin' shook up
 Why do I wander around when I want to hook up
 Why am I puttin' it down when I want to pick up
 One of these days I'm gonna make my decision
 And act upon it while I still got volition
 But I've got so many ideas in collision
 It makes it hard to be a man with a mission
 I need something, I need some sweet thing
 I need something to help me get on, help me get on by
 I need something to clear my head
 I need something to warm my bed
 I need something, some sweet thing

Todd Rundgren,"Let me tell you 'bout the new world order
 Not the kind to make you run for the border
 It's a new religion wrapped in a revolution
 With a proven solution for your mental pollution
 Don't let no one tell you that God ain't got a sense of humor
 Someone said he's pissed off, but that was just a rumor
 I know he's laughin' when the preacher starts to scream about
 How trippin' is evil, and sex is unclean
 Cars and gold bars and chains and diamond rings
 These are the symbols, we want the real things
 Peace in the soul and a natural insight
 Things that please the mind and make the body feel right
 Nature wants your life to go on long and on strong
 To have children and show them where you went wrong
 So if your life style leads you into hell or into prison
 Wake up and listen, this is what you're missing
 Free will, we can't seem to get our fill
 We are beggars, we are choosers drunk on a lack of power
 I believe in understanding, I've got to know where we're landing
 I'm takin' my survey now, hands up if you're with me
 Do you want different choices? Can't hear the quiet voices
 Got to dim all the lights, turn down the volume
 Put on a little more forgiveness, who's gonna be my witness?
 If we must endure this trial, someone is bound to touch us
 Do you want more sex, more comforting
 A little more foreplay and afterglow, let my people go
 Everybody wants peace on the earth, children sheltering
 Calling every man, every woman
 We're gonna take control of our own bodies
 Peace breaks out in the battle of the sexes
 We start to learn what the other one expects is
 We stay away from what the other one rejects is
 And have respect for individual perspectives
 We're gonna break out of this cycle of dependency
 And liberate each other from a hopeless life of drudgery
 And face up to the truth as we dispel all of this secrecy
 And simplify the situation when we learn to speak plainly
 We're gonna take control of the machinery
 Bad little actors that chew up the scenery
 Job number one is gonna be findin' a way
 That we can rave all night and meditate all day
 Mankind's strugglin' hard to see the light
 To hear the voice of the spirit in the night
 To lay down his heavy burden and pick up his soul power
 And build a heaven on earth hour by hour by hour
 Child protection, more careful mate selection
 Everyone wants to be wanted by a natural father and mother
 Lookin' for a sense of wonder, don't let your faith go under
 This is a beautiful world, if we could only give up fighting

And we go on carving, meanwhile half the world is starving
It's a crime .. hands off what is mine!
Take all you can 'til you slam on the parking brake
And you need space to make your own mistakes

But it's like ""I won't hold you back"" 'til the bags are packed

I want to bang on the drum all day
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day

Ever since I was a tiny boy
I don't want no candy
I don't need toy
I took a stick and an old coffee can
I bang on that thing 'til I got
Blisters on my hand
Because

When I get older they think I'm a fool
The teacher told me I should stay after school
She caught me pounding on the desk with my hands
But my licks were so hot
I made the teacher want to dance
And that's why

Listen to this
Every day when I get home from work
I feel so frustrated
the boss is a jerk
And I get my sticks and go out to the shed

And my mind knows what it wants
But my body just drags me down

But it's still very real to me
You can find it in the hole where I keep my soul
There it is - way down inside me
There's a real man
Forget about my body and be a real man

I see with my heart
I hear with my heart
I feel with my heart
Sometimes it works better

And some so-called friends put me down
And they pity me for trying
Bad emotions push me around
But the vision shines on and on

It will shine when we all are gone
And I'd like to add a little sparkle while I'm here
Light it up - way down inside me
There's a real man
Forget about bad feelings and be a real man

Afraid of everything and they laugh at nothing
And they only live to criticize

Todd Rundgren,"I had such great expectations
Of the world's benevolence
Of benevolence
But I prefer hallucinations
'cause they tend to make more sense
Than experience

'cause it was just another sneak attack
Of temporary sanity
It was a pleasant stay, but now I'm back
From temporary sanity
My temporary sanity

I began to grow dependent
On a thing called ""common sense""
It was common sense
But my world grew so resplendent
That the strain was too intense
Without self-defense

'cause it was just another sneak attack
Of temporary sanity
It was a pleasant stay, but now I'm back
From temporary sanity
My temporary sanity

The pool spreads across the pavement
Where the sniper made him lie
And he looks just like my youngest
And I'm watching him die
I must remind myself I've seen this
It's all ancient history
One long trail of twisted bodies
As the strong crush the weak
We must be crazy
We are crazy
This is our natural state
As our children die around us
We just sit here and wait
For a little temporary sanity
Some temporary sanity

There's a chance that we would still get the picture
If reality just came up and bit ya
But the news team would never report it
Because there's too much evidence to support it
If we were stupider, the problem would vanish
But our brains are much more than we can manage
We say we want something so bad we can taste it
But once we get it, then we turn 'round and waste it
We got a twisted fixation with marketplace
And every suffering soul is just another face
We think we're being manipulated from outer space
It's the collective guilty conscience of the human race
We get joyful when we look upon a lesser man
A specimen that we can be sure that we are better than
There is no shortage of supply of pride and vanity
There is no other explanation but insanity

You're listening to prozac
While the message goes unheard
It's the final word

We must be crazy
We must be crazy
There's no explanation
So we must be crazy

Todd Rundgren,"Cruising makes some people get uptight
But nothing beats a lonely Friday night
Friday night, nothing much to do but hang around
Think I might just grab myself a cab and head downtown
And for hours, I hang around the dance hall crowd
I feel like a boor
But then I turned around and cast my eyes to the door

In a long flowing robe
She appeared at the ballroom door
I was hard-pressed to know
What I hoped she was looking for

Coming on at first may not seem right
But nothing beats a lover at first sight
What a sight, nothing can compare with simple grace
It's all right, I see it in the look upon her face
That she wants me the same way that I'm wanting her
In fact maybe more
But as I take her hand
She turns and heads for the door

In a long flowing robe
She took off through the ballroom door
I was hard-pressed to know
What did she go and do that for

Friday night, nothing left to do but go to bed
Sleeping tight, when something stirring deep inside my head
Said ""Wake up and cast your eyes to the door.""

A hunger that I've never satisfied

I'm fumbling through life
From hunger
I writhe for someone
With a place I can hide my eyes

I'm searching for a mighty heart
Housed with a mighty crest
And from this base of operation
I would pacify the nation

But then who would rely
On a boob such as I
I'll be anyone's twit
For a mouthful of tittie

And still that hunger will thrive

Then they go make love
While you go insane. insane!

And if no one can feel the same
I'm a computer with a name

That special creature that is me
And if they fail to see the me I see
Then no one else knows truly what it is

Then you can let down your guard
But they cower in fear. in fear.
It makes you ill! ill!

Let's just say
We hereby conspire

That a change of attire
Is all part of the plan
Something that was so long suppressed
Starts to show when you wear a dress

They can unmake the man

There were times when we'd take it to the limit
And we'd never, never, ever leave each other alone
We were flesh and blood and bone
There were times we had it all
There were times we had it all

There were times when we took our chances
There were times we were damn good dancers
There were times when we heard all the answers
In the beating of the drummer and the riches of the rock and the roll
I can see right through your soul
There were times we had it all
There were times we had it all

If your fears could only be forgotten
We could pull all of the barriers down
Would you follow your dreams' desire
Would you follow your secret dreams and forbidden fire
Let's just peel out of this town

It's been nothing but dreams 
It's been nothing but dreams until now

You're never gonna see it

You got your head stuck in the sand

It's the land of the free and easy Street

It's the home of the damned

You're never gonna see it

You better open up your eyes

You're the only one who's left-

Who's gonna believe all your lies

I can't explain it away 
It doesn't make any sense

To know what it's like
I guess you gotta go through it
It doesn't matter baby

Loving you's a dirty job 
But somebody's gotta do it

There were times when our bodies glistened 
There were times that we can't stop missing 
There were times that we'd lay in bed and listen

To the pounding, pounding chorus of our desperate hearts
Nothing could have torn us apart
There were times we had it all
There were times we had it all

There were times when we fought like tigers
There were times we were damn good liars

There were times we extinguished every fire

That was burning, burning, burning up each other alive
From the heavens on down to the dives
There were times we lost it all we lost it all
There were times we lost it all we lost it all

There were times when we fought like tigers
There were times we were damn good liars

There were times when our bodies glistened
There were times that we can't stop missing
There were times that we'd lay in bed and listen
To the pounding, pounding chorus of our desperate hearts
Nothing could have torn us apart

Because some snot nosed pube has blocked me out
And I wait, and I wait

And I hate my frickin I.S.P., he ain't got no bandwidth left for me
And I'll never get back, never get back the time that I waste
That's what I hate

My job's so hard to swallow but it's got me by the collar
In some Motel 6 squalor, where every local call's a dollar

I got no time left to jack off, I got a deadline that won't back off
I'm about to chew my own leg off 'cause
It's so late, and I'm late

And I hate my frickin I.S.P., I get bumped for inactivity
And I'll never get back, never get back the time that I waste
That's what I hate

It rained CD Rom's that gave me twenty hours free
I let my service provider make a junky outta me
And then he cut me off from my online community
And now I hate, I hate it, I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate

I hate my frickin I.S.P., his domain name lookup takes eternity
And I'll never get back, never get back the time that I waste

Todd Rundgren,"I've got a great big problem that I can't fix.
I think it's quarter to three when it's half past six.
Everything's early or way too late.
Now I never can remember the day and the date.

Never used to be this much trouble before.
I used to watch the clock but not anymore.
I used to keep track of the time I'd lose,
But now the whole thing has me so confused.

I have to find a new job every week or so,
'Cause no one needs a man who's always fast or slow.
Still you'll get no complaint from me,
But what can the answer be?

Where does the time go when I'm with you?
How many hours do I lose every day?
They recombine when I'm missing you,
Slowing me down like a digital delay.

Where does the time go when I'm with you?
Why does it seem like there's never enough?
It's just like I'm living split in two.
Two kinds of time when you're out and in love.

There's only so much pleasure a man can take,
'Til his brain starts to go and his senses fade.

Doesn't need to eat or drink or sleep.
Can't feel a thing 'cause he's in too deep.
Walks around thinking that the world is fine,
While an alien force takes over his mind.

And then he throws away every single dime,
And the last thing to go is his sense of time.
But then if you're having fun,
Who cares if you're that far gone?

They tell me that time's not free.
What did time ever do for me?
And if I don't see that's wrong,
Then maybe I'm too far gone.

Todd Rundgren,"You got speed, turn it on
What I need to mow my lawn
You're my steed I ride til dawn

But you don't realize just what they say 
You may fight, you may run, you may know what you've done 
It makes me feel so sad to think what I might've had 
I watch the stars, I watch the sun, now I watch for anyone 
But it's only make believe

You work, you work, you work so hard and then 
Someone, someone will come around again 
You may think it's for real, but you know how you feel 
The places that I go don't feel good anymore 
I see it all rainbows in fall I see her face upon my wall 
But it's only make believe

Fly away, bluebird fly away for me 
To a place somewhere far across the sea 
Fly away, far away, don't look back, go today

 Back to the fields and forests
 Now I am one of them
 ""Turn on the power"" cried the army of sound
And the hum of the amps shook the trees and the ground
 And like a single man we cranked up the knobs
 And a thousand guitars sang our national anthem
 We captured the whole human race
 There was nowhere to hide, playing filled every space
 Jamming the world back into place
 Everyone a star

Whoever gets your heart is the winner
There is only one winner
I'm at war with a man that I still haven't seen
It's a fight for life, if I lose you I'll die
Somebody's got to lose you and that's why

There is only one winner
There is no second place
I only know I must be the winner
There is nothing to lose but the sight of your face
I can't stay around if I know you're not mine
Somebody's gonna be lost in your mind

There's a line I don't want to have to follow behind
And I just can't see myself hugging you, loving you
There is only one winner
You're the one to decide
You've got to tell me who is the winner
Tell me who gets the broken heart, who gets the bride
Not a thing I can do - it depends upon you
But nobody wants to win more than I do

I can't lie, and I'll do anything to show you my side
I won't lie, no lie
I'll do anything to bring you over to my side

If you want all my time is yours
Time is yours to make me the winner",Only One Winner [Todd's Vocals],2002

Can't remember when I had such fun
Maybe later it won't matter
No spent feelings looking at her
When she's out of sight, if she's out of mind

Something tells me though she's left me, it's not over
Still I thought we'd had a very nice time",Resolution [Todd's Vocals],2002

I was the first in line, cause we were, like
Dragging our knuckles along the ground
(dragging our knuckles along the ground)
Ever since, I've been convinced that every
Sacred thought is mine, and you were still
Dragging your knuckles along the ground
(dragging your knuckles along the ground)

Cause I think I'm there, dude (don't get ahead of yourself)
I think I'm there, dude
(Already high)

And when they asked us who will lead
I thought it surely must be me
But I stood up too fast
(I stood up too fast)
Because as soon as I was boss
The next one in line took my head clean off
Cause I stood up too fast
(I stood up too fast)

I was barely in my teens when I decided I was tired
Of always like dragging my knuckles along the ground
(dragging my knuckles along the ground)
So with all due haste I based until I got so freakin wired
Forgot I was dragging my knuckles along the ground
(dragging my knuckles along the ground)

I thought I was there, dude (you'll got ahead of yourself)
I thought I was there, dude
Already high

And when they asked for volunteers
I must have thought they said 'drink beers'
And I stood up too fast
(I stood up too fast)

I can imagine things that can't possibly exist
And then I add them to an ever-expanding list
And when I've solved every significant test there is
Then I'll move on no matter how many clues I've missed

It's so easy to be smart but it's a struggle to be wise
You shouldn't be always throwing your weight around
(always throwing your weight around)
It's much better to be humble than to have a big hat size
Or you'll be just begging somebody to take you down
(begging somebody to take you down)

And you'll be nowhere, man (you got ahead of yourself)
And you'll be nowhere, man
Already high

And right before your very eyes
I have ignored my own advice
Cause I stood up too fast
(I stood up too fast)
And nobody has the slightest choice
But to put up with my droning voice
When I stood up too fast
(I stood up too fast)

I don't want no candy
I don't need toy

She caught me pounding on the desk with my hands

I made the teacher want to dance

I thought as a child
I spoke as a child
I didn't know better

But now I'm a man
I look like a man
I'm old as a man
And I should know better

Got my head in the sky
And my mind knows what it wants
But my body just drags me down
And my world is something you can't see

But it's still very real to me
You can find it in the hole where I keep my soul
There it is - way down inside me
There's a real man
Forget about my body and be a real man

I see with my heart
I hear with my heart
I feel with my heart
Sometimes it works better

And some so-called friends put me down
And they pity me for trying
Bad emotions push me around
But the vision shines on and on

It will shine when we all are gone
And I'd like to add a little sparkle while I'm here
Light it up - way down inside me
There's a real man
Forget about bad feelings and be a real man

Some men's world is only hate and money
Afraid of everything and they laugh at nothing
And they only live to criticize
You can laugh at me now [ha ha ha]

But the time comes to everybody
When you must decide
When that day finally comes along
You might wish you'd been a little more strong

Then you'll wake up in the morning cryin'
""Oh my God""

Be a real man
Suffer them slings and arrows

Now she'd been watching him from her table
Not too soft but not too tough
Well she figured by the money he'd been throwing around
That he was damn sure good-looking enough
So she worked her way over
She shot him a wink
He took his last five bucks
He bought her a drink
By the time they hit the Motel 6
They figured they was in love (love love love)
She loved that easy money

Tell it like it is, all right
It must have been about two weeks later
He got a call from a business friend
Who'd found a sure-fire steal of an investment deal
And honey guess what? He's gonna let both of us in
So they took all their savings out of the bank
And on the way home they stopped to gas up the tank

She stepped in for some cigs
And she never saw the fucker again
He got that easy money
It's sad but it's true
Everybody wants the most they can possible get
For the least they can possibly do
He thinks it's easy money
I don't understand.

Like I'm having
Holding onto to anything that I can
To keep myself
From anything but laughing

Out my window, winter is almost over.
I can almost see the sun behind the clouds
Looking back on where I was one year ago today, laughing at the shape I'm in now.

But all I heard was how I should get ahead.
Now growing up, it ain't anything but all this indecision
With these debts and doubts and worries
Hanging over my head.
When I was a child,
I spoke as a child.
I wish I could remember what I said.

I'd like to find that old-time feeling
Somewhere in between what I've become
Somewhere down the line, it must have seemed appealing,
So I suppose that it must work for some.

But I wanna go back to going crazy,
Believing every word that I was told.
You know, sometimes, growing up, I think I'm getting wiser,
And then other times, I think I'm getting old.

He told me it was the perfect country and western song.
I told him it was not the perfect country and western song cause it
Didn't mention momma, it didn't mention trucks, hell it didn't have a
Country beat. 
It's more of a kind of a jazz thing. And it's about bass.

We used to throw the baseball
And we'd climb his old oak tree
You know we would sneak his old man's cigarettes
Behind the picket fence
We swore that we would always be best of friends

We used to sit out on the curb
And talk on summer nights
Until Jackie's dad would call him
And he took off like a light
The Friday nights were all the same
Our high school senior year
We hung out at the river
Drank black label beer

And we would listen to the Stones
With all of our old friends
Maybe sneak a toke or two
Down where the river bends
Well I remember how I said

I'd drive him home on Friday night
Well he said go on without out me

And I was shocked to see the cops

Than anything I've got today

You were climbing up all those trees

Todd Snider,"Old Miss Virgy tended bar at this shack out in the hills
It never made her any money boys but paid of all her bills
Now she must have been 80 years old but her heart was warm

And her beer was cold
She gave away more than she ever sold
Smiling all the time
I used to sing off in the corner every Friday night
To a loud crowd of cowboys, bikers and bar room fights
They were drinking beer, carrying on, not a one of them listening to one of my songs

But old Miss Virgy sang along
She said she knew 'em all by heart
And then one night after closing she poured me another beer
She said ""Come on over and sit down you little shit
I got something you need to hear""

She said ""Life ain't easy getting through everybody's gonna make things tough on you
But I can tell you right now if you dig what you do, they will never get you down""
She said life's too short to worry
Life's too long to wait
Too short not to love everybody
Life's too long to hate

I meet a lot of men who haggle and finagle all the time
Trying to save a nickel or make a dime
Not me, no sireee, I ain't got the time
Now I ain't seen Ol' Virgy in must have been about ten years
I've been bumming around this country singing my songs for tips and beers

Now the nights are long
The driving's tough
Hotels stink, and the pay sucks
But I can't dig what I do enough, so it never gets be down
I say life's too short to worry
Life's too long to wait

And years from now I would bet
We'd be together still
But just in case
Just in case

I didn't think you would mind
Here honey sign this dotted line
What's yours is yours
And what is mine will always be mine

Just in case
Well you know I can't love you enough
But I also can't afford to lose half of my stuff
There's no doubt in my mind
These ties that we're about to bind
Will hold us both together any time it gets too tough

A little out of tune
Sorta lost in space
Racing the moon
Climbing the walls
Of this hurricane
Still overall
I can't complain

All I wanted was one chance
To let freedom ring
They said I had to get a permit
Tags and everything
I never made it through the red tape
I got this paper hat
I got a job working weekdays
You want fries with that

I got nothin' to lose
Cause there's nothin' to gain
It's like a one way ticket to cruise in this passing lane
I can't complain

I was talkin' to my girlfriend
I told her I was stressed
I said I'm going off the deep end
She said give it a rest
We're all waiting in the dugout
Thinking we should pitch
How you gonna throw a shutout
If all you do is bitch

So now I got a brand new dance
I need one more shot
I just need one last chance
I know I won't get caught
I gotta make my last stand
This time I can't be bought
Then again on the other hand
How much have you got

I got nothin' to lose
Nothin' to gain

Hey, hey, my, my
Rock and roll will never die
Hang your hair down in your eye
You'll make a million dollars

Well I was in this band goin' nowhere fast
We sent out demos but everybody passed
So one day we finally took the plunge
Moved out to Seattle to play some grunge
Washington state that is
Space needle
Eddie vedder
Mudhoney

Now to fit in fast we wear flannel shirts
We turn our amps up until it hurts
We've got bad attitudes and what's more
When we play we stare straight down at the floor
Wowee
Pretty scary
How pensive
How totally alternative

Now to fit in on the Seattle scene
You've gotta do somethin' they ain't never seen
So thinkin' up a gimmick one day
We decided to be the only band that wouldn't play a note
Under any circumstances
Silence
Music's original alternative
Root's grunge

Well we spread the word through the underground
That we were the hottest new thing in town
The record guy came out to see us one day
And just like always we didn't play
It knocked him out
He said he loved our work
He said he loved our work but he wasn't sure if he could sell a record
With nothing on it
I said tell 'em we're from Seattle
He advanced us two and a half million dollars

[Chorus]

Well they made us do a video but that wasn't tough
'cause we just filmed ourselves smashin' stuff
It was kinda weird 'cause there was no music
But MTV said they'd love to use it

The kids went wild, the kids went nuts
Rolling stone gave us a five-star review said we played with guts
We're scorin' chicks, takin' drugs
Then we got asked to play MTV unplugged
You should have seen it
We went right out there and refused to do acoustical versions of the
Electrical songs we had refused to record in the first place
Then we smashed our shit

Well we blew 'em away at the Grammy's show
By refusing to play and refusing to go
And then just when we thought fame would last forever
Along come this band that wasn't even together
Now that's alternative
Now that's alternative to alternative
I feel stupid
And contagious

Well our band got dropped and that ain't funny
'cause we're all hooked on drugs but we're outta money
So the other day I called up the band
I said boys I've taken all I can
Shave off your goatees
Pack the van
We're goin' back to Athens",Talking Seattle Grunge Rock Blues,2003

We got the projects two or three blocks from here
They pull the kids over for driving while African
And the ones with the warrants always run in fear

So, I sit here, waiting for the coast to clear
Wishing once again I had a gun around here
Turn on the news and what do I hear
Some kid shot the bank up on Gallatin road

Ran away from the cops while he was trying to reload
He beat them up to Eastland street on feet
Now, he's probably reloaded and running down my street
Better turn the alarm on and lock myself in

Helicopters over the house again

Sometimes, you rise above it
Sometimes, you sneak below
Somewhere in between believing in Heaven
And facing the Devil you know

Poor kid probably never had a chance to give a fuck
Wouldn't know good luck from a debutant
He's gotta find a way to be Steve McNair or young buck
Or it's tough luck looking for a prison to haunt

And you can fuck getting any kind of job you want
Unless you really want to work in a fast food restaurant
And who wants to do that? Do you want to do that?
I wouldn't trade that for my crooked hat

Or my gang or my gun or my waist full of pagers
For a job deep frying shit, for richer teen agers
If that's where it's at and no one's gonna help
How you gonna blame a man for helping himself?
There's a war going on that the poor can't win

Sometimes, you rise above it
Sometimes, you sneak below
Somewhere in between believing in Heaven

Can't see how this kid is gonna get very far
Unless he finds a way to make it back over to Barry street
And he can't do that unless he steals a car

Man, the way things are, they just don't seem right
All the white people talking 'bout the hope and the light
There ain't no hope in Sam Levy just guns and drugs
We ain't building bridges, we're just training thugs

Then I hear a terrifying kick at my back door
And in comes this kid, I say, ?Hey I've seen this kid before?
I see him all the time at that bar on woodland street
Now, he's bleeding in my kitchen, tracking mud off his feet

And he's looking at me like I'll either help him or die
Until he sees in my eyes that I'm on his side
I hand him my keys, I say, you better move fast
There's a J in the ashtray and plenty of gas

He throws me the cash and says I'll be back for this
I say, yeah, well, don't be surprised if there's a little bit of it missing
His gold teeth glistened with a big old grin
He said we'll talk about that when I see you again

He shook my hand, I shook his back
I felt like I was about to have a heart attack
Until he finally drove away, I thought ?Goddamn""

On the Corpus Christi Bay
I'd get off and drink 'til daylight
Sleep the mornin' away
I had a plan to take my wages
Leave the rigs behind for good
But that life it is contagious
And it gets down in your blood

I lived in Corpus with my brother
We were always on the run
We were bad for one another
But we were good at having fun
We got stoned along the seawall
We got drunk and rolled a car
We knew the girls at every dancehall
Had a tab at every bar

If I could live my life all over
It wouldn't matter anyway
I never could stay sober
On the Corpus Christi Bay

My brother had a wife and family
You know he gave 'em both a home
But his wife thought we were crazy
And one day we found her gone
We threw here clothes into the car trunk
Her photographs her rosary
We went to the pier and got drunk
And threw it all into the sea

If I could live my life all over
It wouldn't matter anyway
I never could stay sober

In every day in every notice
The hour it is going slow
So how am I to show this
And I've got this feeling
Something's going on

Wake up in a kinda sweat
Fingers slightly numb and shaking
Blood flows back into your hand
Must be the way you have been sleeping
And I've got this feeling
Something's going on

The hats that were stacked on the shelf
The glasses the clock the wall
The picture of Michael and Bubbles
Something's going on

They could give a tick or tock
And maybe that would be the problem
It could be a simple thought
It's something that is meant to solve it

If you've had enough, don't put up with his stuff, don't you do it

If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, you can do it

Tell him to just get out,

Nothing left to talk about

Pack his raincoat show him out

Just look him in the eye and simply shout:
Enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

Don't pretend that is right when it's over

(it's over)
If the feeling is gone don't think twice just move on, get it over

I'm walking down your street
Again and past your door
But you don't live there any more

It's years since you've been there
But now you've disappeared
Somewhere like outer space
You've found some better place

And I miss you like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you like the deserts miss the rain
Could you be dead?
You always were two steps ahead of everyone

We'd walk behind while you would run
I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you shout down to me
Where I always used to be

And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
Back on the train, I ask why did I come again?

Can I confess I've been hanging around your old address?
The years have proved to offer nothing since you moved
You're long gone but I can't move on

And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you

I step off the train
I'm walking down your street
Again and past your door
But you don't live there any more

It's years since you've been there
But now you've disappeared
Somewhere like outer space
You've found some better place

And I miss you like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
And I miss you like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you like the deserts miss the rain

Like the deserts miss the rain
The deserts miss the rain

Todd Terry,"Artilleryman: We're gonna build a whole new world for ourselves. Look, they clap eyes on us and we're dead, right? So, we gotta make a new life where they'll never find us. You know where? Underground. You should see it down there, hundreds of miles of drains, sweet and clean now after the rain, dark, quiet, safe. We can build houses and everything, start again from scratch. And what's so bad about living underground, eh? S'not been so great living up here, if you want my opinion.

Brave New World

      Artilleryman
      Take a look around you at the world we've come to know
      Does it seem to be much more than a crazy circus show
      Maybe from the madness, something beautiful will grow
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start... we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!

      Artilleryman: We'll build shops and hospitals and barracks, right under their noses, right under their feet. Everything we need: banks, prisons and schools. We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and then like you we'll teach the kids. Not poems and rubbish; science, so we can get everything working! We'll build villages and towns, and... and we'll play each other at cricket! Listen, maybe one day we'll capture a fighting machine, eh, learn how to make 'em ourselves, and then: WALLOP! Our turn to do some wiping out! WHOOSH! With our heat ray! Whoosh! And them running and dying, beaten at their own game, man on top again!

      Artilleryman
      Now our domination of the earth is fading fast,
      And out of the confusion a chance has come at last,
      To build a better future from the ashes of the past,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      Look, man is born in freedom, but he soon becomes a slave,
      In cages of convention from the cradle to the grave,
      The weak fall by the wayside but the strong will be saved,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...
      But if mankind is to survive, the people life alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      And it's going to have to start with me and you... YES!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...
      But if mankind is to survive, the people left alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      Yes and we will have to be the chosen few...

      Just think of all the poverty, the hatred and the lies,
      And imagine the destruction of all that you despise,
      Slowly from the ashes the phoenix will arise,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men
      We'll start all over again!

      Take a look around you at the world you've loved so well,
      And bid the aging empire of man a last farewell
      It may not sound like heaven but at least it isn't hell
      It's a brave new world with just a handful of men,
      We'll start, we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!
      I'VE GOT A PLAN!

      Artilleryman: Can't you just see it? Civilization starting all over again! A second chance! Heh- we'll even build a railway and tunnel to the coast, go there for our holidays! Nothing can stop men like us! I've made a start already. Come on down here and have a look.

In the cellar there was a tunnel scarcely ten yards long. It had taken him a week to dig. I could have dug that much in a day, and I suddenly had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his power.

      Artilleryman: It's doing the working and the thinking that wears a fellow out. I'm ready for a bit of a rest. How about a drink, eh? Nothing but champagne now I'm the boss.

We drank, and then he insisted upon playing cards. With our species on the edge of extermination, with no prospect but a horrible death, we actually played games. Later he talked more of his plan, but I saw flames flashing in the deep blue night, red weed glowing, tripod figures moving distantly, and I put down my champagne glass. I felt a traitor to my kind, and I knew I must leave this strange dreamer.

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say

Wherever I go  
I doodle-doo doo die doo doo
 
I've heard all the melodies
From the blues to rhapsodies
They all come and go 
But there's one I know 
That'll linger and tease
I've found all the blues a pest
Rhapsodies to me a jest
So if you want to please me
Just take this one request

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

A cantar

Digo ritmo
Es algo que debes sentir

No podés cantar

Entre lo mejore me e paseao, no me an opacao

Mientras otros buscan fama,billete y corona

Como esos que quieren dar censura al genero de rap 
Por culpa de cantantes que an tirao basura 
Quieren sacarno de la radio prensa y televisore
Pero y lo mejore vamo a paga junto por pecadore? 

Se que el loquillo al aplaude al gatillo, de guerra y mucho corillo 
Prueba que no estoy de acuerdo con la tiraera
Ni la copiaera, primero apoyo a los mios y luego a los de afuera
Y soy del ghetto, vengo para obtener respeto
No hago como otro que quieren actuar como moyeto

Te guta como el balla sunba? quiero que sepa que soy queso 
Y moreno porque nací de la rumba
Así que en vez de ta guillandote de genio
Trata de invertarte algo para este milenio
No pierda tanto tiempo tanto tiempo tratando de hundirme
Aprovecha y copia ahora que estoy en peligro de extinguirme

Toma, ahora en peligro de extinciona
Pues cantante como nosotros no hay en la zona 
Va de 'corazona' pa la 'persona'

[Verse 1: Warren G]
When I step up in the place your chance is gone
That bitch you was glancin on
If she leaves with me, no chance that her pants is on
No bra no panties on
Make me suck the same thang that my hand be on
Redbone big bitch with a sandy tone
We gone, South Beach in the Miami zone
Damn she wrong, bad little candy cone
One head nod from me she out the door
One head job from her she out the door
Back to the beach, back yo, the line o
All bullshit aside she's a cold piece
The type to might go search the whole beach
The type to might go out and bring back somethin wild
Screamin, fuck me fuck me fuck me!!!

[Chorus: Toi]
Sexy walkin with that attitude, you lookin at me, I'm lookin at you
Although I know I wan't you I just can't help but check for you
Lookin at me, I'm lookin at you
Sneaky ways but I ain't mad at you, lookin at me, lookin at you
Just imagine how this could go, I wan't you so
And if you give me a chance, boy you know it's gonna get real
Uh huh, yeah huh

[Verse 2: Warren G]
I take mine from all waist line, face to the dime, waste no time
Grind on the dicktake mine with a lick
You still be singin that Sunshine shit
It's your world girl come collide with the dick
Some hot tone champagne Heather Hunter dominant some moan shit
Home alone on some groan shit
King Kong make you moan with this
And still wan't it all, in the club bathroom stall
Backseat take your clothes off
And still fuck your broad, and all it take is one phone call
Show up, and I'm beatin up all walls
No joke, she broke all laws,handcuff a nigga lost balls

[Bridge: Toi]
There we roll (Creep)
I got a spot where we could go and roll (Creep)
Whether you can kick it holla let me know (She creep)
I'll keep it on the low, ooh oh oh (Creep creep creep creep)

[Verse 3: Warren G]
Sexy walkin with a street attitude
Love to get between the streets and cheat on your dude
Besides, these drugs, got me in the mood
After the club we can choose how Stella got her groove
I ain't tryin to live rude, meet at my room number 2-1-3
Private slumber party, with your name on the V-I-P
That's how we get crunked sip realy and get drunk

Although I know I wan't you I just can't help but check for you

Toi et Moi,"Words are flowing out like 
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which 
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a 
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears 
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Toi et Moi,"The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

And still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here
Lead me to your door

Toine,"I mean what is there to fear
I'm from black America this is just another year
You're new to disrespect by your elected puppeteer
Well let me show you how to persevere
Just get up every time somebody knocks you down
And celebrate in front of people like they're not around
And if they try to build a wall to keep you balling out of bounds
Use the bench they told to you warm to keep the fences knocking down
Shout out to latinos 'cause hustling ain't illegal
We praying to the Isa the father, we all are equal
But if parted they will progress in stopping us getting C notes
Well let me ask the crowd, do one of y'all disagree?
This for Chopper City though I represent the county
Until your vote is counted know I got you until I'm outy
It's all about the effort and I'm effortlessly fresher
If I'm preaching to choir know they're bound to get the lecture
It went from folks around me, pushing envelopes and boundaries
So you won't only hear me where you found me
I'm somewhere asking questions like ""Can I be afforded the most?""
You better answer me with more than a no
Tryin' tell ya

Ooh, never not getting enough
From this life that I'm leading and all I believe in y'all know, I ain't leaving I'm posted, like
Ooh, never not getting enough
From this life that I'm leading and all I believe in y'all know, I ain't leaving I'm posted, like
This if for the county and the areas surrounding
DC, Maryland and Virginia know I'm with you

Now whatchu willing to let die first
Your pride or your freedom
The story of my life's inner conflict
It's like I follow my dreams
But how am I supposed to slide in the DM
On this mic, is what I'm trying accomplish
I used to do it for the fist bumps and applauses
But caring about respect started making me nauseous
You walk into a room, and bammas speak to you cautious
Like employees trying to figure out who the boss is
So now I just kick it for, the most divine
Working overtime
Sitting with an open bottle, looking for an open mind
Trying not to be aggressively jaded
Because I find myself just getting faded
And I know that ain’t quite me
I step up for whatever it might be
And RSVP when inspiration invite me
Because who else gonna look out for those who look like me 
Another disenfranchised boy in a white tee

Ooh, never not getting enough
From this life that I'm leading and all I believe in y'all know, I ain't leaving I'm posted, like

DC, Maryland and Virginia know I'm with you

All I know is love
I give it how I get it, I can never get enough
Sympathy to enemies 'cause hate ain't in blood
And if you can relate you've given up
I'm trying to make the most of it though
Getting close is a no
Want nothing less than yes 'cause it's suppose to be so
The cost of nothing too low
My expectation too high
I'd rather die
Than be complacent with the way that it goes
Apathy is a disease and we're just steady sharing needles
Unaffected people carry evil
Ease is what we know
We've got to raise the bar though
The sorrows of today will give away to a tomorrow
So what's a week of paid leave
And empty promises of hiring
Just to fire me before retirement
I'm trying to make more in one day than 401K
So give me what you promised to pay
Because it's never enough

And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill",Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!,
