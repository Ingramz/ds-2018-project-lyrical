Ethan Goodpaster,"Sugar city come home
Wizard on a weekend
Willing on a weekday
Are you kidding come on
Fed up with the prepay
Looking for a keepsake
I'm no emerald liar
Dying for a card up my sleeve
I'm the gambling kind
For higher stakes and brighter takes I'll play

I'll make a deal with you, if all you want
Is not to leave love, to run 'em up

Call me When It Lands
Hit me up when you're close
Call when you can
Call me when you're close

Sugar city
Pretty magic
Got me good vibes
Thank God I ain't driving
Traffic vision
Blurred blue bleedin'
That's a black out ladder
It don't matter anyhow
I'm climbing
Keep my good vibes
And check coats for cool climates
In common we got
Good friends rolled light on split ends
Pretty magic
Traffic addicts

Now I don't really know where you stay at, can I get an address?
Never mind my phone dead forget it
I don't really know where to bake that, less you tryna get in
In which case my phone dead, forget it
And I never answer calls when I'm in the kitchen
Cooking
It's just a thing
It's out
And I never call back when my friends all looking at me in the car
'Cause it'd be all they wanna talk about
Oh you tryna to get a deal? A deal? A deal
Sorry on the real
But my eyes and my ears don't work well
And the floor keeps sliding out my heels
I can't feel 'em am I still dreaming?
Skull on the table a still life
Is this still life?
What's the meaning are we still dealing?
Feel like I can't act right
Oh right

Sugar city
Pretty magic
Got me good vibes
Thank God I ain't driving
Traffic vision
Blurred blue bleedin'

Keep my good vibes
And check coats for cool climates

I'll make a deal with you, if all you want
Is not to leave love, to run em up

Call me When It Lands
Hit me up when you're close
Call me when you can
Call me when you close

When were you planning on coming my way?
I've been here waiting all damn day to turn the the lights down low
And turn the table on you
Will you keep all that you came with and more?
I'd play your game but I don't know what for
Cut the cable on
Every table I lose

Call me When It Lands
Hit me up when you're close
When you know you've won",When It Lands,2018
Ethan Hawke,"I got a pothead mama, got a cokehead dad. 
I'm an ultramodern version of the American man. 
I don't feel good, but don't feel bad. 
'Cause me you see, I'm nuthin'

Ain't no republicrat, no demmican, they ain't nuthin in between. 
I'm sick of people talking about American dreams -that's all gone. 
Ain't nothin' there for me cause me you see I'm nuthin'
I ain't left, I ain't right. 

People say I'm wrong before I was born. 
It was all gone. 
Don't even make sense that I wrote this song. 
'Cause me you see I'm nuthin, I'm nuthin'

Don't want no big TV or no flashy garage, never would cut it in no corponate job. 
People see me coming - they say look at that slob cause me you see 

I'm nuthin', I'm nuthin'",I'm Nuthin',1994
Ethan Iverson,"Though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around
My man an' I, we gin some
We pray some, and sin some

He don't love me like I love him
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good
Yes I've got it bad
And that ain't good",I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good),1993
Ethan Iverson,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul,1999
Ethan Iverson,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When,1999
Ethan Iverson,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon",How High the Moon,2000
Ethan Iverson,"It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as he
Should cause you such misery and pain

I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.",In Love in Vain,2000
Ethan Iverson,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so
The look of love

Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]",The Look of Love,2000
Ethan Iverson,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,2000
Ethan Iverson,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady Be Good",2000
Ethan Iverson,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All,2002
Ethan Iverson,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,2002
Ethan Iverson,"My old flame, I can't even think of his name but it's funny now and then
How my thoughts go flashing back again to my old flame
My old flame, my new lovers all seem so tame
For I haven't met a gent so magnificent or elegant as my old flame

I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes, some who took me up to the skies
But their attempts at love were only imitations of my old flame
I can't even think of his name but I'll never be the same 
Until I discover what became of my old flame

Ethan Iverson,"Oh she may be weary
Them young girls they do get wearied
Wearing that same old miniskirt dress
But when she gets weary
You try a little tenderness

Oh man that
Un hunh
I know shes waiting
Just anticipating
The thing that you'll never never possess
No no no
But while she there waiting

Try just a little bit of tenderness
That's all you got to do
Now it might be a little bit sentimental no
But she has her greavs and care
But the soft words they are spoke so gentle
Yeah yeah yeah
And it makes it easier to bear
Oh she wont regret it

No no
Them young girls they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Yeah yeah yeah
But its all so easy
All you got to do is try
Try a little tenderness

Ethan Iverson Trio,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you
",I'm Getting Sentimental over You,1998
Ethan Iverson Trio,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,1998
Ethan Johns,"I meant to ask you how to fix that car
I always meant to ask you about the war
And what you saw across a bridge too far
Did it leave a scar

Or how you navigated wings of fire and steel        
Up where heaven had no more secrets to conceal
And still you found the ground beneath your wheels
How did it feel

Bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly
To dust be returning from dust we begin
Bang the drum slowly I'll speak of things holy
Above and below me world without end

I meant to ask you how when everything seemed lost
And your fate was in a game of dice they tossed
There was still that line that you would never cross
At any cost

I meant to ask you how you lived what you believed
With nothing but your heart up your sleeve
And if you ever really were deceived
By the likes of me

Bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly
To dust be returning from dust we begin
Bang the drum slowly I'll speak of things holy
Above and below me world without end

Gone now is the day and gone the sun
There is peace tonight all over Arlington
But the songs of my life will still be sung
By the light of the moon you hung

I meant to ask you how to plow that field
I meant to bring you water from the well
And be the one beside you when you fell
Could you tell

Bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly
To dust be returning from dust we begin
Bang the drum slowly I'll speak of things holy
Above and below me world without end",Bang the Drum Slowly,2000
Ethan Johns,"You don't love me this I know
Don't need a bible to tell me so
I hung around a little too long
I was good but now I'm gone

Like the buffalo
That boy from Tupelo
Any way the wind can blow
That's where I'm gonna go
I'll be gone like a five and dime
It'll be the perfect crime
Just ask the boy from Tupelo
He's the king and he oughta know

The shoulder I've been leanin' on
Is the coldest place I've ever known
There's nothin' left for me round here
Looks like it's time to disappear

Like the buffalo
That boy from Tupelo
The old wall down in Jericho
Maybelle on the radio
I'll be gone like the five and dime
It'll be the perfect crime
Just ask the boy from Tupelo
He's the king and he oughta know

You don't love me, this I know
Don't need a bible to tell me so
It's a shame and it's a sin
Everything I coulda been to you

Your last chance Texaco
Your sweetheart of the rodeo
A Juliet to your romeo
The border you cross into Mexico
I'll never understand why or how
Oh but baby its too late now
Just ask the boy from Tupelo
He's the king and he oughta know",Boy From Tupelo,2000
Ethan Johns,"I have seen your soul turn black
And then retreat
To that dark place where no one else may follow
I waited here for your returning
To roll your cigarette
And wash your bloodied feet

You have heard the silent running
Of my dreams
Broke me from the grip of grief and fever
With the sound of your voice speaking my name
And a kiss
That I will feel forever

In the hour of gold, the hour of lead
WG did forge our wedding bed
On a hard and holy road
We lay down our head
In tha hour of gold, the hour oi lead 

I have watched you riding on 
The wall of death
And when il finally breaks you and you fall 
I will tear this dress of muslin that you gave me 
To bind the fatal wound 
And catch your last sweet breath

In the hour of gold, the hour of lead
We did forge our wedding bed
On a hard and holy road
We lay down our head
In the hour of gold, the hour of lead 

But the world will be my witness when 
They excavate my heart 
And find the image of your face 
Imprinted there like some Shroud of Turin 
That neither time Nor tundra could erase

In the hour of gold, the hour of lead
We did forge our wedding bed
On a hard and holy road
We lay down our head
In the hour of gold, the hour of lead",Hour of Gold,2000
Ethan Johns,"God knows how I love you
Like a user needs a drug
And I'll never be free of ya
You are poison in my blood
I tried to swim that river
And get to higher ground
I been three times under
The next one'll see me drown

But I don't want to talk about it now
I don't want to talk about it now
I don't want to talk about it now
I want to go down

God knows why you don't want me
No one would do the things I do
But to my grave it's gonna haunt me
How I got down on my knees for you
You are my obsession
And the reason that I live
You alreday got my soul
There's nothin left to give

But I don't want to talk about it now
I don't want to talk about it now
I don't want to talk about it now
I want to go down

The devil is deep water baby
And I'm in way over my head
But I'd be drawn and quartered
If I could keep you in my bed
I can't break this spell
I know the trouble that I'm in
But If I got out of the mouth of hell
I'd walk right back again

Ce que j'ai pu
I have seen some trouble
Been around the say
Rode the streetcar of desire and I paid
And if you want a witness
I will testify
To what I saw through a wandering eye
 'Cause nobody loves you like I do
 Nobody loves you like I do
 Nobody loves you like I do
 Nobody loves you like I do
I heard all about it
You don't need an alibi
There was no medicine I did not try
You lost your Mona Lisa
Got burned by Jezebel
You can always draw water from my well
 'Cause nobody loves you like I do
 Nobody loves you like I do
 Nobody loves you like I do
 Nobody loves you like I do

You know it's true
J'ai fait tout, j'ai fait tout, j'ai fait tout
You can go and leave me 
But you'll come back for more
I know where all your old secrets are stored

Ethan Johns,"Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were older
You were looking like Picasso
With a scar across your shoulder
You were kneeling by the river
You were digging up the bodies
Buried long ago
Michelangelo

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed you were a pilgrim
On a highway out alone to find
The mother of your children
Who were still unborn and waiting
In the wings of some desire
Abandoned long ago
Michelangelo

Were you there at Armageddon
Was Paris really burning
Could I have been the one to pull you
From the point of no returning
And did I hear you calling out my name
Or was it forgotten long ago
Michelangelo

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were riding
On a blood red painted pony
Up where the heavens were dividing
And the angels turned to ashes
You came tumbling with them to earth
So Far below
Michelangelo

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were dying
In a field of thorn and roses
With a hawk about you crying
For the warrior slain in battle
From an arrow driven deep inside you
Long ago   
Michelangelo

Did you suffer at the end
Would there be no one to remember
Did you banish all the old ghosts
With the terms of surrender
And could you hear me calling out your name
Well I guess that I will never know
Michelangelo

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were weeping
And your tears poured down like diamonds
For a love beyond all keeping
And you caught them one by one
In a million silk bandannas that I gave you long ago
Michelangelo",Michelangelo,2000
Ethan Johns,"He said ""Oh my love. Oh my Antonia 
You with the dark eyes and palest of skin 
Tonight I am going from Santa Maria 
Wait for me till I'm in your arms once again""

She held me, she kissed me, begged me not to leave her 
To cross on 1he mountain my fortune to win 
But a letter now tells me she died of a fever 
I'll never see her in this world again

You are my sorrow, you are my splendor 
You are my shelter through storm and through strife 
You are the one I will always remember 
All off the days of my life 

I curse the ambition that took me far from her 
For a treasure not ever so fine or so fair 
As the flash of her smile or the touch of her fingers 
The fire in her heart and the smell of her hair 

She left me a note that cried ""Do not weep for me 
Behold you are with me as sure as the stars 
That rise in the evening to shine down upon me 
Behold I am with you wherever you are"" 

I can still hear him. he calls to me only 
What once was begotten shall come to no end 
But the road is so long and the nights are so lonely 
My soul just to hold him in this world again 

You are my sorrow, you are my splendor 
You are my shelter through storm and through strife 
You are the one I will always remember
All of the days of my life

I'd never see you in this world again",My Antonia,2000
Ethan Johns,"My baby needs a shepherd
SheÂ´s lost out on the hill
Too late I tried to call her
When the night was cold and still
And I tell myself IÂ´ll find her
But I know I never will
My baby needs a shepherd
SheÂ´s lost out on the hill

My baby needs an angel
She never learned to fly
SheÂ´ll not reach sanctuary
Just by looking to the sky
I guess I could have carried her
But I didn't even try
My baby needs an angel
She never learned to fly

Oh I ran so far through a broken land
I was following that drummer
Beating in a different band 
And somewhere on the highway
IÂ´let go of her hand
Now sheÂ´s gone forever
Like her footprints in the sand

Toora loora loora lo
First the seed and then the rose
Toora loora loora li
My kingdom for a lullaby

My baby needs a pilot
She has no magic wand
To help her part the troubled waters
Of the Rubicon
But in my soul I know sheÂ´ll
Have to go this one alone
After all that is only way sheÂ´s ever known

But there is no lamp in all this dark
That could chase away her shadow
From the corners of my heart
I pray sheÂ´s ride a dolphin
But sheÂ´s swimming with the shark
Out where none can save her
Not even Noah and his ark

Toora loora loora lo
To the cradle comes the crow
Toora loora loora li
My kingdom for a lullaby

My baby needs a mother
To love her till the end
Up every rugged mountain
And down every road that bends
Sometimes I hear her cryin'

To love her till the end",My Baby Needs a Shepherd,2000
Ethan Johns,"Let's take a ride to the seaside 
We can go out swimming in the high tide
Just wear your shorts and your long hair 
Don't forget the lawn chair 
Everybody's gone to the movies 
Everybody's gone and its groovy
They went to the one about the big war 
I didn't, I'd seen it before

I guess I'm taking my chances 
Giving up the ring throwing in my gloves
I guess I'm taking my chances 
Trading in my things 
For a couple wings a little white dove 
And one big love, one big love, one big love, one big love

Everybody do like a monkey

Ethan Johns,"O the dragons are gonna fly tonight
They're circling low and inside tonight
It's another round in the losing fight
Out along the great divide tonight

We are aging soldiers in an ancient war
Seeking out some half remembered shore
We drink our fill and still we thirst for more
Asking if there's no heaven what is this hunger for?

Our path is worn our feet are poorly shod
We lift up our prayer against the odds
And fear the silence is the voice of God 

And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah

Sorrow is constant and the joys are brief
The seasons come and bring no sweet relief
Time is a brutal but a careless thief
Who takes our lot but leaves behind the grief

It is the heart that kills us in the end
Just one more old broken bone that cannot mend
As it was now and ever shall be amen

And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah

So there'll be no guiding light for you and me
We are not sailors lost out on the sea
We were always headed toward eternity
Hoping for a glimpse of Gaililee

Like falling stars from the universe we are hurled
Down through the long loneliness of the world
Until we behold the pain become the pearl

We cry Allelujah

And we cry Allelujah Allelujah

Ethan Johns,"Me and my best friend Lillian
And her blue tick hound dog Gideon,
Sittin on the front porch cooling in the shade
Singin every song the radio played
Waitin for the Alabama sun to go down
Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town
Me and Lillian
Just across the line and a little southeast of Meridian.

She loved her brother I remember back when
He was fixin up a '49 Indian
He told her 'Little sister, gonna ride the wind
Up around the moon and back again""
He never got farther than Vietnam,
I was standin there with her when the telegram come
For Lillian.
Now he's lyin somewhere about a million miles from Meridian.

She said there's not much hope for a red dirt girl
Somewhere out there is a great big world
That's where I'm bound
And the stars might fall on Alabama
But one of these days I'm gonna swing
My hammer down
Away from this red dirt town
I'm gonna make a joyful sound

She grew up tall and she grew up thin
Buried that old dog Gideon
By a crepe myrtle bush in the back of the yard,
Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hard
Got in trouble with a boy from town
Figured that she might as well settle down
So she dug right in
Across a red dirt line just a little south east from Meridian

She tried hard to love him but it never did take
It was just another way for the heart to break
So she dug right in.
But one thing they don't tell you about the blues
When you got em
You keep on falling cause there ain't no bottom
There ain't know end.
At least not for Lillian

Nobody knows when she started her skid,
She was only twenty seven and she had five kids.
Coulda' been the whiskey,
Coulda been the pills,
Coulda been the dream she was trying to kill.
But there won't be a mention in the news of the world
About the life and the death of a red dirt girl
Names Lillian
Who never got any farther across the line than Meridian.

Now the stars still fall on Alabama
Tonight she finally laid
That hammer down
Without a sound
In the red dirt ground",Red Dirt Girl,2000
Ethan Johns,"He imagines the world
As the angel is sending
Like the ghost of a man
Who is tied up to the chair

And he tries to believe
That his life has a meaning
With his hand on his heart
Pour le monde, pas pour la guerre

And I wake up blind
Like my dreams were too bright
And I lost my regard
For the good things that I had
And the radio was sad

When you listen for good
In a hope that comes to nothing
'Cause the liars moved in
And they believe their own dark medicine

You act so nonchalant
But he is not a dog
Perform for you in the stadium
For the world, not for the war

And he won't hesitate
Though it might lead to heartache
In the night, Club Indigo
For the world, not for the war
Pour le monde, pas pour la guerre

Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,1995
Ethel Ennis,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Holding you again would only do me good
Oh how I wish I could but you're so far away

Before you start your preaching
Let me ask you this my friend

Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside
Going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden
Have you forgotten

They took all the footage off my TV
Said it's too disturbing for you and me
It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it everyday
Some say this country's just out looking for a fight
After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right

Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside
Going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden
Have you forgotten

I've been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember
Just what they're fighting for

Have you forgotten all the people killed
Some went down like heros in that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten about our Pentagon
All the loved ones that we lost
And those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry about Bin Laden

Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me

Is a job they give to me
Making nice guys out of stinkers

Funny 'cause I'd love to go travelin'
Small world, isn't it?

We have so much in common
It's a phenomenon
We could pool our resources
By joining forces from now on

Lucky, you're a man who likes children
That's an important sign
Lucky, I'm a woman who with children
Small world, isn't it?
Funny, isn't it? Small and funny and fine

You'd have steak when the job was done.
But, if I shot the herder, they'd holler bloody murder
And you can't shoot a male in the tail like a quail,

Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
I'm cool, brave, and daring to see a lion glaring
When I'm out with my Remington.
But a look from a mister will raise a fever blister

Nothing but blue skies
Do I see

Bluebirds
Singing a song
Nothing but bluebirds
All day long

Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly

Blue days
All of them gone
Nothing but blue skies
From now on

I should fret if the worst looks like the best
I should mind if they say it can't be true
I should smile, that's exactly what I do",Blue Skies [From Alexander's Ragtime Band],1997

Well if you remember
Wonderful!

Well Dearie, you're much older than I

Honey, I just got a long memory that's all.
Dearie, do you remember when we

Stayed up all night to get
Pittsburgh on a crystal set

Keystone movies, Coogan and Chaplin
Made you laugh and then cry

Test your memory, my Dearie
Do you recall when Orville Wright flew at Kittyhawk
But take it from me I would rather walk

Dearie, do you remember how they

Loved Harry Lauder's act
My wasn't the Palace packed

Ethel Merman,"Times have changed

Since the Puritans got a shock 
When they landed on Plymouth Rock. 
If today 
Any shock they should try to stem 
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock, 
Plymouth Rock would land on them. 

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking 
Was looked on as something shocking. 
But now, God knows, 
Anything goes. 
Good authors too who once knew better words 
Now only use four-letter words 
Writing prose. 
Anything goes. 
If driving fast cars you like, 
If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like, 
Why, nobody will oppose. 
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose 
Anything goes. 
When Rockefeller still can hoard en- 
Ough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows, 
Anything goes. 
The world has gone mad today 
And good's bad today, 
And black's white today, 
And day's night today, 
And that gent today 
You gave a cent today 
Once had several chateaux. 
When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
Lack baby clo'es, 
Anything goes. 

If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction 
Instruct Anna Sten in diction, 
Then Anna shows 
Anything goes. 
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up 
Now turns a handspring landing up- 
On her toes, 
Anything goes. 
Just think of those shocks you've got 
And those knocks you've got 
And those blues you've got 
From that news you've got 
And those pains you've got

From those little radios.

Your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all

That would bore me terrific'ly too

The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth.

Dreaming of you I composed a tune,
So will you listen to it, dear?

Doesn't one and one make two?

Does July need a sky of blue?
Would I miss you, would I?
If you ever should go away?
If the sun should desert the day,
What would life be?
Will I leave you, never?
Could the ocean leave the shore?
Will I worship you for ever?

Ethel Merman,"I was born on a thousand acres of Oklahoma land
Nothing grew on the thousand acres for it was gravel and sand
One day, father started digging in a field, hoping to find some soil
He dug and he dug and, what do you think?
Oil, oil, oil
The money rolled in and I rolled out
With a fortune piled so high
Washington was my destination
And now, who am I?

I'm the chosen party giver
For the White House clientele
And they know that I deliver
What it takes to make 'em gel
And in Washington I'm known by one and all
As the hostess with the mostest on the ball

They would go to Elsa Maxwell
When they had an axe to grind
They could always grind their axe well
At the parties she designed
Now the hatchet grinders all prefer to call
On the hostess with the mostest on the ball

I've a great big bar and good caviar
Yes, the best that can be found
And a large amount in my bank account
When election time comes round
If you're feeling presidential
You can make it, yes indeed
There are just three things essential
Let me tell you, all you need
Is an ounce of wisdom and a pound of gall
And the hostess with the mostest on the ball

Entertaining vodka drinkers
Is a job they give to me
Making nice guys out of stinkers
Seems to be my cup of tea
What they really need behind the iron wall
Is the hostess with the mostest on the ball

There's a book of regulations 
As to who sits next to who
But there might be complications
When the blue blood's not so blue
So the priestess with the leastest protocol
Is the hostess with the mostest on the ball

An ambassador has just reached the shore
He's a man of many loves
An important gent from the Orient
To be handled with kid gloves
He can come and let his hair down, ooh!
Have the best time of his life
Even bring his new affair down
Introduce her as his wife
But she mustn't leave her panties in the hall
Of the priestess with the leastest
Nor the hostess with the mostest
With the mostest on the ball",The Hostess with the Mostess' on the Ball,2006

I'll be right there, I've got my fair
When I see that rusty haired conductor man
I'll grab him by the collar and I'll holler ""Alabam'! Alabam'!""

That's where you stop your train, that brings me back again 
Down home where I'll remain, where my honey lamb am 
I will be right there with bells, when that old conductor yells
""All aboard! All aboard! All aboard for Alabam!""",There's No Business Like Showbusiness,2006

That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,

At least it'll tell you how great you are.

Since the Puritans got a shock 
When they landed on Plymouth Rock. 
If today 
Any shock they should try to stem 
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock, 
Plymouth Rock would land on them. 

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking 
Was looked on as something shocking. 
But now, God knows, 
Anything goes. 
Good authors too who once knew better words 
Now only use four-letter words 
Writing prose. 
Anything goes. 
If driving fast cars you like, 
If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like, 
Why, nobody will oppose. 
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose 
Anything goes. 
When Rockefeller still can hoard en- 
Ough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows, 
Anything goes. 
The world has gone mad today 
And good's bad today, 
And black's white today, 
And day's night today, 
And that gent today

Once had several chateaux. 
When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
Lack baby clo'es, 
Anything goes. 

If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction 
Instruct Anna Sten in diction, 
Then Anna shows 
Anything goes. 
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up 
Now turns a handspring landing up- 
On her toes, 
Anything goes. 
Just think of those shocks you've got 
And those knocks you've got 
And those blues you've got 
From that news you've got 
And those pains you've got 
(If any brains you've got)

One night Frankie happened to pass by the hotel;
Just casually glanced into a window so high,
And who did she see but her lovin' man
Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!

Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop;
This time she didn't go there for fun!
'Cause when she left, underneath her long red kimono,
She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man
Who was doin' her wrong!

Then back Frankie dashed to that hotel,
Started yankin' the bell!
She said, ""Stand back, you madam and floozies,
Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!"".

Johnnie, in panic, mounted the staircase,
Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun,
The gun went, ""Root-toot-toot!"".
She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!

So they put her away in a dungeon,
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail,
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man
Who done her wrong!

But the day Frankie mounted the scaffold,
She was just as calm as any gal could be!

But you just flood my mind, good thoughts make my day worse
Wishing things could've been different, different without her!
If I can leave, then why can't I just go?
If I can leave, then why do I keep saying no?
If I can leave then why can't you leave too?
If I can leave, why can't I let go?

Etienne Callac,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

Etienne Daho,"Assez, ces pensées sont insensées
Glissées à mes oreilles glacées
Passez sous silence mon passé
Tissé de mensonges agacés
Entendu dans la lagune, les nuits de brume, je chante, la mer écoute
Des oiseaux fatigués sur moi se penchent, j'entends, rumeurs étranges
Les Dieux qu'invoquent des sorciers fous, sous les nuages
Et personne ne me croit
Assez, de ses épaules voilées
Assez, ses jupes ternes et froissées

Assez, faux sourires, sourcils froncés
Hissez, drapeaux et voiles, annoncez
Qu'entre les champs parfumés de musc et d'ambre et ma chambre, je l'invente
Ses yeux sur moi se posent
Lorsqu'elle pose sur le fond de champ de roses
Et attend, les lèvres closes
Dis-moi, dis moi que tu me croies
Entre les champs parfumés de musc et d'ambre et ma chambre, je l'invente
Elle avance vers moi, fière et sereine, un beau jour elle sera mienne
Elle serait reine et serait folle
Alors, dis moi, dis moi que tu me croies.",Musc et Ambre,1988

un jour intact les bonheurs passés
les alizés passeront les nuages lourds et l'oppressante obscurité
alors que moi je prendrai congé sans cérémonie
je disparaitrai dans la nuit

aucune larme dans nos yeux
des adieux très heureux
et sans regret s'éclipser
sans regrets s'éclipser
s'éclipser

entre les gouttes de pluie.

Attendre, rester calme,
que l'ondée soit finie.

Deux bons amis dans le temps,
perdent leurs traces et s'oublient.
Mais quand revient la nuit, en reve,
en souvenirs, sont réunis.
Uniike the night sky I can't find the way to join myself together.
Join the stars in me, into signs,
constellations and wonders.

Be brave,
tu es tout seul au monde.
Be brave,
tu es tout seul sur la terre.


Comment traverser cette nuit,
sans abri, sans lumière,
inondée de larmes, pour faire briller,
les lueurs matinales.

Chers souvenirs,
tenez-moi en éveil,
ou sans quoi,
je dormirai tous les jours,
jusqu'au dernier,
en promenade somnambule.

Be brave,
tu appartiens au monde.
Be brave,
tu appartiens à la terre.

How do you think most times?
I've been searching for some passion for my actions
Now you know that its full price

You know how and you know why
You’re not the bedroom type
Nightly fading, just what are you celebrating?
Old fashions burn your short fuse dry

Whatever this is, the pleasure's all his
Endlessly trailing my dreams
No need to pretend I want you instead
To council her excellency

Can’t be the first to say you're the worst
Surely there's one or two
I care more if you act as though you like me
Then if you really do

Living a lie to a song you can’t hide
The paintings are still in the tube
I needed to fall, you need not crawl
I punish myself with you

Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

Thy vacant brow, and thy tousled hair

Thou noble upright truthful sincere
And slightly dopey gent, you are...

My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable
Yet, you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?

Are you smart?

Like the tick, tick, tock

Like the drip, drip, drip,
Of the raindrops,
When the summer show'r is through;
So a voice within me
Keeps repeating,
You, you, you

Night and day
You are the one,
Only you 
Beneath the moon
And under the sun.
Whether near to me or far,
It's no matter, 
Darling, where you are

Night and day.

Day and night 
Why is it so,
That this longing for you follows
Where-ever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom,
In the silence of my lonely room,
I think of you,
Night and day.

Night and day
Under the hide of me

There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he, turns out to be
Someone to watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some

Why no one's beside you where I usually lay

There was nothing I wouldn't do
No matter the cost I was ready to pay
Now you say I'm only holding you down
Like some old rock you've been dragging around
Yes, I'm your rock but I'm rolling away

I'm rolling away on a downhill grade
But I'm coming to rest side
A mountain of love some day
'Cause I finally understand
If you're resting on shifting sands
Even a rock goes rolling away

But quickly drove away.

How it all got started, how it all begin
God made the heavens, God made the earth
Made a man and a woman out of blood, sweat and dirt
And He looked around the neighborhood
And He said to His self, ""This is good""

God made the rivers and the mountains with his hands
God made the wind to blow the shifting sands
He put the fishes in the, in the deep blue sea
Filled up the garden with flowers and the trees
And God looked around the neighborhood
And He said to His self, ""This is good""

But the devil he was jealous, took the apple in his hand
The devil tempted woman and woman tempted man
God, He mourned and the tears rolled down His face
It broke His heart to see His children fall from grace
And on the seventh day they say, ""God rested""
But you know that ain't the truth

Cause on the seventh day, God made the blue
Cause on the seventh day, God made the blue

The blues is been around ever since that day
Everybody gets the blues, everybody got to pay
For the wicked things we do
And what we put each other through
And on the seventh day they say, ""God rested""

No holes in your walkin' shoes

The main thing you're gonna find, you need
A fertile place to plant your seed

Gotta find somebody to love you
Someone to be there for you night and day
Somebody to share with, be a part of you
Love ain't no good till you give it away
You got to give it away

I got to recommend some Life Insurance
Be prepared to dial 911
Pay close attention to your high blood pressure
Stay away from the man with the gun

You need a reason to get up in the mornin'
Make sure the clock got snooze control
Be sure you got a place to run for cover
'Cause overnight things can get real cold

You're gonna find that sooner or later
You need a common denominator

You gotta find somebody to love
Someone to be there night and day
Someone to share with, be a part of you

And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it then I can do it

Think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away

I believe, I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly, I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence, it can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me

If I can see it, I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I could fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away

A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Etta Jones,"I used to love to hold you when the lights were down low
But it's all over now
You used to whisper little things to set me aglow
But it's all over now

I listened to you tell me little white lies
Never thought you meant to deceive
Whoever would have doubted those innocent eyes
And all the little kisses that you made me believe

Remember how I planned a little home by a stream
Where we?d spend every day
You must have thought me crazy when I painted that dream
'Cause you threw it away

I kinda wish that things would be different
Have a happy ending somehow
But I guess you only took me for a ride in the dark
And it's all over now

You called it our love refrain
It's gone and I'm left completely
Out in the cold again

I dreamed that our love would linger
But just memories remain
As I gaze at that ring-less finger
Out in the cold again

True, it hurts my pride to step aside for somebody new
But deep down inside my whole world depended on you

I wanted your arms around me
To shelter me from the rain
But now I'm back where you found me

So from now on I'm trav'lin' light.
He said goodbye and took my heart away,
So from today I'm trav'lin' light.

I'm free as the breeze,
No-one but me
And my memories.
Some lucky night he may come back again,
So until then I'm trav'lin' light.

Etta Jones,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember

Way down at Mister Joe's Cafe
They're takin' someone far away,
And if you hear a song today.
It's a sad tune that you'll be playin':
 
She's leavin' and folks are feelin' so low,
They're grievin' and they're consolin' poor Joe;
Gonna miss her song
Gonna miss her smile
She'll be travlin' alone down that last long mile
They're sighin'
With all their trouble and woes
They're cryin' 'cause they all loved

Etta Jones,"On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo

Etta Jones,"If I loved you
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know

If I loved you
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go

Longin' to tell you but afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances pass me by

Soon you'd leave me
Off you would go in the mist of day
Never, never to know
How I loved you if I loved you

If I loved you
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know

If I loved you
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Around in circles I'd go

Longin' to tell you but afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances pass me by

Soon you'd leave me
Off you would go in the mist of day
Never, never to know

How I loved you if I loved you
If I loved you, yes, if I loved you
Baby, if I loved you, oh, if I loved you

",If I Loved You,1963
Etta Jones,"You sigh, the song begins, you speak and I hear violins
It's magic
The stars desert the skies and rush to nestle in your eyes
It's magic

Without a golden wand or mystic charms
Fantastic things begin when I am in your arms

When we walk hand in hand the world becomes a wonderland
It's magic
How else can I explain those rainbows when there is no rain?
It's magic

Why do I tell myself these things that happen are all really true
When in my heart I know the magic is my love for you?

When we walk hand in hand the world becomes a wonderland

Etta Jones,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1963
Etta Jones,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you",Love Walked In,1963
Etta Jones,"Everyone knows him as old folks
Like the seasons he comes and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And his own corn cob pipe is so mellow, hits right
But you needn't be ashamed of him

In the evenings after supper
What stories he tells
How he held his speech at Gettysburg for Lincoln that day
You know I know that one so well

One thing we don't know about old folks
Did he fight for the blue or the gray?
But he's so democratic and so diplomatic
We always let him have his way

In the evenings after supper
What stories he tells
How he held his speech at Gettysburg for Lincoln that day
Yes, I know that one so well

Some day there will be no more old folks
What a lonely old world this will be
Children's voices at play will be still fonding
The day they take old folks away",Old Folks,1963
Etta Jones,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,1963
Etta Jones,"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat

Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away
I'll find my love some day

Death is no dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you
