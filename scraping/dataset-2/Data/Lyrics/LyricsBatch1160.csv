The Mills Brothers,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1990
The Mills Brothers,"Where's that tiger! Where's that tiger!
Where's that tiger! Where's that tiger!
Hold that tiger! Hold that tiger ! Hold that tiger! 
Choke him, poke him, kick him and soak him!
Where's that tiger? Where's that tiger?
Where oh where can he be?
Low or highbrow, they all cry now
""Please play that Tiger Rag for me""

The Mills Brothers,"Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
My luck is changing, it's gotten from 
simply rotten to something worse
Who knows, some day I will win too. 
I'll begin to reach my prime.

Now though I see what our end is,
All I can spend is just my time.

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile

I can't give you anything but love.

Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
But I am willing to wait, dear, 
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.

You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.

Please don't be blue for the present, 
When it's so pleasant to hear you say

I can't give you anything but love, baby.

The Mills Brothers,"People are queer, they're always crowing, scrambling and rushing about

Life is just a bowl of cherries
Don't take it serious, it's too mysterious
You work, you save, you worry so
But you can't take your dough when you go, go, go

So keep repeating it's the berries
The strongest oak must fall
The sweet things in life, to you were just loaned
So how can you lose what you've never owned?
Life is just a bowl of cherries
So live and laugh at it all

Life is just a bowl of cherries
Don't take it serious, it's too mysterious

There's a guy in the show, the girls love to kiss
Get thousands a week just for crooning like this

The Mills Brothers,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon
The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone",The Song Is Ended,1994

Sitting demurely 'neath the cherry blossom trees
Miss Butterfly's her name
A sweet little innocent child was she
Till a fine young American from the sea
To her garden came
They met beneath the cherry blossoms every day
And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with a soul 'twas easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

Poor Butterfly 'neath the blossoms waiting
Poor Butterfly, for she loved him so
The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears
She murmurs low
The moon and I
Know that he'll be faithful
I'm sure he'll come to me by and by
But if he won't come back
Then I'll never sigh or cry
I just must die

The melody haunts my reverie

When the stars were bright
You were in my arms
The nightingale tells it's fairy tale
A paradise where roses grew

In my heart it always will remain

The Mint Juleps,"On her way to work one mornin'
Down the path beside the lake,
A tender-hearted woman saw
A poor, half-frozen snake.
His pretty, colored skin had been
All frosted with the dew.
""Poor thing,"" she cried, ""I'll take you in
And I'll take care of you.""
""Take me in, tender woman.
Take me in for Heaven's sake.
Take me in, tender woman,""
Sighed the snake.
She wrapped him up
All cozy in a comforter of silk.
And laid him by the fireside
With some honey and some milk.
She hurried home from work that night
And soon as she arrived,
She found that pretty snake
She'd taken in had been revived.
""Take me in, tender woman.
Take me in for Heaven's sake.
Take me in, tender woman,""
Sighed the snake.
She clutched to her buxom.
""You're so beautiful,"" she cried.
""But if I hadn't brought you in
By now you might have died.""
She stroked his pretty skin again
And kissed and held him tight.
Instead of saying, ""Thanks,""
The snake gave her a viscous bite.
""Take me in, tender woman.
Take me in for Heaven's sake.
Take me in, tender woman,""
Sighed the snake.
""I saved you,"" cried the woman.
""But you've bitten me, but why?
You know your bite is poisonous

Like a butcher's wife should be
The children loved their baken lard was …. constantly
The dog chewed on old knee joints and gobbled congealed grease
The butcher had a credo that he liked to spread around
If you looking for a sausage well you've come to the right part of town
He laughed loud like a general and a clevo went up and down
And the days where long and rosy with never a sight of regret
When in to the shop came Kafka, boy he was definitely back form the dead 
I need a butcher for my new parable, and you perfect one he said
You'll wake up soon as a pig my friend, and not just in my book
I used a cockroach once before but nobody understood
A mob will chase you trough the street and track you in the wood
In the forest you'll find a clearing where all living things are save
You'll … yourself on berry's and sleep in a nearby cave
A simple life for a simple creature the rest of your natural days
So if you ever need a butcher hacking feet of off a pig
You better tell him about Kafka, you better tell him what Kafka did
He is a trouble making Czech clerk and he knows just where you live

And I will tell you where I was when I went down
Show me where the lines can reconnect
And I will parallelogram you to the ground

And the mine shaft's pretty deep
There's no mattress, no soft ground
And no film treatment for my life as a creep

I guess they should

Or the dark hand of contagion
Not some cruel comedy
Or a botched up engraving

I met you at Acadia
I tried wine and persuasion
It was just another dinner bought
By the dark hand of contagion

You drew it like a map in sand
Led us down the road to ruin
You said you tried to understand
You'd no idea what I was doing

Your wedding day was so well planned
Like a German occupation
I signed the note on your nightstand
'The Dark Hand of Contagion'

It said it's not too late
You still got time
And I hold that time like a handful of the sea
So you won't get rid of me so easily

It wasn't the wrath of God
I guess he was busy elsewhere
I took you 'round the family plot
Thought you might at least pretend to care

I would have given anything
Made any arrangement
Just to see you wear my ring

The Minus 5,"I started 
Playing guitar by the town memorial
All my songs were singing editorials
And when I'd done, the sermon on the mount
I counted my change and put it in my bank account
I didn't want to work at the local avatar
So I left home, expanded my repertoire
I did some gigs, No one booed
I got free beer and I drank it with gratitude

Once I started I couldn't stop
That's how I got from
The bottom to the top

A businessman with a very young dolly bird
Talked through the set, liked what he thought he heard
Dropped some names he claimed to represent
And asked me if I had any management
Well two weeks later, I'm signing on ??docubine??
Offered some drugs, at first I declined
Lots of parties where the spread's incredible
But don't get close 'cause the food's inedible

And I became a spinning top
That's how I got from
The bottom to the top of the bottom

I got a sweet deal and I moved to America
I fell in love with an heiress called Erica
Started out smart, soon got silly
I partied by the pool and then arrest for necrophilia
News travels fast like electricity
A bad mug shot, it's good publicity
I laid low for a month or two
And spent my dough building a recording studio

And that's when it all went pop
That's how I got from
The bottom to the top of the bottom

The label ??Empeola?? got me in the charts
My new management had me by the private parts
I went on strike, took the initiative
Forgetting that I didn't have a single thing to bargain with
I lost my nerve, my fall was glorious
The lawsuit was eternal and laborious
My new material was only fair to middling
Rome was burning and I did some fiddling

And finally, I was dropped
That's how I got back from
The bottom to the top of the bottom

On the way down people tend to leave you where you fall
I tried to stand up but I didn't have the wherewithal
I nearly died in a cab one day
So I swapped my bourbon for a bottle full of perrier
There were rumors about my sexuality
The video star, killed by reality
Next thing I know I'm on my knees
Begging the camera, ""Will you vote me off the island please?""

But the world forgives a flop
That's how I got back from
The bottom to the top of the bottom


O well all that exposure and the phone starts to ring again
I experienced the strange urge to sing again
Well not long ago I was a boy with a dream 
I reacquaint myself with a razor and some shaving cream
Look at me I'm ripe for rediscovery
All I need is Mary to mother me
On the tenth green I was way over par
My partner offered me a tour in ??Jesus Christ's Superstar??

And that's when the penny dropped
That's how I got back back from
The bottom to the top of the bottom

Well we toured all over the states of America
I got a picture of my son from Erica
My parents wrote, ""Since you disappeared,
Hard to believe but it's just been one year,""
Now it's back to ale and cakes again
I wonder if I'll make the same mistakes again
I hope that you've enjoyed this tutorial
There's another busker who was playing the memorial

I'm getting bored of talking shop
That's how I got back from
The bottom to the top of the bottom
To the top of the bottom
To the top of the bottom

The Miracles,"We were just kids playing in the rain
When you threw a stone
And you broke a window pane

You were so afraid of what you done
That I held your hand little one
And I wouldn't let you run

Then you turned to me
With a look of shame on your face
And your eyes asked a question ever so tenderly

Oh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Right then, I knew, how it would always be
Put the blame, put it on me

Ooh, at the age of twelve
You were a fine young thing
But I felt much older 'cause I had to shoulder
The trouble you'd bring

Like the time you pushed Sonny down
And she cried on me
With those same big eyes
You turned and you looked at me

Oh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Right then, I knew, how it would always be
Put the blame, put it on me
Put it on me, put it on me

Now you're all grown up
And you're running wild
And they're so surprised
'Cause all along you seemed
Like such a sweet child

And there's nothing but bad news
From old friends I meet
How you've become
A woman of the street

And they give me a million
And one reasons why
But when I analyze it
I know where the real fault lies

Oh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
No doubt about it, oh, this time rightfully
Put the blame, put it on me.

The dignity of labor upon a mans own land
The soil of his fathers passes on down through blood to hand
A mans right of birth to reap the harvest from his land

The breaking of his back to keep his dream alive
To work the change of season his instinct to survive
The planting of his seed and to see his harvest grow
Gives a pride to a man to reap the harvest that he sows

The heartland of pioneers, the heritage of flesh and blood

With a price to pay for the working man

They can take away his freedom they can beat him into the dust
They can burn his home, run him from his land,
And leave him out to gather rust
But they cant take away his faith and his honesty and pride
And the knowledge that he holds inside
One day they'll reap the harvest

And I can see years to come
I live for the burn and the sting of pleasure
I live for the sword, the steel, and the gun
I can tear down the walls, storm them barricades
Run to the place where the frightened crawl
Desire lurks beyond good and evil
So dance on the graves where the hammer falls

[Chorus]
Over this land
All over this wasteland
Over this land
All over this wasteland

You can touch, but please keep your distance
You're innocent and pure and with no shame
The spirit is willing, and the flesh is great
Your teasing your torment with the pleasure of pain

[Chorus]

Heaven and Hell, I know them well
But I haven't yet made my choice
I'm feeling dead 'cause I'm shouting loud
And no one can hear my voice
Walking the tight wire, can't look down
Strung out high, above you all
Faithful wind blows through this land
Howls my name, Hell is my fall.

For the sake of a wanton kiss?

There must be more than this
There must be more than this

I know you think you walk on water,
But have you ever walked on air?
Cast no aspersion, this ain't no desertion,
This is just calling it fair
And when temptation takes a hold of you,
How can you ever resist?
Would you throw this all away for the flick
Of a perfumed wrist?

Judge not lest ye be judged, let
He who has no sin throw the first stone
Shower me with flowers, place them on my grave
Give me the grace for the sins I atone

Lay my hands on the Bible and swear to
The good Lord above
I'll make amends for my sinful ways
and give myself up to your love

No more whiskey or whoring
Or fighting like an alley cat

Shivers down your spine chill you to the bone

A broken dream haunting in your sleep
And hiding in your smile a secret you must keep
Love cuts you deep

Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel

There's no scarlet in you, lay your veil down for me
As sure as God made wine, you can't wrap your arms
Around a memory
Take warmth from me, cold Autumn winds cut sharp
As a knife
And in the dark for me, you're the candle flame that
Flickers to life

Broken and torn crushed like the flower under the snow

Oh I softly call you over
When you appear there's nothing left of you

As he raises his hands to the sky
And the girl in the corner is everyone's woman

He was wounded for our transgressions,
bruised for our iniquity,
by His stripes we were healed,
as He hung there at Calvary.

He was lifted up from the earth,
in order to draw all men;
it was love that held Him there
and that same love covers our sins.

For God so loved the world, 
that He gave His only Son,
no greater love had been given to anyone.

The Son gave His life for the taking by men;
He had the power to lay it down,
He had the power to take it up again.

And they begin dancing!

When they hear a tune

Those weary blues can't get into my shoes,

To ever grow weary.
I keep cheerful on an earful
Of music sweet;

Some of these days you're gonna want me only,

The Missourians,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter

It's for your own good,

Bruv, you know what yeah, what experience?
What so you've gone mad over a chick.
Yeah I have once, and I'm not doing that shit again,
You're fucking crazy.

There's no point in telling her the truth,
Cos she's not gonna believe it.
You know what I mean,
She's just gonna listen to her friends,
Her fucking friends, you know what I mean.
So like, just like, forget about her, let's go get some drinks,
You know what I mean, go check some more yetis.

Bruv why did she hang up?
I know there's still anger
I put my hands up ? yes I was a wanker.
I did lead with Tanya, when I left Tantra,
She had one too many so I called a cab.
I don?t understand her, I never did grab her
She?s listening to Amber, and we don?t get on,
OK before, I did get caught,
But to jeopardise us again, I couldn?t do.

See me and Tanya we?re only just breadrins
Her friend, never saw anything
We got in, I dropped her off to her rents.

Are you sure your head ignores them?

So now she wants her and the girls to be a gang of spinsters.
And bruv, huh, I told you, you cant be chatting to Tanya.
So when she calls you, just blank her.
That night I went to Ten Rooms after Tantra,
But I didn?t think you and her would jump in the same cab bruv.

Maybe a couple of days, to get her mind straight.

Clipping Ryan in the box, that's a red
He was one on one with the keeper,
Have a word with the linesman flagging on your left,
I mean they should be playing with ten men,
He was well past the line, past defense,
What the fuck are they saying?
Come on what's the delay?
Send him off to the, the bench!
What do you mean he was fucking offside?
Ain't you flippin' opened your eyes?
He was through on the ball,
And his right foot to score in the top corner to equalize.
Ref he should be taking the spot kick,
Are you a fucking alcoholic?
You was meters away, mate give us a break,
We don't take it out of your pocket
That's fucking out of order ref, how come?
You were quick to book him, what has he done?
What do you mean for dissent and recent comments when?
I was just having some fun

He just shakes his head,
And fucking walks away,
There's ten minutes left,
It's always his way,
Every time we've met,
He's fucked up the day,
Without the referee it'd be a fairer game!

It's common sense lads, fucking common sense,
All the fucking balls stay on offense,
Defense, defend, we've only got twenty to go till the end,
What is the keeper playing at?
Stay on your fucking line, Matt stay on his back!
Fucking tackle! What do you mean your ankle?
Ref's pulling your leg, I can see from this angle.
That's not a fucking card. Fuck off, never!
He's not fucking hurt, he's trying to be fucking clever,
Hold your tongue Paul son, keep it together,
Or that could be you in the fucking black book.
And that's far from a fucking happy look,
We dropped down the drain, fancy getting some hooks
Fuck's sake is he off, or is he off the hook?
Only a fucking caution, nearly had me shook.
But a free kick in our direction,
Right at the edge of the box we'll need protection.
Oh shit El Guerro takes it in discretion,
Come on boys sort out your fucking selection

He places the ball,
Then goes takes six steps back,
There's a hole in the wall,
Someone please fill the gap,
If he fucking scores,
I'll be facing the sack,
Not to mention my head in the Sun getting axed.

Fucking hell keeper, keep on your toes,
He's gonna swing it up in the corner, here he goes,
On your right son, shit I can read his flow,
Its curling, its curling, don't let it go,
Oh fuck no. I fucking knew it.
I fucking knew it. We've gone and blew it.
At five on the clock we had the game in the bag,
Was winning the nag, now we're heading out,
Must have had the right idea, we're scratching our heads in doubt
I've gone down the drain, and another round,
When me and the lads all meet down the Flushing Dam,
Two minutes left, might as well check the oven now,
Who? Us? When? How? I mean who got fouled?

I never liked Dry Your Eyes anyways,
The only person that liked it was my mum,

The last time we was in here, we just lined with despair.
The pretty bird behind the till was flipping thru Marie Claire
Flicking the end of her hair, fidgeting, all nervous,
Had us thinking ?where the fuck is the customer service?!?
Must have been the flippin shabby overalls we?re wearing,
And the batch of Classics that were on the verge of tearing.
Cos Aunty?s front room needed redecorating,
So we painted it light blue to make it look more radiant.
But today that aint the case (na mate!)
It?s Lionel Scott cardigans, that us man were dreamt in
The pretty bird behind the till?s grin is so blatant,
And suckin man?s bottom, cos she must think we got the papers.
So from this day forth, we must always recall,
Never ever to come back in here in overalls,
Cos pretty birds behind tills, they don?t like to smile and talk,
To brehs bowling down in fucking overalls.

{Verse 2 ? Tony Mitchell}
It?s as if she?s never seen our mugs in here before,
Cos as soon as we was about to make a move, she released the door,
Pointing her finger at her assistant to attend to both of our needs,
Chucking an opener on the counter, strutting towards Teddy and me.
Now its all a guided tour through the Lacoste new seasons,
Compliments on our retirements, mixing offering us greetings (?).
Not to mention the welcome ? and the private seating,
That they usually use for the service twats,
With the request to them to bring the teas in.
But the other day, that weren?t the case.. na mate
It was her on the fone to the security guard,
To follow us for no damn reason.
Lookin down at our watch, giving us the cold shoulder treatment.
Asking us if we could hurry up cos they were closing early that evening.
So from that day forth, we have always remembered,
Never ever to wear overalls, its just absurd.
Cos overall, all over, overalls don?t work
Cos now that we?re in London its got the bird flicking up her skirt.

But when I gave her my autograph she said ?mum is this how u spell lemar??
When I shop at Harvey Nicks,
The security give me grief,
They must think I?m a thief, cos I don?t sound like The Streets.
Even when I?m just trying it on, they think I?m trying it on.
I said ?why would I steal from you? I?m loaded?
Then they called the police ? ?there?s a guy with a gun!?
Despite this, I like shopping here,
Cos it?s a lot quicker than eBay
I bumped into this Labour MP who was looking for a pair of CK,
I said ?Hi, I?m Sway, and I hope you?re having a nice day?
Then I slapped him in his face and said ?what type of party doesn?t have a DJ??
I remember the first time I came here,
I was shoplifting and got nabbed,
In the shop lift I got grabbed,
?Hey you! Excuse me, open your bag!?
I got put in a pair of handcuffs,
All for a pair of cufflinks,
I said ?please sir, don?t send me to prison, if its anything like Butlins?

I just want to be left alone so don't even bother me
Interrupt me and accuse me wrongfully
I ain't got the time so this is long for me

Twenty first of the fifth eighty five

You won't find a box of merch so spare me the time of the stop and search
Two black boys and they got a Merc
If it was stolen why would we stop the Merc?
You pulled us to try and find problems
Like Jay-Z and 99 Problems
I'm a bad boy anyway always got protection, 99 Condoms
Yeah officer, course I'm a thief, dealin lil drugs and my boot smell of weed

What do you mean routine check?

Sound like you routinely check
Any youths in jeans and creps
What do you mean routine check?
I didn't take this route to be checked
Sound like you routinely check
Any youths in jeans and creps

Oi oi I don't get many routine checks these days
But these bros are not the same
Apart from the day off that train from that Tottenham game
I do tend to end days in the police station
On occasion lately
Once a week
Maybe
I get a crime reference number for my most recent phone
The police code that's the code for a free phone
Take one camera phone
Tell em I got jacked of the phone
When in fact actually though
The previous evening back at home
I played baby foot
No-one jacked my phone
I madly gambled my phone and got smacked
By my bro

What do you mean routine check?

And he starts to swear a lot,
But she hasn?t bared a drop,
And thus?everyone stares too much

{Verse 1 ? Tony Mitchell}
Cor blimey, see that bird take a good look at her skirt,
Oh me word, I can see heaven take me far from Earth,
I?ll have some of that love, how much are you worth?
No I?m not being tricky love, this glass is me first,
Now how about a score, OK then 25,
Why did you slap me for, I was trying?a be kind,
Go get your boyfriend then, I ain?t gonna run,
So what if he?s a boxer, I?m already numb.
Now out of the way, its me turn ?same again son?
What did you say cunt, I?ll tell you when I?m done,
I?m drunk, you?re flippin drunk, in fact you?re raw some,
Come on then, lets have it then, now where the hells me gun?
Oh you all think it?s a joke, well lets just see,
When I count to three, you will all respect me,
Dead bag I Tony, everyone knows me,
What?s wrong now sweetheart, are we getting cold feet?

(CHORUS)

{Verse 2 ? Mike Skinner, Tony Mitchell, Teddy Mitchell}
Mike: Excuse me, can I have a word outside if you please
Tony: What if I refuse, what are you gonna do geez?
Mike: Oi, lets cut to the chase, did you disrespect me Stace?
Tony: Oh you mean that slag, she?s a bloody disgrace
I offered her 25, and she slapped me in me face
I mean, would you believe it Ted? Right in me face!
She?s lucky she didn?t get put right in her place,
That?s it, I?ve had enough, outside, come on lets go now!
Teddy: Listen bruv, that?s enough,
I?ll put it blunt, you?re looking like a cunt,
Breathe in, breathe out,
Or you?ll end up in the back of the meatvan
Like you always do when you have a glass of gin and juice,
Causing trouble in the venue,
What you trying to make the 10 o?clock news?
No, no, don?t talk, your ignorance will be a downfall,
What you gotta shout loud for,
Embarrassing yourself when you?re outdoors,
Talking like you got big balls,
Gritting your teeth like a pitbull,
Looking like you?re gonna be sick,
Dude check yourself mate, you?re a Mitchell

(CHORUS)

Please excuse my brother,
He?s got too much booze in his bladder,
Giving you all the chitter-chatter,
Getting all rude in a geezer manner.
Please accept my apologies on his behalf,
And I don?t think that he really meant to squeeze your arse,
But he was being an idiot,
That I can?t deny, I must admit,
That he was out of line, and he pushed it just a little bit
But what about you though, showing off flesh like a sumo,
Your skirts up too high, and your top?s cut too low,
And there?s your boyfriend, acting like a boss kinda like Hugo,
Put yourself in my brother?s shoes mate,
What if it was you bro?
Lets just all get along,
Do a little dance to some songs,
Forget about this nonsense,
We can all move on!

The Mitchell Brothers,"I big up the same place since back in stone age
This is my main stage I owe the whole space
Take it for free babes don't wait in vain chase
The slow center of the storm where everything lasts on

I ride on my wave no matter where I got it's there
I fly my light safe, I am declared I am aware that I am fool and brave
I build my thrones, I break my bones
I am my kingdoms rave, I never rest things move on fast

Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive
Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive

Slowly freakin' out, hear me now speakin' out
Won't be speakin' loud
How do you feel about listening to crazy men?
Whose minds, sneakin' out
A hazy sense of evidence for what life is all about

It's real love and everything, a family, no scattering
Daddy swing the children like Hollywood happy end
Just like so many men, I look for almost everything
Meanwhile whistling, here we go sing again

No matter how close to perfect it is
It's taken me too far, I'm afraid, I'm obsessed with it, vex with it
Good's not enough, be the best in it
In order to the best, I can never stop flexin' it

You flex it to the max and it feels like sex with it
It's made you to the boss and you feel you're blessed with it
Now everybody wants it, you start protecting it
This is when you wish you had no more stress with it, so

Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive
Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive

Going for a slowlife, almost understand

Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive

Going for a slowlife

The Mitchell Trio,"When I was just a wee little lad
Full of health and joy
My father homeward came one night
And gave to me a toy

A wonder to behold it was
With many colors bright
And the moment I laid eyes on it
It became my hearts delight

It went 'Zip' when it moved
'Bop' when it stopped
'Whirr' when it stood still
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will

The first time that I picked it up
I had a big surprise
For right on its bottom were two big button
That looked like big green eyes

I first pushed one and then the other
Then I twisted its lid
And when I set it down again
Here is what it did

It went 'Zip' when it moved
'Bop' when it stopped
'Whirr' when it stood still
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will

It first marched left, then marched right
Then marched under a chair
And when I looked where it had gone
It wasn`t even there

It started to cry and my Daddy laughed
For he knew that I would find
When I turned around my marvelous toy
Chugging from behind

It went 'Zip' when it moved
'Bop' when it stopped
'Whirr' when it stood still
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will

Now, the years have gone by
Too quickly it seems
I have my own little boy
And yesterday I gave to him
My marvelous little toy

His eyes nearly popped right out of his head
He gave a squeal of glee
Neither one of us knows just what it is
But he loves it just like me

It still goes 'Zip' when it moves
And 'Bop' when it stops
And 'Whirr' when it stand still

From a typical American town

And an keepin' old Castro down

And when it came my time to serve
I knew better dead than red
But when I got to my old draft board
Buddy, this is what I said

Sarge, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen
And I always carry a purse
I got eyes like a bat, and my feet are flat
My asthma's getting worse

Consider my career, my sweetheart dear
My poor old invalid aunt
Besides, I ain't no fool, and I'm goin' to school
And I'm workin' in a defense plant

I've got a dislocated disc and a racked up back
I'm allergic to flowers and bugs
And when the bombshell hits, I get epileptic fits
And I'm addicted to a thousand drugs

I got the weakness woes, I can't touch my toes
I can hardly reach my knees
And if the enemy ever came close to me
Well, I'd probably start to sneeze

Sarge, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen
And I always carry a purse
I got eyes like a bat, and my feet are flat

But I think you gotta see
That if someone's gotta go over there
That someone isn't me

So, have a ball, Sarge, watch 'em fall
Yeah, kill me a thousand or so
And if you ever get a war without any gore
Well, I'll be the first to go

And I always carry a purse
I got eyes like a bat, and my feet are flat

I got to water my rubber tree plant

Funeral Directors of America, I am very deeply honored standing here;
Receiving this token of your esteem, ""The Funeral Director of the
Year.""
Now I've been asked by all the delegates--and members of the board,
To tell you of the funeral that won me this award.
It was handled with taste and dignity, that much I can say for it;
And I'm sure it will take the family twenty years to pay for it!

[Chorus:]
It was a helluva fun'ral, It was a helluva fun'ral
The finest fun'ral ever booked:
I had some high school juniors who passed around petunial
And lilies everywhere you looked.
It was a helluva fun'ral, I say one helluva fun'ral
Oh, how I wish that you were there;
I had ten drum majorettes doubling on the castanets
It really was a lively affair
It really was a lively affair.
It was a helluva fun'ral, It was a helluva fun'ral
The national guard showed up for me;
And during the oration, they went into formation
And formed the letters R. I. P.
It was a helluva fun'ral, I say one helluva fun'ral
I gave it all my loving care;
The band was on its toes playing ""Mexicali Rose"",
It really was a lively affair.
It really was a lively affair.
A tisket a tasket, Tell us about the casket

Well, I'll tell you 'bout the casket, my good friends
It would-a made your poor eyes pop
It was sterling silver all around and a real formica top.
(Formica top, it had a formica top).
Well, I'll tell you 'bout the widow, my good friends,
The widow was in navy blue
With a gown designed by Balenciaga, I supplied that too.
(He sold the widow widow's weeds too).
I held the first funereal raffle, though I don't much like to boast
And I gave away a Chevrolet to the person who cried the most.
(He gave away a brand new Chevrolet). I won it myself!
There were eighteen jugglers by the grave to demonstrate their art
And when they were done, I fired a gun to let the hoot-e-nanny start.
(He fired a gun and the hoot-e-nanny begun).
I was serving beer and prtzels, 'til the hot pastrami came;
And I sold some souvenir hankies with the dear departed's name.

As a fitting finale we had the Rockettes from New Your's Music Hall;
As you can see, my very good friends

Can't find a woman who's nice and pretty
They all look like page in a magazine
Legs are long and they eat like a sparrow
Figures stick to the straight and narrow
Top and the bottom are same as in between

Show me a pretty little number
When she walks it rolls like thunder
Eyes as deep and dark as the deep blue sea
Round right here and round right there
Pretty red lips and her very own hair
Wrap her up, she's the natural girl for me

Way down in a coffeehouse palace
Found a little lady and her name was Alice
She had friends and her friends had her it seems
Face was dirty and her sweater was baggy
Pants were tight and her hair was shaggy
I've seen her kind on college football teams

Show me a pretty little number

Eyes as deep and dark as the deep blue sea
Round right here and round right there
Pretty red lips and her very own hair

Thirteen miles up above the city
I met a little lady from a wealthy family
Now she could cuss like a real longshoreman
She was making eyes at the doorman
She made a most unusual offer to me

Show me a pretty little number
When she walks it rolls like thunder
Eyes as deep and dark as the deep blue sea
Round right here and round right there
Pretty red lips and her very own hair
Wrap her up, she's the natural girl for me

Way up at a Broadway party
I met a lady, she was very arty
She took me home to see her studio
She took out her paints and she whispered to me
She said that she wanted to 'do' me
Some of that paint will never come off, I know

Eyes as deep and dark as the deep blue sea
Round right here and round right there

He's the diamond of the land and he rolls around in clover

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

Oh, the horses they were all brought out with saddle, whip and bridle
The gentlemen did shout when they saw the gallant riders
And some did shout, ""Hooray"" and the air was filled with curses
On the mare, Griselda, the sportsmen lay their purses

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

Oh, the trumpet it did sound, and they shot off like an arrow

?Oh the gray will win the day, and Stewball, he can foller?

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

In the middle of the track, up spoke the noble rider
?I fear we must fall back, that gray is runnin' like a tiger?
Up spoke the noble horse, ""Ride on, ride on my master
We're only half way round the course, and now we'll see who's faster?

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

And as they did discourse, ol' Stewball flew like lightnin'
He dashed around the course, and the gray mare she was taken
Ride on, ride on, my noble horse for a good two hundred guineas
Your saddle, it shall be of gold when we pick up our winnings

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

Well, past the winning post, bold Stewball went so handy
And both the horse and rider called for sherry, wine and brandy
They drank to that gray mare, the gallant Miss Griselda
And to all who lost their money on the sporting plains of Kildare

Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low

The Mitchell-Ruff Duo,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening

Alone where we have walked together

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

But lie and bed and, 
Wonder how it was always up to you, 
And no one else and,
Early mornings, made by warnings, 
What's the point of the alarm 
That I'm ignoring?
It's even raining, 
I'm not complaining, 
But waking up is hard to do so

Turn my head 
Its back to bed with no delay, 
Can't be bothered by the phone 
Ten times a day, 
Why get up 
When my morning doesn't even start till two
Forget reality waking up is hard to do.

Remember when we would hang out every day, 
And we would rather,
Not be told what to do or what to say, 
Cause nothing mattered.
Never boring with slept in mornings, 
Not ashamed of bad habits that I'm forming.
Its not important if days are shortened, 
I can't make time when nothings new,
Cause waking up is hard to do so

Turn my head its back to bed with no delay, 
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day, 
Why get up my morning doesn't even start till two?
Forget reality waking up is hard to do.

What's a day when it all ends up the same, 
And lasts forever?
Can't complain 
When there's nothing there to blame, 
And things can't be better.
Summer evenings, teenage grievings, 
Got no problem with the life that I've been leading.
No concentration on hesitation, 
I can't make time when nothings new, 
Cause waking up is hard to do so

When you're down it's a thrill to go up again.

We were that Jack and Jill that came down a hill,
When I looked at you my hearttook a spill
Took a spill on a hill

There were sunbeams in the snow
and a twinkle in your eye

that you nearly passed me by

Then It Happened In Sun Valley
when you slipped and fell and so did I
Now ev'ry year we go back
and then we recall that fall and that moment
When we were there on a hill
So we both take a spill and we're Jack and Jill again.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

With Guns of love brought into battle
The nights will burn like never before.
Pride will fall and foundations rattle
When guns of love put an end to war

I don't mean to say we shouldn't do our part
But when it comes time to choose our weapons
Tell me what's to keep us from reaching for the heart
You know how strong a little love can be
So try and imagine all the power you'll see

I don't understand why nothing changes
We take the same roads time and time again
We let it all ride on pride and vengeance
Knowing it's a game nobody's gona win
So bet all you're anger if that's what you choose
But nothing's gonna change, everybody's gonna lose

He made the mountains, the deserts and the plains

That there'd be earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes

How could it turn so dark and be so cruel
This old world is full of imperfections
But I found one exception to the rule 

When God made you
He had something else in mind
When God made you
He took a little extra time 

When we're surrounded by a world that's slowly sinking
Your gentle eyes and loving smile make me forget
Though you're only flesh and blood, I can't help thinking
If you have a flaw, I haven't found it yet.

Givin' options for head knockin' non stoppin'
Tip-toppin' lyrics we droppin' but styles can be forgotten
So we bring back the raw hip-hoppin'
Just like the records and tapes you be coppin'
Cop some breakdancin', boogie poppin', and lockin'
Tic tockin', guaranteed to have you clockin
We only get better and only better we have gotten

Beware, the length of the rhyme flow can be shockin'

That never understood the way that krs got down
Yo I'm strictly about skills and dope lyrical coastin'
Relying on talent, not marketing and promotion
If a dope lyrical flow is a must
You gots to go with a name you can quickly trust
I'm not sayin' I'm number one, uhh I'm sorry, I lied
I'm number one, two, three, four and five
Stop wastin' your money on marketing schemes
And pretty packages pushin dreams to the beams

Tight an good, come is it tight an good

All in yo' ass crack, old king go blast dat
Conjure to ask dat, hyper type of flashback
I publish like ascap lyrics for hand clap
No past rappin', youth trackin', talent lackin'
Mc's more worried about their financial backin'
Steady packin' a gat as if something's gonna happen
But it doesn't, they wind up shootin' they cousin, they buggin'
I appear everywhere and nowhere at once
I know my style is bumpin', even though some people front
It's the god of rap, you heard of it
The one that rhymes toward the sky givin' airplanes mad turbulence
In rap tournaments, I reign permanent
Don't you think by now the number one spot I'm not concerned with it
The course of rap I'm turnin' it
Back to that good old fashioned way of getting cash money by earning it
No bogus hocus pocus, I bring back to focus
Skills if you notice my position is lotus
Now quote this, mc's are just hopeless
Thinkin' record sales make them the dopest

I have no more than I did before
But now I've got all that I need
For I love you and I know you love me

Play, magic fingers
Eee haa
Oh, pick up losers

For I love you and I know you love me

The Monkees,"Monday had a sad child
Always feeling low down,
Tuesday had a dream child
She's always on the go
Now I'm in love with Saturday's child
She drives me wild
Gonna spend my time
Makin' sure that Saturday's child is mine.

If you love a Wednesday
You'll live your life apart now
And if you love a Thursday
She's gonna break your heart,
So I'm in love with Saturday's child
She drives me wild
Gonna spend my time
Makin' sure that Saturday's child is mine.

Seven days of the week made to choose from
But only one is right for me
I know that Saturday's got what it takes, babe.
I can tell by the way she looks at me

Friday likes the good life
She'll take you for a ride now
And Sunday makes a good wife
But she wants to be a bride
So I'm in love with Saturday's child
She drives me wild
Gonna spend my time
Makin' sure that Saturday's child is mine.",Saturday's Child,1966
The Monkees,"I guess I should have stayed in bed,
My pillow wrapped 'round my head.
Instead of waking up to find 
A nightmare of a different kind.
She went away,
This just doesn't seem to be my day.

She didn't have to say a lot,
Her pretty eyes revealed the plot.
'Twas someone else she want more,
And so I walked her to the door.
What can I say?
This just doesn't seem to be my day.

My, oh my, how sad am I.
How I wish she would have stayed
This just doesn't seem to be my day.

My whole world is upside down,
She turned my smile into a frown.
It's such a pity the shape I'm in,
I must get on my feet again.
Can't stay this way

The Monkees,"A distant night bird mocks the sun.
I wake as I have always done,
To freshly scented sycamore
And cold bare feet on hardwood floor.
My steaming coffee warms my face
I'm disappointed in the taste.
But there's a peace the early brings
The morning world of growing things.

I feel the moments hurry on
It was today, it's died away,
And now it is forever gone.
And I will drink my coffee slow
And I will watch my shadow grow
And disappear in firelight
And sleep alone again tonight.",Early Morning Blues and Greens,1967

The Monkees,"You tell me that you've never been this way before
You tell me things I know that I've heard somewhere
You're standing in the places and you're staring down through faces
That bring to mind traces of a girl, a girl that I knew somewhere

I just can't put my finger on what it is
That says to me, watch out, don't believe her
I can't give any reasons girl, my thoughts are bound down in a whirl
I just can't think who in the world was that girl, I know I met her somewhere

Someway, somehow this same thing was done
Someone, somewhere did me this same wrong

Well goodbye dear, I just can't take this chance again
My fingers are still burning from the last time
And if your love was not a game, I only have myself to blame
That's as maybe, I can't explain, just ask the girl that I knew somewhere
