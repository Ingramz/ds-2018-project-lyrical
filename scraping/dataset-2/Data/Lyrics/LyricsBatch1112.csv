Ben Green,"Oh, it's a cold
Cold stone wall
One hand
One face against the wall
I watch the people and they're 
Each weighing their private losses
And the cold sweet morning air
Surrounds a crop of blank white crosses
I'm reading 
I'm not believing
they're all just names on a wall
They were once living hey were
Once breathing now
they're all just names
Names on a wall
Oh, I press my ear against the wall
I hear a helicopter, a bomb explode
I hear the echoes of a thousand souls
And then one young face
He says to me
Please remember me
I want to set him free
But all I see are
Blank white crosses stretched out to infinity
Chorus
Hey Johnny
Can you hear your momma call?
Hey Johnny
She leaves the light on in the hal
Chorus",Names on a Wall,2002
Ben Green,"I sit at my window watching the rain
Counting the cars on Riverside
I wish we were on a plane in the blue skies baby
Looking down on the clouds and the rain
From the other side

[Chorus]
Take me to paradise
Let’s go away
Take me to paradise

Somewhere someone is taking it slowly 
Someone is lying under the sun
I wish we could get away to those blue skies, baby
Maybe we could forget all the reasons we wanted to run

[Chorus]

I wish we could find a place 
Where you and I would be the only ones
It’s just you and me, It’s just you and me

[Chorus]",Paradise,2002
Ben Green,"Do you think that I would love you if I were famous
How 'bout if somebody made me king
Why can't you say that I already rule the world
And no one else could give me anything

Do you think that I would leave you for somebody better
Do you think that I want someone new
Why can't you see that I've got everything
And I can't go any farther without you

Without you there's no finding joy in sadness
Silver linings don't appear on any clouds
And there ain't no finding any sense in madness
Without you only emptiness surrounds me

Do you think I don't hear you when you're calling
Have I given any reason for concern
Why can't you see that I hear everything
What I don't understand I'll try to learn

Without you I've got nothing to go back on
'Cause this house could never really be a home 
And there ain't no one to light up this darkness
Without you I just stand alone

Just me baby
I only want to give you everything you need
Don't you know when you go that I'm the one who bleeds
Without you there's no finding joy in sadness

Silver linings don't appear on any clouds
And there ain't no finding any sense in madness
Without you only emptiness surrounds me",Without You,2002
Ben Haenow,"I had a dream the other night
About how we only get one life
Woke me up right after two
Stayed awake and stared at you
So I wouldn't lose my mind

And I had the week that came from hell
And yes I know that you can tell
But you're like the net under the ledge
When I go flying off the edge
You go flying off as well
And if we're only here once I wanna live with

You've got something I need
In this world full of people there's one loving me
And if we only here once (hey)
I wanna live with you (you, you, you)
You've got something I need
In this world full of people there's one loving me
And if we only here once (hey)
I wanna live with you (you, you)

Last night I think I drank too much
Call it our temporary crutch
With broken words I've tried to say
Honey don't you be afraid
If we've got nothing we've got us
And if we're only here once I wanna live with

You've got something I need
In this world full of people there's one loving me
And if we only here once (hey)
I wanna live with you (you, you, you)

I know that we're not the same
But I'm so damn glad that we made it
To this time, this time, now

You've got something I need
In this world full of people there's one loving me
And if we only here once
I wanna live with you, yeah

You've got something I need
In this world full of people there's one loving me
And if we only here once (hey)
I wanna live with you (you, you, you)

You've got something I need
In this world full of people there's one loving me
And if we only here once (hey)
I wanna live with you (you, you, you)
And if we only here once (hey)
I wanna live with you
And if we only here once
I wanna live with you",Something I Need,2015

And I think you find the best of me

You’re so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey, (Hey hey)
Hey Mickey (Hey, hey)

Oh, Mickey, you’re so fine (You’re so fine and you’re mine)
I’ll be yours till the end of time
'Cause you make me feel
Yeah, you make me feel
So shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time (Touched for the first time)

Like the one in me
That’s O.K.
Let’s see how you do it
Put up your dukes
Let’s get down to it

Hit me with your best shot
Why don’t you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away

Na na na come on
Na na na na na, come on, come on, come on

'Cause I may be bad but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don’t care I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it

Sex baby,
Let’s talk about you and me
Let’s talk about all the good things and the bad things that may be
Let’s talk about sex (Alright)
Let’s talk about sex (A little bit, a little bit)
Let’s talk about sex, baby

Baby, all through the night, I’ll make love to you,
Like you want me too

(And I) And I guess it’s just the woman in you,
That brings out the man in me
I know I can’t help myself
You’re all in the world to me

It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time
It feels like the first time

It’s going down fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me collab creations bump, like acne
No doubt, I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch, a dog couldn’t catch me, straight up
Tell me who could stop when Dre making moves, attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers (Shorty get down)

Good Lord
Baby got them open up all over town
Strictly biz she don’t play around
Cover much ground got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can’t get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby

(Girl)I like the way you work it,
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby,

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up , babe

To heal a mile of pain

The cure and the disease
But life is trying to force me, force me to trust

We walk in the same direction

Than you have got to set them free
But I would rather be locked to you
Than live in this pain and misery

Make all this go away

And turned them into yesterdays
And once again that rising sun is droppin' on down
And once again you my friend are nowhere to be found

Out where the pines grow wild and tall
I was trying to make it home through the forest
Before the darkness falls
I heard the wind rustling through the trees
And ghostly voices rose up from the fields
I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path [way]
With the devil snappin' at my heels
I broke through the trees and there in the night

My father's house stood shining hard and bright
The branches and brambles tore my clothes and caused me harm
But I ran till I fell shaking in his arms
I awoke and imagined the hard things that pulled us apart
Will never again sir, tear us from each other's hearts
I got dressed and to that house I did ride
From out on the road, I could see its windows shining in light
I walked up the steps and stood on the porch
A woman I didn't recognize spoke to me through a chained door
I told her my story, and who I'd come for
She said ""I'm sorry, son, but no one by that name lives here anymore""

My father's house shines hard and bright
It stands like a beacon calling me in the night
Calling and calling, so cold and alone
Shining cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned

To live my life without you?

I live a hundred lifetimes in a day.
But I die a little
In every breath I take.

Parting word you never say.
I put I put your world
Into my veins

Is all that remains.

But forgetting to feel 
Daily breath shouldn't be a daily penance

They all want you to serve them 
But the only one you got to serve 
Is your soul 

So much time 
And at such a cost 
We spend looking for what we've lost 
Now that you know 
You can't find it from him 
You're gonna have to find it within 

I look into the mirror 
And I see that life has taken its toll 
They'll all want you to serve them

Come stai quanto costa che ore sono che succede
Che si dice chi ci crede allora ci si vede
Ci si sente soli dalla parte del bersaglio
E diventi un appestato quando fai uno sbaglio

Un cartello di sei metri dice
""è tutto intorno a te""
Ma ti guardi intorno e invece non see'è niente
Un mondo vecchio che sta insieme solo grazie

A quelli che
Hanno ancora il coraggio di innamorarsi
E a una musica che pompa sangue nelle vene
E che

Fa venire voglia di svegliarsi e di alzarsi
E di smettere di lamentarsi
E' quello di non riuscire più a sentire niente
Di non riuscire più a sentire niente

Il battito di un cuore dentro al petto
La passione che fa crescere un progetto
L'appetito la sete l'evoluzione in atto
L'energia che si scatena in un contatto

Ben Harper & the Innocent Criminals,"I knew a girl 
Her name was truth 
She was a horrible liar. 

She couldn't spend one day alone 
But she couldn't be satisfied. 

When you have everything, 
You have everything to lose. 
She made herself 
A bed of nails 
And she's plannin' on puttin' it to use.

In a nasty world,so shines the good deed 
Make sure the fortune, that you seek 
Is the fortune you need. 

So tell me why,the first to ask,is the last to give, every time 
What you say and do not mean 
Follow too close behind

Like a soldier standing long under fire 
Any change comes as a relief. 
Let the giver's name remain unspoken

She wore diamonds on the inside

As she walked up to the wall
In her hand she held some flowers
As her tears began to fall

She took out a pen and paper
As to trace her memories
She looked up to Heaven 
And the words she said were these

She said, ""Lord my boy was special
And he meant so much to me""
And oh I'd love to see him
Just one more time you see

All I have are the memories
And moments to recall

And being home on Christmas day""

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.

""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break!

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,

",Where Do We Go,2007
Ben Jones,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle in the night
In the mist of a memory
You wander all back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

In the still of the night
Once again I hold you tight
Tho' you're gone your love lives on when light beams
And as long as my heart will beat
Sweet lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams

I could live without love

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Cursing all the miles and the nights we spend alone

Rock of Ages
Let our song praise your saving power;
You amid the raging foes,
Were our sheltering tower
Furious they assailed us,
But your arm availed us,
And your word broke their sword,
When our own strength failed us.
And your word broke their sword,

We've been on the mountain
We've been round the fire

In fancy hotels
Drank water from farm wells
We sang with the choir

I kissed your dry lips
We jumped off the high cliffs
And splashed down below

Skin to skin
In the salty river
Made love in the shadows
Whoa oh

Read books to each other
Read the mind of the other
Flew one thousand jets

We laughed and we cried
At movies and real life
And all our ridiculous bets

We danced in the moonlight at midnight
We pressed against back doors and wooden floors
And you never faked it

And frequently
We ignored our love
But we could never mistake it, oh oh

We met on the front porch
Fell in love on the phone
Without the physical wreck

You gave me the necklace
That used to hang
Around your mothers neck

We questioned religions
Gave bread to the pigeons
We learned how to pray

We stood by the ocean
Turned our hearts into one
We laid in bed all day, hey

We skipped on the sidewalk
Skipped stones on the water
We skipped town

We've seen the sunrise with new eyes
We've seen the damage of gossip and true lies
We've seen the sun go down

Had passionate make outs
With passionate freakouts
We built this world of our own

And that I wasn't alone",Thirteen,2006

Tried to forget the fact that they both came from the same womb

Now they don't know each other at all
You thought that they'd grow closer with age
You were mistaken, they'll go to their graves apart

Never missing the sister that they never knew

Maybe the friendly sibling myth is a scam
I don't know any siblings that walk around holding hands
Maybe we all expect too much of them
Not only to be sisters but also to be friends

I could have been an athlete could have trained all the time
Been just like the others could have left them behind
But I was too lazy I could not see ahead

I could have been a painter painting life in a rush

Instead I wasted my time

So we sink into our closed eyed painful hole

So I kiss you, say I'll call you
Then I tell you so much I don't understand
Then you kiss me with an answer
And my question seems invalid
And I go to bed with daisies in my hand

I call you there's no answer
But I know I have to see you
So I call and call and call and call again
But you never get my message
Or you choose not to return it
Because you shouldn't, needn't, wouldn't or just can't

I'm lonely and I love you
For the moment that is what's true in me
I've known you now forever
Joined at the soul together

There'll be no way to avoid you
When I see you in the movies
And I realize right now you're not here with me
If I'll see you in my lifetime
If again I'll feel you kiss me
I suppose that I'll just have to wait and see

But for now I'll just be grateful
To be touched by such an angel
And put it down as life experience
That my muse is just a daisy
With the most beautiful nature
Will one day fall back in my flower bed

And I know you said you love me
And that's the only memory left for me
Cause I need you more than ever

Ben Lee,"If you were here I'd slap you senseless
Then I'd ask you where you've been
I'd tell you don't you know I worry
Sitting up each night in fear
And then I'd tell you that I'm angry
And I'd say you did me wrong
And that I hate you 'cos you sneak into
My every single song

If you were here you'd see the damage done
And then you'd feel the shame
I'd make you understand my pain

If you were 'round I'd show you wounds and scars
The proof that you were here
And then I'd make you cry like I did
If my point still was not clear
If you were here I'd scream and
Maybe trash the room if I had time
And then one single word would break your spirit
Just the same as you broke mine

If you were here you'd realize what you did
Stay for a million years
I'd make you cry my tears

And I'm not strong

Saying that he can't explain
Maybe it's a meteor nuclear bomb missile launch
A final plague acid rain

And you must not leave your home
There'll be millions of people all around the world

I'm gonna smash my favorite guitar
Burn every book I've ever read
Then I'm gonna gather all my friends together
We'll get drunk and we'll get high
And then we'll chain smoke cigarettes
It doesn't matter Cause we're all gonna die

I'm gonna tear down the main city street
In a stolen police car
Record the world's trashiest song
And make myself a star
Then I'm gonna come back home and sit and think
About every word I've said
Take a photo of myself as a souvenir
Cause by the end of the day I'll be dead

And then I'll come round to your place
With a flower and a song
I'm gonna rest my tired head in your lap
And cry about all the things I've done wrong
Then I'm gonna look at you just one last time

Sometime in 1995
The other half of the world
The other side

It might have been warm outside, maybe cold
Who could tell? 
Three of us stumbled into room 421
At the grammercy park hotel

It's 3 am in new york
We sat for a while
We started to talk
We started to smile

Then he played a song I knew very well
3 am in new york
At the grammercy park hotel

He passed the guitar around
Over and over and over again
Till one of us broke a string
It was probably him

But the songs came out strong
They were loud, they were long
There were songs about girls, about boys
Sung a lot, screamed a lot
We made lots of noise

It's 3 am in new york
It's the time of my life
Minstrels and maidens and heartbroken songs
Made me cry

And we were anonymous, androgynous
Bearers of truth
And the indie rock columnists would have freaked out
If they knew

It's 3 am in new york
And I knew we were right
We were young, not so young
And in love with our lives

3 am in new york
I went back to bed
Three lone true prophets
With songs in our heads

It's 3 am in new york
And I just felt god
Lying awake in the dark
I was in awe

And I know in reality
It might not be true
But for three of us here in new york
It's all we could do

I know it's just songs, played on guitars
It's not rocket science, flying to mars
And I know it's not much, but it's all that I have
To be sure that I'm real
Again and again

And if there comes a day
When my fingers don't work
Or my voice loses sound
Gives me grief, gives me hurt
Well, I swear on that day
When I lose what's worthwhile
From that day forth I never shall smile

I feel fine, I feel well

And now it's just a lesson I can't grasp
So what's really the best that I could do
To hope to see you every year or two

Do they still make sense
Could you mean them now
Did you even mean them then
I could torture myself insane and tense

To walk and fish and write some songs, to stay up late and drink
And if I stay there long enough then I'll never feel a thing

And ketchum will be good to you if are strong and brave
She caters to the melancholy every single day
And babbles like a drunk old man unloading all his pain

I'll lock myself in ketchum's stare I'll make her my whole world
I'm gonna roam the ketchum streets to find a ketchum girl
And then I'll let her break my heart 'cos that's all that I do well

The valley will become my home her hills will keep me safe
I'll give her songs about my soul when there's no soul left to take
And I'll forget I ever lived in any other place

And it may seem inevitable I would love this fate
So beautiful and tragic and her heroes can't escape
And hemingway he shot himself one july evening late

Ben Lee,"I pass a town without a name
Seen through the window of a train
A boy and girl stand side by side
The train arrives, she kisses him goodbye

She turns away then steps on board
He thought he'd die but now he's sure
But as he thinks of one last thing to say
The train just rolls away

I pass a station with no sign
An old man gets on the train just in time
He used to love this town despite the rain
But since his wife died it's not been the same

He curses himself, he was weak
At his wife's grave he could not speak
But as he thinks that maybe he should stay
The train just rolls away

The driver likes his coffee strong and hot
The train he drives is everything he's not
He watches the sad people board the train
Then laughs as he pulls out and rolls away

Hits a hundred, no holding back
Then his dear train comes off the track
The news report said instant death, no pain
But who's really to say?

But who's really to say?
The train just rolled away
The train just rolls away

I feel like I've heard it all before
With a whole life ahead to hear a whole lot more

You wouldn't believe half the things I've seen
Way too much for just 18
I've written songs about them all so far
And played them all on an acoustic guitar

Trying to find someone to share it with

I said that's what I hoped

I admitted I was scared to you
I said I couldn't sleep
I told my jokes and they were bad
You laughed to humor me

Till you were just another face

Red eyes, wet hair
I looked across the circle

Inside I nearly cried

Ben Lovett,"I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jests
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Lie la lie...

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there

Lie la lie...

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Leading me, going home.

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remains

So listen now and hear me speak:

The stars look down and witness.
Erase the spreading sickness.

You can't see it with your eyes because they are rolling back.
You're about to have a heart attack.
Human depravity, suffering and torture.
Co-existence maimed at the slaughter.
Your souls are like one another;
Your veins are similar in colour.
This land wasn't yours to keep.
Wake up fools from your ignorant sleep.

The stars look down and witness.
Erase the spreading sickness.
You're so far gone that you can't see
Your place in hell is guaranteed.

I stand tall, feet firmly planted on the solid ground.
Separation now leaves you to sink and slowly drown.
Unmarked graves for those who have disgraced our name.
Devastate? Eradicate? The human race is the same in every way.

I stand tall, feet firmly planted on the solid ground.
Separation now leaves you to sink and slowly drown.

Separation will never advance us.
Discriminate, you will never rebuild trust.
We're born the same over time. Your open mind changed.
We're all brothers, so you need to look upon others in the same light.
Just 'cause you're white doesn't mean you can excuse this ignorant fight.
And the same if you're black no racist attack is justified.
Supremacy, just a lie.

Does it matter about the colour of skin?
Stop wasting your time.You're fighting a fight that you won't win.
Diminish this ignorance and get a grip. Settle in.
You're controlled by the hype, abusive and threatening
Towards another brother that wants to be here and fit in.
Grown up around mixed-race kids, we see no difference,
So why discriminate him? Hatred based on appearance.
You need to erase this spreading sickness.

The stars look down and witness.
Erase the spreading sickness.
You're so far gone that you can't see
Your place in hell is guaranteed.",Erase,2015
Ben Mazué,"J'suis pas vraiment jaloux, non mais
Il a la vie plus facile que moi
J'suis pas vraiment jaloux, non mais
(Lui il a tout) et moi j'ai quoi ?

J'ai, non, j'ai  pas vraiment pensé à tout ça
Moi j'avais mordu a l'hameçon
On m'avait dit tu va voir, la rate pas celle-là
C'est la meilleure des saisons
L'été c'est comme une douceur permanente et
Le soleil pour combustion
Chauffera tes envies naissantes
Et propulsera ta vie c'est bon
Alors me voilà le cul posé dans le sable en juillet
Le torse plus blanc qu'une écorce dans la chair de coco
Corps dodu d'ado habitué
Aux gros manteaux et à la ville bitumée
Alors que lui je le vois sortir de l'eau
Son air ravi...
La peau tirée par le sel, brunie par le soleil
Les cheuveux blond caramel
Toujours décolorés en somme
Au bout toujours jaune
Pour dire c'est la mer qui m'a fait
Pas les chromosomes !
Lui il claque un sourire
Y a déjà six filles dans son lit
Entre Hossegor, la Gwada, Maurice et puis Bali
Il m'a même pas calculé
Et toutes mes copines sont scotchées
Les yeux collés au V. de son ventre et de son dos
Pendant que je passe une fois de plus
De la crème sur ma peau

J'suis pas vraiment jaloux
Il a la vie plus facile que moi
J'suis pas vraiment jaloux
Lui il a tout, et moi j'ai quoi ?

C'est l'hiver et le froid vient toquer à mes pompes
Je subis
On peut rien faire contre ça
Dire que j'ai attendu vingt ans
Pour connaître ce climat
C'est l'hiver et ma case vit au rythme du vent
J'aurais juré qu'il n'y a pas si longtemps
Remplie à craquer tout l'été elle rassemblait
Au son de la musique et maintenant
Tout seul dans le brouillard des idées
J'écoute le son, les cils baissés sur mon crayon
Les premiers mots qui me viennent, c'est...

Sometimes Love can bring you down
But I'll be lovin' you so much...

Alors que lui,
Je le vois sortir ses mots
Son air ravi...
Il raconte les histoires
De ses amours perdus
Le temps d'un soir
Dans un Paris suspendu
Il déroute et dévie
Et moi je l'écoute et je l'envie
Je laisse mes cahiers sur le lit
J'irai écrire cette aprés-midi
Je laisse mes cahiers sur le lit
Tant pis...

J'suis pas vraiment jaloux
Il a la vie plus facile que moi
J'suis pas vraiment jaloux
Lui il a tout, et moi j'ai quoi ?",Je Suis Pas Vraiment Jaloux,2008
Ben Mazué,"14 ans, limite 15
Ce soir elle a de grands projets
14 ans mais très bientôt 15
Ce soir, elle abordera le grand sujet

Comme elle a une grande sœur, elle sait qu'avec l'âge viennent les excès
Et prendre de l'âge à 14 piges c'est
Comme un gage de qualité
Elle s'était coiffée 17 ans, sapée genre meuf qui 17 ans,
Maquillée je te, non,je te raconte pas comment

Pendant que de l'autre côté de la scène un type collégien
14 ans comme elle, vient de..partir la rejoindre
Quelques mois qu'ils se pratiquent, qu'ils se connaissent
Par milliers, ils s'en laissent des messages, trempés dans le sucre

Pratiquent ce numéro pour déverser l'amour
Quand des flots d'hormones inondées et
En un quart de tour
Brûle en comique
Parfois quand ils s'enflamment pour quelques heures 
Quand pour quelqu'un que tu connais pas,
Tu donnerais ta mère et ta sœur

L'amour adolescent, adossé dans les sens
Virevoltant, déhanchant des innocences et dans le sens
C'est toujours dans mes pensées, c'est tellement beau,puissant
Si tu le sais pas, elle te rappellera que Roméo avait 16 ans

Alors le voilà dévalant l'avenue du 11 novembre
La voilà l'attendant, docile et tendre
Elle aime qu'il l'aime, il aime grandir, 
Il aime qu'elle vienne de loin juste pour le voir sourire

Qu'elle dit à ces mains qui traînent
Presque au dessus des fesses
Il tremble comme une feuille à chaque caresse
C'est pas le stress,non, c'est pas l'excitation, c'est juste un test
Allez vas y mon garçon

Mais rien n'y fait, rien ne s'estompe
Un peu plus tard, pour réduire les effets
Il se cachera pour faire des pompes
On lui a tellement dit, faut pas forcer la main des filles, il faut les protéger
Qu'a l'heure de faire l'amour il réalise qu'en fait, c'est lui l'objet?

Alors toujours bouche contre bouche, 
Touche contre coucher et elle se débrouille 
Pour que ses yeux sur ses seins viennent loucher
Elle retire son soutien-gorge
Après qu'il est tout tenté
Tout entier dévoué à une seule cause

Il regrettera le temps des toges parce que là, c'est compliqué
De retirer à une seule main ce genre de chose
Les chaussettes aussi, c'est vrai, c'est le passage délicat,
Elle y arrive qu'avec les pieds
Mais lui, il arrive pas

C'est l'aventure et c'est laborieux
Mais c'est le temps et sa cambrure
Qu'ils tiennent dans leur petit jeu
Maintenant qu'on en est là, sous les draps, le reste n'est qu'animal
Elle sera courageuse, il fera tout pour qu'elle n'est pas mal

Il a les yeux plus ouvert que jamais, pourtant c'est le noir complet
Deux fois en dessous, trois fois au dessus
Elle pense a sa sœur qu'il l'a fait
Elle se dit qu'elle, ça y est

Elle constate qu'il ne tremble plus.",14 Ans,2014
Ben Mazué,"En soirée appart', y'a deux types de dragueuse
Celles des salons, les danseuses
Et celles des cuisines et des balcons, les parleuses
Elle, c'était une parleuse

Elle avait de la bouteille,
C'était très agréable d'ailleurs de parler avec elle
Le genre elle était jamais vraiment loin de toi
Pendant toute la soirée
C'est la coïncidence heureuse des filles
Qui provoquent l'occasion sans trop la provoquer
Abordent sans déborder
D'une façon prudente et silencieuse

Et tout s'accélère quand elle parle
C'est comme un appât qu'elle vous tendait avec ses cils
Elle vous a ferré et son arme réside dans sa manière de vous relancer
Sa cible, vous séduire
En commençant par vous faire rire
Quelques naïves confessions vous permettent de penser
Qu'elle n'est pas maladroite en talons compensés comme simple tenue
Et que vous seriez sûrement très bien tous nus
Et même si c'est déjà vendu,
Même si l'évidence est rendue,
On traîne souvent longtemps sur le palier de la séduction 
Avant de se hisser vers un enlacement salivaire
Quand on est une dragueuse de cuisine et de balcon, on préfère

Les danseuses, elles, sont plus franches du collier
On se séduit, d'accord, mais pour vite s'embrasser
Et là je sais qui y'aura rien
Jusqu'à ce qu'en trois minutes j'ai entre mes mains ses seins
Et au bout de ma langue, cht
Elle connaît tout le monde, elle a quelques rires, vagabonde
Le corps joliment dessiné, elle est bien habillée,
Elle a 35 ans, elle me l'a dit mais ça se voyait,
J'ai pas été surpris
35 ans ça fait 10 ans de plus que moi
10 ans de plus
Imagine, moi, si je draguais 10 ans de moins que moi?
N'importe quoi

J'ai pas de passion pour les filles plus vieilles en particulier,
Loin de moi l'idée de penser que c'est un défi ou une case à cocher
Mais elle n'a d'âge que l'expérience en plus, elle a pas changé de vie,
Pas de marmots en bas-âge, de maison dans le Vaucluse, et, surtout, pas de mari
Donc ça me fait une raison de plus de pas reculer alors vas-y continue de parler, continue
Je n'ai qu'une seule et même idée

La soirée se finit
Et la soirée continue, rejoins-moi tu m'as dit,
Et j'ai pas répondu
Mais je te garantis
Que c'est marché conclus",25 Ans,2014
Ben Mazué,"Allô? C'est lui-même, ouais. Oui, je veux bien, ouais, j'ai le temps
Oh, vous savez, moi, je suis à la retraite depuis vingt ans donc, euh
Euh oui, oui, je regarde la télé l'après midi
J'allais dire, c'est de mon âge, hein
Je regarde les séries pourries avec les pubs
Pour les fauteuils électriques qui permettent de monter à l'étage. Voilà
Trois heures par jour à peu près, je sais pas, je compte pas hein non plus
Il m'arrive de rester longtemps dehors, surtout l'été
Je profite mieux qu'à la fenêtre
À l'affût d'un événement qui me sorte d'un quotidien pas trop dégueu du reste
Moi, j'ai pas peur là, comme vous, les jeunes
De tomber, de me planter, de l'avenir et du reste
J'ai fait ce qu'il fallait quand il fallait
Et ce qu'il manquait, je l'ai digéré depuis des lustres, alors!
Sans ceinture de sécurité, sans casque!
Sans souci de la ""biodiversité""
On a su tenir. On avait d'autres problèmes
Et pas moins gros d'ailleurs mais j'ai le souvenir que quand même 'fin bon
Ce qui est sûr, c'est que là, entre vous et moi, le plus près de la fin
C'est pas le moins serein
Et vous avouerez que c'est bizarre
Ok, j'ai plus rien à prouver mais c'est pas la perte d'un emploi
qui m'attend au bout du couloir là
C'est la Mort, connard, et je te le dis franchement, je l'attends
J'en ai moins peur depuis quelque temps et, si jamais ""au delà"" il y a
y'aura plus de potes là-bas que dans mon appartement
Ça va, la vie, je l'aime bien quand même, hein!
J'irai pas me foutre en l'air volontairement
J'apprécie pas grand chose mais c'est devenu beaucoup parce que
Des pas grands choses, dans la vie, y'en a plus que des gros coups
Un café, un peu de soleil, sérieux, c'est juste ça
Je m’émerveille, sobrement, mais je m'émerveille
Voilà, j'ai gagné cette série T avec des épreuves, mon petit, t'as pas idée
Si je te les raconte, je te donne pas trois minutes pour décrocher!
Et raccrocher

Pourtant, je suis pas de l'époque des grandes guerres
Moi, c'est les Trente Glorieuses et le plein emploi!
Et je te garantie qu'on avait de quoi se faire de la bile
Alors écoute un peu le vieillard et lâche un peu la bride
Je suis pas de l'époque des grandes guerres, moi
C'est les Trente Glorieuses et puis le plein emploi
Mais je te garantie qu'on avait de quoi se faire de la bile
Alors écoute un peu le vieillard et lâche un peu la bride

L'occident décline, la croissance recule? C'est vrai
Mais, sans croissance, pas de perspectives
Sans perspectives, des jeunes comme vous, désœuvrés
Maintenant, peut-être qu'on a arrêté de croître parce qu'on est déjà très haut
Et il serait temps d'inventer, je sais pas moi, des trucs nouveaux!
Le monde de demain, tiens!
Parce qu'on va pas sans cesse compter sur le fait de grossir
C'est pas la peine
Il est mort dans l’œuf
Le rêve qu'on finisse tous par atteindre la classe moyenne américaine
Mais tant pis, vous, au lieu de dire ""venez, on invente""
Vous dites ""venez, on reproduit""!
J'ai rarement vu moins rebelle que votre génération d'abrutis
D'individus individualistes, vaguement divisés sur des sujets futiles et vains
Mais unis comme jamais dans la peur du lendemain
Ce qu'il vous faut? Je vais vous le dire ce qu'il vous faut
Pépère, ce qu'il vous faut
C'est une bonne guerre",73 Ans,2014
Ben Mazué,"Ça doit être la 700,000ème fois
Que je te voie t'habiller
Choisir cette culotte ou celle-là
Que je te vois t'abîmer

Parce qu’on se sent capable de tout encore mais
On a gagné quelques plis sur le corps

Mais si la vie par malchance me fait louper quelques rendez-vous
Pour cause de mollesse
Négligence de jeunesse

On devait pas aller au bout
Ça fait dix ans que t'es passée devant mes yeux, dix ans que j'me dit que
C'est c'qui m'est arrivé de mieux

On se l'est tellement dit que ce serait pour longtemps
Que finalement dix piges ça paraît pas tant
C'est pas si épatant, ça rafraîchit l'odyssée

Plus que l'on réussit, on essaie
On essaie

C'est c'qui m'est arrivé de mieux

Oh, mais si à l'avenir on passe à côté
Si on n'exige pas au moins aussi bien que c'qui vient de se passer
Moi j'ai encore nos débuts en mémoire, nos espoirs et je rougis pas de c'qu'on est devenu
Deux enfants plus tard

Dix ans de nous, dix ans de nous
Est-ce que je tresse pas trop tôt des lauriers?
Dix ans de nous, dix ans de nous
Est-ce que je tresse pas trop tôt des lauriers?
Dix ans de nous, dix ans de nous
À deux doigts d'oublier qu'on s'est déjà perdus
Dix ans de nous
J'attends pas de toi tout (dix ans de nous) 
Mais j'attends de nous ça
Mais j'attends de nous tout
Dix ans de douceurs, de souffrances, de coups d'peur
De tourments de lose et de tournants
Des souffleurs de crise et des bonheurs qui se brisent
Mais qu'on sait ranimer
Ce sera ça aimer
Pour nous c'est ça",10 ans de nous,2017

In pain and desperation
Her aching limbs and downcast face
Aglow with perspiration 

Stiff as wire, her lungs on fire
With just the briefest pause 
The flooding through her memory
The echoes of old applause

She limps across the floor
And closes her bedroom door
The writer stares with glassy eyes

Defies the empty page
His beard is white, his face is lined
And streaked with tears of rage

Thirty years ago, how the words would flow
With passion and precision
But now his mind is dark and dulled
By sickness and indecision
And he stares out the kitchen door
Where the sun will rise no more

To live their fantasies
But most of us just dream about
The things we'd like to be

Singing myself to sleep
Wrapped in all of the promises

I no longer cry to myself

Just diaries of blood stained pages

Burning their lies, Burning my dreams

I'll burn it all down 
As my anger reigns

Walking through life unknown
Knowing that no one cares
But who can love
What I won't let them touch, no
Nobody is getting in here

There's no sense reaching out
Now with hope or in doubt
For a cause or a remedy
I've done all I can 
I just don't understand
Why it's all got to come down to me

Ben Nichols,"Born under a south Kentucky sky
He’d come west to Mexico to fight 1842 at Mier 
The gutters filled with blood and fear
Barely made it back to Texas alive

With Missouri Volunteers when the war began 
In ’46 they crossed the Rio Grande
There he met his dark-eyed love

But said good bye when the war was done
He swore that he’d come back for her again

Oh oh novia
Oh oh your man is gone
Maybe he’s in Texas
But we’ll take what God has left us 
And we’ll leave for California with the dawn

Worked his way back to Old Mexico
To reclaim the love he’d left two years ago 
Back to those same city walls 
Where he’d watched copper cannonballs 
Like wayward suns roll down the cobblestones

They put him in a prison left alone
With other yankee fools so far from home
Parade them through the square in chains
‘Till in rode Captain Glanton’s gang
Apache scalps for bounties paid in gold

Glanton’s men were killers all by trade
And through the prison bars a deal was made 
Glanton needed three new men 
Hired the lovelorn veteran
The killers rode out through the governor’s gates

The Veteran left camp ‘fore the rising sun
No killer he’d left other work undone
He was not yet two days out
When Glanton’s naked native scouts
Brought back his empty horse and his brand new gun",Chambers,2009
Ben Nichols,"Hey Hey Davy Brown
You weren’t born a killer 
But ya can’t tell it now

Take that shotgun 
Saw it on down
You’re one bloody bastard Davy Brown

One step ahead of that hangman’s noose
Gonna take ‘em all with ya when they come for you

Hey Hey Davy Brown 
Keep yer eye on the coin 
And yer ear to the ground

Your Whitneyville Colt
Cut a buncha men down 
A string full of ears
For Davy Brown

One step ahead of that hangman’s noose
Gonna take ‘em all with ya when they come for you

Davy Brown, Davy Brown 
Where ya gonna be when the hammer comes down?
Can you outshoot the Devil? Outrun his hounds? 
Ain’t nothing to it but to stay above ground

Hey Hey Davy Brown 
Woke up in jail 
For the last time now

Set a boy a fire 
Shot another one down
It’s a dance with the gallows

Look away 
Look away 
Nothing to loose

left east tenneessee at fourteen 
Wonderd to the west

Look away 
Born into death 

you fought the salors in New Orleans
You worked the flat boats and walked the streets
Hit Nachdogdes in '49 
And there you saw the devil for the very first time

Kid don;t you know me 
We are the last of the true 
Drink up drink up

Signed on with a stone mad captian rode on mexico
Look away 
Look away 
War behold
Jailed with killers one and all but we were killers free 
Look away
Look away 
Look to me 

you saw the lancers 'mid heathen hordes 
Bloodstained viels 
And costumes of war 
Hell ain't that full boy hear me 
War is the game and the god we seek 

(chorus)

(bridge)

we set out as men of reason armed with navy colts 
Look away
Look away
Work paid in gold 

but you stood witness to yourself our trial you did betray
Look away
Look away
To judgement day

we killed in the dessert we killed in the streets 
We choose what shall and shall not be 
We stood with pistols fought back to back
Now you've stood your ground but what ground is that

Ben Nichols,"In my hands, I hold the ashes
In my veins, black pitch runs
In my chest, a fire catches
In my way, the setting sun
Dark clouds gather 'round me
Due northwest, the soul is bound
And I will go, on ahead free
There's a light yet to be found

The last pale light in the west
The last pale light in the west

And I ask for no redemption
In this cold and barren place
Still I see a faint reflection
And so by it, I got my way

But hell, it's almost over now
I don't see nothing but the light
Darkness filled my days
The rising sun has shown the way
And I don't see nothing but the light
A preacher's lesson, simply armageddon
The devil, he knows how to write
Killer of men, no way to save them
Hey now we all have to die

You wouldn't think that out here
A man could simply run clear
Out of country, but oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, nothing but the light

They took my ears in Omaha
I thought me dead but I weren't at all
And I left them bleeding in the mud
They ran in me for horse thievery
Between my eyes for all to see
And I left them bleeding in the mud

When this wall was made
It was never meant to save everyone in kind
I don't believe God much had me, had me much in mind

You wouldn't think that out here
A man could simply run clear
Out of country, but oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, there's nothing but the light

So tell the barkeep, ""What is there to drink?""
Just a minimal risk of blindness or death
It all taste of ashes, seems that's always what we get
It's all they have to give

Out of country, but oh my, oh my

The hoof prints cloven in the stone

Seem so far away

Won't bring back yesterday

Seen the phoenix rise
Say even from the pyre
The dawn can still be beautiful

The sound of your sunrise
Carries on the four winds
You shed yesterday's skin
And a new day begins

Seem so far away
Why go chasing rainbows

From a place long gone
Sometimes we want to throw away

O Star (the fairest one in sight),
Say something to us we can learn by heart.

{There's one somewhere in the sky}
{There's one somewhere in the sky}
{There's one somewhere in the sky}
{There's one somewhere in the sky}

To carry praise or blame too far,
We may choose something like a star

And be staid.

-- Original poem --

O Star (the fairest one in sight),
We grant your loftiness the right
To some obscurity of cloud --
It will not do to say of night,
Since dark is what brings out your light.
Some mystery becomes the proud.
But to be wholly taciturn
In your reserve is not allowed.

Say something to us we can learn
By heart and when alone repeat.
Say something! And it says ""I burn.""
But say with what degree of heat.
Talk Fahrenheit, talk Centigrade.
Use language we can comprehend.
Tell us what elements you blend.

It gives us strangely little aid,
But does tell something in the end.
And steadfast as Keats' Eremite,
Not even stooping from its sphere,
It asks a little of us here.
It asks of us a certain height,
So when at times the mob is swayed
To carry praise or blame too far,
We may choose something like a star
To stay our minds on and be staid.",Choose Something Like a Star,2004

Beware my foolish heart

Ben Platt,"Guys like you and me we're just the losers
Who keep waiting to be seen, right?
I mean no one seems to care or stops to notice that we're there

And make me more than an abandoned memory
That means we matter too
It means someone will see that you are there

No one should come and go
And have no one know he was ever even here
No one deserves to disappear

You still matter

And even if you're somebody who can't escape the feeling
That the world's passed you by
You still matter

If you never get around to doing some remarkable thing
That doesn't mean that you're not worth remembering
Think of the people who need to know

This picture-perfect afternoon we shared
Drive the winding country road
Grab a scoop at À La Mode
And then we're there

An open field that's framed with trees
We pick a spot and shoot the breeze
Like buddies do
Quoting songs by our favorite bands
Telling jokes no one understands
Except us two
And we talk and take in the view

All we see is sky for forever
We let the world pass by for forever
Feels like we could go on for forever this way
Two friends on a perfect day

We walk a while and talk about
The things we'll do when we get out of school
Bike the Appalachian trail or
Write a book or learn to sail
Wouldn't that be cool?

There's nothing that we can't discuss
Like girls we wish would notice us but never do
He looks around and says to me
""There's nowhere else I'd rather be""
And I say, ""me too""

And there he goes
Racing toward the tallest tree
From far across the yellow field I hear him calling, ""follow me"" there we go
Wondering how the world might look from up so high

One foot after the other
One branch then to another
I climb higher and higher
I climb 'til the entire
Sun shines on my face

And I suddenly feel the branch give way
I'm on the ground
My arm goes numb
I look around
And I see him come to get me
He's come to get me
And everything's okay

Well I hope you're proud of your big decision
Yeah, I hope it's all that you want and more
Now you're free from the agonizing life you were living before

Well I hope you had a blast while you dragged me along

And you say what you need to say
And you play who you need to play
And if somebody's in your way
Crush them and leave them behind

Well I guess if I'm not of use
Go ahead, you can cut me loose
Go ahead now, I won't mind

I'll shut my mouth and I'll let you go

Would that be good for you, you, you?

I'll just sit back while you run the show
Is that good for you?

Can't erase what I wrote in ink

Oh, why don't you take it?
Oh no, no, I couldn't​
Why not?
Are you sure?

I bought this glove a thousand years ago
For some birthday or some Christmas that has come and gone
I thought we might play catch or, I don't know
But he left it in the bag, with the tag still on

You'll have to break it in though, first 
You can't catch anything with it that stiff​

How do you break it in?

Well, it's all a process that is really quite precise
A sort of secret method known to very few
So, if you're in the market for professional advice
Well today could be a lucky day for you

Shaving cream

Shaving cream?

Oh yeah you rub that in for about five minutes, 
Tie it all up with rubber bands, put it under your mattress, and sleep on it
And you do that for at least a week, every day, consistent​

And though this method isn't easy
Every second that you spend is gonna pay off
It'll pay off in the end

It just takes a little patience
It takes a little time
A little perseverance
And a little uphill climb

You might not think it's worth it
You might begin to doubt
But you can't take any shortcuts
You gotta stick it out

And it's the hard way
But it's the right way
The right way to break in a glove

With something like this, you gotta be ready to put in the work, 
Make the commitment 
So what do you think?

I mean, definitely​

Some people say just use a microwave
Or try that run it through hot water technique
Well, they can gloat about the time they saved

Even when everyone around you thinks you're crazy
Even when everyone around you lets things go
And whether you're prepping for some test
Or you're miles from some goal
Or you're just trying to do what's best
For a kid who's lost control

You do the hard thing
'Cause that's the right thing
Yeah, that's the right thing

Uh, a dad who cared so much about

We start believing that we belong

Ben Pollack,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you

Correction Notes:

It's been a real long time since I seen you girl
It's been a real long time in another world
I got scars to prove that I don't need you but the heart knows that I always do
You and me, could never be
We're forever leaving, you and me
And I couldn't tell you what I needed
But it's hard to speak when you're barely breathing
Does it take a broken heart to find that your all I needed all this time
You and me, could never be
We're forever leaving, you and me
You and me
You and me
Been giving up on the feeling, been giving up on believing, been giving up on you and me, woah
If my hearts still beating in my eyes see it this is how we'll always be
Oh you and me yeah
You and me, could never be
We're forever leaving, you and me
You and me",You and Me,2011
Ben Rector,"Well I'll be your rainy day lover
Whenever the sunny days end
And whatever the weather, we have each other
And that's how the story will end

Well I'll be your shade tree in summer 
If you'll be my fire when it's cold
And whatever the season, well, we'll keep on breathing
'Cause we'll have each other to hold

And I'll hold you and I'll sing

Well, I wanna love you, forever I do
I wanna spend all of my days with you
Will carry your burdens and be the wind at your back
Well, I wanna spend my forever, forever like that

Well I'll be the words on the pages
If you'll be my sweet melody
And the tune can keep changing, 'cause I'll keep arranging
And this is the song that we'll sing

And I'll hold you and I'll sing

Well, I wanna love you, forever I do
I wanna spend all of my days with you
Carry your burden and be the wind at your back
Well, I wanna spend my forever

When the rain comes, I'll be your shelter, yeah
When the wind blows, lover, we'll be together
When the storms they rise, well I'll be right here by your side

And I'll sing

Well, I'm gonna love you, forever I do
Well, I'm gonna spend all my days with you
Will carry your burdens and be the wind at your back
Well, I'm gonna spend my forever, forever like that",Forever Like That,2013
Ben Rector,"There's no need to complicate it
Dress it up or overstate it
Without too much hesitation
Here's the way I feel

Well, I like you, I like you
Even when I don't try to
Yes I do, that's the truth
I like you

Seven years is a long, long while
Somehow you still make me smile
I'd say almost most the time
Here's the way I feel

I like you, I just like you
Even when I don't try to
Yes I do, that's the truth
I like you

There way too many love songs
And I think they've got it all wrong
'Cause life is not the mountain tops
It's the walking in between
And I like you walking next to me

Well I like you, I like you
Even when I don't try to
Yes I do, that's the truth
I like you, yeah, yeah

Even when I don't try to
I still like you",I Like You,2013
Ben Rector,"I don't wanna be no star
Have fame on the Boulevard
No that's not what I'm looking for

I don't need shiny things
Or love from a movie screen
But I tell you what I really want

Oh oh, oh oh gimme an ordinary love
That I touch
That I hold
Gimme an ordinary love

I don't live in the hills
And I probably never will
But that won't keep me up at night

Cause she's dancing like a fool
Across my living room
Whenever I'm with you
my heart is singing

Oh oh gimme an ordinary love
That I touch
That I hold
Gimme an ordinary love

Keep those fancy things
Keep your magazine
I don't even want what I'm chasing
because all I know isn't ordinary love is what we're made for

Oh oh, oh oh gimme an ordinary love
That I touch
That I hold
Gimme an ordinary love

Oh oh, oh oh gimme an ordinary love
That I touch
That I hold
Gimme an ordinary love

Gimme an ordinary love
Yeah gimme an ordinary love",Ordinary Love,2013
Ben Rector,"I feel just like a sailboat
I don't know where I'm headed
But you can't make the wind blow
From a sailboat
I have seen the sun
I felt the rain on my skin
I've been lost and found
But mostly I've been waiting

Oh I'm out in the waves
And I'm hoping and praying
Please let this wind blow me home
And night after night there's an empty horizon
My God do I feel so alone
But sometimes life, most times I, feel just like a sailboat (mmm)

And I'm pretty sure I'm heard
At least I know I'm speaking
But I feel like a fool (yeah)
'Cause I can't hear you listening (mmm)
But I'm not giving up (oh)
I'm gonna move on forward
I'm gonna raise my sail
God knows what I'm headed towards

Oh I'm out in the waves
And I'm hoping and praying
Please let this wind blow me home
And night after night there's an empty horizon
My God do I feel so alone
Sometimes life, most times I, feel just like a sailboat (mmm)

The only change I see
The lost are found at sea
The only difference
Is believing I'll make it in

Oh I'm out in the waves
And I'm hoping and praying
Please let this wind blow me home
And night after night there's an empty horizon
My God do I feel so alone

Oh I'm out in the waves
And I'm hoping and praying
Please let this wind blow me home
And night after night there's an empty horizon
My God do I feel so alone
Sometimes life, and most times I, feel just like a sailboat",Sailboat,2013
Ben Rector,"I go a little crazy sometimes
Can you believe it?
Yeah, I swear I'm fine, that I'm alright
When I'm barely breathing
Thought I could find my way back home
But I get lost alone

But when I'm with you I'm no longer wandering
And when I'm with you, I swear I can breathe
When I'm with you, I know who I am and who I wanna be

I'm not trying to be dramatic, no
Most times I'm pretty normal
Oh, but let's be clear and honest here
And do away with anything formal
I can fake it on my own
But I am lost alone

But when I'm with you I'm no longer wandering
And when I'm with you, I swear I can breathe
When I'm with you, I know who I am and who I wanna be
Who I wanna be

I am wide-eyed
With a penchant for running
But how many times does it take 
'Til I find that I'm lost when I'm alone
And that's not where I belong

'Cause when I'm with you I'm no longer wandering
When I'm with you I can finally breathe
When I'm with you, I swear to God
I swear to God I'm who I wanna be

Yeah-eh
I'm who I
I'm who I wanna be
Yeah-eh yeah-eh
I'm who I wanna be
Yeah-eh yeah-eh
I'm who I
I'm who I wanna be
Oh-oh yeah-eh
I'm who I wanna be",When I'm with You,2013
Ben Rector,"I never was much good at hoping
Until you took my heart and tore it open
Never understood what love was
Until I took your hand with the Lord above us

And then you caught flame like a wildfire
You came running into my life
And you light up the dark but I can't see
How you belong to a boy like me
How you belong to a boy like me

And I have learned that you're not perfect
And that sometimes the one you love can burn you
It's just the fools looking backwards
A bitter heart turns the love we made to ashes
A bitter heart turns the love we made to ashes

And then you caught flame like a wildfire
When I'm with you I'm so alive
And you light up the dark but I can't see
How you belong to a boy like me
How you belong to a boy like me

When you love someone they're gonna hurt you
When you love someone they're gonna burn you
But don't let that burn you down

'Cause you caught flame like a wildfire
When I'm with you I'm so alive
And you light up the dark but I can't see
How you belong to a boy like me
How you belong to a boy like me",Wildfire,2013
Ben Rector,"I feel like new sunglasses, like a brand new pair of jeans
I feel like taking chances, I feel a lot like seventeen

I feel like windows rolled down, new city, streets and cabs
I feel like anything can happen, laughing,
You take me right back, when we were kids
Never thought I'd feel like this

Like when I close my eyes and don't even care if anyone sees me dancing
Like I can fly, and don't even think of touching the ground
Like a heartbeat skip, like an open page
Like a one way trip on an aeroplane
It's the way that I feel when I'm with you, brand new
Brand new

I feel like a young John Cusack, like making big mistakes
I feel like for the first time in a long time I am not afraid
I feel like a kid, never thought it'd feel like this

Like when I close my eyes and don't even care if anyone sees me dancing
Like I can fly, and don't even think of touching the ground
Like a heartbeat skip, like an open page
Like a one way trip on an aeroplane
It's the way that I feel when I'm with you, brand new

Time will always try to make us fold
You remind me what I used to know

Like when I close my eyes and don't even care if anyone sees me dancing
Like I can fly, and don't even think of touching the ground
Like a heartbeat skip, like an open page
Like a one way trip on an aeroplane
It's the way that I feel when I'm with you, brand new

Brand new, yeah, yeah, yeah

To your apartment where I am waiting now

Maybe not Anaheim, keep an open mind
I'm just sayin', baby
Let's go

You and me tonight
Drive
Let's drive

When's the last time we dropped our things and went?
Woke up somewhere that we've both never been?
Growin' up doesn't mean gettin' older

Maybe it's just left turns off familiar streets
I just wanna come back with a memory
Growin' up doesn't mean gettin' older

I don't care

This pavement touches wherever we go, and
White lines flyin' by, who knows what we'll find

Ben Ricour,"Ah, si tout le monde était comme nous
Ce serait extraordinaire, c'est ce qu'il m'a dit
Encore hier, il parlait forcément de lui
Lui

Ça pour parler
Il parle tout le temps
Il a des avis déconcertants
Lui, et la guerre, il trouve ça normal

Ami d'enfance
Avec qui je n'ai plus de ressemblance
Ami d'enfance
Avec qui je n'ai plus d'indulgence

C'est son sourire
Qui est désarmant
Il te rend complice de ses arguments
Lui, et l'amour, il trouve ça banal

Ben Ricour,"Dans la vie y a l'amour aventure
Pourvu que ça dure
Pourvu qu'on ne soit d'accord pour ne pas abandonner
Si tout bascule à la malchance
Encaisse et avance
Y a pas une façon d's'y faire à la médiocrité

C'est mon éternelle méditation

Romance jusqu'où tu nous emmènes
Jamais jamais ne freine
Une fois qu'on est parti
Moi j'veux du beau et du grand et du souvent
Frappant même en sommeil
Aux portes du paradis

C'est ma prochaine destination

Ce n'est pas un jeu
Ce n'est pas un jeu
Tenter la vie
Pour ses beaux yeux

Dans la vie y a le mot aventure
Pourvu qu'on soit sûr
Pourvu qu'on soit d'accord pour ne pas abandonner
Ce n'est pas un jeu
Ce n'est pas un jeu
Chasser la vie
Comme un fou furieux

Chasser la vie

Ben Ricour,"Dans la plaine
Il est cinq heures à peine
On dit des gens d'ici
Qu'ils sont des indigènes
Si tu n'es pas d'ici
Ce n'est pas la peine
Que tu te la ramènes

Un jour j'en suis parti
L'histoire n'est pas finie
C'est une drôle de semaine
Qui me ramène ici
J'en mets ma main à couper
Qu'ils auront le souffle coupé
De me voir débarquer

J'ai mis les pieds dans la plaine
J'ai rallumé les haines
J'ai trouvé ça si beau
Quand elle m'a dit je t'aime

J'ai deux minutes à peine
Je la prends je l'emmène
Il nous faudra courir
Et se mettre hors d'haleine
Se mettre hors de la portée
Peu importe ne rien emporter
Loin d'ici s'exporter

J'ai mis les pieds dans la plaine
J'ai rallumé les haines
J'ai trouvé ça si beau
Quand elle m'a dit je t'aime

J'ai mis les pieds dans la plaine
J'ai rallumé les haines
J'ai trouvé ça si beau
Quand elle m'a dit je t'aime

Ben Ricour,"Comme tout ce qui est grand
Au début ça n'a l'air de rien
C'est qu'une formule, une vision
Un coup du destin
Que l'on abandonne
En route

Comme tout ce qui est vrai
Au début ça n'plait à personne
Une hérésie, une erreur
Un manque de calcium
Qui révolutionne
En douce

Je me réveille
C'est pas trop tôt
Je me réveille
J'suis pris d'assaut
Ca me réveille
Faire ce qu'il faut

Un seul souci
Sous un si grand ciel

Je me réveille

Laisser passer
Les idées nouvelles

Je me réveille

Quelle heure?
Quel siècle?

Je me réveille
C'est pas trop tôt
Je me réveille
J'suis pris d'assaut
Ca me réveille
Faire ce qu'il faut

Comme tout ce qui est grand
Au début ça n'a l'air de rien
C'est qu'une formule, une vision
Un coup du destin
Que l'on abandonne
En route

Comme tout c'qui est beau à la fin on n'en prend plus soin
La terre est belle
Et elle appelle à la rescousse
Qu'est-ce qu'on a tous
A n'y voir plus rien

C'est pas trop tôt
Je me réveille
C'est pas trop tôt",Je Me Reveille,2006

C'est précisément
Votre présence qui fait toute la différence

Tu me tiens par la manche

Tout te ressemble

Un peu comme les lézards font
Belle vue d'ici
Belle issue de la vie

De notre bon vieux soleil

Peut-être, je vais le regretter

J'sais pas où je vais, et j'suis sûr de rien

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Swaying to a fascinating strain

When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low

Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low

Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
