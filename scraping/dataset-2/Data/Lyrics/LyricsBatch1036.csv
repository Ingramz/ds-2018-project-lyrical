Split Enz,"My house is sliding into the sea 
Skies are grey, since you've been away 
The chickens aren't laying eggs no more 
It can only mean you left me for sure 

But I still think of you when I'm alone 
How can I ever repay you for what you do to me 
I still think of you when I'm alone 
How can I ever repay you for what you do to me 

La do dah la do dah dah la do dah 

My trees are all turning brown 
The sun won't shine, now you're no longer mine 
The rats are crawlin' up me back 
It can only mean you're never coming back 

But I still, think of you when I'm alone 
Oh how could I ever repay you for what you do to me 
And I still, think of you when I'm alone 
Oh how could I ever repay you for what you do to me 

La do dah la do dah dah la do dah 
Wooh! 

My bed is leaning to one side 
You know I can't sleep now that I've lost my pride 
The flies are swarming in like bees 
I even have to share my clothes with fleas 

But I still, yeah think of you when, I'm alone 
How can I ever repay you for what you do to me 
And I still, yeah think of you when, I'm alone 
How can I ever repay you for what you do to me 
Come on!",Lovey Dovey,1975
Split Enz,"Hiding in the wings forever
We'll take the stage, 'cause it's now or never
And the whole thing reeks of cheap striptease
The matinee idylls they all fall to their knees
It's not all first nights at all
here's nothing more dull than a curtain call
`Get on with it'
Playing Romeo, you make your debut, ha!
Rose red cheeks but your face is all blue

It's not all bouquets & white crayons
They're going to laugh when you look down
I'm going to ask you if you want to be a chorus boy
You can mime the tragedy while we all sing along
It's not all first nights at all
There's nothing more dull than a curtain call
`Jolly good show everyone'",Matinee Idyll (129),1975
Split Enz,"You act as though you were a blind man who's crying
Crying 'bout all the virgins that are dying
In your habitual dreams you know
Seems you need more sleep
But like a parrot in a flaming tree
I know, it's pretty hard to see

and I'm beginning to wonder if it's time for a change

but still you try like a fat boy dancing gershwin's blues
But you'd rather sit at home and watch the news

and I'm beginning to wonder if it's time for a change
I'm beginning to wonder if it's time for a change",Time for a Change,1975
Split Enz,"I found myself in silver dreams 
I'm talking in my sleep to pawns & queens 
Outspoken words, you know they just don't mean the same thing 

Somebody must be kiddin' me 
Somebody must be lying to me 
Oh please don't tell me 
Which is red and which is black 

When are you coming back to me babe 
Oh when are you coming back to me babe 

I saw myself in checkered lands 
I even dreamt I was the knight in command 
The bishop screamed 'Don't horse around boy' 

Somebody must be kiddin' me 
Somebody must be lying to me 
And please don't tell me 
I'm losing my way 

You promised me everything now, didn't you babe? 
You promised me everything now, didn't you babe?",Titus,1975
Split Enz,"Make a move, get off your spine 
Shake your leg, tow the line 
Mum's the word, the doctor said 
Try your hand at this instead 

Standing fast as bold as brass 
Holding on until the last 
Call the tune and play it all day long 
There's a song that's just begun 
Strikes a chord in everyone 
It's the decent thing to do your best 

Risk you take when on the make 
Is falling down upon the ground 
That's the breaks a bone or two 
Bring's it home it's up to you 

Standing fast as bold as brass 
Holding on until the last 
Call the tune and play it all day long 
There's a song that's just begun 
Strikes a chord in everyone 
It's the decent thing to do - your best 

They're gonna move my spine?

Split Enz,"History never repeats
I tell myself before I go to sleep
Don't say the words you might regret
I've lost before you know I can't forget

There was a girl I used to know
She dealt my love a savage blow
I was so young, too blind to see
But anyway that's History

(I say) History never repeats
I Tell myself before I go to sleep
Don't say the words you might regret
I've lost before you know I can't forget

You say I always played the fool
I can't go on if that's the rule
Better to jump than hesitate
I need a change and I can't wait

History never repeats
I tell myself before I go to sleep
And there's a light shining in the dark
Leading me on towards a change of heart (ah-ar)

History never repeats
History never repeats

Deep in the night it's all so clear
I lie awake with great ideas
Lurking about in no-man's land
I think at last I understand

History never repeats
I tell myself before I go to sleep
And there's a light shining in the dark
Leading me on towards a change of heart (ah-ar)
Never repeats
Never repeats
Never repeats

Split Enz,"Bad mouth crosswords, need a muzzle 
I'm down you're across 
I can't seem to solve this puzzle 
I turn while you toss 

Crosswords puzzle me it's frightening 
We're still friends but we're still fighting 

Cat and dog we trade black looks 
C'mon and do your worst 
The war of words demands surrender 
I won't be the first 

Crosswords puzzle me it's frightening 
We're still friends but we're still fighting 
Crosswords puzzle me it's frightening 
We're still friends but we're still fighting 

Get an earful, leave you tearful 
Careful who you cross 
We get close when we get angry 
Crosswords still the boss

We're still friends but we're still fighting 
Crosswords puzzle me it's frightening 
We're still friends but we're still fighting

Split Enz,"Roll up, roll up to the jamboree 
Roll up, roll up to the jamboree 

Roll up, roll up, troupers jamboree 
Old friends attend, long time no see 
Roll up, roll up, troupers come on down 
Big top, non stop, annual reunion 

I know what you're thinking, I know what you'll say 
But I gotta getta be, at the troupers jamboree 
There's safety in numbers, I'll never forget 
40 years ago, on with the show 

Distant voices calling, calling me 
Entertaining me 
Memories of the heydays 
With the better company

Old friends attend, long time no see 
Roll up, roll up, troupers come on down 
Big top, non stop, annual reunion 

Keeping a lonely vigil while the girls all have a ball 
The stories come out thick and fast, long, short and tall 
There's Frank do Preze on the flying trapeze 
Finally come down to earth 
Good ol' Chris the contortionist, is bent if not worse 
Dear ol' Merle the strip-tease girl, do anything for kicks 
And the ol' magician has disappeared, still up to his old tricks 
Well the gag man's been gagged 
And the straight man's gone straight 
The mime artiste too clever for words 
And the MC's still late

Oh Jamboree, oh Jamboree!
Oh Jamboree, oh Jamboree!

That was my mistake.
That was my mistake.
I went out to see if I could raise a laugh again.

To make me stop and think again,
Pull me up and pull me through.
Tally ho, your health my dear.

I went out to see if I could live for a couple of days.
That was my mistake.
That was my mistake.
One by one I counted all those happiest of days.

Don't let them get the best of me,

No more lost for love.

Split Enz,"I been licking my wounds 
Sick of holding my tongue 
I been sweating my way up those blue hills 
Now I'm taking the plunge 
I been stealing my nerves 
And I'm breaking a lot of wishbones 
Hope I'm displaying manly virtue 
Hope I haven't bitten off more than I can chew 

Oh wouldn't it be nice to know? 
Oh wouldn't it be nice to know?

Feel invincible behind that silver fern
And I'm full of a bittersweet anger 
Sick of meaningful dialogue

Hope I'm cooking my goose for the very last time

Split Enz,"Sitting on the veranda, with my old girl Miranda 
5 o'clock shadows soft in the gloom 
In love after a fashion, we're broke, spent all our passion 
9 o'clock and we're off to our room 

Coming like a habit, coming like a ritual 
The same old tête-à-tête in your dreamy feather-bed 
You give lessons in parrot fashion love 
The same old tête-à-tête in your dreamy feather-bed 
You give lessons in parrot fashion love 

Drunk and disabled we're both under the table 
With the crumbs, in the doldrums we play
Good loving and laughter, we both know what we're after 
And there don't seem a lot left to say 

Coming like a habit, coming like a ritual 
The same old tête-à-tête in your dreamy feather-bed 
You give lessons in parrot fashion love 
The same old tête-à-tête in your dreamy feather-bed 
You give lessons in parrot fashion love 

Polly want a cracker, Polly want a cracker 

The same old tête-à-tête in your dreamy feather-bed 
You give lessons in parrot fashion love 
The same old tête-à-tête in your dreamy feather-bed 
You give lessons in parrot fashion love, love, love, love. 

The same old monotone, you're gonna wind up on your own 
You learned your lesson, no more parrot fashion love 
Parrot fashion love
Love, love, love

Split Enz,"Well there's love on the menu 
Well there's love on the menu

Well there's love on the menu 
You don't know what you're missing 
Honey, honey make a meal out of me 
Take a big bite, or a nibble 
Oyster entrée, bon appetit 
Won't you never stop your complaining? 
Never stop, have a good vintage wine 
Every time we go eating out, 
Just desserts, tea and sympathy 

And the music plays on and on 
The chef gets the bacon for the filet mignon 
There's always the waiter, he knows how to cater

Sugar and spice, give me that savoured love 
Cheap at the price, give me that flavoured love 
Sugar and spice, it tastes so very nice 
Love's on the menu, me 'n' you 

Well there's love on the menu 
But you still refuse to listen 
2, 4, 6, 8 bog in, don't wait 
Take a big sip or a small nip 
Cappuccino or Burgundy 
Won't you never stop your complaining? 
Never stop, have a good vintage wine 
Every time we go eating out, 
Just desserts, tea and sympathy 

I'll be the knife if you'll be the fork 
I'll try the rump steak if you'll try the pork

Split Enz,"Live for the day,
When I'm left here on my own,
With no one to betray,
It's no wonder I prefer be a castaway
Who finds a friendly shore.

When you have a friend,
Then you have yourself a foe.
My right to defend,
Yours to scatter in one blow,
My defences,
I'm defenceless.

Here in the dark,
I guess a few fuses have blown.
The bites back in the bark,
And the gardens overgrown.
I'm in a right mess,
There's a tightness in my heart.

Like a fly in the ointment,
Love makes my flesh creep.
Love gets me hot and bothered,
It's just a reward I can't reap.
Lying alone on the lawn babe,
Hot sun overhead,
Waiting for a breath of inspiration
To carry me away instead.

Without a doubt,
Without a doubt.

Working
For precious little,
Playing,
The second fiddle.

I've been living on broken promises,
Living on guarantees,
Sometimes at night when the moon is bright,
You can see me down on my knees,
I'm looking for home truths,
An offer I can't refuse
A leap in the dark,
A touch and go,
I've got nothing left to lose?

Without a doubt,
Without a doubt.

I'm learning,
Back where I started,
I'm learning,
I'm broken hearted,

But without a doubt,
Without a doubt.

I'm working
For precious little,
I'm playing,
The second fiddle

Without a doubt,
Without a doubt.

I'm learning,
Back where I started
I'm learning,
I'm broken hearted,

But without a doubt,
Without a doubt.

Live for the day
When I'm left here on my own
With no one to betray
Its no wonder prefer to be a castaway
Who finds a friendly shore

Washed up on rocks,
In the calm after the storm,
I can run a amok,
And every days a high-day,
A holiday, my hideaway,
I've got no reason left to stay.",Without a Doubt,1977
Split Enz,"Betty was a working girl
living in the bottom half of the world
Saving up for Friday night
dancing underneath the lights, she would whirl

Dance, come on Betty sing, come on Betty, fly by night

Every man she meets appears to like her, then they whisper
'You coming outside?'
Leaning up against the fence
breathing hard and trying hard not to cry

Love, come on Betty give, come on Betty live for love

Who loves you Betty, always something standing in your way
You better get out Betty babe
Who loves you Betty, always someone looking the other way
You better get out Betty babe

There's always someone left behind, the crippled boy
the last in line, the lost soul
Love today is bought and sold
Betty wants the love of days gone old

Prim, proper little miss, gimme a little kiss, don't fuss

When my baby is walking down the street
I see red, I see red, I see red
How can someone wicked walk around free
I see red, I see red, I see red

You gave me such precious hours
What to do without you
Squeezed me out of your life
Down the drain like molten toothpaste
I feel used and spat out
Poor old me

And I wonder if we'll remember when we were 
Two little boys 

Long years past, war came so fast 
Bravely they marched away 
Cannon roared loud and in the mad crowd 
Wounded and dieing lie, up goes a shout 
A horse dashes out, out from the ranks so blue 
Gallops away to where Joe lay, then came a voice he know 

Did you think I would leave you dieing 
When there's room on my horse for two 
Climb up here, Joe we'll soon be flying 
I can go just as fast with two 
Did you say Joe I'm all a tremble, perhaps it's the battles noise 
But I think it's that I remember when we were two little boys 

Do you think I would leave you dieing 
There's room on my horse for two 
Climb up here, Joe we'll soon be flying

III. Mommy Comes Back
A baby was born in a small town yesterday
He's a magical child with a cosmic death ray
But his mother always wanted to play
Such a long way down

But mommy comes back
She always comes back to get me
Mommy comes back, she always comes back
And she never will forget me now

The baby grows up
And soon becomes a kid
Spends his whole life explaining
The things that his mother did
Then they say she went
And drowned
Such a long way down

CHORUS

When she came up
She'd looked better
»Look, dear, I made you a sweater«

Now it's all done
They live up in Monticello
With some pizza pockets
Some papers and a case of mello-yellow
But don't go in celloe - such a long way
Run when you hear the cello
You're in for a long stay
Hey, hey

IV. Lay It Down
Children yet to be born
Don't you mourn me now
'Cause the crows are in the corn
Lay it down, lay it down

Old man's on his porch
His house burning down
When he passes you his torch
Lay it down, lay it down

And the young man comes
To beat his drums
And the old man sings
'Here it comes, here it comes'
And Newsweek's featured
everyone by now
Lay it down, lay it down now
Lay it down

We built this house of cards
We can tear it down
When it hurts don't take it hard
Lay it down, lay it down

And the wildman brings
His wild man things
While the press keeps
Pressing on the pressure king
And the drums are beating
Everywhere by now
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down

V. The Healing Colors Of Sound, Part 2
One man said in sign
Don't you want to feel o.k.?
And the sighted man said to the blind
Don't you look at me that way again
Don't you look at me that way again

So they shared a glass of wine
And they started to feel o.k. again
Then one said one more time
said »Don't you see there now way to win -
Don't you see there's no way you can win«

But you can turn around to the healing colors of sound
Just turn around to the healing colors of sound

Old man's ship won't sail
Don't you think they've failed by now?
You can't just turn your tail
No, you can't go home that way again
No, you can't go home that way again

Where the sky is holding me)

Spoke,"Daddy look at me Iâ??ve found a gun.
I point it at my friends and I watch them run.
Iâ??m finding a solace in their fear.
I see them growing faint as I feed from their tears.
Send angels down from up above.
You know when I will rise you know when I will fall.
My faith is growing help me when I fall.
Help me rise above all of this impurity.
Help me rise above all of this insanity.
You might as well bury me alive
along with the dagger you stick in my side.
Youâ??ve lied to me right from the start.
Never caring a thing about breaking my heart.
Yesterday you tell me one thing
and today your telling me another.
Tell me the truth, for I thought you were my brother...

Keep me tied down in isolation,
Minds overcome by fascination,
Pushing ahead for separation

What makes you want to keep running
What makes you want to hide,
There's nowhere else to run nowhere else to hide

And wise with holes in his hands,

You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, ""Go slow"", I fall behind

And You will be there for the last
Mountains bow before You and the ocean turns to rain
The ocean turns to rain

You are a voice from the heavens I hear in the night
And You are the answer to questions I have in this life

Mile after mile they came to hear the words from You
The chance to touch You would change their lives
The ground would shake around You
When the earth would hear Your voice, the earth will hear Your voice

You are a voice from the heavens I hear in the night
And You are the answer to questions I have in this life

The ground would shake

We'll run to You and see

Setzt dich dann hin wie 'ne Nutte im Interview

Ich hab dir das Nazi-Boy-Image verpasst
Doch hätt' ich dazu keine Stellung genommen
Dann würdest du heut' noch von Ausländern
In deinem Block auf die Fresse bekommen
Ihr meintet, 4tune, dieser Bastard wird King?
Dabei kann er nicht mal gegen einen Laskah gewinn'
Du hattest keine Chance
Ich hab dich wacken Hurensohn zerbombt
Und ohne meine Hater hätt'st du nie den Uservote gewonn'
Kommt ran, doch vor dem King müsst ihr mit Vorsicht sprechen
Denn ich ermorde Rapper, scheiß auf ""sportlich Battlen""
Ich würde jeden, der sich traut, auf dem Planeten bekämpfen
Ich werd' nicht battlen, ich werd' eure Karrieren beenden

Spontaneous,"""(spoken)Yo, so you know, all of a sudden, we're in front of the 
restaurant and she decides she wants to leave on her own.  
And I'm  like ""Just go!"" you know?  And then she, 
she gotta get something out the car 
she gotta do this she gotta do that...(/spoken)

Yo she was always trying to fight me
Kick me and bite me
I used to argue with her daily and nightly
Trying to excite me, saying shit to spite me
She said ""I know it isn't another girl!"" I said ""It might be.""
There really wasn't but I said it cause she hyped me.
I know she loved me but she act like she don't like me
And started gradually just trippin' on me slightly
All of a sudden, she stopped acting politely
I said ""Just kiss me instead of trying to dis me.
'Cause when I'm gone you'll be hollering you miss me.
You should just love me instead of trying to shove me.
Try to hug me instead of trying to bug me.""
She beautiful but be acting like she ugly
I know she dug me but why the hell she drug me
Through all the drama talking 'bout that she can kill me?
Be flashing on me, turn around and say ""You feel me?""
I'm like ""Yo, you ain't always got to grill me
You better tighten up before somebody steal me.""

CHORUS:

Why you be acting up, why you be showing out?
Why you be talking all loud when we in the house?
What's with the attitude? Why you like to run your mouth?
I guess you really don't know what it's all about.
You gots to BOUNCE
Get your clothes and BOUNCE
Pack your bullshit and BOUNCE
Get your clothes and BOUNCE
Gimme everything and BOUNCE

She was always trying to hold me
Shape me and mold me.
I never knew and nobody ever told me
Trying to control me just because she know me
She said ""If you love me like you tell me then you show me!""
I had to tell her that I dealt with her solely
It didn't matter 'cause she treated me so coldly
Tried to talk with her but she blocked it like a goalie
We was lovers before we was homies
I said support me instead of trying to short me
Outvote me or root beer float me
Misquote me or even scapegoat me
And after all that insult me?

CHORUS

(spoken)You know, we used to be close now you want to badmouth me 
and talk to your friends all crazy about what I do...(/spoken)

She was always trying to clown me
Sink me or drown me
Outthink outdrink and out-of-bound me.
I used to leave but I hated when she found me
But she got to everyone in the townie
I tried to duck from the drama that surround me
It's in my blood, I'm a king you got to crown me
The way she flipped the script on me was astounding
""Who do you think about when you say who found me?""
I should have taught her everytime I fought her
I never caught her and never tried to salt her
I wonder why our relationship falter
I guess we both have the kind of life you can't alter.
People should make up instead of trying to break up
Or just break up cause that can be a wake up
And when you wake up make sure you take up
A little time so you don't make a mistake up.

CHORUS

Take your (keys/cat/dog/silverware/dishes/old couch) and BOUNCE

(spoken)Yo, alright, this is done. No more, I can't argue with you...""",Bounce,2003

Spook Handy,"While digesting Reader's Digest in the back of a dirty book store
A plastic flag, with gum on the back fell out on the floor
Well, I picked it up and I ran outside, slapped it on my window shield
And if I could see old Betsy Ross I'd tell her how good I feel

But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
They're already overcrowded from your dirty little war
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore

Well, I went to the bank this morning and the cashier he said to me
""If you join the Christmas club we'll give you ten of them flags for free""
Well, I didn't mess around a bit, I took him up on what he said
And I stuck them stickers all over my car and one on my wife's forehead

But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
They're already overcrowded from your dirty little war
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore

Well, I got my window shield so filled with flags I couldn't see
So, I ran the car upside a curb and right into a tree
By the time they got a doctor down I was already dead
And I'll never understand why the man standing in the pearly gates said

""But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
We're already overcrowded from your dirty little war""
""Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for

Spooks,"You won't believe the things I've seen
Far beyond your wildest dreams
I've seen chaos and order reign supreme
I've seen the beauty of the universe so peaceful and serene
In seconds turn to violence and screams

I've seen true genius
Too often elude the meaningless
Appreciation of this mediocre nation
I've heard the mindless repetition
Of empty words without tradition
Turn original verbs into submission
I smelled this malignerance addiction
But I guess I wouldn't be right
If I said the blunt was like a baby pipe
There ain't gonna be no revolution tonight
Half my warriors as high as a kite
Lost and they lost all they fight
And I've tasted, the bitter tragedy of lives wasted
And men who glimpsed the darkness inside, but never faced it
And it's a shame that most of y'all are followin' sheep
Wallowin' deeper than the darkness, you're fallin' asleep

You won't believe the things I've seen
Far beyond your wildest dreams
I've seen chaos and order reign supreme
I've seen the beauty of the universe so peaceful and serene

I've seen and experienced things
That'll push the average to the edge and swan dive to death
I'm two guys, multiplied by ninety-three guys
Evenly balanced seein' evil equally in each eye now
Maybe I'm the most thorough worker on the job to you
Or maybe I'm the one, who was plottin' to rob you
The fear of this beatdown, no women or no cash to floss
Makes most of y'all hustle ya ass off
From nothin to two mill', in five years I'll live to see it
Vanish in six months, with no tears believe it, I'll rock
Twenty-eight years before the Feds can lay a trace
See they plan is to erase me, just to replace me

Hmm like, your heart is warring with your brain
Emotional or reason, now which one do you obey?
Hmm like, somebody callin' you insane
When overwhelmed and blessed
Bursting tears of happiness

Yo, yo, I've seen relationships that's so sick
Life long friendships so cha-o-tic
Thug cat bangin his chick but won't kiss
Drinkin her spit, when coppin a fix for dope bliss
I got a knife and a bat, to bust your brain
Put the knife in your back once in the life, I was trifling like that
Like my man Troy, who lost his days
Shootin' dice on worldly ways and ended up in a early grave
Because once in a lifetime is rough
Twice in a lifetime you combat the ghosts of mistrust
Mentally cuffed, thrust by a cop thinkin he tough
You bust, Amadou Diallo is us, and what
Now I'm on my knees, beggin GOD PLEASE
Save me from the fires of hell
Let water water soul prevail, 'cause I can't take no more
Who's that knockin', at, my door?
Is that you, Pete from Cobb's Creek, who died in his sleep?
We was playin' for fun, now it's keeps
Like my man Mark I beat to death wrapped in a carpet
And left in the garbage, damn now that's cold-hearted

On the seam of my mind
Waits my destiny

The dark eye stead to me
They had a deep clean
Reflecting fantasy
Then out of nowhere
There came a voice to me
It said this nightmare
Will be reality

And now I'm still lost

With a shotgun in his arms

Before you leave my farm

Which replaced Joseph's hand

Try a little bit harder
Do for me as he would do for you

So treat me as your own

Well slowly Joseph well he lowered the rifle
And he emptied out the shells

He shook his arm and wished him well

He said now hey blind man that is fine
But I sure can't waste my time
So move aside and let me go my way
I've got a train to ride

Well Joseph turned around
His grin was now a frown
He said let me just refresh your mind

On an East Virginia farm
For charity's an argument

And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:

That though among the wastes of time must go,
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,
And die as fast as they see others grow,
And nothing 'gainst time's scythe can make defense,
Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.

Spoonie Gee,"[ VERSE 1 ]
Now you called my house and you said ""come over""
Your mother and your father are gone, and you're alone with Rover
Your dog, but now you're frontin
You said if I come you'd give me somethin
So don't start playin around, cause I'm serious
Girl, what did you call me for, cause I'm curious
Now did you call me just to look in my face
Now I know I ain't come just to take up space
Because the night is right, and the stars are bright
So come on, soul sister, why don't you do right
And just take if off, I mean everything
Hurry up, pretty mama, so that we can swing
Now I don't smoke, and I don't get high
But if I say I don't love, well, that would be a lie
Cause I do every chance I get
But if I don't, I won't fall, I won't fret
Cause I'm no fool, I got plenty of sense
So I'll just be cool and have patience
So when you make up your mind, please let me know
Cause when you give me the green, that's when i'll go
So please, pretty mama, don't hesitate
And entice me nice and cooperate
Now you tried the rest, now try the best
But when time come, girls, don't you fess
And just take it off, and I mean it all
Cause I'm big time, baby, and I ain't small
Now undo your hair, untie your shoe lace
And after you finished, I want you to face
Me, now baby, don't get scared
Cause I'm not like the other guys, so don't compare
Me, tender loving care's all I give
And if possible, girl, well, I would like to live
With you, but if I do it ain't everybody's business
Secretly is just how we got into this
So take it off, cause I'm ready to rock
And like ??? baby, until the last drop
Cruisin down the street in my SL
When I peeped this girl who was built very well
Her face was beautiful, body was fine
Well, how did I know? Cause I was cruisin behind
Her, looked at my car, looked at me
Then she asked me my name, I told the girl Spoonie Gee
But I didn't want to out-play my hand
So I talked so that she could understand
Me, she was definitely the move
I only said sweet things that would soothe
Her, opened up the door, and she got in
And automatically my mind just turned to sin
I told her: ""Take it off!""

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now I met this girl at Amusement Park
She was good to go and it was after dark
But you can guess, fellas, what was on my mind
Let's go under the boardwalk and have a good time
Baby, instead the girl asked me my sign
And I said, ""Why?"" and she said, ""Never mind""
Cause when the time comin it's you I'm thinkin of
A sign will make a difference on how you make love
To me you make me feel so good as a man
Ooh baby, you're sweet as cotton can-
-dy, if I could predict the rest of my life
I'd be a millionaire and you'd be my wife
So let's take a ride through the tunnel of love
Because you know what I'm thinkin of
Come on, baby, just take it off

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now I met this girl on the French Riviera
She said, ""Spoonie Gee, I'm gonna go wherever
You go, when you're on tour or when you're chillin
Cause if you're able, Spoonie Gee, I'm willin""
I said, ""Pretty mama, that's okay with me
So pass a glass and we'll sip Chablis
And in a half hour you'll be emblissed
When I give you a big french kiss
And then you want to take it off""",Take It Off,1996
Spoonie Gee,"I'm the godfather... of rap

Well let's get this straight, there's no contest
So now you people know don't have to guess
I'm not tha king of rap, not lord, not prince
I was a young kid rapper that I've been rapping ever since
I was just a young bub, I didn't care what mc's did
Before ??? cause I'm the godfather

I caught silly young ladies, two just chilled
They never said no to me - always say that they will do
Whenever I want them to - when I confront them to
Watch where ya're walkin', or just might browl to
I never rule them, I only school them
But if they ever try to fool me
That's when I foo them
I'm tha godfather

Long time to be chillin', just to make money
I rapped on stage, check my voice for your honey
Cause I'm rappin', and I'm not stoppin'
MC baby, who love stand hip-hopin'
so don't tease me, just kiss me
If ya already had a pimp, ya gonna miss me
I'm just a brother so what's upsaid
Cause it's a pretty ladies, I mean top like this
Ya know I'm the godfather

They say that I'm an mc some say that I'm a proud
I changed my style people just didn't know it yet
I had to tell them I might kill them 
you mess with me I'm sick your ass then swell them
Woah like on the phone, I'm 'bout to take charge
At the station for the new car in my garage
They want to cruise me, they don't move me
See my bankroll they want to try to use me
But I'm no fool never losin' my cool
But for me to darkness I make the young ladies drool
I'm not braggin' tellin' you what I'm about
Young ladies no babies and marriage bout
But if you insist you can't convince your house are mine
Night or day we'll be fine
So let's get with it, so that I can't hit it
After an hour or two me and you can just quit it

I'm the godfather

There's no need to be smokin' when the fire is out
So take your hand off your hip and let's work out
No leanin' on the wall no standin' around
So are you ready (for what ?!) for the beat in me now
Because people can't see me so people want to be me
Pretty young ladies want L Blue Spoon
The beat so fair so ate 9 o'clock in the morning
If they're playin' they'll call the cops cause I'm the godfather

I'm the godfather

You got rockin' beat no stoppin' beat
Some roars have things pumpin' beat
All the rest of my time Jerry knows my side
I'm so dip that's why I keep all girls in your mind
I'm not dedicate this at the top of this
Say cool you bring, don't break the rules if you want to get this
Respect me brother rapper recorded on the show
Ya could stare, cause I don't care it's just long you know

I'm the godfather

Now you be jumpin' your heart will be thumpin
Intendin' rappin', swearin' hip hopin'
Off your face, all know the place
Easely scatty standin' in pace
Don't stand around, your face road in my clan
This is the season no prisonner can't get down
So get all the world, let's up these words
Boogie down to the beat just give it to y'all
No need to get hot money dispenser
You can't have a good time cause it's so danger

An dem wir eben noch fiebernd saßen,
Mit jedem Schritt holt sich der Alltag selbst zurück,
Nach und nach verstummt auch die Musik

Zuhause wird es mir dann augenblicklich klar,
Dass es das mal wieder für ein paar Tage war,
Mir schmerzt die Seele und die mit nüchterndem Blick,
Kehrt die Einsamkeit zu mir zurück

Auf Wiedersehen, auf Wiedersehen,
Mit Schweiss, Blut und Freudentränen,
Werden wir den Kampf annehmen,
In all den Schlachten, die wir schlagen, 
An guten und an schlechten Tagen,

All I have to do to penatrate, is spin shorty to the mall, 
And show her how quick four g's dissyntergrate,

Spin them through all the stores with sexy clothes in it,
When she see something, she dying to pose in it, 
All she getting is a pre-shrunked tee with holes in it,
And when its time to eat, I arch the bucks,
A cheap nigga, yeah bitch, get a Arch Deluxe,

They think we should date, but still won't appriciate,
Neither help with the rate, or you order a decent plate,

To get her open, send her home with a token,
Put girls in my car, like dropping off for ass fucking,
So what you giving up, ass honey or gas money, pass dummies,
how's it gonna be if I don't eat,

Here comes the...here comes the Feds 
Watch out before they knock you and your crew 
So don't be a fool stash your jewels 

(Marlon Brando) 
Hey yo I tried to do it 
But Feds jumped out the Buick and blew it 
Hopped the fence with my gun drew it bustin through it 
I had anutha one if they catch me it's a beat down 
I'll run a couple of streets down before I put this heat down 
Yo, they had the vest, I had the Tef', 
Broke my right arm runnin, Mag in the left 
Run out of breath, just like Clark Kent jumped in the payphone, 
""Hello, my shit broke 'cause-o, yo Dubez stay home! 
And call King ?Cape Frome? to meet me on Burke, 
And stay alert, 'cause I heard Narc's is creepin' on Kirk 
But you high too, we'll be in why-O so drive-through 
Make sure you knock two, if the doorbell, it's not you 
Yea aight? But still think about keepin the flight, 
That Kirk booked, if you agree then we leave tonight"" 
""Aight aight,"" it's on hung up, lit one and puffed up 
Just waitin for Kirk hurt thinkin how I fucked up 

Chorus(2x): 
Yo here comes the Feds, the gig is up 
I guess we fucked up, made our biz corrupt 
Just maintain, cats are playin' in Pennsylvain' 
Or Maine, on the low an alias, no names 

(Big Dubez) 
Yo Marlon, what you mean meet on Burke? you off the hook 
If they out for a crook that's where they gonna look 
Don't get pepped, your best bet, dog, is clear the set 
My down low Lynette got the keys to the 'Vette 
Tell her ""the Milk Turtle"", honey know the code, you got heat 
And a gang of cash under the seat 
Man, fuck! I knew this deal was too sweet 
Now we in a heap, of shit that's too deep 
It was hard to sniff him out, he played it with the dreads 
I fucked up and just negotiated with the Feds 
Only if I put a tail on him, he'll be stuffed in a trunk sick 
Waiting for slugs to wail on him 
Just make it to the airport dog it's gonna work, 
Gettin out of state on time, it's on Kirk 
I'ma call him, fill him in on how we gotta fly now 
I just hope my nigga ain't in cuffs by now 

Chorus (2x) 

(King Kirk) 
Damn! I thought that cat I sold to was from the old school 
Old dude with the gold tooth I used to know dude 
Used to push a gold coupe and scoop, mad ice cream 
Nine-teen he had the white Beam' with the green ??pipe-beam?? 
Had clean hygiene, he stayed with a fresh scent 
Breath never stink, so chicks called him Peppermint 
Let me think, oh yea, he got knocked with a key 
This cat and his family told me he'd be home at three 
Bring 4 ki' bags, then sounded official 
When I served him I was tipsy, plus needed the chips, G! 
I fucked up, he tricked me, probably comin' to get me 
To hit me with three and Marlon it be a conspiracy 
Shit! gotta bounce and get out this fuckin house 
Call you from down south, I'm out, ""No doubt"" 
Grabbed the keys and the ki's, please gotta breeze 
Some G's of cheese, about to leave then ""FREEZE!!!"" 
Damn! 

(Don't you fuckin move, put your hands on your head, get on the floor! 
Gimme a reason to put a hole in you, gimme a reason! 
That's all I need son!) 

Chorus 

Here comes the...here comes the Feds 
Watch out before they knock you and your crew 
So don't be a fool stash your jewels 


",Fedz,1998
Sporty Thievz,"I want him dead. 
I don't care how you do it I don't care when you do it 
But I just want him dead. 
I don't care if you gotta bring him over here with his mother 
But I want him dead. 
I want his mother dead I want his father dead... 
I don't care I want his DOG dead... 

(Verse 1) 
Sonny pat me down sat me down said look at me now 
'Kirk no fucking around I want you to clap this clown 
If you fuck up then you fucked, best not to fuck 
Fuck you fucked then what? FUCK! You think you tough?' 
Chill! I need two's to bust, save the anger 
And all that hostility, stop grilling me, you killing me, feelin' me? 
Guess not...who you want dead? ""Vinnie."" How much bread? 
Shook his head fed and called his man Fred ""Yo Fred!"" 
Fred said, ""FUCK you!"" Oh fuck me? Lucky 
As long as none of you touch me everything'll be lovely 
Trust me, where the money at? Sonny tapped Fred, ""This is a funny cat 
You're black, you get the money when you come back!"" 
What's that? Whatchu say? Nah you didn't say that 
Laid back snatched the gat under my grey hat and said ""stay back"" 
Clack, I don't play that! Shot Fred in his top lip [Ahh!!] 
That's for popping shit, and shot Sonny is his dick [Ahhhh!!] 
Blew they brains then skipped in a Towncar brown car 
Vinnie said, ""What? No scars? How'd it go down, par'?"" 
""Like quicksand."" ""Damn, here's your thirty-six grand. 
Lemme shake your hand, shit man, you're my favorite hit man!"" 

(Chorus) 
Yo we hitmen, charge thirty G's ahead 
You might see the ex-poor theivz and want to fled 
Instead, blend in with the crowd while we cockin' this 
But sudden moves will just make yourself obvious 
Gimmie a price that I like, sound good then I might 
Take the life of whoever knowing never could do it better 
Remember no kids and double for females 
Pass the bills, pictures, and details and I'll do the kill 

(Verse 2) 
Peep the sag, I was fronted two G's by the mob 
Two Z's and the Saab for this hitman job 
Burnt my hand for initiation, cats told me the situation 
Them niggas transporter was lacing 
Coke was missing they was shortin' it up 
He was supposed to be importin' it up, but he was snortin' it up 
So they sent me to his house in a '98 Blazer 
Under my toungue, razor, gun pager with the lazer 
Jumped out with all black on feeling no love 
With the untouched slugs, black mask with the gloves 
Ran up in his crib-o with the click-o and seen dick-o 
Headed for the door with two tickets to 'Fransisco 
Him and his bitch, yo! She was looking type rio 
Flower shirt with the straw hat holding parico 
Yo chico! Where's the rest of the kilos, we know you got 'em 
Red light dot him, spot him on his head, shot him 
His girl behind him sobbing reaching for her stocking 
A holster strapped to her leg which she had the glock in 
She heard me cocking, and still tried to go for hers 
[gunshot] Kirk was like, ""Damn why you open hers 
Before she showed you where the Coca was? Fuck man..."" 

(Chorus) 

(Verse 3) 
Dog it ain't much time for explaining, and you a hitman in training 
What to and not to do when the bullets start raining 
Killing and maintaining be the key for this academy 
Number one: never ever ever point a gat at me 
FUCK if it's unloaded, threaten this man's health 
Bust me by mistake I'll kill you my DAMN self 
Now hold it to the side firm, squeeze 'till they squirm 
Use nines for long niggas tec-nines for strong niggas 
Never let a contract disrespect your flow 
'cause you might be next to get it when collecting your dough 
But yo, the best target is one that barely moves 
German 2's that'll be kept tucked under daily news 
Every shot counts with the nigga hired to hit on 
You don't want an empty clip with more niggas to shit on 
No vest and you get lit on, then you might wanna split man 
But shit, man, that's all part of being a hitman 

(Conversation with amateur hitman) 

(Chorus) 

There's three no's to a hitman: 
No kids 
No mistakes 
No witnesses

An angel, a guardian sent to overlook [echoes]

(Verse 1)
Ay yo for you crooked cops, the thug life lookin nox
Wife cooking rocks, I'm on lookout, but couldn't watch
It's terrible the scenario got me going till it's burial
Kept it stereo, so we buried him with his radio
Some niggas robbed him and shot him took his hat keys
Left his head a hole in the front, with no backpiece
I'm stressin', some voices on both sides of my head
One says, ""chill,"" the other's like, ""them niggas gotta be dead""
Instead we all went to they block, 'bout to flip on a clip
The full clip in my shit, and tight grip on the pit
The serious slow, them kids was curious and shook
like, ""who's that with the clenched fist tryin to pinch the crook?""
""Who killed my man last week? y'all niggas is asked, man, speak!""
Before I could shoot this old man put his hands on my damn heat
He said, ""I was sent as your guardian, you're the only one that can see me
Killing him won't bring your friend back to life, son, believe me""

(Chorus)
I'm your Angel
You're my Angel

(Verse 2)
Yo, I'm in the crib, high, lazy, blastin' my new Jay-Z
Shorty I fuck with starts buzzin' my hip crazy
Call her back, ""You horny again??"" lemme find out
She's crying all hysterical I couldn't get a line out
Said her baby father wreckless, jealous over the necklace
Beat her up good and peeled of in a Lexus
""Shorty, I'm over there, sit still, just chill""
In the Ac', pedal floored with the gat onboard
That's when I heard, ""You willing to meet the law for a broad?""
What the...Grabbed my heat, ""Who the FUCK in my back seat?""
He said, ""Be cool, nigga, right now you a fool, nigga
Pass it up, 'cause she might be settin' your ass up or what
You and son bump heads, get to clappin'
Get locked up for life and it could've been avoided
But your male pride destroyed it, eager to bust chrome
You need to bust a you-ey, son, and go the FUCK back home.""

What should I do to this kid right here?
This kid right here is soft, man.
Bitch ass nigga, watch this, watch this...

(Verse 3)
This kid ran up on the next, attempting to front on him [yo]
Got so close to money's face looked like he put his toungue on him
Blew the blunt on him, swung on him, spit a lung on him
Taking money's stuff off him, heard ""Ayo, get the fuck off him!""
Get off him? Who dat? Who said that, YOU black?
""Yeah, give his jewels back, put ya tool back you fuckin' new jack.
You ain't gon' use that you're a cool cat, trying to rep
And I know you ?? goin' to do something you're gon' regret [what?]
Don't forget it's daylight, not late night, look 8 flights up
She's Jake's wife, snake type, better take flight [word?]
or feel the snake bite, right? Bet you didn't even see her
Cat with the reefer peeped her, shit, I didn't see her either
On the phone rattin' you, pointin' at you like a statue
Get rid of the gat, dude, out my face before I smack you""

Always told me he lookin out on what's best for me

But why order me, tell me school was top priority
Givin mad hints, thinkin like it's got to more to me

A matter of fact, we can scrap on the traintracks
And the loser lays flat and get his frame smacked

Most niggas call me Selfish
>But when I get this grape eight with purple thongs>, call me ¡°Welch's¡±
Kirk's the type did a perp' with your wife
On turnpikes with dirtbikes
No shirts, with ice
Word life - so hot I could flame-throw
Chain glow - like sunshowers, so when it's bright the ice rainbow(Bling!)
Cats is wired like phone poles
Instead of throwin' blows
They let chrome go
And duck po-po
And play low-pro
In the next state
'Til Jake see 'em in the lake with eight in they chest-plate
Niggas test weight when you play they 'hood like it's all good
Start blowin' like Suge and your dashboard's all wood
Rims 18 inch
And your boys switch cars
Like rich stars
Drinkin' liquor in strip bars
Puffin' cigars
You won't get far - 'fore they stop you
Watch you, then bop through on a late night and pop you(bow!)
Brag they shot you and celebrate
Make their props elevate - from featherweight to heavyweight
I know cats that talk with they mouths closed like Garfield
Speak on hard steel
That'll make you cartwheel over the guard-rail
Cut, cut, cut, cut!
Niggas can't fuck around, cut, cut!

Now you're in a cell praying to the Unseen

Gettin' your back torn out with loud screams
While I'm on the scene with rings and nice things
Nothing compares to the heat my gat' bring

Puttin' work in - pop charts plus the urban

Have y'all niggas goin' to war, tryin' to slug it

A top secret formula had been stolen from the research lab 

We had a job to do 

We ran all suspects name through R&I and came up with 



(King Kirk) 

Respond like James Bond to this con named Don 

Milli ons in his palms  sellin' neutron bombs 

Time 6 a.m.  agent mayhem and eight men  no maybe ten 

Came to scoop me in the Benz in the ??Graham?? 

Money involved? Say when  gave me a beige Range and thangs 

But they claimed the Range changed to a plane, strange 

But perfect, showed me circuits and how to work it 

Wounds- how to nurse it, weapons- how to burst it 

Searched it, like a serpent, read the blueprints 

Dime be with two chinks sportin' links and new minks 

Drive a six with dark tints and one of the chinks 

Named Dinks and Dinks always drinks so he thinks he's invinc' 

Other chinks a wimp, but Teflon's his vest holds 

If he think you gonna roll, he'll put holes in your dress code/ 

Time to load and hit the highway, I'ma do it my way 

Spy way, do or die way, Schwarzenegger, True Lie way! 

So I pulled up on the drive way, ran through the side way 

Saw his compadres, motherfucker, yippee kay-ah 

Die hard!, nigga yelled ""my God!"", caught an Uzi scar, 

Hit the tar, other bullet to the car, ""Ah!"" 

Time to pay him back, time to fade him 

Got up tried to spray him, no aim, so I grenade him/ 

Didn't get the Don but the bombs was a factor 

Found what I was after, set the reactors 

For two minutes, heard laughter and ""lieutenant you finished"" 

It was the Don with a Smitheth, Wessun to my chestun 

For a second I thought I was dead, no more said 

Then I heard shots of lead and lead sped through his forehead 

Brando with the ammo and Dubez with the Uz' 

Move into plane rovers, motherfucker, we spy hunters

Pigs can't stop no, Sporty Thiev Gestapo, 

They sickened against flip whips to saw you slick and 

Out the fender, yo, no retreat no surrender 

To the fullest, that's why my toys deflect bullets! 

On the cell like ""Who in charge? Get me the sarge"" 

Your squad car next, your fam reached my garage 

Espio-nage, yo my fate on the rocks 

I blow 'em out the box, firin missiles on roadblocks 

On the verge on smack-ups, forces callin for back-up 

Chunked in the trunk, 200 ki's to crack up 

Breathe holdin's essential, spy-hunter utensils 

Four govermentals with four sets of dentals

OK! feel ten through your steel, man 

Yo we come together like foreign lea-ders 

Livin large in Argen-tina, camouflaged in Kor-ea, 

In the bushes where they can't see-us 

Spin astro 16 silence-face screw ons 

Mission impossible, merge em to the Persians 

With 2 glocks to my head, enuff cream to flip the script 

Got niggaz watchin the Feds, twenty ultra-red 

Beams comin through my window, tear-gas bleak up my glass, 

The smoke blew the crib-bo, the coke moves are ditto 

Layin blue in Beirut, sneak-in weed-in Swe-den 

Shook the D's in Peru, like a crooked Batman 

With no partner but still (robbing/Robin), 

Trails be mind-bogglin, leave the D's followin 

My front man, I be the big man behind the front man 

Front man got knocked? Big man still be the trump man 

Mix six crews and their glues, skully low smokin ni-ckles 

Runnin' up in cold blocks with ic-icles, spray the trey-nickle 

Guaranteed to hit you, if I miss you 

Bullets will probably ricochet and nip you 

And fall like the Berlin wall 

Hang 'em off ??the terror spies?? lets make a ball 

Crooked navy seals with flak-on, sniffin, getting they crack on

What then?  Nothing, you gon' be shocked like STOP
Your man laying there dropped other laying there shot
Think not, what come the war burdens for certain
You be laying with no shirt in the dirt with blood squirting
Knocked out and stomped out with soles and timbs
Piss in your face, wake you up, and do the whole shit again
Smack your men for jumping in, and get our rob on
Rock on pop gone long gone with your watch on
When cops swarm exit on some Next shit
You with the paramedics, we on poles doing calisthetics
So yo get the fuck away from my car move back

Either act like you know
Or you best go ask
See my Lex go past give niggas the whiplash
Class smoking grass until the whip crashed
At last who prays to god for talents to rhyme Lord?
Time is toured not poured like on the Concorde
Sit back and laugh
We made it baby shake gravy
Catch me on 180 with the yankee Flip Avery
You sick baby
Cause niggas look different now
With tighter rhymes written hell niggas is living now
And we spitting like WOW them kids is hot I need a dub
NIGGA we see the love rock a block beat a blood
We be in a club
With girls V.I.P. smoking
Scoping now she open posing holding trojans
This the life we got
Girls kissing the dice
Two keys for one rice
Probably fixing it twice
Kicking down bikes
They fall like dominos
Fifty in a row
Rock a block with that kinda dough

Man a help dem brother up di ladder, 
Money a run and every man a share the pleasure, 
No man nah seh dem bigger or better or richer,

And wi see every man a try , nah be hitcher, 
Food a run and evey man a eat.

Peace a when yu see yu enemy and a the least, 
Peace is when yu leff yu window open an a sleep, 
Peace is when you Tivoli man dem and not even pin deh pon dem, 
And dem a go up west street, 
We mean peace, 
Peace is when Dudus a bun him chalice up a Zeeks, 
Peace is when no gun nuh bust fi weeks pon top a weeks, 
Peace is when police dem get an ease and nuh haffi run like dem a thief 
Because we gunfire cease. 

Verse2:

Spragga Benz,"[Verse One]
I'm the most critically acclaimed, rap bitch in the game
Coast to coast, stash the gat in holster girl
Dark skinned, Christian Dior poster girl
Mo' rockin Timbs bitch and the Gucci loafers girl
Niggaz say I'm too pretty to spit rhymes this gritty
Fuck y'all thought?  Be dancin around in suits like I'm {Diddy}
Pretty, show niggaz how we run this city
Respect my name, Boogie nigga, stay in ya lane
Like The Hurricane, rains on bitches like Sugar Shane
And dare one of y'all rappin chicks to mention Fox name
""What's Beef?"" beef is when bitches think it's sweet
See y'all frontin in the streets and let my gat meet ya

[Chorus]
Why Yoooooooo, Why yo yo yo
Why Yoooooooo, Why yagga ya yo
Why Yoooooooo, Why yo yo yo
Why Yoooooooo, Why yagga ya yo (yagga yo)

[Verse Two]
Check, uhh
It's like I'm in my own fuckin world, I speak how I feel
Sometimes I feel like I'm just too fuckin real
I love to stack riches, no disrespect y'all
I respect the rap game, but I don't fuck with rap bitches
I'm speakin from my heart
It's not that I'm too good, I'm just hood
Been like this from the fuckin start
Since I bust my gun in ninety-six
Y'all never see me flick up with them fake-ass chicks
Bitches smile up in your face, turn around and pop shit
You a industry bitch, I'm in the streets bitch
I might breeze through Prada, Chloe or Tiffs
But, other than that it's just me and my six

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I dream filthy
My moms and pops mixed it with the Trini' rum and whiskey
Uhh, proper set off
Six sped off, gats let off, I speak calm
Gangsta, and pours off like Screechie Don, bwoy
Who y'all know rock Prada like Fox
Pop bottles in the back of the cellar with Donatella
Cartier wrist wear, Pasha Kay face
Got niggaz stand in line just to get a sneak taste
Act like y'all don't know I keeps gat beneath waist
And like a hundred thou' each crib in each safe
When Fox come through she have a gun in the place
I'm like Marion Jones, what, who the FLUCK wan' race?
Listen, never trippin, never catch Brown slippin
Fuck, y'all only nice around mics like Pippen
Shit, to all my thugs that's Blood'n or Crip'n
I'm still shittin, still lowridin and switch-hittin nigga

Spragga Benz,"Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block
Didn't know you 
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you 
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on
They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun
Didn't know that you 
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on
Bet you nobody ever told you that you

Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
We're jammin', jammin', jammin', jam on
You ask me am I happy
Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
'Cause we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star
You didn't know that you

I bet you if someone approached you 
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Yesterday to tell you that you would be jammin' 
You would not believe it 
Because you never thought that you would be jammin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh,

Under her spell she had me crushed
I sworn I was anointed
Got caught by her magic

With her sexual motion

Suck on her love potion

You got something that could change your life
Use that moment just to show you're alive

And you just might find it
And there's some around who wanna keep you down

Hey, feeling trapped, thinking that you can't get out of this humdrum scene
Time to turn this thing upside down
Show these people what you really mean

Ever think that you could lose your mind
Could it be the big dream you'll find
No more waiting cause it's almost time

Tryna get this thing right

There's nothing wrong with writing total nonsense lyrics,

There may well be some truth in that but I think it's a rumor.

You probably drive a Volvo car and read Financial Times.

Spunge,"My mother told me that I would get stronger if,
I could just keep my attention for a little longer on
One girl, any girl, just a normal kind of girl,
Take time to ponder but that girl, any girl,
I'll give anything a twirl, I tend to wander
And I wish I didn't have a Rov- ingeye

Every girl in this place looks good to me, me, me.
Every girl in this place looks good enough to eat, eat, eat.
Every girl in this place looks good to me, me, me.
Every girl in this place looks good enough to eat, eat, now..

When I go out drinking I try to be good but,
I find myself flirting with people that I know I shouldn't,
Tall ones, short ones, 'specially the taut ones, I love them all,
With their long hair, short hair wearing almost underwear, say less is more.
And I wish I didn't have a roving eye......

Every girl in this place looks good to me, me, me.
Every girl in this place looks good enough to eat, eat, eat.
Every girl in this place looks good to me, me, me.
Every girl in this place looks good enough to eat, eat, now..

Well I'm here to tell ya that it can be trouble,
If you're going steady don't bother going for the double,
It's hard not to look, like a fish on a hook, surrounded by ladies.

Lovely lil thing but a bit of a dreamer
She's been married for three long years
Got three children and they're all lil dears
But
Now she's bored with her married bliss
So
She goes out on the town, has a bit of this and that
Guy ment nothing, one night stand
Test turned blue, got much more on her hands

uh-oh, its all gone wrong and (X3)
ITS ALL GONE WRONG

derek knew she worked at the supermarket
So while out on a drive decided to go and park it
Down by the river, walked to the store
Never got the courage up2 talk2 her before
But he'd been up practisin all last night
Plannin what he's gonna say
Makin sure it sounded right
As he turned the corner by the milk and orange juice
Playin tonsil hockey with the spotty guy from fresh produce

...... was a guy that fully understood
That the car that you drive is an extension of you're manhood
As you can imagine, never let her down
Entered the equation wen he drove his cadillac around
Pretty damn long pretty damn wide
2 silver lightenin bolts painted down the side
Imagine his grief, pity his pain
Both broke down one mornin and never started up again

played the guitar in his best mates band
He knew that they'd get far
All they needed was a helping hand
When practising one evenin there was a knock at the door
Opened up to see a guy no one had ever seen before
Introduced himself as bob the talent scout
Handed them a form, told them they should fill it out
They're still practisin in fred's backroom

And her voice is sweet like candy
She's an angel

You wanna keep your distance
There's just one big problem
And that's her damn persistence
And I know her
It's just one smile bowls you over

And you may well put up a fight
But she's still gonna stay the night
It's all that she ever wants
And then she gets inside your head
You won't remember what you said
It's all that she ever wants
And then she crawls inside your skin
You won't know what a mess you're in
It's all that she ever wants
And no she hasn't got a clue
Of what the hell she wants to do

Well she's not even faithfull
But you don't even blame her
If you were that fine then
You would be the same and
You don't own her
But ask her nicely and she'll show ya

When you first met her
The match was made in heaven
Little did you know
You were the fifth one out of seven
But you still stay there
And you're still acting like you don't care

She's still deciding
What it is she wants to do
But you know that her long term plans
Don't include you
But you're still hoping
It's your special way of coping

She absent minded and
She may forget your name
But your caught up in her
And you love just the same

People try and live too fast, just one life make it last
There's no need to rush to get along

I enjoy things I've got, even when they're not a lot
Main goal in my life is have a laugh
I don't know, even though I'm older
Still don't like doing what I'm told
I don't really wanna get along

I'm just here to have fun, not to dictate anyone
I don't really wanna get along
Maybe my view's out of date, I don't care, ain't life great
I don't really wanna get along

No, no, no, no, not one bit, 'cause we're

Walking under green leaves at last
Walking under green leaves at last

There's something so nice about driving down here with you
Please just a few more hours, I don't wanna drive back to town yet

Day is winding down
Nothing is really earned or gained by denying this
Thanks for the few more hours
You sleep now, I'm feeling alright to drive
'Cause the sun sets late this time of year
And I've been deprived of it for so many months
It's leaving me again
I don't wanna miss one minute of it
No, no, no, no, not tonight

Spyro Gyra,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more 

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more",In My Life,1995
Spyro Gyra,"There is a young cowboy, he lives on the range
His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

Now the first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
The Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me

So goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams

Mike's motorcycle crashed and almost everything broke
Brenda had addictions that she fought with her soul

Keep making them whole
So, for the girl who like to cut herself
I'm hoping you know
That God ain't forgot you
Your pain's what he want
Meaning your overcome is through Alpha, Omega,
And one day I know that this will be all behind us
Trying already to get my crown ready

Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer

It shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time

Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you

I'm that feeling when you can't leave

When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected 
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

Listen as she lets you know
Swallow as she chokes

and the colors look so beauiful
As you stare up from the ground
You hear the feet of the passerby
And vomit from the sound

Sat herself beside me in my van

A flat the council give her, 
Wallpaper very scenic 
Her outlook very beatnik, 
We watched the close and weather 
Then through the door he entered, 
Short sleeves and arms of iron 
And me with just my tie on, 
She said the lodger's used to this by now 
I'd handled all the bull but not the cow.

Home is a love that I miss very much
So the past has been bottled and labeled with love

He like a cowboy died drunk in a slumber
Out on the porch in the middle of summer
She crossed the ocean back home to her family
But they had retired to roads that were sandy
She moved home alone without friends or relations
Lived in a world full of age reservations
A moth eaten object she'd say that she'd sod all her friends
Who had left her to drink from her bottle

Home is a love that I miss very much
So the past has been bottled and labeled with love

Squeeze,"She wants to give up love for good 
She kicks the fence and splits the wood, 
She cries her eyes out in the rain 
She swears aloud and so again, 
She feels messed around. 
She takes her coat off as it pours 
The passing daytime she ignores, 
Sits with a problem on a bench 
And with her heel she digs a trench, 
She feels messed around. 
She rips her skirt and tears her dress 
Climbing over his garden fence, 
Mud on her mourning as tears still fall 
She's in no mood for his love at all, 
She feels messed around 

Her door won't shut, her match won't light, 
The bulb went out, her skirts too tight, 
She feels messed around. 
The words don't match, her heart won't heal, 
The phone won't pip, her fruit won't peel, 
She feels messed around.

But always kept off of his cloud,

Squeeze,"Eyebrows plucked and toenails cut, 
I'll pick you up with a little luck, all prim and proper. 
Shaven legs and calls to Fred, 
It all depends o' alright then, I can not stop her.

Ever such a lot of odds and sods, in there to offer. 
She needs paints to make her face, 
And make her late again and again

Coming out, 
Coming out to play?

None of these girls would ever care, 
Or get upset.

Short and fat with a fishnet hat, 
And a hungry cat in a nice new flat, with her Scrabble. 
Sits by the phone when she's all alone, 
And on her own it's a mental home, full of babble. 
Writes with charm to uncle farm, 
With a broken arm in a broken barn, feeds the cattle. 
She hears the hens as she takes the pen, 
And it's now and now it's then [and now and then a little arab friend], 
She would saddle.

She sits in a towel with a purple hair dryer, 
She waits to get even with me. 
She hooks up her cupcakes and puts on her jumper

She meets me in Piccadilly. 
A begging folk singer stands tall by the entrance 
His song relays worlds of most good intentions, 
A fiver a ten p in his hat for collection.

His wife won't be pleased but she's not been round lately.

We escaped in the rain for an Indian curry, 
At the candle lit Taj Mahal.

My mind took a devious role. 
 
The cab took us home through a night I'd not noticed 
The neon club lights of adult films and Trini Lopez, 
My arm around love but my acting was hopeless. 

We crept like two thieves from the kettle to the fire 
We kissed to the sound of the silence that we'd hired, 
Now captured, your love in my arms. 
A door opened slightly a voice spoke in worry

In other people's beds. 
And if the grass seems greener, 
But it turns out to be blue 
The garden of Eden isn't quite the place for you. 
Don't be surprised if I'm gone under the spell, 
Of some other witches' wand 
Ringing someone else's bell. 

Meeting on the motorway 
Your lover boy blue, 
Steaming up the windows 
With your last breath of youth.

There's people on the streets but no one that I know

I know not where they go.

Same heart different feeling,

And my notebook surprised to find that 
Love is not so new, 
So we both took

There's no aggression,

Her dumbness in taking the stock 
Sees her reflection in a butcher's shop. 
She finds it all quite rare 
That her meat's all vanity fair. 

She has her eyes on medallion men 
Who get her home on the dot at ten, 
She combs her hair when she gets excused 
The deal she wants always ends up screwed. 
Paints her nails on the bathroom scales 
Gargles her breath like a landed whale, 
Her beauty is as deep as her skin 
Keeps her eyebrows in a tobacco tin.

Coconut shy but vanity fair. 

In her vanity case her compact case

Not bad for a sister 
But her vanity's fair and her sense of humour's dry.

Tie her down 
But she likes to wear the crown of the kingdom. 

She like the recipes a touch of oriental

The problem is computed and always it's rejected, 
Out of her heart I catch a spark,

The crown is left out in the dark now there's no kingdom. 

Fed up with the glory she abdicates her title 
Sitting at a bar stool she gives her day's recital, 
The family watch in horror 
As she staggers up the hallway 
Makes herself a sandwich 
As they're looking through the doorway, 
She goes to bed 
Leg by leg, 
Nothing's said 
There's no crown upon her head there's no kingdom.

She lets loose all the horses

And arrows in his hat

And davy crockett rides around

They get a gang of villains
In a shed up at heathrow
They're counting out the fivers
When the handcuffs lock again

Who swear like how's your father

They sat like salt and pepper
Looking out across the city
From Lover's Leap is pretty

He told her how he loved her
Next night he called for her
But Dad protected daughter
And told him she was poorly

Where he felt anti-social

And crashed out in the back seat

He acted cool and cocky

With me and the girl from Clapham
Out on the windy common
That night I ain't forgotten
When she dealt out the rations
With some or other passions
I said ""you are a lady""
""Perhaps"" she said. ""I may be""

We moved in to a basement
With thoughts of our engagement
We stayed in by the telly
Although the room was smelly
We spent our time just kissing
The Railway Arms we're missing
But love had got us hooked up
And all our time it took up

I got a job with Stanley
He said I'd come in handy
And started me on Monday
So I had a bath on Sunday
I worked eleven hours
And bought the girl some flowers
She said she'd seen a doctor
And nothing now could stop her

I worked all through the winter
The weather brass and bitter
I put away a tenner
Each week to make her better
And when the time was ready
We had to sell the telly
Late evenings by the fire
With little kicks inside her

This morning at four fifty
I took her rather nifty
Down to an incubator
Where thirty minutes later
She gave birth to a daughter
Within a year a walker
She looked just like her mother
If there could be another

And now she's two years older
Her mother's with a soldier
She left me when my drinking
Became a proper stinging
The devil came and took me
From bar to street to bookie
No more nights by the telly
No more nights nappies smelling

Alone here in the kitchen

I laugh at myself when your son 
Is watching cartoons 
In the morning he's looking up at me 
When we're in the bathroom 
Sees me kissing mother 
Doesn't blink an eye 
Asks a lot of questions 
Answers hard to find.

I talk to myself when I'm drunk 
And she is still sober 
Words are so few and far between 
My arms reach to hold her 
Hungry for the love

By luck or labour 
She likes love 
But not for favour - can't hold on

Looks up to me but her eyes see nothing, 
Love's her stare 
The steps to her heart 
Love's the climb 
The bite not her bark.

I'm John Wayne as I'm walking towards her, 
She'd like to dance 
But not this minute 
She's the fish I'd love to fillet.

Her cocktails shaken

Disabled love with a word of dribble
On and on about some jumbled subject
I said your friends were a bunch of muppets

Said your sister should've grown a moustache
Said you didn't need to take off your mask
Down the staircase I made my stagger
I left you cryin' but it didn't matter

And so I sat inside my car in wonder
A headache in my head like the thunder
I chewed my nails like a guilty victim
I couldn't see or feel the night or nothin' 
I wanted to explain, but oh so clever
Love was like it was some endeavor
Then I don't remember who said what, when
On a stack of paper I placed my pen

And when I woke up in the mornin'
Beside you in the bed
My mouth was full of nothin'
My arms around your head

Leaves another chin and another hair cut

My wimpy tales 
Fanning her face from cigar smoke

From her trail

Sparkled in darkness 
She was the love

Like a knife

Lit by the fire

In a sea of its own

I had to admire 
Through a whore's breath of stories

Right out of her chair 
She led me away and I 
Was then slaughtered

Falling in the hall on top of the cat

He wanders inside on tiptoes 
And brews up some coffee 
He's shaking and sweating again

To save the love of her friend

Sorting it out 
She cannot take it when he tells lies 
And sneaks off out of the room 
Returning like somebody's lost balloon 

Tea leaves sit in an empty cup 
No expression on his face 
The TV's showing commercials 
He's back in her arms again 
No more the drugs and the drinking 
Her heart can stop sinking 
Now that he's home once again 
She knows that tough love is needed

I keep crying in my sleep 

Breaking up 
Is making me see 
Inside myself again 
And if I can keep looking 
Inside then I might change the things that I fear

My nights are incomplete 
I keep crying in my sleep 

The sound of her voice 
The sound of her words 
I hear every breath 
Each whisper is heard 
But it's so hard now 
Now she is gone 
Everything I did I did wrong 
I keep crying in my sleep 

And if I turn full circle

A scar on his cheek

This boy doesn't get love 

He stalks the club with eagle eyes 
Springing on his heels 
Likes to throw a hand of dice 
Then hang them in his wheels

Who thinks he has taste

Standing at the end of the bar 
He feels helpless when she looks in his eyes 
Suddenly there's love in his heart

I'm taking off and touching down

His thin moustache stretched on his face 

Gone to the dogs the man and his life

Confused by the thoughts 
That stew in his mind 
Alone by the track on a Saturday night 

Gone to the dogs

Are taken by the girls who serve

It's all the love there is tonight. 
I can't be brave enough 
She cannot say what we're feeling 
Day after day 
We're going through the motions 
We find it hard to let each other go

He looked at the phone

Satisfied that this was it 
A rhythmic breath and a gentle grip 
Satisfied and they were sure 
They couldn't fulfill each other more 

They stroked each other 
He played with her hair 
Deep in a warm sedation 
The legs of his jeans 
Hung over the chair 
Love was their meditation

She looked at his eyes 
The look there told her he was satisfied

She was busy looking through the curtains
Her nose in a distant void
Then I thought I would come back as a spider
Because she hates them so much
They get sprayed down the bathroom plughole
Can I expect the same touch
Maybe not then
Because beneath it all were wicked and cruel

Shut up, listen to the radio

Able to reason, prosper and plan

We became the monkeys riding the race

SR-71,"From the minute that I met here she was different than the rest
But I didn't hear her talking I was staring at her chest
And I wish I would have listened 'cause I think I might have seen the signs
Now it's been a couple months and I can'why take another word

She's been pushing every button she's been working every nerve
I've got something she can swallow it sure as hell's not my pride
And I know it's just a waste of time
Soon I'm gonna run out of lies

She'll just have to hear the truth instead
Everyday I'm gonna make her cry
Till the minute that we said goodbye
I'm gonna make her wish... she was dead

I used to hang out with my homies gettin stupid every night
Till I met her and she chained me up to keep me out of sight
I got to get away from her I think I'm running out of time
'Cause I think I'm gonna die whenever she's behind the wheel

And it drives me up the wall when she asks me how I feel
I don't really want to talk so I tell her that I'm doing fine
There's got to be a way that I can get it through her head
I'm going crazy and she won't let me go

The lease gets tighter every day
Already told her she's Miss Right Now
But I wish she was Miss Yesterday",She Was Dead,2002
SR-71,"I can be as humble as the next guy
Or I can blink and make you crumble from the inside
I can be every nasty thing you ever dreamt a man could be
Cause they all fall down
I can make you see the beauty of a new sun
Or I can be the source of your desperation
I can every nasty thing you ever dreamt a man could be
Jaded dated I'm the type you hated
Haunted

Taunted but I'm what you always wanted
Yeah yeah I'm what you always wanted
You can turn away like you don't even see me
You can smile and act like you got something I need
But every night you go home alone and dream about being underneath me
Can't you see through this disguise

If I was a little younger would I care?
Feeling like the walls are growing stronger

You never dreamed you'd have to
Live your life so guarded

Make you feel discarded

I'm only scared of myself

SR-71,"Blood and dust have changed all the colors in my mind
Black has made me see but the truth has made me blind
To the fears
To the lies

They were here
All the time
In your sympathetic Sunday night I don't belong
Till all the hate that lines the face of my enemy is gone

To the fears
To the lies
They were here
All the time

The mouth of New York City talks
Spitting dust from streets to sidewalks
Pictures soaked in gasoline
Twisting through the steel and concrete

The smoke has cleared but I can't breathe
The new day is a prison for the souls who've lost hope
But I've been taught change comes to the ones who need it most
All the fears

All the lies
They were here

She never had it all
One prozac a day
Husband's a C.P.A.
Her dreams went out the door
Once she turned twenty four
Only been with one man
What happened to her plans
She was gonna be an actress
She was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake that ass
On the hood of Whitesnake's car
Now her SUV has become the enemy
Looks at her average life
Nothing has been alright

Fast Times At Ridgemont

Never knew George was gay
Hoped they'd hook up one day
Where's her fairy tale, where's her dream?
Where's the quarterback from her high school football team?

Where's her dream?
How many times will she ask herself what happened to me?

Does it really matter how I feel

Days pass and this emptiness fills my heart
When I want to run away
I drive off in my car
But whichever way I go
I come back to the place you are

And the grand facade, so soon will burn
Without a noise, without my pride
I reach out from the inside

In your eyes
The light the heat
In your eyes
I am complete
In your eyes
I see the doorway to a thousand churches
In your eyes
The resolution of all the fruitless searches
In your eyes
I see the light and the heat
In your eyes
Oh, I want to be that complete
I want to touch the light
The heat I see in your eyes

Love, I don't like to see so much pain
So much wasted and this moment keeps slipping away
I get so tired of working so hard for our survival
I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive

SR-71,"You like when we go fast
So my foot's on the brake
Used to be my girl
But now you're just my worst mistake
You don't see it, not a subtle change
Makes me laugh you turned into a cliche

Everytime you told me
That we'd never say goodbye... was a lie
You knew what to expect from me
Just like a hit of exctasy
You made me high

You think I still want you
After all you put me through
You think I can't walk away
And find someone better for me
Just take your overactive ego
Shrink it down like a mosquito
Baby lovin you was such a chore
Til I got bored
Now I don't think about you anymore

From the first time I saw you naked
I could see the future
I knew that my world was shaken
Lost my innocence then I lost my mind
Thank god now I see
Cause with you I must have been blind cause

Everytime you told me
That we'd never say goodbye... was a lie
Just like a common criminal
You gave me just the minimal to
Keep me hanging on inside

Now that I can breathe
I'm done with therapy
It's your turn to burn
Covered up in lies
And still so full of pride
I hope you choke
Cause its the sex I'll miss the most",Mosquito,2005

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.
