Supersubmarina,"Háblame
No quiero quedarme dormido
Los sueños están bien
Pero es mejor estar contigo

Mirar al mar
Tomar el sol
Arena y sal
Ginebra y ron

Túmbate, que si los dos estamos tendidos
Se que así ya no te vas
Me quedo mucho más tranquilo

Y al respirar
La brisa y tú
Me dais la paz
El cielo azul, parece estar un poco más limpio

Y los que van a parar, siempre al mar volverán
Somos igual, por favor, no me sueltes jamás
No me quiero volver a perder
Solo quiero estar donde tú estés

Gritame, que no te oigo con tanto ruido
Necesito verte más
Dame la mano que yo te sigo

Quiero correr
Cerca de ti
Si no está bien
Podemos ir a conocer algún otro sitio

Y los que van a parar, siempre al mar volverán
Somos igual, por favor, no me sueltes jamás
No me quiero volver a perder
Solo quiero estar donde tú estés

Y los que van a parar, siempre al mar volverán
Somos igual, por favor, no me sueltes jamás
No me quiero volver a perder
Solo quiero estar donde tú estés
Donde tú estés.",Arena y Sal,2014
Supersubmarina,"Te busco en el hueco que queda en mi alma
Tan frío y profundo que no encuentro nada
Quisiera volverme invisible
Y colarme esta noche en tu cama

Me acuesto a la sombra de un árbol sin ramas
Las dudas y el miedo me sirven de almohada
Dormirme seria imposible
La hierba me escuece en la cara

Que cada vez que te vuelva a mirar
Me resulte más fácil morir
Que obligarme a decir la verdad
El rayo que no cesa en mar en calma
Faro entre la niebla viento de cara
Viento de cara

La luna se asoma y parece de plata
El sol le hace frente al llegar la mañana
Quisiera que fuera invencible
Y que nunca jamás se apagara

Que cada vez que te vuelva a mirar
Me resulte más fácil morir
Que obligarme a decir la verdad
El rayo que no cesa en mar en calma
Enfado entre la niebla y viento de cara
Viento de cara

Que cada vez que te vuelva a mirar
Me resulte más fácil morir
Que obligarme a decir la verdad
Que cada vez que te vuelva a mirar
Me resulte más fácil morir
Que obligarme a decir la verdad
El rayo que no cesa en mar en calma
Enfado entre la niebla viento de cara

Supersuckers,"An elaborate tale
So convincingly real
Things can seem so amazing
'Til you get up close
And see they're no big deal

Like the stars in the sky
Or the one on the stage
Just a big ball of gas
And a regular guy
Fresh out of minimum wage

In a jackalope space, on a jackalope high
I'm staring you down, creepy jackalope eye

Many things in this life
Are not what they appear
Yeah, I look like a hare
But if you stop and you stare
I'm related to a deer

I got a jackalope face, I'm a jackalope guy
And I'm staring you down, creepy jackalope eye

Is it so hard to imagine
Is it so hard to believe
Something so outrageous
Something so far fetched
Well how 'bout Adam and Eve?

I know you gotta have faith
I know the need to hope
But the truth is always in place
It's right in front of my face
The mighty jackalope, yeah

In a jackalope space, on a jackalope high
I'm staring you down, creepy jackalope
And I'm staring down, creepy jackalope

And I'm staring you down, creepy jackalope eye
Freaky jackalope eye, creepy jackalope eye
Creepy jackalope eye
",Creepy Jackalope Eye,1994
Supersuckers,"It's a bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flying down to Houston
Forgetting her, the nature of my flight
(Chorus)

As we taxi toward the runway
With the smog and haze reminding me
Of how I feel
Just a country boy who's learning
That the pitfalls of the city are extremely real

All the nightlife and the parties
Temptation and deceit
The order of the day
We'll it's a bloody Mary morning
And I'm leaving baby
Somewhere in L.A.

(Chorus)

Our golden jet is airborne
And flight #50 cuts a path across the morning sky
And a voice comes through the speaker
Reassuring us flight #50 is the way to fly
And a hostess takes our order
Coffee, tea, or something stronger to start off the day
It's a bloody Mary morning
And I'm leaving baby somewhere in L.A.

(Chorus)",Bloody Mary Morning,1996
Supersuckers,"He was standing on the highway
Somewhere way out in the sticks
Guitar across his shoulder
Like a 30 ought six
He was staring in my headlights
When I come around the bend
Climbed up on my shotgun side
And told me with a grin

I'm going to New York City
I never really been there
Just like the way it sounds
I heard the girls are pretty
There must be something happening there
It's just too big a town

He was cold and wet and hungry
Never did complain
Said he'd come a thousand miles
Through sleet and snow and rain
He had a hundred stories
About the places that he'd been
He'd hang around a little while
And hit the road again

He's going to New York City
I never really been there
Just like the way it sounds
He heard the girls are pretty
There must be something happening there
It's just too big a town

See I've been to New York City
Seems like it was yesterday
I was standing like a pilgrim
On the Great White Way
The girls were really pretty
But they wouldn't talk to me
I held out about a week
Went back to Tennessee

So, I thought I'd better warn him
When he climbed out of my car
Grabbed his battered suitcase
Shouldered his guitar
I knew I was just jealous
If I didn't wish him well
I slipped the kid a twenty
Said 'Billy give 'em hell'

He's going to New York City
I never really been there
Just like the way it sounds
He heard the girls are pretty
There must be something happening there
It's just too big a town

He's going to New York City
I never really been there
Just like the way it sounds
He heard the girls are pretty
There must be something happening there
It's just too big a town

Supersuckers,"Now, I've been taken for way too long
And I had my share of broken hearts
I've been mistaken and I've really been wronged
Now it's tearing me apart

I've got a heart so full of love
It's gonna blow you away
Tried to resist it but you'll take it anyway
And I know it'll blow you away

I got this thing, it's a thing about you
And how you're driving me insane, yeah
Don't wanna cry but what else can I do
Guess I'll just drink it in the pain

I've got a heart so full of love
It's gonna blow you away
Tried to resist it but you take it anyway
And I know it'll blow you away

If you could look inside my soul
Then you could see the love I hold
I'm not the kind of guy who says this everyday
I just want to blow you away, alright now

I've got a heart so full of love
It's gonna blow you away
Tried to resist it but you'll take it anyway
And I know it'll blow you away
Yeah, I just want to blow you away
Oh, I just want to blow you away
",Blow You Away,1997
Supersuckers,"I kind of bump around and I wonder
What I'm feeling like and what I do
I take a look around and I'm underwhelmed
With my big bad self

I will walk in hell, so are you

I kind of roll along without anger
When they're giving me their evil eye
'Cause I've been coming down like a stranger
Something 'bout 'em rings the bell

[Incomprehensible]
You must've have been high
I walked the hell, I must've been high

Yeah, we're one cigarette away, sure has been fun
Yeah, we're one cigarette away, we gotta find some place to stay
Because we're one cigarette away from being done

One drink so quickly turns into another
It's gonna take me all day tomorrow to recover
Over has been hung, the last fag has been bummed
And we're one cigarette away from being done, yeah

Supersuckers,"Worked the bars and sideshows along the twilight zone
Only a crowd can make you feel so alone
And it really hit home

Gotta move while its still fun
Let me walk before they make me run

What you know is true
Don't have to tell you

That no comb can get through

Talk a lot about football 
And girls I kissed in grade four 
I piss off my friends 
I'm digging a hole just staring at the floor 
Now every t-shirt has a white stain 
I'm loving cigarettes again 
I know every tune about 
Guys and girls and hurts and hearts and moans 
I miss you like sleep 
And there ain't nothing romantic about the hours I keep 
And it's the mornings when it starts

Supertramp,"Did your shadow ever speak to you?
And did he say that something's wrong?
Only a figure on a lamplit wall
Never realized he cared at all
Did he stop you going on?

Guess my shadow spoke to me tonight
And made me throw my dreams away
Told a story of a twisted man
Who was playing with some foolish plan
'Bout a girl who had flew away

Sometimes shadows are near
I see things very clear: my life unwinds
Somewhere I'll make my stand
Look around at yesterday
And change my mind

Now your shadow isn't always there
In the light of cloudy days
Or in circles where you hide from view
All the dust that ever bothered you
And where people loose your name'",Shadow Song,1970
Supertramp,"Surely there's a way I could please you
Only in your past lie the tears
Surely there's a day you can say went your way
Some illusion you can keep through the years

Only could we try to get by on a sigh
Just because, just this once, I was there",Surely,1970

There's no one to tell us what we're living for

I just know that I'll be losing very soon
And there are times and there are motions
When I do believe I'm going out of tune, oh

I've been around a long, long while
Looking for sun to make me smile
But still multiply their daily bread
They're thinking their lives put times ahead
It must be a mighty funny way to feel

Is it mine, is it mine, is it mine to know? 

I can see it's not too good to me 
To be afloat in the sea of glory 
Babaji, oh how you comfort me 
By showing me it's a different story 

Your light in the dark is real 
And I know that you know it is how I feel 
When I see the reflections that's in your eyes 
Is it mine, is it mine, is it mine to know? 

Babaji, have you a song for me 
To tell the world of its guardian angel 
Bring it out so we can sing it out 
Oh must you always remain a stranger? 

At night when the stars are near 
And I long for delusion to disappear 
The I see the reflection that's in your eyes 
Is it time, is it time, is it time to know",Babaji,1977
Supertramp,"Took a boat Sunday, down by the sea
It just felt so nice, you and me
We didn't have a problem or a care
And all around was silence, everywhere

You are the reason I was born
Be with you through all seasons
I'll always hear you when you call
We'll keep the love light shining

Through each night and day
A lonely life behind me
Oh what a change you've made

So down here on the ocean we will stay
Went through a lot of changes
Turned a lot of pages
When I took a boat Sunday

To know you as I know you now
That is all I need
And we will get along somehow
If we both believe

So down here on the ocean we will stay

Supertramp,"Even in the quietest moments
I wish I knew what I had to do
And even though the sun is shining
Well I feel the rain, here it comes again, dear
And even when you showed me
My heart was out of tune
For there's a shadow of doubt that's not letting me find you too soon
The music that you gave me
The language of my soul
Oh Lord, I want to be with you.
Won't you let me come in from the cold?

Don't you let the sun fade away
Don't you let the sun fade away
Don't you let the sun be leaving
Won't you come to me soon

And even though the stars are listening
And the ocean's deep, I just go to sleep
And then I create a silent movie
You become the star, is that what you are, dear?
Your whisper tells a secret
Your laughter brings me joy
And a wonder of feeling I'm nature's own little boy
But still the tears keep falling
They're raining from the sky
Well there's a lot of me got to go under before I get high

Don't you let the sun disappear
Don't you let the sun disappear
Don't you let the sun be leaving
No, you can't be leaving my life
Say that you won't be leaving my life
Say that you won't be leaving my life
Say won't you please, stay won't you please
Say won't you please, stay won't you please
Lord, won't you come and get into my life
Lord, won't you come and get into my life
Say won't you please, stay won't you please
Say won't you please, stay won't you please
Lord, don't go

Where have I been, was it just a dream?
And though your door is always open
Where do I begin, may I please come in, dear?",Even in the Quietest Moments,1977
Supertramp,"History recalls how great the fall can be
While everybody's sleeping, the boats put out to sea
Borne on the wings of time
It seemed the answers were so easy to find
""To late,"" the prophets (profits) cry
The island's sinking, let's take to the sky

Called the man a fool, striped him of his pride
Everyone was laughing up until the day he died
And though the wound went deep
Still he's calling us out of our sleep
My friends, we're not alone
He waits in silence to lead us all home

So tell me that you find it hard to grow
Well I know, I know, I know
And you tell me that you've many seeds to sow
Well I know, I know, I know

Can you hear what I'm saying
Can you see the parts that I'm playing
""Holy Man, Rocker Man, Come on Queenie,
Joker Man, Spider Man, Blue Eyed Meanie""

What will be your last contribution?
""Live it up, rip it up, why so lazy?
Give it out, dish it out, let's go crazy,
Yeah!""",Fool's Overture,1977
Supertramp,"Monday has come around again
I'm in the same old place
With the same old faces always watching me
Who knows how long I'll have to stay
Could be a hundred years
Of sweat and tears
At the rate that I get paid

Sometimes I slowly drift away
From all the dull routine
That's with me every day
A fantasy will come to me
Diamonds are what I really need
Think I'll rob a store, escape the law
And live in Italy

Lately my luck has been so bad
You know the roulette wheel's
A crooked deal
I'm losing all I had

Soon be like a man that's on the run
And live from day to day
Never needing anyone
Play hide and seek
Throughout the week

My life is full of romance

Guess I'll always have to be
Living in a fantasy
That's the way it's got to be

Because you can't stop the lover boy
You can't stop the lover boy

He's got a thing in his head
It's from a book he's read
It's got a funny title,
It tells you how to be vital

He took a lot of time
Over every line
Because it's guaranteed
To satisfy

He's gonna knock 'em dead
The boy's got that book read
You can't stop the lover boy
You can't stop the lover boy

Right from the clothes he wears
The way he combs his hair
You can't stop him now, because he knows all the tricks
He used to have a problem but he got it fixed

He took a small apartment
Above a shoe department
And he could see from his window
All the lights in the street glow

There's a club on the corner
And tonight he will go there
To find a new affair
So all you ladies beware

He's got to have a good time in the city

Just can't see why we disagree

Casual conversations how they bore me
They go on and on endlessly
But no matter what I say
You ignore me anyway
I might as well talk in my sleep (I could weep)

You try to make me feel so small
Until there's nothing left at all
Why go on? just hoping that we'll get along

There's no communication left between us
But is it me or you who's to blame? 
There's nothing I can do, yes you're fading out of view
Don't know if I feel joy or pain in searching

You say you're havin' fun,
But you're busy going nowhere,

You tried to be a hero,
Commit the perfect crime
But the dollar got you dancing
And you're running out of time
You're messin' up the water
You're rolling in the wine
You're poisoning your body
You're poisoning your mind
You gave me coca-cola
You said it tasted good
You watch the television
It tell you that you should

How can you live in this way? 
(why do you think it's so strange?)
You must have something to say

There must be more to this life

Find yourself a new ambition

I've heard it all before
You're saying nothing new

You cannot make me listen
I cannot make you hear

Supertramp,"It's just heartbreaking
I should have known that it would let me down
It's just a mind aching
I used to dream about this town
It was a sight to see, the place to be
Where the living is easy
And the kicks can always be found

It's such a shame about it
I used to think that it would feel so good
But who's to blame about it
So many creeps in Hollywood
I'm in this dumb motel near the Taco Bell
Without a hope in hell, I can't believe that I'm still around

Ain't nothing new in my life today
Ain't nothing true it's all gone away

I've had too much cryin', seen too much grief
I'm sick of tryin' it's beyond belief
I'm tired of talking on the telephone
They're trying to tell me that they're not at home

Ain't nothing new in my life today
I'm tired of walking from place to place
I've yet to come across a friendly face
And now the words sound familiar, as them slam the door
'You're not what we're looking for!

Ain't nothing new in my life today
Ain't nothing true it's all gone away

If we only had time, only had time for you
If we only had time, only had time for you
If we only had time, only had time for you

It was a heartbreaking
Now I ride in the big fine car
It was mind aching

I was up before the dawn
And I really have enjoyed my stay
But I must be moving on

Like a king without a castle
Like a queen without a throne
I'm an early morning lover
And I must be moving on

Now I believe in what you say
Is the undisputed truth
But I have to have things my own way
To keep me in my youth

Like a ship without an anchor
Like a slave without a chain
Just the thought of those sweet ladies
Sends a shiver through my veins

And I will go on shining
Shining like brand new
I'll never look behind me
My troubles will be few

You know I'll love you every day

When things go wrong we'll find a way

To tell you that you are
My kind of lady
I'm not the same since I met you

And then you came along
One magic night when things went right it was so fine
Looked in your eyes and realized that you were mine

And nothin' under the sun of moon
Can make us be apart

You gotta meet life and shake it by the hand
You gotta use your emotion

You talk a nice line to put your mind at ease
You wanna sit back and count your memories
But that's no solution

I don't want to harp about it
But what you gonna do about it?

Look at how you're set in your ways
You used to be so willing to face
Any kind of problem before you

Don't destroy yourself, I implore you, I implore you

You've got a fine wife, a perfect family
You had it all planned to live so carefully
But where does it get you

They say the mind is an awful thing to waste
And that's a fact that you must come to face
What more can I tell you?

And where, is your sense of reason?
So how, could you fool me so long?
And now, watch my tenderness turn to emptiness

It doesn't matter much to you
It doesn't matter what I do
It's over now, we're through

You gad me set and ignited
But now I'm feeling so down low
Like some down-trodden hobo

When the writing is on the wall 
And if you could fall 
When your best ain't good enough 
And life's tough 

When the lad of hope and dreams 
Isn't always what it seems 
Where there's a will, there's a way 
They always say 

You may be sorry, you may be sad, you may be blue 
You think you'll never see the sun come breaking through 
You struggle morning noon and night 
And you still I can't get it right 
But where there's a will, there's a way 
Just say it every day 

Well so much for trouble, so much for heartache 
so much for pain 
You just gotta get up, you just gotta reach out 
You gotta try and try again 
You think you'll never see it through 
But what the hell you gonna do 
Where there's a will, there's a way 
You've heard 'em say 

Well I don't no nothing 'bout this world 
And all it's wrong 
I can tell you now, 
Why we all can't get along 
But after all is said and done 

We gotta keep on, keepin' on 
'Cause where there's a will, there's a way 
I don't know what to say 

Through all your sorrows 
All your dreams, and all your joys 
In times of sadness, 
In time of grief 
And even times that you enjoy 
As your life you live it through 
You know it all depends on you 

And if where there's a will, there's a way 
You better get down and pray 
From the cradle to the grave 
You better say it every day 

When the crime's above the law 
When the plane's about to fall 
When the mighty oceans roar 
When tomorrow's at your door 
Where there's a will, there's a way 
That's what they'll say",Where There's a Will,1997

I beg, you choose
You're so cool and I'm confused 
I'm me and you're you 
You're so loose and I'm uptight

Like two ships in the night in foggy weather,
Just a waitin' for fresh winds to blow.
Maybe we're losin' one another
I could be wrong I don't know 

You get the best, I get the rest 
You pass the test, I'm just a mess 
You got it made, I'm in the shade

Like two dopes in the boat, without a paddle 
Just a wonderin' why it don't go

I've been such a patient man 
But I still don't understand 
You won't

Give me a chance to show how much I care 
How I care

Oh, it's peculiar, she used to be so nice

When lonely days turn to lonely nights

Forever playing to the gallery

Ooh, take it, take it out 
Take it, take it out
Oh yeah

Does it feel that your life's become a catastrophe?
Oh, it has to be for you to grow, boy
When you look through the years and see what you could have been
Oh, what you might have been,
If you'd had more time

So, when the day comes to settle down,
Who's to blame if you're not around?

Supertramp,"When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees, well they'd be singing so happily
Oh joyfully, playfully watching me
But then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible
Logical, oh responsible, practical
And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable
Oh clinical, oh intellectual, cynical

There are times when all the world's asleep
The questions run too deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned
I know it sounds absurd
Please tell me who I am

I said, watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical
Liberal, oh fanatical, criminal
Won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you're Acceptable
Respectable, oh presentable, a vegetable!
Oh, take it take it yeah

But at night, when all the world's asleep
The questions run so deep

Fresh outta school, picked on 'cause I'm bilingual
I barely spoke English but the gun language was universal

He said, you have problems, here's a feezy from Israel
Ran back outside, just before I could say another homicide
Threw the biscuit in the bushes runnin' like Jesse Owens
Police showed up, but I was nowhere in existence
Back in the crib thinkin' bout what I just did
I'ma police of defense but I'm bound to catch this bid
My hypothesis was right, they knocked the door, homie
Like a super in the projects wantin' rent money
Just when I thought I get my life straight in the states
Is when I found myself climbin down the fire escape
Bodies found in Virginia under the dumpsters, no
18 shell cases in front of the grocery sto'
Flee the scene of the crime before y'all kick the door
No your honor that must be some old rhyme that I wrote
And lyrics sometime man they misinterpretate it
For example when I say gun I mean my pen and paper
And every time I wave and spit the crowd jump

Je suis aussi fier de faire partie de la clique

Je veux que ça swingue hardcore, si possible

Un coup de fouet monumental
Deux cas de figure, bien sûr, le bien le mal
Certains critiquent, d'autres plus malins prennent nos techniques
Même Mick Jagger a fait un hit avec un funky beat
Alors qui conteste et qui change de bord ?
A l'heure où des rock-stars évitent la mise à mort
Grâce notamment à l'apport do sampler dès lors

Et me prient de me mettre sur le coté afin de me soumettre

C'est mal barré pour que je reste planté là
C'est mal barré, faut que je me décide et fasse mon choix
Temps de réaction, très net, c'est net
J'ai plus qu'une seule idée en tête, faut que je la serre!
Avant que cela ne me manque, il faut qu'on fasse la paire
Mais il faut que je tempère mon excitation
Oh, mais, car j'ai déjà la fièvre à la vue de ce canon
Donc sous hypnose, trop contemplatif, je n'ose
Non, non, non, laissez-moi un peu de temps, c'est pas le bon moment!
Je sais, j'ai pas la journée mais je peux prendre tout mon temps
Tant il lui plaît que je lui fasse du rentre-dedans

Don't tout devait se faire, naïf, novice, mais tellement fier

À ranger ce putain d'orgueil qui tranchait les liens familiaux
Chaque jour un peu plus
J'avais pas l'impression d'être plus coté qu'une caisse à l'argus
Donc j'ai dû renoncer, trouver mes propres complices
Mes partenaires de glisse, désolé si je m'immisce

Mais laisse pas traîner ton fils
Si tu ne veux pas qu'il glisse
Qu'il te ramène du vice
Laisse pas traîner ton fils
Si tu veux pas qu'il glisse

Que voulais-tu que ton fils apprenne dans la rue?
Quelles vertus croyais-tu qu'on y enseigne?
Mais t'as pas vu comment ça pue dehors
Mais comment ça sent la mort?
Quand tu respires ça, mec, t'es comme mort-né
Tu finis borné à force de tourner en rond
Ton cerveau te fait défaut, puis fait des bonds
Et c'est vraiment pas bon quand t'en perds le contrôle
Quand pour les yeux des autres, tu joues de mieux en mieux ton rôle
Ton rôle de caillera, juste pour ne pas
Qu'on te dise, ""Voilà tu fais plus partie de la mifa d'en bas""
C'est dingue mais c'est comme ça
Sache qu'ici-bas, plus qu'ailleurs, la survie est un combat
À base de coups bas, de coups de tonba
D'esquives, des ""shta-pow!"" de putains de stonba
Laisse pas traîner ton fils
Si tu veux pas qu'il glisse
Qu'il te ramène du vice
Non laisse pas traîner ton fils

Laisse pas traîner ton fils

Et d'ailleurs c'est normal les gens n'ont pris que du macadam dans la tronche
Attachant plus d'importance à leurs petites bronches

A part fumer des spliffs, mon premier kiff, c'est de chiller,
Rester tranquille au sein des miens, me laisser aller à déballer des conneries,
Parler juste pour parler, refaire le monde avec notre vision décalée.
On est des fous bloqués dans des cages d'escaliers.
Pris en otage par le nombre élevé de paliers, et à la longue, mec,
J't'assure, tout ça, ça pèse.
96, je vois toujours des braises allumées 
Dans les yeux fatigués des gosses du quartier.
Passe passe le mic
Que je développe mes idées contaminées, c'est vrai j'suis miné mais déterminé
A ne jamais vraiment lâcher l'affaire, qu'est-ce que je peux faire ?
J'suis pas là pour prendre des coups, ou bien même pour me taire.
Si le FN brandit sa flamme, j'suis là pour l'éteindre, c'est clair !
Pas d'éclair de génie, juste un lyrics qui jaillit
De mon esprit, dédicacé à mon posse.

I make music for my people
'Cause that's my people
I make music for my people
'Cause that's my people
I make music for my people
'Cause that's my people
I make music for my people
'Cause that's my people

Construire est ma seule excuse au fait de prendre de l'âge.
Si j'sens pas les miens autour de moi, putain, c'est le naufrage
Assuré, c'est vrai ! 
J'me sens rassuré, qu'en présence de ceux que j'aime,
Je veux m'assurer que tout c'que j'balance soit approuvé
Même si j'ai rien à prouver, Je veux que tous mes potes puissent s'y retrouver
Je veux pouvoir les garder près de moi, les regarder 12 mois par an,
Comme l'ont fait mes parents pour moi,Parce qu'après c'est trop tard
Faut pas comprendre qu'on les aimait, une fois qu'ils sont tis-par
Ou bien, c'est qu't'as envie de pleurer, ou plutôt que tu sais pas !
Dans ce cas, j'peux rien pour toi, j'ai pas la clé du bonheur,
J'ai même jamais été à la hauteur, pour ce genre de truc,
Mais aujourd'hui j'ai peur car l'horloge a tourné",That's My People,1998
Suprême NTM,"Check it uhh 
Protect this nigga for the necklace 
I throw the death wish  the pretty slim sex shit 
The rep this remember Fox said this 
We on some next shit we are blessed this 
The scares on our backs mean we met this 
The lie for them for 25 sentence 
To keep my eyes on 'em I straight knowin' when the light shine on 'em 
Shitty drugs and drama oppposite three pretty thugs and a don momma 
Fillin' the rest, the steel in they chest 
And Boogs threw the kiss of death, it was over 
And we laid out, chill I was open off the way he ate out 
It was real, for real I was fuckin' wit' mills and he was frag-ile 
We wowin', the brown stallion 
Stay stylin', on the low foulin' 
The whole Firm woulin', we lucked it 
I know the trick bitch he fuck with, on some duct shit 
Heard through the grade that she sucked it, Firm Sos and Esco 
Mad loco, Fox and Mega for whatever and through this chedda 
We gon' stay family, till we fry though 
The fam will never split even if one of us die though 
Along with our get go's, we gon' blaze til it brick-o's 
Peep the na na, sweet taboo 
The Firm tattoo on the tha tha, now tell me what crew 
Hold it down like we do da da 
Verse Two: Az the Vizuiliza 
Till the death of this, murderous moves pursue effortless 
Ice neckalce, high priced dressed executives 
Peep the grammer, flim built strong stamina 
Forty-four nickel plate long with the silencer 
Play for keeps in shut eye you stay sleep shit 
Remain deep in ???? thrown at ya veins jeeps 
Juiliani suite got all the kings goin' up for creek 
 Devil like biz now, who left his twirl in the streets 
 No intelligence, stritcly slow niggaz minds with ???? 
 It's evident, Feds mess up paid ya residents 
 We all for livin', heavyweight Firm division 
 Mine, I check mine ?Iaswines? is my religion 
 You know the stees, take aim, cock and squeeze 
 It's the prophecies, got the philosciphies Socrates 
 Next up 
 Verse Three: Cormega 
 Yo I believe that's me (yo Mega represent for the family) 
 Aye yo, the Feds fot me in the top ten, 'cause when my door got knocked in 
 A four four man's hoped in, my sinister mind 
 Shines like a Dilinger, Mega exhaulted Babyface crime emperor 
 Yo life is based on cultures and creeds, and feed the way 
 Be the thug nigga sess, I've seen niggaz tied up 
 Handcuffed and ????, cold crisis is live when drugs supply driver 
 The millennium drives up, rimes and my blinds ya eyes temporarily 
 Nas and Mega be heavily armed for felony, John you could never see 
 The next fat cat of NYC, It Was Written like ghetto life heirogriphics 
 Livin' since my real niggaz bailed me out of prision, a lot of scams 
 Cause the narcotics beamin', Queens had marked dollars 
 And the knowledge of thieves, my dream is the legacy 
 Of my penetentary, fake thugs couldn't even take gloves to burry me 
 Verse Four: Nas Escobar 
 To all theroughbreds takin' the corners, ya'll need to join us 
 Firm most powerful nation of rap performers, high class generals 
 Confidence, payin' lawyers 
 Swift as Oscar Delaholia, green berett warriors 
 Fakes I keep them like the John Kennedy tape, in the new with two 
 Bustin' all in they face, I'm never worried cause your see through 
 My man built the Sugar Hill from sweet tooth, we all eat 
 Cause we I speak truth, uneducated black youth 
 Street diploma, teach Greeks and Romans but the legacy was stollen 
 It's a Firm thing, generally green I wrote the theme 
 On how to sell a million while ya cats are mad at ya promotion team 
 I roll with the nice as Fox, black ice pushin' whips without a license 
 Yeah, tight as five strokes, Nas got 19 wifies 
 Seven sheisty, nine of them Piceses 
 Three white meats under tight cheese, woulin' 
 Big links is heavy like bricks, used to want a pitbull 
 While feedin' them raw steak, it's core take 
 More cake, I take the time off the so-called king of the town 
 And lock it down",Affirmative Action Remix,2007
Suprême NTM,"Tout a débuté un matin quand à dix heures dix
Je fus tiré du lit par l'emmerdeur de service
Mon voisin du dessus, en bon fan d'Elvis
Passe ses weekends à foutre à fond de lives de Memphis
Le pire, c'est que je n'ai quasiment pas dormi de la nuit
Sache qu'hier au soir, je suis sorti, mec
Jusqu'à six heures du mat
Tu peux comprendre ça?
Ça ne me fait pas plus de quatre heures de sommeil, exact!
Je vais encore passer la journée la tête dans les vapes, en plus
J'ai des rendez-vous importants, des interviews
Ça risque d'être chaud, je suis de mauvaise humeur je l'avoue mais j'assume
Je contrôle d'ailleurs
Je suis déjà au volant de ma caisse direction les Abbesses où
J'ai rendez-vous avec
L'homme que l'on nomme Joey, Joey Starr mais j'ai pas fait 500 mètres
Que les keufs m'arrêtent
Et me prient de me mettre sur le coté afin de me soumettre
À un contrôle d'identité, simple formalité
Quand on a ses papiers mais voilà, là
Je les avais pas sur moi
J'ai donc été invité au commissariat, où là
Ils m'ont mis la fièvre

Marre de faire la borne kilométrique comme trop souvent
Le revoyant, me précisant, en insistant
Qu'il me faut arriver dans les temps pour un truc important
Quand apparaît devant moi une bitch
C'est mal barré pour que je reste planté là
C'est mal barré, faut que je me décide et fasse mon choix
Temps de réaction, très net, c'est net
J'ai plus qu'une seule idée en tête, faut que je la serre!
Avant que cela ne me manque, il faut qu'on fasse la paire
Mais il faut que je tempère mon excitation
Oh, mais, car j'ai déjà la fièvre à la vue de ce canon
Donc sous hypnose, trop contemplatif, je n'ose
Non, non, non, laissez-moi un peu de temps, c'est pas le bon moment!
Je sais, j'ai pas la journée mais je peux prendre tout mon temps
Tant il lui plaît que je lui fasse du rentre-dedans
Cette femme qui s'ondule, moi ça j'aime, tant pis pour Kool Shen
Je la lâche pas, non, j'enchaîne, comme se le doit l'orfèvre
Jamais, jamais d'un coup deux lièvres
Alors, pendant des heures

Pendant des heures, mais elle m'a mis la fièvre
Pendant des heures, mais elle m'a mis la fièvre
Pendant des heures, mais elle m'a mis la fièvre
Pendant des heures, mais elle

Oh, mais ils m'ont mis la fièvre, pendant des heures
Je suis resté assis sur un banc, contre le radiateur
J'avais pourtant des choses à faire
J'avais beau leur répéter, mais y'avait rien à faire
C'était définitivement pas mon jour
Déjà le rock au réveil, j'étais pas vraiment pour
Y'a des jours comme ça où tout ne va pas pour le mieux
Y'a des jours où tout part en couille, tout coule

Parle pour toi, neshè, car pour moi ce fut terrible
J'ai passé la journée avec une meuf terrible!
Une biatch de magazine
Beaucoup plus bonne que la plus bonne de tes copines!
Donc, je te laisse imaginer la suite
Je te fais pas de dessin, ça risque d'être censuré dans le clip
Mais bon, il n'y eut pas de répit, pas de trêve
Pendant des heures et des heures

Je lui ai mis la fièvre pendant des heures

This is what it's all about
Time to take Affirmative Action son
They just don't understand, you kna'mean
Niggas coming sideways thinking stuff is sweet man
Niggas don't understand the four devils; lust, envy, hate, jealousy
Wicked niggas, man

Yo sit back, relax, catch ya contact, sip your cog-ni-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat
Sneak attack a new cat sit back, worth top dollar
In fact touch mine's and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate, we play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch em and break, undress em, tie em with tape no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it homicide cases get blown
Aristocrats, politickin daily with diplomats
See me I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche, my destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a key of her-oin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
And Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina they will see you
When you re-up bring your heater all your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam, made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turning niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus, Mega the pretty boy
With mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it

Yo, my mind is seeing through your design like blind fury
I shine jewelry sipping on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickening, he just finished bidding upstate
And now the projects is talking that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars meeting Foxy at the Mosque
Moving cars, your top papi Señor Escobar

In the black Camaro
Firm deep, all my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multimillions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Moet Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two, they ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shitting hard like Czar: Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm baby, from BK to the Bridge
My nigga Wiz, operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin Crist-ies

We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The Gods they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke, raw though
An ounce mixed with leak that's pure though
Flipping the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar
Was mad dripper
He had a fucking villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama but wait it's half-and-half
Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half
Get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen now add the other two that Mega bringing through
So let's see, if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki

I close my eyes imagining the moment that my dreams are gonna come true.
The way you wear your hair, the shyness underneath your smile,

I rushed right in before but right now I'm gonna take my time,

Sure Conviction,"Standing on my porch
In the middle of the night
I see a rainbow shining so bright
Colors red to blue lighting up the sky

I see a rainbow shining so bright
Horses dancing on the rainbow one by one
Following the star the Chosen One
A bright light flashing for all the world to see

In an instant He's gone to eternity
In an instant He's gone to eternity
Colors red to blue lighting up the sky
I see a rainbow shining so bright

He's coming back

And see if we're ready",The Dream,1995
Sure Conviction,"I just got off the phone today
With a good friend of mine
She mentioned something bout her family
And having a real good time

Wouldn't it be great to see them
Wouldn't it be great to be with them
But I had my own plans for this is my life
I thought about all the words

That were shared between the two of us
For a moment I paused then I realized
If she gives into me, it would be great for my reason
Instead I could sacrifice, just a little bit of my time

If there's one thing that I've learned over the years
Without sacrifice - there isn't love
If a side of me just won't give in
And I'd rather be on my own

Than I'd never grow, I'd never know
Sacrifice - Sacrifice
I heard somebody say, to get love
You gotta give it away

And I felt something tugging at my heart that day
I knew I should pick up the phone
And tell her that I'd go along
When I did, she thanked me, now I wrote this song...

I once read about a man
Who gave of himself to the very end
He sacrificed His life for you and me
I want to learn to be like Him

And give love instead of taking it in
For it's better to give than to receive
I still believe, in sacrifice",Sacrifice,1997

We regulate any stealing of his property

But you can't be any geek off the street,
Gotta be handy with the steel if you know what I mean, earn your keep!
Regulators! Mount up!

[Warren G]
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

[Nate Dogg]
Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

[Warren G]
So I hooks a left on the 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice so I said ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats so I said ""I'm stuck.""

[Nate Dogg]
Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Won't'cha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

[Warren G]
I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brother said ""Damn, what's next?""

[Nate Dogg]
They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

[Warren G]
They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I could fly
Let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

[Nate Dogg]
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin' 
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

[Warren G]
Now Nate got the freaks
And that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up cause it's on
N A T E and me
The Warren to the G

[Nate Dogg]
Just like I thought 
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""oh I like your size.""
She said ""my car's broke down and you seem real nice,
Would ya let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

Boy, that thing was dumb

Can someone tell me why that lifeguard's swimming out ?

Forgot that I was broke
Can I borrow a dollar?

Doesn't someone out there have some coin?

There's a spot right there

Why does this always happen?

Hey, it's gonna be a hot one today
85 in town, 95 in the Valley
I suggest you all pile in the old jalopies
And get on out to that beach

It's gonna be a cool

Working and slaving and standing in line
Or deadling with the inland geeks

I was born to surf
I gotta find out what life is really worth

I was born to ride the waves
And not feel like I was someone's slave

Ride the waves and leave the city behind

Nothing can stop it cause you've just gotta ride ride ride ride ride

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds,2010

Will I find sanctuary within your arms

Someday when I even the score 
You'll reach and you'll find me near you 
Right beside you, forevermore

So safely unaware we might be in to deep
I hide my feelings behind these shades

A cold Corona and a twist of lime,
Cools me down when I'm alone

I never wanted any woman more,
I look at the door and she reads my mind.

Throw back the sheets,

Still burning in the after-glow,
Sun peekin' through mirrored glasses.
A little groggy from the night before.
Feeling wild as the day advances
Can't seem to keep my mind off you.
It's just no use , It's blind desire.

Time be my friend

Ayayay, perdí toda esperanza,
Allá a Dios, solo llegan mis quejas.

Te hablo desde aquí, Miguel Infante……….. Que va alla

Condenado para siempre, en esta horrible celda,
Donde no llega el cariño, ni la voz de nadie,
Así me paso los días, y la noche entera,
Solo vivo del recuerdo, eterno de mi madre.

Ayayay, solo espero que llegue,
Ayayay, el día que la muerte,
Ayayay, me lleve a estar con ella,
Ahí al fin, ahí cambiara mi suerte.

Es fuerte el lamento de los de Villanueva…. Como……. Y vuelve otra vez

Hay que solo estoy solo me espera la muerte,
Hay que solo estoy, cuando cambiara mi suerte,
Oh que triste soledad, vivir en esta condena,
Ya no quiero sufrir más, te lo digo Magdalena, eeeena
Hay que solo estoy solo me espera la muerte,
Hay que solo estoy, cuando cambiara mi suerte,
Compañeros de prisión, gente de todas las clases,
Que no tienen corazón, y no saben lo que hacen.

Solo con mi pena, solo en mi condena.Bis

Oye Fruco, solo voy con mi pena, en esta celda, 30 años de condena, ay.......ayayay",El  Preso,2001

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!

Susan Aglukark,"Heart in a bottle
High on a shelf
Fragile, but just out of reach
Cause you build a fortress
With the distance you keep
But when your heart aches
Doesn't it cut deep?

You don't have to suffer
Suffer in silence
You don't have to suffer
Suffer in silence

Don't you know that your
Heart can feel like an anchor
When you keep it all inside
No no, don't suffer in silence

Withered in sadness
And hurting inside
But feeling afraid to impose
So you're an island
But you don't have to be
Cause if you're inclined
You can talk to me

But you don't have to suffer
Suffer in silence
You don't have to suffer
Suffer in silence
Oh I know that the pain can seem like an ocean
But I'm just a word away
No no, don't suffer in silence

I'll be your shelter, I'll be your retreat
I'll be your shield against the wind
So, if you need a shoulder for the tears that you keep
Let em come down
Let it rain on me

Cause you don't have to suffer
Suffer in silence
You should never have to suffer
Suffer in silence
Oh, I will hear when you're calling
Like a voice above the storm
No no, don't suffer in silence

You don't have to suffer
Suffer in silence
You don't have to suffer
Suffer in silence
Don't you know that your
Heart can feel like an anchor
When you keep it all inside
No no, don't suffer in silence

But that doesn't mean they've fallen from grace
But in her landscape, their heartache is so out of place

Can we talk of cabbages and kings?

But vengeance was theirs as they bellowed for justice

Pointing the finger from up on my throne 
'Til I looked in his tears and I caught my reflection 
And I knew that I could not cast the first stone.

To the better angels of our nature, to the better angels of our nature.

She walked the alleys of anguish and need 
While clutching my greed I was struck by a vision 
But for the grace of God, that could be me. 

And we gather in chambers of lofty ideals 
Still debating the giving when handed the bill 
But in the congress of kindness I hope that we can yield 
To the better angels of our nature, to the better angels of our nature. 

Angels of mercy, angels of light 
Angels of darkness, angels of might 
Angels with voices that whisper so clear 
Who do I lean to, who do I hear? 

We are building our world with a fevered emotion 
While trying to keep it from coming apart 
But as we reach for the dream can we still reach within us 
We won't have the hope if we don't have the heart. 

'Cause we've tossed in the gale of a moral decline 
As we drink from the grail of society's wine 
But at humanities table I hope we choose to dine

Your mountains of dreams, seems harder to climb
By those who have made you feel like an outcast
Cause you dare to be different, so they're drawing a line

They say you're a fool, they feed you resistance
They tell you you'll never go very far
But they'll be the same ones that stand in the distance
Alone in the shadow of your shining star

Just keep on the same road and keep on your toes
And just keep your heart steady as she goes
And let them call you what they will
It don't matter, a rose by any name is still a rose

The kindness of strangers, it seems like a fable
But they've yet to see what I see in you
But you can make it if you are able
To believe in yourself the way I do

Just keep on the same road and keep on your toes
And just keep your heart steady as she goes
And let them call you what they will
It don't matter, a rose by any name is still a rose

'Cause a deal is a deal in the heart of the dream
And a spade is a spade, if you know what I mean
And a rose is a rose is a rose

To deal with the scoffers it's part of the bargain
They heckle from back rows and they bark at the moon
Their flowers are fading in time's bitter garden
But yours is only beginning to bloom

So keep on that same road and keep on your toes
Just keep your heart steady as she goes
And let them call you what they will
Just remember, a rose by any name is still a rose
A rose by any name is still a rose

Susan Ashton,"The touch of your hand will let me know
You take me in and let me go
If not for love why would we meet
How is it done two into one so easily

We're lifted up by angels
Higher than the world
Strong enough to leave it
Bound to learn the secrets
Angels never heard
Close enough to heaven
Above the rain
Darkness cannot reach us
Let the angels teach us
Only love remains
We're lifted up by angels

You understand yet never say
How every plan would fade away
If not for love where would you be
Ashes to dust water to rust away from me

Higher than the world
Strong enough to leave it
Bound to learn the secrets
Angels never heard
Close enough to heaven

Only love remains
We're lifted up by angels

We're lifted up by angels
Given wings to fly
Leave the night behind us
Trust the light to find us

Susan Ashton,"In the deep of the dark, you fell in as the heart
Of your world went down in flames
To a cauldron of pain, seeing no way out

And as you walked through the fire
Losing even desire it was like a dying swan
To look at you then but look at you now

You have found a new lease on life
A stronger step and a curious calm on your face
That you wear as if to say

You can rise from the ashes again
You can rise to the morning that breaks in your eyes
For what looked like your heart's demise
Has turned out to be a blessing in disguise

It has worked for the good, like you heard that it could
But it was hard, so hard to believe
Standing among the ruins of a dream

But from here looking back, you can see clearly that
You can gain from things that you lose
And learn many ways by many means

You have been an inspiration to me
And all the volumes of hope your revival can speak
Will always say to me

You can rise from the ashes again
You can rise to the morning that breaks in your eyes
For what looked like your heart's demise
Has turned out to be a blessing in disguise

You can rise from the ashes again
You can rise to the morning that breaks in your eyes
For what looked like your heart's demise
Has turned out to be a blessing in disguise
It's turned out to be a blessing in disguise",Blessing in Disguise,1994
Susan Ashton,"I've got a witness not too stable
It wouldn't get me very far
I've got one hand on the table
And one in the cookie jar
I've got sins that need eviction
From a temple that's a wreck
I've got a chain of contradiction
Hanging around my neck
So I go down, I go down, down
I go down on my knees

I feel the bitter winds grow colder
They are dancing with my pride
I've got a chip on my shoulder
Bigger than a mountainside
And these claws of human nature
Hold me tight within their clasp
I'm not worthy of forgiveness
But I just had to ask
So I go down, I go down, down
I go down on my knees

(Chorus)
Feed my hunger – slake my thirst
For a spiritual rebirth
Light my darkness
Move in me
Make me more than what you see
As I go down on my knees

When I've all but killed the fire
And my soul's in desperate need
But I wallow in the mire of complacency
That's when I go down on my knees
I want to taste the fruit I'm missing
And yet I feast only on the bread
My desire's alive and kicking
But my drive is dead
So I go down on my knees

(Chorus)

You bear the weight of condemnation
Cleansing with the blood of truth
So with my humble acclamation
I want to give myself to you 
So I go down, I go down, down
I go down on my knees
I go down, I go down, yea
I go down on my knees
I go down, I go down, down
I go down on my knees",Down on My Knees,1994

'Cause we are comfortable here in our slumber

Susan Ashton,"Where there is love there is a peace 
And in the cages that bind the bitter heart it is release 
Hold it close to your chest, let it move and let it rest 
For it is here to set your mind at ease 
Where there is love there is a peace. 

Where there is hope there is a dream 
To rise above, to remit and to redeem 
To go back, to go where there's no hurt or anger there 
To find the song that you once could sing 
Where there is hope there is a dream. 

Where there is faith there is a chance 
To alter the course and fight the winds of circumstance 
Not to scar, but mend, not to break, but to bend 
And not to know but to understand 
Where there is faith there is a chance 
Where there is hope there is a dream. 

Where there is love there is a peace...

Susan Ashton,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

Or was it something from my past, come to call again?
It was the presence of the pain that I could not escape
And it wrapped around my soul like a ball and chain

All of us have a heartache, all of us have been stained
All of us long for freedom, but there's only one who can break

It was the presence of the peace that I could not escape
And it wrapped around my soul like a warm embrace

I stand tall, healing as His tears wash my lonely years

Susan Ashton,"With visible breath, I'm calling your name
With visible tracks, I'm finding my way
With a sorrowful heart, I honor this pain
And offer these tears to the rain

In a moment of truth at the top of the hill
I open my arms and let go of my will

And stand with my face to the wind
With the storm beating down on this sacred ground
If I stand for the grace that I've known for what I believe
Then I won't stand alone, no I won't stand alone

There's a new pair of eyes to embrace all I see
A new peace of mind and it comes quietly
There's a joy in my heart that you've given to me
And I offer this soul's melody

So I beat on my chest till my song has been sung
And I cry like a wolf at the top of my lungs

And stand with my face to the wind
With the storm beating down on this sacred ground
If I stand for the grace that I've known for what I believe
Then I won't stand alone, no I won't stand alone

When the thundering voices of doubt try to shake my faith, oh
I'll be listening from inside out and I won't be afraid to

Stand with my face to the wind

Susan Ashton,"I said I'd never let that hungry wolf come
Blow this house down
But I left myself unguarded
I said I'd never let the tempter of my heart
Come back around
But now look at what I've started

I've unlocked a box of confusion
I've lost all my reason

Clear to the left, clear to the right
Without a sound it came around
Hit me on the blind side
Look to the front, look to the back
Down for the count, I'll tell you how
Hit me on the blind side

And though I could see
The truth staring right at me
Well, I did not ready myself
For the blind side, hey, yeah, yeah

So I went walking through
The garden of temptation unaware
And I tasted what I wanted
Not looking for the subtle warnings
That might be hidden there
And I barreled through undaunted

Oh, I was soon seduced by a craving
That left me defenseless

Susan Ashton,"Once I was lost
Hurting inside
Dangling over the edge
But the history of pain
Barely remains
Once I was blind
But could it be
That the excess of light
Is shading the weary past
With the shadow it cast
And as sin gives way
To atoning blood
And a debt is paid
With the riches of love
There's a hope that I see
There's a freedom in me
There's a comfort in death and in life
Knowing that I belong
To the Savior who's making me whole
Body and soul
Now, I can feel
A sense of resolve
Choosing a new point of view
Going against the grain
Breaking the chain
And the shackles fall
On the road to peace
And I lose them all
As I find my release
(And that) Hope eternal springs in me
(And that) Freedom seems to willingly carry me
Through a world of fears I've stored inside of me

Chilled to the bone
Hundreds of faces in sight
Still I'm alone
Door after door
Room after empty room

But under a different moon

In the longest days, in the darkest night
Down the longest road, there's a presence of light
But I hear a voice that calls me
It's love's name I'll call in the end

I've walk in and out of the fire
Between truth and lies
Now how many children watch
While one child cries
Tear down these walls

Be back in Boston By the break of day

Heaven knows I will go, I will follow

Or is it something that you're running from
Is it hope that keeps you going
Is it faith that makes you strong

Your restless nature keeps you raging on

Shallow waters, tangent streams

We can drive all night it'll be all right
Love can take us so far on my getaway car

All we need is the open road and more fuel for the fire inside us
Steer us on into lands unknown we can leave this world behind
And all I know is you and me that's all we'll need to start all over again

We can runaway baby come as you are...

Turn up the radio and don't look back again
Let me put the pedal down get us outta this town
Don't be afraid to ride

Susan Boyle,"This is the moment; this is the day 
When I send all my doubts and demons on their way. 
Every endeavor I have made ever 
Is coming into play, is here and now today.

This is the moment, this is the time 
When the momentum and the moment are in rhyme 
Give me this moment, this momentous moment;
I'll gather up my past, and make some sense at last. 

This is the moment, when all I've done 
All of the dreaming, scheming and screaming become one. 
This is the day, just see it shine
When all I've lived for becomes mine. 

This is the moment, this is the hour
When I can open tomorrow like a flower.
And with my hand to, everything I've planned to
Fulfill my grand design; see all my stars align;

This is the moment, my final test; 
Destiny beckoned, I never reckoned second best. 
I won't look down, I must not fall; 
This is the moment, the sweetest moment of them all. 

This is the moment, forget all the odds 
This day or never I'll sit forever with the gods. 
When I look back I will recall, moment for moment
This was the moment,
The greatest moment of them all.",This Is the Moment,2012
Susan Boyle,"I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through

Now it's history

I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's a destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence

Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear

The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain.

Tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?

Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say
Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always stay in love

The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand

I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow
In the bleak midwinter, long ago

Our God, heaven cannot hold him, nor earth sustain
Heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ

Enough for Him, whom cherubim, worship night and day
A breast full of milk, and a mangerful of hay
Enough for Him, whom angels fall down before

If I were a wise man, I would do my part
Yet what can I give Him give my heart",In the Bleak Midwinter,2013

A tiny star lights up way up high

And loving me tonight

Somewhere out there
Someone's saying a prayer
That we'll find one another
In that big somewhere out there

It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky

Then we'll be together

Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!

Now it's no wonder that her name means Beauty
Her looks have got no parallel

But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very different from the rest of us

She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle!

Look at her, LeFou
My future wife
Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village
That's makes her the best

But she's so well-read
And you're so athletically-inclined

Yes, ever since the war, I felt like I've been missing something
She's the only girl that ever given me that sense of

Mmm je ne sais quoi?

I don't know what that means

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute!
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!

Bonjour, pardon
Good day, mais oui!
You call this bacon, what lovely flowers
Some cheese, ten yards, one pound,  excuse me I'll get the knife
Please let me through!
This bread, those fish, it's stale, they smell!
Madame's mistaken Well, maybe so

There must be more than this provincial life!

Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!

Look there she goes the girl is strange, but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle!

It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in

'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl

Susan Egan,"Yes, I made the choice
For Papa I will to stay
But I don't deserve to lose my freedom in this way
You monster!

If you think that what you've done is right
Well then, your a fool
Think again

Is this home?
Is this where I should learn to be happy?
Never dreamed
That a home could be
Dark and cold I was told
Every day in my childhood
Even as we grow old
Home should be where the heart is
Never were words so true
My hearts far, far away
Home is to.

Is this home?
Is this what I must learn to believe in?
Try to find something good
In this tragic place
Just in case
I should stay here forever
Held in this empty space
Oh but that won't be easy
I know the reason why
My hearts far, far away
Homes a lie
What I'd give
To return
To the life that I knew lately
And to think I complained of that dull,and provincial town

Is this home?
Am I here for a day or forever?
Shut away from the home until
Who knows when
Oh but then
If my life has been altered once it can change again
Build higher walls around me
Change every lock and key
Nothing lasts nothing holds all of me
My hearts far, far away

No matter what they do

Susan Egan,"When I was a girl, I had a favourite story
Of the meadowlark who lived where the rivers wind
Her voice could match the angels' in its glory,
But she was blind,
The lark was blind.

the king of the rivers took her to his palace,
Where the walls were burnished bronze and golden braid,
And he fed her fruit and nuts from an ivory chalice and he prayed


""Sing for me, my meadowlark
Sing for me of the silver morning.
Set me free, my meadowlark
And I'll buy you a priceless jewel,
And cloth of brocade and crewel,
And I'll love you for life if you will
Sing for me.""


Than one day as the lark sang by the water
The god of the sun heard her in his flight
And her singing moved him so, he came and brought her
The gift of sight,
He gave her sight.
And she opened her eyes to the shimmer and the splendour
Of this beautiful young god, so proud and strong
And he called to the lark in a voice both rough and tender,
""Come along,


Fly with me, my meadowlark,
Fly with me on the silver morning.
Past the sea where the dolphins bark,
We will dance on the coral beaches,
Make a feast of the plums and peaches,
Just as far as your vision reaches,
Fly with me.""


But the meadowlark said no,
For the old king loved her so,
She couldn't bear to wound his pride.
So the sun god flew away and when the king came down that day,
He found his meadowlark had died.
Every time I heard that part I cried.


And now I stand here, starry-eyed and stormy.
Oh, just when I thought my heart was finally numb,
A beautiful young man appears before me
Singing ""Come
Oh, won't you come?""
And what can I do if finally for the first time
The one I'm burning for returns the glow?
If love has come at last it's picked the worst time
Still I know
I've got to go.


Fly away, meadowlark.
Fly away in the silver morning.
If I stay, I'll grow to curse the dark,
So it's off where the days won't bind me.
I know I leave wounds behind me,
But I won't let tomorrow find me

If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like,

When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose

When Rockefeller still can hoard en-

On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address

He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names

So late at night I'd read it anyways and that was the last time I asked for permission

living in a cage this prodigal child will always stray

Wiped the mud off my face 'cause this world belongs to the brave

Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he for me
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

In the silence of the night

Far off in the distance
A fire comes to life
A flicker of a flame breaks through the dark
Burning soft and bright
Dancing with the light
Awakening the Heavens and the Earth

Far across the ocean
A flame is rising high
Breaking through the shadows and the dark
Shining in the night
Rising with the light
Here to wake the Heavens and the Earth

Now as the light starts to rise
Now as the day opens wide
Now as the dreams slips away
You wake to the day
You wake to the light

Here as your dream falls away
Feel as the dark turns to day
Leave the shadows behind
And the dream called in blind
Turn into the light

Far off in the distance
A fire comes to life
A flicker of a flame breaks through the dark
Burning soft and bright
Dancing with the light

Susan McFadden,"Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.

But when he come, and all the flowers are dying
If I am dead, as dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an ""Ave"" there for me.

And I shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me
And all my grave will warm and sweeter be
For you will bend and tell me that you love me
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me.",Danny Boy,2014

(He had it coming)
My sister, Veronica and I had this double act
And my husband, Charlie, traveled round with us.
Now, for the last number in our act, 
We did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row
One, two, three, four, five, splits, spread eagles,
Back flips, flip flops,
One right after the other.
So this one night before the show we are down at the Hotel Cicero,
The three of us, boozin' 
Havin' a few laughs
And we run out of ice
So I go out to get some
I come back, open the door
And there's Veronica and Charlie 
Doing Number Seventeen
The spread eagle
Well, I was in such a state of shock, 
I completely blacked out, I can't remember a thing 
It wasn't until later, 
When I was washing the blood off my hands
I even knew they were dead

They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming all along
I didn't do it
But if I'd done it
How could you tell me that I was wrong?

They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming all along (they took a flower in its prime)
I didn't do it (and then they used it)
But if I'd done it
How could you tell me 
That I was wrong?

I loved Al Lipschitz
More than I can possibly say.
He was a real artistic guy...
Sensitive... A painter.
But he was always trying to find himself.
He'd go out every night looking for himself
And on the way
He found Ruth,
Gladys,
Rosemary and Irving
I guess you could say we broke up
Because of artistic differences.
He saw himself as alive
And I saw him dead.

The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum

They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming all along
'Cause if they used us ('cause if they used us)
And they abused us (and they abused us)

How could you tell us that we were wrong?

He had it coming (he had it coming)
He had it coming (he had it coming)
He only had himself to blame (he only had himself to blame)
If you'd have been there (if you'd have been there)
If you'd have seen it (if you'd have seen it)
I betcha you would have done the same!

Susan Sarandon,"In the velvet darkness,
Of the blackest night,
Burning bright,
There's a guiding star
No matter what or who you are

There's a light

(Over at the Frankenstein place)

There's a light

(Burning in the fireplace)

There's a light, light, in the darkness of everybody's life

The darkness must go down the river of night's dreaming
Flow morphia slow, let the sun and light come streaming
Into my life Into my life
Into my life Into my life

There's a light

(Over at the Frankenstein place)

There's a light

(Burning in the fireplace)
(There's a light, a light)

In the darkness of everybody's life",Over at the Frankenstein Place,2000
Susan Shore,"It was the third heat pick 'em up, lay em down, let it go boys
Everyone was drinking up the beer and the sound of the hi-pro noise
Out of the corner like a dirty, dirty word
Came crazy bobby runnin' naked as a bird
Naked as a baby on his birthing hour
With his butt on the vinyl and all that horsepower

[Chorus]
And all you could see was a big ball of dust
And old number 6, big money or bust
Everybody wondered what he had under the hood
The day crazy bobby ran the dirt track in the nude

All the old men and all the old women said he ruined the trip
If they'd wanted burned rubber and rubber burning they'd have gone to the drag strip
An old boy said he's taking quite a chance
Going hard into the corner and wearing no pants
Sister she cried and grandma she screamed
Annabelle's glasses got steamed

[Chorus]

The boys never been right, never been right, now he'll wind up dead
But he laughed all the way to the checkered flag and the money instead
He took a victory tour and everybody clapped
With his hands on the wheel and his helmet on his lap
The drivers said and some of them cursed
we've been beat before but this is the worst, oh my lord

[Chorus]

The day crazy bobby ran the dirt track in the nude
The day crazy bobby ran the dirt track in the nude
The day crazy bobby ran the county dirt track in the nude",The Day Crazy Bob Ran the Dirt Track in the Nude,1989
Susan Shore,"He hit me once and I fell down
Rolled into the river and I damn near drowned
I said do that again but I ran real good
Cause I knew if I stayed that he probably would

[Chorus]
My fighting days are over
My fighting days it's true
My fighting days are over
My fighting days are through

There were six of them there was one of me
I said what kind of man do you think I'll be
After twelve weeks in bed on a clear iv
I figured they had gotten the best of me

I loved the wife of a jealous man
She said she'd tell him and he'd understand
He understood so well he brought a knife and a gun
Said after I shoot you I'll skin ya for fun

I'm a lucky man I'd have to admit
When there's trouble sitting there I've stepped in it
Now I walk real quiet and I smile real wide
Hell, life's too short for suicide",Fighting Days,1989
Susan Shore,"Emmett net Ellie
Ellie eloped with Emmett
They were married in a white stone church
In the flint hills of Kansas
They passed the time
With bourbon and wine
To get the nerve to tell their folks
In the flint hills of Kansas

They had children one and two
Eyes of gold and blue
Emmett worked in a grain wayside
In the flint hills of Kansas
He bought an olds with an am radio
Things were rolling right along
In the flint hills of Kansas

[Chorus]
All in all they had it good
Life as solid as ironwood
In the flint hills of Kansas

It was 1967
The year of no decision
They were taking boys of drinking age
In the flint hills of Kansas
Emmett wore his uniform
Starched and buttoned down
The last time Ellie kissed him
In the flint hills of Kansas

[Chorus]",The Flint Hills of Kansas,1989
Susan Shore,"About the time that Daddy left to fight the big war
I saw my first pistol in the general store
In the general store, when I was thirteen
Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen

So l asked if I could have one when I grew up
Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt
Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow
Loads a mite slow and i soon found out
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out
So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45
Called a peacemaker but I never knew why
Never knew why, I didn't understand
Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
Never knew why, I didn't understand
Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

Well I get into a card game in a company town
Caught a miner cheating I shot the dog down
Shot the dog down, watched the dog fall
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw
The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
the devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand",The Devil's Right Hand,2003
Susan Shore,"Just when every ray of hope was gone
I should have known that you would come along
I can't believe I ever doubted you
My old friend the blues

Another lonely night, a nameless town
If sleep don't take me first, you'll come around
I know I can always count on you
My old friend the blues

Lovers leave and friends will let you down
But you're the only sure thing that I've found
No matter what I do, I'll never lose
My old friend the blues

Lovers leave and friends will let you down
But you're the only sure thing that I've found

Susan Silo,"What about sunrise
What about rain
What about all the things that you said
We were to gain
What about killing fields
Is there a time
What about all the things
That you said were yours and mine

Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores

Aah, ooh

What have we done to the world
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son

What about flowering fields
Is there a time
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine

Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying earth, these weeping shores

Aah, ooh
Aah, ooh

I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far

Aah, ooh
Aah, ooh

Aah, ooh
Aah, ooh

Hey, what about yesterday
(What about us)
What about the seas
(What about us)
The heavens are falling down
(What about us)
I can't even breathe
(What about us)
What about apathy
(What about us)
Drowning in the seas
(What about us)
What about the promised land
Preachin' what I believe
(What about us)
What about the holy land
(What about it)
What about the greed
(What about us)
Where did we go wrong
Someone tell me why

What about baby boy
(What about him)
What about the days
(What about us)
What about all their joy
Do we give a damn

Susan Silo,"Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
Look within your heart then ask,
Have you seen my childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
Cause I love such elementary things,
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the childhood I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me.
The painful youth I've had

Have you seen my childhood",Childhood [Theme From Free Willy 2],2008
