Nydia Caro,"Volver a los diecisiete
Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a Los Diecisiete,2012
Nydia Rojas,"Si estas pensando que sufriendo estoy 
Estas soñando, no sabes quien soy 
Soy insensible a heridas de amor 
Jamas exclamo un hay! de dolor 
Te has engañado me siento muy bien 
No te e extrañado no tengo por que 
Fuiste aventura como muchas mas 
Amor a oscuras sin felicidad 
Tal vez te quise lo mismo que tu 
cuando te fuiste volvi a ver la luz 
Otras vez! otras vez! otras vez
Vivo en paz! Vivo en paz! ah! 
No estas con migo, no estoy con tigo 
Por eso ahora mismo vivo muy en paz 

No estas con migo, no estoy con tigo 
Por eso ahora mismo vivo muy en paz 
Si estas pensando que sufriendo estoy 
Estas soñando, no sabes quien soy 
Soy insensible a heridas de amor 
Jamas exclamo un hay! de dolor

Nydia Rojas,"No vale la pena
Lo que tú me quieres
Porque es muy poquito
Eso no me llena, no me suficiente
Quiero otro tantito

No vale la pena
Tus distantes citas
Casi no te veo
La intención es buena
Nadie te lo quita
Pero más yo quiero

No vale la pena, corazón
Es amor de un rato
Si siempre yo te veo, corazón
Muy de vez en cuando

No vale la pena
Date cuenta de eso
Que lo que tú me has dado
Es una miseria, son muy pocos besos
Para un enamorado

No vale la pena, corazón
Es amor de un rato
Si siempre yo te veo, corazón
Muy de vez en cuando

No vale la pena
Date cuenta de eso
Que lo que tú me has dado
Es una miseria, son muy pocos besos
Para un enamorado

No vale la pena

NYG'z,"Yo, do the knowledge to the Master Builder the blow and the spliff 
The new millennium, Hiram Abiff 
Gotta watch what I say to you niggaz so I calm my patience 
'Cause the shit ain't really pass the statue of limitations 
The streets still holler about how strong I am 
Niggaz I hurt still holler about how wrong I am 
As a little nigger broke, thinking soda and coke 
Had me amazed how my steady hand kept in the flow 
Let it sit, cool and heart lit, hit the set cool and heartless 
In front of the store projects, as long as I made a profit 
I see you eyeing me, you fire escape diary 
Filled with pages of episodes and shying me 
Nonbeliever I hammer for hire 
Hit yo ass so hard that your coke will catch fire 
Dog the stakes are dyer, I'm no liar 
Hold the court and the street beef cause I got pride 

Same team no games, these chicks I blow brains 
Rap-a-lot soul train the corners rocking cocaine 
Got no shame 
Trying to blow these figures 
Headquarters gone he ain't left he still with us 
Not in the physical through us he live 
I can seen him with Big L, Pun, Pac and BIG 
Watching over the kid like dear shed the waist over 
And yelling Ether, Blowout and Takeover
I'm the truth; give you proof and your video shoot 
Pull them candors on you while them cameras on you 
How you love that 
Don't want to blow with Staxx 
So go ahead dumb up, make me car crumb up 
It's the Militia
Y'all niggaz don't know about I 
Got me heated, frustrated about to blow my high 
Me and Benz blazing, Rave got the gauge raising 
Sick of talking about it, niggaz ain't on my weight lift 

Whenever we stand together, down for whatever 
Divided we get at you from more angles 
Gang Starr forbid, NYG's same team no games 
Love is love fame one in the same 
Corny style, niggers act strange going against the grain 
Don't want to see us on top of our thing, we adapt to change 
Fame, fortune and material game, flow natural unrestrained 
Let me explain, niggers don't get it until you set it to flame 
Subject them to pain, make them respect 
The name, the set you rep, connects you get 
Stay ready to bang 
Steps ahead of competitors that'll test your aim 
H. Staxx shoot back splat dang your brain 
My foundation bust gats spread there's your brain 
Fuck with mine, spat not take the blame 
Play it for keeps, we came to win 

YO, I'm the Jerry Rice to this, much too nice to quit 
And just so you know, we never liked you kid 
Since you ain't wanna let niggers eat 
I'm gonna convene with my team before 
We gotta let the trigger speak 
'Cause nowadays y'all rappers are carbon 
Copies paws are sloppy, still its hard to stop me 
Especially when I connect with my man, rep for my fam 
We taking back the rest of our land 
And we don't really care if they say you are the shit 
They playing your hits 
We about to make our way in this biz 
And let's see if the gimmick last until the next season 
In a flash, take your stupid ass out, give me the next reason 
Flip for my peoples here, spit for my peoples here 
Yeah, time to get rich with my peoples here 
Cut of a snake's head, then we break bread 
Same team, no games 
You underground trying to fake dead 

Let, let, let the games begin","Same Team, No Games",2003

Nylo,"What if I was wrong and jumped to conclusions
Cause the chance of losing you was all too dangerous
So I just assume that you're doing things before you get the chance
So I can leave and feel like I've got the upper hand
Guilty and maybe I'm just scared of crumbling
Never wasn't much for that life of gambling
But you can't win if you don't play if don't you play there's no shame in this
That's caused me to spade

I said I wouldn't let you down
But it's like we've both have changed some how
You've made a disease of this town
And you act like you don't care
But you left
Your tears on the runway
You think you're running away
You're leaving all your troubles behind
But I'm not going with you this time
I don't wanna try to pretend I'm somebody else
Take me as I am or be left alone
Tears on the runway (run away)
You know that you love the chase
With your tears on the runway
This hate with us is flying south if you know what I mean
But I'm trying my best to keep you right here in my city
A wise women said I wish people weren't afraid of love
Then she packed her shit and she ran like a coward
When the thunder struck
Things aren't always picture perfect
But picture us on top cause we're worth it
So go and get your ticket and grab your sweater
I used to live for the chase
But now I know better
Your tears on the runway
You think you're running away
You're leaving all your troubles behind
But I'm not going with you this time
I don't wanna try to pretend I'm somebody else
Take me as I am or be left alone

You know that you love the chase
I love the chase
You know that I love the chase","Tears on the Runway, Pt. 2",2013
Nym,"We want to use our vote, so then, we just vote
So we vote
But we don't, we're not actually, I feel like we're not actually being heard
We're just kind of being patted on the head, and quietened, yeah absolutely

We really care about these things, that's why we're here, that's why we're getting together in force

My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair

En sus ojos se refleja el mal 
Ella embruja con su cuerpo 
Y mire sensual

Se comentan que ya muchos cayeron
Tuvieron buen final 
Y aunque ella quiere que me pierda en su juego 
Yo me voy a arriesgar

Y si tus labios son puro veneno 
Yo me quiero envenenar 
Y si tu piel me quema como el fuego

Y si tus labios son puro veneno 
Yo me quiero envenenar 
Y si tu piel me quema como el fuego

Y ya no sé que hacer, no encuentro la razón
Busco la manera y una explicación
Dañándome la mente con tu traición 
Y tu juego salvaje de mal amor

Porque trato de escaparme y no me deja
Noche de pasión y luna llena
Juraste quedarte siempre conmigo
Y ahora que me tienes tú te alejas

Y es que su cara refleja el mar
Caí en sus redes y me dio el mal
Mentiste que el precio su piel 
Con nada yo lo pueda pagar

Y si tus labios son puro veneno 
Yo me quiero envenenar 
Y si tu piel me quema como el fuego 
Nuestros cuerpos arderán

Y si tus labios son puro veneno

Ahora despierto cada madrugada
Buscando ser eterno soñando en su almohada
Buscándose lo que te alumbre tu cuerpo
Imagino tu silueta sentada en mi cama

Es que ya no sé, no sé si volver a ver
La malicia que me atrapa y me lleva hasta tu ser
Esos ojos de serpiente que un fastasma ve

No me puedes negar que yo vivo en tus sueños
Yo ya no puedo más

Y es que su cara refleja el mar
Caí en sus redes y me dio igual
Mentiste que el precio su piel 
Con nada yo lo pueda pagar

Nyno Vargas,"Yo sé que aunque no soy tu dueño
Te hago vivir un sueño cuando te hago el amor

Aunque él está en tus pensamientos
Yo conozco tu cuerpo, no hay comparación
Miénteme y dime que ya no piensas en mí
No seas tonta y acepta que yo soy mejor que él

Mírame y dime que con él eres feliz
Si cuando besas sus labios tú me imaginas a mí

Sabes que soy yo, yo, quien te hace feliz
Decídete ya, di con quien te vas
Sabes que soy yo, yo, quien te hace feliz
Decídete ya, di con quien te vas

Aún recuerdo aquella noche en la que te marchaste
Como siempre tú la buena y yo el culpable
Te esfumaste de mis brazos como se va el viento
Y aunque pase el tiempo no pude olvidarte

Mientras tanto yo viviendo en la oscuridad
Sufriendo cada día un poquito más
Ahora que estás con él vuelves a llamar
Diciéndome que quieres regresar

Él tendrá tu cuerpo pero no tu amor
Yo llené lo que él nunca consiguió
Ahora pregúntale a tu corazón
Sabes que quien manda en él soy yo, yo
Quien te hace feliz
Decídete ya, di con quien te vas

Sabes que soy yo, yo, quien te hace feliz
Decídete ya, di con quien te vas

Tanto tiempo que no puedo estar sin verte otra vez
Y si tú te marchas hoy lo comprenderé
Dame una razón para yo olvidar
No quiero vivir mi vida soledad
Vuelve de allá no aguanto más
Decídete sin mirar atrás

Desde que te fuiste, me siento perdido
Necesito la luz que me llega tu cariño
Desde que te fuiste, ya no soy el mismo
Yo sé que llegaré y no importa el camino

Sabes que soy yo, yo, quien te hace feliz
Decídete ya, di con quien te vas
Sabes que soy yo, yo, quien te hace feliz
Decídete ya, di con quien te vas

A lo largo del camino, conoces a miles de personas,
Hasta que un día, llega alguien que te cambia la vida
Porque ni la distancia ni el tiempo pueden con el destino

En mi barquito que es de papel

Seran sus ojitos o su piel canela

Se viene conmigo a ver las estrellas

Me va matando esta obsesión
Salio a bailar con sus amigas
Es mi ocasión
 
Que nadie se entere lo que va a pasar
Tú no tengas miedo déjate llevan

The search for strength to carry on
My every hope had seemed to die
My eyes had no more tears to cry
Then like the sun shined from up above
You surrounded me with your endless love
And all the things I couldn't see
Are now so clear to me 

You are my everything
Nothing your love won't bring
My life is yours alone
The only love I've ever known
Your spirit pulls me through
When nothing else will do
Every night I pray on bended knee
That you will always be
My everything 

Now all my hopes and all my dreams
Are suddenly reality
You've opened up my heart to feel
The kind of love that's truly real
A guiding light that'll never fade
There's not a thing in life that I would ever trade
For the love you give and won't let go
I hope you'll always know 

You are my everything
Nothing your love won't bring

mad cause they know I'm stackin doe international
it's untouchable so they besta be jetti

I'm ready, to do this my way, hit the highway
crusin with control, let the AC blow
it's all about the doe and nothin less for sho

only stick around cause this shorties on my dick,
so take a lick sis your on your knees already
they thinkin petty, hypnotized by the fetti,
with your eyes steady, locked on what I got
tellin the block that I changed cause I came up on a ????
they must forgot when I rose sellin smoke
tryin to make an end we wasn't hangin tight then

Money bless, but money ain't the key to success
the only thing that changed was my name and address
now I dress to impress, the ladies I caress
fuck the stress I got to live life at it's best
but nevertheless, snakes want to put me to the test
cause they depress, broken smokin to much cess
so they manifest, jealousy and envy
and that will be the cause of another felony
see friends turn to foes, and foes is enemies,
and enemies is fleas so they got the tendencies
to try to seize, all your geez and assets
but I smash threats like a blast for the tec
so show respect, and get respect in return
it ain't hard to earn, but some niggas will never learn

Lies mal weiter! Nein man, das bist du uns beiden schuldig,
warum sagst du, einfach allen, wir sind beide schuldig?
Warum tust du, so als würdest du uns nicht mehr kennen?
Ja am Anfang, war ich noch dein Bruder, ich erkenn' dich jetzt nicht mehr.
Guck wo du uns reingeritten hast,
Hab keine Kraft, ich bleib allein, ich kack' hier ab. (Kack' hier ab.)
Geht's dir gut? Geniest du's jetzt im Geld zu schwimmen?
Dann geb' es aus solang du kannst, dieses Geld hier stinkt.
Sag war's das wert, uns dafür im Knast zu sehen?
Man hätt' ich das geahnt, ich hätt' dir meinen Teil abgegeben.
Sag mir schläfst du wirklich gut, in deinem weichem Bett?
Ich schlaf' nicht wirklich gut, auf diesem weißem Brett.
Ich dachte gerade, wir drei könnten uns vertrauen,
denk zurück, man, wir schwänzen sogar Schule um zu Klauen.
Es ist schon traurig, wenn man wegen Geld vergisst,
merkst du gerade nicht, dass du dich selber fickst?

O,"Yo
I gotta story, about money, women, and power
and who truly has it

Her name, seems to slip my mind
but her face is stuck in my brain
Can vaguely remember the day we met, see it had rained
the road over, on Soppovada was wet
And my car wasn't, huggin the terrain
So there I came into her lane
I was to blame but stopped my headlight in the front
'cause I ran into her back
But she didn't, over-react, 'cause her cruiser wasn't even scratched
In fact, now that I think, back, I was gettin macked
by a tender, oh yeah now I remember
Vanessa from Maryland, aggressive and tanned
It was December, of '94 and she was finding O attractive
Lookin like an actress, skilled in the art of macktress
She asked if I was cool, I said ""Sure
but damn I fell like manure because baby I ain't insured""
Her reply - ""Poor baby, don't worry, I understand
but man makes the money, money never makes the man
She said

	[Hook x2]
	Man makes the money, money never makes the man
	Man makes the money, money never makes the man
	Man makes the money, money never makes the man
	And that's real, and that's real

We started chillin, it was all the way live
She flipped me a downtown highrise in 1995
8-50i, no more sess highs, strictly chronic and thai
Rolled in place in a gold cigarette case
Liquorice papers for sweeter taste, my pockets was laced
with big head Benjamins, crushed in cinnamon, linen and black Gators
Platinum, chains, rings and bracelets
Found out she was a mule for the Mob
Had plans to rob, and wanted me in on the job
Bust this, disgusted, one night in the middle of sex
She asked O-Press - ""Are you down for this?""
And I said ""YES! Baby yes!"", ugh
I must confess it was a bit risky this way
But when she hugged and kissed me, uhh, I didn't care
Got to the point I didn't even wear underwear
'cause she would want it everywhere and anywhere
(Man makes the money, money never makes the money)

	[Hook w/ variations x2]
The matriarch was established, we was after the cabbage
To continue livin lavish she had a plan - hit her ex-man
for three hundred grand, I just put him to sleep
and keep it movin to a spot where, we used to creep
Agreed, greed, bubbled up inside me indeed
So on Friday when he received loot, I walked in and proceeded to shoot
nigga's in they knees, fuck 'freeze', yeah yeah
there's the money, oh shit and seventeen keys
Stashed up and shit, shot to the designated spot
at the designated time, she was late I had to wait
Escalated my mind to stop the shakes
I had just shot niggas up, like a scene out of Carlito's Way
She walked in around ten
I was in the corner with my 9 sayin ""I thought eight was the time
we had agreed upon"" but I noticed she was nervous
I said ""What's goin on?"", that's when she blurted
""??? heard about the Mob, how we did it, the money - give it
Trust me baby, I'll be back in a minute""
Then she kissed me on my face, grabbed me up under my waist
and left, I sat for three hours and still not a trace
Soft nigga, I got the seventeen, I'ma just dip
That's when the cops showed up, talkin bout an anonymous tip
They got the dirty cookers and the pure uncooked
Took me and my attorneys hell just to get me one L
With no possibilities of parole I was lost
Vanessa made me made loot and made off
Uh, what?
I said Vanessa made me, made loot and made off

	[Hook to fade]
	Man makes the money, money never makes the man
	Man makes the money, money never makes the man
	She said she said
	Man makes the money, money never makes the man
	Man makes the money, money never makes the man
	What what, what what

So much game in a Too $hort rap
Blacks can't be white and whites can't be black
Why you want to act like someone else?
All you gotta do is just be yourself
We're all the same color underneath
Short Dog's in the house you'd better listen to me
Never be ashamed of what you are
Proud to be black stand tall at heart
Even though some people give you no respect
Be intelligent, when you put em in check
Cause when you're ignorant, you get treated that way
And when they throw you in jail you got nothing to say
So if you don't listen it's not my fault
I'll be getting paid while you'll be paying the cost
Sitting in the jailhouse running your mouth
While me and my peoples try to get out

Verse One: Charli Baltimore

I don't know if it's the pretty face or the expensive taste
That got everybody wantin' to touch me like Case
Feels So Good like Mase, to pull over
Anywhere I want, diplomats on the Rover
The way I put it on a nigga sober
I have 'em comin' back, knockin' on my door like Johovas
Ya'll already know that Charli's in charge
Weekly massage, platnuim and gold cars
Money stashed in NY to Witchitaw
And I stay with my niggas cause you know how bitches are
Aggy, cause they baby daddy want to bag me
That's why I never leave home without the 44
Ya'll hoes can't do nothin' to me
I got this game wrapped like a dubee
Pinned up in what?
Charli rappin' about, I really got
And it ain't that I'm stuck on myself, I'm really hot

Chorus

For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)
For the love of money (gots to have it, eh-heh)
For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)
For the love of money (really need it, yeah)

Verse Two: Charli Baltimore

Yo yo yo, gimme the money
Rich bitch be swimmin' in money
I need Jet Ski's in mind, can't tease a dime
Lookin' in the mirror, feeling pleased with the shine
Lady Rolex for the time, the class is ""S""
Wear the ice on the bra of my chest
When the money ain't right I go far to the left
Niggas want to play games then Charli direct
want to Long Kiss Goodnight, don't hold ya breath
Bitches know I'm the shit with my MAC lipstick
Crushin' the player haters with a purple navigator
Shoes alligator, my bag is too
If I was broke like you, I would be mad like you
But you can come work for Charli, a boss with a body
Ask anybody, I could take over Gotti
Poo by the poo while you just another hottie
Niggas roll bricks that'll stay if it's notty

Chorus

For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)
For the love of money (gots to have it, eh-heh)
For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)

Verse Three: Charli Baltimore

Uh huh, yo when you look you see the slim waist leavin' no trace
Cause shit for no Charli will be in the breifcase
Yeah Long Kiss Goodnight, Baltimore get it right
For the cash, pop out the window and shoot through the ice
Ain't no love here, just the black gloves here
Check it, and I don't get by with nothin' I can't leave in 30 seconds
But my kids, they think mommy a teacher
They don't know, for the love of this
I make the whole world tre' dough
Bingo, get 'em ready for school like nothing happen
Here's a apple for the teacher, tell 'em mommy said ""Hi""
Bet he won't fail you no more, one more ""F"" and he die
Even with my nails done, I can take guns apart son
So when they come lookin' for this reporter broke Un
Dealt with birds, but I had to move on
But for none of these I tatto the little P-pac on my arm
Ask Un how the ones be when he advance me dough
So I put out mines and tell dawg keep yours yo

E dentro de uma área de exclusão

não é partido ou jazz
em que se improvise
não é casa moldada
laje que suba fácil

não tem disse me disse

no balcão do botequim
a prosa tá parada
não se fala da vida
não acontece nada
se não faltasse trabalho
no meio do barulho
o dia sobra
e sobra muito
papo de surdo e mudo
papo de surdo e mudo
surdo e mudo

parece dia de festa
todo mundo presente
se soubesse rimar
faria um samba antigo
onde reina a calma
e todo mundo é amigo

como um bafo

queima bem forte
vibrante e forte

Um oxente, um arriago da porra
De Rappa pra Rapadura,
De Rapadura pra Rafinha
Vem que vem, queridão
Deslancha com a sua poesia
Uma salva de palma rapaziada!
Nordestino até o osso (oxe)

Minhas irmãs, meus irmãos
Se assumam como realmente são
Não deixem que suas matrizes
Que suas raízes morram por falta de irrigação
Ser nortista e nordestino meus conterrâneos
Num é ser seco nem litorâneo
É ter em nossas mãos um destino
Nunca clandestino para os desfechos metropolitanos

Ei, Nortista agarra essa causa que trouxeste
Nordestino agarra a cultura que te veste

Rasgo de leste a oeste como peste do sul ao sudeste
Rap agreste norte-nordeste epiderme veste
Arranco roupas, verdades poucas, imagens foscas
Partindo pratos e bocas com tapas mato essas moscas
Toma! Eu meto lacres com backs derramo frases ataques
Atiro charques nas bases dos meus sotaques
Oxe! Querem entupir nossos fones a repetirem nomes
Reproduzindo seus clones se afastem dos microfones
Trazem um nível baixo
Para singles fracos, astros de cadastros
Não sigo seus rastros, negados padrastos
Cidade negada como madrasta, enteados já não arrasta
Esses órfãos com precatas, basta, ninguém mais empata
Meto meu chapéu de palha sigo pra batalha
Com força agarro a enxada
Se crava em minhas mortalhas
Tive que correr mais que vocês pra alcançar minha vez
Garra com nitidez rigidez me fez monstro camponês
Exerce influência, tendência
Em vivência em crenças destinos
Se assumam são clandestinos se negam não nordestinos
Vergonha do que são, produção sem expressão própria
Se afastem da criação morrerão por que são cópias
Não vejo cabra da peste só carioca e paulista
Só frestyleiro em nordeste não querem ser repentistas
Rejeitam xilogravura o cordel que é literatura
Quem não tem cultura jamais vai saber o que é rapadura
Foram nossas mãos
Que levantaram os concretos os prédios
Os tetos os manifestos, não quero mais intermédios
Eu quero acesso direto às rádios, palcos abertos
Inovar em projetos protestos arremesso fetos
Escuta! A cidade só existe por que viemos antes
Na dor desses retirantes com suor e sangue imigrante
Rapadura eu venho do engenho rasgo os canaviais
Meto o norte nordeste
O povo no topo dos festivais, toma!

Nordestino agarra a cultura que te veste

A fé no sufoco da vela abençoada no dia dormido
O fogo já não existe ali saíram do abrigo
São quase nada
A molecada corre e corre, ninguém 'tá triste
A molecada corre e corre, ninguém 'tá

Se tudo move, o prédio é santo
Se é pobre mais pobre fica
Vira bucha de balão ao som de funk
E apertada tua avenida
A cera foi tarrada
Não se admire

And she hi-di-lan-di-dee, and she hi-di-lan-di-dee and she lan- day

And her buckles shone like silver
She had a dark and a rolling eye
And her ear-rings tipped her shoulder

O'Connell,"Oh, the time will come up
When the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'
Like the stillness in the wind
Before the hurricane begins
The hour that the ship comes in

And the seas will split
And the ship will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Then the tide will sound
And the wind will pound
And the morning will be breaking

Oh, the fishes will laugh
As they swim out of the path
And the seagulls they'll be smiling
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in

And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean

A song will lift
As the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline
And the sun will respect
Every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in

Then the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a-touchin'
And the ship's wise men
Will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'

Oh, the foes will rise
With the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
And know that it's for real
The hour when the ship comes in

Then they'll raise their hands
Sayin' we'll meet all your demands
But we'll shout from the bow your days are numbered
And like Pharaoh's tribe
They'll be drownded in the tide
And like Goliath, they'll be conquered",When the Ship Comes In,1995

When the long time had evened out
When we'd reach the end of spring 
And her covered eyes pressed close to mine
We would clip children's wings

I'll come for everyone in my long black dress
I'll comfort everyone when the rest
Pray for me, pray for me, pray for me, just pray
Pray for me, pray for me. Pray for me, just pray
I'll come for everyone in my long black dress
I'll comfort everyone when the rest

You choose your fate gracefully 
Save your soul if you can 
Life is shorter everyday my nigga make the right moves 
Choose your hustle spots wisely police give you the blues 
Lock you up put a strike by your name you on paper 
See the white boy be on every money and your paper 
Put the weed down now cause we face incarceration 
Stipulations of probation strike two is what you're facin 
In the mandatory joes, now you ain't gon bounce 
Short timin round them lifers hopin that you touch down 
If I see the free world again, I'm a ball 
Put my back up on the wall hopin blessins from the lord 
3rd strike twenty to life nigga I choose death 
Leave a coppers scar wet I ain't aimin for the chest 
44 chrome to the dome, uzi man did it 
Once again Prime Suspect guilty til proven innocent 



[Chorus] 


[Mystikal] 
I'm sweatin cause it's hot and humid outside 
The spot where we lay it down 
I amplify the city streets and terrorize the underground 
Nigga respect gangsta and run in the streets they walk on 
FBI might finish listenin to the car phone I talk on 
Waitin on me, wantin me to mess up, put my hands in some dirt 
But I'm a legitimate businessman, I sell light green t-shirts 
Go on officer leave me alone, I ain't be got no weapon 
I don't even know what you talkin bout, I be makin records 
Hits size I'm too busy for this bull and kicks 
Was it tinted when you pulled this six 
Over to the side of the road 
Got my hand on my heater cause I'm tired of you hoes 
Let the dog sniff my vehicle and my clothes 
But I bet I make it home cause you gotta let me go 
I'm too cold for an iron box 
I need city lights, the projects, and the boondocks 

[Chorus] 

[Prime Suspect #2] 
I'm lookin for that wall 
So I can put my back up against it 
Cause it ain't no love from the beginnin to the endin 
They got me pledgin the flag that want to see me doin 10 in 
See it's vicious out chea on these 3rd world streets 
Them people tryin to stop the hustle 
But yet they survivor just like me 
Makin liquidate runnin in them hater streets 
So I tell my brother get the cake for me if need be 

[Prime Suspect #3] 
Look let me run into ya'll cause the pilots burnin over 
I've been doin the same thing since lil 
But now I'm called a soldier 
And I'm older and watch fake soldiers transform cause they own 
See them same soldiers upstate and they ain't bout no home 
Why it's already a livin hell for the average thick soldiers 
Survival of the fittest watch yourself 
Is what poppa always told me 
Why we already misled, bustin hot metals 
I just need to step back and take a look 
Cause they liquidatin the ghetto

People always talkin 'bout. 
(I'm what, say what? I'm what, say what?)
You're a hustler .
(I'm what, say what? I'm what, say what?)
I don't care what the others think, 
Just be straight with me, (I'm what say what?)

Huh? Huh? Huh? 
I know I take chances to make sure I'm sittin' tight.
Do I get how I live, sometimes I don't get it right.
My gold and platinum plaques make you know what we did.
Have the whole world wonderin' what Silkk The Shocker, Master P did.
See it ain't no limit, it's only the beginnin'.
Why? 'Cuz all y'all want us to fall, and hit the wall.
It'll only take a minute, an' see I gets the bomb tree.
Beats by the Pound shit, it sound sick, rolex, and baguettes all.
I take this out the ghetto an' live up on top.
Akin flights, an shoppin' sprees, on 5-0-4 yachts.
See, money don't change me, make me live a lil' bit good.
Took some of my family members, an' my homies out the hood.
See, we ghetto millionaires, far away when we meet.
I think they watched us, P, 'cuz about when we speak.
See I'm too deep to change, everybody know my name.
I guess I gotta charge it to da game.

[Chorus]

Ugh! Green money, I like to count, honey.
My only bad habit that I like to sell B's, honey.
We hot, check the Billboard spot.
Twenty-four g's an' P's to make a club rock.
Now they violent, gotta get it rowdy.
Peep game gotta Benz, Lex Luger in or out it.
Don't hate me, the money don't make me.
It's gonna take two hundred million just to break me,
'Cuz I'm a soldier, I thought I told ya.
I like that doja, but hate the rollers.
Crystal, greed, an hinace, got cream. 
Makes a brother in a Bentley, from the ghetto.
There ain't no limit 'cuz we livin' large.
Bought a rolex, a yacht, with a gold card.
You done lately, your girl wanna date me, in my grill.
For, Ugh, an' I'm straight g.

[Chorus]

I guess they call me a hustler, 'cuz of the fast livin'.
But if I see somethin' I gotta get it, because I have vision.
An' if I like it, I gotta get, if I saw it.
Went from, over the shows, over the doors,
House full of floors that's marble, a brand new Ferrari.
Parked it, when I bought it, see, I'm a no limit soldier.
An' I came to get it started, what you, what you think?
I'm all about my bank, tryin' to be a multi-millionaire.
Before I'm old enough to drink, now we can ride, bro.  No lie, bro.
See, nobody be here beside us, so go ahead an fire it up.
Some girls wanna perk it, my homies like to work it.
Soldiers from Texas, all the way to Jersey.
Tick to the tock, all around the clock.
From the north, to the south, 
To the east, to the west, it just don't stop.
So to all my real g's, throw them up high,
To all the ballers that have the corks of Crystal, let it fly.
That's how we live.

O'Dell,"This song is dedicated to all the responsible brothers other there
who's how love and support to their children
I'd like to say thank you
'cause I have a very important man in my life
He means the world to me
He helped make into the strong woman I am today
I'm talkin about my Daddy

Verse One:

I think back to the first time I messed up
You knew that I need to be
But you couldn't chastise me
Daddy's little girl
Most precious of all
You loved me more than anything
Your real life babydoll
Bounced me on your knee
Taught me how to throw my set up
Said you ain't got no brothers
Fight dirty
Don't take nothin
Saw you bustin your butt to keep the bills paid
Saw you hustlin for extras
For more pay you made a way
And tried to keep us happy up in the house
'cause you wasn't tryin to see 
Your queen or your princess pout
Doubtin out sometimes
But you tried to hide your pain
And be a tru playa in this white man's game
Never called my mama out of her name
Showed respect
Never put your hands on her
Even when she backed you in a corner
So Iwant to say you are appreciated
And this love song is dedicated to my daddy

Chorus:  repeat 2X

Thank you Daddy
I know that I'm blessed
To have a father like you
'cause you've done your best
Under so much stress in the crazy world
God knows you tried
Even when they got your hands tied

Verse Two:

Remember when I came home seventeen and pregnant
And unexpectedly
But your disappointment never did show
You looked me in my teary eyes
Then you smiled
Put yoru arms around me
Said my baby's giving me a grandchild
Showed my boyfriend love too
Didn't come preachin or beefin
Just said you know what you gotta do
And when he didn't
You didn't rub it in
You just did his part
And tried to heal my young broken heart
I thought the things you said way back for certain
was jus to try and keep me a virgin
But with all the hurtin and the drama I been through
I wish I would have listened to you
'cause it was all true
Daddy the man who loves me unconditionally
through thick and thin
You'll always stand by me (fo sho)
Daddy I love you with all my heart
You're my souljah
My hero
My shining star
Thank you

Chorus:  repeat 2X

Verse Three:

I gotta give love to all the real strong brothers
Responsible daddies
Even if you're not with your baby's mothers
Your support
Your love and your time
Helps keep your children in the right frame of mind
And to the single fathers out there
Much respect
I'm a single parent too
So I know where you're at
And where you're coming from baby
But it's gonna get better
Hold your head through the stormy weather
And stand your ground firm
And all my sisters with good men at your side
It sure feels good to see the ??? family rise
I've cried joyful tears
Happy as can be
To see man woman and child
As one family
See the cards are stacked up against us y'all
So we gotta work it out
Can't let em see us fall
But most of all 
Thank you God
'cause for years I had an example of what a real man is
My daddy

Chorus:  repeat 2X

Oh I want to thank you for all you've done for me
I want to thank you",Daddy,1998

O'Dell,"I remember when we were kids
We shed all our hurt and tears (and tears)
No matter what the weather, what the weather
We were always togerther (always together)
We grew up as time went on
We became separated (seperated)

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away ( when my homie went away)
It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When Kevin went away (when Kevin went away)

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away ( when my homie went away)
It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When Kevin went away (when Kevin went away)

Kevin life ain't tha even tho we gots tah change
See momma don't understand how you died in tha game
And grandma get older, Little Kevin he's a soldier
We done made it out da ghetto ain't no more run'n for tha rollers
Tattooed your face on my arm so you legacy could live on
You said ""P be strong"" with out you we all alone
I know its been a few years you your birthday we shed tears
And I don't wanna question you God
But why he took you and left us here?

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)
It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)

Look, just thinkin about you my nigga bring tears to my eyes
I mean I'm hard and all but even tha realish niggaz cry
And when you left, part of me died too
And who ever knew Kevin like I knew Kevin shhh ya'll would cry too
Just think'n about you, if you were still here
How much different remenisin on one of your pictures
Lookin at the family thinkin we always got one miss'n
And I can still remember tha last words (and mine ain't even started)
Look your never forgotton 'cause on your birthday I go and put flowers on your
Grave
I still remember when P and see broke tha news to me at school about your death
Told me ""Silkk time would heal our wounds""
It's been oh five years and I ain't healed yet
Now I feel somthing I'm tryin tryin to be strong
I know moms tryin to hold on
Even tho your here and your gone
I got so many questions, that's why I can't move on
(It's somthing about you)

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)
It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)

Now as I could remember (remember)
A couple of months before December (December)
I still can't take tha pain
We all are stuck in this ghetto rain
I learned my lesson, could your blessings
Watch your enemys and watch your friends
And if it ain't your blood don't show that man no love
'Cause kindness make you weak and cause blindness in tha streets
And the vultures commin to get you
When none of you're real homies is wit ya
And its sad can't break the cycle
And take a drink wit my uncle Michael
And my momma question my silence
But I blame this sinceless violence
Don't wanna wake up 'cause when imma asleep
You still alive up in my dreams
A few seconds of happy thoughts to keep my mind at eaze
And then Kevin its like you ghost my body freeze when ever I see him
If anybody got yours ways, you know it'd be him

Uh!
It's da black rain to da moon and tears that cause lies
See that's the way I felt when my lil' brother died.
And some fools say it ain't no justice 
And other niggaz say it ain't no peace
That's why thugs help their on these projects and on these streets.
See my daddy made me a dealer
And my cousin made me killer.
See that's why everything we do, they gonna respect us and feel us
And I'm still tryin' to understand why big daddy was with da rest
And my nephew on the last counter on da 14th down the car reck.
It ain't muthafucker down on dope, on crack, or aids
And I see so many ghetto people go to jail 
And live your life and die like slaves.
I got a relative on apeel doin' 25 flat
On murder or ride nigga fuck it Johnny Cochran can't fight that.
And since I'm black and I'm rich 
They see to overlook It's me advise
First class niggaz tryin' call da police tryin' to book us.
Ain't that a bitch, I done made millions 
And still goin' through a thang
That's niggaz ask me P why the fuck you never change.

So with life on line put all up 4 him so I put that shit on TRU.
The ghetto got me caught up, no broken dreams
The ghettos trap, I see some on crack, and dope fiends.
My hommie, Never did no crime but lien' up in the hearse
Thank god 4 all that I got from that times can be worst.
Ever feel like you was swimming, and really was dronin'
You ain't want to smile but your tender smile always see me clownin'
I trade my life to make the world better 
Trade everything I got including life 
To bring back my brother Kevin.
See I spit the realist shit 
Tryin' make y'all feel this shit.
Y'all tryin' put the finger on our side, 
Livin' middle bricks livin' this shit.
See I tell you everybody use to ride benzes 
But we had to ride buggies
Mom wanted better things for me 
But private school was way past our budget.
So if I'm  happy and I'm smilin' and I'm camouflage my problems
The only way I can really solve them 
If I really grab and revolve them.
So I grab it and I cocked it
I was going to pop it.
But I stop, forgot I was rich.
What everybody not rich.
Every month so close to gettin' no profits
My only hustle, I told them to stop it, 
But can't really knock it.
Everybody died up in game 
Everybody tryin' to maintain 
Wall from out da ghetto, 
Close my eyes and still see the pain.
Sometimes I just get fed up.
To all my souljas worldwide 
I know its hard to stride. 
Keep your head up!

Never type to creep Alwayz tried to make things work
What What

Chorus

[Silkk The Shocker]
I want to be with you but i can't hope you understand and all
Tried to make this thang work
Got knocked you'll be the first person i call
Now with you can be myself
with her it's like i'm living a lie
I do everything for her it seems like she never satisfied
If i give her 3 karats then she probably want four
If I want to go places then she probably just don't want to go
Now sometimes I feel like we settled
in the back of our minds
we all feel like we can find something better
Now with you it' like you know me
Like her she really don't understand me
I know I live the way I live
But she's all for changing me
I don't care for girl with no money
When I come home I ain't tryin to cuss
Am I asking for much?
But I can't sit here and pretend
I don't care
To have both y'all along
That wouldn't be fair
So if it's a puzzle
I think I maybe just missing a clue
Leave or Stay?
God tell me what's a nigga to do
What What What

ooh

Hice, tantas cosas tantas que al final no me sirvieron
Ya ni recuerdo quien tocó primero, si la fama o el dinero
Yo intenté por tantos años y sembré mi turno como hombre
Y aunque no me acuerde cuándo y dónde
Fue que el mundo se aprendió mi nombre y es que

Entre lujos y dinero me arropaba el frío
Entre cámaras y fama me sentía vacío
Y cuando todo mi mundo se ahogaba en lo hondo
Llegaste tú, justo antes de que yo tocara fondo
Entre lujos y dinero me arropaba el frío
Entre cámaras y fama me sentía vacío
Y cuando todo mi mundo se ahogaba en lo hondo
Llegaste tú justo antes de que yo tocara fondo, ooh
Tocara fondo, ooh

Siempre hay un amor, que sin ser el primero
Te hace olvidar todo lo que no es
Ese es el amor verdadero

Esta es una historia sin final, un cuento sin terminar
Y al caminar, al fin entiendo con quien debo estar
Siempre solía aparentar entre mis lujos y la fama
Pero la soledad, me acompañaba aquí en mi cama
Eres mi guía, desde que llegaste todos mis días, se arreglaron
Ya mis noches no son frías, eres todo lo que quería 
conversando con mil estrellas fugaces
Sin conocerte pero deseando que llegases
En mi armario, tengo guardados cartas e itinerarios
¿Quién dijo que un hombre no tiene diario?
Para escribir lo necesario, ¿cómo?, ¿cuándo? y ¿dónde?, fecha y horario
Aparecías en mis pensamientos involuntarios
Si me pides una estrella yo muevo el cielo y la tierra
Cuido el suelo donde pisas y voy removiendo piedras
Porque solo te mereces lo mejor
Entraste en vida en tiempo de blanco y negro a darle color

Entre lujos y dinero me arropaba el frío
Entre cámaras y fama me sentía vacío
Y cuando todo mi mundo se ahogaba en lo hondo
Llegaste tú, justo antes de que yo tocara fondo
Entre lujos y dinero me arropaba el frío
Entre cámaras y fama me sentía vacío
Y cuando todo mi mundo se ahogaba en lo hondo
Llegaste tú justo antes de que yo tocara fondo, ooh
tocara fondo ooh, yeah

(Y si me hubiera muerto sin haberte conocido
Me atrevería decir que morir
Sin nunca haber vivido)

Mi polli te confieso, mientras estoy parado en este altar 
Esperando que tú llegues, no paro de suspirar
Y de pensar en que te adoro, eres mi gran tesoro
Y de que no te cambiaría, por la fama ni el oro
No me gustan los tatuajes, pero me marqué tu nombre
Soy capaz de muchas cosas, mai bebé yo soy tu hombre
Es que tú me complementas, si no sabes te las inventas
Eres la calma, en medio de toda mis tormentas
No me olvido, cuando te vi por primera vez
Es la mujer que rondabas mi sueño desde la niñez
Casi te pierdo, pero nunca perdí la fe
Me lo propuse, trabajé duro y te conquisté
Ahora o nunca, por ti nadaría los sietes mares
Prometo estar contigo hasta que la muerte nos separe
Es mi deber, cuidar y proteger esa mujer
Que dios puso en camino y es un nuevo amanecer

Entre lujos y dinero me arropaba el frío
Entre cámaras y fama me sentía vacío
Y cuando todo mi mundo se ahogaba en lo hondo
Llegaste tú, justo antes de que yo tocara fondo
Entre lujos y dinero me arropaba el frío
Entre cámaras y fama me sentía vacío
Y cuando todo mi mundo se ahogaba en lo hondo
Llegaste tú justo antes de que yo tocara fondo, ooh
tocara fondo, ooh

Y si me atreviera decir todo lo que siento
Me quedaría corto
No existen las palabras
Para expresar este sentimiento

Baby so spontaneous got me high like angel dust
Yo sheets got us tangled up
You like it rough when it feel like you mangled up
You kno backshots my favorite angle what
Yo booty wiggle like a bowl of jelly
Got me hard as metal I'm beyond yo level
Cool and melo cova ya bed wit rose pedals

[2nd Verse]
I guess that's what I get
To trying to play around
I pushed up on the wrong shorty
To put a little somethin on me
I didn't see it comin
I was only thinkin about me
I had to get caught this time
Now the tricks on me

[Hook]
Know what, know what, know what, know what
Talkin to you wasn't suppose ta be no thang
You know, you know, you know, you know
'cause I was just outbein me there doin my thang
Know what, know what, know what, know what
And I didn't even think twice about it girl
Say what, say what, say what, say what
Fa'real I just thought you were anotha shorty

I thought you were jus anotha shorty I put the naughty on
A hit it and quit and get gone
I was wrong
You threw me for a look ya know
I thought you jus anotha shorty I put the naughty on
But you got to me
Can't you see

You threw me for a look ya know ya know - [4x]

O'Ryan,"Damn you playing games already
'Cause you sorta got me sea-sick, waving your belly
Like in and out then out and then in
Then back to out, girl drop your friends

'Cause I ain't trying to have 'em with us all night
Face looking all tight, ask if it's alright
If you just leave for a minute, come back
My mind freeze for a minute, but your waist throwback

You looking good in that teeny-weeny-mini skirt
Girl you hot as a shorty, any cherry-red lipstick
Sucking a lollipop, winding your body
Looking at me, ma' you know you need to stop

You got my hands all over you
Girl you got something, nothing I don't do
And I can see you're down to do whatever
You's a girl gone wild so now it's going down tonight

Shorty love the club, and she like to go
On and on and on and on and on and
She love the club and she like to make it
Drop and crank it up and ride the pony

Shorty love the club, and she like to go
On and on and on and on and on and
She love the club and she like to make it
Get it, get it girl, get it, get it girl

Shorty's bad as hell and she knows it, ferocious
I could've sworn I seen mami on a poster
And she keeps moving closer and closer
She's a pro so I don't have to coach her

I'm digging her 'cause she handle her business
My hand on her hip, when I dip then she dip
And all the homies want to dance with her
'Cause she's hot to death, young and sexy, she loves the club

Shorty love the club, and she like to go
On and on and on and on and on and
She love the club and she like to make it
Drop and crank it up and ride the pony

Shorty love the club, and she like to go

She love the club and she like to make it
Get it, get it girl, get it, get it girl

Wait, I need time to breathe
Just a minute and I promise I'mma follow your lead
And we could, two step to the bass line
Hands on your waistline, I don't understand why we waste time

'Cause you bumped and grind
And the reason why we still here, stumps my mind, mama
I see you sorta looking like you want more
So we can do the same thing with our clothes off, holla

Girl, we might as well, be crushing on the floor
Our bodies so close, your skin is so soft
Tonight I'mma slide with you, girl

Girl, do you like what you see?
Girl you know what you're doing
Turn around and dance for me

Now dance little mama
You like it when I shake my, don't you? Yeah
Now dance little mama
Let me show you what I'm twerking with, whoa

Now dance little mama
Like to go on and on and on and on and on and

I'm sick of one direction down
I'm a broken picture frame
My whole world twisted inside out

Screaming voices like a hurricane
Telling me to wake up, get out of bed
Put your feet on the floor
There's fresh air out the door

And I've been acting so pathetic
Knocking around like a ball on a string
It's taking time for me to get it
I'm ready and willing to do anything to make it up to you

My arms are hurting so bad from being so empty
My heart weighs like a ton 'cause it feels so heavy
I'm standing here all alone, wishing that I could've known
You just can't walk away from the damage

Last time, I'm playing with a broken string
It don't matter no one's listening
'Cause losing you has made me see
I've gotta change, gotta blame it all on me

My hands may as well be tied 'cause I just can't touch you

Somehow I've gotta find a way to wake up from the damage

There was a Buffalo Soldier
In the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival

She was cold and hungry
I gave her all that I could
I was sure that she loved me
And we were thick as thieves.

Through the winter I kept her warm
Fed her all she desired
When she told me in so many words
I was the one to save her life
And she would never forget
And I would never be left.

But then one day
I ran out of bread
And wood to keep the fire
And when I woke

Take back the props from Pete Rock Quest and them boys

Take back the night we did, ""Speed"", at four in the mornin'
Even take back the day I met ninth in the dorm
Y'all can re-write the history to settle the score
And I still be writin' wizardry like never before

'Cause I broke down this year almost lost my clarity
Felt wicked times needed God to carry me
Like, when I found success but lost my family
In the process I will not let you bastards handle me

Lookin' for some guidance, so I figured
I pray to God and He said, Tigga
Low I ain't let you run it back this far

Could be gone in a second, that's life in perspective

Mixing my colors 
How could I ever find the blue of your eyes
The canvas could never capture the light of your smile
And girl if I were a sculpter
Working in my world 
I couldn't hope to appeal perfect face
The curve of your body
The feel of your skin
My hands could never ever trace

Chorus:
So I'll try and find a melody as beautiful as you
Find the words to say your eyes are bluer than blue
Fill my voice with the emotion I'm feeling for you
And now when the beat is so strong
I'll give my heart in a song

If I were an actor
I could be someone
Someone who always knows
The right things to say
But as soon as I see you 
I'd forget all my lines
And you'd never know what I feel inside

There's no other way
That I know to say
Baby how much I love you
And if you'll only give me a chance
Oh girl
I will try and find a melody as beautiful as you

I'm sick of one direction down
I'm a broken picture frame

Screaming voices like a hurricane
Telling me to wake up, get out of bed
Put your feet on the floor
There's fresh air out the door

And I've been acting so pathetic
Knocking around like a ball on a string
It's taking time for me to get it
I'm ready and willing to do anything to make it up to you

My arms are hurting so bad from being so empty
My heart weighs like a ton 'cause it feels so heavy
I'm standing here all alone, wishing that I could've known
You just can't walk away from the damage

Last time, I'm playing with a broken string
It don't matter no one's listening
'Cause losing you has made me see
I've gotta change, gotta blame it all on me

My hands may as well be tied 'cause I just can't touch you

Somehow I've gotta find a way to wake up from the damage

O.A.R.,"Oh my
20 throw down in my fist of rage
And the man to my left has folded down
Well Johnny doubled up with a royal flush

I had three Jacks and a pair of nines
My mind is turning, just two shots more
There's not much left to play
Well then dude walks in, black hat on top

What am I, if I'm lucky
Wasn't a county cop
'Cause I'm just runnin' out of time

Who's up for game two
What to do
My wallet's gettin' thin
And I just lost my watch last night
Well I gotta problem

Just one answer
Gotta throw it all down
And kiss it goodbye
Yeah!

That was a crazy game of poker (That was a crazy game of poker)
I lost it all (I lost it all)

But someday I'll be back again
And I, never to fold. (Never to fold)

Who's up for game three
I can barely see the bourbon drowning next to me
And I just lost it all
Well there's a man sittin' next to me
Red, was smiling

'Cause it's funny
I don't have no money tonight
Yeah

That was a crazy game of poker (That was a crazy game of poker)
I lost it all (I lost it all)

But someday I'll be back again
And I, never to fold. (Never to fold)

Bop bop bop
I say now skittlee dat dat,
Well how bout that?
I'm coming out the front never coming out the back
And I walked into the bar yesterday
'Cause I had something to do, something to say

And Johnny walked in right behind me
And I didn't turn around
'Til I heard the sound of his feet
Falling on the ground

I looked over my shoulder and I saw a clown
And I said what'cha doin' in the bar tonight.
So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?
He looked at me with a face full of fright

And I said, how 'bout a revolution?
And he said right.
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say jah
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say jah jah jah
Jehovah!

And I said, what'cha looking at?
He hit me across the face with a bat
I grabbed my .45 and I said let's get out and go
So he opened the door and said
Do what you're here for

I said I'm wandering round the road four to four
And I said I been walking
For about a thousand years.
And my feet are growing tired

My eyes a little wired
Don't know what to do unless I retire
And he just said let's play some crazy poker

So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?
He looked at me with a face full of fright
And I said, how 'bout a revolution?
And he said right.
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say die
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say die dah dah
Day day oh!

I said that, was the craziest game of poker that I ever saw
I said that, was the craziest game of poker that I ever saw
But I'm not gonna quit and I'm not gonna stop
I don't give a shit cause I got the drop

Johnny just got two eyes just like mine
And I'm feeling kinda funky, kinda fine
And I drank a bottle of whiskey, 'fore I came
Came to the bar to see what's the same

I saw my man named Johnny sittin' across the table from me
And to my left was a man, he had no chin
Didn't really think about starting a scene
The man to my right wasn't feeling kinda nice

He looked kinda mad and I felt bad
Because I took his money last night it's kinda funny
But now I'm just struggling
I need a honey-bunny.

I don't know what to say anymore
So I'm just gonna go out, anywho
So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?
He looked at me with a face full of fright

And I said, how bout a revolution?
And he said right.

I'll give it a while, but that's not my style, now how is that a crime?

And like the wind you snuck up on me
Got me begging for your storm

And trust me girl

O.A.R.,"I had a dream about you
It was December in the afternoon
You're something pretty and cool
Signing records as you're passing through

You saw everyone as an angel
But what about the thieves?
Who don't know what do
And don't know who to be
You saw everyone as an angel
But what about the thief?
Who took away from you
He took away from you

If you just kept walking on your way
If you just kept walking on your way
If you just kept walking on, walking on, walking on your way

Behind the archway lies a thief
Awaiting double fantasy
He's something evil underneath
Outside Dakota died the symphony

I think everyone has a devil waiting in the wings
When you don't know what to do
And you don't know who to be
You saw everyone as an angel
But what about the thief?
Who took away from you
Took away from you

If you just kept walking on your way
If you just kept walking on your way
If you just kept walking on, walking on, walking on your way

Maybe this is just a nightmare
And I will wake up
We all will wake up
Maybe this is just a nightmare

Pick your feet up
And let it burn.

Something 'bout these alleyways just turns me around.
Could've been a night in a fight with the dark,
Or maybe I'm a broken-heart in Battery Park.

And all I ever asked for was a shot in the dark,
And when you showed it to me, must've lit up a spark
Burning for you..

So bring down your walls,
Down with 'em all,
Let 'em fall.

After we all started to crawl,
The fire was real.

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

The weaker I grow

I'll grow colder
I'll lose myself in anything but you now
For there is nothing I can do now

But forget

And slow
I'll forget you

No dreams of leaning in the dark above you

With the chance that you are near
And every morning whispers

Not to move closer

To pull away from your glow

O.B.C.,"David walked into the valley
With a stone clutched in his hand
He was only a boy but he knew someone must take a stand
There will always be a valley
Always mountains one must scale
There will always be perilous waters which someone must sail
Into valleys, into waters
Into jungles, into Hell
Let us ride, let us ride home again with a story to tell!
Into darkness, into danger
Into storms that rip the night
Don't give in, don't give up but give thanks for the glorious fight!
You can tremble, you can fear it
But keep your fighting spirit alive, boys!
Let the shiver of it sting you
Fling into battle, spring to your feet, boys!
Never hold back your step for a moment
Never doubt that your courage will grow
Hold your head even higher and into the fire we go!
Are there mountains that surround us?
Are there walls that block the way?
Knock them down, strip them back, boys
And forward and into the fray!
Into terror, into valour
Charge ahead no never turn
Yes it's into the fire we fly
And the devil will burn
Someone has to face the valley
Rush in we have to rally and win, boys
When the world is saying not to
You know you've got to march on, boys

Never doubt that your courage will grow
Hold your head even higher and into the fire we go!

Let the flash of it shock you
Choke your fears away
Pull as tight as a wire
Let the fever spike
Let the force of it rock you
We will have our day sailing into the fire!

Someone has to face the valley
Rush in we have to rally and win, boys!

And it ain't just wrong or right

So disconnected

You know just what I need

as long as I
Can hold you near
It's gonna be alright
Won't have no fear

Watching it fade with the dawn
Wanting her back with me, warm in the moonlight
Knowing that moment was gone
Out of mind, out of sight,
Till the moon rose tonight

In a spill of moonlight, she was there
Though we both held very still
There was something pulling in the air
When she whispered through the dark
I tried hard to hold my ground
I believed I had a choice
Till the music in her voice
Turned my whole world around
I would like to understand
But the stars and I begin to blur
If she never touched my hand
Then what filled me with the feel of her?

In between us stood a wall
In a flash it fell apart
Is it possible she heard
Every last unspoken word
Racing out of my heart?
She never turned to me, but suddenly
We had so much to share!
I never took her in my arms, but she was there
Oh, she was there!
No, I never pulled her in
Still her tenderness was everywhere
Oh, she slipped beneath my skin
Just as if she'd always been right there

Who I followed like a star
And suddenly you changed
And now I don't know who you are
Or could it be that I never really knew you from the start

I know you right here, right with me
Man just riding on with his niggas
You heard me, I miss a lot of people
They know I miss them to

[Verse One]
Nigga took care for my heart
When they killed my dog
Ruined every last dream that we had to ball
Me and this nigga was like brothers
Since we was small
I needed anything he was the first I'd call
He was down the road with me
If I got in beef
By fucking them hoes with me
He was H-O-T
Kept it real and representing
Via-13 got a little girl
I treat like it's for me
and a lot of hoes conversation
It's B.G and L.T.
Never had a friend like him
He never had a friend like me
Snorted half a grand of dope
On the flight together
Broke trying to make all night together
Now Lil' Ten gon' be a part
Of my life forever
Wish Lord wouldn't of took you to rest you
Look me and my dog broke bread together
Hot, fucking hoes in the same bed together

[Chorus]
Of top, it's all gravy, you in six feet
Just remember I love you, so Rest In Peace
I still can't believe you left out here solo
I'm doing the damn thing for me and you both
Off top, it's all gravy, you in six fett
But remember I love you, so Rest In Peace
I still can't believe you left me out here solo
But I'm fucking hoes for me and you both

1997, November I had bad days in my life
It looked like that was the worst
Niggas shot my round like a dog
Left him for dead
Chest bust wide open
Non-stop he blead
Just the day before we talked about gettin sober
In the blink of an eye
My whodi life is over
I know there's a good reason
Why the good Lord chose you
I know when your at your real
Cause down here you was a soldier
Always said ""Do it, it can't be faded""
Always said ""Do it you gon' make it""
And I made It
I wish you were here to see
It's all gravy, I know you want me to let that be
Man I hate it
I know you don't want me to be weak
So when I sheine, you shine
It's off the T-O-P
You was the Livin' Legend in the UPT
Do me a favor you and my daddy look down on me

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
You should see I'm balling out of control
I just got a deal with Cotsh for six zeros
And I had to be heavenly baby and niggas was hoes
They wasn't playin the game

I'm a gangsta in the game I know the street rules
And I miss all my people that's resting in peace
And I miss all my people that's six feet deep

Speakin' in tongues, about what you did but you never done it
Admit you bit it cause the next man gained platinum behind it
I find it ironic, so I researched and analyzed
Most write about stuff they fantasized
I'm fed up with the bull, on this focus of weed and clips
And glocks gettin' cocked, and wax not bein' flipped
It's the same old same old just strain it from the anal
The contact, is not com-pexed or vexed
So why you puhsin' it?  Why you lyin' for?  I know where you live
I know your folks, you was a sucka as a kid
Your persona's drama, that you acquired in high school in actin' class
Your whole aura is plexi-glass
What's-her-face told me you shot this kid last week in the park
That's a lie, you was in church with your moms
See I know yo, slow your roll, give a good to go
Guys be lackin' in this thing called rappin' just for dough
Of course we gotta pay rent, so money connects, but uh
I'd rather be broke and have a whole lot of respect
It's the principal of it, I get a rush when I bust
Some dope lines oral, that maybe somebody'll quote
That's what I consider real, in this field of music
Instead of puttin' brain cells to work they abuse it
Non-conceptual, non-exceptional
Everybody's either crime-related or sexual
I'm here to make a difference, besides all the riffin'
The traps are not stickin', rappers stop flippin'
For those who pose lyrical but really ain't true I feel

Their time's limited, hard rocks too",Time's Up [Bare Bone Radio],1994
O.C.,"You lack the minerals and vitamins, irons and the niacin
Fuck who that I offend, rappers sit back I'm bout to begin
bout foul talk you sqwak, never even walked the walk
More less destined to get tested, never been arrested
My album will manifest many things that I saw did or heard about 
or told first hand, never word of mouth
What's in the future for the fusion in the changer?
Rappers are in danger, who will use wits to be a remainder
When the missile is aimed, to blow you out of the frame
Some will keep their limbs and, some will be maimed
The same suckers with the gab about, killer instincts
but turned bitch and knowin damn well they lack
In this division the conniseur, crackin your head with a 4 by 4
Realize sucka, I be the comin like Noah
Always sendin you down, perpetratin facadin what you consider
a image, to me this is, just a scrimmage
I'm feel I'm stone, not cause I bop or wear my cap cocked

O.C.,"Like the dead end kids, we used to play in the streets
Never worryin' about grief, football spelled relief
Ronnie was the coach for us
See he taught us to play, almost every single day, OK
Now on Evergreen was Larry and Mike and Lon
My cousin Boo lived there too just to name a few
With Sha-rone, he's bad to the bone, Boo's little sidekick
And a bad ass mouth, he used to feist it on Harmon Street
With Zach, Leo and Ed
Me Jody and Boop by June, Rocky and then comes
Tommy and Cedric, Lamont and Greg, unique in our own right
At times we'd fight, but that's a-ight
Still, not realizin' we had love, it showed
When we played, no phony charades against
One another, now while I write this song
It's like some are still alive and a couple are gone

[Chorus]
We're born to live, a life to die
Life's so damn short and I wonder why
We're born to live, a life to die
Life's so damn short and I wonder why
We're born to live, a life to die
Life's so damn short and I wonder why
We're born to live, a life to die
Life's so damn short and I wonder why

As kids, you're overlookin' death
It didn't seem important or serious, it just seems curious
It was about, wakin' to a bowl of cereal
Cartoons on Saturday's, karate flicks, and like
Ridin' your skateboard, or bicycle
And went as deep as Killa Joe on the corner drinkin' Ripple
Plus, Puerto Rican kids on the block were cool
We got along, we all knew right from wrong
By far, we got a dose that life was hard
A Spanish we were close with, was killed by a car
Shocking, Alberto was hit, on the block and
Death was spontaneous, his moms was clockin' him 'cross the street
He just received an award
For Little League baseball like an hour before, plus
He didn't even get to see the summer set in
Dyin' all young at the age of seven
It opened up my eyes small that the flesh was weak
As a kid, thinkin' shit like that was mad deep, peep it

[Chorus]

Now when somebody is gone, that's when you realize how close you was
How close you are, like a star
Real deep it takes time to heal
And still from time to time you wish you could find the way to forgive
And let him know you forgave
But they can't feel six feet deep inside the grave
What's left, but attend his wake, believin' if it was you
He'd do it for old time's sake, damn
I'm disturbed, by the news when I was told I was sittin'
Knowin' damn well Boo ain't bullshittin'
My life flashed like big bills of cash
And good times we had, now it's all so sad
One of my childhood pals hit the road
When you take, to the streets, then you die, by the code
But in this case, who knows what went down?
Bottom line is wishin' that he still was around
Now he found a spot in my heart, or should I say lobotomy
Mike, know you're trapped inside of me
And every other brother in Bush wick
Who rushed to your side thick, all down with the click
Yeah, God Bless he laid to rest
Call him Mike Boogie, that's what describes the nigga best

""Police be clocking me"" -> KRS-One - Hip Hop vs Rap

[Verse 1]
I make wax, I pay tax, I don't show cracks
Something to kick back, you callin' on dispatch
The deal you'd did with a dealer you the distel
Took Gladys from his box now he's burried in the system
You see me comin' out of my building
All types of days and nights, wondering if I got a nine to five
Those I always do, so you cry I spy
A flashin' goes smile, you in the corner of my eye
Walkin' I feel the hawk over right the side
It's over from the act, lyricist start to walk live
Shop lift or what, then I start to jog
Hearin' speed accelerated from the J-8's car
The sirens sound violent they expect more not ready
I'm on the stoop my man named Little Eddy we started laughing
He's nextdoor from me, is a house that has traffic like drugs are free
But I'm a new face in a new place of a melon race
Gets black in 'em makes a good fellon case
And that's not so and I get mad cause everywhere I go
Long as I'm dark walkin clarks in my village tho

""Police be clocking me"" -> KRS-One - Hip Hop vs Rap (8X)

[Verse 2]
They clocking, shocking and knocking me
Wantin' a reason for whocking me
But I ain't committin' no crime
Soon as they stoppin me O.C. roll if a dolo went solo
Cop car come screechin in my presence in a second yellin ""Freeze!""
I'm scared how can I stop hopped over a fence
Runnin' frantic sendin' O.C. into a panic
I 'fused to be rock me hardly you won't scar me beatin' me down
Yellin' smellin old and coffee sender
Fuckin' hard, but soft to a stick
Some cops are cool and some are just downright dicks
You won't in 68 me in a choke hole, death mockin' me
So for that even my dousin keep clockin me
Check my abdominal check how I'm fashion
Nice sticks if you don't had the same type of fashion
Two blocks behind me two jakes who want blue and white
Pair glocks equals 32 shots I think not

""Police be clocking me"" -> KRS-One - Hip Hop vs Rap (8X)

[Verse 3]
What for!? Is it my be	-Boy presence mixed with mature
Is it the way Stone and me comb the city in a Benz
Legitimate plus without ends
Paperwork was right, we sat aside a red light
Givin' dirty looks, I guess assumin' we were crooks
Scopin' the car, tags of the par, rims shinin' in ya face
With the tires all along and I dig it
All young is my complection been through gettin' stress
So I know you understand what I manifest
A friend of me, uncool, that squares a black cop Jones
All crooked with fat rides and homes
Watch your own BB with the APP on your side
And corrupt cats corriscatin on the margin
Next time read me my rights check out the snipes
Look behind ya on the wall sucker I rocks mics

O.C.,"It's like many knuckleheads who want to do the eye to eye contact 
Not knowing O.C. is ready for combat 
I tried to ignore the son with the advacant attitude 
Stick in my face for gratitude  yeah 
Just the other night on the train 
Me my cousin Boo was on our way up to club Galaloo 
I kind of had a fight so we took our 25's and that 
We had juice with the bouncer on the inside 
Mad Jamaicans faking nigga fronting knowing they're Americans 
We fronted us off from the embarrassing 
Some old poor face fellow try to star me in the eye and give a wammy 
He almost caught a grammy 
Just when I was about to reach for my glock 
 Boo whispered to me yo! 
""O O let it slide"" 
It ain't worth smoking a minute worth of lead 
So to break the tension I 
Broke him in the head 

I let it slide, I let it slip on by 
Giving you one last try to kill it with the eye 
New day same shit occurred in this time 
I was asked what I was looking at not knowing he was grassed 
This spark the beef and 
I was gonna finish it off but turns out 
This nigga was soft he got 
Afraid from the way about the stance glancing to my left and right 
Put a basket a man insight 
He'll see the whole thing if I decide to do a buckwild move 
So what I turn it in shall I choose, ha! 
Fire my steel and take the chance 
Of being bagged and ship up north for a long long ? 
I ain't for it so I flash the cloud 
He saw the nickle plate 
Almost having a day to die 
I wonder why 
Chumps want to pick on I 
They be like setting it off 
And I be letting it slide 
I don't know what they be seeing 
But one time in a conflict 
I flip, turn into an unstable human being 

I let it slide, I let it slip on by 
Giving you one last try to kill it with the eye 

When I'm flowing with my girl I feel it the most 
Beef coming so close like a champagne toast 
On the train, in the city, down the way 
Down her way, I take it upon myself and say niggas is gay 
What you trying to prove? 
Can't move him out and with a stare 
But when a brother pull a trunk and sink it ain't fair 
Two wrongs don't make a right 
But the philosophy of a fight, fella 
Used to prolong you life, I 
Rolled like it was enemy 
Why would you pretend to be 
Some motherfucker men is to fight to kill Kenney, I 
Be rappin' son's trying flamboyant and 
Put on a smurf 'cause you staring is annoying and 
No matter how much I try to avoid noise from feeling in with bad day 
Starring in my grill again 
Or try to hypnotize with the eye starring 
Retinified be tearsful, to your family lives a day 
No fronting because you couldn't stop my glock so 
Time ran out 'cause you punch your own glock 

I let it slide, I let it slip on by 
Giving you one last try to kill it with the eye",Let It Slide,1994
O.C.,"I say one for the fam, two for good judgment
Bad luck to trife, good luck to stay above it
Trial and error, O.C.'s out to sever
Your game respect neglect not
You work hard for the revenue instead of on the avenue, babblin
I'd rather be accomplishin, makin moves, travellin
Insight is right on time let's do it
Funk struck again with the disco fluid
I protrude out of your skin like thorns irritatin MC's
Cause they don't make, songs like these
Mister, it's the man most lease to excel
Long time ago, many thought I'd fall like a domino, no
Now your face is chump, cause I've summed up
The somethin most high, not a mountain to a bum

I'm comin with fluent, rhythm, calm yet storm
Unleashin my speech to each and every one
I wake up in the mornin, get up then I'm yawnin
Glad to be alive to another day's dawnin
Some blessed be otherwise, they despise
Cause they can't handle what's word from the wise
I don't stress who I measure up to or who's fond of O's
Cause what you build I knock down for my condos
Upon those, those words I speak
More or less my best, just to say the least
Foundation laid, what gives
You ask would I sass regardless, O.C. lives

One time, it's a check your life record
Yeah peep the method it's a smooth kind of effort
With guidelines to put your hand on your chin and think
Ears listen before you say a record ain't mink
Hard work involves what evolves around O
I try to keep it moderate if that's how I thought of it
I break beats down lashin, with the voice
Choice words I'ma say, only spoken when I'm moist
It's a vibe, coincidin with the rhythm
Choice words to follow, for suckers to swallow

Let the rhyme enter twine like a vine

Will I persevere on the mic like sports?
Take me in stride, O.C.'s worth listening
Watch the tricks of a hoe who is a fixin
Tender eyes, they only leadin' to a hard-on
Touchin' tongue stick, two to be a part on
I max relax smooth it out like a sax
One of my goals is to make fat stacks
Then I, flip the money to astound this your business

I gave it a test for the rhyme lynguistics
Honey want to kiss, gotta remove the lipstick
I dig lips with, mad jewel juices
Soft and lickable, nah, rough and ruthless
Because of many people I think denied
Gas in my tank takin' me for a ride
But I'm alright now, smooth as the turn pipe

Meditate, daily I do, so why sort
Things I consider in my mind is deep thought

By the way, do me a favor
Give it a chance, if a nigga has flavor
Years surpass now trained and it's over
I'm bein' intoxicated, now I'm kinda sober
Persons serve for purpose like workers
If this clowns is makin' Hip Hop a circus
Me and my architect, mark my sweat
Bring up the engine, better yet a Corvette
Thoughts I search 'em like a sub's emergin'
Some subjects never been touched like a virgin
Urgin' MC's, do way of my 'raft
I'm destroyin' all things to go through my path
It doesn't matter the sex type
O to see now, niggaz gettin' done by the ? in freestyle
Rhythms are constantly switchin' and changin'
Name is O.C., I wrote and arranged this
Fluctuation I add it like seized it
Before it was missed
Now more than a breeze and
Poetically astoundin', round and soundin'
My brain was paused to a beat, boomin' and bouncin'
Edo waves kickin' with the kicks asided
You must go inside and exhail, divide it

Crushin' competition, dustin' oppostions
Down the toilet on a flushing composition
Describes a week, and for I can speak
Myself against the man, with the true mystique I got
So many ways to flip phrases, flip thoughts
Passin' licks over the head of my foes
Fits I'm givin' 'em it's a living
If I don't want to take a ride with ya
Then I can't be driven
Bound for town with a raw sound
Seemin' to be lackin' lust in front, my line of MC's
Skits get done by the misfit
Doin' gimmicky shit, followin' the leader from a trend hit
O.C. got it goin' so like a sweater
Better believe it, that I get it busy to the letter
Pure and thick, that's so premature ejaculated
And if you had a girl you wouldn't be masturbatin'
Masceradin' your personafication as a lyrical law
When you just not fascinatin'
Nigga, you need to stop flexin' stop vexin' what you not
And sure 'bout what you got

Things I consider in my mind is deep thought

By the way, do me a favor
Give it a chance, if a nigga has flavor
Years surpass now trained and it's over
I'm bein' intoxicated, now I'm kinda sober
Persons serve for purpose like workers
If this clowns is makin' Hip Hop a circus
Me and my architect, mark my sweat
Bring up the engine, better yet a Corvette
Thoughts I search 'em like a sub's emergin'
Some subjects never been touched like a virgin
Urgin' MC's, do way of my 'raft
I'm destroyin' all things to go through my path
It doesn't matter the sex type
O to see now, niggaz gettin' done by the ? in freestyle
Rhythms are constantly switchin' and changin'
Name is O.C., I wrote and arranged this
Fluctuation I add it like seized it
Before it was missed
Now more than a breeze and
Poetically astoundin', round and soundin'
My brain was paused to a beat, boomin' and bouncin'
Edo waves kickin' with the kicks asided
You must go inside and exhail, divide it

[Chorus: x2]

Crushin' competition, dustin' oppostions
Down the toilet on a flushing composition
Describes a week, and for I can speak
Myself against the man, with the true mystique I got
So many ways to flip phrases, flip thoughts
Passin' licks over the head of my foes
Fits I'm givin' 'em it's a living
If I don't want to take a ride with ya
Then I can't be driven
Bound for town with a raw sound
Seemin' to be lackin' lust in front, my line of MC's
Skits get done by the misfit
Doin' gimmicky shit, followin' the leader from a trend hit
O.C. got it goin' so like a sweater
Better believe it, that I get it busy to the letter
Pure and thick, that's so premature ejaculated
And if you had a girl you wouldn't be masturbatin'
Masceradin' your personafication as a lyrical law
When you just not fascinatin'
Nigga, you need to stop flexin' stop vexin' what you not
And sure 'bout what you got

[Chorus]",Word...Life [Remix],1994
O.C.,"You tried your best to show me 
That you really cared 
Said if there were days I was lonely 
Just call you - you'd be there 

You tried your best convinced me 
That you understand 
And if I need someone to hold on to 
You wanted to be the man 

Then I knew it was true 
All the feelings that I had inside for you 
I could not deny 
Though many times I tried 

Give me a little more time 
I need to make up my mind 
'cause you know I'm in two minds 
I want to be more than your friend 
Ooh I just can't pretend any longer 
Feelings getting stronger 

Give me a little more time

You've been there when I've needed 
You've never let me down 
I just don't know how I'd cope 
Without you being around 

Feelings have grown between us 
Though friends we have been 
Don't you think it complicates things 
Or is it just me 

Then I knew it was true 
All the feelings that you had 
I shared them too 
I could not deny 
Though many times I tried 

Give me a little more time

Give me a little more time 
I need to make up my mind",Give Me a Little More Time,1995
O.C.,"Intro: 
Mmm mmm yeah East coast no doubt 
Hip hop is somethin you live rap is somethin you do 

Verse One: 
Sorta distorted yo that's a fact 
Bad news gave a nigga in the mind contact 
I react on blues then use it within 
Blend conscious thoughts to make man mortal men 
see right ways to shell out this thing hip hop 
I pledge O.C. will only season the crops 
And never stop side drops or shot, I'm fiendin 
Covering more ground than news on CNN 
Being in the state of vast consumption in this game 
it's like drugs only quantity is run throughout 
Quality is walking through the valley of the reaper 
True deceivers are coming through your receivers 
Solid foundation to me is the true meaning of hardcore 
We need a little bit more... 

Chorus: 4X (layered on samples) 
Love and affection 
""What I represent is MC's gone mad"" --> Q-Tip 

Verse Two: 
I'm living in the time where life be a buck 
more worth than a child this rap shit suck 
Very few or should I say a handful of MC's 
Talk live, calling themselves kickin life, indeed 
I listen and take a look around only seein who's 
all about frontin and who's profilin 
While my glock I had, guess what I forsaw 
True for now I'm not surprised we didn't rise not at all 
Too many clicks for dolo, weak hitting solos 
My scrolls, they always paint visual photos 
O.C. worth more than a million 
Building nuff respect on the circuit of rap like Sicilians 
You might see the be	-boy when I walk New York 
Crew of brothers recognized so I stopped to talk 
Even the girls be hawkin sassi-fraskin askin 
What's going on and am I still rapping 
Things will change with hope galore 
But when it comes to rap, we need a little bit more... 

Chorus 
Verse Three: 
Big you hold your head and God bless your wife 
Got your little baby girl so I know she's alright 
I strike the mic anytime smashing yours 
Word are wise with wisdom with the width of a wall 
and way describe I prescribe antidotes 
Curing, reassuring my lyrical notes 
Make an impact a fact on the backs of men 
Magnified to the fullest magnificent 
Brilliant, my composition is efficiently prone 
to set fire to a waste and char your ass to the bone 
Figure, I trigger, bigger, bold bad men 
Come against O you'll be walking away a sad man 
Miles of red tape had me stunted for growth 
but when I took off on wax I maxed the globe 
Didn't happen so far, respect be just building 
Watch for the devils in the forms of chameleons 
Kick the raw slow down on the score 
Think before you write or find yourself falling 
Final calling, you're spreading infection 
When it comes to rap, we need a little bit more... 

Chorus",What I Represent,1996
O.C.,"CHORUS:

We just can't go wrong
You got me hypnotized, mesmorized (mesmorized)

What you want, I shoot a line, thinkin maybe we can talk, cause
The first time I laid eyes on you, boo
I seen into the future, you and I true blue, huh
High school, eleventh grad, my-my you fly
I was struck, you gave a go, we took it slow
Every Friday you mad it my day, comin to know
You was pure inside out, and not just a ho
Oh my god, my folks takin to you, now it's official
If other girls would call the crib, my mommy she would blow the whistle
I'ma, past the fatuation love is in effect, now
What you call sex, I say 'yo baby I'm stressed out'
We hooked a bond that's so strong knowin

CHORUS (3x) [verse 2 cuts in]

Many years in the mix now
We get a crib together, our love is tough as leather
Always by your side like a shadow, but not narrow
You be like my queen, OC I'll be your pharoahe
Handle each other with care, we're
Inseperable, none come second to you
We imbelish in trust, we might fuss and cuss
Cause we're like stainless steel baby, we can never rust
Blessed with God, for grantin my soulmate to life
Commonlaw, 9 years, you officially my wife, ooh
Do what you want, I don't worry bout fools
Cause I know know it's me you're comin home to, true
Teenage love turned into somethin strong knowin

CHORUS (3x)

Always and forever, forever always
So much temptation but I don't pickup strays
Case in fact, I'd rather be many a groupies
Lookin fine like I realized they just floosies
Toured the world from Amsterdam to Japan
Shot at me on tour, hooker tried to play a man, now
Thought about my girl, my moms and my pops
If it wasn't for the cops I'd be layin in a box
Dyin in vain, causin whole lotta pain
Tombstone mighta read 'Gave it what all for the fame'
And when I'm away call my woman every day
I figure why fuck up a good thing over one night's lay, I say
Gettin past all the sour times we had
From others intervening talkin nothing but trash, but
We got a bond that's so strong knowin

CHORUS [fades until end]",Can't Go Wrong,1997
O.C.,"Yeah
Mmmm

Echoes in the halls yes, when I arrive on the set - what?
Blessin all that came to see me rock my cut
Such a man like me receivin attention must be chosen
like a bangin body chickenhead, posin for a flick
Flashbulbs poppin in the air
Floatin the stage, I'm movin like a black Fred Astaire - smooth
The momentum of the bass and treble, levels on point
Bonus to ride, the microphone
it's O.C. slash, Mush shine communicatin for the masses
Puttin my finger against NASA
When I die, bronze my mic, preserve it for newcomers
to visit my gravesite like a shrine
Rappers'll line up faithfully, just to get
a handful of dirt from the plot occupied by

Chorus:

The Chosen One, beyond the Moet and the Cristal
The Son of a King and a Queen, I'm a gifted child
All bow to me like the image of God, Supreme Being
Get you to the eyes worth seeing

Influenced; but not by the ancient ruins of rap
A large percent of y'all fell into a trap
Trendsetter share with y'all a veteran's nightmare
Not for you to follow it but try and stand clear, bust it
Bein intelligent, means you a sucka
Bein wild as hell, means you a smart motherfucker WRONG
Analyze songs nowadays
Most rappers gunsprayed or hustled from night to day - fiction
I deciphered lots of rhymes, only to find
false info, just to see what it meant to Oh
Not for-real; no skill MC's
Mostly all under twenty, and I find it funny
That's why the seed was born to lead assume
positions like Noah, all aboard the arc with

Chorus: repeat 2X

I'm comin from an Egyptian Mola story, rarely told
Back in the mix of things to break the mold
Good as gold mind ya leave negative thoughts behind ya
Type of how I'm livin be more potency than ganja
Oh Period; when you see my face I'm serious
Move with the mystique of a cheetah, mysterious
Dominate jungles when I walk the floor rumbles
The baddest motherfuckers - I make their attitudes humble
My aura shine bright like sunlight, in Farenheight temperature
Stylee's, you file these
Most is type of scriptures, follow me is for reference
Other MC's make no kind of sense
Oh freeze foes and bleed souls and leave those stunned
Descended on the planet, you're in confusion
Pick ten, subtract five then, subtract four
Watch the Sun leave a shadow on the man that's raw
I be

The Chosen One",The Chosen One,1997
O.C.,"Check out the scheme of a dream, thick fog all around me
Standing in a tunnel of blood, hounds surround me
Shadow of a child, my eyes visualize and figure
And as you walked backwards the shadow grew bigger
Temptation made me curios to follow it
All fear in my heart, at that point I done swallowed it
State like trance as I reach out my hand
You wore an overcoat robe, face was disclosed
Now was this a dream or reality
I was about to become one of Satan's fuckin fatalities
In silence, I hear the wings of a black crow flappin
The bird lands, then appears a man
Very sleek in physique, stood  about six feet
Dispute was jet black I had to step back
His dimeanor wasn't pure, I knew this for sure
He had a diseased look that the world couldn't cure
I'm forzen, the fear returned to my body
Heart pumpin so fast, I thought I was goin into cardiac arrest
I wake up in a cold sweat, wifey sleepin on my left sound asleep
I peep around the room then I make a sudden jest
A feather from a black crow was beside my pillow
Was it a sign from God to repute for the things that I did in my lifetime
Now my soul's on the line
I'm puzzled, spark up a Newport
Then I take a fall in hell it's the cancer
Then I try and find an answer

CHORUS: (2x)

My wisdom that I'm droppin is-
Is somethin like a doctor and
Necessary like oxygen
I'm seein who's my opposite
And who's my aid in life
So let's attract and repell
Third rate government they tryin to seize the world

Day like a rose, the wind is blowin hard against the window
Pull up the blinds there sits the crow
I back up fast heart beatin massive
Lost my breath, collapsin fallin on the mattress
I went into a state of unconsciousness
Open my eyes up, I'm layin on the dark street
Leaves blowin in the breezes, Jesus
I on the street like a nightmare
I take flight, a bird through the air
While I'm wingin it I see all sorts of chaos
Dead bodies, burned buildings turned over cars
Uh-uh, seein visions of an all out war
Territory factors, picture escape from New York
Gun fire, blomb flowin, nerve gas a-flowin
Just imagine whole race of Harlem gaurds showin
Realizin I was havin out-of-body experience
Return to my physical and wake up tense
Layin in the hospital as I figured the riddle
G-O-D was throwin at me paranormally so
Givin sight beyond sight about the world we know
A preminition that I saw through the eyes of a pro",The Crow,1997

You may never find a MC well orchestrated like a symphony 
Some'll go down in history, some in infamy 
The infamy will be somewhat a mystery 
As long as my name O.C. live on through infinity 
My identity, will ring bells in all facilities 
From fans to enemies I'm the antidote and remedy 
I'ma philosophize, analyze, no question 
If I die I'ma return like Jesus' resurrection 
I'm a blessin to the rap game, my claim to fame is when 
I disappear reappear, I put rappers to shame 
Plain and simple, in common English, what I distinguish 
The meanest lyric flamethrower your career's over 
Finesse a mic Casanova, Don Juan or MC 
The people need a change, this rap shit is deranged

Material items and shit
Beware motherfuckers
Word up, don't let it getcha, you know?
This shit ain't nothing
One time, check him out

Yo, you live the life of a hustle 
Not sympathetic to a user
Making cats fast taking trips to Bermuda
Elegant women, all lovely and feminine 
Houses with arces, and big pools for swimming in
Big transactions, swiping all the action
Driving a Benz and Lex, you be like maxing
Jewels be on truck shit
Rims with fat clusters
Diamonds on your teeth, shining shimmers and lusterous
And God's hanging sideways, holding your head high
Cruising through a block, so you past a dreads
Now the dreads are looking hard at your face Mr. Fly Guy
Unaware tonight their gonna do a fucking drive by
Go home watch a sci-fi flick, with a chick, till
10pm, now it's time for you to dip
Go round up a few men hold a classified
Info inside, hand picked these nigga's you confided in the shippment
To pick up quick, click off Clyde's
Seven numbers for you if their gonna demise 
A scheme of betrayal
Guess in your valley you was higher then self
Work, short from another fly guy
By george i think he's got it 
Chicks gooms and lump sums
Trickering 5-0 wild to be like dumb dums
One of the few never having a heart
Issue was smart some ass with it 
Came to cash don't give a shit
Attitude more money, and more money
Dog days bright, and more sunny
4 in the morning drinking Seneca apple juice in the rent a car
Neighborhood star, got riddled and scarred

Style like somethin the microphone fiend would spark
Sort of reminiscing, of how it used to go down in the parks
Equipment ropped off, you can hear the vagas echo for miles and breath
Bass pounds the asphalt
Thunder vibration shake like a tremble from a earthquake and
O.C. a classic in the making, mental make thoughts
My physical form words
Hot in my mouth like a joust, no doubt
Some a phenomenon, mic technician, electrician
Spit the mic down the middle like an el producto
And throughout the resin, then asapoltin this shit
Gift to gather a rhyme, make rap a staired son
The way I do this, switch up the fluid
So smooth you want to persuie it
I'm raw like underground sewage you
This shit for insight? Well I'm back, never was gone
What I right, be tighter than pin stripes
Born by mob boss, my flause in affect on the mic
Keep it tight, with out a fight is raw, it's only right

[sample from live event]
I know it's hot, we hot too
You ready to throw down, we ready to have a party
So if ya ready to have a party, make some noise!

Any mic I hold it in the grip of my palm
I wave it over the crowd
Dictatin shit like Genghis Khan
Nonchalantly deliver the flow like drug traffic schoolin
Bringin samatics to this rap shit
Bonafied, mic set you can't see me on it
Master the art, so now I just flaunt it
Born to live, a life and die until then
Imma keep on writin the slick rhymes with the pen
Take the cherry from a tree, like a virgin havin innocence
Bust my nuts, bringin rhymes to live like Genesis
But ritical renaissance
In death there's a flautless
Tearin shit up when it comes to me pickin up a cordless
One of New York's finest, on this trip I co-incide with be	 Minus
Bringin out the best in me, we formulatin like a recipe

Microphone's I melt down, slap crowns, push em out of bounds
Crush ya crowd, as I lay my third verse down
Because, this is what I want, to gain control of that position
It's only right, that I follow through compition
Be warning me, homocide rhymes or mad rounds
To get flass or pencil hurt, battin me down
Contents flex text expert, since my born date
5/13/71 like a stick bin, injection
Inside ya blood stream, digest what I manifest
O.C., you best by me, others are mediocre like
I slam the earth like a meteor right
'cause I'mma take mine, leavin you face down in the puddle
Blow up like a shuttle, when I give you my rebuttle
Frame of mind, across state lines
Await the taste, me like fine wines from Avidian
For those who want to select cyphers to cyphers stash

Smooth or rough as the ocean
Sometimes it slip away and I lose devotion
My judgement get cloudy
Then I want to get rowdy
Like Arabia
Terrorize like Saudi Arabia
My avons reflects my mood swing
Switch colors like a mood ring
Wifey telling me good things
So I won't strain
Got grey hairs, and only been here 25 years
Shed tears for niggaz I knew for life, now lifeless
When you died to us, was like the Iranian crisis
I took it hard like a flick slow mo' breathing
Prophetize dot of a book______summer night's dreaming
Semi-wet as I write this
Dragging the cancer sticks
Smoke thick, Hennessey shots to my wig
Half naked while I jot this
Lounging in my boxers
Dreaming Tahiti, even settle for the Bahamas
I get a boner
When am asleep dreaming that I'm louging on a yaucht

Reality I wake up to
Feels like I woked up to a cloud filled room with angel dust
It's just the...

Stress, frust, make me want to bust
Make me want to cuss
I lust, for living a life a righteousness
With invisible forces stand in my way, keeping my mind off course

I'm searching for the light like Noah
The flame combust
Upon the bush forseeing my future like the Nova
Pushing for the brighter side of living a life
A better time pouring rhymes like wine
Till my cup run it over
Temptation on my shoulder
I'm growing colder then a polar bear
Thinking about a bank hold up
I fall upon my lap, and rest my head upon my knee caps
Is it a crime that I be dreaming about the G's black?
Freeze for a minute, gotta take control of my life
Gotta hold it like a knife
Must have more then a slice you know
Frustration, mental masturbation, (confusion)
Life is love living till I'm right be in a illusion
Seclusion, seeing me is rare
I rather attain stacks mack the islands on a plane ready for lift off
And spend grands, sipping exotic juice
Laying in the shade and shores
At a fly resort, on my cell contact the D.I.T.C. cohorts
Talking to the God Finesse
We tight like indians with a mohawk
And so on,
Conversation going on do the math
Dreaming I leave the___ Champagne bubble bath
Reality I wake up to
Feels like I woked up to a cloud filled room with angel dust
It's just the...

Stress, frust, make me want to bust
Make me want to cuss
I lust, for living a life a righteousness
With invisible forces stand in my way, keeping my mind off course

But time seem to go slow
Busting your ass to go from a amateur to a pro
Low budget feeling inside no more can you score
Bad and good fight inside just like a war
(Slavery later foundation for my nation centuries before 
 Final Call be the New World Order) 
2 K's on it's way, no time for play
So I prey to God got me on a path of righteuos ways
Even though i get stressed, and frustrated
The best time for me to bless a rhyme is to put the pen through a test
(Yeah I want the riches
 The misses on my side on a pool, with the night
 When blitzed, and magic like a grand wizard)
Official O.C. a two syllable sound
Three six incomplete like the earth was round
And on that note keep hope alive
Striving to rise
From the inner soul
Seeing through the eyes of a crow you know
Slow pacing walk forth is only right
separating the cause
From another man ""Far From Yours""
(Going for mine still coming off a two year hiatus)
And in that time nigga's bit my shit like alligators
It's alright though this rap shit is stress for us
It makes you feel like your in a hallway robust with angel dust
Reality i wake up to
My old dad once told me how you live your life is all on you son

(Chorus 2X)
Stress, frust, make me want to bust
Make me want to cuss
I lust, for living a life a righteousness
With invisible forces stand in my way, keeping my mind off course",Jewelz,1997
O.C.,"Penicillin on wax, the cure for rap
Crooklyn Dodger number two back on the map
Perhaps you thought I was gone, well surprise nigga
Not physically, but I'm a massive figure

Al Pacino status, the baddest, exotic
Repetition like a automatic, can't stop it
High floatin', po satin' like coke snortin'
When I see a fetus, moms thought about abortin'

Important, am I? Gotta ask myself
But then I think twice like a Gemini
Authentic, percentage, calculating my mind state
Eat foods and fit it

Bizarre pa, ain't it, flow you through like draino
Lava, from a volcano
Scorchin', torchin' the microphone I lost it
Poppin'

Freddie Foxxx with the twin millies
Burn a temperillo
Aiyo Foxxx fuck these niggas
Slice 'em up like an ox pop

Yeah, okay, it's time to bring these rap cats from Fantasy Isle
I bring it to these fake niggas with a quick and a smile
You know my style, America's most feared entertainer
Yeah, from New York to Cali, I'm called an acid Rainer

While you frontin' like ballin', son I stays in the mix
Same bullets in your burner since '76
Act like you can't tell, shit be live as hell
Bustin' so much shots
When my shells hit the ground it sound like ""Rock the Bells""

Call me Bumpy Knuckles 'cause my hands be swell
From knockin' niggas out from the lies they tell
Oh well, I bet you feel me all up in ya chest
I make the saucest nigga catch a body blame it on stress

And if he snitch, I bail him out and murder his bitch
And then sedate her with my four pound clap
Shit's only rap but I'm livin' like that
So when while niggas be talkin' dogs and walkin' like cats

Niggas mouths were gettin' way too fat
But O.C. and big Fred Oxxx, we bought to bring it back
""Let's go back""
""I'm tellin' it just like that""

We be money under ground but you can't get none
Cause if you step into my round, you be one dead son
We get love where niggas be scared to come
And we got a whole lot to give, but you don't want none

Any nigga play high post, I'm runnin' over
O.C. weigh tons like a fuckin' Range rover
(Tellin' niggas to they face that the fassad is over
Now it's time for this real nigga shit, can you feel this?)

No question, we manifestin', what we feel
Bust up in your session, smack niggas up like adolescence
(Like a D&D, I can't see a gang, no motherfuckin' body
Seein' me that's just pure fantasy)

True indeed son, we ain't the one
While niggas goin' out like that, we bring it on like Scarface
(That's means murder case, I bring highs to any base
Disrespect the profession)

Mean that real niggas on the mic, bringin' it back
It's mad potent, like good crack, it's type addicted
All up in ya mind, you don't want hard times

We be money under ground but you can't get none
Cause if you step into my round, you be one dead son
We get love where niggas be scared to come
And we got a whole lot to give, but you don't want none

O.C.,"Uhh
Yeah, why'know
Shit is wild, heheh
Can't complain though, I'm alive
Healthy and allathat, knahmsayin?
Just tryin to do my thang
Praise to all

Bust it, that nigga Slick Rick said
I waited long time sweatin it
I got jerked but now I'm gettin it
Hazy like asthma bizarre disaster
Stress almost held me down from bein a master
The faster, preacher, poet, a teacher
""It's been so long"" like Monifah
Believe that, I'm needed, in rappin, I breathe this
Some pick up a microphone and can't even achieve this
Oscar award winning your shit I'm bored with it
Stop copy-catting son (why?) cause your dog did it
Get your own lingo, make up your own jingle
Ten years later you be bitin my single
Primo, take it Downtown, Swing it
Intervenin on the board, sensimil steamin, yeah
Catch the vibe like a tribal dance
In the clubs on the low with the be	-boy stance
Money rubbin with a shorty got bumped by a chump
Tell him, 'Step off, I'm doin the Hump'
Yeah

I say it's my world, and I won't stop
and if you stand in my way you bound to get dropped

Some wish that I was gone cause they know I'ma win
In a minute I 'll be makin six G's times ten
I'm the computer, printin out data take notes
then analyze the information and press send
Freaky like porno, Ron Jeremy saw no
obstacle or pussy to stop him from bonin a hoe
Me and the mic double trouble
Chicks look at us like twins, all lovable and huggable
Prognosis, on the, mic I choke out
Had the same effects from coughin blowin smoke out
Architect, rap technician, man listen
It's no doubt you gonna pump this in your system
My skills ill, and all of that above
Confidence, I'm not worried bout a street buzz
I'm O.C., who you?  I never heard of ya
Get out my face 'fore I turn into a motherfuckin murderer
I want the green like indo, a mansion, a car
A wife who's never been a bimbo
Too much to ask well to me that's simple
want to retire on a yacht called the S. S. Minnow

I say it's my world, and I won't stop
And if you stand in my way, you bound to get dropped
(repeat 4X)

Top choice, this here nigga got poise
Ain't a man alive who could stop my noise
I snatch a star from the sky, spark up your lye
You stand astounded wonderin how I did it
Now you're star struck, like I truck gold
Treatin me like a nigga havin a million records sold
Now a starchild, phenmonen like the X-Files
Rappers know I'm comin so they go in exile
Czar in this rap shit, comin on your mattress
Microphone fiend I make beats do backflips
Fear me like genocide, serious
How I do it through your stereo, mysterious
O.C. do demolition, nil competition
Like robot Kong on a destroy mission
A matter of life and death you try to fight for breath
I snatch your heart from a slice through your chest
Who the best, from New York to Bogota
Who got face thinkin they scare me with a scar, shit
What I be bringin is a terrible sight
A performance never again performed on the mic

I say it's my world, and I won't stop
And if you stand in my way, you bound to get dropped

O.C.,"Hey love...
Yeah...

Shopping in the city one day
On my way, met a redbone by the name of Stronjay
Five foot six, body thick, hair silky
She could make the hardest man melt and turn milky
Bugged out shit, one eye was hazel, one was blue
Lips fully packed as my attention stayed glued
Upon her outline, I cased it with my mind
Saying to myself, 'this sugar be a dime'
Yo sugar, let's have a drink, and um, talk some more
Proceed to grab my bag, and then we exit the store
Walking down the street, men is staring with amazement
Treatment something like black ???????????????
Anyhow, the star and me hit a sushi bar
Told her that I never had sushi before
Ordered saki that I already endeavored in Japan
Reached 'cross the table then I grabbed her hand
Why your man let you walk around solo like this?
My chinky eyes looked upon her as I gave her hand a kiss
This most mesmerizing young thing I must say
Echoes in my thoughts since I met you that day

Chorus:
Stronjay, a beautiful thing I must say
Her body got curves like waves in The Bay
Lips light smooth, just like Alize
The bizomb, I couldn't see her blowing my way

Stronjay responds, men only want her 'cause she rich
Her beeper start buzzin' so we pullin' out a flip
In the back of my mind, I'm sayin' 'yes, go ???????'
Find a nigga rich in New York's one in a million
She wanted to leave, I said 'Is this the end?'
Then she gave me an invitation back to her crib
I never surprise, I flag a cab, she says 'un uh'
My car's round the block in the parking garage
Got the vehicle, ???? the speed like Batman out of his cave
500 Benz whippin' in the wind
Destination 57 Park Ave. south
Turn my face a little, wipe the slob from my mouth
The building was immaculate inside with marble floors
We hit the elevator, she slips out of her draws
I'm shocked like goodies and I don't know how to take 'em
Titties in my face and like a gun I must face 'em
This most mesmerizing young thing I must say
Echoes in my thoughts since I met you that day

CHORUS

Top floor, penthouse suite for sure
It was classy like some type of fly furniture store
She grabbed me up and intertwined into a kiss with me
I tried taking off my clothes, she assisted me
Upon her fireplace wall is were I pushed her back
Then on the plush floor we fell; passionate collapse
She pushed me off, but the push wasn't mean
To the fridge, and came back with strawberries and whipped cream
The scene is set, but baby not just yet
'cause strawberries and whipped cream ain't complete without Moet
Foreplay; nibblin' my tongues in the air
Layin flat on her back, I love tappin' on the rear
Nuff time we spent gettin' excited, I'm delighted
Excstasy, I know honey-hun she won't fight it
She stands up, and lead me by my hand, we fled
Into a room with a king size canopy bed
This most mesmerizing young thing I must say
Satisfied O in like each and every way

Me and Premo, you know, East New York
Bushwick, Bedstuy, and all those good places

Yo
My main frame, discipline like a soldier
Ready for war, pushups get my chest swoll up
What's the deal Preme? I mean the scaze
I think I got it locked in nigga, War Games is the theme
Rap commando, what's my handle
O.C. ample to rock shit
Battle niggas who pop shit
Green bareen thought slicka
I'm one step ahead, slide thru enemy lines like a black ack figga
Camouflage, runnin thru you zone with detection
Cuz the dark skinned marksmen
Run thru your section
Flesh ya bones, physical built like titanium
Bugs cover my grill like Iranians
Ill gorilla so called killas
I fear no man but Allah, for the god is he is still in us
The Renaissance Man, I roll with real like grenade
sharp like gem stars
Cause massive scars
O.C.'s all in it, dope I've been for years
Now I'm back in the scene, and I declare War Games

I bust off like a M-16
Rippin thru screens from head to toe, blood soak up your jeans
Rap veteran, earn my stripes, faught wars
Opposing forces, would O.C. take losses?
Naucious, you feelin kinda like throwing up
Cautious, watch ya step, land rhymes blowin up
Havin a pity for foes, fuck G.I. Joe
He's a sucker, slap the taste outta wild motherfuckas
Design a rhyme, like a plan for the government
Six Million like Steve Austin, costin
Apprehended if I am
In times and my body will erupt *explosion*
M-16 tapecatin, voids filled with ammo
Bust it through a crowd, a bitch nigga sing soprano
When I get you in the square, then I end you career
All MC's lets make one thing clear
You're all the same, I will remain, fuck the fame
Feelin the lane to shoot, I declare War Games

[Chorus: x2]
I declare War Games
For niggas who flaunt figgas for more fame
Gorilla warfare, tactics issue unlimited access to ammo
With fire proof camouflage and power

Precise pinpoint it, pull it, when I cock back
This here rap will slap you and your team, and that bad bitch
Sleaves from my uncut, raw like cope
Preme dig up boys, roll up and smoke
Then toge it, back to B.I.
See I can do this, I'm professional
Too much weight to weigh any style
Dutch Master superior blend, inhale me right
Young Phillies take a toke of my rap, and get the
Willies para-
Noid, niggas all non void
Fuck with O.C., get your life destroyed
Like a marine, I'm a trained rap killing machine
Fiend to rock a mic, set from New York to New Orleans
Over seas I conquer, rough like blanca
Love to eat actors, gotta take for drama
When I flow I get comatose
In my own world
From the first verse, you saw my plan unfurl
I mean team same name, never change
My ammo is the demo competition on the mic

Who got the hardest, MC style, ever created? 
Who got celebrity, status, and is still underrated? 
Who got them two glock nines that be black and nickel plated? 
And I'll blow a nigga's chest out, to keep me motivated 
My periphreal, sees MC's, that ain't nice with these 
So all my new rivalries'll be, MC robberies 
I got these niggaz shook like, Shake-N-Bake, cook like 
I knock your punk ass out, wake you up, and I show you

F-are-E-D-D-I-E, excuse me, Bumpy Knucks 
I don't give a fuck, if it's friend or foe 
This shit is my job to let you niggaz know so don't take it personal 
When I stick this verse in you, I don't know what you gon' do 
Even if you get your crew I'll walk through the stage 
Like it's Hoe Stroll Avenue, tappin on them pockets 
Puttin tabs on your revenue, now dig this 
It's mad niggaz that be thinkin they nice with they flow 
It's mad niggaz that be frontin like they holdin some dough 
It's mad niggaz that'll challenge me and after the show 
They Don't want to Be Players no mo', like Joe 
Niggaz try and come at me, with contemporary gangsta 
Fusion I'm smashin with the simple shit I'm usin 
Bashin and bruisin, who's in charge, BUMPY 
Step up in my face I leave your forehead LUMPY

I bring the pain like a slice to your vein, fuck your fame 
Platinum and gold plate, don't hold no weight 
I be that, prophetic soul drainer, ain't a motherfucker 
In his right mind steppin in my cipher tryin to take mine 
From West coast to East I'm full-fledged 
Bust the science, niggaz better know the ledge 
O see all, I G off, enemy I spot you 
Two rhymes to my one verse, you go first 
You tasteless face it, I engrave my name in your scalp 
Like Damien, out for world domination 
Don't get me wrong, I don't represent 666 figures 
I'm just out to make figures 
Who holds the threshold, to be the best 
I crunch niggaz with my gold teeth like, vegetables 
Carnivorous deliverance, murder one nemesis 
Like a virgin, I snatch your innocence 
Talkin bank robberies when you rhyme, hold up 
You turn pussy on the mic when I roll up 
Coca-Cola, a fission like soda 
While you say butter, I'ma say Mazola 
Money folder hold a grudge cold like a polar bear 
Thug niggaz what? Blowin up spots like a SCUD 

Win the G, win the G 
Win the G, RRRRAHHHH! 

Who's that New York nigga left, that be nice like B.I. 
G.I., niggaz can't see I, see why? 
You new poppin niggaz, and you crew hoppin niggaz 
Step up in my face, and Bumpy be, 2Pa-cin niggaz 
If this bitch up in yo' heart, I'ma find it 
If you think I'm talkin to you, then just rewind it 
I got six shots behind this, even with a vest on 
Ya yellin, because I aim for the melon 
I'm a felon, and I bet you never, been in a fight 
Kinda like you really, never said shit on this mic 
So if I diss a nigga hustlin that makes me a displayer 
And if you buy my record twice, that makes you a two-payer/toupee-er 
And if your girl like Donna Karan, that makes her a DK-er 
And cause I hate your punk ass, that don't make you no playa 
Without this record business shit you niggaz is broke as fuck 
Smokin weed smokin woolies while I smoke your luck 
And while your flow needs, medical aid 
I just appear on niggaz shit, and I still get paid 
Now where's my G nigga? 

What niggaz'll think they made of steel and want to play brave? 
Bitch MC's will find theyself in the grave 
I make slaves of niggaz in ways never made 
Voice like an Ox or better yet sharp as a blade 
Intense the moment like sex when I'm bonin 
Iller than Caligula brainwashed the Romans 
I set it, let it be known, better beware, better be careful 
Who dared to oppose my phenomenal flows, how dare you? 
I smite your ass quick fast like Flash runnin past your ass 
Niggaz'll end up with whiplash 
But for the moment, I'm zonin, any opponents

Celebratin' a par-tay with a nigga named ""Life""
We twisted, kid you missed it
At a down low spot, Champagne poppin' off like a biscuit
Nuff love, word life, I'm high tonight
No brawls or fights, just men, no mice
Indecisive about things in life alone
So sometimes I speak in a hyper tone

I`m still a black cat, quick, and straight clapping dude
(Try to act rude) Play the mascott
With your clown ass ways, these days, look what your ass got
Clap, shot the body, I`m keeping it real
That cartoon ass nigga thought he was King of the Hill
That whole shit was animation, immitation
When I shipped that ass on out, like immigration
Ways of Emancipation, Proclamation
Constitutional rights, the LAST GENERATION
Your facin, M.O.P., O.G.`s 
Flippin this track with O.C.
Niggaz know we, hold this shit down for Brooklyn, nigga!
Where guns spark and leave them things smoking, nigga!

[Verse three: Billy Danze]
Hot damn! Danze shot your head
Full cooperation, I`m taking donations, ante up the bread
(Clap, clap!) You got that fat while we were gone
So the balance that I wrote like ???, we`re taking on
Put the rest of that shit in the bag
I would tear your ass to pieces, so you please don`t make me mad
(Here we go again!) You ain`t known, I control my destiny
I only got love for the thugs that`s next to me
(Who that?) Berkuance, soldier, I`m ill
*pause* I told ya, I`m real!
And I`ve been doing a double danly
Everyone ?from my crew is sayin? (Daddy, don`t fail me)
Hold on, the way that I jettin my foes may never be even
I`m one of them dudes that niggaz refuse to believe in
(Life is full of obstacles!) so keep weeping
(At 24-years old) My only goal is too keep breathing

Ya gettin' headaches from this bullshit
I'm the anesthetic to cure shit
Fuck that cut up shit I be that pure shit

And put it together that nigga O.C.'s quite clever
Always and forever no one can do it better

O.C.,"Now its the mad magician with the ill deposition
No repetition holdin down Bronx tradition
My composition simply squash the competition
Step up and get beat into submission
Cause this musician with the street intuition
7-35 fuel-injected transmission
My opposition will have to recognize my steez
Exotic trees leave a trail of scuffed up knees
So please you couldn't touch this cat with a stick
Quick to inflict tricks blaze up in the flick
Son I'm sick and you could put that on my mama
Exclamation point, quotation, comma
Lay up on the beaches when I'm down in the Bahamas
The skills go back to the days of wonderama
So pass the scama, son its time to get this money
So we can relax and recline where its sunny

I went from standin on the corner sellin cocaine
To rippin shows live on stage the hoes yellin my name
To be precise rippin mics is the light of my life
You frontin like you trife but never pulled a heist in your life
The price of my ice is sky high, I'm a fly guy
Its every thugs dream I really love cream, its in my blood stream
You mad cause I got more chicks than you, more bricks than you
More nines and extra clips than you
Where I live it ain't a nice town
You can't walk around with ice down

Why niggas playa haters
Knowin' damn well you can't fade us

You better take me out quick
'Cause I'm accurate when I bust mine
And make it count like Jordan at crunch time
Just in case I play Fishburn and double up on nines
You can never make it rain or stop my sunshine
So I keep eyes on these chumps the whole time
Take note of your technique like we scheme on dimes
Disregard your crew, fuck your heart 
Put a slug in me, it'll be marriage
'Til death do us part
Until then master this art and kill them 
With the pen that's dramatic, automatics I commit sins
Hold my head, but when I've had it I test chins
If that ain't real then feel the stainless steel
Bang'em and hang'em like they did our relatives

We all gleam, plus we feind for more cream
You got some nice players they just on the wrong team

You know the deal I represent skills
And niggas with bank reels that live to make a mil

Goin against raw dogs ya lost 
The way I simulate rhyme and rhythimatic timin
On beat off beat drunk flow here we go
Assignments handed out each individual stand out
Carryin his own clout
Phenomenal motions of rap I pose a threat
Foes I put em on a block like a hole in a pin
Lyrical genocide on the witty side
Niggas give me respect due like the pope in a synagogue
Who waitin my odds O.C. far from a fraud
You waste my time nigga so I bagged your broad

Yo, I'm in the Rover with my co-defendant, the club ended
Wolves posted out in front of the spot, I'm feelin vengeance in the air
Some kids had beef with last year
Hit my man 'cross the face with a bat now it's our tears
We caught one cat a month, Pryor lit fire to 'em
I kicked him in his dick, now his fuck game ruined
His ex-girl I'm screwin, disrespect all around the board
Homeboy, motherfuck you and yours

[Chorus: O.C.]
Doin dirt comes back ten times over
Watchin your back becomes a 9 to 5 to survive
Gettin drunk is a mistake, you gotta stay sober
Cause the, blink of an eye is all it takes to die

[O.C.]
Parked the Rover post outside the trunk, no idea
these the same kids from last year
I'm indecisive 'bout the baseball cats pulled low; for some reason
stomach had butterflies to leave but I didn't go
My dog said let's go chill by the exit
And watch the hoes come out, nah dawg, I'ma chill right here
Tryin to get a good look at these dudes
Yet the crowd was less than what I saw before, I play it cool
Get the keys from my co-D, hit the alarm
Played the driver's seat, turn on some tunes to stay calm
Lean my, skull on the headrest, heart pumpin inside of my chest
I'm wide open, no gun, no vest
Shoulda listened to the voice in my head, and told my man let's dip
A big commotion, somebody started some shit
Mouth dry from fear, unaware of homeboy and his peeps
was right behind me, creepin up from the rear

Niggaz approach from the blindside, tapped on the window
I was, smokin the indo, paranoid like a schizo
My eyes opened wide surprised, like I saw a ghost
Lookin down the barrel of toast, I sit froze
It was the kid we stomped out, with a devilish grin
From a year ago, back with his men, back for revenge
White flash, it smashed the window, hittin my chest in tempo
Ears ringin like a clash from a cymbal
Fightin to breathe, thinkin 'bout my girl and my seed
Slumped over like a parapleg', not promised to see
sunrise or my, son rise to manhood
Will he feel abandoned?  FUCK
I tried fightin, people lookin in the car frightened
like I ain't gon' make it... damn...

(Never thought he'd come back like this, blastin)
(Like I said, it was funny like that in the ville sometimes)
(I had done too much to turn back)

Be full of ambition, never givin up on them good things
I love my life, it's worth livin
When I feel I'm at a standstill and things ain't right
I look to my niggaz for insight
and vice verse adjust my thoughts, play it like sports
Grown-ass man and I'm my own brand
It's safe to say I'm too fly to waste away
Responsibilities, give me a price to pay
Not livin for today cause half ain't okay
I'm far from greedy, but I want the whole entree
Give me silk, take away the satin
Prefer somethin beyond gold, I want platinum

And the Mayor, some be thugs and some players
Crown a new king G, bring me wine and grapes

separate the gold and the ice, playin it safe
It bring smiles to the gold teefs in my face

Hate to pack guns but if provoked I shoot it

Come in my zone, niggaz better 'bout face
Judgin from the fact I been in the game for some time
All I did was age like wine
Redefine what I'm after, did what I had to do
to break through, and reserve another chapter
For all those years, I played the rear
Now it's time to step up a notch and boost the rep up
I'm pure skill, like fishscale
Get you wide open this here's XL
I shall prevail in the game, feelin the flame grow stronger
Can't hold it back any longer
Right the wrong, whether storms ahead

No reason for treason, money don't matter to the clique
When it comes to us, we break it even

Full moon at night, on the stoop gettin right
I'll never forget the day before
Son told me to tuck my ice in cause niggaz was triflin
We did what he said but the habit in me
was to show it off, I still let my chain swang free
Not really thinkin 'bout a set up, or even gettin wet up
that summer night from such advice
So I proceed to parlay, like I do in BK
But this wasn't home, and niggaz shoulda known
to stay on point, niggaz shoulda been on point
And the price paid was lookin down the barrel of a joint
We was dead meat, and them niggaz was wolves
But they didn't want our flesh, dem niggaz wanted the jewels
It happened so quick, no time to get afraid
First instinct was to run like a slave
Me and Schoolly Boy was boxed in
My man Hugh's a few feet away, with a pound at his face
I looked, son in his eyes cause I know how he is
While the other faggot nigga had the gun in my ribs
I thought - fuck, shit 'bout to get buckwild
Popped off my chain, threw it with a Coke and a smile
Thinkin leave already, but them niggaz wasn't done
They went in our pockets for change, numbers and bubblegum
Now - how low can a lowlife get, askin what size are my kicks?
Like I'ma say 8 and shit
To myself I was sayin I'ma MURDER this kid
But thank the Lord they didn't peel back my wig
The jux wasn't longer than a minute to Mush
Then them niggaz tried to tell us, do the Carl Lewis
No backshots buddy, I began to walk backwards
And bust my ass, it all happened so fast
He thought I was shot, starin at me in shock

The real thinker: don't confuse me with Confucius
Cut on your blinker, get it right, I'm the prototype
I spit like I mix chemicals in beakers
Way before I heard my words thumping out a speaker
I knew I was too cool to play follow the leader
Everything I do goes over the head of overachievers
We can discuss this over lunch, it's over when I dump my thesis
Fuckin' punks, runch of bitches: y'all should wear pumps
Square up, run to Orange County for a ""fair"" one
I'm out your frequency, don't speak to me
Reason be I'm like a deity, I'm the elite
MURS: bow our heads, bon apetit
Let's turn Paid Dues into Coachella and have a feast!
This rap game is full of lames driving themselves insane
Looking for a lane, mayne

All I do is kick rhymes, have fun, and do cool shit

This is grown-man talk
Head up high with pride is how I walk. Take notes from the source
It's ? analog and the 2-inch ?
You had to show and prove the skill to cop you a deal
Co-signs was void, shortcuts didn't exist
You had to go hard in the paint to score
Testing time to separate the weak from those
Who had abilities to transcend beats in other words, yo
You had rappers, and then you had emcees

Sideways talk nowadays: larceny
Fast forward, present time, now it's something called 360 deal
Idiots ask where do I sign?
Bend over! Face down, gettin dick from behind
I'm shaking my head thinking you out your cotton-picking mind!

The fat raps, so pass that and let me hit it
Got me gassed, black; skins was mad fat
She flipped it, Bronx is equipped with niggas that'll rip shit

With this shit I'll bomb the nation from a distance

Your whole team a bunch of pooh-puts who made a few bucks
Date a few sluts then y'all start running your lips a little too much
My whole crew wild, thick as new now
We go to clubs, hit the bar, and trip two thou
Other emcees ain't got a chance at all

Life on Earth is just a death sentence
Fuck it, alpha omega, arm, lega, lega, arm
With cold steel if you pose a threat to my neighbor

Dive in, become part of a cliche; that art of an expert
Your honor from New York to Florida

And I knew I wanted her for me

Well she looked at us both
Then she called me to her side

She said son, take time to know her
It's not an overnight thing
Take time to know her
Please don't go rushin to do your thing

But I didn't listen to my mama
I went straight to the church
I just couldn't wait for that little girl of mine
When I got off from work
The preacher was there
So was my future bride
He looked at us both and he called me to his side

Take time to know her
Not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Don't go rushin to do your thing

But it looks like every thing's gonna turn out all right
But then I came home from work a little early one night
And there she was kissin on another man
Now I know what mama meant when she took me by the hand

She said, take time to know her
Not an overnight fling
Take time to know her

She's the answered prayer ev'ry lonely man dreams of.
She's a temptress, she's a lady, she's the mother of my baby.

Sometimes I lie awake and watch her sleeping;
and I just wanna bust and the teardrops fill my eyes.
And I wonder what she'd think if she woke up and caught me weeping; 
'cause daddies and heroes ain't supposed to cry.
The morning always seems to catch us laughing
with the baby in the bed between us, safe and warm.
And I thank the Lord above for all the good times that I'm having

and I can't keep the pace, and I need a place to hide,
I run home to my own little world and take her in my arms,
and hold her; and I soon forget there's another world outside.

Everyday searching for the one I was missing
Now that I have you, I won't let you go
You'll stay close to me cause I need you so
You will never be, far away from me
I would get crazy, and would miss you so

Baby Bash

Your body's like a rollercoaster
My favorite attraction, let me get closer
You're the drug I got addicted
This time I'm pledging guilty
I know I'll be convicted

I lose the sense of gravity
When you start moving on me
We're on the same orbit,
You know that I love it
I was poisened you're the remedy
When you're kissing over me

Baby what d'you do to me.",Roller Coaster Ride,2011

Yo, you don't wanna ride with Dirt, you still stuck in coach
You don't wanna fly in first, yo, I can spit
One verse and leave in a new Benzer
Take a trip down south and put some h**s to work, you hear me

Dirt McGirt, you n****z gon' respect it
I'm drunk and crunk so don't come in my direction
I'm ready to thump and get the whole crew arrested
Bail 'em out and laugh about it in Texas, yo

And get with Rome, down in Caki-Lac
And hit the spot, in the hood where the happenings at
Where the shootin' and the fightings, and the stabbings at
Where the Lincolns and the Chevys, and the Cadi's at, s***

Them down south n****z been loved Dirt
Take a shot to the head, if you been through the worse
Show respect to your n****z, who been doin' it first

I'm the truth, I don't need to go to church in a suit
Each verse is the proof, I drink a 100 Proof

When Wu is coming through, the outcome, critical
F***ing with this style, the outcome get physical
Meth get lyrical, and y'all can get my g*******
Don't forget them aid essentials, vitamins and minerals

Heh, ya'meen, I'm taking one for the team

Dirt Dog, I'm feeling this but I'd rather feel rich
I mean filthy rich, I'm corporate now

Weed and drank drank and weed, and a bad yellow bitch on top of me

I got my name on a candy blimp, I got a drop top six on chrome rims

I got cash like Baby and Slim, but I'm a juvenile with a lot of gems
And I'm still a baby gangsta, with a AK and a nine double M
I'm Lil' Flip and I'm living lavish, I got a lot of homeboys that live in Dallas
I got partnas in Kansas City, I got partnas that gangbang down in Cali

I got hoes that be tossing salad, I got hoes that steal out shopping malls
I got a hoe to give me head, my niggaz call her Lock Jaw
You know what, I sold a hundred thousand independent
That mean before I got a deal, I been had a million

Them 20 inches sittin low 
We Ball 24's 7's all that we know 
Screens and neon lights gon show 
When my trunk unlock pop and show 
Ya already know 
Paint drippin off the door 
Not Engaged with no lady, fall in love with em no! 
You may think I'm crazy never knew this type of love before 
I'm love with my foreign, yes I'm married to my dough.... 
I'm in love with my money... mmmm

You can catch me squeezing grain 
Sittin crooked on D's and swangz 
Color changin lizard he's insane 
Ya womans missing then he's to blame 
Charge it to the game keep the change 
Most marriages blyossom and die... 
When its over I'm tellin her bye 
But she acts like I'm tellin a lie 
While you fallin in love with a she... 
I rather be dubblin a G 
Could you see me in a car that rhymes with rent me and starts with a be 
Could you see a Bentley 
Parked in the crunkest spot in ya hood 
Candy coat on top of the hood 
And my fist on top of the wood 
Sparkling good 
Say you ain't after my change I don't believe ya 
If a skeezer ask me to feed her 
With my visa then I'm gon leave her 
Koopa don't want ya koopa don't need ya 
{ But I Love You } that's sweet 
I rather be ridin on glass feet 
With leather up under my ass cheeks 
Its not like I changed over night 
Been actin like this since last week 
Better Ask P my money stretched like an athelete at a track meet 
Seen him last week in a Jag Jeep 
{ But they don't even make them yet 'causezin } 
Ok I'm lyin I don't know what it was 
But I swear that boi was sittin on buttons 
I know you want a relationship with a balla but no thanx Look 
I'd rather be shining my twanks 
You must think this is a bank but it ain't 
Money increase and never would shink 
Hoes that be dikin even be fightin.... 
When I pull up on 20 inch titans 
'cause I got what them girls be likin 
Them uhh... 

[Chorus] 

[Paul Wall] 
Hold on hold up a second man 
I never mack to a metro dame 
You better respect the game 
See my gecko chain and correct ya brain 
I love my car like it was my girlfriend I like to carress the grain 
Followed the wheel and I got aroused 
Swung in the ditch and I wrecked the frame 
Broke up with my foreign car and fell in love with my cadillac 
The Ringling Brothers enquired to how my trunk turns flips like an acrobat 
I act a rat, 'cause I'm from the gutter 
Ya girl stutter when I pull up next to ya 
You been with the girl 6 months Paul Wall 
Is the reason she won't give sex to ya 
Why all that plex in ya 
'cause a german company made my rims 
My big body's pregant with twins I'm bout to induce a baby benz 
Ya car was fly in the hood but my candy paint just wet ya flames 
I'm sittin on 22 inch baby sitters babelous threatin ya name 
Forgot to change the diaper so when I crept in the lane I left a stain 
Everytime it rains, paint drips It makes a mess and I get the blame 
My TV's are the pet I train I can make em roll over and play dead 
My car was blue on the freeway 
But when I stopped at the light it changed to red 
You betta re arrange ya head thinkin I trick my cash to a broad... 
Go ahead and ask ya broad I got more green than the grass in a yard 
And that's so raw It ain't hard for me to get the class to applaud 
I shine like a blasting star, glass on a car more blacker than tar

With scuffed up dirty J's, and plenty holes in your shirt
And won't nobody help you, they treat you like dirt
It's my life, I married the streets and made the hood my home
And I'ma represent this shit, till I'm gone
And even when I'm gone, you can listen to my songs
Cause I'ma let you know, what's right and what's wrong
It's wrong to borrow money, and never give it back
But if your family poor, it ain't wrong to sell crack
It's right to make cash, and make sure your click eat
And it's right to do a feature, with a nigga like me
Cause I'ma tell the truth, about everything I say
I've been through some shit, nigga I came a long way
From boy to man, from zero to grands
From no shows to mo' shows, and now I'm a man

[Hook]
[Laboo]
See I be trying to spit some knowledge, to these kids
But should I tell 'em go to college, or quit and find a gig
Cause the world don't really give you jack, and if you black
Fucking round with that crack, get you some time on your back
That's why I always, try to keep it clean
The FED time got my brother, doing fifteen
At bed time, send my prayers up
And I stay prepared for the money in the air, I'm trying to have stuff
That's why, I'm all off in the rap game
And worldwide, trying to spread it 'cross the map mayn
But black pride, got me thinking there's no limitation
Gotta survive regardless, any situation well

[Lil' Flip]
I'm grinding (where you at), on the block
(what's that) hand full of rocks, looking for the cops
(HPD) pull up, I wouldn't want to be em
(what you do) hop the first gate, see em
Thank God I'm still breathing, cause I'm a little heathen
I'm the type of cat, that start shit for no reason
Use to have meetings, with the church deacon
Cause I was doing other shit, while he was preaching
And every single thing, he was saying came true
And when we got our shit together, in 9-2
And boy I was a fool, at making that cash
Hit licks flipping bricks, right after every class

[Hook]
(*talking*)
That's right my life, my life of shining
Laboo, Lil' Flip all about grinding, living that life
You know that life that high life, the life of ice
And fancy clothes, and all that shit
I'm talking bout living it up nigga, down here in Texas
Niggaz ain't tripping you hear me, shit get hectic sometimes nigga
I feel you my nigga, be careful what you dream for nigga",My Life,2003
O.G. Ron C.,"[Chorus] 
Oh no, there go them Texas boys banging in a fo' do' 
Top fell out the drop, crawling on 84's 
Think of taking my slab, baby I don't think so 
My heat under my seat, and I don't love you hoes 
Living it like a G, but still I gotta lay low 
Five percent or ten, but still my screens goin' glow 
These haters be in my mix, and these boppers be on my dick 
Every time I come round the corner 

I'm from the land of opportunity, in God we trust 
But haters in my mix, got me paranoid and disgust 
I'm scoping out my side mirrors, when my car's in park 
It's after dark, and my slab is fresh meat to these sharks 
Boys thinking I been drinking, so I'm off my note 
But I got seventeen surprises, tucked inside of my coat 
See me strut through the parking lot, on 22's plus 
It's a must I make all haters, eat my dust 
Them jump-out boys, waiting trying to catch me slipping 
I ain't tripping, grain ain't the only thing that I'm gripping 
Boys jacking with these tow trucks, thinking they slick 
But take a trip to South Lee, and end up in a ditch 
They got my purple people eater once, the next day 
I bought a Range Rover cash, and a new set of fronts 
I've been on feet for months, I'm taking haters to lunch 
Paul Wall and Trae, hit em with that one-two punch 

[Chorus] 

When I flip in my slab 
I'm fin to beat they back off, like I was legs 
Sitting low and tinted on chrome, gangstafied till I'm finished 
I'm bout to diminish these haters, when my trunk start waving 
Blue over gray, side of my drop with six T.V.'s I'm displaying 
They hate that I'm shining, with the fifth wheel falling flying down the block 
But if one of these haters, wanna jack me 
Slugs goin' be flying, out the glock 
I click for no reason, this season my slab is staining they brain 
And I be known for getting reckless in Texas, gripping on grain 
Forever be pimping, 84 tipping all through the South 
Grilling boppers all through my tint, with diamonds all in my mouth 
They all in my mouth, looking stupid when I burn right past em 
Cause some of these broads be living shife, and setting up for the jacking 
But not today, cause Trae goin' be flipping on top of his game 
We guerillas I'm mobbing with, ain't no stopping me man 
When I'm in my fo' do' solo, the slab is bound to get tossed 
And if you trying to be competition, then you bound to be getting lost 

[Chorus] 
 
Make way for the team, when the fo' do' be coming round the corner 
These haters are goners, cause I'ma drop the top when I wanna 
I know these jackers, better think before they reach out and touch 
Cause in back of the car is the Excursion, full of thugs that'll punch 
I know they wanted to get me, but they don't know what I'm bringing 
I pop the trunk and swing the block, while jamming Slow Loud And Bangin' 
Trae and Paul Wall on a mission, and ain't no stopping it man 
With my hand on my heat in my seat, and the other on grain 

Mo' money mo' problems man, the legend is true 
You better stay up on your toes, when you ride 22's 
I'm rolling strapped, everywhere I go I'm watching my back 
Cause on my block, them jackers don't give a damn if I rap 
People see me being friendly, and they think that I'm soft 
But the truth is, my best friend is a sawed off 
These haters in my mix, got me losing composure 
But if they take one step closer, it ain't gon be kosher naw

A icon on the mic for showcasing my verbal skills
I'm in the club posted up with some gang bangers
Still flipping the old school candy Cadillac on swangers
I got a Styrofoam white cup full of that drank
Looking for that dank, my hustle game sharp as a shank
Big bank take little bank, 84's and candy paint
Trying to find some ""Honey Love"" my macking game is top rank
These ho's peeping me, ill hustling on the side
Eavesdropping my conversation, trying to figure which car I drive
I'm on the scene strapped up like I was bungee jumping

Need a hoe break a hoe never nuthin' new to us
Turnin' hoes to house wives never been cool with us
Soon enough all these dealers are gonna catch up
Till then fuck it I'm winnin' so I'm a stack up
Flows like a river the current is so rapid
Hit with the ratchet thats how shit happens
Next time you're yappin' make sure it be about that big money talk
Let that lil' money walk call me what you want but don't call me for front
Southside I got what you want come holla at me

O.G. Ron C.,"Every since the day you went away and left me lonely and cold 
My life just hasn't been the same, oh baby no 
When I looked into your eyes the moment that I let you go I just broke down 
Baby if I ever get the chance to be with you again I would sacrifice 
'Cause the feeling that I feel within 
No another man would never make me feel so right 
Its nice to smile when I get your phone call at night, 
But I rather have you here with me, 
Right next to me and that's the way you hold me tight, 

I got to let you know I feel so weak without your touch 
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much 
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny 
For you id cross the world for you id do anything 
That's right baby I'm going crazy 
I need to be your lady 
I've been thinking latley 
That you and me, yes we can make it 
Just ride with me, roll with me I'm in love with you baby 
That's right baby I'm going crazy 
I need to be your lady 
I've been thinking latley 
That you and me, yes we can make it 
Just ride with me, roll with me I'm in love with you baby 

Brake it down now tell you what I feel, 
From the moment I met you its been so damn real, 
My heart seems to skip another beat every time we speak, 
Can't believe I feel so weak 
Tell me that you really need me, 
You want me, you miss me, you love me, 
I'm your lady, 
Ill be around waiting for you, 
Put it down be the women for you 
I'm falling so deep for you 
Cause your you 
I'm callin, callin out to you, 
What am I gonna do 
Its true no frontin 
Its you, and no other, 
I can know long ago I'm with out you ill just break down 

I got to let you know I feel so weak without your touch 
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much 
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny 
For you id cross the world for you id do anything 
That's right baby I'm going crazy 
I need to be your lady

It's gettin' hard to dodge the women
But I'm still pitching hard white balls
Faster than Roger Clemens,
Ya know the kid with the O's
That's as large as linens
When it comes to sellin' trees
I'm as large as Timberland
My lawyer got my charges slimmin'
He said the only way I am goin upstate
If it's in larger swimmin'
Pull out the garage like gremlins
Anarge with trimmins
System in it that have the projects tremblin'
Ya know nothin' about lettin' a few strays go off
Ya only reach for your hip when your two ways go off
Shots'll fly by your head
Your toup blow off
I ain't crip I'm just a blue gray show off
Ghetto fab I more than rap for my bucks
Keep two 9's on me like Warren Sapp from the Buccs
The word I'm ballin' be flowin' to the fed Jakes
And I keep chicks on my lap throwin' me head fakes
Nigga I walk around with the grams you stackin'
And me and Flex don't roll unless they Andrew Jackson

O.N.E.,"I walk the lonely streets, 
I watch the people passing by. 
I used to smile and say hello. 
Guess I was just a happy guy. 
Then you happened, girl, 
This feeling that possesses me. 
I just can't move myself. 
I guess it all just had to be. 

[Chorus:]
I can't see nobody, no, I can't see nobody. 
Mine eyes can only look at you, you. 

I used to have a brain, I used to think of many things. 
I watched the falling rain and listened to the sweet birds sing. 
Don't ask me why, little girl. 
I love you and that's all I can say. 
You're ev'ry ,ev'ry breath I take.
You are my nights; my night and day. 

[Chorus]

Every single word you hear
Is coming from this heart of mine. 
I never felt like this before
A love like yours so young and fine. 
And now as I try to forget you
It doesn't work out any way. 
I loved you such a long time ago
But in my eyes you'll always be. 

Every single word you hear
Is coming from this heart of mine. 
I loved you such a long time ago
Don't know why,
And I don't know why, baby

O.N.E.,"So what you sayin' is my ego's to big to admit that I messed up?
Man why you always trippin'?
Fuck it. I messed up. Im sorry. Not simpin'.
Nah scratch that I meant it. I
'm tired of this lyin', this cheatin', cryin'.
The difference. What you trynna make? And I cant be mad at that.
I was blind to the fact that you always had my back.
And I noticed that after I saw you cryin'.
The old me is dead now have a moment of silence.

We fuss, we fight, we cry
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more.
We fight, we cry
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
Girl I ain't trynna hurt you no more.

It kinda sorta somewhat seem like every single night.
Your an inch closer to leavin' after every single fight.
I keep screamin' what im thinkin' with out ever thinkin' twice.
'Bout the reason why I argue when I barely think im right.
She always mentionin' how she so sick of my inconsiderence.
Like christmas when I ditched her then I kicked it with a different chick.
I pictured if this situation switched I'd loose it.
Apologizes is to repetitive I'ma just prove it.

We fuss, we fight, we cry
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more.
We fight, we cry
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
Girl I ain't trynna hurt you no more.

I ain't trynna hurt ya.
I just wanna love you girl.
You get bad sometimes but you still my baby.
Why you wanna walk out the door and give up everything that we've been fightin' for.
Whoa! See I promise this time I'ma change girl.
No more lies, no more cheatin', no more games girl.
I'm just trynna be the one for you
And I'm doin' it all for you.
Give me one more chance.
Let me be the man.
I could be the one you need.
I don't know what I would do with out you girl I'm incomplete.

We fuss, we fight, we cry
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more.
We fight, we cry
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more

There's a baby in the family, I know he's not mine
He's not mine, there's no way he could be

He looks and acts like me, he's even got my name
Oh, how I love him 'cause he's my son just the same
He's a proud little fellow, he's a cute little lad
Oh, I know the reason he looks and acts like me

Dream it while you can
Maybe someday I'll make you understand

De tanto te querer
Iê
De tanto amar você
Iê

Eu não desisto do que eu quero
Mas não me desespero
Te espero
Na tarde quente ou madrugada fria
Na tristeza ou na alegria

Ficar sozinho não rola
Mas amor não se implora
Nem se joga fora
O amor a gente conquista
E não há quem desista
Se o coração chora

Chora com vontade de te ver
Chora com saudade de você
Chora às vezes eu nem sei por que
Deve ser de tanto te querer
Iê

De tanto amar você
Bate na palma da mão, vem iê
De tanto te querer
Iê
Deve tanto amar você
Iê",De Tanto Te Querer,2018
