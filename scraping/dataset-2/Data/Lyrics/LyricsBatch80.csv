Coolio,"[Montell] 
I called you on the phone 
To see if you was at home alone 
Somethin' just ain't right 
Tell me, where were you last night? 
You were supposed to be with me 
And I paged your ass around 10:33 
You didn't even call me back 
Now tell me, baby, what up wit that? 

Now you told me you need 
A man like me from the streets 
Remember when I was tossin' 
That ass on 4th and Slawson
You said I was everything you want 
And now all the condoms that I bought 
I gotta box 'em up for the next one 
'cause you just want to flex and have your fun, baby 

[Coolio] 
You want to play those games
Thought you was dealin' wit a flea 
But you're dealin' wit a G 
You better recognize the see, double O, L 
I'm down wit Montell (how you livin' homie?) 
I'm livin' kinda swell 
I thought you was the one, yeah 
I thought you was my baby 
Now I see through your games 
And I know you're tryin' to play me 
So you can put your pumps on and get your rump on 
'cause your hump ain't that strong
Well, you can have my Land Rove 
Give me 30 minutes and a fifth of yak 
And I'll rip that, smack that, hit that ass 
Like King-T do's it 
I got to go rippin' it 
Put you to the side, so I can catch up on my pimpin' 
Ya better make a left wit the bullshit you stickin' me with
Brothas be hittin' up they hood on your kitten 
My partner don't play that 
Yeah, I had to say that 
What go around, come back around 
This is the payback 

[Montell] 
And it feels just like payback 
Ay yo, who's pimpin' who? 
And shit like that 
All those games you're tryin' to play 
You'll miss out on a good thing baby 
(It feels like) Payback 
Who's playin' who, girl? 
'cause that was kinda wack 
All those gizames, you're tryin' to plizay 
Yeah 

Girl, it feels like payback 
I really really hate to say that 
I thought you was triflin', givin' me the shove 
But you're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my love 
(Oh, I thought she was mad as hell, 'cause I was for one thing) 
Way back I was cheatin' 
You want to get even, but I ain't goin' out like that 
If I apologize for all the lies 
Oh, believe me girl, I'm sorry 
There's a right and a wrong way to love somebody 
And I know the right way 
Can we start tonight babe? 
You need to lose that loser in a hurry 
And you're never gonna have to worry 
No, no, hell no

Feels like payback 
Who's pimpin' who? 
And shit like that 
All those games you're tryin' to play 
You'll miss out on a good thing, baby 
It feels like payback 
Mistakes that I made (way back) baby 
All those gizames you're tryin' to plizay 
You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my love 

Feels like payback 
Who's pimpin' who? 
And shit like that 
All those games you're tryin' to play 
(All those games that you were tryin' to play) 
(Said it feels just like) Feels like payback 
Who's playin' who, girl? 
'cause that was kinda wack 
All those gizames your tryin' to plizay 
Oh, girl 

We'll miss that loving that we shared for oh so long 
Let's put this all behind us 
And love will always find us 
You see, all of your men and my girlfriends 
They'll all be in the past 
We'll be solid as a rock 
And we'll make it 
We'll make it 
Yeah, yeah, hey hey
Gonna miss out on a good... 

It feels just like it 
(Feels like) Payback 
(And I ain't even like that baby)

Coolio,"When I was fifteen years old
Straight dog game I was told
I went from selling pennies in a writers dike
Time and ass through the psychic breaker
Situation critical phone home
Phone home

Call phone
Ya seen a boatload of situations
Fedanglelations invalid ghetto pass late ass registrations
Boy I tell you she was pitiful 
Damn
Hopefully repentable
Get it right

I try to stay away from artificial plastic ass
Blow the motherfucking individual

Exercise your game man
Just use your brain man don't run the same game
Exercise your game man
Fertilize your grass player get that cash
Exercise your game man
But you gotta make it last
One low loco gone ride away
Into the sunset but I ain't done yet
Respect yourself and wear your best
Keep your guard up 'cause we'll be hard up
When your hittin' dips better check your clip
And watch the police and the Bloods and the Crips
Anyway you do it gotta pay your dues
Keep one in the chamber 'cause the shoes always loose
Rubber wheels beat rubber heels any day
Put the green in your jeans and get the hoes out your halo
Or you can stay broke while your homies is rollin' smokes
And sippin' yak and smokin' denk and tellin' jokes
Babap babap
Fool you get laughed at
I worked to hard for mine to let you take a dime
No pain no gain no pocket change
Prepare yourself for battle

I'm rated X like Malcolm E-40 Coolio and Kam sprinkle game like talcum
You won't to make money in this game well let me show you
How to do for self 'cause ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Oh you frontin' like lint if you waitin' on the mystery god
'Cause ain't nobody gonna give you shit
You ghost to get up off your ass and put yourself in heaven on Earth
Before you pass and exercise your game
Exercise your game fool
Peep game from a young ass
Rollin' on the one way
Foot to the gas got that indo mixed with hash

Monday through Sunday and all in-between
I fend for my papers my self and my dream
Ain't no busters or no suckers on my team or wear my patches
Call the pimp
You can call me the rat
Watch my feet hit the track ain't no lookin' back
I'm on a mission trying to put my fucking click on a mac
But these niggas don't know the half
Runnin' with riff raff but I got some game for your bitch ass
'Cause your game is weaker than an anorexic
I exercise my game until I had my game perfected
I wrote the game on paper then I put the game on record
You better check it nigga don't you every disrespect it

Coolio,"As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
‘Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like

We keep spending most our lives

We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now but will I live to see 24?
The way things is going I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't lookin'
It's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!

Coolio,"Verse One:

Seven in the morning, standing in the line
three fools in front of me, drinking on some wine
two in the back of me sucking on a joint
and one in back of them ready for a new sport
there's 4-5 suckers way way in the back
stooped down low with the crowd smokin' crack
they looking at me funny coz I got a record out
and a nigga with a record out is supposed to have some proud
a forth of the people in the line be hookers
but the other forth betta ask help themself
a forth of the people having good faith
and all of the rest all fucked up in the head
a bald headed stank bitch is about to make me laugh
and a nigga who need a bath is asking for my autograph
ain't nothing changed but the time
I got to get mine, so I'm standing in the county line

Chorus:

This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
coz it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
you got to have the conned, and let'n them looking funny

Verse Two:

I walked through the front door to fill out my ap
Here comes another sap asking if I rap 
I don't say a word coz he know that I do
I'm down with the MAAD ass you know Hoo!
I take a numer and a seat
I'm sweating from the heat
Somebody got their shoes off
I smell their feet
My number is 80, it's still on 20
I look up at the clock and now IS 10:30
Free butter and cheese oh please, oh please
Can I get my food stamps so I can leave
I got money and a car but they don't really know it
now they asking me a gang of questions coz I told them I was homeless
I'm living in a car drive back in the alley
but I use to shack up with a hooker named Sally
line after line
ruff is the time 
My life is in a bomb so I'm standing in the county line

Chorus

Verse Three:

I'm sittin' at a desk talking to a social worker
She thinks I'm a fool but I know that I can work her

-Punk ass ho' sittin' behind the window all toe up ass tramp 
rollin' that week sheets of mine

""You have a penetentry record""
-I said I know that BIATCH!

She wants to know what kind a work do I do
I said I haven't worked since 1982
I can't find a job though I looked and I looked         
took one hit of the crack and mistook
she sittin there wonderin' what did coz I did
and the whole time I'ma watchin like I'm smokin me a joint
job search work the projects whackness
and in a few weeks I'd get my check
now I got to wait for them to call me trough the window
so I can get some cash to pay for the hotel and the bathshow
it's 5:13 by the clock on the wall
mothafuckez move so I can make a phonecall
shit is getting late and the time is 29
that why so many niggas standing in the county line

Fools be trippin' when it's time to get their freak on
Runnin' round town, puttin' it down with-out
No protection, for they erection
When it's time for selection what's your direction?
Before you make a choice, you betta do some inspection
If you don't know my aim and don't know my game, then
Let me explain now
Iesha slept wit Mark and Mark slept wit Tina
And Tina slept wit Javier the first time he seen her
Javier slept wit Lupe and Lupe slept with Rob
'Cause he was rollin' on beads and had a good ass job
Rob slept wit Lisa who slept wit Steve and
Steve was positive, H.I.V
What started off as a plan ended up in the plot
Ya betta cool ya ass off cause it's too damn hot

Oh-ohh it's too hot, too hot, too hot lady too hot
Gotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade
It's too hot, too hot, too hot homie too hot
Gotta make some sense, from this mess that we made

You're doin' everything momma told ya not to do
Now you're tryin' to walk away cause ya know it's true
Your sister can't explain, and your brother's ashamed
To admit you both have the same last name
I don't have to ask you where you've been
Cause the matches in your purse say Holiday Inn
""A mind is a terrible thing to waste"" that was the slogan
But now it's ninety-five and it's ""Don't forget the Trojan""
Explained it to her momma, before somebody get her
Gotta hip her to the game of those smooth talkin' niggas
Love is the word, seldom meant but often heard
Latex safe sex you better learn
Or get hip to the facts before you react or
End up in a box on your back
Sometimes you ask for what you want and, get what you got
Don't get caught up in the plot, it's too damn hot

Another day in the city and, oh what a pity
Even though we did our duty things are still lookin' shitty
Everybody in the pack stacked, tryin' to make some scratch
Walkin' in the rain but they ain't got no hat
Understand how we livin' in the nineties loc
Nuclear waste, cannibalism, and pistol smoke
Sex lies videotape and rape
Just a little bump n grind can seal your fate
We need to do something drastic, shit is gettin' tragic
And if you don't believe me, then go ask Magic
Everybody an they momma preachin' abstinence, these
Kids ain't checkin' for absti-shit
So put a condom in they hand and hope it don't bust

Coolio,"(So much drama in the)

No disrespect to the opposite sex 
But I ain't flexed punani yet that's worth my royalty checks 
Men be trying to get laid  women be trying to get paid 
So  somebody gotta get played (right)
Now you claim I'm runnin' game and still let us run the train 
Pulling Coolio's braids  it wasn't me  it was the fame 
Let a dame complain about disrespecting my African queen 
Ass hangin' out them Daisy Dukes jeans, jockin'
Damn I love civilization 
Wants to know my occupation home location and means of transportation 
The correct combination unlocked your placenta 
I got a cellular phone with a rubber antenna 
On a three story house, drive a four door Ac 
Favorite song of all time Mobb Deep's ""Hit It From the Back"" 
Then jet, I turn a bitch into my favorite 
She know my name cause I got more game than Sega CD 

[Chorus]
You know it's drama, but it sound real good (3X) 
You knew the game, and you still ended up on your back 
You know it's drama, but it sound real good (3X) 
You knew the game, and you still ended up on your back 

I try U.N.I.T.Y. but why? 
Cause when I was lackin', bitches made me want to roll over and die 
So now I lie, cause bitches are like flies {why?} 
They attract to the best shit {oh!} 
You gotta play Max Julian's role unless you plan on being celibate 
Cause bitches want the money clip and whatever dick that comes with it 
{The bitch} saw me in the Lex and didn't know it came from Avis 
Now she's on the Tip like my name was John Davis 
And I'm knowin' what she thinks {what?} 
I'm a sweep her off her feet because I bought the hoe a drink 
Bitch, ha ha yeah I'm living nice, got a two o'clock flight to Atlanta 
{Tomorrow} so maybe we can kick it {tonight} 
Right there I knew my dick was getting wetted 
Cause I played into this bitch's Cinderella complex 
Whatever you want to hear, I can say 
Forget the bitch the next day, instant replay 

[Chorus]

Yo Ras, let me talk about these bitches for a minute 
But let's get it straight, when I say the word bitch 
I don't mean all women 
Cause hookers come a dime a dozen if you thought they wasn't 
You can hit this hoe today, and tomorrow you can hit her cousin 
Or her mama, you gots to have drama 
Nigga flash some currency and go up in her auntie! 
I'm talkin' bout the skinless type loc 
You know the type that seem to like the taste of swipe 
Check it 
When it comes to Saving Hoes Coolio ain't in it 
Don't call me Captain, general, sergeant, or lieutenant 
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh 
I gave the bitch my autograph, and she gave me some ass 
But as soon as the hoe tried to get in my pocket 
I shot her ass away from me schch like a skyrocket 
Take it from a G, period, no comma, to keep these hookers 
On they toes, you know the rest

Coolio,"Intro:
""Soul"" (echo)

Hook:
""Soul on ice"" 

Verse 1:
I was told two wrongs don't make a right
But three rights make a left
Act your age not your color 
But I'd rather act darker
Mark a page with mazes of labyrinth
Fuck up a rhyme so bad
I leave the microphone abstinent
To MC or not to MC?
Beyond B.E.T. and MTV exists me
Origin
Cause God created man and man created hip hop
I declined to participate until I was orientated
I heard 50,000 drivebys
And 49,999 was lies
No surprise, as the sun rises
Thine eyes have seen the light
But we stalk the night
I expose like an overbite
In limbo I lamp
Rape the lady kill the tramp
The wrong action for the motive
So now
Give me 50,000 black angry role models
Take me to DC I'll throw the first fuckin' bottle
Cause I don't give a fuck about a menial existence
And I don't give a fuck about nonviolent resistance
Civil right will not suffice
In the name of Jesus Christ they got my Soul On Ice

Hook

Verse 2:
Walkin' on skulls cause I'm two steps ahead
So I started at square three 
Now I'm Cubed like O'Shea Jackson be
Subzero catching fatalities to my spirituality
Smoke like a chimney, drink like a Kennedy
Still no remedy 
Fuck shooting a fair one
Cause open cuts from fuckin' some nigga up 
Can lead to contracting HIV positivity
You never know who got traits of femininity
What agwan, pussy wool blood clot 
And deal with the bullshit bodybot business faggot
You play the villain
There will be another soundbwoy killin'
Benadryl pumps through my adrenaline
Feelin' my raps weight 
I track Heavy like Tony Dofat
Hip hop is 2% milk but mostly no fat (phat)
And most MCs ain't prepared 
So what I say goes over your head like pubic hair
In 1999 (flip the script)
Triple six
One world government ""Novus Ordo Seclorum""
Check your dead president
Represented on the one dollar bill 
And if Clinton was the answer it was a stupid question

Hook",Soul on Ice,1996
Coolio,"Greetings, earthlings
We have now taken over your radio

Goin' straight through the hole
You ain't got no game
I'm breakin' ya out the frame
Coming through like a train
Looking to take over the world is my goal
With my unstoppable crew takin' all control
You can't get none of this, we're runnin' this
Well taker, earth shaker, 3 point gunnin' this
Get out the lane, I'm comin' through
And if you don't want to move then I'm comin' right through you

It's like inch by inch and step by step
I'm closing in on your position and destruction is my mission
Though eight is not enough, your whole squad better duck
It's like switch when I bust
Now you're whole crew is dust
Comin' through my area, I'ma have to bury ya
The real scream team on your scream scene
It's like showdown on the range
Go tell me who want to tangle with the
Ghetto witch-doctor neighborhood superhero

We want it all (want it all)
Unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore)
In the game we take you to war (war)
You ain't seen nothin' like this before
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low

Insane like a runaway train I'm in your lane
Like it's only 3 seconds to score to win the game
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
Untamed, you won't like it when I change
And you are type strange
Make room, manaical monster in the game
And I got my eye on you
Deadshot aim, as free throws keep comin' down like rain
You feelin' me, I'm feelin' you
The monstar again, I'm tellin' you
Pass me the rock, now I'm headed to the basket
Get up out my way is what you better do
My tactics is unsportsmanlike conduct
You better ask it
Don't get no better than this, you catch my drift
You get stripped by ballhandlers ruled by swackhammer
Danger, you're dealin' with official hoop-bangers
With hang time like a coat hanger
Jump, with thunderous 360-degree type dunks
What up doc the monstar funk

Lightning strikes and the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Above the rim, finessin' and moves is animated
Once I get to ballin', I can't be deflated
I'm rugged raw, my monstars is gettin' money
When clicks get to buggin', I'm snatchin' up their bunnies (uhh)
Every step I take shakes the ground
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shakes you down
This is my planet, I'm bout business
The best that ever done it, can I get a witness (uhhh)
Cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
You in it for the money
Or in it for the love, M.J.
Twenty- three ways to make a pay
Loungin' in the mothership back around my way (uhh)
I'm twenty-eight light years old
If the refs get political, dribble like bob dole
Am I gettin' lyrical
Daddy, I think so
Monstar droppin' flavor fluid so drink slow

We want it all (want it all)
Unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore)
In the game we take you to war (war)
You ain't seen nothin' like this before

And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low

Yo, god bless
Pick up your chest
Here's an example of how I can stress your full court press
With finesse, I bench-press your stress whenever you test
We're speed ballin', on the fastbreak just like the pony express
I'm gonna mingle in your face and take the lid off
Just use your head and forfeit the game
You and your team just need to back off
Get off my block, gimmie the ball, I said it's my rock
I'm startin' a line-up by gettin' why'all to bring the livestock
Throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot
When we come right through tell me what you really gonna do
We'll leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
While you abandon your ship, we take your championship
With nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip
Money spending, goal tending, stay-bending teams like crash cars
Who do they be
They be the monsters

What are you talking about
Unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore)
In the game we take you to war (war)

Coolio,"It's time to take you to its full potential
Peep this
And drop some game on the instrumental and
It's a symptom that you listen close and better tell your folks
Let the locust lock
First things first since your date of birth
You've been kinda' confused about what your life is worth
50 million times don't wait and go
You gotta' take control
Those fools don't want to be home
You can do anything that you want to do
All you got to do is to put your brain into it
Take your time and educate your mind
In the long run I'm sure you're fine
If you walk the walk you can talk the talk
But don't wait too long ''Cause' life is short
And remember, no matter what they tellin' you
If you try, you can be a winner too

Keep on pushing
Moving on up
Everybody we're moving on up
Moving on up
You're a winner
You gotta keep pushing
Moving on up
Everybody we're moving on up
Moving on up
You're a winner

Everybody rides with the women boys and girls
Each one teach one but we can't save the world
All in one day you could take it play by play
And once you're on the path
Don't you ever go this way
If your leader wants to holla' but you can't make him plead
You can give a man some wisdom but you can't make him man feel
'Cause
Stitchin time says nine
Dirty bird gets the worm
But all you can think about is gettin' attention for your firm
If knowledge is power and power is knowledge, then
How so many idiots be graduating from colleges
Better the b-side than the be gutted fool
Than to speakin' to move all out
You know what I'm talking about
When opportunity knocks you better let him in and sit him on down
And try to be his friend
In order to be a professional first you got to be a beginner
But if you keep on pushing you can be a winner

Keep on pushing
Moving on up
Everybody we're moving on up
Moving on up
You're a winner
You gotta keep pushing
Moving on up
Everybody we're moving on up
Moving on up
You're a winner

Red yellow black white or brown
If every mind their business we can all get down
It all starts and on
''Cause once they're grown they're gone
And once they're on their own their own
You got to leave them alone
Be a leader and if you can't be a leader
Make sure your leader is a damn good teacher and
Imagine if you was in a car and your life was wasted
Somebody was on your back and you had to give him some space
Put the better to the matter where it match at low
But make sure you stay in your lane
And go strop to strop
We don't need no penalty's or eliminations
Or disqualifications
What we need is penetrations
Now what you heard before but sometimes life is what you make it
I ain't the one that's known for fakin' or perpetratin'
If Albert was an Einstein
And Phillis was a Diller
And Michael Jackson was a thriller
Then you could be a winner

Keep on pushing
Moving on up
Everybody we're moving on up
Moving on up
You gotta keep moving
Everybody we're moving on up

And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy, 'cause, now you done lost the hustler
A down-ass brother done been replaced by a buster

Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us

So hold your head up high if your're poor and righteous

But at the times of despair we gotta pull ourselves together

You ain't never lyin'. I knew she wasn't right cause

I'ma scuffle and struggle until I'm breathless and weak
I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there waitin' with the sounds bumpin'

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

You need to loosen up and live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feelin'
For your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryna stack
And keep up with the Joneses, takin' advantage of your own
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut 'til it's right
When there's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if your're poor and righteous
I know times seem strife, and problems seem endless
But at the times of despair we gotta pull ourselves together
And if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it
'Cause nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle in 'drive' and stop by my side

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked, or the straight and narrow
We got one voice to give and one life to live
Stand up for something or lie down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make it big
I guess I'll see you when you see me

I'll (I'll) see (see) you (you) when you get there (when you get there)
If you ever get there
I'll (I'll) see (see) you (you) when you get there (when you get there)
If you ever get there

Coolio,"I'm gettin bunions from all the disrespectful sisters in my face 
I give love 
But when push come to shove 
I'm 'posed to solo 

Diggin me out the ditch 
(Hey  hey  Cool  give me some chips  fool) Ain't that a bitch 
Ain't no cash just fallin out the sky 
You hell of high 

But why why did she touch the tie? 
But I start on full wit a gangsta limp 
Morris couldn't see this pimp 
I'm backslappin gimps 

True, I'll be in the cut, but you notice me 
Try to throw with me 
Now you want to roll with me, fate 
I'll lead you left instead of right 

Tonight's the night 
So, let's get the situation tight 
I hear 'em tryin to playa hate me on the under 
My momma said, ""Never let a sucker take you asunder"" 

Don't be gettin outta line where it concerns mine 
It might be your time, but it's my rhyme 

[Chorus]
Can I get down one time to make the people say yeah 
And nobody won't care? 
Can I get down one time without 
All the criticism and media in my business? 
Can I get down one time and release my rhyme 
And speak my mind? 
Can I get down one time? 
Can I get down one time? 

I take my picture with a smile like Jack 
'Cause I'm back 
You picturin' all them chips in stack 
I got love, though, don't be no stank hoe 

I'm not fallin' for the gank, yo 
God I thank, though 
Enemies it's your decision 
The gift I been givin' 

Got you in the life I'm livin' 
Watch your sane, sane like Marley Mike 
Your game ain't right 
You be slippin every night 

I'm hoverin' up in the nest with the claws out 
'Cause he had his paws out 
When he paused out 
He's out, now it's in with the new 

In with the two 
You know how these thieves do 

[Chorus] 

I can't do what I want, or how I want to 
This shit is drama 
So what is it you want, huh? 
We tryin' to make it to the tizzy 

I'll be a hell of busy bee 
The gizzy 
Through the frizzy, is we 
Tryin to have somethin' 

We goin off frontin' 
'Cause nothin' leaves nothin'
And nothin' means we head bumpin' 
Pumpin', no punk can hit this, my stable 

Twistin' me a fable 
Somethin' sweet like sable 
You shoulda reached out and grabbed it and got his pay nice 
Jealousy got him dropped, with his neck sliced 

Liquor be revelain' 
The homies true feelings 
So, I be willin' 
To turn into a villain 

Then if you're still with me 
You got to chill with me 
Bustin' lyrics with a skill when they deal with me 
Never senseless 

Thank you for your business 
And I got more rhymes 
Than L.A. Times got headlines

Coolio,"Uh!  Yeah!  What up?

I know y'all want to take me down
I know y'all want to see me get clowned
I know y'all want to take my sound
And put a nigga like me in the lost and found
But I refuse to fade
I'll stay this way
Spreadin' venom in the mic till I'm old and gray
And now niggaz want to attack me
Flip-flop and back me
But fool you's a mackey
I'll starch your ass like some khakis
Your shit is tacky and you better play the backwoods
Me and my crew will use your CD for a hackey sack
Imagine that
And it shouldn't be hard
Cause your style ain't large 
And you want to make all the profits with crowbars
Can you Dig It?
When nothin' can save it
Shock your ass like a phaser
Burn and cut like a laser
Amaze you, with this flava
I run with a pack of tennis shoe playa's

Can you dig it? 
Can you dig it?
Can you dig it?
Can you dig it? 
Can you dig it?
Can you dig it?

The first law of age is called survival
That's why I'm deadly on revival
And it's vital
To my basic instinct 
That all whack emcees become extinct
Because we on the brink
Or, should I say the edge
Like a schizophrenic with seventeen personalities walkin' on a ledge
Then you can't see the black cause it's blocked by the blue and the red
U-F-O's
And scandalous ass hoes
Waist deep in the shit, it's still smellin' like a rose
And I suppose
You want me to play superstar
And when I see you on the street act like I don't know who you are
So, you can run back and tell that
But I won't do that
So, fool you can chew that
To all sucka emcees you better beware
I been conjurin' up forces way back in my lair
And my crew don't scare
And we don't care
We act, we wear, I swear

[Chorus]

It's the thrilla
Straight outta Compton, not Manilla
Got a choke hold on the mic like I was M.C. Gorilla
Take this to the heart for real a
Don't you ever try to steal a 
Like AIDS this shit came like gin a
Might fuck up your liva
Call me Pharaoh cause I'm floatin' bustas up the river
When I deliver
Make your sister and your grandma shiver
Top feelin' steadily rakin' up the scrilla
Kickin' back in my easy chair sippin' on some Henna
Exol 'cause my whole crew is locin'
And fools always tryin' to fix shit that ain't broken
I'm down with pixies so you don't want to see me
So, grab everyone in your crew and disappear like a genie
Never said I was the best but I ain't the one to be testin'
Cross the line and in pieces you'll be destined
Don't stop, get it, get it
'Cause I blow up the spot every time I grab the mic and hit it, hit it

[Chorus: x3]",Can U Dig It,1997
Coolio,"Verse 1:
If you free your mind your ass has got to 
But you're caught up in that same ol' patent and trap that the homies go through
Searchin' for answers without no questions
You thought it could never happen to you and your crew, but y'all was no exception
It started out as fun and it was all about kicks (Kicks)
But each and every kick turned out to be a trick
Imagine this you got no family, you got no ends
You got no hustle, no muscle, no car, no clothes, you got no friends
You once was the neighborhood boss and hog
And no G livin' legend like walkin' dogs
Niggaz hate to admit it, but they know it's true
Damn near everybody in the hood, includin' the kids, want to be just like you
So, hear I stand as a witness, or, should I say a reclaimed victim
Written off and spit on by this really sick ass system 
You can roll what I roll in the swirl from the smoke
Somebody take a vote, the devil is dope

Chorus:
The devil is dope (Dope)
Out of control
The devil is dope
The devil is dope
Out to get your soul (Yeah-yeah)
The devil is dope

Verse 2:
Things seen only imagined and in dreams
Until, the same nightmares in tv screens your teenage screams (Ahh!)
Cause the dosage wasn't right 
Now his chest is gettin' tight
And everything is goin' black
But it's the middle of the day, figure that
But you still can't see with a thousand watt beam (Blind!)
And you need mo gin to feed your triple beam with schemes (Wake up!)
Cause traffic done slowed up like the one ten at five
So, you dance the street section at around two, to try to stay alive
And now you trapped tryin' to play hockey with some tic tac's (Tic Tac's!)
And niggaz tellin' you to kick back and bend back, but you already did that
And all money ain't good money
But everybody want the cream and honey
Thinkin' that the other side is all green plus it's sunny (Yeah!)
But, money, lust, and jealousy most lead to treachery
From A.C. to O.G. to P.G. to P.C.B. 
As you call for your locs, set adrift in the smoke
It's like murder, heat, smoke, the devil is dope

Chorus

Verse 3: 
Sunshine on your mind but darkness prevails
You move your sales from motel to hotel
Prerequisite for a blast, merchandise, cash, or ass
Bloodshed often is the door where personalaties crash
And it's your task to try to make a meal ticket
So, you can kick it and be swift with your chicken (Bock-bock!)
You's a victim and since you got your own mind
It ain't all your fault, but you gotta do your own time
Choose your weapon cause your first impression
Often dictates the situation that you find yourself caught in
If you still blind and you can't see 
You better obtain yourself some glasses and clear your vision like DMC (Don't run!)
And remember what I told you
Remember who brought a soldier
I want to wake you up like Sega
consume large amounts of dank-a
Man overboard
Beware of the underlords
Stay your ass on the boat, the devil is dope (Ooh-ooh!)

Coolio,"A homeboy is somebody that got your back 
Whether you right or wrong 
Somebody that excepts you for what you are 
Not what you got on  what you can do for them 

If you lucky enough to have some then 
You know what I'm talkin bout 

Friends  how many of us have them 
And not that many 
The chances of meeting someone these days you can trust is skinny 
But  it seems there really ain't a damn thing you can do 

'Cause since the seventies, it seems everybody been rolling with a crew 
A team, a gang, a posse, or some type-a click 
And if your firm ain't thick 
Then your squad becomes vixed 

Be extra careful or the ones you call your partna 
'Cause what they really is, is a busta out to rob ya 
And, be weary of strangers bearing your God and gifts 
And a wolf in sheeps clothing 

'Cause some of y'all ain't knowing 
Me and you go back like roaches in the projects 
And, we done been through things they still ain't even thought of yet 
A good homie is hard to come by

That I would of smoked if i would of had a Tek 9 
But, here I stand as a man, and I'm free to say 
I'm hella glad that my momma didn't raise me that way 

And the homies I grew up with 
Locs I threw up with 
Is the kind of fools that you don't want to buck with 
Why does it seem that the good brothers die 

And the evil brothers live 
And prosper and multiply 
Pass the Hennessey to the left hand side 
Want some many dirt for the homies that expired 

I hope you rest in peace 
And, when it's time for my release 
I'll meet you at the crossroads dippin in the low-low 
But, until then I'ma keep my rolls slow 

My flow on tight, and stay rollin with the 4-0 
This is comin from the one and only 
And like MC Shan said, ""I'll never leave you lonely""

Me and you is like family 
And everybody know that we go back to back 
And we go toe to toe 
Comin' from the west 

Where the sets run thick 
Where brothers either bang or try to make a grip 
I cross my heart and hope to die 
I never lie 

I run out on mine 
Anywhere or anytime 
Me and my homies don't get involved with that he say, she say 
But, if you've lost you'll receive a ass whippin with your instant replay 

Or, deckin like Tekken 
So, show some respect when respect is given to you 
And, watch out for the forty too 
Fake curve 

And fools who got the nerve 
To pretend that they was down 
When last month they wadn't even around 
West coast, East coast, and worldwide 

My homies in the pen, and my homies that lived and died 
I'm still the same little nappy head brother from the eastside 
And, you can call me homeboy

The running gets faster, the man is breathing faster, and he sounds 
terrified.  The devil's laughing is getting much louder

When night falls over the city

It's ten o'clock and darkness covers my area
And every night it's gettin a little bit more scarier
The eleven o'clock Monday news is mo like a horror flick 
People sure have changed, it seems that they enjoying this
Death and destruction
With no instruction
Leads to malfunction, disruption, and full consumption
How can I escape this mind state that I'm in?
I been tryin, but it seems that I can't win
I've fallen and I can't get up
And the homies that was my homies went and set me up
Somebody tried to tell me that it was all in my brain
I tried to act a hard male runnin cocaine
But it still don't ease my pain
Am I insane or a victim of my own fears?
What's goin on we supposed to be happy here
God don't make no junk that's what I been told
But it seems to me that God ain't in control

Verse 2:
I need assistance, but all I get is resistance
I try to be persistent, but life can be gone in an instant
I'm scared to turn around cause I know somebody's watching
I can feel they evil stares, and I know that they plottin on me
And scheamin, I wish I was dreamin
If my mind was free I could chase away the demons
But in ain't, and they still can't understand that
All I ever wanted in life was a chance to be a man
The same old pattern has got me goin crazy, loc
Descendent of a king, but I feel like a royal joke 
Is this a sequel?
Are all men created equal?
The lies you told to the people back then now they is lethal
And now we swimmin in a pool like shark bait (Like shark bait!)
Feel my pulse race, abnormal heart rate (Heart rate!)
And now I'm startin to feel like I might come up missin
I tried to tell somebody but nobody wouldn't listen

Verse 3:  
I'm feelin oppressed, this stifle
My life is trifle
No family, friends, or relations, so I sleep with my rifle
And my pistol, I'm seein stars and hearin whistles
One shot from a little junky ass twenty-two will tear a whole in your gristle
won't stay to state side 
Cause the unpure fall off the fall by the way side
So stay your ass on the plate side
There's nothin to fear but the fear itself
And if you control the fear then the fear is wealth
Do I have power or do I have no self control?
These long, lonely nights have made my heart grow cold
Hear my pleads, can somebody help a G
And, will we fight this battle for eternity
I blame you cause my mind is not my own
So, don't blame me if I trespass in yo zone

Another Saturday night, and I'm feelin kinda slothy
I'm down with the forty, but I don't want no forty
Even though I'm thirsty and I'm hungry, I need some Kurathers
Peep this, but not up in my stomach
I want to chop your cherry tree, I can't tell a lie
Somethings on the rise, what a surprise
I called up the homies and said, ""Let's go the spot!""
Where the drinks are cold, and the girls ain't too hot
Now we in the house, but the house is kinda empty 
Rats run around the room
But, wait, I spoke too soon
Ah, damn, look what done walked in
Pumps and a bump, breath smellin like gin
Baby, you look good with that blue dress on
Maybe some day me and you can be as one
Let's get to know each other better
I can sing you a song, and you can write me a love letter

Chorus:  

Baby, you can do it, take your time, do it right (Let's do it, get to it)
You can do it, baby, baby (Let's do it, get to it)
Baby, you can do it, take your time, do it right (Let's do it, get to it)
You can do it, baby, baby (Let's do it, get to it)

Verse 2: 

Damn, I'm feelin frisky
Come and sit down wit me
Conversate about hanky panky
And a little dranky wanky
Tell me bout your innermost thoughts, wants, neeeds and your desires
And I'll tell you about mine
We can spend some quality time
You want a man with vision, who ain't afraid to listen
I want to mention I can hit that ass in thirty-six positions
And, I just want a regular old fashion high hoochie mama 
With love for her daddy, anytime he want it
Bring home the turkey bacon and fry it in the pan
Or, some filet minon and still let me know I'm the man
I'm the doctor, and you can play the nurse
But we got to have patience
Even though we hella anxious
Let's take it slow and proceed with caution
Cause love just don't come round here too often
So take my number, and we'll get together later
And I'll take yours, I'm out like the L.A. Raiders

Chorus

Verse 3:

A few months went by with phone calls and some dinners
Moonlit nights with Marvin Gaye, Dramatics, and The Spinners
Top down on the Vette watching California sunsets
And pretty soon we developed that respect
That we needed so we was here to get the relationship heated
And hot and bothered, no what I'm meanin?
It started slow with some kisses and some touches
A few more weeks went by cause we didn't want to rush it
They say a fast horse don't win no races
And I'm a witness cause real winners always take steady paces
Hand in hand, woman to man
I know everything about her and she know everything about me and
We made love for the first time 
In the right way, in the perfect state of mind
It's a whole lot mo than your average bump 'n grind
You better get yours, cause I got mine

You can try to throw salt, but I keep my game face on
And the only thing on your mind is stalkin' more digits than a telephone
Me and thirty-nine thieves jumpin' out of white Hummer
From Compton (Wooh-wooh-wooh), while your crew get dumb and dumber
Grew up straight out of low cash like CB fo'
Now I got dough and you got one night stands like gangsta, yo
See on the low it's all gravy
But the threat of this new world order is about to drive me crazy
And all you want is the Lex and gold Visa
Bomb singles and stackin' your chips like Pringles
While my rhymes jack for platinum plaques
Quicker than one time Jack Black's
I twist sacks and sip yac
Plus, the Invisible Man got my back like a spine
So, why you all up in mine?
Keep the money and the fame cause all I really want to hold

It's a small world, after all, you're clausterphobic, you can't breathe
So, store your ball like Christopher Reeve
It's the hater in you that makes you criticize me
Cause if you handled your business then yo ass would see
Nineteen-ninety-seven is still crackin'

On the trunk, on the hood, and it's all good

And I'll work extra duty to please your coochie
You can lay me on the bed and cuff me up
Spread honey on my chest, but don't rough me up
Dig your nails in my back, girl, play yo game
You never come the same if we say yo name

If there be a dope beat then all y'all see

Freak yo physique and you betta not compete
Make it hot and sweaty like twenty deep in a jeep
Never comin' cheap, forty creep

I steal money from the rich 
And give it to the poor, it's

Now hump, do the stomp to the butt

And I never knew the meaning of the word ""defeat""
The master of disguise want to see the people's eyes
Yet, fools try to deny that the ?man? can fly
Just cook 'em all up like gumbo
And block their ass like Mutumbo
Cause your album dropped off the charts like Dumbo
We are new and improved to make you put on your boogie shoes
Like K.C. and the Sunshine Band, or the Wu-Tang Clan
I go way back like Vegas, Nixon, Noreaga
It's the tennis shoe players fat box on the quiet station
Now what if hip hop was like Humpty Dumpty sittin' on the wall
And what if hip hop had to take a great fall
And what if rhyme was a crime   
And each and every time
That you spit a dope line
You might have to do some time
Most of these clowns will be tryin' to skip town
But Coolio will be ready for the showdown

Verse 3:
If the shoe fit, put it on and stick
And if your ass uncash don't let your mouth write no check
Fools be in the bars unadvanced with a switch
Uppercuts and fight kicks with Weird Al Yankovich
From Tokyo to Sojo, rollin wit the 4-0
This hip hop that I'm holdin' I'll make it move your hoe
It's the Vandino, everything but rhyme's broken
Breakin' a nigga with first position at the open
You can't understand how I do it
I'm just true to it
I let my pen flow across the paper like it was made affluent
Uh, let it ring, let it rip
Everybody holler like Marvin Gaye, but don't you let the record skip
Synchronize the watch, cause the party don't stop
Till the neighborhood watch call the cops
It's the wild ass festival, coast line veteran
Once again droppin' bombs on yo section (On yo section)

You know what I'm talkin' bout

Friends, how many of us have them
And not that many
The chances of meeting someone these days you can trust is skinny
But, it seems there really ain't a damn thing you can do
'Cause since the seventies, it seems everybody been rolling with a crew

A team, a gang, a posse, or some type-a click
And if your firm ain't thick
Then your squad becomes vixed
Be extra careful or the ones you call your partna

'Cause what they really is, is a busta out to rob ya
And, be weary of strangers bearing your God and gifts
And a wolf in sheeps clothing
'Cause some of why'all ain't knowing

And, we done been through things they still ain't even thought of yet
A good homie is hard to come by

I'm hell of glad that my momma didn't raise me that way

And the homies I grew up with 
Locs I threw up with
Is the kind of fools that you don't want to buck with
Why does it seem that the good brothers die

And the evil brothers live
And prosper and multiply
Pass the Hennessey to the left hand side
Want some many dirt for the homies that expired

I hope you rest in peace
And, when it's time for my release
I'll meet you at the crossroads dippin in the low-low
But, until then I'ma keep my rolls slow 

My flow on tight, and stay rollin with the 4-0
This is comin from the one and only

Where brothers either bang or try to make a grip
I cross my heart and hope to die
I never lie

I run out on mine
Anywhere or anytime
Me and my homies don't get involved with that he say, she say
But, if you've lost you'll receive a a** whippin with your instant replay

Or, deckin like Tekken
So, show some respect when respect is given to you
And, watch out for the forty too
Fake curve

And fools who got the nerve
To pretend that they was down
When last month they wadn't even around 
West coast, East coast, and worldwide

My homies in the pen, and my homies that lived and died
I'm still the same little nappy head brother from the eastside

The eleven o'clock Monday news is mo like a horror flick

Death and destruction
With no instruction
Leads to malfunction, disruption, and full consumption
How can I escape this mind state that I'm in?

I've fallen and I can't get up

Somebody tried to tell me that it was all in my brain

I tried to act a hard male runnin' cocaine
But it still don't ease my pain
Am I insane or a victim of my own fears?
What's goin' on we supposed to be happy here

God don't make no junk that's what I been told
But it seems to me that God ain't in control

[Chorus: x2]

I need assistance, but all I get is resistance
I try to be persistent, but life can be gone in an instant
I'm scared to turn around cause I know somebody's watching
I can feel they evil stares, and I know that they plottin' on me

And scheamin', I wish I was dreamin'
If my mind was free I could chase away the demons
But in ain't, and they still can't understand that
All I ever wanted in life was a chance to be a man

The same old pattern has got me goin' crazy, loc
Descendent of a king, but I feel like a royal joke 
Is this a sequel?
Are all men created equal?

The lies you told to the people back then now they is lethal
And now we swimmin' in a pool like shark bait (Like shark bait!)
Feel my pulse race, abnormal heart rate (Heart rate!)
And now I'm startin' to feel like I might come up missin'
I tried to tell somebody but nobody wouldn't listen

[Chorus: x2]

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooohhhh

I'm feelin' oppressed, this stifle
My life is trifle
No family, friends, or relations, so I sleep with my rifle
And my pistol, I'm seein' stars and hearin' whistles

One shot from a little junky a** twenty-two will tear a whole in your gristle
won't stay to state side 
'Cause the unpure fall off the fall by the way side
So stay your a** on the plate side

There's nothin to fear but the fear itself
And if you control the fear then the fear is wealth
Do I have power or do I have no self control?
These long, lonely nights have made my heart grow cold

Hear my pleads, can somebody help a G
And, will we fight this battle for eternity
I blame you cause my mind is not my own
So, don't blame me if I trespass in yo zone

I'm your creation
The product of a twisted nation
Guess this is what you're facin (Facin!)

[Chorus: x4]

When night falls over the city
I gotta be ready cause it feels like 
Somebody's comin' to get me (Comin' to get me, get me, get me, get me, get me)

Another Saturday night, and I'm feelin' kinda slothy
I'm down with the forty, but I don't want no forty
Even though I'm thirsty and I'm hungry, I need some Kurathers
Peep this, but not up in my stomach
I want to chop your cherry tree, I can't tell a lie
Somethings on the rise, what a surprise
I called up the homies and said, ""Let's go the spot!""
Where the drinks are cold, and the girls ain't too hot
Now we in the house, but the house is kinda empty 
Rats run around the room
But, wait, I spoke too soon
Ah, damn, look what done walked in
Pumps and a bump, breath smellin' like gin
Baby, you look good with that blue dress on
Maybe some day me and you can be as one
Let's get to know each other better
I can sing you a song, and you can write me a love letter

[Chorus:] 

Baby, you can do it, take your time, do it right (Let's do it, get to it)
You can do it, baby, baby (Let's do it, get to it)
Baby, you can do it, take your time, do it right (Let's do it, get to it)
You can do it, baby, baby (Let's do it, get to it)


Damn, I'm feelin' frisky
Come and sit down wit me
Converse about hanky panky
And a little dranky wanky
Tell me bout your innermost thoughts, wants, needs and your desires
And I'll tell you about mine
We can spend some quality time
You want a man with vision, who ain't afraid to listen
I want to mention I can hit that ass in thirty-six positions
And, I just want a regular old fashion high hoochie mama 
With love for her daddy, anytime he want it
Bring home the turkey bacon and fry it in the pan
Or, some filet minon and still let me know I'm the man
I'm the doctor, and you can play the nurse
But we got to have patience
Even though we hella anxious
Let's take it slow and proceed with caution
Cause love just don't come round here too often
So take my number, and we'll get together later
And I'll take yours, I'm out like the L.A. Raiders

[Chorus:]

A few months went by with phone calls and some dinners
Moonlit nights with Marvin Gaye, Dramatics, and The Spinners
Top down on the Vette watching California sunsets
And pretty soon we developed that respect
That we needed so we was here to get the relationship heated
And hot and bothered, no what I'm meanin'
It started slow with some kisses and some touches
A few more weeks went by cause we didn't want to rush it
They say a fast horse don't win no races
And I'm a witness cause real winners always take steady paces
Hand in hand, woman to man
I know everything about her and she know everything about me and
We made love for the first time 
In the right way, in the perfect state of mind
It's a whole lot mo than your average bump 'n grind
You better get yours, cause I got mine

You can try to throw salt, but I keep my game face on
And the only thing on your mind is stalkin' more digits than a telephone
Me and thirty-nine thieves jumpin' out of white Hummer
From Compton (Wooh-wooh-wooh), while your crew get dumb and dumber
Grew up straight out of low cash like CB fo'
Now I got dough and you got one night stands like gangsta, yo
See on the low it's all gravy
But the threat of this new world order is about to drive me crazy
And all you want is the Lex and gold Visa
Bomb singles and stackin' your chips like Pringles
While my rhymes jack for platinum plaques
Quicker than one time Jack Black's
I twist sacks and sip yac
Plus, the Invisible Man got my back like a spine
So, why you all up in mine?
Keep the money and the fame cause all I really want to hold
Is my artistic flavor and control of my soul

[Chorus]

Ain't no tellin
Most women are still waitin' and sellin'
Most of my homies is ex-felons (Convicts)
In two decades, rap went from Planet Rock
To crack rock  
Now, everybody got a glock
And it don't stop
Till another brother drop
That's why I poured out a little drink for the homie Pac (Rest In Peace)
What's a thin line between love and hate?
A million dollars in the bank and you still can't escape
It's a small world, after all, you're claustrophobic, you can't breathe
So, store your ball like Christopher Reeve
It's the hater in you that makes you criticize me
Cause if you handled your business then yo ass would see
Nineteen-ninety-seven is still crackin' 
I'ma get the ladies out their seat like this was a car jackin'
They say the game is to be sold, not told
You can keep your bankroll, I want control of my soul

[Chorus]

My jaws flip across sixteen bars like Dominique Dawes
But without no flaws, never broke a m.c. law
See, I was servin' wack rappers at the school
When Bruce Lee was scrappin' with Kareem Abdul
You got into triple beams and guns you ain't gon shoot
I seen a million rappers in the same Versace suit
Or, the same pair of locs, that's probably why you're broke
And your backstage and your ghetto pass got revoked
Scrappin' or rappin' what you want to happen?
If I ever come up short you the first one I'm jackin'
It's thieves in the area like aircraft carrier's
We're launchin' F-15's 
And Anti-Wack Maf Machines
Michropone, sittin' on my vocal chord
Sendin' busta's to the crossroads like Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the see-O-O-L-I-O, well I, won't fold 
When I'm controllin' my soul

Pull up your skirt and we can do it on the pool table
Your nipples look so tender 
Can I twirl 'em in my mouth like a blender, surrender

Are you sure that we alone, all alone? (Yeah!)
Lock the door and unplug the telephone (Telephone!)
Light some candles let me get a look at your handles (Ooh-wee!)
You got a body like a sex scandal
So, I puts the cotton ball in the Q-Tip patch
Turn around and let me see you from the back, ah shat! (Damn!)
You know you bring out the freak in me
I go deep in the peak, I hope you think of me
Whenever you need some sexual healing 
We like two in a million
Don't fight the feelin
You ain't dealin with no rookie
Yes I got a lot of nuts in my Tollhouse cookie
Call up your bookie, put your money on the cement
I'm puttin in work like a tag team free man
I spark through the woods like a Recon
And we can do it all night with the lights on

What's up on some lovin, babay?
We can roll in my sixty-three
And drink Hennessy
What's up on some lovin, babay?
Don't you want to roll with me?
You and me can cream

We can put it on a platter, girl, it don't matter
I make it hot and you can pop it like a firecracker
In the bedroom, bathroom, livin room
Outside in the yard, it's a full moon
In the car, in the front seat, back seat
On the trunk, on the hood, and it's all good
I'll be the piece and you can be the booty
And I'll work extra duty to please your coochie
You can lay me on the bed and cuff me up
Spread honey on my chest, but don't rough me up
Dig your nails in my back, girl, play yo game
You never come the same if we say yo name
Is it real or a dream
You make me scream
When you rub my body with shaving cream
Stick your tongue down my throat and give me a kiss (Mmm-waah!)
'Cause you know it don't get no better than this (That's right!)

[Chorus:]

Are you ready to throw down?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to
And shake your ass on the carpet like the old school
Are you ready to throw down?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to 
And give a loc a little dap when he walks through

If there be a dope beat then all why'all see
Get up out your seat and let me see yo technique
Freak yo physique and you betta not compete
Make it hot and sweaty like twenty deep in a jeep
Never comin' cheap, forty creep
And I hope you don't mind if I borrow a few things while you go to sleep
I steal money from the rich 

And give it to the poor, it's
Coolio loco and ghetto witch doctor super, you are
Bring it from the back and bring it to the front
'Cause you gotta give the people what they want
Now hump, do the stomp to the butt

Big homie shake your gut
As long as you get your ass up
It's a party over here
And let me make it clear
40 Thevz is the crew 
So you better come anew
Ain't a damn thing change since the first one
And if you didn't hear the album go get one (One)

Are you ready to throw down?

Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to
And give a loc a little dap when he walks through.

Here come the thief on the old school beat
And I never knew the meaning of the word ""defeat""
The master of disguise want to see the people's eyes
Yet, fools try to deny that the ?man? can fly
Just cook 'em all up like gumbo
And block their ass like Mutumbo
Cause your album dropped off the charts like Dumbo

We are new and improved to make you put on your boogie shoes
Like K.C. and the Sunshine Band, or the Wu-Tang Clan
I go way back like Vegas, Nixon, Noreaga
It's the tennis shoe players fat box on the quiet station
Now what if hip hop was like Humpty Dumpty sittin' on the wall
And what if hip hop had to take a great fall
And what if rhyme was a crime   
And each and every time
That you spit a dope line
You might have to do some time
Most of these clowns will be tryin' to skip town
But Coolio will be ready for the showdown

If the shoe fit, put it on and stick
And if your ass uncash don't let your mouth write no check
Fools be in the bars unadvanced with a switch
Uppercuts and fight kicks with Weird Al Yankovic
From Tokyo to Sojo, rollin wit the 4-0
This hip hop that I'm holdin' I'll make it move your hoe
It's the Vandino, everything but rhyme's broken
Breakin' a nigga with first position at the open

You can't understand how I do it
I'm just true to it
I let my pen flow across the paper like it was made affluent
Uh, let it ring, let it rip
Everybody holler like Marvin Gaye, but don't you let the record skip
Synchronize the watch, cause the party don't stop
Till the neighborhood watch call the cops
It's the wild ass festival, coast line veteran
Once again droppin' bombs on yo section (On yo section)

His little girl's just now taking training wheels off her bike
While her daddy's got twenty-five to life at Fort Strike
The little homey just tripped and stripped

Because he didn't realize that the joint was dipped
That's right
OG's joining the nation and it's all good
Big G's is retaliating cause they enemies are crossed out the hood

Crackhead momma's smoking whole accounting checks
Dopedealers who serve liquor pieces for sex
Be your own good ride
Right right

These are the geto highlights
Young niggas going to school to be a doctor
Late night sounds of gunshots and helicopters
Be your own good ride

Right right
These are the ghetto highlights

To all the motherfuckers who think their shit don't stank
Rollin D.B.s and then appear for robbing banks
Be your own good ride
Right right

These are the ghetto highlights
This is just a little something for a nigga
That's still gonna be a nigga if he don't get no bigger
Be your own good ride

Right right
These are the ghetto highlights

Coolio,"Hey baby how you doin' What's goin' on? 
I'm sittin' in my motherf***in' cell it's the same song 
Tell my kids that I love em but don't tell em that I'm through 
Keep cryin' and tell em I'll be home soon 

Oh baby I'm goin' crazy 
'Cause I keep seein' s*** that amaze me 
Still I had to kill a motherf***er last week 
He thought I was a punk and tried to creep up on me in my sleep 

I just think that I could hold or squeeze or touch or buck ya 
but I can't, so f*** it 
I'm a behind these bars and it's burnin' like nitro 
I might go psycho, the man on the tower got a rifle 

Aw s***, there the lights go.... 
 
(Hello) 

[Chorus]
Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta (damn) 
Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta (y'know) 
Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta and I know he's a killer 
but I love dat n**** 
Bridge: LeShaun 
Hey ba-by 
What's happenin' honey? 
How you doin'? 
I miss you 
 
The kids keep askin' where's their papa? 
I had to tell em daddy got caught by the coppers 
It's time for me to raise em up proper by myself 
It's a goddamn struggle when a b**** ain't got no help 

Now everybody tellin' me that you ain't s*** black 
and when you get out, you'll jack and probably go right the f*** back 
Damn, the pressure's gettin' hot and heavy 
and yeah, I'm gettin' sweated by your homey in the blue and white Chevy 

But now he's got a condo and a brand new Lexus 
Wants me to take a trip with him down to Texas 
The ends don't justify the means 
and in another life he might've been the man of my dreams 

But you know I got your back to the motherf***in end 
but a b**** can't even trip like she doesn't have a friend 

[Chorus] 
 
(Hello, you have a collect call from...) 
Coolio! 
(If you choose to accept this call please press 5 now) 
 
What the f*** you mean you need a friend? 
I can't be havin' no n****s round my kids 
Don't you make me break up outta this motherf***er 
and start killin' motherf***ers, S***! 

I know it's rough, I know it's tough 
but when you fumble in the game sometimes you get locked up 
You better stay away punk a** b****, he ain't s*** 
I don't want to have to kill him 

'Cause think about the times that we used to have 
Don't make me reach out and touch that a** 
You put yourself in danger when you f*** with a buster 
Like shootin' dice without a pistol in a circle of murderers 

You got more class than the average-type hooker b**** 
Don't switch, he gotta grip but he ain't rich 
Now I gotta check but if you've got the cheque 
Give a n**** a look and put somethin' on my books 

Peace 

[Chorus]

Ah-yo remember the homey with the Lexus, he took the trip to Texas 
now he's wearin' the f***in Lexus like a necklace 
So tell me, what's the drill, baby pa? What's a b**** to do? 
My n****'s stretched in the pen since '92 

Them visits ain't doin' the trick, drop f***s make me sick 
'Cause this po' puddy-tat needs a cat nip 
And that motherf***er representin' you, I think he resents you 
He got evidence he never presents to 

The people in court, I heard witnesses abortin' 
What's he doin' about gettin' you out to hold the fort? 
I got some ends, I'm a send you a dime and two doves 
Mama hates you but damn I got love for a gangsta

We breakin up, Monday and Tuesday
We blowing up Wednesday and Thursday
She shake it up Friday and Saturday
I beat it up all day on Sunday

[Verse 1]
It was on the very first time that I met her
That leather was fittin that ass and that skin tight sweater
Was curvin around that body and I painted a picture
In my mind I wrote a letter bout us getting together
Green eyes dark hair honey brown complextion 
I was rollin in a bucket she was rollin a lexus
I sweat it now we can do the damn thang if she want to
If she don't I'm just satisfied with bendin some cornas
Drink coronas just as long as she don't leave me alona
I can name fifty niggas now that wanted to bone her 
But they didn't I'm happy bout the place that I'm sittin
Didn't buy shit my name is still on her kitten
Written in platinum she don't just love me for rappin and actin
She love my mind the way I'm dippin in matchin
My blackness, her reactions are like fatal attractions
she jackin and blastin and ridin for the man that she's rackin

[Chorus 2]
We breakin up, Monday and Tuesday
We blowin up Wednesday and Thursday
She shake it up Friday and Saturday
I beat it up all day on Sunday
So shake it up (shake it up)
Do yo thang little mamma shake it up (shake it up)
Bend over touch yo toes and shake it up (shake it up)
I like the way you move now shake it up (shake it up)
Just shake shake shake shake shake (shake)

[Verse 2]
She my main squeeze only thing maintained
Sometime tha that shit I be sayin she the only one that understand
She my boo my freak i know that I'm her main man
So fuck these hos and bullshit niggas with these same games
I let my chain hang and still claim the same thang
And even when she don't love me I'm the same main
Nigga that she call when she need somebody to talk to
Hit her from the back eat and walk wit her
She got a lot to offer look what she brought with her
She got brains and taps that leave niggas that start wit her
She don't care about houses cars sex and bling bling 
Even though nine and half inches is a big thang
She ain't the type that be creepin and sleepin and jumpin in other niggas jeepin
When I'm outta town on business 
When I'm on a mission to put us in a position 
Where we don't have to do nothin but show the love and kick it listen

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]",Shake It Up,2002
Coolio,"[Verse 1]
Imagine looking at life through rose-tinted glasses
And the policy of the people is passive
And all the women got fat asses
And all the homies got dubs and deeds to spend
And when the po-po's pass they wave and say ""hi""
And wear a grin (hey)
And everybody that you meet is a potential friend
And the women in your life love you for yourself and not your ends
And the population's real so there's no reason to pretend
And ignore we are the same, so no one hates you for the colour of your skin
And every waking thought is one of peace and harmony and bliss
That simple satisfaction like a plate of eggs and grits
Senses fully alive like the feeling of a first kiss
And when it's check out time you got a smile on your lips, huh
And the whole world is like your next-door neighbour
Quick to do you a favour even though we come in a million different flavours
And I know there's not enough time to put it all in one rhyme
So I savour the flavour and sweet taste I feel from the rays of the sunshine

[Chorus - Woman singing]
Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii'm sittin in the sunshine
The sunshine, like the world was mine, the sunshine
Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii'm walkin in the sunshine
The sunshine, like the world was mine, the sunshine

[Verse 2]
If love was a flower I'd spread the petals about the planet
And plant seeds throughout every city and country
Even in those who do not want me
I try to make some sense of the situation that we call life
Some, verbal illustration to help ease this strife
Some, lyrical penetration to try to make things right
In hopes that what I'm saying can saturate your mindframe
And help you with the pain and the strain of the everyday struggle
I don't need it all, I want to see all y'all bubble
And rise to the top then prove to be hard like a rock
'cause you know it don't stop unless we let it all stop
So when you face to face with adversity, just curse him, see
And look him in the eye, and let him know, that he can't hurt a G
And that you willin' ta risk it all
For the things of people that you believe in
So educate yourself in order to assess your achievements
And if I had to explain this realer so you could see it in your mind -
I guess it's kinda like sunshine

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Before I continue let me make one thing clear
Took me a while but there's three things I learned to put before my self and career
God, family and my fans
I wish that I could hold your hand
And be like Moses, part the Red Sea and lead you to the promised land
Our demons blazin, and it feels amazin
I can lay here till I'm old and grey and shrivelled like a raisin
Throughout the years 'n months 'n days
When life used to pass by in a daze
And I was posted simply gettin faded, just waitin
Livin life with the eye for nothing but cold steel, fast cash and hot payment
Impatient to be a baller and roll a SS on Daytons
And now I'm here and I promise to get my whole soul, mind, body and spirit
And try to lift every voice and rhyme loud as hell so all y'all can hear it
And still remember the words from that old hip-hop spiritual
I'm livin in a Gangsta Paradise and I hope y'all remember too
And even though it's west coast eastside Compton on mine
It's ok 'cause I don't mind if you share some of my sunshine

[Chorus] x2

I'm diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiyin before they take away my sunshine
I ain't lyin (sunshine)
I'll be diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiyin before they take away my sunshine
And I ain't lyin (sunshine)

I'm a menace to those
Who talk shit and not mention the flow
I gas it up then it's a go
Until the wheels fall off engine explodes
Every months' paycheck got a few O's
To the damn Matrix got a few new foes
Every second I got, I try to live me up
The harder the work the better the odds
I intend to rock the truth and sell
And not go prostitute myself
Fuck if that's stressin' me
Clock tic tocs and it's too late to bring back yesterday
So I invade your playlist
Make kids turn it up and wake the neighbors
And take the numbers that create the matrix
And get them placed on my paychecks
What!? let's go.

You know why?

Get a clear view
Who is that dipping in the six in ya rear view
It's that loca used to be a smoker
But now he's got a dime on his shoulder
And he's a soldier
The price of fame
And the pressure of the game
Went may for the week in the membrane
So I'm staying the hay
Cause brother has changed
Mad at me coz' I'm rollin on a trip of fame
Grab your pen and grap your paper
Grap the heater off the table and pull that caper
Stack your chips up and save some for later
Do me a favor and watch your neighbour
If you got a problem then bite like a ghetta'
Show him you know sheep
Show him you got teeth
Show him you don't sleep
Tell him you're pu mardi
And they gotta break bad if they wont believe
Don't sleep

'Cause the bird he was with wouldn't stop squawking
She juggling five cats and they all lost in
The illusion of love that she used for profit
The usual topic chickens and benjamins
You supposed to be my kin Mexican or Asian European or Korean or Jamaican
Makes no difference
Our existence is still shared between us in essence

Yes the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had
Take me away
'Cause the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had

Show some love for your brothers and sisters
Show some love for the whole wide world
Show some love for your enemies and frenemies
Show some love for the rejects on the street
Show some love for the whole wide world

'Cause the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had

If the world is bad refer to your dad
And his before four score what's the reason he saw for
Karma is real part of the deal when's how you started the deal
'Cause everything is 360
It will start the cartwheel
And snowballs so don't forget now cause I told y'all
Dead the 'cause all it do is hold y'all captive
All in the world you're trapped in
Relaxing you can't feel what's happening
I deal with facts man
I was at the crossroads dealing with lost souls that couldn't cross though
Lost hope off dope
Out to jostle
Any unweary traveler that would fall the talk show
It's foul how they play it
But you can't stray to show love take
Courage and strength and realize we ain't sure as we think you know

The world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had
Take me away
Yes the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had

So down I want to go
So cold I have to go
So down I need to go
So cold as I go

'Cause the world's gone crazy
Even though love no more
Show love, show love, show show love
Show love, show love, show love

All because of that bitch, another tale with some murder
About this nigga who came up, that you heard of
She got in the game, got him a name, and some clout
And put down a lick, by shootiing his boss in his mouth
He stole his money, hid the body when he covered it
Peepin for his part, so nobody would discover it
Went to his crib, found his safe with the knot
And counted it out, to place it in his stash spot
The shit was unbearable, he scored 100 G's
Plus the nigga's boss had about 20 ki's
Then he cooked them up and got some workers on his team
Since he had the dope, it put his face on the scene
Went into his stash, and bought a fresh ride
All within a week, he sowed up the South side
5 to 10 G's, every minute on the hour
Money stacked so high, quite resemblin a tower
Along with the ends, when it came, you should know
He thought she was sweet, but was a gold-diggin ho
Now who's down with that bitch?

Chorus:
My woman, digs for money, day and night
My woman, loves me, and she holds me tight
My woman, better come on, home tonight
'cause if she don't, I'm gone beat that ass all night

(Coop MC)
50 G's, by the end of every day
Been working for a month, so the nigga had to pay
She started ?big-sensing?, 'cause she thought he had it made
Trickin on that bitch kept his workers unpaid
She told him ""Forget 'em"", 'cause his friends wouldn't matter
Today it was fat, but yesterday his grip was fatter
The game was sweet, the bitch played her cards right
The nigga was dumb, he let the money change his life
And what was a dollar, now today is a penny
Did she take a little, or did she take plenty?
She fucked him at 5, so by 8 he was 'sleep
And rob him at 9, so by 10 she could creep
And short on his dope, and the 100 G's too
But didn't blame the bitch because he thought she was true
He called up his moms, and questioned her about the money
She started to laugh, he said ""This shit ain't funny!""
So he threatened her life, and said he'd kill her his self
But down came his door, it was the ATF
All because of that bitch

Chorus
(Coop MC)
Called up his girl, to come and get him out the bucket
She answered the phone, he heard a nigga saying ""Suck it""
He said it was me, ""Baby come and get me quick!""
But couldn't reply, with her mouth full of dick
He said it again, ""Would you come and pick me up?""
Replied ""Yes"", funny 'cause her throat was full of nut
And one hour later, she went down to bail him out
Ain't havin no money, so she took him to his house
He got on the phone, and called this nigga who was pumpin
And asked if he could, would the nigga front him somethin
??? business, but they done it face-to-face
Met up at Weiss, and passed the black briefcase
Called up his girl, said tonight there he will sleep
Not even knowin that some niggas had him peeped
And went to her crib, so he could see what he was fronted
4 niggas in a blue Seville, nigga-huntin
They creeped up slow, one nigga said he knew the house
Went to the back, and saw the couple on the couch
His first day out, was the last of his life
The nigga was murdered, by the thieves of the night
All because of that bitch

Chorus",My Woman,1995
Cooper Tisdale,"Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Cooter,"As I kick myself again
And I try to pick myself back up again
Don't want to make the same mistake
Always the first with an excuse
But it's when you're cornered by the truth
Sometimes its easier that way

As you turn away
When realization stares you down
And you swear you've come to terms I'm weary
I've seen it all too many times

It never made much sense
So I always had to stop an second guess
Defeat myself before I start
Comfort seems so far away
Peace of mind is just a luxury
Forgetting is the hardest part

It's not what you say matters
Because anyone could say those words to me
You say that I lack compassion
But that's when my first reaction
Isn't how you wanted me to be

And spending all my days without you
I know sometimes that
It doesn't work that way

That you'd be back someday

That make me so in love with you

""Place your bets, it's your last chance!"" 
Then you fold your hand before you play the game 
You never want to sacrifice 

Because to you its all unfair So wear that poker face and try to shrug it off 
If seeing is believing then you might as well be blind 
Because the searching leaves you faithless And the outcome undefined 
But you still wait for something, for someone, to let you down You're losing again 

There's never a question it all goes unnoticed There's nothing to risk or to gain 
You're so used to being used to everything Still, 
You never want to sacrifice Because to you its all unfair 
The more that you hold on the more it slips away Again and again, 

You try to make some sense But it all turns out the same What has changed? 
Then you find that you're just the same as anybody So tell me now, who is left to blame?",Full House,1999
Cooter,"Is this all part of the game you play
Do you try to make me feel this way
You try to sell me something that you don't believe
I guess for you it's easier this way
I never did hear you complain
And I stand aside
Bite my nails while you decide

I wish that I could hate you but I can't
I wish that you would vanish but you're too hard to forget
I can't do if it isn't right
But you're not willing to compromise

I know you think you've got me figured out
You think you know what I'm about
I don't think you'd be surprised
You have to know how hard I've tried
And after all the time we've spent
Would this be something you'd regret
Would you feel the need to stay
Or turn your back and walk away",Bite My Nails,2000
Cooter,"Fed up knocked down
Withheld from everything that once was comfortable
Well so much for routine
You're weighed down, sinking
Swimming against the stream that once carried you home
Took you to the place where you belonged

I thought I heard you crying out
I thought I heard you say goodbye
It doesn't matter where you are, your shadow's right behind

You know your reflection doesn't lie
You see a tired face through sullen, sunken eyes
A portrait of regret
It won't let you forget
Still tangled in the net you thought you'd left behind
Just to find you can't run from yourself

You're wearing down but still the same
Dawn to dusk...day to day
You stagger on, shrouded in shame
Still haunted by shadows; they're calling your name

I thought I heard you reaching out
Grasping just to stay alive
Your shadow just gets longer as the sun falls from the sky",Dawn to Dusk,2000
Cooter,"A desperate breath inhaled, then it leaves you hollowed out
As you struggle to feel something
Abandoned eyes that drowned in the disbelief and doubt
When you woke up Friday morning

You didn't say goodbye
You knew she wasn't gone
You whispered",Friday Morning,2000

It might be the only chance you get
After a life time of regrets
It finally looks like things are looking up so don't look down
Because I don't want to see you falling

You thought you'd have all the answers
Was once right now seems to be all wrong
You're fed up and you give up
You've come too far for far too long
Too much is expected of you

There are things I'd like to change 
I miss the innocence, when the doors all stood wide open

The silence is keeping you awake
Staring outward past your ceiling and pushing thoughts away

There's no resolution when the day is over
When there's so much left undone
There must be something better than this tired cycle
Where there's so much left unsaid

An empty bedroom can be freezing
Every midnight seems so cold
Staring outward past your ceiling

I want to see the change

I'm standing outside

And I tried to be strong

As we went along
And you said nothing changed
So what's left to believe?
I'm not going to leave

There's nothing left to say
Don''t say you were blind
Because I never lied
I'm just hoping now that you will remember me

You know just what you're doing
Because you do it oh so well

I sacrificed my sanity to keep from breaking down
I always thought of you and forgot about myself

I used to be so nave
And you never cared about me
Now I see that I can't achieve
Everything that you want from me

Honesty was all I asked but you just let me down
Countless times I gave you the benefit of the doubt
You think that I'm a fool you'll get away with it
But this time I'm not so willing to forgive and forget

Feeling unappreciated
Dedication understated

Cooter,"As I came to my wits end
It was easier to break than bend
You said I lost my faith, but I think it was taken from me
Never could let my guard down
Once again I start to drown
Because the water that you said to walk on suddenly gave way beneath

Once again you prove yourself
And I'd expect it out of someone else
But its the best laid plans that often run astray
Yeah I know it sounds cliche
But it seems the more things change
The more things stay the same
And that's proved to make me wise
As I look through tired eyes

Don't ask me to walk on water
Meet you on the other side
As you stand there looking blankly past me

I was never good enough
I could never do enough

Cop Shoot Cop,"She had just busted out of the whorehouse
And was looking for a drink to celebrate the divorce
She told 'em she was going out for smokes -- and never looked back
The sky was bloodshot as she stumbled into the bar
Sullen eyes lit up like cigarettes
Cockroaches were gasping for breath
She selects her poison, brings it to her lips
A song like drunken sailors from a sunken ship
She thinks, power comes to them that enjoy the thrill of fear
A sign says: If you're looking for answers, you won't find them here

Everyone is leaving, all the widows grieving
Hear the siren laughing, and the truck brakes groaning
While the subway's screaming, all the junkies dreaming
Now the shadow's falling, is that your lover calling?

She grinds out cigarette in a souvenir ashtray
Reaches for the bottle but ther's nothing left
Says: Buy me a drink and I'll tell you a story
But the bitch at the bar wouldn't sell you a smile
She closes her eyes and thinks of a wish she once had
A dwindling spark of memory
She wants to wipe it clean -- scrape away the debris
Can I get you something? - it's a man in the periphery
The car keys in his hand
She searches her pockets for a match or a reason
He slams the money on the bar
They go out to his car

When you put your hand in your pocket
Looking for a match or something to say
Life seems like a rerun
Everything coming up cliches
Suicide comes on like a friend
Seems like the bad times never end
Close your eyes and think of home

With a widow and a dyke
Dress up as the ex-husband with the widow on the right
To my left is the dyke, 
As I bite on the nipple of her tit, 
Pushed the widow's head to nibble on her clit
Tape it and sell it off the net
For a bitch mad I did it without consent, you're awfully wet
Got hoes suspicious. Even one peg leg bitches
After I came, fucked em with they own leg
They ain't know the difference
Your cunt's wet and your pants are soaked with it
I don't discriminate, even cancer hoes get it
So open up, I'ma cram your throat with it
I want you to suck just like the antedote's in it
All you strong women claimin queen to the universe, 
I'll fill you with Kahlua and cream on your newest skirt

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,

Coral MacFarland Thuet,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Coral Reefer Band,"In the middle of late last night I was sittin' on a curb
I didn't know what about but I was feeling quite disturbed
A street sweeper came whistlin' by
He was bouncin' every step
It seemed strange how good he felt
So I asked him while he swept

He said ""It's my job to be cleaning up this mess
And that's enough reason to go for me
It's my job to be better than the rest
And that makes the day for me""

Got an uncle who owns a bank he's a self made millionaire
He never had anyone to love never had no one to care
He always to seemed kind of sad to me
So I asked him why that was
And he told me it's because in my contract there's a clause
That says ""It's my job to worried half to death
And that's the thing people respect in me
It's a job but without it I'd be less
Than what I expect from me""

I've been lazy most all of my life
Writing songs and sleeping late
Any manual labor I've done purely by mistake
If street sweepers can smile then
I've got no right to feel upset
But sometimes I still forget
Till the lights go on and the stage is set
And the song hits home and you feel that sweat

It's my job to be different than the rest
and that's enough reason to go for me
It's my job to be better than the best
and that's a tough break for me
It's my job to be cleaning up this mess
and that's enough reason to go for me

It's my job to be better than the best
and that makes the day for me",It's My Job,2003

I'd like to be a jellyfish
'Cause jellyfish don't pay rent
They don't walk and they don't talk

They're just simple protoplasm
Clear as cellophane
They ride the winds of fortune

In one ear and out the other
Don't you get criss-crossed
I recommend you try a little
Mental floss 

It's the small, small problems
That keep me so upset
And send me seeking shelter
Beneath my mosquito net 

I stay there for hours
Protected from the night
All those insects and vipers
And other things that bite

Forced rejection long ago.
Too many innocent faces in too many

Riding for just a dime,
Takin' her own sweet and knowing well

To the river, people pass her by.
She sits on the big gray rocks,
Takes off her boots and socks,
Not knowing what she will do next,
Just starts to cry.

Angry questions from her dad.
To many TV dinners, ah, everyone
Loves a winner, but she has lost.
No ones knows the trials she had.

And my love is an anchor tied to you, tied with a silver chain
I have my ship and all her flags are a-flying
She is all I have left and music is her name

Coral Reefer Band,"The ice cream man he's a hillbilly fan,
He's got seventy-eights by Hank Snow,
Walks down the street, shufflin' his feet,
To the rhythm that only he knows.
And I've seen him in so many places,
I saw him the night I was born,
In a Bourbon Street bar I received my first scar
From an old man so tattered and torn. 

And the Wino and I know the pains of street singin'
Like the door-to-door salesman knows 
The pains of bell ringin'
It's a strange situation,
A wild occupation,
Living my life like a song. 

Well the coffee is strong 
At the Cafe do Monde,
And the donuts are too hot to touch,
But just like a fool, when those 
Sweet goodies cool, I ate 'til I ate way too much.
Cause I'm livin' on things that excite me,
Be they pastries or lobsters or love,
I'm just tryin' to get by being quiet and shy,
In a world full of pushin' and shove. 

And the Wino and I know the pains of backbustin',
Like the farmer knows the pain of his pick-up 
Truck rustin'.
It's a strange situation, a wild occupation,
Living my life like a song. 

Sweet Senorita, won't you please come with me?
Back to the island, honey, back to the sea,
Back to the only place that I want to be. 

And the Wino and I know the joys of the ocean,
Like a boy knows the joys of his milkshake
In motion.

Living my life like a song.",The Wino and I Know,2003

This is getting serious
Are you thinking 'bout you or us

Don't say what you're about to say
Look back before you leave my life
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
Baby think twice

Baby think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory
For the fire and the faith that was you and me
Baby I know it ain't easy when your soul cries out for a higher ground
'Coz when you're halfway up, you're always halfway down
But baby this is serious
Are you thinking 'bout you or us

music and lyrics by Corb Lund


The show was a big one, an olde rodeo

They'd been trying to hire us for a few years or so

The grandstand was bursting, the infield was full

They'd run all the chucks and they'd bucked all the bulls


I felt stiff in the saddle, had been a year since I'd rode

And I'd never been on him save an afternoon lope

But this was the last thing on my tortured mind

As I put heels to belly and my band played the time


He was a big sorrel gelding with a golden streaked mane

A silver mounted saddle and hand braided reins

He had one blue eye that was clear like the rain

But the horse I rode in on felt none of my pain


Well we made quite an entrance in show business style

And twelve thousand people all witnessed my smile

But you were not there among them I'm sorry to say

As I rode through the crowd toward the big outdoor stage


If my pony was skittish with all the people around

And if he spooked just a little when the spotlight shone down

It's nothing compared to the heart break and pain

That come with a love that has withered in vain


So we played through the show and like I always do

I sang every one of the love songs for you

Then I climbed right back on him and I spurred him away

And as the cheers and the dust from the arena did fade

I didn?t feel like no cowboy anymore, anyway


",The Horse I Rode in On,2007
Corbett,"Another face, in the crowd
Fall from grace I'm coming down
You're the best thing that I found
You're the best thing that I found
You lost your way
I lost my crown
I'm still here feet on the ground
You're the best thing that I found
You're the best thing that I found (that I found)

I used to get these feelings and think of these crazy things
But when you shine your light on me it's like you gave me wings
I thought I was depressed, you showed me how much more I was blessed
I'm thanking you lord, this I could confess
You know more than anybody all that I had to go through
I heard you when you said that's just somethin' I had to show you
For me to get to know you like I know you
And when the reaper tried to come to get me
You came to save me, I owe you
Some call you Jesus's father, but some say you the holy ghost
I know you love because when things get ugly you hold me close
This is why I try to live the life of 'just righteousness'
Feeling like the opposite something you wouldn't like for us
Coulda easily got addicted, couldn't kick it
You told me to never try it, that's why I never did it
Heavenly father, never forget it
My life without you, I'd just rather not live it

Another face, in the crowd
Fall from grace I'm coming down
You're the best thing that I found
You're the best thing that I found
You lost your way
I lost my crown
I'm still here feet on the ground
You're the best thing that I found
You're the best thing that I found (that I found)

Yeah
Not ashamed of my pain
Not ashamed of my struggle
I lost some battles but I'm still out here facing this trouble
Facing my trials cause they only make me stronger
Starving in these streets will only elevate your hunger
Beat me down and laugh at me, tell me that this is foolishness
They can't take my hope away, from and nobody's movin' it
Faith ain't what you make it, faith is all I got to make it
Tired of you forsaken, you naked left in it vacant
Forget them naysayers and haters and stay at it
Sometimes a dream broken is a dream worth having
My pastor
Can't rewind it and back up
Focus fixed on the future so tell my failures to backup
Get back up after you fall when your back is up on that wall
Ain't no backup that you control, just look back up at god and call
Sometimes the pain is the motivation of trust
And them scars are the evidence that the journey was rough, yeah
None of it was in vain, readjusted the aim
Missed a couple of shots
Still ain't outta the game

Another face, in the crowd
Fall from grace I'm coming down
You're the best thing that I found
You're the best thing that I found

You're the best thing that I found
You're the best thing that I found (that I found)

Don't let me be, just another one
I always told myself, I'll be here when it's done
I know they don't believe, but see we just begun
Momma I'm growin up, you gotta let me run
(Gotta let me run, gotta let me run) Let me run
(Gotta let me run, gotta let me run) Let me run
(Gotta let me run, gotta let me run) Hey
Momma I'm growin up, you gotta let me run

I don't know but I gotta go, gotta go slow, but I gotta go cause I gotta grow
The flow got a nigga fall but I gotta show that I got a lot mo' to go
I gotta blow
I won't take no, I don't think so
Hold on strong and no I won't let go
I'm almost there, I know I won't take long
I look in the rear and it's a long way home
Don't let me be, just another one
Momma I'm growin up, run that to your younger son
I'm the one when it's all said and done
Let it run to get a gun, the one that'll blow one
The one with the cold stare, niggas wanna go there
And oh yeah I don't fear no one
Right now Twista-like style
Quick to pipe down when usually I fight back
Now I'm lookin' like wow
I came to learn that my main concern's gripping the mic down
Wow, album number two, how comfortable, last one was for you
This one is for you and for frontin' niggas too
Comin' for you, now what you gonna do?

[Chorus]

Run away with the moonlight
Third eye too bright for me to lose sight
And I'm only fuckin' with niggas that move right
Can't rock with a man pants too tight
You belong in the blue light district
This prick take ""ho nigga"" to new height
You in the strip club you might
See a nigga throwing bread, no food fight, right
Got a style like Ike
The beat is my bitch, I'm wild for the night
Soup's upside your head when I spit it
Another DV tell the Feds I did it
Get on TV with a Red Sox fitted
Bet I won't go near Bed-Stuy with it
You know I'm just kiddin, Earth is our turf
I'm the person to say that first in my verse
Don't let me be, just another one
Just a statistic when I'm havin so much fun
I'm in the boom-boom room with a poon-poon
Lips smellin like perfume, wanna resume soon
Put your money where your mouth is
Bet you find your honey where my house is

[Chorus]

I don't know what I'm runnin' from
I don't know where I'm runnin' to
Seems your dreams are not comin' true
What the fuck are you gonna do?
Stop it now? How dumb are you?
How many lumps you want, one or two?
Your future's right there in front of you
Whatever you do with it is up to you
Not for nothin' but who the fuck are you?
Lot of other people are fucked up too
You ain't the only one who luck's up, boo
Life's a bitch, but you could fuck her too

Long as you're cool we can be friends
I'm a little bit of this, a little bit of that
Best of both worlds all over the map

I'm just a regular guy
I ain't even gonna lie
I'm trying to figure it out
What this life thing's all about

If you're from the rhythm nation
Let me hear you all say, hey, ya
Join in on the conversation
Put your two cents and say, hey, ya

Mixed up and I think I like it
Feels so different, I'm cool with it

Mixed up and I think I like it
Mixed up and I think I like it
Mixed up and I think I like it
Feels so different, I'm cool with it

Why you gotta place me in a category?
I'm just trying to be me and that's all I can be
It's only half of the story but if you'll read to the end
Maybe then you'll begin to understand me

Everything you do, you do your own way
Letting down your hair, made me stop and stare
Very first time I saw your face

The way you smile, you got style
And it shows you've got it goin' on
How you walk, the way you talk
You gotta know you're everything I want

Never met girl like you, so amazing
Every little thing you do gets me every time
Never met a girl like you, you drive me crazy
You're the only one I think about day and night

Never met a girl like you
The way you

Way you like to play, flirt and run away
Everything you do, so unique
Silly way you dance, don't you hold back
Use your attitude, be who you wanna be

You're the girl, flipped my world
You call me up and leave some crazy message
Eight o' clock, heard you knock
Woke me up, made me wear my PJ's to breakfast

Never met girl like you, so amazing
Every little thing you do gets me every time
Never met a girl like you, you drive me crazy
You're the only one I think about

The way you keep it chill with looks that kill
It's a vibe that's all your own
Way you hear your song and sing along
Silly ring tones on your cell phone

How you like to laugh every chance
And the way you say my name
You're unusual, original
In every single way

Never met a girl like you
Never met a girl like you, no
You drive me crazy
How you walk, the way you talk
You gotta know you're everything I want

Never met girl like you, so amazing
Every little thing you do gets me every time
Never met a girl like you, you drive me crazy

Roll with you
Yeah, roll with you
Roll with you

It's in your eyes just love the way you walk away, knowing that I'm watching you.
Everything about us I can see, it's just the way I thought that it could be.
When you take my hand it's like I never wanna stop the way I feel right now.
You're getting' to me like a fever I can't shake.
Like I'm dreamin' while I'm wide awake.

Lucky, my friends say I'm lucky.
Steepin' in the city with you it's lock down.
Crazy, I must be crazy.
'cause it feels crazy good.

When I roll with you in the night, music ragin', floor is shakin'
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.
Wanna roll with you by my side, beats bangin', sensation.
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.

Took a little time for me to find a way for me to really be myself.
Always hangin' out and runnin' with the crowd
Then you dropped the bomb, gave me something that nobody ever did before.
Kinda like this groove it just feels right, kinda like the stars light up the night.

Lucky, my friends say I'm lucky.
Steepin' in the city with you it's lock down.
Crazy, I must be crazy.
'cause it feels crazy good.

When I roll with you in the night, music ragin', floor is shakin'
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.
Wanna roll with you by my side, beats bangin', sensation.
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.

Nothin' better baby, but you and me in the glow, you feel the same way, and I like it When you
Let me know let me know.
Special somethin', I don't know what it is, but I count my blessings that you're right here with me.

I wanna roll with you in the night, music ragin', floor is shakin'.
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.
Wanna roll with you by my side, beats bangin', sensation.
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.

Just wanna roll with you in the night.
Roll with you.
Music bangin', floor is shakin'.
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.
Wanna roll with you by my side, beats bangin', sensation.
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.

Been playing football with the guys
She's all high fives
And dirty footprints on the floor

She's hanging out
She's got her dress and high heels on
And we're alone, I couldn't ask for nothing more

And I love

A simple smiles reveals it all
She calls my name

She could be just the one I've waited for
Could be a perfect score and more

It's Friday night
And her friends are home by nine
We hit the show, tip the bouncer, skip the line
Next thing I know, we're out the door
And now she's dancing in the rain, a fragile flame
Under the pale blue colored light

And I don't know if I'd be here if not for you
I had to take a little time to try to work things out
And you should know that I had never meant to let you down

'Cause I, I wanna tell you
That I'm sorry and I, I

Even when I'm not giving enough and I'm taking too much
You're still there for me
Even when I got nothing at all and I'm ready to fall
You're still there for me, there for me, there for me

Even when I can't be there for you
You're always there for me

Sometimes I know I can be so hard to understand, it is okay
Even when I'm lost you show me who I really am
Life with me hasn't always been an easy ride
But because of you I've learned to lose my selfish pride

'Cause I, I wanna tell you
That I'm sorry and I, I

You're still there for me
Even when I got nothing at all and I'm ready to fall

Even when I can't be there for you

Oh, no, it's love, ooh

It's the little things that make us smile
That, that, that, that make us smile

Like the very first time that you discovered true love
It's a feeling you can't describe
But it always stays on your mind

Or the first time you hear your song on the radio
That gives you goose bumps all over from head to toe
All the time you stayed up all night on the phone
And you look down and realize she's staring
At the same song as your boo

That's what gets me sentimental
That's what life is all about
That's what gets me all emotional
More than all the things I can do without

'Cause I figured out
These are the moments that matter, matter
And I figured out
That these are the moments that mean the most to me

'Cause I know I've got friends, trust, family and love
All around me that should be enough
And I figured out
These are the moments that matter, matter to me

The one thing that I try cherish when I'm on the road
Is I know I'm never alone
N-n-never alone

Just look around at sunsets and waterfalls
And you know that God's very close
'Cause the world's full of miracles

It's like that the first time that I learned my history
'Cause my dad looked down into my eyes
And broke it down for me

I still remember my mother asking me how my day went
When I came home from school
And these are some sweet memories

'Cause that's what gets me sentimental
That's what life is all about
That's what gets me all emotional

That these are the moments that mean the most to me

'Cause I know I've got friends, trust, family and love

'Cause when it gets tough they'll help you pull through
No don't let anybody take your moment from you

Corbin/Hanner,"Just the other night a hometown football game
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me
Inn her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days
There wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all

And as she walked away and I looked at my wife
And then and there I thankedd the good Lord
For the gifts in my life

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered...
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers",Just Another Hill,2013
Corby Yates,"Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday,
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she's gonna come back tomorrow

And I said ""fly on my sweet angel,
Fly on through the sky,
Fly on my sweet angel,
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side""

Sure enough this morning came on to me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel she said on to
""Today is the day for you to rise,
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man,
You're gonna rise""
And she took me high over yonder

And I said ""fly on my sweet angel,
Fly on through the sky,
Fly on my sweet angel,
Forever I will be by your side""",Angel,2003

Prête-moi ton regard 
ou quelques pas de danse
quelques espoirs quelquefois
s'écartent, se jouent et s'oublient
en quelque part
or prête-moi ton regard

J'me suis trompé encore
une fois de plus une fois de trop
t'as raison et j'ai tort
j'me suis trompé encore
alors qu'est-ce qu'on fait
on s'accuse, on s'ignore?
oh non! prête-moi ton regard

Tiger! Tiger! burning bright
in the forest of the night*
si je savais c'qui nous sépare
Tiger! Tiger! burning bright
in the forest of the night
j'me suis trompé encore

Prête-moi ta plume, griffonne-moi
griffonne-moi de mots gras
de beaux barbots
ou de barbots bêtes
mais griffonne-moi

Et je tombe encore
sans mise en scène
sans remords et sans regret
je tombe encore
je m'abandonne
je me défais de moi
si tu me prêtes ton regard

Malgré les revers
malgré la peur
malgré les rêves ébréchés
je te poursuis
te poursuivrai
au bout du compte
sans garde-fou
je pourrai me laisser glisser
et je pourrai brûler

in the forest of the night

Another year over, a new one just begun.

O ye'll tak' the high road and I'll tak' the low road,
And I'll be in Scotland afore ye.
But me and my true love will never meet again,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomond.

‘Twas there that we parted in yon shady glen, 
On the steep, steep side o' Ben Lomond. 
Where in deep purple hue, the hieland hills we view, 
And the moon comin' out in the gloamin'.

The wee birdies sing and the wild flowers spring,
And in sunshine the waters are sleeping:
But the broken heart, it kens nae second spring again,
Tho' the waefu' may cease from their greeting.

Cordelia's Dad,"I was out one night
acrawling and acreeping.
I spied a fair maiden
asnoring and asleeping.
Just lay your leg over me, do.
Says I, ""My pretty monarch,
I'll come to bed to you.""
She snored, and replied,
""Just come to bed to me,
and lay your leg over me do.""
""Your drawers are so tight
that I can not undo them.""
She snored, and replied,
""Then take a knife to them.
Just lay your leg over me, do.""
""I haven't owned a knife
since I can remember.""
She snored, and replied,
""There's a knife in the window.
Just lay your leg over me, do.""
The knife was got down
and the drawers was cut under,
and then they went at it
like alightning and athunder
and alay your leg over me, do.
In about nine months,
this maid fell aweeping,
and then she remembered
the snoring and the creeping
and the ""Lay your leg over me, do.""
The babe it was born.
It was an awful wonder
that it wasn't killed
by the lightning and the thunder
and the ""Lay your leg over me, do.""

Preacher lights up a butt and he takes a drag

You got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand

Had ever felt this way inside
And I knew that it was real
It was the first time the first time
Just like the snow fall coming down in June
Impossible but it could be true and
I knew that it was real it was the first time

Man you should of seen us holding hands
Telling our jokes and making plans
Knowing it our hearts it was the start of our ever after
It was then I knew there could never be
Anyone for her but me
And deep down in her heart she knew it too
I'm telling you

It was first time in my life that I
Had ever felt this way inside
And I knew that it was real
It was the first time the first time
Just like the snow fall coming down in June
Impossible but it could be true
And I knew that it was real
It was the first time

Then one day we got the news
Her and her family had to move
There wasn't anything we could do
Then I turned and watched her walk away
All my sunshine turned to rain
I don't want to feel that way again

It was first time in my life that I
Had ever hurt so much inside
And I knew that it was real
It was the first time the first time
Just like the snow fall coming down in June
Impossible but it could be true
And I knew that it was real
It was the first time

It was first time in my life that I
Had ever felt this way inside
And I knew that it was real
It was the first time the first time",First Time [Snippet],2001

You don't wait for me at the bus stop no more 
Don't even bring extra chips in lunch for your boy 
With that stead should as I, I am failing with out you girl.

And notice how each women just freeze when they see me

Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed

The faggot took the back way
So instead of makin hoes suck my dick up

Said you would save me than I looked at you 
And laughed in your face
Said you would heal me and than I turned away 
And treated you like you were fake
In spite of me not being worthy
You still giving new mercy's
Day after day
And chance after chance
You never throw me away

Can put you underground

Taking and abusing the trust
Ruthless and morally bankrupt

And no dough? I don't f*** 'em

F*** I'mma fake for?
Make mine's, I'mma take yours

So tight fold crease right on the president's nose

Touch toed, hoes take a centerfold pose
Break a treat, make 'em pay to enter those 
Pros, slam those

Game tied tight like bows, we never close
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four
Hand chose bithces a la mode, gettin' sold
Plus a load of killer, as Chronic gettin' blowed

Keep it froze, tucked up in a Tupperware bowl
Stick of gold, somethin' from the school of the old
Forever flows, I take it down as deep as it can go
Burn rolls, braids tight, blazed afros

Up in the morning in the court, it's 'bout to go down

I represent it to the end, the same s***

All you see is your boys and reeboks

A thin hat to the back with a strap too
Willin' to bust a n**** a** if he had to
If you feel the same my n*****, you's a hot boy
Blocka, blocka, blocka

Better get up off the block, boy

Across the plains of Texas from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston and New York to L.A.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance

There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;

Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know
We're just holding on to ""could have been""s and we should be letting go

It feels like you're a million miles away as you're lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part but we're just pretending and I can't hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away, away

Was it me, or was it you that broke away?
For what we were is like the season's love is change
And every time I think about it, it tears me up inside
Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry

It feels like you're a million miles away as you're lying here with me tonight

'Cause even though you're here
Feels like you're a million miles away, away

We can try to talk it over but we walked that road before
While our song is playing its last note
We both know for sure that it's time to close that door

But we don't crap out when the dice is rolled, I mean no life, low life
Say my name and hopes to get more life, nigga live yo life
Lame ass nigga, you cookin' with no spice
Lil B sacrifice, show me what your ho like
Hit her with that dope dick, now she's a dope fiend
Leo lion and king, I'm lookin' for a dope queen
Uh, first thing baby, I'm ready to rock
Baby car goes high, man smash flocks
Me does, Millz, Tyga, we give 'em the chills (Millz-y)
Keep riders, get birth control pills

Uh, young money, bright lights
Lord knows I live for these nights
You're damn right, I'mma sip champagne 'till it burn my sight
Yanks fitted cap to the front, like Jeter
My diamonds ain't fierce like an episode of cheetahs, jesus
Mouth jewelry, loud speakers
Blowin' loud weed with some loud divas

A million lights and a kick drum, the floor is moving slow
I've got a feeling 'bout this one, and we still young, you know
I'm breathin' fire in your cup
It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold
It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold

Uh, it's that summertime, money time
Gonna rhyme good time, when a dime gimme mine
Brown smoke, quiet engine out the silly lines
Pretty toes hangin' out the window to the finish line
Spikes pokin' out my kicks like a porcupine
Young Money, Cash Money, We The Best, fall in line
Uptown thoroughbreaded from the south Bronx
How blocks in Miami, Khaled outcome
You made us, they hate us, just to say the latest
Life nothin' like a movie, I just date a ?
Remember it was hard trying to page wagers
Nice spittin' hard rhymes on the main stages
Independent, yeah I told 'em major later
We some independent niggas gettin' major paper
Shout to 'em, Stunna, Slim, Mack
We play for keep, so how we gon' give up that?
YMCMB, lights, camera, action!

A million lights and a kick drum, the floor is moving slow
I've got a feeling 'bout this one, and we still young, you know
I'm breathin' fire in your cup
It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold
It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold",A Million Lights,2011
Corey Gunz,"[Chorus]
It feel like the same old story, everywhere that I go
And I don't really wanna do it all again tomorrow
So I'm trying to find something brand new
I'm sorry if you see me and I'm acting brand new
It feel like the same old bitches, same old haters
See me in the club, wanna come sit at my table
I'm trying to find something brand new
I'm sorry if you see me and I'm acting brand new

No handouts for no niggas
No handouts for no bitches
Killed the underground with my lifestyle
I'll let y'all fucks be the witness
But I'm losing my mind
On the block like 9 and a 9
Well until it got pined
You ain't know that it's something about time?
We didn't care about that
Remember the time I said I rapped?
Then the niggas came after
Even the hoes was full of laughter
Flew back to the booth, went harder
Now node your heads to the product
Suck a nigga dick like he hotter
Slinky on the booty like your father

Beard look like Osama
Don't talk to me less about commas
Real shit, Go time get a meal tip
Save your compliments for the comments
Getting money is my assignment
Will still be in the set

[Chorus]

Damn, these niggas hating, I can't understand
I'm your favourite's favourite, you the fan of a fan
I feel like if I fall off this boat I could walk
Y'all rap, Cory Gunz talk what he talk
Shorty said she coming, she bringing a friend
They ain't smoking with me, though, cause they didn't put in
Bitch, I be touring with Tunechi and Mack
Saluting Stunna on the way to the stage and way back
How many niggas you know chill on the block with they fam and
Tell you if you need something handled, go and holla at Nick Cannon
Still spitting like I'm trying to get the deal
Don't fly private all the time, but I fly private with Shaquille

[Chorus]

Same old haters, niggas just don't give a fuck
Tired of that old shit, swag is on some Bentley truck
Tired of these zeroes, ain't nobody near, though
Cause ain't nobody ready, throw the paper like confetti
Man, I get jobs, a hundred stack
Ya'll miss Jobs, like Wozniak
I make y'all insomniac?
No more sleeping, nigga
What you thinking, nigga?
I got your girl and need that E like we the Weeknd, nigga
People figure, cause I don't like it unless it's brand new
Everything is old news, even all your club clothes
Look like shit I wear when I need something from the Whole Foods
Royalty the newest niggas fucking old dudes

Since this is a stupid beat
Grab the owl out the tree
And ask that bitch, who but me?
Got ya bitch bent over nigga, hands to her feet
Tell that pig and that cow I'll go ham if it's beef
'Cause all my niggas well rounded
Don't fuck with none of these square niggas

But I got my Cochran
Losing ain't no option

Hustle in the morning, smokin' in the clouds
Bitches come in dumpin' 'cause they ran a hundred miles
Rain still pourin', the bottles lift up
Stuntin' on them bitches and the whips flamed up
The sun do shine, Christmas every day
Them holidays comin', so you know we quick to spray
Muscle is a must, the money in the can
Strapped every day, we still hustle in the sand

I'mma need a mountain of money
An amount that amounts to a mountain of money
Ride out with my dunny, fresh up out your mommy
Shout to the tummy - eat, sleep, shit on my toes
Bust a bitch in her nose cause they mouth so runny
Back to the money, Dada
Give a nigga bread like ""bless you"" (thank you) nada
I'm been on the block from the top tryna plot on a spot
Now I'm game with it - ta da!
Fuck around, I'll bang with the sawed-off
Fuck around, rob these niggas, do my thing like ""voila""
Ain't nothin' changed but the dollars
Niggas so lame 'cause they ain't gon' claim I'm they father
I'm one of the niggas that don't fold
Treat me like one of them niggas that don't rap
Spinning 'em like a Tommy, automatic my laddy
I've been known to get niggas in one ""blap!""

Every single morning that a nigga get out of bed
Kknow a nigga gotta get it
Money to burn, raw OG kush in a $100 bill, smoke weed with it
Why y'all niggas wanna whip shit with it?
Musson, I ain't gotta put a key in it
True don, make me wanna whip in it
Different money - add another didget
Get this money then I slide and I'm gone
Y'all already know who's side that I'm on
YMCMB my nigga - Rich Gang, everything far from the norm
From the jails to the college campus, we've got 'em yellin' in the dorms
We try to compete 'til they go bankrupt, and we're just gettin' warm
If you ain't know, motherfucker, you can take another look, nigga
Whole team strong
And we knock every spot on the charts
Every time a nigga drop each song
I don't need to tell 'em, they already know what it is
We run every city and we runnin' every block, nigga
Respect this conglomerate, bitch, 'cause you can't reach the #1 spot

I ain't do much time, but dawg I ain't going back
These niggas fake and they phony, the paparazzi wait on me
I left the jail in Givenchies, they should have posted that homie
I'm in the A with Rich Homie, I'm in the A with 2 Chainz
I'm in the A with my brother, it's YMCM Rich Gang
Now tell them niggas line up, I tell them niggas time up
This KTZ gon' stand out, it's clear I don't give a fuck
In my closet I eat you up, my fashion ill, no duh
My whip game insane uh Ferrari Testarossa's
Y'all niggas thought I lost it, I'm awesome
I just took a break to teach a young nigga how to boss it
Like when KG went to Boston
Or when Melo went to the Knicks
And he brought JR Smith and they both started ballin'
Big bro went from serving birds to pelicans in New Orleans
Uh, let me take a break,
Let me catch my breath
Rolling with the Birdman homie
It's YM over everything, nigga, I don't need nothing else

Check (shoot'er) Sometimes I think I'm Michael Jordan
Michael Tyson, Michael Phelps and Michael Jackson
Might just drop my fucking tape and fuck around, it might go platinum
How'd I do that off of freebies? Fill my double cup with ether
Got the same buzz as niggas with an album off of features
See I'm doing it again
Got a tool in the timbs, now the rules gotta bend
No tools in the gym but I gotta bring it in
'Cause niggas wanna flex, but they really slim Jim
Gotta point it at him, him, fuck it and him
All I wanna do is kill kill for the ching ching
Got a best friend and the best friend got a twin
Gotta fit 'em all in, now that's a win win win win
The room's spinning 'cause I'm faded
Watch how you run up on these businessmen, they're gang related
I said I like the way she dance, she like the way I made it
Fuck me without paying a rent, imagine if I paid it
I owe you one girl, I owe you one's
Money always been the main attraction
Homie told me women always been the main distraction
And I'm too focused, I just hate to get disturbed
I'm busy making millions, she just started laughing so you know I had to

To the face of a fuck nigga trying to fuck with us
Think they can make it if they can run a decathlon
Stay blazing, I mack on,
Play brave and get back home with them AK's
Crack arms with a straight face
That calm and I fain gaze
And attack on with a straight razor in that palm
Any nigga want it he gotta get it
The Yappa got it rolling and rocking with it
I got a nigga showing and popping, picking and going
Packing a fight, everybody hit the floor, he shot the men and boom
Pall bearers, cold moms, militia all Bishop's, O-Dawg's
You should've drove off, hitting on bitches and poor dogs
Looking the nose off, looking like I'm flicking the stove off
When I'm kicking the stove off, kicking the doors off
Everybody hit the deck, still bodies get thrown off
Say making a remarkable pay
Meeting grandpa at a doc or a bay
Bad bitch, hide the grippers, I may
Fucking killing unbook, come the coppers and spray
Twizzie get the chicken, they plot him hopping the gate
If you get to trippin' then you get shot in the face
You ain't got the bitch in the kitchen popping the safe

Corey Harris,"Just a closer walk with Thee,
Grant it, Jah, is my plea,
Daily walking close to Thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

I am weak, but Thou art strong;
Jesus, keep me from all wrong;
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk, let me walk close to Thee.

Through this world of toil and snares,
If I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who with me my burden shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee.

When my feeble life is o'er,
Time for me will be no more;
Guide me gently, safely o'er
To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy shore.

So I want you start movin', start and I want you to say

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Hear what your brother say, ain't got to contemplate
Fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way
Time is the master, time can be a disaster
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Drop it, drop it, moving on the down
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Ain't no time to play

Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
Ain't no time to play
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run (got no-one to blame but yourself) you missed the starting gun

A tick-a-tick-a-tock, look-a at the clock
Got to move it on the dot, and don't you know because the time is
The time, the time, the time, the time is the master
And time can be a disaster, yeah you know
Got no time to play
The time is the master, huh
And time is the master, yeah
I say you can't change the hands of time
And you could never turn back hands of time
Got no time to play
Got to get on the go and got to move it, right away when I tell you, say we got no time to be late
When I tell you, say whaa
'Cause time is the master
A tick-a-tick-a-tock-a move it on the dot and don't you look back till you could die
See the time, it's a terrible time
'Cause homie say can me say see what's time, yo
Yeah, you know?
Got to know what you understand, is what I want you to say, ain't got no time for me, got no time for delay is what I want you to say
A tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tock, move it on and say a-you could never stop

Move it right away, I never tell you, don't wanna say 'cause this-a time is the master

When I tell you understand what I leave behind, leave for man, suppose I wanna go, she want you to say whaa!

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire

Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell",Time,2003

Where's the ""Catcher in the Rye"" anyway
O the tragedy
Young rebels in their glory - misunderstood
Such a calamity
It's obvious the babes do steal the wood
Another angry young man they say
So sad that he lost his way
Another angry young man they say
O the youth how they drift away
I, I tell you now the summer's high
The forward cast of windswept dreams in the air
I will run close to the edge - every time
Between the wedge there lies a passion that's born
I said a passion that's born - born
O the tragedy
Of unsung heroes searching for their cause
Such a calamity
The unrequited rebel without applause
Another angry young man they say
So sad that he lost his way

And can you count the ways you ask yourself why
You carry on, yea, yea, yea

But when you look around and find you're alone
Tell me where can you turn to

Our love is a burden we both bear 
These vows are the chains we hide 

I don't know where it all went wrong 
What happened to our happy home 

What happened to forever 
What happened to for worse or better 
What happened to our plans 
What happened to the ring on her hand 
What happened to our love 
What happened, oh, to us 

This past month's been hell 
With gnashing teeth and brimstone fire 
Furious flames have filled the rooms 
Of this little house of ours 
We've said a lot of things 
That cut eachother to the core 
She said ""you're no good 
Just like your daddy, that don't love you anymore"" 
And now I'm drinking way too much 
But these days, it's all that gets me through 
And sometimes I feel like this whiskey bottle 
Is the one I'm married to 

Oh and we've been going to church 
Still it feels like things keep getting worse 
Lord help us 

What happened to forever 
What happened to for worse or better 
What happened to our plans 
What happened to the ring on her hand 
What happened to our love 
What happened, oh, to us 

She came home late last night 
With tear-stained rings around her eyes 
And she said ""this isn't how it's supposed to be"" 
Then she cried ""what happened to you and me?"" 

What happened to surprises 
What happened to the compromises 
What happened to the romance 
What happened to holding my hand 
What happened to our love 
What happened, oh, to us 

What happened to forever 
What happened to for worse or better 
What happened to our plans 
What happened to the ring on your hand 
What happened, what happened, what happened... 
What happened to us...

Corey Smith,"Feels like a Friday night
But it's only Monday afternoon
Still there's a party goin' on in my livin' room
It's just me and fifth of Beam
Swayin' to the sounds of old George Jones
And it won't be long 'til the whole damn bottle's gone

And I know it might sound sad
But to tell the truth it ain't half bad
I love my misery
Gonna drown my blues in a sea of whiskey

I'm drinkin' again
Tryin' hard to hide the pain I'm in
So don't give me any shit, I know just what I'm gettin' in
Sure, it's a sin but I don't really give a damn
I'm drinkin' again

I've got no friends to call
They've all straightened up and settled down
And they don't ever wanna hang around
But I guess I understand
This house ain't much for company
Smells like a cesspool here
It's stinkin' nasty

And you might say I'm bad off
But I chose the road I strumbled across
I picked my poison
Give me another shot of bourbon

Cause I'm drinkin' again
Tryin' hard to hide the pain I'm in
So don't give me any shit, I know just what I'm gettin in
Sure, it's a sin but I don't really give a damn
I'm drinkin' again

Well fortunately for me I find relief
When the world is weighin' down on me
I pop a top, I take a shot, I drop a pill
Turn the radio up, sit back and chill
Pretend my life is a bed of roses
Try not to notice all the ghosts
That are hauntin me and tauntin me
And wantin me to cut my wrists
So they can watch me bleed
And laugh at me, as I scream in agony
I get high for the sake of my family
Cause the alcohol is all that's helpin me
To cope since I went broke and lost my hope
I kicked my girl to the curb of the road
You know I couldn't afford to support us both
Hell I'm not rich, don't have a good job
Do construction work with this dude named Bob
And he's an ass. Yells at me all the time
Pays minimum wage on overtime
Still he's got it made, drives an Escalade
And gets two hundred times what I get paid
But that's okay.
I'll drink to his health and ruin mine
I'll chug liquor and he can sip red wine
And I'll be fine. Trying to find some peace
I'll quit payin' my rent and I'll break my lease
I'll live out on the streets and beg for change
Crawl in a box when it starts to rain
Forget my family and my friends
Forget the world, ya'll, I'm drinkin' again

I'm drinkin' again
Tryin' hard to hide the pain I'm in
So don't give me any shit, I know just what I'm gettin in
Sure, it's a sin, but I done lost control
And I'm drinkin' again y'all
I'm drinkin' again

I'm drinkin' again...

Its time to show myself the door

Another jailbird like everyone in the family

Cause they're the ones who understand the situation that I'm in
They feel my pain and man I'm gonna miss em when I'm gone
But I'm moving on, If I don't I'll be dead by 21
I'd shoot myself in the head before I wind up like my dad
Working a job I hate and taking out my anger on a kid
I can hear my mama crying as I cross that county line
Cause she knows I'm not looking back I'm leaving all this shit behind

Me and you in a midnight blue, ?82 Camaro

Crossin? over the Hartwell bridge movin? fast as she would go

Windows down, radio up, we were singin? ?Freebird?

Flyin? up to your daddy?s cabin just outside of Spartanburg


Do you remember the way you looked at me back then

Two hungry eyes wrapped up in a smile so innocent

It all makes one hell of a reminder

Keeps me cryin? Carolina


We had a hotel room with a harbor view and a bottle of Chianti

That spring break in Charleston, it keeps comin? back to haunt me

Took a carriage ride to the battery, toasted shots above the water

Then stumbled ?cross the cobblestone, hands holdin? us together


Do you remember the way we carried on

Blew all our money and we had to starve the whole way home

It all makes one hell of a reminder

Keeps me cryin? Carolina


I can?t let it go, no I can?t let it go

I don?t wanna? let go, oh no it feels too far away

When I?d ride up to Clemson and hide in your room the whole weekend

And when her daddy's not around, she don?t act like a preacher's child

And I knew what she was after when asked me for the ride

A baseball cap and a fake I'd would get me in the clubs
Then I would dance with the college girls and lie about who I was
Well, I'm premed here at UGA
Live on Millage Avenue
I was raised over in Buckhead
I drive a BMW
I was breaking hearts
And taking names and numbers just for fun
Stealing kisses wishing I was twenty one

Well Thursdays came
And pocket change would quickly disappear
Upstairs at Lowry's Tavern
We'd pay a nickel for the beer
Shooting pool, smoking cigarettes
With a dizzy head and a grin
4 A.M. on a school night
Still hanging out with my friends
One hour sleep on a dirty coach
No shower off to school
Smelling just like a brewery
With a bad hangover too
The teachers all would hassle me
""Stay awake Pay Attention""
I was catching hell wishing I was twenty one

The youngest one of all my friends
I didn't act my age
Too cool for the football games and the homecoming parades
Now I look back and have to smile
Cause boy it was fun
Being seventeen wishing I was twenty one

Now I'm only twenty six
Feeling more like forty three
My hair lines disappearing
And I never get IDed
My clothes are out of fashion
No I'm not cool anymore
In the bed by ten o clock each night
And up at half past four
Still I go down
To that college town
When the Bulldogs play at home

Corey Taylor,"(Hello, mirror, so glad to see you, my friend, it's been a while)

Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage run through my head
Patterns of my live have thawed and torn me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament
Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me
A bitter fear at the thought of my amends
Hoping that the step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this un-swept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development
We will be amazed before we are halfway through.
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.
We will comprehend the word serenity, and we will know peace
No matter how far down the scale we have gone.
We will see how our experience can benefit others.
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.
We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.
Self-seeking will slip away.
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.
Fear of people and economic insecurity will leave us.
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.
Are these extravagant promises? We think not.
They have been fulfilled amongst others
Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.
We will always be true to our principles.

I'm sliding outside of these high beams and I won't dare
Try to mend this tear, I love I'm fading
The good once there is just dying
So I'm withering away and I'ma trigger when I spray
And I'm attacking everybody till the feeling's gone!

All my life I loved with people, so passive back then
I thought I'd be above this evil, my tolerance level
Then was up with doves and eagles
Currently I've hit ground zero under bugs and beetles
I'm tilted, inside my head's a lettuce but wilted
Serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine I spilt it
Could it be how many times I've been ran over and jilted?
That makes me wanna totally detach from light and just kill shit

I'll know when the pain is gone
It's just a matter of time before my bosses win
And I can feel the wrong
Coming up through the cracks of my heart again
I'm holding on, I'm going
Straight into the mouths of makers
Everything that keeps me calm was taken
I'm letting go, I'm burning through, reserves are low
Just pushing on these old restraints
My time is up cause it's too late

I'm about to blow up on anyone in my way
My anger's set to show up, at any time today
I'm about to blow up on anyone in my way
My anger's set to show up, at any time today

I am lookin' for some fire, yeah, putting on my gang attire
Drooling and blood I can taste, so get the fuck outta my face
I'm a killer with a quick switch, yeah, all I ever really wanted was bliss
Look at me wither to waste, so get the fuck outta my face
Find another one to get bent, yeah, and it ain't no stoppin' this
Lovin' the thrill of the chase, so get the fuck outta my face

It doesn't matter the race, just get the fuck out my face

Going, withering away
Going, withering away
Going, withering away

I gotta say, when my mother died, I really did inside
And that's the other thing that did it
Turning my crazy on a hundred babies gonna plummet
Maybe I should be committed

What am I supposed to do?
Do I just keep faking? Fucking forsaking everything I am?
Another pissed mother fucker with a fist and a plan
Oh but you're making me do this
I can scream while you stand there clueless
If you're listening I've made up my mind
Take another step and I'll snap this time!

Something please save me, I'm losing myself

I don't think I wanna stop it, but the feeling inside is nauseous
I get really exhausted off it, gotta find a way to wash it lock it
Profit nada so I got to drop it, ain't nobody in the cockpit
Toss this lostness, people from the office boxes
If you cross this boss live cautious
Don't make me, don't make me repeat myself
For your safety, because a pilly is beneath my belt
But I don't wanna do anything bad to anybody
But I'll never be perfect
So I'mma say to the people that got a little evil
comin' at you from me I think they deserve it

Straight, literally snappin' out

Watching me wither, how can I give her
Blood when I been so tainted by these bitches

We are the arsenal
Chemically imbalanced, completely disposable
So butter my knuckles and taste it
Another sick delinquent is wasted
I don't forgive, I don't forget
I haven't got time to regret
Everybody else in the world can hate me
Nobody but me can save me!

Shit, Yates, hates, this, place

I wrote songs for the people
Verses that'll make Nixon resign
You can do the same thing with rhymes
""I swear Ghost is doobie, just imagine""
Check out what I started
Who's the first to rock 'fros with out a part in it?
Featherhats partin it, Gladys was the baddest, she wore a six
Pretty-ass foot with an arch in it
Big cars, slammin eight-tracks, slammin' hats
King died in sixty-five, Motown cried
Saw a tear drop from Stevie's eyes
Fogged out glasses
The plan was to bring together all the masses

Yo we put together like CREAM
Matter of fact like a Jamaican team
Sprangler status, hatin' like Mitch Green
Off the wall auctions that dumb out
(We organize extortions)
Burn niggas' labels down, frostin' 'em

We put together like CREAM

Burn niggas' labels down, frostin' 'em

Money Mohammed Ali niggas who keep clean sneakers on
Beef and take niggas eats, streets brought all my features
Terry cloth bed rallies, imagine only seventeen wildin'
Who spent thousand on 'em Ballies?
Denali's now lampin', just stylin' out in Cali
Actin like raw is the mission, mission is to slap 'em
Bankjars, movin in psalms, manipulatin my accountant
Relaxin like, blacks get jobs
Slangin in bangles y'all, chillin from all angles
Don rock more thank you's, gettin my shit washed
Elevator music, Rolex doors with thirty-seven whores
Countin my paper, takin y'all to walls

Corina,"There was a time when things were so right 
Now it seems that everything is wrong 
And how I'd love to change it in one night 
But down inside I know that love is wrong 
The pain I felt, has hurt more than my heart 
The things you've done, I just can't forgive 
I was young, you took me from the start 
But now I've grown and I just want to leave 

Give me back my heart 
'Cause you don't really love me 
Let me be alone 
'Cause I know you don't care 
Please don't try to say 
That I don't understand you 
I know what is mine 
And I don't care to share 

You must have thought that I was young and blind 
I was young, but I could plainly see 
I never thought, a broken heart I'd find 
But when I did, the heart belonged to me 
The way I feel, I know would never end 
How many times has this gone on before 
You told me once, you'd always be my friend 
And now I know what's fair in love and war 

And I don't care to share 
Oh no, no, I don't care to share 
Give me back my heart 
Because that heart belongs to me 
I know you don't care 
No, you never cared 
Give me back my heart 
Give me back my heart 

I know it hurts to have to say goodbye 
To survive is something I must do 
My broken heart, you left it here to die 
I hope in time the pain will come to you 
The love I had, I had for only one 
But, you in turn, loved many more than me 
I can't believe the things that you have done 
And now my love its time to set me free

So many lonely days, turned into longer nights 
I'm standing in the darkness trying to decide who was right 

Out of control, you walked out on me 
My dreams were shattered baby can't you see 
Out of control, I know I was wrong 
Your the one that I loved, I've loved you all along 

My mind tells me to leave you, but then my heart tells me to stay 
My heart tells me to call you but then my mind says not today 
Ask you to return to where you belong, together we'll learn right from wrong 
Run back to me, or then I'm coming after you 
Just give me one more chance to prove my love can be true 

Through the years I showed I loved you so 
The question lingers, why did you let me go 
And though in time my pain will heal 
Nothing will change the way I feel

A type of loan with no dividends

From tonight I know that you're the only one
I've been confused and in the dark

I don't argue like this

I wonder why it is

Melting outside my window
Everything was new

I had noticed a bird and seen
Cherry blossom was falling like confetti
What is happening to me these days?

I, I got intuition, oh I, I had my suspicions
I'm in love with you
It feels like springtime

Emeraldine, apple seed, olive green intense
Colors unfurl like petals in a time lapse sequence
Feels like something in embryo
My heart melts like two inches of snow in April's glow

Could I say I'm dreaming?
Do I change my ways?

We feasted on olives from the fridge
We stood alone and we ate
We made love all afternoon
'Til the stars went gloom

You wrote, I laid, we dine, on oysters and champagne
That's what it seemed like
We connect in so many ways
So easy on my sake

Why am I so shy around you?
Why am I so shy?
Why do I take care to astound you?
Why do I even try?

Another rainy day,
We sat inside by the radiator watchin' old black & white films
Where everybody sang
You played in my solitude
You didn't get dressed 'til 2

New rain, says I, I wrote this song on my guitar
But it didn't turn out right
So we just connected in other ways
So easy on my sake

Why am I so shy around you?
Why am I so shy?
Why do I take care to astound you?

Oh why am I so shy?

Neighbor's always smiling with the baby on her knee
Mia's sat on the front step getting her hair combed out in weaves
And music, the bass boomin', oh, it's from the car parked in the street

Used to spend our summer having parties on the drive
Plastic cups for rum and punch, eating chicken that's hot and sweet

And I'm just sitting, watching, hoping the boys will call for me

Lately I've been driven.

Its a parlor game where you're giving chase.
Guess it could be called an acquired taste.

Corinne Bailey Rae,"Oh Father,
I wish I had understanding.
Never known more
Never been so well informed
We know the score
Heard it all before,
But I've never felt more powerless

There's so much blood on the streets
So much hope refused
So much grainy teenage photographs on the evening news

Oo, when every where's violence
Silently I go

Love's on its way
I hope it won't be too late

When the day comes
And I've counted all my sins
How meant I'll see
I want to be able to say that I did more, more than pray
I did more
Than just spend my money
Just writing letters
Than just going out marching
I did more than talking and saying the right thing
Wearing the right thing
It's time for an uprising

Corinne Bailey Rae,"Breakfast at Mickey's, make-up still on
Elbows on the greasy table cloth
One more coffee and one last cigarette

Smiling at the rain cause you hold me close
My best dress on underneath this old coat
Walking down Blecker no one is awake yet

Still, seven hours
Nothing but clouds
It's enough to make your heart sigh
We should try
So pick me up and take me out

Ooh we crash into love-filled nights
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
Ooh we race till we're out of time
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
And now that you've taken me up so high
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

I could see the lights from the restaurant
I couldn't quite perfect that nonchalance
Paris and champagne with one brown sugar cube

And we danced while the band played Ã¢??She's not thereÃ¢??
Kissed me in the rain by the Rue Voltaire
It's a perfectly good way to ruin those silk shoes

Still, seven hours
Nothing but clouds
It's enough to make your heart sigh
We should try
For each other and for the lovers

Ooh we crash into love-filled nights
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
Ooh we race till we're out of time
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
And now that you've taken me up so high
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

You change and you grow
But we were young
We were young and we didn't know
We didn't know

It says everything. Explains everything.

So don't just stand there wishing life would fade away.

Good and bad paradise.
I hope that someday you could try.
Good and bad just some change that you give it all away.
Goodbye, goodbye.

Saw your face in a faded light.
Said everything, explained everything.

In home saw you dazed and it comes to you a lie.
You did everything, blamed anything.

But don't you cut those ribbons to take away the pain.
Don't you go around with that same old crowd
That makes you feel ashamed.

Good and bad paradise.
I hope that someday you could try.

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see

And Grace, my fears relieved
How precious did that Grace appear

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
and Grace will lead me home

His word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be,

As long as life endures

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil,

We've no less days to sing God's praise

When the leaves are down I'll be southward bound
Hunters hunt the outsider.
When the wind grows cold, when the sun grows old,
Nothing holds the outsider

Just killed a man in a town called Nightfall
Damned if I can't remember it all
My hand it was shaking but his talk it was tall
I paid for the funeral crew
And it seems like I never reach Mexico
They're heading me off every place that I go
I'm sick of the fact that I've got to lay low
What else can an outsider do

I know they're near to me, I don't have to see
Just let me be the outsider
They ain't far behind, they're always on my mind
They won't find the outsider
The outsider

When the leaves are down I'll be southward bound
Hunter's haunt the outsider.
When the wind grows cold, when the sun grows old,
Nothing holds the outsider

Can't seem to find the words or thoughts, 
These hazy eyes, the perfect partner to my weary mind, 
And its not been a matter of days 
In fact its felt like an age since I last sat down or, 
Saw a town that wasn't linked by shores. 

And fatigues soon ignored, 
As your feet hit the board, or as the beat hits the floor, 
These are the moments that we live for, 
The ones who constantly try, to appease our nine to fives 
They are the ones that justify, all the things that we forsake. 

You are not your job, and you are not the clothes you wear, 
You are the words that leave your mouth so speak up, speak up loud, 
For none of us want to sit, 
In evaluations taking notes for hours, 
We're all sick and tired of waiting, lets set sail.

As your feet hit the board, or the beat hits the floor, 
These are the moments that we live for, 
The ones who constantly try, to appease our nine to fives

Why do we look to the tide when, 
We find that our minds are getting stale, 
Why does it bag me this place on the waves, 
And are we looking for meaning, from demeaning, 
The soul destroying task, 
We do all the time on the shore. 

And as I picture you on the television, 
Talking all the seller hook past all the people walking, 
Its about then that I realise that your the same as me, 
So call me Ishmael, we are all striving for, 
The thing that makes this grind worth surviving baby, 
I won't wait long for one little moment, 
Where our dream's to feel alive.

Get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen now add the other two that Mega bringing through

now it's time to throw the nine clip in, mission revenge
once was friends, now that shit's dead
that stupid muthafucka shoulda shot me in the head
so I went to Brooklyn and met with Dread
and told Dread, I want the pussy clot shot dead
that nigga started a war fuckin with me yo
hit me with a four-four and jetted with a kilo
he hit me in the chest
lucky I was wearing a vest, but the impact hurt my fuckin flesh
right after he left, I noticed I was bleeding by my neck
and I was type-scared to death
yo, I blacked out
I woke up, my man had the mac out
said we gonna get the nigga back no doubt
he told me to rest
I seen my nigga standing at the door with a tec 
in case a muthafucker flex
I told him how the muthafuckin kid co-flipped
and he said parlay son, payback's a bitch
yo, shit is real, I feel better
word out on the street is that a four-four can't stop Mega
the nigga musta heard I didn't die, son he hidin'
I snatched up his man inside a van and started drivin'
his man started dymin'
said the nigga drivin' in 735 and he knows where to find him
cool, tell my man to drop the kid off
soon as we hit the next darn block, blew his fuckin wig off
now that's one down, one nigga to go
just drive slow so we don't have to worry 'bout five-o
now it's time to get even, 
we in, five jeeps deep with the mad heat and steamin
oh shit, I see him, he gettin out the seven
my man started wetting at the nigga with a mac-11
I specialize in war
now it's time to blow him, I'ma show him how to use a fuckin four-four
I said ""yo son, ya games over""
I let off, and yo my shit was spittin fire like a flamethrower
he started wettin back

when he flung, I think his lungs collapsed

And the legs of pant slugs that crack the shin bone
The Other shot blasts through your left clavical
Melt swizz suits and paint the avenue's
Havoc
How you want it? Bent Scheme or straight blunted
Many are rare, rore, Havoc has just over done it
While you sitting there whispering like a little girl
Fuck, waiting around till the dutchy gets twirled
We going at you, not cause we want to but cause we have to
To avoid the situation that you couldn't last through
If I can't have it at all I don't want it at all
Off top serious dogg, I'm out for the raw
Back to the world, the shit that I kick will dazzle your girl
Handle your bitch, can't then take her for pearl
Get him with the pink slip, get him bent to he hurl
Hennessy got my mind locked, tight in a curl
Hold it down like Saddam you can't search my click
Even with dirty worms I'm gonna still appear
How you want it, bent scheme or straight blunted (2x)
Cormega
Yo, my pen is sick like a heroin add-dict, Whenever Mega spits
Exhale preciseness, Drug Dealer Ghetto shit
Sweat in my hand, plus the finger numb from measuring grams
Gun on my waist, In case I see son 
who wetted my man
I be Gortexing to death, rocking ice with special fx's
Obvious I was destined to rep
Yo my persona is the drama, my Infamous Congrommalits
Considered mad real, niggas feel the Montana shit
Born official, my niggas that are gone I miss you
I shed a tear, see ya'll niggas when I get there
Yo my dun did six years and still didn't hit the strip
I'm waiting on the day, when Rikers Island ciphers are incomplete
When I can sleep with no heat, hidden beneath the sheet
And I can relax with my air max, appearing on my feet
When I rhyme you enter my mind, Seeing nigga's lead to excellence
I represented then manifested in the beat....Respect this
Like a Lexus jeep
My technique
Leaves my enemies stretched for weeks, vexed from me
Especially they know my destiny, man they scared to death of me
Can't even question me, I serve them like stretching ki's...please

Yo, I write rhymes, for niggas at night time
Consider your life mine
Whether you pumpin 5 packs or 5 dimes
My time I'm livin' it, my persona eminent
Real niggas don't keep beef we finish it
No retreat, no surrenderin
No rockin me to sleep
I keep the heat up in my premises
A whole different level of rhyme several of my
Competitors try comin better than mine
Verbally I'm way ahead of my time, Mega
Immortalized through words
Son I'm livin off the time you served
Stay focused, keep a eye open for straight vultures
Everybody gotta go, everydays a day closer
I'm soakin in my sofa, Reminiscin Tony coked up
Life is fucked up, even when you blow up

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Lil Wayne: Who can ya trust?
Mega: Only a few and my nine will bust
Lil Wayne: What do you lust?
Mega: The money and the power nigga
Lil Wayne: Who you respect?
Mega: All my niggas that's no longer with us
And all the drug king pins who showed us how ta get up

[Cormega]
Who's the nicest nigga spittin a trife shit
Ghetto drama, Sagas for niggas with enditements, flippin white shit
Screamin fuck the feds
Squeezing ya heat at police till your cuffed to your hospital bed
Thug general, write rhymes for criminals to listen to
If you ain't real, my shit ain't even meant for you
My pen stain the paper like blood
My mind is like a nine and my rhyme is like a slug
Before I snitch like a bitch, I'd rather die like a thug
If they arraign me for bangin I throw my sign up at the judge, I'm almighty
Defy me, feel the 44 beside me
Red light to guide me to your vital point
With my heat I anoint you a second from death
My only regret, is that I emptied out my whole clip in your soul BIATCH

[Chorus]

[Cormega]
To my thugs, its unconditional love I'm givin you
I've been out the motha fuckin system too
Hunger pains when I was younger made me ready 2 face
Consequences of life the streets fed me
Ready rock chop the pumped I bought my high top dunks
And crack fiends only a baby nah, hold up
The sense of shit I just made up in the rhyme this is the realness
In a reflection of a sinner I spit
Yo feel this, my name alone had me maintainin a phone
On a come through not to mention the banger I hold
Ain't nothing new why would I front for you
I'm a felony offender, you showin your jealousy nigga

[Chorus]
