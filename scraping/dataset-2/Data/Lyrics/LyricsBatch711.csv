Melody Gardot,"I won't wake up To the sound of your feet
Walking down the hall
Like a soft heartbeat I won't wake up
Cause by the time that I do you'll be gone

I won't look back
On a past so long
I won't look back
On the things gone wrong
I won't look back
Cause by the time that I do you'll be gone.

I won't have words I've said all that there is to say
I won't have words
Cause I know you'll just throw them away
I won't have words
Cause by the time that I do you'll be gone

By the time that I do you'll be gone
By the time that I do you'll be gone",Gone,2006
Melody Gardot,"Goodnite
Close your eyes and just sleep tight
I'll lie awake and watch you dream
To be sure that all of your dreams are pure

My dear don't you worry bout a thing
I'll be near to you all night
And through the evening
I'll be by your side

So Goodnite
Close your eyes and just sleep tight
I'll lie awake and watch you dream
To be sure that all of your dreams are pure

Know its me

And Goodnite
Close your eyes and just sleep tight
I'll lie awake and watch you dream
To be sure that all of your dreams are pure",Goodnite,2006

Melody Gardot,"Well I'm buckled up inside
It's a miracle that I'm alive
I do not think I can survive
On bread and wine alone
To think that I could have fallen
A centimeter to the left
Would not be here to see the sunset
Or have myself a time

Well why do the hands of time
So easily unwind

Some lessons we learn the hard way
Some lessons don't come easy
That's the price we have to pay
Some lessons we learn the hard way
They don't come right off and right easy
That's why they say some lessons learned we learn the hard way

Remember the sound of the pavement
World turned upside down
City streets unlined and empty
Not a soul around
Life goes away in a flash
Right before your eyes
If I think real hard well I reckon I've had some real good times

Well why do the hands of time
So easily unwind

Some lessons we learn the hard way
Some lessons don't come easy
That's the price we have to pay
Some lessons we learn the hard way
They don't come right off and right easy
That's why they say some lessons learned we learn the hard way",Some Lessons,2006

Talking bout a sweet memory
It goes round and round in my head

Not a tear comes to my eye

Melody Gardot,"There comes a time in every little girl's life
When her momma says,
Girl, do your best

Cause one day you may come to find
That all of your life has been a wicked ride
There comes a time in every young woman's life
When all of the men though they come and again
Its hardly enough to survive

And she starts to think life is a wicked ride
There comes a time in every old woman's life
When she takes a look in her picture book

Melody Gardot,"Your eyes may be whole
But the story I'm told
Is that your heart is as black as night

Your lips may be sweet
Such that I can't compete

At such a perfect time

Melody Gardot,"How was I to know that this was always only just a little game to you?
All the time I felt you gave your heart I thought that I would do the same for you,
Tell the truth I think I should have seen it coming from a mile away,
When the words you say are,

Baby I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall in love?
If I gave a thought to fascination I would know it wasn't right to care,
Logic doesn't seem to mind that I am fascinated by the love affair,
Still my heart would benefit from a little tenderness from time to time, but never mind,
Cause baby I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall in love

Baby I should hold on just a moment and be sure it's not for vanity,
Look me in the eye and tell me love is never based upon insanity,
Even when my heart is beating hurry up the moment?s fleeting,
Kiss me now,
Don't ask me home

Cause baby I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall,
Baby I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall,
And I would never tell if you became a fool and fell in love.",Baby I'm a Fool,2009
Melody Gardot,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I heard of, once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow, why then, oh, why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh, why can't I?",Over the Rainbow,2009
Melody Gardot,"You ever want something 
That you know you shouldn't have 
The more you know you shouldn't have it, 
The more you want it 
And then one day you get it, 
It's so good too 
But it's just like my girl 
When she's around me 
I just feel so good, so good 
But right now I just feel cold, so cold 
Right down to my bones 
'Cause oh
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
It's not warm when she's away

Melody Gardot,"Deep within the corners of my mind
I keep a memory of your faces
And I only pull it out when I long for your embrace

Deep within the corners of my mind
I'm haunted by your smile
As it promises me joys like a journey to a tropic isle
It's not hard to see what you do to me
It's like a page right out of fist time wave
Though I try to fight it all the word you write
Leave me standing in the starry robe in some tragic lovers place

But deep within the corners of my mind
I'm praying secretly that eventually in time
There'll be a place for you and me

That eventually in time
There'll be a place for you and me

There'll be a place for you and me

Melody Gardot,"If the stars were mine
I'd give them all to you
I'd pluck them down right from the sky
And leave it only blue
I would never let the sun forget to shine upon your face
So when others would have rain clouds you'd have only sunny days
If the stars were mine
I'd tell you what I'd do
I'd put the stars right in a jar and give them all to you

If the birds were mine
I'd tell them when to sing
I'd make them sing a sonnet when your telephone would ring
I would put them there inside the square, whenever you went out
So there'd always be sweet music whenever you would walk about
If the birds were mine
I'd tell you what I'd do
I'd teach the birds such lovely words and make them sing for you
I'd teach the birds such lovely words and make them sing for you

If the world was mine
I'd paint it gold and green
I'd make the oceans orange for a brilliant color scheme
I would color all the mountains, make the sky forever blue
So the world would be a painting and I'd live inside with you
If the world was mine
I'd tell you what I'd do
I'd wrap the world in ribbons and then give it all to you

Give them all to you",If The Stars Were Mine,2009

The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,

The kind you only hear of in cinematic dreams

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1994

Fall back under my wing
Let go of my mind, let it swing
Let em wait

I know it felt good, let it marinate
Multiple O's, increase your heart rate
So relax,
I put my lips on every inch of your back
Lookin good, I got plans for that
It's my pleasure to fall into your trap
Love the world baby, I was running lately

Head in my lap
Massaging your ears, you like that
I bite your bottom lip, you bite back
I know it's good, I don't need you to tell me that
Kiss yo neck
Ignore the main spot getting wet
Pressure's built up high as it can get
So we flows like the pilot, press the jet
Let it stretch
For all the times you seduced me in the tracks
All the chasin' I did so you can catch
Now all I do is shine and move back

Bottom out,
Kissing with your fingers in my mouth
I'm taking all different routes
Discovering the ins and the outs
You slide to the couch
I wanna see what that love seat is about
Work it til it looks like a pout
Too many climaxes to count
Love your world baby, yea it was born lately
Did a 1-80, crazy

There's something about the way you do
The things you do

So I?ll tell you in this simple song
I'm not asking for your sympathy

She broke his heart, he spent his whole life trying to forget
We watched him drink away his pain a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night

He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And he finally blew away her memory
Life is short, this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees

We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, I love her till I die
And when they buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

For years and years, she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath

And she finally blew away his memory

Clinging to his picture for dear life
They laid her next to him beneath the willow

I rode a dream so wild and free for all that dream was worth
True love is both a blessing and a curse
I guess my heart just settled back to earth

I remember what you said that night so long ago
My dream for you had ended and you let me know
So I bounced from sky to sky, tryin' to keep the dream alive
But everything I did just made it worse

The songs our love created, I still sing
And every night we'd make the rafters ring
And tonight I'll sing for everything I'm worth
For all the hearts that settle back to earth

Can you get me to work?
My clock is late and I'm not
Don't take any notice of this
It's this widow outside my window
Be apart of vicious kind of web in my head
Toss me something it took a while
'Til I found a way to loose so

Don't save me anymore
Don't save me anymore
Don't want to anymore
Don't save me anymore

",Don't Save Me,2004
Melpo Mene,"Oh, my fortune has left me for books
And all my distance to work on a plan
Makes a simple and ugly affair
Well, I hope that you

Dream about, dream about, dream about me
But no, you think yourself is this right

And am I in love with a fool then I don't wanna go
Might be people to stun with a single routine
And you don't, you don't dream at all

Am I thoughtful to miss you today?
I've been painting my grief on the wall
Everyday falls behind me I know
Well, I hope that you

Dream about, dream about, dream about me
But no, you think yourself is this right

And am I in love with a fool then I don't wanna go
Might be people to stun with a single routine
And you'll find that I'm not even attractive at all
So I make myself pretty with makeup and a wig

",Dream About Me,2004
Melpo Mene,"If I am good with the mothers
Then perhaps it can help me when
I find my way to the daughters
Oh, I wish they were easier

When yes is no and stay is go
How can I remember
Nevermind this is fine
Thanks for the poem, oh

If I am good with the fathers
Then perhaps it can help me then
I just happened to be bad with brothers
Oh, I wish this was easier

",Good with the Mothers,2004
Melpo Mene,"Rain so I said
""The umbrellas on the wall""
And you said
""If you like me let's go out""

So this is it
Are we digital no days
And you left
And the disco tech you tense

Now with this ring
I ask you to be mine
And it's sad
'Cause I know it's only dreams

Go into space
For a day inside my ship
And I said
There's a thought with being two

I'm in sorry shape but I'm not

I am a lady if you save me
I'm getting so old and
You don't know that I'm alright

Melpo Mene,"I have thought now for a while
And I confess that I've turned it into a mess
From my window what is this
Two billion objects thinking what they should do

People are dots from my castle and I think
Someone tells me it's useless thinking

But that doesn't do much for me
So many details there are
I want to see everyone
I want to know everything

Yeah, could use Superglue for all my thoughts
And he's losing weight for his other shirt
A boxer is sad 'cause of ache in his head
And someone in space is taking pictures of us

On the flip side this is awful
I see my notes turning into clichés
And I hate it when I'm deep
It wears me out and my feelings are flat

I just can't unfold it

",To Be Someone,2004
Melpo Mene,"Maybe it's a note that wasn't meant
To be sent to her
And I'm sure it's all about love
So anyway I won't take it

Oh, what lovely handwriting
So very old and artful to me
And I thought to myself
Maybe I'm adorable, but I don't know

I don't go there, I don't go there
Out of my league, out of my league

Tropical philosophy
I swim a couple of laps everyday
Well, I guess that there's room
For everyone around if you want

Female invasion in a bottle
Without label, let's see
Yes, I'll pass it on to someone else
'Cause I can not afford my home

If I need love, it's in my head
If I need love, it's in my head
If I need friends, my pocket's full
If I need things, my pocket's full
If I need you, you're in my head
If I need you, you're in my head

Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby
Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby

?Cause when you kissed my lips
When you kissed my lips
I was jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time
Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

Baby, I was young, I was green
When you showed me the ropes 10 years ago
I thought I was cool, I could break all the rules

I was a girl from the streets
Dancin' to the beat
Of a different kind of drummer
Little Ms. Know-it-all, you don't know it all

Caught up in the rhythm of sound
Living to get down
As the song became my lover
Attitude keeps your head up to the sky

Then you kissed my lips and, ooh
I lost my cool

Look at me I'm jammin'
And everything's happenin'
I'm feeling the bliss and the reason for this
Is the love in your kiss, baby
Jammin'

Jammin', jammin'

?Cause when you kissed my lips
And my backbone slipped
I was jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

The square root of a positive groove
Times a happening melody equals a jam
Give some to the back

No
Ooh, baby
No
You got me movin' and I'm jammin' for the first time

No

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Melvin Seals,"Early one mornin' the sun was shinin',
I was layin' in bed
Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red.
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
And I was standin' on the side of the road
Rain fallin' on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through,
Tangled up in blue.

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess,
But I used a little too much force.
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best.
She turned around to look at me
As I was walkin' away
I heard her say over my shoulder,
""We'll meet again someday on the avenue,""
Tangled up in blue.

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell.
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
Right outside of Delacroix.
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind,
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Tangled up in blue.

She was workin' in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer,
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear.
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's just about to do the same,
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me, ""Don't I know your name?""
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,
She studied the lines on my face.
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Tangled up in blue.

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said
""You look like the silent type.""
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century.
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin' coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you,
Tangled up in blue.

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs,
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air.
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died.
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside.
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn,
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,
Tangled up in blue.

So now I'm goin' back again,
I got to get to her somehow.
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now.
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives.
Don't know how it all got started,
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same,
We just saw it from a different point of view,

Melvin Seals & JGB,"Early one mornin' the sun was shinin',
I was layin' in bed
Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red.
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
And I was standin' on the side of the road
Rain fallin' on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through,
Tangled up in blue.

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess,
But I used a little too much force.
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best.
She turned around to look at me
As I was walkin' away
I heard her say over my shoulder,
""We'll meet again someday on the avenue,""
Tangled up in blue.

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell.
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
Right outside of Delacroix.
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind,
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Tangled up in blue.

She was workin' in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer,
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear.
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's just about to do the same,
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me, ""Don't I know your name?""
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,
She studied the lines on my face.
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Tangled up in blue.

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said
""You look like the silent type.""
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century.
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin' coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you,
Tangled up in blue.

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs,
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air.
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died.
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside.
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn,
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,
Tangled up in blue.

So now I'm goin' back again,
I got to get to her somehow.
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now.
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives.
Don't know how it all got started,
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same,
We just saw it from a different point of view,
Tangled up in blue.",Tangled Up in Blue,2005

He won't let you down,
And I know He's mine forever,
Ah, in my heart.

I want to follow your star wherever it leads me,
And I don't mind Lord, I hope you don't mind.
I want to walk with you, and talk with you,
And do all the things you want me to do,
'Cause I know that Jesus, Jesus is love, I know,
And if you ask, I'll show love is the word forever,
 
Ah, in my heart, help me, heart, heart.
I know, I know, I know, I know His love's the power,
His love's the glory forever, ever, ever, ever.
Who can bring you love?
Who can bring you joy?
Who can turn your life around?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
 
Who will pick you up, ooh, where you fall?
Who will stand beside you? Who will love us all?
Hey, Jesus, Jesus.
 
Who can heal your body?  Who can make it strong?
Who can help you to hold out a little while longer?
Oh yeah, Jesus loves you, Jesus wants you,
You can call Him, He will answer.

Melvin Williams,"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
And I think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories
Time after
Sometimes you picture me 
And I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, and I can't hear
What you've said
Then you say go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look, you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after

My picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows you're wondering
If I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time 

If you're lost you can look, you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting

I cry when you cry

Sometimes wonder why am I going through
I'm waiting but still no use

Your job and your life
Weighs on your mind
All day and all night
You know every scripture
And what prayer to pray
Only a fool would think
It'll all go away
But there is a use
For you there's a plan
A High Priest who knows
And who understands what you cannot say
Just a little longer can you wait

Don't know what tomorrow will bring
Or if this sickness will ever leave
You can paint a perfect picture
But will it ever look like it used to be
See, one thing I know for sure
This season made you stronger and more mature
Can't you see how far you've come
And when you look back
It's gonna be worth it, oooh

Of the city of New Orleans, bound by drugs, bound by alcohol
Committing the different acts of sin, living beneath my privilege
Doing things that were contrary to God as well as the law
But after all the things that I did
And after all the sins that I committed
One day I heard about Jesus
I'm just like the woman that heard about Jesus
Coming through the city of Jericho, and she had a problem
But I had a problem with lying too and lying was sin
I was living in sin, living and doing things I wanted to do
Living and seeing what I wanted to see
But one day Jesus touched my life
And when Jesus came in, the liquor went out, the drugs went out
My old lady, the lord bleeds
I thank God my sins and judge every
And I have a right to the tree
Doesn't mean jack to me and everyone that knows Jesus and everyone that's been born again 
And everyone that's been washed in the blood
You heard the brother singing about the blood
It's stuff about the blood 
It's stuff about the blood of Jesus and wash away your sins
And wash your mind and wash your heart and wash your life, oh praise God
I thank God for that opportunity and I just want to let you know
That he loves us and the Bible backs it up
""That God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son
That whoever should believe in him shall not perish but have an everlasting life.""

Then we buit upon this ground something we thought was sound
But in reality was silence
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I only picked up your story knowing you were lying
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help yourself
When I look back now I plainly see
The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears
Sometimes I wish I was asleep
And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I keep dropping those hints but they never touched the ground
I'm useless to you now
You'll have to learn yourself to help yourself
I had never planned on this being so complicated
You had never planned on us being so separated
The spiteful words will heal with time
Eventually they rhyme
You can forget but not forgive the fact that I still live
And never wanted you to give... in
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
You weren't satisfied I was only superhuman
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help...
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
Well I could only stand sitting here so long
You don't need my help
You'll have to learn to help yourself

Members of the West Los Angeles Children's Choir,"Staring blindly through blizzard
Chasing after your restless heart
Mind is buzzing like Helicopter
Cutting quickly through the dark

Smoke is pouring from my windows
And I'm reaching out my hand
Hoping someone's at my fingertip
That can help me understand

That we've all got the sun to follow
That we've all got the sun to follow-ow-ow
Hold on, hold on
The stars are bound to change
Hold on, hold on
Wait for another day
Hold on, hold on
The future's not that far away-ay

Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa

Yelling for the sun as the water rises
Feeling like smoke, filling up your eyes
Swinging at a ghost, go and lock that door
Leave that wreckage, let it wash ashore

Go save yourself up, it's a hell of a ride
Feel your heart racing in the middle of the night
Step out of your mind into the wild, wild, wild, wild

That we've all got the sun to follow
That we've all got the sun to follow-ow-ow
Hold on, hold on
The stars are bound to change
Hold on, hold on
Wait for another day
Hold on, hold on

Hold on, hold on

Would believe
You too might be

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me

Be mine

Will find

Memento,"Never will you find the reasons
Sand is just a broken stone
Love it changes with the seasons
In the dark I read the lines upon your hand
Junkies, intellects and preachers
All addicted to your clans
Caged by ribs sits the believer
With less friends than fingers on one hand

When silence speaks free
When no ones home
When cold and lucid
When bruised and torn
Look into your abyss
Nothing tastes like this
Look into....

Is what you see here what you wanted?
No soft lens, no violins
Like the gray eyes of a dead man
The mirror always stares

I've got a little riddle in my head
What's the little riddle in your head?

Look into your abyss
",Abyss,2003
Memento,"What have you done?
Yes I'm talking to you
Your only son
The one you dressed in nails
I know how hard it is for you to show

Show your love
For your love I take
The nails and thorns
That will never be enough
Still I beg and crawl
For your God-damned love

I've just begun
To understand your ways
You need blood
So no one goes away
I know how hard it is for you to show

Turn the other cheek again
Will I?
Maybe let me in this time

Show your love
For your love I take

I'm your son
For your God-damned love

Memento,"In this gray harbour of tears we are capsizing
Still waters belie the current that drags us down
Without a sun shallow waters can only be black
As cold and as weathered as the leaves
That clog your dead mouth
What the f*** is wrong with us people?
What the f*** is wrong with you people?

Looking down your nose judging me f*****
Looking down your nose from the same mother
Looking down your nose, judge, judge f*****
As we sink below

Could you have walked on water with two led feet?
This epiphany reached whilst breathing through a straw
Conscience is the only weak link in my ball and chain
I've been making excuses for things I've done to myself
What the f*** is wrong with us people?
What the f*** is wrong with you people?

Down, down, down down down

Every father is a war

Any road that gets you home

You are still dead to me

Coming out of hibernation

The shivers and the tingles in your spine
The dirty pins and needles in your eyes

Twisting and turning between one and ten

Beginning of the end.....

Living in my machine
Pulses beneath gray skin
Torso deep in unanswered whys
Let your habit anesthetise
Letting the insects in
Beggars that breed within
Swing from your chain, enjoy your ride
Just a blind man swimming against the tide
Two circles, one cycle, a figure of 8
Where loves becomes hate

Beginning at the end of the beginning of the end
Twisting and turning inside you
Denial becomes you
Make your demons your friends
Flying with your noxious wings
Crying through your toxic lens
Denial betrayed you
Make your demons your friends

Inner anomaly
Where self slaughter is peace
Mutating into a silver whale
Beaching yourself to spite the grail
Turning from fish to frog
Come sleep with my dead God
Calluses bloom on the hand of grace
The snake is sleeping, dreaming of Eve's face
Two circles, one cycle, a figure of 8
Where the trap is the escape

Cognition is prison, cognition is prison
Birth, life, death, rust
Feed this cruel lust
Cognition is prison, cognition is prison

Goodbye, I hope to see you in another life
Goodnight, I know I'll see you from a clearer sky
No pain, no blame
Just a naked and a loving eye
Goodbye

Love goes on
I hope you all enjoyed your ride
Love goes on
I hope we find ourselves in time

I don't need your mantra
I don't need your crosses
I don't need to hold on
I don't need to let go
If my eyes are black
You'll just have to find me
Careful where you look
You'll end up where I am

The end of the beginning, the beginning of the end
Twisting and turning between one and ten
The puzzle never ends, make your demons your friends
It's the end of a road that leads right back to
The beginning....

One life, I gotta make sure it's done right
Cause them yet to have a conversation bout reincarnation

Stick thick chicks, try to tear they wall out

Hard to concentrate on school with stomach pain

Gettin fly is the minimal, holdin somethin is the principal
Respect this young nigga that's, holdin the torch
Preachin shit like the crack game, don't take shorts
Throw it down it's a bet, nigga roll hard

come out of the woodworks, if they think you stack paper

Why don't you go get lost
Get out of here, go kick a freestyle or something

You're now tuned into the greatest
Motherfuckers can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us
Can't touch it, fuck it, can't see em, try to be em
Both shows sold out your coliseum, 8th wonder
Locked rap for trey summers, poker faces with the aces under
Face one up, to take over, the break's over
Nigga I'm the god MC, me, Jay Hovah
Shit knocking, almost a crime, get Cochran
Banging to the hearse where my doctors hand
Hot land, FBI, DEA, I did crime, got away
They want to see me pay, motherfuckers better ride
If they try to plant, under the seat of my car
Even a half a gram, better flame those, plainclothes
Same goes for lame hoes, cocaine rapper
Rep ya game pros

We celebrate this, while you sitting back screaming you hate this
Try to rape this, get caught in my crime matrix
Spitting sperm inside of latex
You get, no respect like a child rapist
Delegate this, men just giving face lifts
Leave your melon spacious, career felon, no hiatus
Nor Caesar's, the CIA flooded my block with diseases
Informants, heating the spot up like global warming
Who start shit? my style is laced with arsenic
Odorless tasteless, cause of death is traceless
I know you want to see me wasted
You call the order, I'll be in hell
Team Roc sweater and ice water
Righteous, dominate the global, my life's a novel
Blazing in Barnes and Noble, idolize the vocals

I'm resident evil, moving like ?

Millionaire that flow like water, rap niggas running
I, oughta applaud ya, clap at ya
Point the mac at yea, niggas caught up
Brought up in the rapture, my flows torture
Like a compound fracture, can't fuck with it
For the love of sex money and drugs
Affiliated with the sets tecs honies and thugs
Let the four power, rain on niggas like a spring shower
And bring flowers for the bodies that surround us
If you was looking you found us
Moving with speed, tried to play superman
Ended up like Chris Reeves
Paraplegic, precise minds like the Pharaoh's of Egypt
Shot through a barrel niggas narrowly weaved it
Keeping my team top seeded with the sweet 16's
Bulging out of my jeans, on the ten-speed weeded
Holding, ? shots with you like a secret
It's like a story never told, but believe it

Street anthem anchor, quick to trade shots just like a banker
Lick a round, niggas hit the ground like Sanka
I got ya screw face in forty-two ways, aim better
Than toothpaste, Jerry McGuire
""Show me the money"" like clue tapes
Run up in your spot with a few eights, zoning
Known men, home in, all of my homies condone sin
Four shots spin ya like chrome rims
Put a part right through your dome like the omen, foaming
White sheets got ya wrapped like a roman
Back in new york, honey wants it, just spit blood and talk funny
Niggas is cartoons, picture styles that's fully developed
Like dark rooms, hits fat, cub with a harpoon
Heat-seeking, grill hunting, still fronting?
Keep squeezing, fuck it, I leave the whole street wheezing
No motherfuckers hope I fail, and gotta provoke the frail
Got em scared to drop like soap in jail

Didn't listen to stuff took another puff of the chieva
They said believe us or not trust is somethin' you earn
With every mistake you make back to us you return
Probably would go Hollywood I thought he was jokin'
My first taste of fame I hit the first thing smokin'
All engulfed into honeys the pussy was tight
If she threw the pussy right I got mushy like
Damn baby I love you take all my cash
""You ain't got to lie Jay,"" you already gettin' the ass
She loved that I was a thug it turned her on
Soon as I got soft it turned her off
I got relaxed put my feet up start dissin' my friends

Nothin' worse than the person that's foul with guts
To stick you quicker

Yup this is the foulest this ain't Hollywood
It's the Wild West whoever guns is the loudest
That's who's the best now take ten steps and draw
Who dope can take ten steps and remain raw
Who has no regards for the law?
Me that's who now let me ask you
Did you not know if we all don't eat
Some day that we all would beef?
Did you know about the crabs in the barrow
They would hear me creep
It's a muthafuckin' war in these streets
I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto
And I'm back again I'm back again

It's beef I'ma see you, and bang til you hang up
Your life on line, but here's the truth
You ain't hype to die, but you hype to shoot
You let the Henny talk for you, you really a bitch
Why the D's know your name 'cause you really a snitch

[Chorus: x2]]
Got my mind right, money right, ready for war
(Memph Bleek Is) (Murder) yeah told you before
I got the streets locked, Bleek hot as before
You know the game and the name now I'm ready for war

[Verse 2]
(Memph Bleek Is) back for the streets
Knowing that (Coming of Age) controlling the creep
Put in work on these streets, busting my heat
Dodging the Ds, you know it's a margin between me
And only a few fit in, your lifestyle's written
So who you supposed to be, play your position
I used to write to the wall, about the Porsche
Now I write for the house and the rob report
I used to think, Bleek and the baddest bitch
Now the, baddest bitch is a average bitch
All I need her is for head and to stash my lead
Push my V, take this key to hempstead
And you run through backwoods, I twist backwoods
And greenery, sha shoo with heavy machinery
You know exactly who these streets belong to
B.I.G. done warned you, and I'ma run up on you, nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Hey yo I think I'm the best, from coast to coast
I'm above rap cats, they know what I gross
What they make from they album, I do at my show
Your advance is what, I spent that when I was broke
I ship gold, you better watch me now
Many middle in this game, at the top I'm found
I wanted these cats, repping my hood, then go back
Be on the same old bench, with the same old rap
I'm from Marcy, you see them cars we buy
Seats up, smoke blunts, with my concubine
Twin, P-89 for you two fake fagots
Tucked under the lining of the Roc-A-Wear fabric
Fuck why y'all, you know the squad be 'bout
Anything that involve dollar signs and accounts
It's the M dot E M P H man stop
I bought see a watch, next day I bought a house

(Memphis Bleek)
Nigga, picture me hot, then picture me not
In this spot with this glock and these rocks to cops
I know every basehead from here to the wasteland
With keys, and connects me and Cease ???
Sell water from the cookpot, ain't that raw?
My razors? 20 dollars, here's a case of four
You supply that, shit I put a hole where your mind at
Push your hairline back, fucking with this sly cat
You know exactly what I'm talking about (Clue!)
You know the game and this life, what this thug about
One of the last real niggas trying to get in the game
But the verse on the first on the strip getting paid
You feel me? Niggas spending ??? for the jewelry
Then run around frontin like they money is filthy
I'm in the game to clean minds, fuck you want?
I had coke for too long, I supply that boat

[Chorus] (Ja Rule)
This life we gon' live it up
When the dough gets tough we gon' get it up
Anybody hate on us, we hit 'em up
Baby we can't be touched, niggas give it up (Repeat x2)

Yo, yo!
When it's on it's on, writing's on the floor
Guts in his bed, the blood's on us all
Before he hit the floor, Bleek hit him some more
I've been in the spot, pop the buscuit, the coke out the drawer
Here niggas grimy, we take ends out your pockets
I want the kid's pictures and the cars and the wallets
He wants them big things like them ?Tits? and ?Dolly Partons?
Got mad bodies, ?Roy is hotter than Cochran?
Besides niggas albums, a lot about dropping
Fuck break dancing, our guns do the popping
We don't stop, we drop, shut it down
Rock the undergrounds, cock then gun 'em down
Now, you want war? Fuck guns, bring grenades
Fuck all you sons that's dockin that shade
Niggas be fronting, acting like they in Hollyhood
I catch a nigga slipping I'm popping two in his hood

[Chorus] (Ja Rule)
This life we gon' live it up
When the dough gets tough we gon' get it up
Anybody hate on us, we hit 'em up
Baby we can't be touched, niggas give it up (Repeat x2)

Ja's in, robbing the game, paws up niggas
Time's up niggas, line up niggas

Shit's on y'all in every way shape and form
I'm a diamond baller, I bear arms
When the god ??? ??? ???
The game is me, cause the game I eat breathe sleep
Wake up, conceal the heat and throw a blade in my cheek
Hit the streets, ?hands in the mind?, toes hands and the nine
The see-through niggas get flipped like mini-pies, ??? she lies Niggas stepped on, by the way and still getting slept on
What you think? You _Murdering, Inc._? Who put you in pink? Perform many bumps at the brink, you fucking with some hot spitters
Bear with us or bear witness, live to die, it's on nigga!

Memphis Bleek,"Ughh ughh yeah 
This is Beanie Seigel 
That Philly cat playin' wit that silly rap 
Put your weight up not your hate up niggas 
You know how you play quiet towns and tie 'em down 
Haters wonderin' how I got my position with rock 
'Cause I listen to The Lox and I to watch 
While you still sittin' in spot ditchin' the cops 
I'm in the Porsche Box with Fox listen and watch 
War still gray, Lexus, GS4 
Doesn't even meddle when the dogg pedal to the floor 
I'm routin' down South, for my aim it to score 
Eight cylinder, screamin' 'Fuck the law!' 
Got a tank full of gas, trunk full of cash 
Hammies in the stash, scandels in the dash 
Radar detectors, troopers can't find us 
We bubbled down ATL and hit the 'Linas 
Then get clubbed with some Dirty South thugs 
Ball out thugs, go in your house thugs 
Talk shit, put blood in your mouth thugs 
36 South thugs, stay on route thugs 
You know how Mac play, quiet town, tie it down 
I supply it now, by the pound 
Might front you with a cube if you buy a pound 
If you didn't try it then, why would you try it now? 
Then 'cause Mac rap, wouldn't fire a round 
Til you frown, I lay you down and retire you clown 
And I clap niggas, Mac niggas kiss the dirt 
Pat-pat with the deuce deuce, it'll work 
Bitch ass niggas wearin' thongs and skirts 
Catch 'em early in the mornin' while they goin' to work 
You pretty motherfuckers stay stuck in the mirror 
And you weak ass niggas only buss out the fair 
I know y'all softer than them feathers that get stuffed in the rear 
I pack barettas, never bust in their ear 
Twist your shit back, spit til my gat sit back 
Pack four pieces like a Kit Kat. Heh, get that? 
Cock Cris bottle like a six-pack, Range Roll dot six that 
Benz Coupe, drop six that 
Buggy eye seven come out? Shit, took the six pack 
Switch the Double are, the Double are's are, gotta get that 
You see how we play, pop Cris on the E-Way 
Soakin' the sea, gettin' drunk with glee 
Only the sharp bar, grill Simon, pop Don P 
While you chickin' when you chasin' your how with hot tea 
Niggas flashin' that money like it's they money 
Slack 500 on back of a tree twenty 
I'm bringin' it to any nigga tryin' to servine (yeah) 
With them bullshit buggy I kiss 'em CDs 
Memphis Bleek: 
Check it out, yo, yo 
Well, I'm a lil' nigga don't speak 
I tote heat, here to shut down your whole operation on the street 
Bleek, you know niggas just had to recrute this 
My flow drew out like a old nigga toothless 
Who want to believe they pump Bleek with 'Renaline 
Too hyped up but weed calm my adrenaline 
Roll day on the strip, SK in the crib 
Honey crack valve playin' the binge 
Nickel nine gleam, like this armor rolled up 
My squad be armed up, gotcha niggas' arms up 
Who the fuck want what? Me and Bean's trumped up 
Witcha town underseige, dillenger in your sleave 
My gun jammed, you niggas squeeze on me 
You niggas them cats thata call these on me 
I'm on on my off game, leave the stadium for in stores 
Floss chains and I pimp whores, they smoked out 
Shirt be poked out, when the slums know eight 
Six to jump out, you eat what you spit 
Motherfucker die clean before you actin' tought cat 
But in your heart you scream, I read your body languo 
You want balance and a water mangle 
You want a challange get a broad to every angle 
This shit is slowed down, I bet that 
Ya upfront dough, in your six bet that, motherfucker 

Sassy Fox some brick money, caught me a drop 
You know how I run it, 600, glassy top 
Rock them light gray wrist shit, flash the rocks 
The red, the yellow, the green, causin' traffic stops 
Bitch, please, never freeze, gonna blast the glock 
Then I show all them to plead and breeze past the cops 
You talk slick, suck dick for money in y'all hand 
I'm like 'Bitch, I got more money than your man' 
While you get your knees scraped up, cum all over your glands 
Shit, I'm in the be Twinz ballin' them tramps

Rookie, what the fuck you know about glocks and a pop book? 
You know Na Na rock that shit, Perrot that shit 
And Scotch that shit, don't see about that shit 
Hollow points, top that shit, fuck tryin' to aim 
Pop that shit, yeah, nigga, Fox got that shit 
You see the ice wrist shit, can you cop that shit 
Shannell crocodile ostrich shit, whoa 
You know my style, I be spinnin' they calves 
And I'll show that little dick, some celebrity ass 
Get 'em a brick, I know what style to get them niggas ship brick 
Well, fuck, I let 'em live and lick the tip of my shit 
To remind 'em with some rose petals, candles, and shit 
Bust some hydro like the nigga grew up playin' my shit 
So that's what it is, why them hoes mad at my shit 
See me wildin' in the four-six, stylin' on them bum-ass 
Goddess in the sea, y'all bitches is littles Foxes 
See my girls' friends, tossin' they little watches

Born In the Vile, a nigga never ran
Seen niggaz get cut, shot, stabbed up and kidnapped
Ran over, double crossed, killed for a stack of green one's 
Now I live life, do or die, Marcy, son, evrybody trying to survive
Maintain yo strip, cokaine this shit
We ain't leavin till we drain this shit
Playin this shit, street life, but most of y'all hate Bleek right?
I'm supposed to keep heat right?
So you can haul the heat right, who really give a fuck though
I grew up amongst cut-throats, nigga, we all want dough
It's a all out thing, drugz produce cream, gunz produce human beingz 
Nigga what you think? I got one, stop one, Naw
Drop one, can't stop one, I'm here till the copz come

[Chorus]
If you got money, everybody wants some
If you got a dope flow, everybody wants some
Yo drug game is tight, everybody wants some
When a nigga get right, everybody wants some
If you got money, everybody wants some
If you got a dope flow, everybody wants some
Yo drug game is tight, everybody wants some
When a nigga get right, everybody wants some

[Verse 2]
By my area code, you know I'm able to roll
I'm a Brook-Nam nigga, we lock and load
Dodge y'all, my hungry niggaz spot y'all
Ready to bury niggaz wit 50 shots y'all
You hot god
Stop y'all, from poppin y'all lil nickels to morocan zones
I'm making somebody cripple
The strip's the issue and my dogz will siC you
While yo body bag flow, the body bag's full
I twist Kelly over backboard, ready to puish the Caddy on the curb
And smack dudes, I'm wit O.G cars, flip Oz's huh?
Don't sleep huh
I'm tryin to eat huh
Real to the heart, you real?

Shots to them traitor niggaz, and fake niggaz
Yo, muthafuckazz...

[Verse 3]
Yo Dead or alive
I'm forced to put the metal to guyz
Raise my right under oath, I ain't tellin no lies
I'm wanted alive, last nigga try to survive
Blast niggaz, you can ask niggaz how to get by
Stay rollin alive, brand choclates huh
Gunz so big, by time you see the spark, you die
Niggaz ordered a spy, won't stop till we all in the sky
Or get caught bustin down the pie
Crack a bottle for niggaz who ain't here or doin time
In the box, gettin stops, burnt blocks for dimes
All my niggaz sittin, tented wit .9mm's
Been doin or still in it wit crimes, Fuck the innocent kind

Yo I grew up like a Regular Cat
Some nigga hit me wit a signing

My gunz, my credentials, I'm geased up
Hate a nigga that don't know me and swear that Bleek front
cause I'm a little nigga, so what, I did my thang
Now I came up, fuck a nigga gon tell me?
Before this Bleek shit, a nigga couldn't eat and shit
I sold drugs, fascinated by this sneaker shit
On hot days I found ways to clock pay
Had yellow tops now my topz is gray
Cause one these lame niggaz got the color of mine
But one problem, niggaz work ain't as butter as mine
And you got to believe, yo I'm dope in the drawers form, poppy seed
And you got to be weed, I got a ounce of D and no clientele
But when the sun goes down I hit the strips for sales
Clock mel, half of my dogz ain't rottweil
We bout to work wholesale, and flip the price the retail
Wha......

I got the hood in me, so I guess I'm no good, nigga
I stay strapped Cause I know a nigga could, nigga
I chop grams in the crib wit my man
We blew L's and politiced on how to expand
We supplied the Vein
Promised to go out in a blaze
Before them pigz lock the game
We gotta maintain in this world of cold blood
It's no love, niggaz will back out heat and let you hold slugz
We took re-up money
Rollin dice, and I neva thought a game of Cee-Lo
Could take my man life, Over 3 cdnt, My son was a little bit
A nigga flash heat, he flipped and seen the end of it
A cool cat, and novody seemed to like him
Dat was my dog so nobody had to like I'm
I closed the vein down, I couldnt hustle no mo
But still I hold heat ready to ride to war
Cause I could die by this game
Spit in the Mic and my life ain't no different
Just a Regular Cat

Where the fuck niggaz know me from? (Marcy, son)
You niggaz frontin you ain't have heart to come
Besides you niggaz mad cause yo bitch ride shotty
Round town, malibu mixed wit Bicardi
She relaxed in da drop, Fendi shades matchin the watch
Accent osets, the bitch kinda prop
But her man think he untouchable
Put his ass where he ain't comfortable, Lay him up for a few
He'll realize, Bleek ain't the one to fuck wit
Provoke me to spit, consider it dealt wit
I'm not the type to hit shotz and miss you
The type to play you close to kiss you
nigga describe the pistol, you hit wit
When they fillin yo body wit liquid
Now I'm on the low cause you told em it was Memphis
Who blazed you up, yeah, laid you up

Do what you do

Check it out now
Yo I'm here to put my thing down
Set up shot with cocaine now
Pick off niggas who ain't down
I'm in the game now
Brought a couple of cats from the way down
Who know how to slang thows
And grimmy niggas who aim wild
Who juss want to rep
And wet niggas who think foul
Ran into Jay while I'm clappin this math
This crab show me some slab
Now I'm tryna get back
We played the out skerch
Nigga smoother then my shirt
Spit a couple of words, a pound, then he merked
Shit he left skid marks
I let the clip spark
When off in the hood
Played the bench till its dark
I'm profouned to the drug game
A thin line between love and hate
Some niggas I love to hate
I thought my connect respect me
This nigga got bad words since some haters wet me

Chorus 4x's
To stay alive in New York City
To stay alive realize that you got to be a soilder

Check it
Yo I'ma soldier to the heart
Through my blood line
One way to catch a crab is always on his front time
I keep a chicken on a bench flippin
Grippin
I smoke weed but this shit got a nigga slippin
A herb seed burn me, drop the L
Spot it through my per-if-you
This nigga tryna murder me
Shorty wop jumped in front of me
Caught one
Blaze back empty empty the roots
Through the bitch niggas, take that
Niggaz killed my down bitch
Bust around bitch
I don't know who clapped
So I don't hang around 
Shit
Lame beat me on the ounce of raw
Dominican nigga
Look innocent nigga
Fuck it I'ma finish this nigga
Back the coop out the lot
Cock one in the drop
Put the burner in the dash fee dipped in black
Got Bleek on alert
For the cat who beat me on the stack

Chorus 4x's
To stay alive in New York City
To stay alive realize that you got to be a soilder

Yo, Yo
Slow money, broke niggas,  no weed
One gun
And my down bitch gone
Got a nigga on the run
Strip hot
Niggas came through
Bang shots
Have me sleeping in my wheels
To the real get got
Now I play the cut
On some nigga what shit
Flip fo-in-dicals
For real now who wants it
Two blocks from the Jay's this nigga lay
He pump trays
Try'n to get the Memph man put away
His next option
Pack up get out of dodge
When he caught I'ma let the fifth give his face a massage
Too much dro got my eyes low
On the creep triple black down
'cause I'ma cripple that clown
Spotted him by WoodHall
Niggas think the fe-in took off
Like he ran track or he played football
Hot day and everybody outside
I'ma catch him on that block
Where the hot wips ride
Ride slow this nigga out burning trees
Wit a bad bitch
I'ma put his brain on her sleeve
I'ts already cocked
I move slow up the block
Jumped out
Made him tongue kiss the glock
I Squeeze two
And niggas seen this nigga drop
Cold of the street and forever stay hot

How I'm N-why deep
Who snitched to NYP (New York Police)
You bitches been dropping D's (dimes)
Since 86 striped Lees
Dial 9-1 tips
When I spit one clip
Supposed to be killing niggaz but ain't really done shit
I'm loco
Tote the 4-4
Smoke L's with duck doors
Drow flow 
Blow the smoke slow 
And holler fuck hoes
It's cash and money
Nines grab the green weed exactly
One shot lives and daiquiris
My gat be stashed in the dash
Mixed herbs and hash
On a cruise for cash
I might bruise some cats
Spit 2 at you dudes that act
Like you can't be touched
Front and lose your cap
I incinerate guns after bodies I caught son
Never on the run stack mail by the tons son

Chorus 2x:
Yo it's that Roc a Fella shit
Hoes clothes to whips
Act up and get hit 
Give a fuck who you with

Tinted my whip now

Money spend now
I move work through my pen pal
Niggaz hate bleek cause I live through this shit
You niggaz keep hating cause I could deal with this shit
I'm a street individual 
Sold it all criminal
Weed just a minimum 
I'm a M-P emblem
Rock syndicate and flips in the block
You call it I lick a shot

Went up on my caps in size

Lookin' in the face of rappers hopping I quit
Still spit the fly shit to keep them grosing my hits

Like to excersice one week say fuck it the next
Like to write four whole songs three skits a day
Talk shit with Tyrina, and do hits with J

I like to write for other people keep 'em lovin' a nigga
On the low love the dough between my publish and bigga
Is it wroth a million yet that's what they say now
Long distance California let me call J Brown

Hear the story off of a cappa who was first described
Do one for money Sauce keep thirst alive
Like the shit filled with fam when I invent that hit
Like to scream Rocafella when and repersent that shit

Just, some of things that we like to do
Pretty sure some things you like to do

Like to shop Tom D stay fresh to def

Late night I hit these hoes while their peoples asleep
I like to wake up in the afternoon religuosly
I on a vow last night fuck school Imma spend this G

I like to tell fake thugs man they soft as nerves
Like they drink infront of the heat and take off the skirt
Like when chicks try to make it seam to provoke me the hitter
Handle that diplomatic and try to fuck their sister

Like to stay away from hoes I heard caught a diesease
Like to do shows then hit bums off of some cheese
Everything I spit blaze now us in this week
Now I like to grab my dick and say Bitch I'm Memphis Bleek

[Chorus]

[Memphis Bleek](Sauce Money)
I like to ride shotgun, roll my dro' in the coop
Like to go gold with you and hold my guns on the stoop
Like to shoot whack rappers and get away with the crime
Like to bag shorties tried to fuck me two at a time
Like to see that bitch nigga who alarmin the cops
Only reason I pull heat infront of his mom and pops
(I neva liked that)but if he want to front on me imma strike back
Niggas can neva front on bleek

Go to parties take my shirt off and I'm rockin' my vest
I like to come through and drink Bacardi Dark in the lex
After that, Smoke weed in the park when it's wet

Come on stupid, I clap up from your hood to the trunk
Foot on the floor, back on the wall, good with the pump
Blast through your stomach, stupid, you can look through your lunch

Runnin the streets, lawless, blastin police
Stickin Furby's out the window, snatchin your niece
And nah, we don't just rap we clap you past the seats

Me with the twin eagle, B. Sigel and Bleek
And I got the whole city ready to throw toast wit' me
I'm loved, niggas want to throw slugs with Jigga
All they, need is a reason to show love for Jigga

Niggas want to go back to back, till both of our gats clack
Till we reload in three seconds flat, I'm back
Niggas ain't met ya hat till we entered through ya shoulder
And we exit out ya back, gangsta nigga

Send 'em to one of my custy's and bring a lung back

Smoke one to the head, come between my stomach and leg

Check it out, yo

Aiyo, this time it's for my family, we ride or die
It's in the blood 'til the death, now aim for the sky
My four blow fo show, fo doe, for only
It's money, drugs and hot slugs you know bleek

Squeeze hammers t'il they nail me, fuck what niggas tell me
Street scholar, keep firin' is what they tell me
Drug chemist, thug nigga be named Memphis
Straight from da borough of dem B.K. niggas

Where we rob for the fun of it, hustle for the drug of it
Rap money in rubber-bands, just for the love of it
Straight from my ghetto, we listen to heavy metal like
Desert eagles, street sweepers, loud metal

It's hit an run now, motherfuck anyone of you
We dem niggas be in ya crib just like furniture
Pop up with the gun in ya
Release one for zero-zero M Bleek R O C dot com

This philly cat back at it
Still throwin' crack at it
Still fuckin' with them crack-atics
Still bust 'em with them black matics

It's ain't the bucks, it's the rush
You tryin' to get my ass at it
They say I think ass backwards
Fuck how I act, as long as I stack, it's all mathematics

Our tracks nice, hug the block ta tract dice
Late night, club night, mac attract dikes
I pull up, Cadillac truck nice
Two guns, you know mac pack gat twice

Gets that crack back wit that ice
No joke wit the coke, I wips that right
No doubt, never droubt, gets that price
It gets that nice, when you live that live

Papi knows yours name
And you ditched that wife
Nigga it's gets stacked green nigga
It gets stacked chain nigga

I get forty G's a feature now
Hold Franklin's like a Aretha now
In the SL two seater now
And I'm in nuthin' but diamonds

I'm the illest female that you heard thus far
Five-five with the thirty-four B-cup bra
I fuck wit dem cats who ain't up to par
I get niggas for cash, clothes, jeweleries, plus cars

I'm talkin' rent money, I'm talkin' bank money
I'm talkin' Martha Keats step of with the rent money
Movin' on up, two in the sauna
Still ride through the block, pull up on the corna, plus

Give me an inch so I can take a mile

The, the roc, the the, the roc
(Let me talk to y'all niggas real quick)
The, the roc, uh uh, the roc

Yo, y'all niggas truly ain't ready for this dynasty thing
Y'all thinkin' Blake Carrington, I'm thinkin' more like ""ming
I got four nephews, and they all right in
They all young and wild, plus they all like things

And I'm havin' a child, which is more frighting
But y'all about to witness is big business kid
Big bosses, cocky, and big benzsesses
Come through flossin'em shiny rims it is

An office don't pop up in their sentences
I think you understand what type of event this is
I don't think you know I focus young Memphis is
Or I see was so real, when you add on Amil

This is much more than rap, it's black entrepreneur
Clothin', movie, and films, we come to conquer it all
Roc-A-Wear, eighty mill like, eighteen months
You could bullshit wit rap if you want, muthafuckers
When it's all said and done, we gon' see what's what
Holla at Hov, I'll be in the cut what

Ay yo I got a resolution
This year I'm playing right
No six fifteen this year
You can stay the night
We can go bowling it ain't like before
Can't y'all see that I'm growing?
I was so immature
I was young and having money
Having honeys come to the crib
Thinkin' they shit and they couldn't get cab money from me
Some bad chicks didn't get pass the bridge
I went to One Trump Plaza on their asses'
No room service just snacks and shit
Work with those Lil' Debbies and when your done get ready
The chicks I was fiendin' to smash
Let 'em lean on the cash
Will take 'em on long trips
Break 'em with long dick
There was no such thing as strong relationships
But I'm off that playa shit
I need a chick that practice top cheese
That still can by weed
And can give me some good head
And I'll make her remind me, uh-huh

Can I feel up on your wood and grill?
It's a hood thing, wood grain, off the chain
She give me good brain
Love the way I push my slang
Callin' my jack soon as the hop in my V
They catching contact, weed smoke all up in the weave
Bet'cha man can't do it like this, like this
I bet his wrists ain't bluish like this, like this
And I'm from Marcy you catch me on anybody's block

I was the worse
I used to switch chicks every day
Had niggas mad for real like ""I wish he was gay""
Cause they knew sooner or later hun was gettin' with Jay
Just a matter of time she was gettin' with Jay
I'll have your chick in the summer tropics sippin' on 'zae
Spittin' up in the Pacifics smoking spliffs in the shade
She used to love ya, but she feeling different today
You used to smother her, look at your honey slippin' away
Consorting with hustlers, niggas that be giving her space
She said she feel free when she's around me
I'm letting her do her and in turn she's doing me
She on the phone with her friends like how cool is she

Memphis Bleek,"Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
Say, ""Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
But I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
Cause most niggaz don't know a brick from a bike
They keep buyin hard white
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
FYI, I never been robbed in my life""
Or, you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
Let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
Then, before they look up you sellin the town cook-up
Or, gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them
Still there Brooklyn?

Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'ma roll with that one

Make out a check for eight hundred dollars
Jigga Man, holla 

1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy
Whassup Sig?  This Chris out the Young Guns dog
Whattup?
I'm ready to smash these niggaz in the rap game
The niggaz takin too long with that advance money and shit
Yeah
Talkin 'bout chill, chill don't pay the bills
Yeah I feel that
I know you well connected dog
Let me holla at somebody real
Aight look, I got the perfect person for you, hold on
Bleek, line two

Listen shorty, you wanna roll just give me the word
I ain't got time for a sentence all that shit is absurd
You find a strip first, if you don't cook find a bitch first
If you don't hustle find a nigga who pitch first
You new in town, no red and blue in town, there's gangs
Don't get fresh, let 'em know you small change
The strong move quiet, the weak start riots
We know you got a brick but sell 'em twenties til they tired
With no credit, you know you sick with that gotta eat fetish
And other niggaz who gettin it, dead it
Make 'em an offer that they can't refuse
He resists, box him in, til he can't be moved
Here's the rules: chop it, bag it, stash it, stack it
Get in, get out, that's a O.G.'s classic
900-Hustler, you pass it around
Wanna speak to me direct, hit extension trey-pound, I'm out

1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your dog
What seem to be the problem young boy?
Yo whattup, this Murder Def Kill Homicide Nigga
I got two freaks
Yo watch your fuckin mouth man
Fuck you mean watch my mouth nigga?
Been on hold for about two hours nigga
I don't give a fuck how long you been on the line
Shut the fuck up!  Matter of fact, hold on
I know this nigga ain't just put, put me on hold man
This bullshit-ass elevator music
Free, pick up line five

First things first, watch what you say out your mouth
When you talkin on the phone to hus-tlers
Never play the house, think drought, keep heat in the couch
When you sittin in the presence of cus-tomers
Never hold out, pull out, throw heat and be out
If a nigga ever think that he touchin-ya
Lay low, get cake, whip all over the state
Stash dough, whip yay with, right amount of bake (hoe!)
Nigga too close went right around his place (yo!)
You stoppin dough when we clutchin the gats?
I know you heard ""Friend or Foe,"" this ain't different from that
Make sure you got your four-four and he can slip if he like
Young, Jon Benet daughter missin tonight and yo
Until you up stay away from them dykes and whores
Three smuts, two straights and a dyke
Can pause one-three rumbles two streaks and a pipe for sure
And if it's tight, then he might come back for more
Nine and four, everyday back and forth
Winter to summer, 1-900-Hustler
Pass the number til you're stackin balls
Tell you how to weigh shit wet and package more
I take cash or write the check out to F-R
Two E's, that'll be two G's
And forget my money I'm comin for all your ki's, nigga

I'm raised off one rule, never get caught slippin' 

That's why I eat, sleep, s*** with my gat 
Bag up, take a piss, f*** a b**** with my gat

Let alone, no award, from rap to win 
Talk drama, get yourself wrapped up in 
Severe head trauma, get beat with the nine lime-a 
Cut your hand off if you f***in' with my product 

That slayed s***, I'm on the grave shift 
We all know f***ed up money don't pay rent 
You short with my ones, you short one thumb 
You can't, come up short where the f*** I'm from 

We got, dues to pay, new tools to spray 
Who's to say, Bleek won't make news today 
You know the ooze'll spray if you refuse to pay 
And I move the yeah n**** day by day

Memphis Bleek,"Yea, it's that knock right here
You fuck around not have the right speakers in your system
Your shit be soundin' like this 

Big thangs, thick chains, ain't shit changed
Get brain in the four-dot-six Range
Shit mayn, switch lanes
Every town I hit you switch lames, bitch flip big 'caine

I giving 'em whiplash when I'm whippin' the whip fast
Which one?  Pick one nigga, I got a six stashed
Continental T's, no tense like I got a thick stab
Big cigar, old money, when I drop it it's so funny
Six-four switches, slam doors on 6's
Big trucks when I wanna fuck and it's time to get ass
I turn automobiles to hotels on wheels
I got money for a room it's just the fact that I'm trill
Bitches love when I cruise up the boulevard
They have contests to guess which car I'ma pull out the yard
They know I, come for dolo and pull off with a broad
Spin away, spend a day tryin' to pull menage
Just mackin' this gorgeous sunlight hit the ice it's flawless
Run lights like I'm the king of New York, I'm lawless
Bitches, they wanna hang like plaques in the office
Cause I push black Porsches, Benz's and Jaguars-es
When the rag's off it, gat on my lap, I'm that cautious
Never trust grimy-ass New Yorkers
'Specially when you're sittin' on 20's they get nauseous
Standin' in the Azure with white Air Forces

You can catch me in the parkin' lot
Hollerin' at bitches, parkin' lot pimpin'
Everyday we be off the chains
Workin' with grain, sittin' on them thangs
Tryin' to find out where dem dollars at (dollars at)
So when I holla at you, holla back (holla back)
Everyday we be off the chains
Ain't nuttin' different, parkin' lot pimpin'

You can catch Mac in the parkin' lot, pimpin' crazy
S-5, Navy 'Cedes, sittin' on 80
That's four dubs, not S-4 dub
Stash box, push Hot Wheel like Matchbox
Bitches wanna push my world, they flash box
160, push my wheel, mash cops
Cause 160 took my wheel to cash drop
Run 60, you Big Will, match cop
Lookin' through the rearview and Mac was wylin'
New driver, screwdriver, the cracked steering column
Pushin' somethin' stolen, blastin', picture me rollin'
Baghdad, couldn't picture me rollin'
Now the truth different, Mac come through Coupe roof missin'
I'm the truth til my fuckin' roof missin'
Mac stay stuck in the Coupe to school pigeons
Feathers gettin' plucked in the truck from loose chickens, listen

You can catch me in the parkin' lot

Yo, aiyyo I dip dip dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside the Escalade
So I called up, murder to further my parkin' lot pimpin'
Told 'em get the Impala so I can start dippin'
Lay back, seat recline, they notice the hand
Car movin' slow, driven by the invisible man
Everything on the dash, digital and
I got a fast stashbox don't make me spit at you man
In the parkin' lot, where I spark a lot
I come to show my new feet, slide off with a few freaks

White tees and fitted's, backwoods and spinage

I smoke silver and strawberry
Easy ball like Maurberry you know I'm not the ordinary
I keep one that keep one
Yeah my b**** bag b****es too, we the illest crew
Nothing change but the rims upgrade
It's quarters now ma, and I'm on it now
So hop in, I pull off like toupes
And the only thing I rock on my hip that's two ways
My b****, my beeper, Bleek keep two heaters
Still peeling the city with two seaters
And you know how I does it while I'm doing it
Black couping it b****, I keep two in it

The game all mad cause I'm back with my tool like that
I'm in that big body truck
That I whip through the sky like I don't give a f***
Got trucks with drivers, cars low mileage
Just copped it, I drove it and parked it
Truthfully that's my Sunday wheel
And your wife, real nice, she my Sunday feel n****!

Niggas forget niggas as soon as your coffee off in the ground
Family man, look at your kids orphans now
Used to just smack rappers
I'm extorting them now
Taking all that's important to them now down to your bitch
Nigga you sick fronting like you tougher than what you are
Till the gun is coming through the drivers side of your car
Using my name in vein like I won't damage the boy
You think niggas was shooting you out of canons before (I'm that nigga)
Niggas is pompous, first they in Evil Kanevil jumpers
Than they turning over Rovers like they want it with Hovah
It's not about rich and po', nigga, it's about Richard Poe
Understand I'm here to get this dough
It ain't about Brooklyn or Harlem
No more them it's about fame or stardom
It's about me being on blocks you borrowed from

Gripping a bag tight while y'all living a mad life
I chase down niggas, shake down niggas
Head back to the honeycomb to break down figures
I love 38's but the trey pounds bigger
Throw in the bank, trucks the size of tanks now nigga

Petite nice body, skin and face sick
One I could shop with
Go uptown and cop with
She not a thug girl but my down chick
She know how to roll the weed but don?t smoke
She know how to cook the coke and bag dope
Screen my calls
Flip on me when im wrong
Talk shit thru the night
Throw it on me on the morning
She like it from the back
With my fingers in her hair
I love it in any position
Ma I don?t care
She like when I shine up them jewels that blind her
And drive by the projects while a nigger hollar

I let her drive the V

Bitches wanna hollar now
She back out the step
When yo niggers crowd around
That's my road dog
And you know I unload for her
She hold me down anytime I call for her
Like at the time when I crashed the Jag
She brought the Yukon 2000 black
Through a screen and a DVD
Twenites on the truck that'll piss you off
In return I sent her on a tour thru Sacks
With tengrand shoping spree to get back
I brought her a five that look nice when she drive
Put a glock on the dash
Watch the stash nigga

Hold my 380 baby

Don't even wipe your mouth, get up, be out!
Don't let the cars fool you, or the jewelry blind you

This for them broads that'll hold me down
And my niggas on the Internet that download my style
And my dog in line in at chow
Just bangin with his walkman playin me loud
And the nigga with that plate
Choppin them grams, him and his man
Listening to music that they understand
And that white boy goin to college
He don't know about the ghetto but know how to hold metal
Them white boys, they'll shoot shit up
They can listen to this shit, I don't give two fucks
But back to it, sippin on that Cognac fluid

Playa lectures got me shining like a new Gator stepper
Must have been mad
When your ho put my stuff in the dash
Bust in her ass
To climax I come up with a nab
The game don't stop
Legit ballers bending up the block
Niggas rushing, coming at us cause of status and props
Sucking and fucking, loving it when I put tha dick up inside her
Can't help it if she yellin' with a ridah

There's no respect at all
You betta check her dawg
She keep beggin' me to hit it raw
So she can have my kids and say it was yours
How foul is she? And you wifed her
Shit, I put the rubber on tighter
Sent her home, when she entered home
You hugged her up
What the fuck is up?
She got you whipped, got your kids
Got your home, but that's not your bitch
You share that girl, don't let 'em hear daddy Earl
It'll make 'em sick that his favorite chick

Bought a new five, maybe a six

And you know how it go when it come to the hoes
She can do the same thing to the clique you know
Your hoe chose, don't get mad at me
Got your wife callin' me daddy
Put her out on the street let her get that cheese

You betta keep her away from my balling clique
Keep her out of nightclubs all in the mix

Not that help - that life situation get short
Gettin with ma, Bleek still gettin her high
End up, gettin her somethin she ain't get in her life

This as easy as it get, better than baggin up dope
Rule one you need a gun, and a box of shells
Ski-mask recommended unless you ready for jail
Keep a knife, in case he get hero and grab the gun
And while you tusslin, use the knife to puncture a lung
Rule two, and every killer knows this one
You throw the drop on a thug better check him for his gun
Cause we all hold heat, we all don't sleep
We all know rule three, you play, play to keep
Rule four - a team ain't necessary but it helps

Get on the floor, clap a second time
And make sure I flat-line you
Let a whole round go, hit niggas behind you

Get shot, popped, and drop, yo the team is the Roc

I'm puttin heads to beads, gun straight out the box
B-Sige, I put up all the roofs and glocks
I'm not playin, see these guns that I'm sprayin?
Twin sub oozies, can't budge or move me
Nickels stay chubby, smokers never choosy
Don't gotta yell up the block, they come to me
Packs with colorful tops just like coochies
New jacks with they pack they like, who he?
I'm not playin, knock them things off quick
Got game still think off shit
What you say?

[Bleek]
With a partner like Sigel, don't come a dime a dozen
We could be brothers, we better known as cousins
As we climbed the chart with who the fuck want what
My hood to your hood, we showed the world crew love
Who want to play with that Roc-A-team?
Know that I tote that thing that knock sixteen
You walk around talkin' this and that
How I sound like Jay and all my records is wack
But when I dropped the LP, niggas thought it would fold
Thirty days later, Coming of Age went gold

No knock knock, who's that? who's there? or who is it?

Something to hold on to, for the rest of my life
And I can show you what it's like to be in Trini for a night 'cause (I want to love you)
It's been a long way here, from plan to hallway
To bring us all way here
To the sweets in L.A. or beach M-i-a or chill out pool
Shout out to crib where I lay 'cause I (love you)
And everyday that pass we gotta live it to it's limit like we live in our last
And we been broke before

Wit' this love I never felt before now why

You let em know everyday of your life is, check it

Look what I done to them, they want run wit 'em
I let 'em stay few nights but then I'm done wit 'em
Mami you rollin, get your clothin
You know one sight of the mansion will get 'em open
I back out my garage wit, new Ferrari
Cause I been pimpin this game since Atari
You hardly, ever see me loving a hoe
I tell a bitch, I'm in love wit my doe
Cause I'm pimping and, niggas is bitchin and
We was the pharmacy now you want prescriptions
Think I'm slippin, like I don't grip again

You see I'm vest up, I'm ballin at war
These niggas wanna see me off, they don't wanna see me on but
Proof I'm ballin; I put a eighth
Of that white down in my hood, I can finish it by the mornin
Re-up by noon, re-kick at night
Half these dudes doing bids couldn't live my life
And you youngn's in the hood wanna be like P
Cause every new gat I cop it begin wit a P
Like, P-89 you niggas' P-92 shit
You know how dudes ""This Proof ain't for that bullshit""
And these hoes wanna roll wit a G
But once I hit 'em wit that G, I have totin the P, cause!

[Verse 3 - Memphis Bleek]
Yo I hear 'em callin, and every city I travel
Hoes get at 'em when they see a nigga ballin
Keep the steel wit me, couple of killas from the hood
Who blew bail, but still they keep it real wit me
We ride out (and?) we find out (where?)
Your little address (and?) blow out your hideout (yeah)
Who want war? hoes they tellin me ""E's you ain't right""
Like this year I'm gon go South Pole
This for them haters think I'm slippin, I ain't
When I find 'em hiding I tie 'em, they be missin like weight
But wait, lil nigga don't be missin my point
I don't miss when I point, niggas get killed off point
And you see, I school a little you, forfeit the game
I was young, just like 'em, Jay taught me the same
But I see he hard headed, told em stay in his lane
Cause them OG's home and they layin wit K's cause

If I have to live my life all over, nope, oh, baby, yeah
I do it all again
(Yo everyday)
If I have to live my life all over
(Every hour you know, yeah)

Yo, yo, same hustle man, same struggle man
Yeah, I do it again, if I have to
Still the same way, still the game paid
Still the young nigga, still slang, yeah

I wouldn't change a thing and my mama did it all by herself
She sayin' the same pray, listen
You hear when she whisper
I get the chance I fix her, days that I slipped her

And my man the past, I tell him I love him
And I hug him before he pass
Raised his daughter as if she was mine
Still meet the same girl, still have mine, uh

I thank God the Melik meet Shawn
I throw the diamond up higher in every song
And only drama could do it again
Da hood don't love me, still I walk through it again hear me

I wouldn't change one fact if I have to come back
And I couldn't live black, got me
But mama love me, I'm from da ghetto
And only God could judge me

I would do it all again, I would do it all again
If I have to live my life all over, oh baby, yeah
I do it all again
(Aha, uh, yeah, what)
I do it all again, if I have to live my life all over
(I do it over, for real, same way)

Oh, I wouldn't change a thang, same shit the basic
Same house, same spouse, same pop's I came with
Same gun, same case, same niggaz I bang with
I be big right now before I change shit

Just roll me up an L and live life and just do what I do
It's all lovely when it's right
But when it's wrong, I just play along
Get hit bounce back like it's really nothin' wrong

And I still struggle, still bubble
No matter if I'm broke or rich I still hustle
Still get niggaz to test you is my life
And I do it all again,I do it twice

And I won't change a thang, maybe two
I bring Big and Pop back put them in the same room
Then I apolotic and make peace in da same room
Once a game dead then you know we all dead too, true

And then we back on the block
With the crack in da sack
I take it how it come from the bottom to the top
I signed wit Bleek and I'm ridin' wit The Roc and I

Would do it all again, do it all again
If I have to live my life all over, oh baby, yeah
I do it all again, for the love as it gain
If I have to live my life all over
(And I do it again, yeah, holla)
Oh, I would

Yo, I talk to my fam I lost and let them know
How I feel from my heart without them here no mo'
And is no lies, I do it all again from the start of my life
Till the night my mama die

I would it told her, I love and it all kept looses and close
Let her know I always be here for you
Apologize to grandma that for da stress I put her through
And to my dad I ain't mad at you

Even thought you wasn't there without you
I won't be here so I gotta be fair
Still don't love lost over here I swear
To my restin' road dawgz, yeah
(I do it all again)

Why changin' my resurrection
I be back and the style same strip
Back with the same click
Hustle in the game chips, explain this
If I have to live all over I do it
Let Barbara have his kidz all over watch me

Get it quick, servin' the pump liquor
Spend a little mo' time with my big brother Leek
Still be fam with Cease, Proof, Cali and Bleek
Holla and get low, probably when my life repeat, nigga

I would do it all again
If I have to live my life all over, oh, baby, yeah

If I have to live my life all over, oh I would

Get Low in the building, why'know, nigga
Let's do it, c'mon, yo

[Memphis Bleek]
It's gettin hot so the shorts is on
Gotta tote the snub it's too warm for the long, nigga
You could pass me to baby's zoo
One shot'll turn a nigga face into baby food; BLAAH!
Get it clear, now why they lookin for Saddam
Weapons of mass destruction is here
I got a few in my hood
In case a nigga ever get the feelin and he think that he could
Or would, pull sket on me
I could show you first hand what's a felony
And a hobby and the process of gettin money is nothing
I'm not Sosa, but the dogs is coming
This is not not, no, no, motherfucking game
Entertain you motherfuckers is not why I came
It's R.O.C. and M.O.P.
I wipe floors wit little niggas for fuckin wit my team

[Fame]
My nigga think so god that ounce and mo ice and the nicest MC
But yo big, tell god I said naah, 'cause he throw like a bitch
When he threw it he missed, the niceset MCs is right here
Why the fuck you throw it over there
The whole rap game turned into a 2-Pac-a-don
Gangsta boy boppin, with his nuts and cock in your palm
Playa pass the baton, got a few jack tools and bullet scars
Now you got your 2-Pac costume on (THUG LIFE!!)
First of all, y'all niggas gon' need more songs
This M.O.P. nigga we put it down (put it down!!)
Motherfuckers trying to figure me out
Wanna see what a nigga be bout
But if I told ya, I predicted the death of my oldest brother was last
And the death of my mother you'd probably think I'm crazy as fuck
Rumor has it that I' m half past the seventh hour
Naw nigga I'm a quarter to eight, M.O.P.!

[Billy Danze]
Now let me clear this up for you youngun, Bill still comin
The Ville still gunnnin (St- tuh tuh tuh tuh tuh!!!)
Runnin I come from the Browns where niggas don't play fair
It's no love lost 'cause it was never none there
Put me in a position to blast
I'll pop you and drop you, where they be fishin for bass
So once you ramblin, take you, drape you, and break you to small pieces
And FedEx your fingers to one of your nieces
We hold fort, we don't give a fuck about you
Ask them bouncers we'll stomp the shit out you
Bill's, not concerned wit a turn and it's the shine
'cause every step along the line I'ma take mine, nigga
In '87, I started my career
I'll jump back, (clap!) and get it goin this year

Memphis Bleek,"(Beanie Sigel)
Roll a ""L"" and burn a incent
It's like magic when I invent
This shit that I present
Yo turn my levels up a izinch
And drop the trebble down the pizinch
And let the bass commence
To relax your nerves
It's like a paintin with no color it's-why I attach the words
My mind the brush, my life the canvas, the world, the easel
Combines a perfect picture for people
My words is colorful like autumn
The way they fall on the track like leaves when I record em'
There's nothin like it when I write
And I don't print, I invent it and predict it like a psychic
Pull down the shades on the windows of your soul
And gaze into your mind and watch the wisdom unfold
I was taught when your vision's impaired
The wisdom is there
A message from Big Homey couldn't-have sent it no clear
I know the flow is like hypnotic
And tightest tip when I drop it with no particular topic
Type shit that can't be bitten so stop it
Type shit that can't be re-written on copy
By kinko, kodak, fuji films
Kin-folk know that groovy hymns
Spit by him'll put the gospel to you
Catch some little higher learning from a sermon once I drop it to you
Hypnotic...hypnotic...
My flow is like hypnotic...
The flow is like hypnotic...
My flow is like hypnotic...
(Memphis Bleek)
So roll a ""L"" and light a incent
It's like magic when I event
This shit that I present
It's not a secret when I speak it
I know that hatin' isn't physical but dawg I could peep it
It's like a preacher preachin' his scripts or psychic readin' a palm
Lines give me what I write in-this song
The book is now open so let the story be told
I enter through your mind and exit the back of your soul
That could push you to some insight
A shine like a headlight
Pickeny diamond watch me get right
I'm that nice
Words is a cure that help me heal up a heart
Words can become that evil game that help me get what I want..uh
You start where you end, you end where you start
I am the light of the situation I overshine dark
Give you the pen, the book, the word, the truth, the sight, the mind
I put it down, you call it a rhyme, I call it a sign
I predict the unpredictable
Heaven is invisible, but hell isn't physical
Let me stop with the spiritual.. whoa
Let me spit at you, show you how to move with no vehicle
Come through your speakers
Into/enter your ear, end up in paragraphs
Tellin' your man of what you hear
'cause, spit it I often roll it tighter than chronic
Styles versatile meanwhile it's hypnotic
Hypnotic...hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
(Jay-Z)
Pass the dutchie if you was ill
Take one to the grizzill
Tell me what you fizzill
It's like a complicated puzzle unravelin', mind travelin', with no particular flight patterin
Speak the language of the lizand
Desert feeds worm, worm feeds falcon, falcon feeds man ..uh
Only the strong survive, so if you along for the ride strap your boots and leave your thongs inside..uh
We experience turbulence in urban environments daily, rarely it's aqcuired
We riot like Israelis
Why am I here that question overwhelms me
I am a gangsta, Dr. Melfi couldn't help me
I am a thinker, my mind fixes all that L's/ills me the perfect elixir
I trust mines will never fail me
I let my speech unfold, I reach deep inside the seed of my soul and I got it
Hypnotic...hypnotic....

My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...

[Memphis Bleek talking]
Yeah...I mean, M.A.D.E, no mob shit
Money, Attitude, Direction, and Education...some real
shit
Think about my hood one time, my hood...it's trippin'
Thinkin I've changed, crossed niggaz
Where we go wrong

[Verse 1]
I'm from that two-bedroom apartment, Marcy
5-3-4, that middle building...yeah, they say it started me
I'm new to it but consider me young
Seen it all happen, ain't understand what was done
But, all I wanted was the fly kicks fly shit
Little nigga but still kept a fly bitch
And back then it was love in the hood
Knuckle up with ya dog and fuck it, it's all good
Now, I'm in the crib rippin up to go to war with 'em
Same little niggaz I used to steal from the store with 'em
I go and get 'em from school
Used to take the same bus, same train back then we was cool
I broke bread at lunch with 'em
And if mom's left me with two singles, then you know
I'm splittin one with 'em
We cut school in the building I lived in, one floor higher
Smokin and gettin higher
Damn, think of age, now we locked up north
It was like yesterday we was practicin sports
Went from flippin on mats now he flippin in the box
Locked twenty-three hours up a day, he in the max
ain't no lookin back because this life goes on
We was kids didn't care about the rights and wrongs
But, nobody judged us the ghetto loved us
Streets, the only thing that ever took something from us
I lost a couple friends
But I promised and prayed that if I make it, I'm'a see 'em again
I admit, I was wild as a child
And my mom's ain't like none of my friends who use to call me Ismhael
My brother stayed on punishment, mama found out he hustle and
Found couple jacks, her plan she thought of flushin it
Me, I'm in the streets I swore, never change
My brother caught a cause, I came up to do the same

[Hook - Latif singing] (2X)
It's all about my days, this is all about my nights
This is all about my pain, this is all about my life

[Verse 2]
I got my first work, about the age of fourteen
My brother fighting a case his bail was fourteen
Me, still hustlin, school not going
My clothes started changin, the money started showin
My right hand was owing every hoe we know
She represent us through the ghetto every hood we know
He put me on on that traffic, though the money was average
I ain't care I learned how to handle that package
Then, a body dropped, O locked for minute
The squad it never died, I was left to represent it
Took a nigga out his crib his name I ain't gon' mention it
Know this hit home, I know this nigga listenin
Cause we was tighter than brothers where did the love go
I called your mother my mom's dog, I let the love show
This was supposed to be us
You was supposed to have the next verse dog, this was supposed to be us
And, you know I taught you the streets, taught you to pitch in
I gave you that gear got you all the bitches
I never thought you ever cross me dog
If they back me down in the corner, get 'em off me dog
Now I see exactly where we went wrong
When I spin through the hood and I see him, I keep it goin
Now the ghetto lookin at me like I changed
But, I'm still that regular nigga I'm still the same

Brawls and ballin, ain't all that's goin on round here
Young killers tote pistols, like they grown down here
Them young niggaz similar to King Kong, round here
A pocket full of stones, would get you on down here
So dope boy, keep ya drops like the song round here
Hey it ain't safe for the faker walkin home round here
Hey, the hell what we know if you ain't know round here
You say the wrong thang, will get ya back blown round here
The gangsta's rep they hood, by the zone round here
Get a hole in ya dome, bout ya rims down here
24's make them dubs, look like 10 down here
I'm where it is, and the biz is for us rappers round here

But most girl, disrespectful when they try to speak, as if
They don't understand, Let me live, Ma

Try to be nice about being disrespectful

Yo
I take it back home every chance I get
Because I've been through every ghetto, but home I can't forget
Wish I could take em all, on this ride with me
But it won't be real, and if you asked it ain't be reality
I only fucked with a few, and If you real you know
Soon you go, but if not, you don't yeah.
We still family right, that's what you leave me to believe
But ya don't understand my life
I took Dre down to South Beach, just to show him what A few ones to do
When you amongst your crew, we living
I never picture I could ever loose him
But I found myself with the thoughts that I'ma loose him
I put the stash up, I'm just trying to save his life
Just moved moms, had to moved her twice... down to Miami
I thank God everyday of my life, that I could provide for my family

I kept my moms away, to let her enjoy life
I wish I could do the same, but I can't theirs work to do
Rent due, there's more work to do
I copped bikes let my niggas ride them
I copped coupes, let my niggas drive them
I'm proud to see my niggas wilding, cause I remember them days
They still vivid of me, huggin' the block, young soul committed
When I wrote rhymes daily
To get my flow up pray one day They whole world could hear me
I love it when the crowd recited every word of it
When they bounce, Let me know that they all a part of it
That two things make me proud of my life
I thought I had it all, but the best give was life
The third ?? I'm a brand new father
Of a Healthy baby boy and its making me work harder

Yeah that bounce we need, ya know
Marcy where we at huh? Right here
Let me hear some new shit, yeah niggaz
Just Blaze you a muhfucker wit these beats boy
Let me hold it down though, yo

[Verse]
Let the hood know, that Bleek ain't changed
Anywhere in the world, I don't tuck the chain
And I walk like, yeah I need the 'cane/caine
But dawg that's the shotty, trust me I ain't playing
War, I'm ready for it to go there
Anybody that know me know I love when it go there
Dawg, and yeah that's wassup
Four dimes, all mine nigga that's wassup
Yeah, wifey want to curse me out
You won't get me cause the chain's like it's workin out
But E's - still wit the Roc-A-Fella gang hoe
Whole crew got cheese like mozzarella mayne
Top come off, top stay on, whatever
Got rid of the five I don't like the leathers niggas!
Six is better, more room and there's more wood to cover my interior

[Chorus - repeat 2x]
This is war! Enough of them words we wan't war!
You throw a couple of shots, we throw more!
You gettin that money, we got more!
We got more nigga, this is war!

[Verse]
I warned her, man should not fear man
If you violate man then you die by hand
And it should be fine, behanded that man
That man I am and you don't understand
But I hear the talking like ""Bleek where you been?""
It's unfortunate I'm in beef again huh
Niggaz is rappin and clappin I'm still laughin
Sat back in my hood and tried to live average
But - you still want me to bang at em
Stack lil paper, send a lil gang at em
But I see you want to stop my chill
Trips to oddy earth, meetings wit McNeil
Or - round table meeting wit Hov
You want me in the hood still over that stove
Nigga, I got soldiers in Droves
It ain't nothing to a boss we'll go in your clothes nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse]
This is - not for children, not for lames
Only for real niggaz that can feel what I'm saying
If it's - too blatant then it's not for you
You do a hit, throw up later, it's not for you
So - just quit you bitch, making me sick
You never pimped you only friendly wit chicks and
I've been away for a minute
Jay beat up the drum now they whinin like women
I'm right back nicca, where you at nicca?
Keep the mac nigga, spit it like that nigga
And I tried to chill, even though
I got to spit everyday like I ain't signed a deal nigga!
Mama's still in the hood, work steel in defense
I got a flow like I'm still on the bench nigga
Got a delivery like Sunday's paper
I lay that down and I get that paper nigga!

They tell me that temptation, oh, is very hard to resist
You tell me that you want me, i tried to hide my feelings, d-o-gs
Ain't supposed to feel like this
You can call it what you want to, but I don't even know what it is
You've got me singing in the morning, you bring me breakfast in my bed
And when it hurts you rub my head
Ill ask you one time only, baby, wont you be there when its hectic
When I don't have a hit record (never leave me alone)

[Chorus]

[Nate Dogg]
Ive traveled so many places, I've seen so many faces
There were times I didn't think Id make it through (alone)
I went through so many phases, that got me so many cases
Three strikes you're gonna then what you gonna do
I guess Ill call my lady, and tell her to kiss my baby
They tell me that crime is all I know how to do
Tell him his daddy's sorry, let him know all about me
There's one more thing Id really like for you to do

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Somebody was naughty when they snitched on me
A'm mobbing through the county mainline
Back in 9500 just trying to handle mine
Spitting game at the homies about the good ol days
As we try to pass time waiting for the chain to chino
I see no reason to cry but I miss my baby boo
And my nigga spanky too
Its true that the dirt I did from an o.g. to a snotty nose kid
Got me caught up in the rapture like maze days gone by
And real gs gon cry
But I try to walk the yard with my head to the sky
And hope my baby boo ain't fucking niggas on the outside
But whats the chance it ain't cracking
If I was out and she was in Id probably be macking
I cant lie
So I say I would now my girl in a world of player hood
A player should show a nigga love and look our
But the niggas I know would probably turn your ass out
So keep away better yet stay away
And hope I get out one day, OK
But if I don't I guess this is home
My girl is tripping she got a block on the phone

Memphis Bleek,"I said there's no such thing as the straight path
My brother got hit the other day by straight blasts
In the brain, on the train, on his way to work
A guy that spent most of his life dealin' with dirt

But as soon as he decides to get a 9 to 5
Why would God decide to take his life?
There's no such thing as the straight path

So it's whatever with me, I walk through the mind
Feel whatever could hit me
My mind filled with anger hope the angels is with me
Change could be dangerous

Goin' legit could be signing your death certificate
Calling it quits could be the worst thing you do
I mean consider your enemy
He ain't gonna quit 'coz you quit now, is he?
Think about it

So what's on infinitely with me
I'm gonna turn to finity for the tough times I pour Hennessey
In memory of that one thing that meant one thing to me
I'm on, somethin' in me wishin' I wan't born

Come on, a gangsta say quttin' the game
Man, you lookin' at a dead man talkin'
He's always a brother or cousin to somebody you fought
Who might forgive but that don't happen too often

I said there's no such thing as the straight path

In the brain, on the train, on his way to work

I said there's no such thing as the straight path
I said there's no such thing as the straight path

When the gun burn everythin'
You been taught you must unlearn
With one turn of the world, one fatal stroke I'd have lost all hope now I'm goin' for broke

So my new motto is smoke clear, kiss smoke
When you lose everything you love it's time to grip the snob
The time for talking is done, listen for one
If you got that weight on you I'll be liftin' you up
Hope you got that aid on you, I ain't givin' a fuck

If God love me, why I'm missin' my bro?
Is God ugly? If ya'll love me, nigga, wish me love
Appetite for destruction, I'm back popping [Incomprehensible] again
Drinkin' 'nac heavy until I'm happy again

Although I get comfort from friends
I won't be truly happy till I see him I again
So until that day I'm goin' out in the blaze
Hope the world forgive me 'coz I lost my way

I said there's no such thing as the straight path
My brother got hit the other day by straight blasts

A guy that spent most of his life dealin' with dirt

But as soon as he decides to get a 9 to 5
Why would God decide to take his life?
There's no such thing as the straight path

Disappointedly, the craziest things happen
I mean, never knew I'd lose so many people, you know
Such a short time, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm only twenty five, know what I mean?

Lord, it was not even like I was fifteen know what I'm sayin'?
Lost all hopes by fourteen, know what I mean?
[Incomprehensible]
Lot of stress, man, right now

So much [Incomprehensible], yo, it's time, hold your head up [Incomprehensible]
And to my man Lou who just passed, know what I mean?
All this nonsense goin' on in the street
It's just that life we lead know what I'm sayin'

We caught up in it man, but just when you do dirt
Just know you can never clean it up man
There's no such thing as a straight path

I said there's no such thing as a straight path
Unless you come out the womb on a straight path
And if you live, way I live, dog, how long can that last?
When everyday of our life we live more like a task

All the principals had to keep it official

I bought the pistol turn dudes to fish food
These dudes want me lookin all miserable
Don't want me getting paper, go to Jacobs , or spend a few

Takin bout how I been in coups
And how tech will sprig a nigga like a innerlube

The numbers never lie so you can't refute it
And don't confuse M with none of the bullshit
To the street I'm tied, like my mommas shoes is
I couldnt fathom the sight of me losing
Any Malcolm X Boulevard I'm bout movement
Im getting money I don't need ya two cents
The structures been build way before the blue print
   
[Chorus] 

Yeah it's M to the E,M heading to the top wit this
Say it's niggas on the rock that don't wanna rock wit this
Damn! Thats the thanks I get
When you know I'm the one that started all this fuckin gangster shit
Riding out with the peeps, smoking that refer with Jena 
'Cause me and Jena tag team and beatin the beat up
Rockin the Caesar, pushin the two seater with Jesus 
Niggas didn't believe us, now they hate when they see us
 In the crib got multiple features
Anybody gotta thought or none of them lease
This is a gift from God, I don't go to the preacher
I've flossed for years you watch me I'll teach ya
I just dropped M.A.D.E. I admit it was a sleeper
Anybody  without pocket, now I'm beatin the streets up
Put it in my hood, in two weeks it heats up
We've don stacked up but Jay will never leave us

[Chorus]",Alright,2005
Memphis Bleek,"Dear summer I know you're gonna miss me
For we been together like Nike Airs and crisp tees
S dots with polo fleeces
Purple label shit with the logo secret
Gimme couple years, shit I might just sneak in
A couple words and like peaches and herb
We'll be reunited and it feels so hood
Have the whole world saying ""How you still so good?""
Well I do this in my slumber summer
I ain't none of these half-assed newcomers, you know how I do summer
I drop heat, when you bring the sun up
The combo make niggas act up, I pick the gun up
Niggas back up; they know I'm not no frontier
I don't talk shit, I just flip it un' ya
Sorry Lance, I'm just trying to advance my quotes
I ain't making you the butt of my jokes
But let's not stray from what I came to say
To my beloved, think we need some time away
They say if you love it, you should let it out its cage
And fuck it, if it comes back you know it's there to stay
It's tugging, at my heart, but this time apart is needed
From the public, who should've gave me the pulits'
Instead gave me they ass to kiss
But you know me, thugging 'til the casket dips
But still shine light down on all my peers
I know they weird, some queer, I still want them to share
And all the success I received, I know you can't believe
I still love 'em but they don't love me
They like the drunk uncle in your family
You know they lame, you feel ashamed, but you love 'em the same
It's like when niggas make subliminal records
If it ain't directed directly at me, I don't respect it
You don't really want it with Hov, for the record
I put a couple careers on hold, you could be next kid
Keep entering the danger sone
You gon' make that boy Hov put your name in a song
If you that hungry for fame, motherfucker come on
Say when, take ten paces and spin
But on another note, 'bout to take another vaca'
On another boat, goddamn a motherfucker rode
His way out the hood, and I pray that I stay out for good
But any day you know a nigga could
Try and play like he Suge, then I gotta play like Dutch Schults
You pass the dutchie, I blast you, trust me
Niggas can't fuck with me
I'm in a good mood, you lucky, I got a good groove
And I ain't trying to fuck my thing up
But I will lay down a couple green bucks, get you cleaned up
Now I'm Pulp Fiction, Colt four-fifth and
Young niggag that blast for me (blasphemy), no religion

Listen here summer baby, I just believe it's the right thing to do
I got a brand new bitch, corporate America
She showing me a lot of action right now
And I know you put me on my feet and all, but
I mean, it's time for me to grow
You gotta let me go baby, you gotta let me go

I'm done for now, so one for now
Possibly forever, we had fun together
But like all good things, we must come to an end
Please show the same love to my friends
Dear summer",Dear Summer,2005

I'm infatuated 
And your my baby, and you complete me 
Your number, I'll call, and maybe we can hook up later 
And keep it gangster 

My design one of a kind, yeah I'm on my grind 
Got a shorty that still trip, but I ain't lost my mind 
I just party and bullshit, my attitude, I'm good ma 
They say I'm hood rich because I drive big cars 
Getting guac 
Middle finger to cops 
They say when you meet the one, all the thug should stop 
I met this shorty the other morning, on my way in y'all 
She was bad, I didn't call, I'm a day in y'all 
But, that's the rules, we don't make em, we don't break em 
I don't sweat em, I forget em and find a way to shack em 
But, I put a holla to her, I spit some lava at her 
She from the burbs, I'm from the jecks, trust that don't matter 
She into books too, I'm off the books for the things I do 
But that's between me and you 
And I don't really full tag it a lot, I'm in the wagon a lot 
With different dimes on the passenger side 
I'm like

All the time (all the time) 
And I scoop you like a solja' would 
I'm in the woods, top down, like I don't got a hood 
They say opposites attract, and it's true 
Cause girl I'm from the gutter, where the bundles will move 
And you, is from where its cool and quiet at night 
And ain't no young'ns supplying the white, right 
But that's a different story, lets get back to the night 
And you've got a body, I can handle it right?, right 
And I know you heard about me, beyond the rumors about me 
I'm the fliest a little youngin' could be, be 
And you'll see with us together, its money, diamonds, whatever 
Little momma is you riding with me?, me 
And I love the thing you do, so baby girl never change 
And forever we can do that thing 
Cause

I love, love that thing you do 
And I, I can't get my eyes, my mind off you 
I'm infatuated 
And your my baby, and you complete me 
Give me your number I'm gonna call you lady 
And maybe we can hook up later 
And keep it gangster 

Now you know my stees' 
Cause I ain't gotta smooth that to do that thing 
And it only took a night to get it right, grip it right, hit it right 
Figure out that you a rider for life, down for whatever 
We go through it together 
You know the boys style, way beyond all the regular 
I need a switch, like a fein need a fix 
Every g, need a down ass chick, to click 
That's sick

I love, love that thing you do

I graduated grads, got my diploma
I could tell by your aroma you smokin' on Arizona
But you ain't got no Cali Kush
You're smoking on that backyard bush

Quiet it's kept like hush, plus
You ain't never had no Florida Crip
Beat that'd have you tripping

I take two to the chest for all my niggaz that left

Man fuck this shit man, Gu, twist something up
I'm gonna come out there, let the bridge ride on 'em

Memphis Bleek,"I said there's no such thing as the straight path
My brother got hit the other day by straight blasts
In the brain, on the train, on his way to work
A guy that spent most of his life dealin' with dirt

But as soon as he decides to get a 9 to 5
Why would God decide to take his life?
There's no such thing as the straight path

So it's whatever with me, I walk through the mind
Feel whatever could hit me
My mind filled with anger hope the angels is with me
Change could be dangerous

Goin' legit could be signing your death certificate
Calling it quits could be the worst thing you do
I mean consider your enemy
He ain't gonna quit 'coz you quit now, is he?
Think about it

So what's on infinitely with me
I'm gonna turn to finity for the tough times I pour Hennessey
In memory of that one thing that meant one thing to me
I'm on, somethin' in me wishin' I wan't born

Come on, a gangsta say quttin' the game
Man, you lookin' at a dead man talkin'
He's always a brother or cousin to somebody you fought
Who might forgive but that don't happen too often

I said there's no such thing as the straight path
My brother got hit the other day by straight blasts
In the brain, on the train, on his way to work
A guy that spent most of his life dealin' with dirt

But as soon as he decides to get a 9 to 5
Why would God decide to take his life?
There's no such thing as the straight path

I said there's no such thing as the straight path
I said there's no such thing as the straight path

When the gun burn everythin'
You been taught you must unlearn
With one turn of the world, one fatal stroke I'd have lost all hope now I'm goin' for broke

So my new motto is smoke clear, kiss smoke
When you lose everything you love it's time to grip the snob
The time for talking is done, listen for one
If you got that weight on you I'll be liftin' you up
Hope you got that aid on you, I ain't givin' a fuck

If God love me, why I'm missin' my bro?
Is God ugly? If ya'll love me, nigga, wish me love
Appetite for destruction, I'm back popping [Incomprehensible] again
Drinkin' 'nac heavy until I'm happy again

Although I get comfort from friends
I won't be truly happy till I see him I again
So until that day I'm goin' out in the blaze
Hope the world forgive me 'coz I lost my way

I said there's no such thing as the straight path
My brother got hit the other day by straight blasts
In the brain, on the train, on his way to work
A guy that spent most of his life dealin' with dirt

But as soon as he decides to get a 9 to 5
Why would God decide to take his life?
There's no such thing as the straight path

Disappointedly, the craziest things happen
I mean, never knew I'd lose so many people, you know
Such a short time, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm only twenty five, know what I mean?

Lord, it was not even like I was fifteen know what I'm sayin'?
Lost all hopes by fourteen, know what I mean?
[Incomprehensible]
Lot of stress, man, right now

So much [Incomprehensible], yo, it's time, hold your head up [Incomprehensible]
And to my man Lou who just passed, know what I mean?
All this nonsense goin' on in the street
It's just that life we lead know what I'm sayin'

We caught up in it man, but just when you do dirt
Just know you can never clean it up man
There's no such thing as a straight path

I said there's no such thing as a straight path
Unless you come out the womb on a straight path
And if you live, way I live, dog, how long can that last?
When everyday of our life we live more like a task

I said there's no such thing as a straight path
I said there's no such thing as a straight path

Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car
Matchin' the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggaz think I fell out the loop
Cause the last time they seen me hoppin', out the Coupe
I hopped out in a suit

Look at this nigga Jay frontin' tryin' to take my shine
I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind
Plus I'm puffin like an ounce, more than I used to puff
Takin' advice from these niggaz but they ain't used to stuff
They had me thinkin, ""Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff
While he drive around town in brand new Coupe's and stuff""
Swear to God, they had me practically hating his guts
As he approached I spoke, ""Jigga whattup?""

Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart
I felt his hatred it was harsh, 'fore this fakin shit start
I should take him in back of the building and blaze him

Uh-oh, this nigga Jay he ain't slow, he musta picked up on the vibe
And had I, not been so high I woulda been able to hide
Tried to cover up myself, as I gave him a five
Hugged him, as if I loved him

To the naked eye
It woulda seemed we was the closest, but to those that know us
Could see that somethin' was about to go down

Stay focused
I'm tryin' to concentrate, but it's like he's reading my mind
As if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
Could he see I had plans on, bein the man
Ever since we first spoke and he put that G in my hand
And I gave it back to show him, I was down for the cause
As he approached (""Whattup Bleek?"") and I paused..

Right, yo we wild out in Vegas, styled on haters
Mouthed off at the cops, I done crammed every drop
Copped whips the same color, we tighter than brothers
With different fathers but same mothers, this life don't love us
So til death do us, I'm never breakin my bond

As I stand
One leg of my pants up, in a stance like, ""Man what?""
I know these niggaz are peepin my mind cancer
But in time's the answer
Seems mind-blowin, this weed and Hennesey
Got my mind goin, trust me nigga, I'm knowin
Chicks used to ignore me, and my aunt sayin I need fifty
Not sixty-forty

Oh God, don't let him control y'all
Your gun is my gun, your clip is my clip baby

Your fun is my fun (uh-huh) your bitch is my bitch
Any nigga tryin' to harm Jay I'm feelin' for you

Sorry big, I tried
Honest
Can't go with me on this ride though
I'm calling the shots
The bar's closing
Where we going to for breakfast?
Roc-a-fella y'all
Okay, I'm reloaded!

""Bringing the drama""
""Trying to come up in the game""
""Marcy""
""Had a couple of dollar signs to my name""
""Roc-a-fella y'all""
""One of the best!""
""Waiting for my day to come""
""Just give me the word""

Nah this ain't jigga it's your lil nigga bleek
Reporting to these motherfuckers live from the street
Game I peeped those, my mind so advanced
At nine I used to geese hoes for Easter clothes
Peep the steez, I represent for all those
With twenty eight grams, on a come-up trying to creep the keys
Large niggas told me park the car, keep the keys
Find a hoodrat and creep to mickey d's
First gun two bullets, niggas know I do pull it
Niggas trying to kill me dog, who wouldn't?
Screw Gooden, I pitch in the pj's
Lit off the ej, I split dutchies with my ring finger
You find a bitch that don't be cream, bring her
Last seen with Bing, he got dropped between us
Shit is constant, that's why I pack the
Johnson and Johnson for the nonsense who wants it?
I go to sleep with a picture of a Porsche on my wall
Man I'm trying to come up on y'all
Get one up on y'all, that's why I hustle in these streets
From sundown to sunup on y'all
Mama said keep bullshitting they'll kill you dead
One week of this hustling brought a living room set
Went to ? d's, niggas mad, veins out
Copped the Jordan's, two weeks before they came out
Flashy, fly little nigga
Nosy bitch from the third floor like ""why little nigga?""
Bitch please, twist the trees
Took a long pull, like bitch to breathe
That's my answer, life's like cancer
And I'm serious

International,
Show y'all young boys how to do this thing

The maturation of Jay-Z, Z
Check me out

30's the new twenty, nigga 
I'm so hot still
Better broad, better automobile
Bet a yard, nah, bet a hundred mill
Then by the songs end, I probably start another trend
I know everything you wan do
I did all that by the age of twenty-one
By twenty-two I had that brand new Ack Coupe
I guess you can say that my legend just begun
I'm young enough to know the right car to buy 
Yet grown enough not to put rims on it
I got that six-deuce with curtains so you can't see me 
And I didn't even have to put tints on it
I don't got the bright watch, I got the right watch
I don't buy out the bar, I bought the night spot
I got the right stock
I got stockbrokers that's movin' it like white tops
I know you like fuck this is child abuse
Call diapers, I might just be gettin' nicer
Them young boys ain't ready for real
30's the new twenty, nigga 
I'm so hot still

[Chorus]
I used to let my pants sag, not givin' a fuck
Bad boy, now I'm all grown up
I use to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Bad boy, now I'm all grown up
I use to play the block like that (like that)
I use to carry knots like that (like that)
Now I got black cards, good credit and such
Bad boy, 'cause I'm all grown up

30's the new twenty, nigga, I'm on fire still
These young boys is like a fire drills (uh)
False alarms (uh)
Next don? (nah)
He got (on)
To the next one (young)
I'm still here (yeah)
Still here like Mike, gotta stop playin' with these children's (yeah)
I'm a bully with the bucks
Don't let the patten leather shoes fool you, youngin'
I got the fully in the tux
That was my past, now I'm so grown up
I don't got one gun army, got a slum army
To hire a gun army, get you spun like laundry
And I'll be somewhere under palm trees calmly
Listen to R and B when we get the call he's
No longer wit' us, fire your babysitters
You lil' fucks fall back for real
30's the new twenty, nigga
I'm so hot still

[Chorus]

Y'all roll blunts, I smoke Cubans all day
Y'all youngin's chase, I'm Patron, and it's Grey
I like South Beach, but I'm in Saint Tropez
Y'all drink Dom but not Rose (hey)
Your chick shop in the mall
My chick burnin' down Berdolph's
Comin' back with Birken Bags
Your chick is like what type of purse is that?
I'm from the era where niggas don't snitch
You from the era where snitchin' is the shit
I'm afraid of the future (why?)
Y'all respect the one who got shot
I respect the shooter
Y'all go to parties to ice grill
I go to parties to party with nice girls
You young boys gotta chill

Snap they neck, then shoot em til they arch them back

Check out my swag yo, I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go, you are what you are player

I went from Marcy to Hollywood
And back again and back again
As a youth I used to hold the weed up
Old heads said I thought more like a soldier than a leader
In order to succeed I had to slow my speed up
Didn't listen to stuff took another puff of the chieva
They said believe us or not trust is somethin' you earn
With every mistake you make back to us you return
Probably would go Hollywood I thought he was jokin'
My first taste of fame I hit the first thing smokin'
All engulfed into honeys the pussy was tight
If she threw the pussy right I got mushy like
Damn baby I love you take all my cash
""You ain't got to lie Jay,"" you already gettin' the ass
She loved that I was a thug it turned her on
Soon as I got soft it turned her off
I got relaxed put my feet up start dissin' my friends
And that's when the ceiling fell in
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
And back again and back again
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
And back again and back again
I came through with the shines
Like the streets was blind
Didn't master my Algebra no caliber
Stick me? I was thinkin' how and for what
But reality bites like a thousand mutts
Nothin' worse than the person that's foul with guts
To stick you quicker

This brand new nigga
Yup this is the foulest this ain't Hollywood
It's the Wild West whoever guns is the loudest
That's who's the best now take ten steps and draw
Who dope can take ten steps and remain raw
Who has no regards for the law?
Me that's who now let me ask you
Did you not know if we all don't eat
Some day that we all would beef?
Did you know about the crabs in the barrow
They would hear me creep
It's a muthafuckin' war in these streets
I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto
And I'm back again I'm back again
I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto
And I'm back again I'm back again

Old heads said I thought more like a leader than a soldier
Back in the days never no heat thought shit was cool
Good cat personified even went to school
Learned wild shit made me feel kinda live
Off of nothin' with this bullshit 9 to 5
I stayed broke made me easier to provoke
Ready to yoke the first muthafucka that joked
Same dude with the hard bottom
Went from laid back to locced out
From talk it over to t...I shot him
Ready to perish all the shit you cherish
Leave you the wettest I got a ""You die first,"" fetish
I can recall helpin' old chicks across the street
Now I help myself liftin' cats off they feet
Can't give a fuck nigga I just lost my moms
Why I need to feel something steel in both my arms

I'ma make it real easy for why'all. You got three different
Types of nigga. First cat, as a youth is real wild and
For whatever reason he hit the money or whatever,
Cooled out. You got one cat that's ghetto, grimy always
Remained ghetto. You know that type. Then, you got
One cat very smart young man. E'rybody wanted him
To be a lawyer doctor whatever. Pressure drove him crazy
He wiled out. Ha geah...

I told her, ""Darlin', I's comin' to go have some fun"" 
You know, I went to make her swing out when a rat fell from her head like, 
one from a burnin' barn 
I say, I don't want no woman, 
boy, if her hair it ain't no longer 'an mine 
You know she ain't no good for nothin' but trouble, did ya know 'at?

Men of Standard,"Ever wonder why we sometimes have to go through hard times
Even though we've been living the best we know how

I will never let go, I will always stay strong
I will go wherever, I will do whatever

Must go even when we don't want to go

Just say, I will never give up, I will keep on holding on
I will never let go, I will always stay strong
I will go wherever, I will do whatever
I will say whatever, I will, you just tell me and I will

Now listen here
I made up my mind a long time ago
That whenever the Lord calls me
My answer will be yes

Is there anybody out there
That feels the way I do?

They talk for nothing, they talk for free
They talk behind your back and to you're face they're really sweet
Check out the language, check out the clothes

They go to parties to steal the show

End up in some disco dancing all night & day.

Just waiting for the perfect view 
I hope something special will step into my life 
Another fine edition of you 

A pin up done in shades of blue 
Some don't play yourself for a fool 
Too much cheesecake too soon 
And don't let this happen to you 

Sometimes you find you're yearning for the quiet life 
The country air and all of its joys 
But badgers couldn't compensate at twice the price 
For just another night with the boys 

And boys will be boys will be boys 
They say love's a gamble hard to win easy to lose 
And while sun shines you'd better make hay 
So if life is your table and fate is the wheel 

Then let the chips fall where they may 
In modern times the modern way 
And as I was drifting past the lorelei 
I heard those slinky sirens wail (ooo) 

So look out sailor when you hear them croon 
You'll never be the same again oh no 
Their crazy music drives you insane this way 
So love me leave me do what you will 

... who knows what tomorrow might bring 
Learn from your mistakes is my only advice 
And stay cool is the main rule

So we stopped to get a bite to eat
At the local barbecue
It's just another borin' Monday
An' there's nothin' else to do

Now as we stepped out of the car
I heard someone behind me fightin'
So I turned to look and find out
What's the cause of this excitement

One brother was a dopefiend
And the other was a dopeman
And the dopeman had a AK
Said he'll spray an' he's not jokin'

Well, it seems to be the dopefiend
Owed the dopeman for his product
And he swore if he did not pay
He would end up gettin' shot up

Now I could not walk away
'Cause I got caught up in the scene
Wonderin' what would happen
To this poor and helpless fiend

Well, my homie Michael Cooley
Said let's go and make our order
What's the use in watchin' two men
Stand out here fight over quarters

Well, I walked inside the diner
And all the dopefiends waved to me
Heard the sound of several gunshots
And I ran outside to see

(What's goin' on?)
Another gunshot rings
(What's goin' on?)
Another siren rings
(What's goin' on?)
Another mother cries
(What's goin' on?)
'Cause another innocent dies
(What's goin' on?)

(What's goin' on?)
Another gunshot rings
(What's goin' on?)
Another siren rings
(What's goin' on?)
Another mother cries
(What's goin' on?)
'Cause another innocent dies
(What's goin' on?)

All the people in the diner
Ran outside to see the big show
It was just another party
For them to see just who they would know

But for me I held concern
I wanted to go see the outcome
Would a mother have a son tonight
Or would she live her life without one?

I made it to the streets
I almost cried right on the spot
Not only had the fiend died
But a small girl had been shot

My heart could take no more
I felt a tear roll down my face
That was daddy's bullet
But she took it in his place

(What's goin' on?)
Another gunshot rings
(What's goin' on?)
Another siren rings
(What's goin' on?)
Another mother cries
(What's goin' on?)
'Cause another innocent dies
(What's goin' on?)

(What's goin' on?)
Another gunshot rings
(What's goin' on?)
Another siren rings
(What's goin' on?)
Another mother cries
(What's goin' on?)
'Cause another innocent dies
(What's goin' on?)

Tried to make way through the crowd
So I could go help the baby
She could barely speak but she whispered
""Mister, can you please save me?""

So I screamed out, ""Someone help me""
But I don't think they could hear
And if they did they didn't care
Oh, how I hated everyone there

The baby lie here dyin'
And I wondered what could I do
The cameraman and newspapers
Had come to get their interviews

To them it's just story
And they can't see the tragedy
To them it doesn't matter
'Cause hey, it wasn't their family

I don't think I'll be back
'Cause it'll never be the same here
So I wipe away the tears
And leave the scene the way I came here

Though some people say it's crazy
And the food could have been finer
I'll never forget
Never forget the night at Dopefiend's Diner
