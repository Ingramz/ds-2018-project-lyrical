Il Volo,"Granada, tierra soñada por mi
Mi cantar se vuelve gitano
Cuando es para ti
Mi cantar hecho de fantasía
Mi cantar, flor de melancolía
Que you te vengo a dar
Granada,
Tierra ensangrentada
En tardes de toros
Mujer que conserva el embrujo
De los ojos moros
De sueño rebelde y gitana
Cubierta de flores
Y beso tu boca de grana
Jugosa manzana
Que me habla de amores
Granada Manola
Cantada en coplas preciosas
No tengo otra cosa que darte
Que un ramo de rosas
De rosas de suave fragancia
Que le dieran marco
A la Virgen Morena
Granada
Tu tierra está llena de lindas mujeres
De sangre y de sol",Granada,2016
Il Volo,"Nessun dorma
Nessun dorma
Tu pure, o, Principessa
Nella tua fredda stanza
Guardi le stelle
Che tremano d'amore
E di speranza

Ma il mio mistero e chiuso in me
Il nome mio nessun saprà
No, no, sulla tua bocca lo dirò
Quando la luce splenderà

Ed il mio bacio scioglierà il silenzio
Che ti fa mia

(Il nome suo nessun saprà
E noi dovrem, ahimé, morir, morir)

Dilegua, notte
Tramontate, stelle 
Tramontate, stelle
All'alba vincerò
Vincerò
Vincerò",Nessun Dorma,2016
Il Volo,"Che bella cosa na jurnata 'e sole
N'aria serena doppo na tempesta
Pe' ll'aria fresca pare gia' na festa

Cchiu' bello, oi ne'

What a wonderful thing a sunny day
The cool air after a thunderstorm
The fresh breezes banish the heavy air
What a wonderful thing a sunny day

But another sun
That's brighter still
It's my own sun 
That's in your face
The sun, my own sun
It's in your face
It's in your face

Shining is the glass from your window
A washwoman is singing and bragging
Wringing and hanging laundry and singing
Shining is the glass from your window

But another sun
That's brighter still
It's my own sun 
That's in your face
The sun, my own sun
It's in your face
It's in your face

When night comes and the sun 
Has gone down
I start feeling blue
I'd stay below your window
When night comes and the sun 
Has gone down

But another sun
That's brighter still
It's my own sun 
That's in your face
The sun, my own sun
It's in your face
It's in your face",O Sole Mio,2016
Il Volo,"Vide 'o mare quant?è bello,
Spira tantu sentimento,
Comme tu a chi tiene mente,
Ca scetato 'o faie sunnà.

Guarda, gua?, chistu ciardino;
Siente, sie? sti sciure arance:
Nu profumo accussi fino
Dinto 'o core se ne va?

E tu dice: ""I? parto, addio!""
T?alluntane da stu core?
Da sta terra de l?ammore?
Tiene 'o core 'e nun turnà?

Ma nun me lassà,
Nun darme stu turmiento!
Torna a Surriento,
Famme campà!

Vide 'o mare de Surriento,
Che tesoro tene nfunno:
Chi ha girato tutto 'o munno
Nun l'ha visto comm'a ccà.

Guarda attuorno sti Sserene,
Ca te guardano 'ncantate,
E te vonno tantu bene...
Te vulessero vasà.

E tu dice: ""I' parto, addio!""
T'alluntane da stu core
Da sta terra de l'ammore

Il Volo,"Si estoy Agotado
Repones mis fuerzas
Si estoy derrotado
Me das esperanza

Si muero de Angustia
Me das Alegría

Jamas me has dejado
Y nunca lo harías

Si un día el camino
Se pone borroso

Y miedo de noche
Me asalta el sollozo

Me abrazas el Alma
Me duermo tranquilo

Jamas he dejado de sentir tu alivio

Inmenso
Tu amor es inmenso

Que me abriga, me calma
Me cura, los males de adentro

Inmenso
Tu amor es inmenso

Irrompible tu amor
Infinito, tu amor es eterno

Si aveces mi enojo
Me nubla la vista

Conversas conmigo
Me das una pista

Me enjugas el llanto
Tu amor es perfecto

Me lavas los pies
Y me soplas aliento

Tu amor es inmenso

Que me abriga, me calma
Me cura

Il Volo,"La noche, se perdió en tu pelo
La luna, se aferró a tu piel
Y el mar se sintió celoso
Y quiso en tus ojos, estar él también

Tu boca, sensual, peligrosa
Tus manos, la dulzura son
Tu aliento, fatal fuego lento
Que quema mis ansias y mi corazón

Ternuras que sin prisa apuras
Caricias que brinda el amor
Caprichos muy despacio dichos
Entre la penumbra de un suave interior

Te quiero, y ya nada importa
La vida, lo ha dictado así
Si quieres, yo te doy el mundo
Pero no me pidas, que no te ame así

Si quieres yo te doy el mundo
Pero no me pidas, que no te ame así
Que no te ame así, que no te ame así

Il Volo,"Mi alzo e fuori è ancora luna piena 
Esco per toccare la mia terra 
È un'altra notte da scordare 
Niente che ti fa capire 
Questa vita poi che senso ha 

In un silenzio fatto per pregare 
Forte un dolore sale a farmi male 
Ma è un vento che si placa in un momento 
E lascia dentro tanto freddo 
E insieme tanta povertà 

E va 
Il mio pensiero se ne va 
Seguendo un volo che già sa 
In quale cuore andare e arriverà 

E va 
È la mia età che se ne va 
E quanto amore via con lei 
È questa vita che passa e dove andrà 

Rientro piano e come fossi un clown 
Lentamente prendo a disegnare 
Il cerchio rosso del sorriso 
Luce bianca sul mio viso 
Nuovamente pronto a cominciare

E va 
Il mio pensiero se ne va 
Seguendo un volo che già sa 
In quale cuore andare e arriverà 

E va 
È la mia età che se ne va 
E quanto amore via con lei 
È questa vita che passa e dove andrà 
È la mia vita che passa e dove andrà",E' La Mia Vita,2011
Il Volo,"La luna hizo esto fue culpa de la luna
Haberme enamorado enamorado de ti
Su brillo reflejo entre tus ojos mi fortuna
La luna lo hizo así

La luna hizo esto despacio a su manera
Logró que se encendiera mi corazón
Al cielo le agradezco brindarme su ternura
La luna me hechizó

Yo nunca creí poderme enamorar
La luna logró hacerlo realidad
Hoy mi mundo eres tu

La luna hizo esto fue culpa de la luna
La luna lo hizo así

Il Volo,"Smile when your heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by
If you smile through your fear and sorrows
Smile and maybe tomorrow 
You see the sun come shinning through for you
Light up your face with gladness
Hide any trace of sadness
Although our tears be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find life is still worth while
If you just smile

Il Volo,"After all the empty stars
And the beautiful illusions
How can I be sure you're even here
Maybe in too cynical
To fall until is proven
Or maybe you're my year after year 
Tell me you're in
Tell me I'm home
Promise you'll stay
And don't let me go
I'm waiting for a sign
So tell me that is real this time
Open up the curtains 
And clear off all the tables
I'm hoping we can change my history
'Cause who am I to recognize 
The truth from a fable
And you're the one I wanted to believe
Tell me you're in
Tell me I'm home
Promise you'll stay 
And don't let me go
I'm waiting for a signal
So tell me that it's real this time
Let me in 
Kill this doubt
'Cause from this high it's along way down
Break my fall catch me know

Tell me I'm home
Promise you'll stay

""You got the world in the palm of your hand.""
Frankie, didn't I tell you,
""They're running at your command.""

You know the chains as if they're your invention.
It wasn't your intention,

To fall in the trap you made.

It's a crying shame.
You left a trail of destruction.

Frankie, didn't I tell you,
""The lion would come in for a kill,""
Frankie, didn't I say,
""It had power over your sweet skill.""

So where is the laughter you spat right in their faces?

Ila Vann,"Oh listen, sister,
I love my mister man,
And I can't tell yo' why,
There ain't no reason
Why I should love that man.
It must be something that the angels done plan.

Fish got to swim, birds got to fly,
I got to love one man till I die.
Can't help loving that man of mine.
Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow,
Tell me I'm crazy (maybe I know).
Can't help loving that man of mine.
When he goes away
That's a rainy day,
But when he comes back that day is fine,
The sun will shine!
He kin come home as late as kin be,
Home without him ain't no home to me.
Can't help loving that man of mine.

My man is shiftless
An' good for nothing too
(He's my man just the same)

He's never round here
When there is work to do.
He's never round here when there's working to do.

The roof is leaking in,
But he don't seem to care.
He kin be happy

Si me debes mirar, es para quererme
Quiero vivir en mi mundo ciego
Y arrepentirme luego
Aunque se, que no eres suficiente para mi
Consolare todas mis iluciones para seguir aquí
Enredada en el nudo de tu mente infeliz
Calmando el matiz
No llores nostalgia
No me hieras así por favor

Y me nacieron dos antenas
Y mientras fotografiaban
Sin que nadie nos viera
Se posaron tus deditos 
Como rana en mi espalda

No sabia si moverme
Si dejarme acariciar
Me hacen faltan las caricias
En estas hora de amar
Y un brazo invisible me salió de la pared
De la piel, de mi espalda
Que esta extraña de querer

Se me estiraban los brazos
Y de ahí desde esa piel
Me salían una y una largas manos a la vez
Y de pronto tenía 8 y estaban alrededor de ti
Y fue justo cuando con dolor lo decidí

Que no podía continuar
En tan escueta canción
Que tus brazos y los míos 
Hacían una ovación
De cariños que no pueden
Por favor, hazme el amor
Dame toda la energía
Que necesito un favor

Para recuperar algo de lo que se echó a perder
Y vivir ya paso a paso con mi cría y su querer
Fuerzas para entender que no necesito mucho más que a mi
Me escribía PerKins Jeans sutilmente en su tapiz

Y trepe por las paredes llegué al techo, te perdí
Se me amarilló de pronto cierto trozo de nariz
Cuando mire hacia mi arriba te vi abajo a mis pies
Y en la tez se me veían amarillo de tu piel

Y fue que ahí que decidí, manos déjenlo salir
Y dejar que el aire cubra este mítico jardín
Se llenó de aire el mar luego casi no te vi
Y ya cuando regrésaste ya todo resulto al fin

Pero que noche mas loca y que linda a la vez
Descansar en cuatro notas que yo misma me invente
Tener alas, volar alto de la barra a orinar
Y lograr al fin callarte y a tus manos trasladar

Te doy gracias hoy, por tanto, por aquel viejo lugar
En el que con mis antenas nos logramos conectar
En el que una araña dulce por amar salió de mi
Y me convertí en insecto como Kafka en frenesí",Extraña de Querer,2016

¿Cómo quieres que te diga?
Que no puedo dependerte
¿Cómo quieres que yo viva?

Que no sabemos soltar

Is there something on your mind
I'm still healing from the silence
That you left behind

Do my tears have any meaning?

Seems you´re speaking but your words
They come out dry

My heart is out of place
And what do you have to say?
It´s hard to see 
Through your childish face
When you keep running
Oh running away

Do you, do you think in silences?
Are you even here?
Do you, do you think in silences?
How does it feel?

Time goes by
And I'm not able to forget

A distant sorrow
That lingers on
Become nothing until is gone

Even if things the same
I wont be afraid

Lo que yo estoy sintiendo desde que te vi llegar un día a mi vida
No se como disimular
Que tengo un alboroto que me pica poco a poco todo el día

Quizás tan solo es de decirlo
O el llamar a algún amigo
Y confesarle mi secreto
Quizás sea mejor guardarlo
Alimentarlo y no entregarlo
Hasta que no pueda aguantarlo ni un segundo no mi amor

Que si te digo la verdad
Tan solo quiero de tu boca
Que me digas que tu amor es como el sol que me ilumina
Que ya no quiero aparentar
Tan solo quiero contemplarte
Como luna que se cuelga en tu balcón muriendo el día

Y si te digo la verdad
Voy a escribir todos mis versos
Que te tengo por decir para entregarte vida mía
Que ya no me quiero aguantar
Te vas a tener que enterar
Que mis latidos tienen dueño para siempre en tu guarida*

Cayo la luz que alumbra el día
Y empieza mi delirio por querer que ya amanezca para verte
La noche es larga sin tenerte
Y paso en mi desvelo suspirando una caricia pa' quererte

Quizás no tengo que esperar
Te lo repito sin cesar
Entenderás lo que yo siento
No tengo más con que abreviar
Mi corazón se va a estallar
Por retenerte todo el tiempo aquí en mi mente si mi amor

Que si te digo la verdad
Tan solo quiero de tu boca
Que me digas que tu amor es como el sol que me ilumina
Que ya no quiero aparentar
Tan solo quiero contemplarte
Como luna que se cuelga en tu balcón muriendo el día

Guárdame siempre donde no haya frío
Arropa este amor que te tengo
Mírame a los ojos para hacerme mía
Y deja asi que yo te quiera, yo te quiera, si mi amor

Tiempo pa' estar contigo
Dame de tu boca, boca que provoca cada parte de mis sentidos

Tiempo pa' estar contigo

Ilene Weiss,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Cause this is how we do it
We got my man Soundwave in the house, Alien Nation
To my nigga the low-down dirty drop-out from high school, Big Ill
And me Mr. Raspy, Al Skratch
To my nigga LIC representin Conspiracy
Yeah
Soundwave, break em off

[ VERSE 1: Soundwave ]
You say you never heard the Sound
I'm about to break em off somethin right now
Open up your mind and let me in
Knock-knock, who speaks in the voice of sin?
Must drop to your knees, please just listen
A tale of four blackmen reminiscin
I hover in the heavens like a celestial guardian
The one who blocks the bullets when you're wildin out partyin
Believe in the MC cause you can see me not
Soundwave, faster than the dot on the Glock
Non-stop cyber-funkin, let me tell you somethin
Bout that guy named Al Skratch, the Mack Big Ill, LIC
This is virtual reality
A rap fantasy of the life of four beings
Seen through the eyes of the one foreseeing
Funkin em up, come on to the right
I'm funkin em up, come on to the left
The Uptown Connect gonna funk you to death

[ VERSE 2: Al Skratch & Big Ill the Mack ]
Who want to fuck around, who want to clown
With two niggas from the Brooklyn Uptown underground
Well, it's the backstabber, the double-crosssin alki
Stagger as I'm babblin, so nigga please don't doubt me
When I was ten they took my flick at the precint
Back in the days I was a juvenile delinquent
So don't fuck with me cause I'm psychotic
I kick the hard shit and let my man get melodic
Aiyo, I'm rollin, rollin, rollin
I'll lump you up and leave you swollen
The mic that I'm holdin is golden
Patrollin straight out the fiery pits
I turn a page as my diary gets
Deeper, I see this Mack type figure, who is he?
Bitches want to know, so Ill get busy
I got the latest news, ask Conny Chung
Tu madre ( ? )
That means your mama want to suck my dick, faggot
The bitch is a hoe so you know I'm gonna bag it
We makin moves over funky fat grooves
And to crews that don't paid dues we bad news
So who want to gangbang, tell me who can hang; slang
Is what I kick, stay off my dick, chitty-bang-bang
With the glock you could swing on my block
And I'll knock the shit out of your ass with the quick fast
Who want to fuck around, who want to clown
With two niggas from the Brooklyn Uptown underground
Who want to fuck around, who want to clown
With two niggas from the Brooklyn Uptown underground

[ VERSE 3: LIC ]
Here it is, steppin to my biz with the free flow steelo
Headcrackin niggas like celo
Comin from below the gutter, I'm quick with my cutter
For a fronter tryin to front, word to mother
On a microphone alone in a zone of danger
With rhymes written on my bullets in a chamber
Word up, you never heard of one murder one felon
Bustin more slugs in thugs indulge in drug-sellin
I stack greenbacks from the wizzacks
Give up raw facts for niggas fakin jacks
Rhymes come in all flavors, I'm makin crazy papers
Cuttin suckers with razors in faces, beatin body cases
LIC, I'm givin lashes, slashes
Holdin classes, controllin masses, bustin asses
Just when I put the ambush to spots
Bustin my mics like Glocks, robbin niggas for they props
The flow is on point, on target, sharp, accurate
Lyrical gun clips I pack you with, then clap you with
Rhyme after rhzzyme, time after time
Like a career criminal committin crime after crime
A gun-clapper ( ? ) type of rapper
LIC, code name come-off-the-head master
Flowin at a high velocity possibly
MC's might snitch, call the cops on me

Yeah
Come around my way

Come around my way
It's the Big Ill with the Al

(This is for the homies)

[ VERSE 1: Al Skratch ]
I got a letter from my homie Big Ill in the mail
It said: Use your head, Al, stay away from jail
Cause ah, it ain't for you and ah, it ain't for me
I tell you now it ain't the place you want to be
So I keep to myself nowadays
Lay back, recline and get paid from my phrase
Sometimes I get caught in a deep thought
As I drink a quart of the cold old dog that I bought
The more I drink, the more I start to think of him
Locked up in the clink, will he sink or swim?
I'm what they call the rap rebel Madball
I'm nice with the dice, watch em bounce off the wall
I come to your party, bounce through with my crew
We pourin out some brew for some homies that we knew
I'm searchin for my homie but he can't be found
I want to give him a pound and let him know that he's down

Where the homies
Creepin through the hood
Where my homies
Come around my way
Aiyo up to no good

(Where my homies)
Where they at, where they at
(Creepin through the neighborhood
For all those good times we had together
This song is for the homies
This is for the homies)

[ VERSE 2: Big Ill the Mack ]
Well, it's Big Ill, the Babblin Bum, the bum that's babblin
Don't try to step to this, my fist be travellin
Unravellin, land on the gravel when you fall
Yes yes y'all, I travel through the messhall
Now where my homie, I'm by my lonely
I shoulda listened to what my mama told me
But it's too late, I'm upstate pumpin weight cause I'm frail
What you gonna do when you get out of jail?
Bust a cap, bust a cap, put that ass on the map
Here's a slap in the grill cause you tried to front on Ill
And I'm locked down (plow!) how the Glock sound?
That's what you get for tryin to blow up the spot, clown
That's the ability, load up the artillery
Your body I'll deliver to the river, gee
Remember me with the (Crooklyn residency)
Now you can take me out of Brooklyn but you can't take Brooklyn out of me
That's how it be, gee

For the missing homies
For all those good times we had together

This is for the homies, yeah)

Straight out the cell with Al, from the fiery pits of hell

Aiyo what's up Al Skratch, now can we woo-woo-woo?

(Come around my way) Aiyo, I want to kick it with your crew

Now that's what my man say
Sometimes I lay in my bed, and I dream of bein' hand-fed
I made the jam, with my man, about the homiez
But now I must remember all about my tenderonis

You're lonely by your homey baby I know how you're feelin'
You in the mood for some sexual healin'
Walk in to the jump I spot you as the music's blarin'
Starin', but not carin', about, what you wearin'

You're full grown with a mind of your own
I make you moan as my bone turn brick like stone

Sign a autograph, then I step with my staff

Crazy deep, don't sleep I keep the poom poom

That's why the girlies they swarm to see Big Ill

Destory you like cancer of the brain
I can't be stopped
I'm faster than the plane that crashed into the trade center
Brain bending pain enter ya nervous system and make you want to turn the other way
Stick yo fuckin head in the dirt, don't even look in my direction
You define trash, I personify perfection
High beemin on the highway driving benzes
Crime scene lookin like a homicide convention
You walk around with a dick in ya mouth
don't ever let the kid joe take a shit in ya house
Trust my judgement, I make bitches lie to there husbands
At my crib on the cell phone crying they love them
Nobodys fault, its all good as long as nobodys caught
Jealousy, put bodys in morgues
Hungry for money and coke, put hotties in porn
won't stop till I put uncle howie in forbes

No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now

I've had my, ups and downs, dealt with cunts and clowns
Major label deals I've been fucked around
Spent years money dangling in front of my face
Instead of blowin the spot, bill was runnin the place
Payed mad dues, shows, made hundreds of tapes
Sold drugs studio time my gun in ya face
Look at me now, Non-Phixion running the game
Kings of the underground and we loving it man
Yea Ill punch you in your face when I'm out on tour
When we was with the beatnuts, I could count about four
Different occasions I had to lace a kid, cold duffed em
One dude bought me a drink after I snuffed em
Promoters talk out the side of they mouth
Till they spitten they own teeth out the side of they mouth
Even the bouncers was scared of us, Callin for peace
While the fagget that got his head cracked, called the police
Ill Bill be the mother fuckin future, its easy to tell
Fuck wit me, Ima see you in hell
So don't fuck wit a bull, achieve the impossible
Cause there ain't no stoppen the unstoppable

No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now

I found your lack of faith disturbing, now my aquisitions are merging
Streets are your, executions are murders, these goons will worship
Like methological gods, beating impossible odds
Comparable in the hood to killing thousands of cops
Pass the good in the bag, take it straight to the ugly
Made in New York, it spread now we raping the country
Stay with the vest, triple x pistols and sex
Money and murderers connect, equals instant success
Ripple effect, we invest, legitimate businessmen
Court rooms to ball rooms expanding the bussiness plan
Listen man, I'm old fashioned
Fuck taking over answer, kidnapp the family and hold em for ransom
We gettin dough yawll, its the jump off
Eather you get with us or fuck off
An unstoppable fource on a rough course
Big success, fuck with me you fuckin wit the best
Fuck who's on top, cause I'm a lot hungrier than them

Ill Bill,"One night, backstage at Irving Plaza at a Madball show

Lars: Hey yo Ill Bill – will you sign this for me?
I found it at Amoeba it's the Green CD
Bill: No doubt kid, what's your name?
Lars: It's MC Lars
Bill: Word, Howie Abrams is a mutual friend of ours
He played me your joint Lars: What'd you think of it?
Bill: I think it's bugged out, it's hot
Lars: Thanks, I like your last record a lot. Your lyrics are
Graphic, much like your brother Necro, is he psycho?
Bill: I don't know, it really depends though
He's Psychological, half psycho, half logical,
Half businessman, half put-them-in-the-hospital
Lars: Business and art, there's a very fine line
There's the person that you are
And the person when you rhyme
But the best MC's bring both intertwined
Bill: I agree, that's when the best of both worlds collide
When the realness pops off one time for your mind,
And your words cause the people in the crowd to riot

CHORUS
As many places I've been. As many people I've met
As many haters I've dissed. There's people that I respect
As many times as I've failed. As many times as I've won
As many lives as I touch. The dialogue has begun

Bill: I grew up on heavy metal and hip-hop
The energy was the same to me, it was insane to me
It made me want to rage against the machine
Pick up a guitar and scream into the mic like Run-DMC
Lars: Nine Inch Nails, Primus, “Weird Al,” and King Missile
Influenced me like a postmodern epistle
Geeked out on my Performa looping digital drums
Playing rock guitar in punk bands just for fun
Who's your favorite rapper? Bill: Rakim, G Rap and Kane
KRS, EPMD, NWA, Public Enemy, Shante and LL Cool J
I could keep naming MC's all day,
What type of metal stuff you listen to?
Lars: Old school Slayer CD's, Biohazard and
Bile were the bands for me
The first time that I ever heard Chuck D
Was the Anthrax CD, “Attack of the Killer B's”… chorus!

REPEAT CHORUS
Lars: So Bill, what's your take on censorship?
Politicians on a church/state fusion tip?
Bill: I speaks my mind while kids I went to high school with
Bleed on the sands of Kabul hit, it's bullshit,
Lars what you think of it?
Lars: Out in Iraq, a lack of dialogue
Between the people is whack!
Bill: In fact I speak militant like Black Panthers
These gas prices got my people
With seeds having to gank pampers
Lars: The answer is not plutocracy.
The answers is not hypocrisy,
The answers is true democracy
Bill: The answer is the dialogue constantly

Hand me a gram, shoot
Misunderstanded with the family man, shoot

I'm training in state boots
I hang with the same group
Aim at your grapefruit
The shit that you say cute?
I can't relate, duke
The trey pound's related to the ache in the face full
Nigga, I hate you, break you, Ivan Drago
I'm rushing to put pellets in your pecan pronto
P! Ain't talking money, we can't convo
You pussy under pressure, pa
P stand strong, though
I bring in the shells, I beat up your squad
You singing in jail, you Chico DeBarge
Fucking nickel bag steamers
I sell coke that's whiter than milk of magnesia
Frankenstein when I'm making mine
You think you rhyme, you should think of mine
Solomon Grundy

I made my bones shaving Sharon Stones in a school zone
One way ticket from the projects to a pool home
Trapping, balling, and rappin is the hoods holy trinity
I sold a pack 'fore I lost my virginity
Surrounded by speed freaks and weed geeks
Quiet down, listen up when g's speak
Return of the body catcher, the crown's been captured
Caught up in the rapture, I slaughtered a bunch of rappers
Ain't no Tarzan in the marshland
Fumes from the meth cook turn me into the swamp man
Get the red wine out
White lines in Amy Winehouse
Walk fine lines in hindsight
Coulda made some better choices
I didn't always have to listen to the voices
Thug in my bloodline, mud pies and drug buys
The dead live on and love dies
Solomon Grundy

Ill Bill murder futuristic like Paul Laffoley
Haul your casket away
Assassins'll spray
Reptilian like a cannibal's brain
Horrifying like dying in a two-passenger plane
Nosediving, fire in the sky, showers of flame
Houses of pain on cypress hills and mountainous terrain
Even a lion chills after an ounce of sour to the face
I'm the lightning that the Vikings worshipped
The sight of when a rifles bursting
Write subversive
I'm a decisive person
Liquor on a bullet wound, feel the Henny sting
Everything is everything
I'm a Heavy Metal King
Been labeled intelligent, irreverent, malevolent
True indeed, plus a veteran
On point like the Devil's chin
Surrounded by apparitions & statues of smiling death
Assassins with pistols capture your dying breath
Like you stepped into a horror flick
Kill you then resurrect you in the middle of a blizzard of hollow tips

Ill Lit,"I remember the day you said,
“'till death do us part,”
And I remember the day
I saw you die.
The road is what we get
And you went and got it started.
The way we would act when they
All held us back, and the time
We would spend with the others
Who laughed when we laughed...
(refrain)
These things we've imagined
Would take soft advantage
Of what quickly destroyed us
In asides of the night, well
They've returned with a vengeance
And they're demanding the answers
To the questions
That lock us in our lives.
(refrain)
I remember the accidents
We always called “accidents”.
I remember the way I learned to lie
Down with another type of child.
I still try and cover my eyes
Before the light can blind me,
Carelessly.

My rationale a stranger.
I grip my own conclusions,
Built up from my delusions.

Begin to tremble,
Frustration blooming,

Nothing can touch me.
For lack of more frustration
Or my reconciliation.

Thing that destroys me.

Red rain is coming down
Red rain
Red rain is pouring down
Pouring down all over me

I am standing up at the water's edge in my dream
I cannot make a single sound as you scream
It can't be that cold, the ground is still warm to touch
This place is so quiet sensing that storm

Red rain is coming down
Red rain
Red rain is pouring down
Pouring down all over me

Well I've seen them buried,
In a sheltered place in this town
They tell you that this rain can sting and look down
La sangre ne está and I see no sign of pain
Hey, no pain
Seeing no rojo, I see no rain

Red rain is coming down
Red rain
Red rain is pouring down
Pouring down all over me

Putting the pressure on much harder now
Restar again and again
Just let the red rain splash you
Let the rain fall on your skin
I've come to you defences down
With the trust of a child

Red rain is coming down
Red rain is coming down
Red rain is pouring down all over me
I'm begging you

Red rain is coming down all over me

You're everything
That's why I cling to you
When I emerge
My thoughts converge to you
To you

The world is so small
Compared to you
And everybody's wrong
Compared to you
To you

I begin to see through your eyes
All the former mysteries are no surprise
So now, you listen
'cause I'm omniscient

Hey look at me lady
I'm just a little baby
You're lucky to have me
I'm cute and sweet as candy

As charming as a fable
I'm innocent and disabled
So hug me and kiss me
Then wipe my butt and piss me

I hope you never leave
'cause who would hear me scream?
Nobody understands
Except the toys in my hands

So now you listen
'cause I'm omniscient

Hey look at me lady
I'm just a little baby
If I smile, then you smile
Then I'll get mad for awhile

I melt in your mouth
And in your hands whenever I can
But I really do nothing
Except kickin' and fussin'

I like to make a mess
I laugh at your distress
I sit all day in my crib
Absorbing all you give

I'm helpless
I'm flawless
I'm a machine

Give me
I need my toys

Keep me hot
Keep me strong
Keep me everlong

So now you listen
'cause I'm omniscient

You better pray your crew is with you
You better fucking pray I don't find you alive

It's the end of all that you know
Your world is over
Your soul goes under
You better pray I don't find you alive
Pray
Pray I don't find you alive

You better pray I don't find you

The earth moves all the ground beneath me
In throws glasses off the shelf
I guess I've come to one conclusion
That all this planet's not for sale
The old man calling out to find you
He lost his children in this hell
The day is black the lights are over
And soon everything will be still

Pray
Pray
You better pray I don't find you alive
Pray, it's over
Pray, goes under
You better pray I don't find you alive

Lámela hasta que grite ""dámela"", y empieza a entender de qué se trata la vida

Me muestra su volcan, su lava, su saliva
Me abre su puerta de entrada, no de salida

El sol se fue, se fue de aquí 
Se fue de fuego no lo sentí 
Yo me quede sobre el país 
Para morir y revivir 

Allá en Barranca, en San Miguel, 
O sobre el barro de Pudahuel 
Entre los pasos del hombre fiel 
Una y mil veces, me volveré, me volveré 
Me volveré, me volveré, me volveré 

Canción de ayer, canción de hoy 
Que va golpeando a mi población 
Antigua y cruel como el dolor 
Del hambre frío de la nación 

Pues un patriota, un gran señor 
Me está apuntando en el corazón, 
Para tildarme de Juan traidor 
Y yo soy flor tan solo flor, 
Tan solo flor, tan solo flor 

Me hice flor de un color 
En el silencio de mi temor 
Y me junté y fuimos dos 
Y como piedra ya somos diez, 
Porque en el fondo del corazón 
Que nos abraza con su calor 
Hay un futuro partido en dos 
De libertad, de amor, de amor 
Y amor de amor y amor de amor 

De andar y andar por el amor 
Me fui adentrando en su corazón 
Y en el fragor de decir no 
De nuevo veo que sale el sol 

Y gota a gota puede el sudor 
Armar de pronto la gran canción 
Que todo el pueblo como una voz 
En la alameda ya lo entonó, 
Liberación, liberación 

El sol se fue, se fue de aquí 
Se fue de fuego no lo sentí

Amigo, amigo, amigo

Donde estás amor te espero 
Sé que nunca llegarás

Si tú eres quien no duerme 
Si se apagó tu alegría 
Y un mar sereno te conforma 

Por qué 
Te horrorizas cuando hablo 
Que el condón es necesario 
O llego un poco mareado 
Por qué 
Me condenas por mis años 
A vivir encapsulado 
Y sospechas de antemano 
Por qué no puedo 
Ser joven y alocado 
Sin terminar encarcelado 
Y la moral como jurado

Sin infiernos como pago

Temper rises paper thin
Evil lurks in every vein

See the evil in my eyes

What went wrong in my life

You see me walking still sane
But in the dark I feel

Hell
I see the demons dance in vein
They're quite used to that

High powers led me to this maze
Evil took the time to set me up with fate

And my emotions try to rest for a while but in a second I'll be gone

Was a game I played so right

Try, feel - see things through my eyes
You - you made this hell, you really did
This is why I fell - when you

Screamed at my wrongs
Your yelling didn't succeed
In time all you gave
Was a game that tied my feet

Wish my life had just turned out
Better - but my weak is strong

So - will you stay there forever?
All in your grief? I bet you will
Or will you pull it together?
Is it a lie? I bet you can

Come on your fool, lets do it

I wish I could just let it go
But to do that would be hard
My friends will never ever know
How much I try for my part

It's you against the world
Or you against yourself

Not a tall guy, a small fry
Yo I'm all live, making more noise than a .45
And I'm naughty, far from corny
Got game for the shorties, tackle skins like a 40
Plus I got the hyper rhymes
When you say ""Lord Finesse"" yo brothers know I'm nice with mine
I be around like a time zone
Mess around get your mind blown, I'm brighter than rhinestones
And when I roll like an avalanche
Even Ray Charles can see clown rappers don't have a chance
I grab the mic and start acting ill
Yo I'm strapped to kill, all the brothers with no rapping skills
Throw away mt shoes, they don't fit ya, get the picture?
Yo check it out, while I hit you with the

[A.G.]
You're a fake hip-hopper trying to ruin it
See other brothers doing it
So now you want to put your little two in it
Playing games, I'm a start saying names
For selling rap's a trap, for the money, honey, the fame
Won't flip-flip, yes I'm on a hip-hop hooray tip
Crabs better lay quick, or get your face split
Bass lines be burying, your beats are hurry-hurry
Show beats is cream, the meanest team never worry
Picasso with a mic so watch me paint, G
And if my boots don't have a tree then it ain't me
See I was raised in the ghetto, seen everything you could imagine
>From robbing to stealing, looting, shooting, and the stabbing
Chill around the way I can't refuse it, I choose it
And maintain the pain and use it in my music
What I'm saying is hip-hop comes from way back
From childhood to manhood then comes the fat track
Showbiz & A.G., massive wreck we catch
From Dallas, Tex, to T-Next, then I'm back to the BX
Record on record, showstoppers don't knock us
And give out propers to the real hip-hoppers
Brand Nubians, Grand Puba, and BDP
The Hit Squad, the Lench Mob, the Flavor you-N-I-T
Greg Nice, Smooth B, Tribe Called Quest, Killa G
GangStarr, Ice Cube, of course D.I.T.C.
The whole flavor tour of 19 Naughty 3

1 to the 2 to the 3 (On the M-I-see!) [Repeat: x4]

[Malik]
Next up to flex, snapping necks, catching wreck
When I finish this flow, you'll regret that threat
Kicking rhymes at all times, with my brothers from the North
Never see me slipping, always ripping as they're falling off
Don't sleep on me or try to eat me up
Cause I'm raw, real rough and rugged rhymes on the regular
Where's your girl? Hold up, she's screaming cause I'm sticking her
Making this game come down, outta the hype
I got a call from Redman, he says ""Tonight's Da Night""
So Finesse bring the fat track and I'm sure to rock it
I'm living for hip-hop, I'm killing because of hip-hop
You can't write your own hits, get get stopped in hip-hop
Or drop, giving your rocks, sinking shots, off your feet
Cause the L-I-L M-A-L-I-K can't be beat
And A-B-C, ha, is easy as 1-2-3, yeah
As soon as the Lord on the beat, I couldn't even speak
Just wrote all night, so I can rip the mic
Like this and like that, and I never will come wack
So peace to A.U. and I'm out like that, it goes

With Erick Sermon, takin' over in the 90's, 
You knowhat I'msayin?
E-Double on the solo tip
And this how we gonna do it
We gettin' buzy on this track
Aye yo, check it
Do ya like this

Malik'll play the lawnmower, and Kris'll play the grass
I just ate MC's, 'cause why? ABC whipped!
Illegal cuts that ass, the way that I will punch you
Wouldn't think I was a kid G, that's why I took the time out
To say that I gets buzy, like Dizzy, Gillespie
So suckers stretch your eyes, but you still couldn't see me
Now, skippidy-doo-dah, di-di-di da-di-day
I don't need no permission, I still come out and play
To Uncle Sam I say, ""Scram!"" Say my numbers aren't enough
But to get wreck with the army, all I have to be is rough
And tough, and no need to lie about my age
Just get fly with my tongue, and go on a rampage
I'm going off, because it's Little Malik
And no sucker, it's not all about maturity
Now if you want beef, fuck it, 'cause a fuss
And no, little kids, this ain't nothin' for Da Youngsta's
Ya can't even see me
It's no relation, so we can't run in the family
Yeah, and I'm still the boss
Cause I'm a straight up nigga, ain't nothin' bout me Kris Kross 
 you little rejects
I have the intellect to get respect, I'm gettin' wreck
Don't even try to scam, because you're no threat to me

I'm not a ordinary kid it's the Illegal shit G
And with Malik, my shit'll be pumpin, you're punkin
You step out ?like the fuck in it? just like a pumpkin
Swingin' bolos, and buckin' buckshots
So when you look in the mirror, it be Illegal on your knots
So my advice to you is fade, stay out my way
Cause I'm a young bull on a rampage, I don't play
Jam that was a dope fiend, my rhymes and crews are fat
Check out my rhymes, and now check my gat
Because I'm always strapped pack with a loaded rhyme
And steppin' niggas get knocked off, from here to Zimbabwe, out
Cause I ain't havin' that shit, in ninety-three
Cause if you fuck with this shit, you gotta fuck with Malik, uh-huh
You call me pussy, come and play you get fucked
But if your bitches is burned, I call her shit out of luck

I'm swifter than Flash when I'll be cracking that black ass
Like this, my style's mackadocious
And rumpshaking, like the bumba claat Jamaican
Who can see me? My rap format is cock diesel
When I be rockin with Illegal
It Smells Like Teen Spirit, but not Nirvana's

Trink lieber kräftig Dosenbier,denn Dosenbier macht schlau.

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Illogic," 

[Illogic]
I stand in the belly of oblivion
seeing light strobe past me, at uncomparable speeds of rushing wind
I take a step towards the laboreth of life
where it's pearly gates of white perplex me
I enter its doors of glittering ivory
and was met by streets of gleeming gold
that seem to lead into infinity
curious I took the road to an unknown destination
endured my down down the street of precious metal
with thoughts of confusion racing though my metnal
nevertheless I continued the journey
looking around I noticed crowds of clouds floating through this abyss of
beauty as if it were home
alone I proceed to watch for any signs of life
any signs that might give me a sense of my surroundings
then off in the distance I notice a glowing white figure
it would appear to be a platinum fountain gathering drink to her lips
as I pulled closer to this vision a set of wings grabbed my attention
to get closer, I had to, to check if this being was reality
the nearer I got, the realer she became
with flowing curly hair of a brownish brunette and
I take it she felt my presence as she turned my direction
aqua green eyes locked to mine
as the sites of a crossbow with its target
centuries of thoughts, epics of words were exchanged in this blare
stare is all that came to mind
at a loss of speech I, was standing in amazement

now is it possible that she, is it possible that we
is it possible that me, her, us, is inevitable
confrontation amazing, incredible, fabolous
though I'm human, her angelic
(if it wasn't love I wouldn't of felt it)

but its definietly love at second glance but first sight
definietly love at second glance but first sight
definietly love at second glance but first sight
definietly love at first sight

her left appendix was extended to grace my face with the presence of her skin
the texture of her touch though of silk spun in the depths of Asia
her lips plump and sweet this being completely beautiful
from the root of her hair to the soul of her pedicure
still my muscles were stagnant(inactive)
I still handn't moved from the initial eyes locking so I appeared passive
shocking fact of how attractive being of the next world
to often I had to press girls to give me second look
but now I'm taken it was as if she saw into my soul and I, her's
its complexity had me perturbed(disturbed) that soceity's acceptance of her and I
but it seemed God was okay with it, he let our paths cross
still at a loss of words I strechd my arms just to touch her robe
to my knees I tossed, my body to worship this goddess of my resurrection
she had to be the closest thing to next to God himself
love like this never experienced before or ever will be again
she's my friend that shield me from the pain and anguish of living
never exchanged the word, our thoughts were from
the ""hello""'s to the ""how are you""'s to the ""I love you""'s
she grabbed my hands, led me to the land of milk and honey
life and prosperity, my wife she was preparing to be
we sat in a garden of roses and other, exotic flowers
still just exchanging thoughts as butterfly's landed on the tips of our noses
we held hands, her beauty was overwhelming I couldn't stand to stare
so I close my elids to rest of it
still she was there, I felt her gental touch to the chest
this heavenly voice spoke those three words, my heart began to race faster
felt the touch of those lips on my cheek, open my eyes to complete darkness
went for the lightswitch for illumination
wondering what type of twist or turn took my situation
to my surprise I was met by those eyes and that hair that stare, no wings
but it wasn't a dream, it was you my love
my earth angel, the real thing the real thing

I know now that she, I know now that we, me, her, us, in inevitable
confrontation amazing, incredible, fabolous
though I'm human, her angelic
if it wasn't love I wouldn't of felt it
but its definietly love at second glance but first sight
definietly love at second glance but first sight
definietly love at second glance but first sight
definietly love at first sight",Angel,2000
Illogic,"Yo yo yo
What I want you to do on this one Illogic is
Show all these people, what kind of styles you got
'Cause the true test, of any MC, is his versatility
So get on this mic, and show these heads what you got
Yeah

Yo, yo, so you want to try battlin'?
I know time will tell my prime but I paddle time for tattlin'
I'm on some, kind of, time to, hypnotize a hypnotist
Verbally you're vaginal
Take this stiff mic and split your lips
Lyrically I'm picturesque and you're not photogenic
My shadow gets tripped up tryin' to mimic
In memory mention me mentally, starvin' put simplistically
Pardon but waitin' for you my mind would malnourish
While my style flourish, try not to bother it
'Cause with your intellect
You couldn't stay atop your flow with a scholarship
Holla if, ya hearin' this, conceal I'm revealin' gets
you higher than heaven so then it's now an execution
You feelin' this?

It's Illogic on the mic, check it out y'all

Purified skill I demonstrate as the wack is eliminated
I could cum off with a vasectomy and you struggle masturbatin'
For this rendition I need some competition
Some type of challenger cause I smash, melons like Gallagher
With strength you're weak/week like one line of a calendar
Amateur, here's a warning, I keep it live, and you're snorin'
I'm so hot my conception was the initials stages of global warmin'
Stormin' kids, typhoon-like when the mic ignites I strike tykes
That take flight to lights of elevated height, cloggin' pipes up when
Bend men on the regular, sever ya, flavor ya lactates
You to beatin' me has the probability of lightning striking
Three times in the same place, but I make haste
'Cause I'm destined for great things like the fetus of Jesus
With wisdom I confuse the color schemes of prisms
I manipulate mics like the Nation of Islam to attack men
And leave whack men endangered like the species of black men
I'm on the prowl and, usually disembowelin' my attacker
And for some reason I got this habit of chain-smokin' rappers

Mr. Dibbs in the house, check it out y'all
Signify in the house, check it out y'all
G. Fresh in the place, check it out y'all
Apple G., check it out, check it out, check it out y'all

At times, my metaphors are hard for me to catch and I threw 'em
Heads I flew 'em ran through 'em with the quickness
Synaptic shutdown, what noun can haunt the pronoun for progressing?
So aesthetically profound, I got nuns undressing
Let's slow down, impossible cut throttle to light speed
This ya gotta see facts spittin' so sick I'll need a colostomy bag
Resistance is too foul, I'm advancin' hands when raps adapt
I'm so dope and you're so whack
You now defy the law that opposites attract
Herb you don't got the nerve to test me
'Cause my mind is so quick
You'd think my thoughts are goin' the speed of sound on a jet ski
You're rockin' name brands but you don't impress me
If I was your breath, while takin' a rest, you couldn't catch me
Respect me you're gettin' cancelled like Matlock
Cut short like a half-top
Stop, I told ya now I gotta fold ya like a laptop
You wonder why you can't get me it's cause you're not thinkin'
'Cause yo I flip more styles 
Than a couch potato flips channels in a weekend

Illogic,"[Blueprint]
My favorite things include hip-hop crowds that ain't biased
Seein heads participate in real rhyme cyphers
Open mics with nobody spittin a written
Original MC's that love being different

[Illogic]
My favorite things include, open minds to open mics
and when I get open from rhymes that strike
Creativity's a plus, plus an MC that can crush without a cuss
and it's nice when a DOPE chick bust

[Blueprint]
My favorite is be	-girls that pop and lock
They're able to rock the spot, passers by that stop and jock
Cats that come to a hip-hop spot
without feelin the need to cop a glock and lick shots

[Illogic]
When a true MC spits raps composed of delicate prose on tracks
and when it's felt by the masses
Platinum respect lackin blunt ashes
Battle clashes from the top to drop any approachin amateur
When a challenger's up to caliber

[Blueprint]
MC's that shine without boastin
MC's that rhyme with the motion
Elevation without the high-postin
MC's that never lose touch and do they own street promotion

[Illogic]
When an MC's spirituality is the point focal
Minds bi-coastal, expandin beyond the local
And when I'm chillin with the pen and pad, fillin the lab with vocals
of melodic tunes that, reak of the underground perfume

[Blueprint]
When somebody I don't know gives me compliments
Seeing humbleness replace overconfidence
Hearin MC's that rap about the consequence
instead of glorifyin a lifestyle that lacks any type of common sense

[Illogic]
The lack of wack rhyme writin, and rhyme bitin
The ignitin of flames that fuel innovation
Tappin into the realm of concentration
to where the listener feels he's hopped dimension
Lyrics to make aliens stop and listen

[Blueprint]
The absence of yellin on my mixtapes
Any additional loops in my milk crates
Record shops where I cop all my beat breaks
Recordin every one of my verses on the very first take

[Illogic]
When the loop speed doesn't exceed 90
And to catch a line an MC must rewind me
To know my mom's behind me
That I make this my art, my culture, my release
My outlet by means through which I reveal the beast

[Blueprint]
When my EPS doesn't overheat
Rebootin and not lose an entire beat
When somebody want to diss or underrate me
I know this sounds strange, but it motivates me

[Illogic]
Stereo-stereotypes crushed, the shatter of grey matter
Clutch the mic 'til it rust
When an +Unforeseen+ kid bust
In wild styles to thrust thoughts like rapids to rush

[**both**]
These are a few of our favorite things in hip-hop

I don't know what you thought you had or what you got
But yo, to be an MC it takes a lot
Are you willin to take the responsibility of this quest
cause if you do it right you might not have nothin left

[Illogic]
Yo, it takes artistic ability and knowhow lyrically
to express in forms of poetical wizardry
It takes rhythmic structures and phenomenal thoughts
It takes creation of hooks on which the wack can get caught
It takes knowledge of self and creator
It takes payin attention to that music in the elevator and elevatin
If you call yourself a lyrical surgeon it takes patients/patience
It takes takin a trip with God on that ship of relation
It takes self-denial AND realization
It takes keepin it realistic
Not real just to become a statistic
It takes evolution and edification
It takes a person, it takes a family, takes a city, it takes a nation
It takes surroundin sound, not lettin sound surround you
It takes surroundin yourself with fam and a dope crew
It takes hot tracks and it takes hot use of words
I don't about you but for me it took a third

[Chorus] - 2X

[Illogic]
Yo, it takes a sense of focus and clear mindstate
It takes shape and destiny and acceptin fate
It takes you takin a stand and not conceit
It takes you bein and actin like a man and not a beast
It takes squashin beef
It takes, treating our women like queens and men like kings
It takes replacement of material with spiritual things
It takes a one for education and lack of stupidity
It takes discovering your faults and seeking a remedy
It takes some illogical thinking in this rational world
It takes passiveness and confontation, rebellion and confirmation
It takes, an open and a closed mind
It takes a lack of compromise and, findin some truth in lies
It takes healin, it takes booze and it takes tryin
It takes winnin, it takes losin, it takes livin , it takes dyin
It takes them, it takes us, it takes you what takes me
These are the essentials I think it takes to be an MC

[Chorus] - 2X

[Illogic]
I'm an MC cause I got what it takes
Are you an MC, do you have what it takes?
If you don't know, I've defined it
So go ahead kid, and just rewind it
I'm an MC cause I got what it takes
Are you an MC, do you have what it takes?
If you don't know, I've defined it
So go ahead kid, and just rewind it

Illrd Tyme Out,"The highway sign said the georgia line
Was twenty miles away 
So I thought I'd take a detour
And see the old home place
I could have found my way
With my eyes closed and in the dark
This ol' dirt road ain't on no map
I know the way by heart

And the house still looks the same
Though the name on that ol' mailbox has been changed
And a tractor turns the earth 
That my daddy and a mule had plowed up first
As the memories return and my eyes begin to burn
This ol' place has new faces in the fields

The rockin' chairs on the front porch
Move from a sudden wind
It's almost like my mom and dad 
Were sittin' there again
I hear my brother callin' from
His favorite climbin' tree
But I'm just hearin' echos
Of how it used to be

For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do

To etch and mold a dream
Which soon became a passing game

And stretched his willing gentle hand
To seek the help, to shape the life
He had depended on
Which fell like rain and snow

For several instruments or more

Yeah
She gotta work out a play 'fore
She bail on her day job 'cause bae got
New orders to wait on
New Yorkers and ASOS
Spent years on her plans to ditch a plan
One spark went inside the avalanche
Whole world out there, she set to span
You can tell that by the Instagram
You gonna run the world someday
But someday can wait, it's not today

Haven't tuned in to the blow by blow
She move, I move, let her go, I go
Stir it up, stand back, watch a firework show

Too in denial to admit when it's over
Drown in the separate ends of an ocean
Both in too deep to know where the coast is
Surrounded by waves and the hurricanes

Then it's RIP to the other days

You play with fire, your bridges get burnt, man
Standoff, only making this worse
But don't nobody move and nobody gets hurt, man

Bad habits, don't knock it 'til you try it
Look up for ourselves from a mirror
You know me, I'm down for whatever
And I'm so far gone, feels so right
Seems wrong? Sure, but you want what you want
Rooms full of empty bottles and rolled notes
I'ma do this 'til I'm gone, I'm gone broke, now
Liquor in the system (woo) let's get it
Hotel room like a typhoon hit it
I'm living this life whether highs or religious
And goodbyes are love letters, written in her lipstick
Sitting on the fence won't get you both sides
Heaven ain't far, it's a hell of a night
It's whatever you like, we can go or go in
Burn a candle both ends until you say when

Ain't no emoji for the feeling
Let 'em autocorrect that
I didn't mean to throw you in the deep end

Shit, I don't have fortune or a fast car
But I got an escape plan and a map
The Clyde to your Bonnie, wake up smell the coffee
Not exactly Vodka and Cottees, but obviously
Fucking with the fly shit, you're meant to indulge
In my element, right, making memories roll
Y'all know, make the kind, either never gets told
I tell 'em all the time and they never get old
You my sidekick, my highness, yeah what's good?
Fuck the fine print, write this in the books

Illy,"Seems like we grew up in a world
Where marketing's the reason you sell
So everybody's got a story
Or achievments to tell
These days seems everyone's repeating themselves
I'd change it but in truth it can't really be helped
Because what you about to do
Has been done one hundred times
Before you had thunk it
From Melbourne to London
Produces made beats before you could spell drumkits
Really how unique can you be I mean c'mon kid?
From the days of record stores
To the days of online message boards
It's all been said before
For ages I'd have sought inspiration
To create the same place where now you draw yours from
But your aim's to paint an image
But I know you ain't breaking limits
With the same (same) but different
It's like South Park when the Simpsons did it
I try to be one of a kind with my lyrics, but

Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you've heard this all before
I'm only one voice in a world of billions
And no idea's original no more
Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you've heard this all before
I'm only one voice in a world of billions
And no idea's original no more

Right I'm feeling like Jay
What more can I say
Only two albums deep
Like a quarter of the way
To the finish line
Some claim kick back give it time
Other's like hustle harder it'll slip by
So here it is
Conscious to the fact that the rhymes that I spat
In past times just might overlap
If they do dig deep and cope with that
Repetition is the father of learning
You're dead if you don't adapt
And I built it I'mma about it so I'mma still rep proud
Stick to my guns like the building's surounded
And bring the house down till they're kicking me out of it
Still have the freshest shit out on each album
Cause it's true no idea's original right
But a different perspective can give a new light
So I pull the pen out now I'm giving you mine
It's for you to press play sit back in the saab

Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you've heard this all before
I'm only one voice in a world of billions
And no idea's original no more
Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you've heard this all before
I'm only one voice in a world of billions
And no idea's original no more

I know you've heard this before
(One, two, three, four, four, three, two, one)

One mic
Two mic
Three mic
Four check it
Fine line between fine mic and broken records
Between recognising flaws and applause
Let's see what shit I can't tackle anymore
No momentary happiness or footprints in the sand
No pedal to the metal chase or cigarettes in hand
All good I'll get by
But I hope you understand
The same values I had
Still define who I am
I'm a hip hop boy
Leave the dubstep to club heads
I loose my shit to it
But ain't rapped on it once yet
It ain't me
Trends come and go
But at the time it got known
I'd already out grown it
I guess what I've learnt is my golden rule
Is the only thing that matters is the fans
That's who made this possible for me
So I'm responsible for you
It might not be the new
But nothing can beat truth

Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you've heard this all before
I'm only one voice in a world of billions
And no idea's original no more
Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you've heard this all before
I'm only one voice, ya I'm only one voice
But that voice speaks up for yours

Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you've heard this all before
Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you've heard this all before

Illy,"Yeah, now, I don't mean to brag but
I'm a big city kid
Gone with the wind
Shoot from the hip
And all across the world, no difference
Every city in the world, at home within
Man, it could be nothing like the hard life
Shit, still a sucker for a skyline
The open road's fine to write a couple of lines
But the cities tell the story of a lifetime
Cut. Lights, camera, action
It's all that, everything you imagine
It's right there, you can reach out and grab it
Dreams turn reality big smoke magic
Maybe I'm biased, it may be the set up
Maybe it's just that I don't know no better
City don't sleep, speakers at eleven
If they got a question this is what I tell them (them, them, them)

Them city streets are endless
Them bright lights catch the eye
We push it to the limit
We build it to the sky
And anything can happen
So you do roll the dice
Hold tight and get ready to ride

I'm home, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight
Said, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight

Yeah, you could live the dream
Have it fall in your lap
Fall in love or fall through the cracks
Tough call to avoid those traps
But in high-stakes business you gonna get that
Take it from the streets to the penthouse suites
All you need is a dream, a belief
A little luck and a bit of guts to achieve
Heart of the city, belly of the beast
Yeah, what you pay for, cheap thrills ain't cheap
Pay a high price if you wanna taste free
All the good isn't always what it seems
But that's fine with me, this is where I wanna be
Amongst the bright lights and the beat of the city
In any direction people are with me
We get busy, what a trip, what a blessing
They wanna question so I tell them (them, them, them)

Them city streets are endless
Them bright lights catch the eye
We push it to the limit
We build it to the sky
And anything can happen
It's on you to roll the dice
Hold tight and get ready to ride

I'm home, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight
Said, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight
I'm home, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight
Said, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight

I'mma stay hard 'till the sun goes down
'Till the lights come out
'Till the lights go down
And the sun comes up again
I'mma stay hard 'till the sun goes down
'Till the lights come out
'Till the lights go down
And the sun comes up again
I'mma stay hard 'till the sun goes down
'Till the lights come out
'Till the lights go down
And the sun comes up again
I'mma stay hard 'till the sun goes down
'Till the lights come out
'Till the lights go down
And the sun comes up again

I was told a strong heart topples kings
And that hope spring's eternal

Then they fight you, and then you win

She was like what you want me to choose?
I was like well I didn't say that, but you know
Help me help you
I'm on the balance beam to keep you happy
Or say fuck it, stay mad at me
Know how that goes, drink, fight, patch things up in the back of a taxi
She can skate thin ice on wheels and not once get wet
She could walk five miles in heels not one foot out of step
And I swear I'll leave you swept, off your feet it's just our guess
I'm falling hard on myself here, yeah over my head

It's like I'm walking on a tightrope
And every step could be the one where I fall
It's like I'm running with a blindfold
And I could be wrong but I don't know, I don't know!

Headed for the deep end, Thursday we fight and forget it by the weekend
Fast learner, I figured out quick
With her it's not the getting it's the keeping
'Cause she's a gem, so everyone wants her shinning with them
Gettin' my bulldog on bro
Mind your step, keep it on your side of the fence
I play my demo's one last once
Smile if she likes it, laugh if it sucks!
Cold blooded, she the first in my corner
But now, what's that if it ain't called love
When it's all said and done, baby and happy 'till my heads spun
So I might get lucky
I might get none
Like I'm right back at square one!

Te dejo alas sin balas 
Que tus palabras sean la entrada al Klama Hama 
Brothas esperan tu llegada 
Pintan el sendero con suero 
Hoy las lágrimas no se movieron 
Casi desaparecieron
Expedición al Klama Hama 
Hey hermano, hey hermana 
No dejes de respirar 

Oculta la selva bajo nuestro umbral 
Ya no quiero mas gritar 
De la superficie quiero despegar
Esta fortaleza ya no ama a nadie 
Nadie es quien engañe, nadie que me dañe 
Y es inutil que entretrenes tus trenes 
Aquí no tienen vía 
He visto a los leones cuidando nuestras vidas 
Te equivocas ante la mirada de la saga 
Tu golpe poco directo no hace nada nada 
Como Chow Yun Fat mi cabeza chiva 

Tengo el estilo, la técnica para darte caída 
Cuando estés en el suelo 
Te brindaré la mano y un sueño 
Y si no eres leal 
Mil dragones pateando tu cuerpo 
Sabe, mi dolor es clandestino 
Como el contrato del cielo y el infierno 
Esta es la leyenda del tigre y el dragón 
Expedición al Klama Hama 
Hey hermano, hey hermana 

Mujer que me acompañas por las aguas del reloj 
Visión que me transporta riéndose del sol 
Pido perdón si asesino mis ánimos 
Hoy es el día herida, perdida está mi voz 
Amigo lento y velóz 
Sucede que despierto y lejos 
Y acompaño el manjar junto al arroz 
La cena se incendia día a día 
Solo alimenta las desnutridas almas sin vida 

Librarás a las manos que quieren llegar 
Al lugar donde el agua se puede besar 
Oirás, las palabras se fueron de allí 
Soñarás con un día poder despertar 
Caminar, encontrarte con la humanidad
Lloraras, por lo que has visto y lo que verás 
Mas allá, escuchaste a un niño callar 
En su voz el recuerdo de lo que paso",Expedicion Al Klama Hama,1998
Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas,"Protégeme del estallido, baby 
O si no introdúceme en él 
Somos planetas que derriten todo 
Y te inundan de placer 

Seré el desertor, me puedes besar 
Entra a mi palacio, prueba esta delicia 
Ábreme tu cama, ábreme tu estrella 

Y yo me esconderé y tú me buscarás 
Si no lo haces bien me puedes lastimar 
Y la lengua del sol será mi tobogán 
Te olvidas que sangro en el espacio 
Y yo me esconderé y tú me buscarás 
Te prometo volver si sabes dónde estar 
Se ahoga el dolor con la velocidad 
Respira, ésto es Da Cosmos 

Complétame el alma con un bosque 
Y librame, la celda morirá 
Atardecer en el clímax de esta noche 
Abrázame, descubrirás qué lejos estás 

Soy el desertor de todo este mal 
La vida no confluye, desnuda tus ataques 
Adora mi perfume y descansa en 
Esta hoguera 

Mira que todo está quieto 
Mira que el sol está quieto 
Y buscas la venganza, sufres la venganza 
La muerte este allí tan lejos de aquí 
Ven hacia mí 

Romántica versión del universo 
Será tener tu orgasmo sobre mí 
Ayer choqué con tu bendita trampa 
Lágrima y luz, me queda algo de ti 

Soy el desertor, te puedo besar

Te propongo salir a transpirar 

Nadar es un sueño 
Si el mar es de acero 
Si mirás al pasar 
Verás que el mundo se está 
Demoliendo, baby, baby 

Alucina la cascada virtual 
Catarata invisible inundando tu lugar 
El vapor de tus sueños tiene gusto a miel 
Demolamos la frontera que separa 
Nuestra piel

Crossing through the dimensions 
Like a bird made out of light 
Smiling after the honey 
Crying at this fire burning out my soul 
Sweet and wet and wet and sweet 

Vi que volabas más allá 
Planeabas ser dueña de mi ilusión 
Hamacándote en el nirvana 
Cercano a Dios 
No podrás imaginar 
A lo que llamo lago emocional 
Las aguas que bañan estrellas 
Besan la ciudad 
Y yo estoy esperando que el sol 
Venga a mí 
Y me lleve hacia tí amor

Alto, alto y más alto 
Ubica el cielo, será el lugar 
Alto, alto y más alto 
Se encuentra el Cosmos 
Quiero llegar 

El alfabeto que está 
Saliendo de tu boca no está mal 
Mientras que pronuncias que deseas 
Mi puerta derribar
Sé que quieres vislumbrar 
A lo que llamo cine y humedad 
Sumérgete en la pantalla
Comienza a gozar 
Pues yo estoy actuando para vos 
Y quiero ser tu príncipe y ladrón, mi amor

Muéstramelo, mata el dolor 
Llámame Dios 
Haré que sientas lo de ayer 
Electrificaré tus piernas
Con tu placer, haré llover, eh eh 
Sobre los campos donde las 
Estrellas 
Logran lo fugaz

Puede que de ésto entiendas otra cosa 
Porque en esta clicka somos todos invisibles 
Si no me encuentras ahora, te fuiste 
The guacho no es gaucho, él quiere mi caucho 
Extingo al puto, me quedo su auto 
Subo el stereo, el volumen está bien alto 
Ahora prepárate para un mental asalto 
Nadie va a tocar la vida mía

No hay sol en tu alma y el dinero no alcanza 

Hey mero mero, you are waiting for culero 
Pero tú eres un yuta y no eres verdadero 
Escucha el tic tac que destina tu destino 
Porque los perros de la calle no te quieren de vecino 
Mi culonita linda mueve su cadera 
Dentro de esta dicka hay karate y destreza 
Big ass puto no eres la promesa 
La verdad tiene ritmo, siente la realeza 
Tiene sentido lo que digo, si no entendiste te

A klamsta hamsta klamsta 
Basta de pelear desde un pedestal, yo huyo de un cubo 
Afectado a la vida, desarmo tu magia no 
Plasmas tu herida 
Y en la selva de todo el oro abandono 
Y te hundes sonriendo en un barco de piernas 
Ahogadas, quebradas, huyendo en la nada 
Espero que entiendas, tu clicka acelera 
Y toma en tu lago tu ansiada belleza 
Estoy en Urquiza con mi amigo Aníbal 
Y te vemos pensando lo que harás con tu vida 
Se nota en tus ojos que vas por mal trecho 
Y vas a terminar con una bala en el pecho

No es la solución ni la puerta, mantente cerca 
La violencia esclava de las almas sin albas 
Conoce las razones por lo que sangra una espada 
Hay un hangar es un lugar donde despertar 
Hoy no quiere estar, es solo la fusión 
Entre el bien y el mal 
Que me hace sembrar este cascabel 
Y observar como nace el infierno en la piel 
En mi mente no ejecuto juicio 
Solo soy real, combato el precipicio 
Nunca volverán a la Dorada era 
Una dimensión ajena hoy será mi lengua

Mi estilo es distinto al tuyo 
No observas la humedad porque no habla 
Siéntate y escucha quien te habla 
Vacío está el refugio donde se esconden las almas

Caen los imperios este día, cae una bomba, muere la energía 
Se dice que está el cielo y el infierno 
El cielo lo vemos arriba, el infierno lo vivimos día a día 
Encuentra los oídos del delirio 
Que escoltan al viajero que ha perdido su destino 
Por la noche que ha guiado al tren negro

Ya no habrá mas guerra, ya no habrá mas nada 
Cae otra bomba, esta es mi palabra 
Abre tu pechera, entrégate de alma

Tengo la llave, trata de no morir 
Te pasaré a buscar por la puerta del fin 
No me vengas a decir que la vida es así 
No me conoces a mí 
Ni a los días que he escondido en mi alma 
Únete despacio a mí, que el destino lo quiso así 
Marcaremos el camino con un rastro divino 
Nos veremos caer donde no hay principio, 
El fin del precipicio rojo es el cielo que anuncia el sacrificio 
Donde el miedo convierte la fuerza en un vicio 
Donde la luz es líquida y me provee de juicio 
Para salir quebrando al policía que nunca quiso 
Que fuera el paraíso y la tierra un mismo sitio 
Que mi secreto sea tu escape de este mundo ignorante 
Donde se proyecta por la muerte y no la vida 
En mi trono visualizo la belleza derretida

Tiene aeropuerto en mi galaxia 
Y busco la familia de cometas

En la noche, a la distancia 
Pues la guerra de lactancias 
Ha llegado al fin desde tu arribo a esta galaxia

Dame tu salto, yo lo iluminaré

Con eso yo construí un gran puente 
Para pasar pal otro lado e las serpientes 

Mi nombre e cool ero connor 
Soy cruza de potrillo y de perra 
Cuando camino por las calles de mi barrio 
Hago sabe que mi ser es un calvario 
Estoy alerta de lo que haces 
Cuando te muevas es mejor que no te atrases 
Soy groova chaco, be careful vato 
No te hagas el macho con mis palabras te machaco 

Hazte a un lado que voy rumbo a tu tierra 
Como Valderrama le meto gol a tus perras 
Ya lo sabes, ahora me imploras 
Después querrás beber de mi cantimplora 
Te digo y te repito conmigo no te metas 
Mi clica esta creciendo alrededor del planeta 

Abarajame en la bañera 
Abarajame en la bañera, nena 

Be cool don’t be culo man chico boludo 
Todos tus chumbos metetelo en el culo 
You know about me, you know about mi cara 

Te importan los pibes que aspiran pegamento 
Cuando ellos crezcan comeras el pavimento 
Yo aspiro a la paz, tu aspiras de la otra 
Saquéame la dicka sin tu tropa 

Abarajame en la bañera 
Abarajame en la bañera, nena 
You tought about the time 
Uncame the clama hama 
A friend without head 
Que no quiere ser nada 
Tu sabes que es humo 
Que se cuide de los azules 
Sino terminara siendo un portero de hule 
Yo le dije a pedro, you are latino brotha 
De careful of pigs, they are trying to be badder 
El no me hizo caso y se fumo un perro 
Un ovejero yuta de un dueño hijo de puta 
Pedro murió de ocho tiros policiales 
Según la ley ocho tiros legales

Es la clicka que tu alma inunda

Tengo un terreno en la realeza 
Tengo la gloria, no he besado a la reina

No aspiro a ser esclavo de esa mierda 
Juro que nunca he comido un ladrillo

Yo simplemente le brindo ritmo al mundo perro
Tengo el infierno genital, y su cuerpo suda
Su transpiración es digital, es como una pluma
Su culo brilla mas y mas me atrae con su dulzura

Hoy en mi cuna dormida, quiero su uva
Imagino su sabor es chocolate
Y que le gustaría que descubra la espuma de su valle

Nos iremos lejos donde nadie vea el movimiento
Que el cielo sea el único testigo de este encuentro

Hay que empezar a mover, se nos acaba la era
La luna pronto se ira, el sol vendrá con sus velas
Terremoto que en sus ojos siento
Se traslada a su cuerpo cuando está en movimiento
Estoy volando por su jungla dorada
Grita mi alma! es hora de empezar a mover
A mover el culo

Destinado a bailar ante dios
Como un río que fluye en celo hacia vos
Nuestra vida esta unida por un cordón umbilical de ritmo
Alterando el sentido de solo estar vivo

El hechizo corriendo por tus venas
Sientes la esencia la ciencia de tus piernas
Lámela hasta que grite dámela
Y empieza a entender de que se trata la vida

Su pollera explota en busca de mi sexo
Yo flotando en ella en mi mejor momento
Me muestra su volcán, su lava, su saliva
Me abre su puerta de entrada, no de salida

El mundo lo empieza a mover
El cielo se empieza a caer a tus pies
Nuevamente es tiempo de empezar a brillar
Otra vez grita mi alma!
Es hora de empezar a mover, girl you´re my love bouncing queen
Fuck the world, I can dream your eyes, all the way to coolo in paradise

Amigo lento y veloz 
Sucede que despierto y lejos 
Y acompaño el manjar junto al arroz 
La cena se incendia día a día 
Sólo alimenta las desnutridas almas sin vida 
Librarás a las manos que quieran llegar 
Al lugar donde el agua se pueda besar 
Oirás, las palabras se fueron de allí 
Soñarás con un día poder despertar 
Caminar, encontrarte con la humanidad 
Llorarás, por lo que has visto y lo que verás 
Más allá, escuchaste a un niño callar 
Es su voz el recuerdo de lo que pasó

Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas,"Y así es como dejas caer
Tú lagrima al pasar
Dibujando un camino por tú piel
Yo lo camine y nunca te encontré
Solo descubrí tú fiebre en el placer

Es la envidia que provoca saber que tú boca
Lleva algunos besos de más
Que la culpa es una espina que te vuelve loca
Se que no pudiste frenar
Ese instante que perdida te sentías sola
Donde yo no te podía alcanzar
Me dejaste como un rayo golpeando las olas
Mentías y jurabas

Amor

Y entre risas me pedías que nos embriaguemos
Que inundemos todo, que después nademos
Rompamos cosas lindas suaves como cielos
Juntemos los pedazos para armar infiernos
Amor, se que es solo una palabra
Vos me la regalaste porque ya no la usabas
Mientras nos arrastraba la corriente del nilo
Cosías mis heridas con aguja e hilo

Es la envidia que provoca saber que tú boca
Lleva algunos besos de más
Que la culpa es una espina que te vuelve loca
Se que no pudiste frenar
Ese instante que perdida te sentías sola
Donde yo no te podía alcanzar
Me dejaste como un rayo golpeando las olas
Mentías y jurabas

Dime si piensas en mi cuando te besas con el
Dime si piensas en mi cuando te acuestas con el
Solo dime la verdad, dime la verdad

No escucho lo que dices pero tus labios leo

Que el mundo no se acaba así nomás

Hoy es el momento para cambiar 
Lo que en la vida te hace tan mal 
Dímelo como vas a frenar 
No te detengas por lo que amas 
Aunque parezca que todo anda mal 
No bajes los brazos jamás… chances

Sientes la esencia, la ciencia de tus piernas
Lámela hasta que grite ""dámela"", y empieza a entender de qué se trata la vida

Me muestra su volcan, su lava, su saliva
Me abre su puerta de entrada, no de salida

And a wild attack

And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars

You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercury's and Subaru's
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars

You go out at night and eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek

Is through with cars, he's eatin' bars

Take a tour, through the sewer
Don't strain your brain, paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain
I said don't stop, to punk rock

Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars when the TV's on
And now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race

Breakin' up is hard to do.

Remember when you held me tight,
And you kissed me all through the night.
Think of all that we been through,
And breakin' up is hard to do.

They say that breakin' up is hard to do,
Now I know, I know that it's true.
Don't say that this is the end.
Instead of breakin' up I wish that 
We were makin' up again.

I beg of you don't say goodbye,
Can't we give our love just one more try?

Ilona Knopfler,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Les Moulins de Mon Coeur,2005

My view much wider
New beginning
First breath of air
I'm so aware of
New beginning
I'm thankful for the chance to start again
I've turned the page, a change came with the wind
It's not the end, it's a new beginning

After the rain washed my soul
And turned a bitterness to innocence I knew
The path was open to move on
Allow me to offer you my hand
Let me introduce myself again
The girl I used to be is gone, so long

My world is brighter
My view much wider
New beginning
First breath of air

I left that other world behind me

But on this mountain top is where you'll find me

Ilse DeLange,"If we could look down from above
Would we see constellations off
You and me revolving ?round
Our own lives

Are we like stars, set in our way
Only to fall and burn one day
Do we shine, not knowing
Our own light

What is forever
When every sky shows
As soon as one light ?s out
Another one glows
All of us wonder where do we go
Is it dark, is it light, nobody really knows

When we wish upon a star
For our souls to meet again not far
Does it come true or is it just
A nursery rhyme
And when my time on earth is done
Is a shooting star what I become
Was an impression made, or do I just fade
From your mind

What is forever
When every sky shows
As soon as one light ?s out
Another one glows
All of us wonder where do we go
Is it dark, is it light, nobody really knows

In an old lawn chair 
And I watched the sun set off 
For business west somewhere 
While the sky turned watercolor fine 
And gold and blue 
And the stars all showed up one by one 
And we waited for the moon 

And I thought bout you and I wondered why 
It took so long to say goodbye 
You shined so bright you blinded me 
And left me so I couldnt see

I was the moon chasing the sun 
There was never a prayer of ever catching up 
No matter how fast I would run 
Like the moon chasing the sun 
Just like the moon chasing the sun

And the moon peeked out to the eastern sky 
They both start up about this time each night 
And an evening breeze stopped by 
And brought some sweet relief 
In the silver light I finally let go of the heat 

And I thought bout you and I wondered why 
It took so long to say goodbye 
You shined so bright you blinded me 
And left me so I couldn't see

I can't stop this rain that's got to pour

I'm crying old tears
The dam is breaking after all these years
And you know what, I don't care
I don't care who sees me cry
I've been so strong
But there's no way that I can move on
No, this pain will never disappear

Until I cry these old tears
Just the littlest thing
The sound of your name
I start to feel this ache inside my soul
I try to lock it all in, push it all down

Watching our hearts hang in mid-air
No strings and no fear
Keeps our love suspended up here
We know we could go lose our balance and fall
but a heart that don't dance
Ain't a real heart at all

[Chorus]",Tap Dancing on the Highwire,1998
Ilse DeLange,"Share these lyrics on Facebook!
Yesterday we kept a safer distance
We walked a borderline that seemed so clear
We crossed that line last night
It vanished with the morning light
Now I wanna know, where do we go from here
What does your heart say now
Now that we've touched, now that we've kissed
What does your heart say now
Now that it's come to this

Is it the same, or has something changed
Now that we've let our guards down
I just wanna know, what does your heart say now
Last night we said things one soul to another
In ways that spoken words could not express
No room was left for doubt
But I don't know where I stand now
Don't leave me in the dark
Don't make me guess",What Does Your Heart Say Now,1998
Ilse DeLange,"The silence that's fallen between us
Is the loneliest sound that I've heard
How can we find forgiveness
If we can't find the words

When we don't talk
When we don't speak
When we don't share all the feelings
That are buried so deep
How can we know
What's hidden behind these walls
When the doors locked
When we lose touch
When you and I lose sight of us
The honesty's lost
And the tears say it all
When we don't talk

When so much goes unspoken
And sorry is left unsaid
The silence remains unbroken
And our hearts are breaking instead

When we don't talk
When we don't speak
When we don't share all the feelings
That are buried so deep
How can we know
What's hidden behind these walls
When the doors locked
When we lose touch
When you and I lose sight of us
The honesty's lost
And the tears say it all
When we don't talk

The honesty's lost
And the tears say it all
When we don't talk",When We Don't Talk,1998
Ilse DeLange,"Day one God smiled, 
Gave us all the wisdom of a newborn child 
But by the time we take our first step 
We've already begun to forget 
What the heart knows the heart sees 
We're just as much the forest, as we are the trees 
Every little seed trying to find 
Where the light comes from 

[Chorus]
And it's a world of hurt, nothing works 
It's a lonely little planet made of dust and dirt 
Who'd ever think that in the midst of all this 
Something as beautiful as love exists 
And when I hold you, and you hold me 
Heaven doesn't seem like such a mystery 
Darling in a world of hurt 
You make me feel so good 

Day one of our love, 
Two heartbroken people scared to trust too much 
Oh but here it comes that feelin' again 
That every lover swears will never end 
We thought we'd been there, done that, 
But when we kissed 
We knew we'd never been here,
We've never done this 
All the walls come tumblin' down 
When you love someone 

[Chorus]",World Of Hurt,1998
Ilse DeLange,"I'd lived my life convinced I'd find
Your love somehow, some way
I held on to the faith that you
would show yourself one day
Something in me believed
This night was meant to be

[Chorus: ]
You are the promise I made to my heart
You are the vision I saw in the dark
You are the reason I waited so patiently
So many nights when I closed my eyes
It's you that I have seen
I am the dreamer
You are the dream

It wasn't always clear to see
Were I was headed to
But of all life's roads somehow I chose
The one that led to you

I found my journey's end

In the morning when I wake
I am taken without warning
By the light in your face

As if you came much closer
My heart would surely break

It never ceases me to amaze me
When it`s said and done
After all this time when I am with you
I am always overcome

Used to feel like I was drifting

From my heart

Are held together like stained glass

Ilse DeLange,"What we have here is a misunderstanding
A lack of communication, what we have here is
Two people talking and nobody listening
Screaming and yelling things hard to take back

There's worse things than dying
When you've lost your reason for living
There's no point in fighting
When reasons for staying are missing

I'm leaving
There's something out there that I'm needing
There's more to life, there's got to be more to life
Than breathin'

There are still echoes of you and me laughing
Bouncing off walls of canyons in my mind
Stirring up memories of love long forgotten
How'd we let go of something like that

When I got my first taste of you
You were just what I was lookin' for
And once I had a little I had to have more

'Cause I'd wake up moanin' in the middle of the night
The sound of your name was all that sounded right
Ran back to your door all soaked with sweat
Had to have your kiss before I starved to death

When you're livin' on love and it's all you need
A constant hunger that you've got to feed

How I seem to survive on the touch of your hand
I don't need to eat, I don't need no rest

Makes me feel better, makes me feel strong

Who can swim the deepest ocean?
Who can trust the sky won't fall?
Who can trust they know it all?

All the moments by myself
When I know that you're not here
And I gather all my fears

And they're locked inside believe
But they're not inside of me
And it's fallen from a trust
And it all resolves to dust

Is it possible to see
With every moment over?
What the reason was for me
Was it love? Was it love?

Is it you who makes the sun rise?
Is it you who makes my eyes dry?
Was it you who gave it all?
Can I trust the sky won't fall?

I have loved and I have hated
I have jumped too soon then awaited
And every time I'm fallen down
And every time I almost drowned

And they're locked inside believe

And it's fallen from a trust
And it all resolves to dust

Or run out of control
Or feel I've lost my soul
Or I can't take no more

And when all I know is lost
I'm broken and alone
When I am just a ghost
Who's looking for her home
Like faith without faith

But they're not inside of me

Can we fight the doubts we keep alive?
Can we overcome all fear?

Is it ever really over?

It's been beaten up and used and more
It's been kicked a hundred thousand times

If you read the lines between the paint
Look beyond the cracks that store away
It's hidden in the windows of the walls
Right behind the eyes that saw it all

Given all the facts of circumstance
I did not believe that a romance
Would show itself in all this dark and blue
That's the only place I ever knew

You put me outside my safety-zone
Outside all the lines that made my home
To find out that no one really lives
Without giving what it is you give

A mirror-ball showing me all these faces
A miracle looking in my life, after all
A miracle looking in my life

Everything I felt I kept it in
It carried all the words without a sound
It got me, it almost got too loud

But now that my arms are holding on
To someone as sacred as a song
To the one who wants to be my own
I have found that blood can come from stones

A line around gravity
Spiritual individual
Corrosion and humanity
The mathematics of love and the science of sanity

Living it up in the atmosphere
Nobody dies if the heart is here

Kiss me goodbye
For the doctors are comin'
We all know why
Because I wasn't born

Here we go again
As time passes by here
We don't live and lie here
We're all going to die in the end

Standin' on the corner
Holes in my shirt
Girls drivin' by
Oh come here, don't flirt

'Cause she's never had a girlfriend
And I don't want one either
And I don't want the people
Knowin' that I was smoking ether

In my spare time
I've been thinking about the reason

And people see stars sometimes
And some people raise cadavers

Lights out from the underworld

I say they're maybe spreading some love
Spreading it around and it feels good

But it's hard to be alive

I'm talkin? ?bout romance, slow dance, can't get enough

I've climbed all the highest mountains
I've done every drug in reach
I've made love to pretty women
While the sun set on the beach

But no good time goes unmourned
No good heart goes untorn
Good or bad, it?s all sad
And my acceptance is born

Fog in the air,
Just to make my mind seem clear
Where do I go from here?
I see my breath pushing steam through the air,
Shaking hands run through my hair,
My fears, where do I go from here?

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other,
We’ve been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other,
We’ve been missing each other.

Walking down to the waters edge,
Asking why I’m here instead of home,
Now I stand alone.
I stop to stare at the ocean side
I'm breathing in just to feel it’s side
With his
Like you were here with me.

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other,
We’ve been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other,
We’ve been missing each other.

Oh it's on the wall, it's loud,
It's in the brightest light,
It's when the world is moving.
Oh it's in the faintest cry,
It's in the lovers' eye,
It's when I need you most,
And don't you know,

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other,
We’ve been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?

Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal
Naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nothing but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne

Ain't got no other way so we started and finished it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is

Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end of my mind
But holding to the thought of another time
But looking to the ways at the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely

I understand it always makes you feel a certain way
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me up, send me down, send me never demigod
I remember walkin’ in the heat of the summer
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and I’ve nothing to show
Falling from the doves to the dark of the crow

And gold diggers dig until they find oil
And I'm sittin' here reading what was written 'bout what I do, what I didn't
I ruined relationships before my image but
All I ever wanted was everybody's attention
'Cause most people are nobody 'til somebody kill 'em
Probably thought that my career, be short and sweet
Wishin' I was in your shoes, I'd take them off and find a beach

Simultaneous, miscellaneous, party long and hard
And pray death is quick and painless
Livin' in the spotlight, twistin' life up when it's blinking
I'm never alone
I got my demons and my angels
Can't talk to myself 'cause mama said don't talk to strangers
Relatives, ain't seen 'em since the grass been greener
And some people say I changed but they can't hear me jingle
I want Tina and Nancy, I get Nancy and Tina
Never question myself unless I ask, ""Am I dreamin'?""
The fan mail and subpoenas, jail cells to arenas
Car wash to the cleaners, Walmart to Neiman's
They told me time would tell
I told time to kiss my ass and I heard, ""Can you look this way?
Can you look this way?""

Who the fuck am I? 

A born killer with no conscience 

Leaving niggas with holes in their heads unconscience 

No second chances 

'cause in this game no one advances 

You made your move and fucked up now the devil dances 

No scrilla for this just murderers with blocks 

To run up on their dick and hit em and get em hot 

With a 357 slug pointed at your nose 

Left a bloody mess and a note stuck between your toes 

You fuck with me nigga you're fucking with the warrior 

Anybody destroying you're packing the sig sauer 

Putting niggas off in body bags 'cause in this game you take no prisoners 

Leave it in blood Hare Krishna 

Nobody's breathing niggas stuck on getting even 

You die this evening insanity gon be my reason 

I trail niggas fill niggas and kill niggas 

I introduce the ways that are wicked to real niggas

Who ever epitomise 

And idolise my murderous skills 

With this vivid imagination and slugs that kill 

Off in the zone unorthodox with the world on blocks 

It's unexplainable how I got these bitch niggas locked 

Keep my eyes on my safe and keep this murderous flavour 

Since I picked up a strap I've had this murderous behaviour 

Spread the whole clip around and get the fuck outta Dodge 

I got a ride full of straps in my homies backyard 

It's too cold to proceed without a block to start 

Watch a gat blows him apart as the bullets depart 

Now who the fuck am I? Is the question you ask 

Can't be touched or fucked with is all you need to know 

It's 1998 plus you bitches got to go 

And y'all cain't fuck with me and tell em why 

My adrenaline rush on jump 

Plus you got my arm beneath grabbing with the double barrel pump

Just say you hate me cock the bullshit don't you grip on my dick 

It's Belo Zero mother fuckers same sick ass nut 

Drink a brew and smoke some weed and blow your bitch ass up 

I put in work so recognise I carry my shit on my chest 

More respect and I neglect to come up back with the vest 

I never seen a thousand soldiers hit the dirt on your roll 

Fuck your chief and all the soldiers I'm a king on my own 

I'm coming with force down with Big Chief nigga Rapalot style 

Grip sixteens and triple beams will leave that ass on the pile 

Walk on down and see the light 'cause I'm not faking the shit 

I told you once that I'm a soldier I'm just taking your shit 

Now who am I a born killer nigga fuck what you heard 

I'm too delirious and serious I ain't like a nerd 

Fuck around and call the coroner dig your whole ass up

Now what the purpose when they still gon get struck 

And leave they brains fucked up 

I don't know why they put they eyes on me 

'cause I'm a black material killer trying to keep it low key 

Now what it was they probably didn't know it was me 

But that goes to show em that fancy bitches focus just be 

They want to look up on my Rolex while I spot on my heat 

They see my Lexus car shining when I been on the streets 

With no ticket on it but still they try to find out what's in it 

It's a black nigga with a black chrome on the seat 

In the dark zone it's on

You went away

I tell myself that I'm not missing you 
(I'm not missing you)

Even though I tell it to 
I think about it all the time 
Can't see to get you off my mind 
And it jus won't seem to matter what I do 
Can't stop missing you (missing you) 
I'm missing you 

Never thought each breath was gonna hurt soo much 
The heavy on my heart jus won't subside 
The time we spent together was jus not enough 
So I guess that's why I jus can't say goodbye..noo 

Ohh 
I can't believe that it's over 
That the ties have all been freed 
Still I'd give the world jus to have one more day 
(One more day) 
Jus a chance for me top hold you close and say 
Please don't go away

I tell myself that I'm not missing you 
(I'm not missing you) 
But my heart it jus won't listen (wont listen) 
Even though I tell it to 
I think about it all the time (bout it all the time) 
Can't see to get you off my mind 
And it jus won't seem to matter what I do 
Can't stop missing you 

Time will heel my wings and let me fly 
(Far away) 
Far above the rive that I cry,ohhh 
High above the borrow that has kept me from the truth 
Somewhere out there you've been missing me ike I've seen missing you

While we unveil the ropes
Still a little room left to hang your clothes

When we reach the core
Then we stomp some more

And then we circle back and we stomp some more

You glide across the space, and diagonal past

You move your hips and your arms like a cat
Spin three times, and you're back where you're at
Does anybody catch what this is about?
No? Well, work it out

Slide like a lizard, bark with the crowd
Eyes dilated, dark to the grass
Then when you find you're in bits, blow your nuts to a puzzle
Keep it flowing like the rivers do
You gotta pay attention to the motion of the fish
Stay within the school or you're surely gonna miss
And if you lose your way, it's a cold black abyss
Don't take the chance, not worth the risk

Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright

Who knows?
There's always stains on what's real and true?
Tonight is a special, special occasion
And all that's left for us to do, is move

Ooh, I, I
Where am I going?
What am I doing?
I, I'm alive
Alive
I cannot fly
I'm, I'm so alive
I'm so, I'm so high

(Everybody)
Everybody says I'm nice when I drink
I feel better when I don't need that
Everybody got the fool's defence
(But that's just no thing)
Everybody says that I'm off
It ain't that I'm partyin', I'm drinkin' it up
Can I tell you what the chance of that tonight

I'm not here to make a war
I get crazy sometimes
I'm out of my mind
I'm out of my mind
Nothing can bring me down
Or keep me sound
I won't get home on time

There's no need for you to follow me
I don't need a chaperone you see
Sanity has gone down the drain
I won't apologize to you
I don't know what I want it's true
Believe I'll still be fine

Feel the rain and loose your hair
Swing your hips from the right to the left
You're free to own yourself
But I get crazy sometimes

Nothing can bring me down
Or keep me sound

And ordered up a bottle of wine

So don't stay by my side as I have to deny
The gypsy in me",Gypsy in Me,2014
Imelda May,"There's a place by the woods, up on the hill
Looking over at the liffey
It's hidden away, a secret den just outside Dublin City
A house of sin and debauchery
For many a year gone by
Women, drinkin', gamblin' or anything you might try
Oh welcome to the Hellfire Club, the Hellfire Club

The story goes that on one night
A game of cards was played
A knock on the door and entered in
A man of wealth in spades
He stayed and played one hell of a game
But when one card fell loose
Upon bending down a player saw
The stranger's feet were hooves
Oh welcome to the Hellfire Club, the Hellfire Club

The devil's at the head of the table
Don't run 'cos you wont be able
If you enter, you'll never leave
Your soul, you'll never retrieve

Another one goes that a farmer boy went to sneak a peak
Curiosity got a hold of him, his self control was weak
He was found and suddenly dragged inside and when he reappeared
His hair was white with the fright, he was deaf and dumb with fear
Oh welcome to the Hellfire Club, the Hellfire Club
I said, yeah welcome to the Hellfire Club, the Hellfire Club
Fais ce que tu voudras, they said, do what you want
Fais ce que tu voudras, at the Hellfire Club",Hellfire Club,2014
Imelda May,"It's a passion killer, when you talk and talk about love
A stocking filler, when you want to get the goods
Your lips are moving 
But nothing goes in my ears
You've only proven, your words can bore me to tears

Don't wanna be deep, I wanna dance
Don't wanna be deep, I wanna dance
We'll talk later, later baby
Don't wanna go sleep, I wanna dance
Don't wanna go sleep, I wanna dance
We'll sleep later, later baby

I'm getting weary, of hearing all your fears
Nothing's more scary than wasting all of our years
The music's playing, the band is ready to bop
The singer's saying, let's get ready to rock

Don't wanna be deep, I wanna dance
Don't wanna be deep, I wanna dance
We'll talk later, later baby
Don't wanna go sleep, I wanna dance
Don't wanna go sleep, I wanna dance
We'll sleep later, later baby
I wanna dance, I wanna dance

By analysing the in's and out's of our mind
It's unsurprising the fun has almost died

Don't wanna be deep, I wanna dance
Don't wanna be deep, I wanna dance
We'll talk later, later baby
Don't wanna go sleep, I wanna dance
Don't wanna go sleep, I wanna dance
We'll sleep later, later baby
I wanna dance, I wanna dance

Don't wanna be deep, I wanna dance
Don't wanna be deep, I wanna dance
We'll talk later, later baby",I Wanna Dance,2014
Imelda May,"My thoughts are dark and empty, I'm now crying out loud
Don't know what am I asking for or if an answer can be found
The loneliness is killing, though there's someone in my bed
There's only so much living and I fear I could be dead
But then standing at my window when the night seems like it's won
And everything seems brighter with the sighting of the sun
And I said, oh my God, it's good to be alive
Oh my God, it's good to be alive
I know one thing for sure that I'll die
But today, yeah, it's good to be alive

Lying in my bedroom, my eyes are wide awake
My body's tired and giving up, oh for heaven's sake
Won't you please send me a little sleep, to ease my worried mind
I'm losing rationality, that I won't know how to find
But then standing at my window when the night seems like it's won
And everything seems brighter with the sighting of the sun
And I said, oh my God, it's good to be alive
Oh my God, it's good to be alive
I know one thing for sure that I'll die
But today, yeah, it's good to be alive

Things are looking up for me, when the clock keeps ticking on
Holding on to time gone by, clinging to a song
To pull me through with every word, and rock me with a tune
To hold my hand when the shadow man is hiding in my room
But then standing at my window when the night seems like it's won
And everything seems brighter with the sighting of the sun
And I said, oh my God, it's good to be alive
Oh my God, it's good to be alive
I know one thing for sure that I'll die
But today, yeah, it's good to be alive
Oh my God, it's good to be alive
Oh my God, it's good to be alive
I know one thing for sure that I'll die
But today, yeah, it's good to be alive
Do do do it's good to be alive
Do do do it's good to be alive",It's Good to Be Alive,2014
Imelda May,"Is she enchanted with the spell
That babies know and use so well
The inner star, a light, a glow
That draws you in and makes you know
That she never fails, yet never tries
To put the smile in your eyes

Her tiny hands, her little wrists
she'll clench your finger with her fist
Then grab your heart and steal that too
For that's what little pixies do
She never fails, yet never tries
To put the smile in your eyes

Her tiny hands, her little wrists
she'll clench your finger with her fist
Then grab your heart and steal that too
For that's what little pixies do
She never fails, yet never tries
To put the smile in your eyes

Yeah, she never tries, yet never fails
To Sit on the rainbow's tail",Little Pixie,2014
