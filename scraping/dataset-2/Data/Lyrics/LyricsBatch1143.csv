The Four Tops,"It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
Cause that was the day that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
Mama just hung her head and said, ""Son""

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
""Papa was a rollin' stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when his died,
All he left us was alone""

Hey, Mama, is it true what they say
That Papa never worked a day in his life?
And Mama, there's been talk all around town
Sayin' that Papa had three outside children and another wife
And that ain't right!
Heard some talk about Papa doin' some storefront preachin'
Talked about savin' souls and all the time leachin'
Dealin' in drugs and stealin' in the name of the Lord
Mama just hung her head and said, ""Son""

[Chorus]

Hey, Mama, I heard Papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg, borrow or steal to pay his bills
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin'
Spent most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
Mama looked up with a tear and said, ""Son""

[Chorus]",Papa Was a Rollin' Stone,2007
The Four Tops,"It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time for sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again

And I've got such a long way to go
(Such a long way to go)
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

I was born the son
Of a lawless man
Always spoke my mind
With a gun in my hand
Lived nine lives
Gunned down ten
Gonna ride like the wind

And I've got such a long way to go
(Such a long way to go)
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

Gonna ride like the wind

Accused and tried
And told to hang
I was nowhere in sight
When the church bells rang
Never was the kind to do
As I was told
Gonna ride like the wind
Before I get old

It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time for sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again

The Four Tops,"I remember yet before we met
When every night & day I had to live the life of a lonely one
I remember meeting you
Discovering love could be so true
Shared by 2 instead of only one
When you said you loved me (when you said you loved me)
& we could not be parted (we could not be parted)
I said I built my world around you (built my world around you)
I'm so thankful that I found you (so thankful that I found you)

'Cause lovin' you has made my life sweeter than ever
I've never felt like this before
Lovin' you has made my life so much sweeter than ever

For the love within my heart grows stronger
From day to day
As best I can, I'll always try
To reassure & satisfy
'Cause I'd be lost if you went away

I need you my darling
(Got to have your love right now)
Like a lost soul needs a friend

So come and fill my empty arms and
Fill my empty life

(Baby I need your good lovin')
Nobody knows the emptiness I feel
(Got to have your love right now)
And I feel it
(Baby I need your good lovin')
Nobody knows the loneliness I feel
(Got to have your love right now)
And I feel it because

Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love my dear I'm like a fatherless child
So come and fill my empty arms and
Make my life worthwhile

Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love my dear I'm like a fatherless child

And never let you catch me looking at the sun 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
You'll still be the one 

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it 
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it

The Foursome,"In the region where the roses always bloom,
Breathing out upon the air their sweet perfume,
Lives a dusky maid I long to call my own,
For, I know my love for her will never die,
When the sun am sinking in dat Golden West,
Little robin red breast gone to seek their nests,
And I sneak down to dat place I love the best,
Ever'y evening there along I sigh.

Ida! Sweet as apple cider,
Sweeter than all I know,
Come out! In the silv'ry moonlight,
Of love we'll whisper, so soft and low!
Seems as tho' can't live without you,
Listen, please, honey do!

I guess I'll have to change my plan, 
I should have realized there'd be another man, 
I overlooked that point completely, 
Until the big affair began, 

Before I knew where I was at, 
I found myself upon the shelf, and that was that, 
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there, 
All that I could get was the air, 

My feet are back upon the ground, 
I've lost the one girl (man) I found,

And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

The Frank & Joe Show,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way

There's a man with a gun over there

Everybody look what's going down 

There's battle lines being drawn 
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong 
Young people speaking their minds 
Getting so much resistance from behind 

It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

What a field-day for the heat 
A thousand people in the street 
Singing songs and carrying signs 
Mostly say, hooray for our side 

It's s time we stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

Paranoia strikes deep 
Into your life it will creep 
It starts when you're always afraid 
You step out of line, the man come and take you away

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain

With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

And in this heart of yours burned a flame
A flame that flickered one day and died away
Then, with disillusion deep in your eyes

The years have changed you, somehow
I see you now

Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant

I tell you I mean it

That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

I'd surely be Spring,

If I were a bell

Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

He's just a young boy, he's just sowing his wild oats and that's arightâ??
But momma said ""No, something real strange 'bout my Billy
Farmer down the road said he lost a few of his sheep last night
I know he's my own flesh and blood but he makes my blood run chilly
'Cause I saw from my window and he was on the hill just screaming at the moonâ??

Is it any wonder
We hate to see the sun go down
And is it any wonder
We hate to see the full moon coming 'round

Hand me down my gun son and bring along that silver dinner bellâ??

'Cause I just bear to think about my baby in hellâ??
He went down to the blacksmith got him out of bed and said
""Get your fire hot
Oh shut up your shutters close down your doors, we're gonna need all the heat you got
'Cause I want you to melt my silver bell down to a single shot
I got a job to do and I got to get it done before the sun comes upâ??

So is it any wonder
That we hate to see the sun go down

Then we heard a shot and I said ""Papa got himâ??

And she made me talk dirty in a pink hotel
Doesn't mean she's got eyes for me
She might just want my bones, you see
Hey, Flathead, don't you get mean
She's the second best killer that I have ever seen
They don't come much more sick than you
I could go on if you want me to
It's just so wrong, so very nice
I told you once, and you killed me twice
I saw you one time at the back of the club
Chewing on glass and a ticket stub
I heard they kicked the boy till he bled
Then stood and said, 'oh my god' till she said
'Bara bap bara ra ra bara bap bara ra ra ra.'
Everybody knows you're the one to call
When the girls get ugly at the back of the wall
Josephine says you got a bleeding nose
So taking it with her wherever she goes
Hey, Flathead, don't check me in
Well, hers is a tonic and mine is a gin
They don't come much more slick than you

Let me tell you so
This could be the one thing
That you really need to know
You gotta stop once in a while
Shake off that face of yours

Cause nothing comes easy
Oh it just comes free
You could sing it better
If you sing for me, oh sister

Well I cannot claim
This advice is my own
I landed in the gutter
One night, crawling home
She said don't you look ridiculous
I checked her out meticulously

And I would've stopped to argue
But my teeth were broke
I said I'd love to contradict you
But my life's a joke, oh sister

And she said I'm no genius and I've lost myself
The books are on the table, and the secret's on the shelf
And it's a one time, keep it slow
Wind 'em up and here we go
Get a ride today
And you would still be here tomorrow

Some said she was saintly
Some she was a swinger
Me, I only knew her as the acid jazz singer, come on

Well I'm a lucky man
But maybe so is she
And maybe this is just the way it has to be
It's all based on speculation
It's a crazy my occupation to me
And though I didn't much believe her
I was bound to call
I really didn't wanna miss a single thing at all
Oh sister

And she said I'm no genius and I've lost myself
The books are on the table, and the secret's on the shelf

Are asking when your love is gonna show
And who knows why the love you need
Will always pass you by
Well I heard it's true your love is gonna grow

So let me know, 'cause I can stay, or honey I can go
Just to wherever you tell me so
And find my place there and there I'll stay

And said come on she's not burned, she's just gone

And when morning comes
The sun is gonna shine

Don't forget your minor key's
Your half lit cigarette
'Cause when morning comes
God knows that you'll be mine

So let me in
I'm ready to beg and to sing for my sins
Not leave it to chance and sweet coincidence
Well, that's just crazy and you know it's true

Well, they said you was long gone
I just laughed and said alright bring her home tonight
And I heard you was graciously put on
I just laughed and said good night, guess it's alright

Baby doll
The men who hang like flowers in you're hall
Are asking when
Your love is gonna show

And who knows why
The love you need will always pass you by
Well, I heard it's true
Your love is gonna grow

So let me know
'Cause I can stay or honey I can go
Just to wherever you tell me so
And find my place there and there I'll stay

Well, they said you was burned out
I just laughed and said come on, she's not burned she's just gone
And it took me too long till I found out
Faces that you know the best oh well, I guess

And they laughed when you said you was leaving
Everybody knows you well except for me, can't you tell?
And you watched from the wings of the late show
Roses by your feet are red for me you said

The princesses of heaven and hell
Who thought they knew me well
There goes my wishbone
It calms my crooked friend
Screaming he knew I was dead

You could tell I was a wicked man
Well there was no one on the wall
But the stupid and the small
But they always do the best they can

I was never too easy to please
Always on my knees

I was shaking, I was steady
I was pleading to be left alive

Her old man streamed up in a hole
Another uneven soul
There goes my last wish
Here comes my audience
Pitchforks pointing my way
And it's no coincidence

I was in a bind of the body and the mind
And my mother was the last to know
When I told her I was runnin'
I was better off a'gone
And she never even said no, no, no, no, no

I was never thick but the fall wouldn't click
So I never had the best excuse
You couldn't say that I was best
So they put me to the test
With a never ending soul abuse

So I walk you to your car And we can talk it out in the rain

And we are leaving some things unsaid
And we are breathing deeper instead
And we are leaving some things unsaid

I can sing myself to sleep
No more

Not that you're the one
Not to say I'm right
Not to say today
And not to say a thing tonight",Unsaid,2003
The Fray,"The day's last one-way ticket train pulls in
We smile for the casual closure capturing
There goes the downpour
There goes my fare thee well

There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
'Cause I'm already gone

There's so many words that we can say
Spoken upon long-distance melody
This is my hello
This is my goodness

There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
'Cause I'm already gone

Maybe in five or ten
Yours and mine will meet again
Straighten this whole thing out
Maybe then honesty need not be feared as a friend or an enemy
But this is the distance
And this is my game face

There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
Is there really no way to reach me?
Am I already gone?
So this is your maverick
And this is Vienna",Vienna,2003
The Fray,"I do it on a whim, its rhyme without reason whatever comes to mind I'll pull it from thin air. 
I've learned to improvise to fill my time I don't want to 
Live this life, no I don't want to live this life without reason. 
Never want to live without it, never want to live, 
I don't want to live without reason.

Never want to live without it, Never want to, I don't want to live without Reason. 
I do it on a whim, with no motivation following this line and I don't know why, 
But I've learned to capture time it's my redirection I don't want to live 
This life, no I don't want to live this life without reason 
Never want to live without it, never want to live, 
I don't want to live without reason.

Never want to live without it, Never want to, I don't want to live without reason.

The Fray,"There are certain people you just keep coming back to
She is right in front of you
You begin to wonder, could you find a better one
Compared to her, now she's in question

And all at once the crowd begins to sing
Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same

Maybe you want her, maybe you need her
Maybe you started to compare to someone not there

Looking for the right one, you line up the world to find
Where no questions cross your mind
But she won't keep on waiting for you without a doubt
Much longer for you to sort it out

And all at once the crowd begins to sing
Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same

Maybe you want her, maybe you need her
Maybe you started to compare to someone not there
Maybe you want it, maybe you need it
Maybe it's all you're running from
Perfection will not come

And all at once the crowd begins to sing
Sometimes
We'd never know what's wrong without the pain
Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same

Maybe you want her, maybe you need her
Maybe you've started to compare to someone not there
Maybe you want it, maybe you need it
Maybe it's all you're running from
Perfection will not come

Maybe you want her, maybe you need her
Maybe you had her, maybe you lost her to another
To another",All at Once,2005
The Fray,"If only I knew what I know
I'd make it a point to say so
To everyone that got me here
And everyone that made it

Clear I was dead wrong all along
You said it for my sake
That I would not lose my way
When I was astray

I'm doing the best that I could
Trying my best to be understood
Maybe I'm changing slowly
I'd get out, turn around if only I

Knew I was dead wrong all along
You said it for my sake
As if I would lose my way
When I was dead wrong all along

Mine is not a new story
Mine is not a new story
Min is nothing new
But it is for me

So I was dead wrong all along

That could make you come back down
You made up your mind to leave it all behind

You fall away from your past
But it's following you now
You fall away from your past
But it's following you

You left something undone; it's now your rerun
It's the one you can't erase
You should have made it right, so you wouldn't have to fight
To put a smile back on your face

You fall away from your past
But it's following you

You fall away

The Fray,"Twenty years, it's breaking you down
Now that you understand there's no one around
Take a breath, just take a seat
You're falling apart and tearing at the seams

Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know why
Hold on tight, wait for tomorrow, you'll be alright

It's on your face; is it on your mind?
Would you care to build a house of your own?
How much longer, how long can you wait?
It's like you wanted to go and give yourself away

Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know why
Hold on tight, wait for tomorrow, you'll be alright

It feels good
Is that reason enough for you?

But I'm staring at what once was the wall
Separating east and west
Now they meet amidst the broad daylight

So this is where you are, and this is where I am
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred

It's hard, I must confess
I'm banking on the rest to clear away
'Cause we have spoken everything
Everything short of 'I love you'

You, right where you are, from right where I am
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred

And who's to say it's wrong?
And who's to say that it's not right
Where we should be for now?

So this is where you are, and this is where I am

Opens up for nobody

A part of you that'll never show
You're the only one that'll ever know

Even though we try to stay afloat
I swear its gonna kill me
Even though you think it wont
So why rock a boat and make waves
And everything's coming okay
So why am I confused if you love me
Thought this would be smooth sailing

Cause I don't wanna let you go
And we're caught in the undertow
Cause I ain't losing my control
And we're caught in the undertow
I hold a prayer is all our own
But we need air we go alone
Cause I don't wanna let you go
Til we're caught in the undertow

I don't wanna cry every time we try it never fails
Change the illusion wanna be close set for sail
My hearts in your hand don't you go hurt me again
All we got is one chance and its sink or swim

Why am I confused if you love me

Everybody knows it but no one tries to stop it
Cause she barely even knows him but if she could see inside
Everything is quiet as she waits to tell him who she is

Is this all we get to be absolute
Quiet but I'm sure there is something here
Tell me everything 'cause I want to hear

It's a kiss that sits upon on her lips, that waits for planes and battle ships
She wants to be a dancer and he has got a picture
On his wall and it's a sailor in a new port every night

The Fray,"The daughter's father watches, quietly we assume
He's no longer with us, but he left this dusty room

And your name and it's an honor
It's a shame but it's your honor
To take it on your shoulder
'Till you can find another

That's enough for now
He should have never left you broken
He should have held you
Things your father never could do
That's enough for now
He would have never left you broken
He would have held you
Things your father never told you

The century before you, never could turn twenty-one
Years and years he waited, just watching for a son
Someone to go ahead, to take the name instead
Years and years he waited, and a daughter came instead, but

That's enough for now
He should have never left you broken
He should have held you
Things your father never could do
That's enough for now
He would have never left you broken
He would have held you
Things your father never told you

Breathing comes in pairs
Except for twice
One begins and one's goodbye

Sixty years of sorrow, he got five or six of bliss
Left my mothers' mother
Without so much as a kiss
As a kiss

But that's enough for now
He never wanted to leave you broken
He would have held you
Things your father never told you
That's enough for now
I would have never left you broken
I would have held you

The Fray,"Happiness, is just outside my window
I thought it crashed blowing eighty-miles an hour?
Or is happiness a little more like knocking
On your door, and you just let it in?

Happiness, feels a lot like sorrow
Let it be, you can't make it come or go
But you are gone. not for good but for now
Gone for now, feels a lot like gone for good

Happiness, is a firecracker sitting on my headboard
Happiness was never mine to hold
Careful child, light the fuse and get away
Cause happiness throws a shower of sparks

Happiness, damn near destroys you
Breaks your faith, to pieces on the floor
So you tell yourself, that's enough for now
Happiness has a violent roar

Happiness, is like the old man told me
Look for it, but you'll never find it all
Let it go, live your life and leave it
Then one day, wake up and she'll be home

She'll be, she'll be home
She'll be home
She'll be home

You want to cry but there's nothing coming
They're gonna push until you give in, say when

Another plan sends another century
Around again another nation, fallen

What would I say

The Fray,"I said I told you everything but I left something out
Underneath the stairwell

I can barely say
All I know is now I want to stay
Has it been too long since I went away?
Cause I'm trying to find the words but I can barely say

Waiting silently but they barely noticed me
But I've been talking in my sleep when anybody sees they turn and run from me

Maybe I won’t,

What I never knew I needed,
What I never knew I needed,

She's a lady with beauty and grace
And she's got all this till you see her face
A pair so big they'll really grab your eyes

Big bad Bill was a man of means
When he come around you hear Dixie scream
They jumped in his Cadillac
Everyday for them was fun
Cruisin' on the highway called one o one
They ain't comin' back, no

Dixie, won't you be my wife
Dixie, Dixie Dynamite?

Couldn't believe now what they saw
Dixie driving with her top on down

They sit there and talk about their dairy farm

Bill said, ""Dixie, won't you be my wife?""
She said, ""Yeah, babe let's share our life
You seem to be the man for me""
Dixie got as fat as a horse
Bill dumped her and gave her a divorce
He ran out the back door as fast as he could

He owns a disco club in Hollywood

It's just the things that you do (5x)

The way you do the things you do

(Verse 1)

8:05, the alarm clock sound

I grab my shoe and turn the damn thing down

But now it's 9 o'clock and I still ain't up up yet

Work on time, yeah I admire the concept

You got me yearnin??? and I mean anticipating

Seeing you I can't wait and so not concentrate

My mind is blind of all the time, thinking of you

And the way you do things you do

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)

I walk in the park for a midnight rendevous

For a slow dance, romance, my motive is see through

I wanna be with you

But I ain't hiding

A wave of love and I'm gliding and ridening

Things like that when you hear me

Sayin' sort of sounds like that same old clich??

Climbing the highest mountain and swimming the deepest sea

But I can't front, I want you to be want me

Cause baby when you grab me tightly

You send chills and tend to insight me

When you caress and fumble me lightly

Oh girl watch up cause she might be

Settin' yourself up the way that you tease me

Sooner or later you might have to please me

It's just something about you

The way you do things you do

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)

Now why oh why would an incredibly fly guy like me

Be chasing one lady

It's just something about you

The way you carry yourself when you're out you

Seem to have a sort of captivating style, I've parked the feelin'

But your whip is appealing

Since this is a subject that I brought up

I just mind as well admit that I'm caught up

It ain't the clothes that you're wearin'

Your perfume or the style that that your hair's in

It ain't your body, how slim your waist is

Your new jeans and how pretty your face is

But I feel funny when it close proximity

Make it wonder what's gettin' in to me

It's just something about you

The way you do the things you do

(Chorus)

(Bridge)

It's nothing that you do (2x)

The way you do the things you do

(Verse 4)

The mystery???s of this world I ponder

Just sittin' back let my mind wonder

What the, why the, who the, how the hell is this young lady

Drive me so crazy

Reply in thought pose like the thinker

I play you with kiss or a wink

Or a smile just to show you

It's something about you

The way you do the things you do

Come here, come here

Come on out, don't worry

You want me to chase you don't you?

Just come here, I've got you now

No matter time nor place
They don't understand that us kids
Are going to make some mistakes

""Parents"" 24 lines, 734 characters.

I remember one year
My mom took me school shopping
It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister
All hopped in the car
We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall
MY mom started bugging with the clothes she chose
I didn't say nothing at first
I just turned up my nose
She said, ""What's wrong? This shirt cost $20""
I said, ""Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!""
The next half hour was the same old thing
My mother buying me clothes from 1963
And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!
I said, ""Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep""
She said, ""You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet""
I said, ""Mom, let's put these clothes back, please""
She said ""no, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show""
I said, ""This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer
Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers
But if you don't want to I can live with that but
You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks""
She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same
Inevitably the first day of school came
I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick
But my mom said, ""No, no way, uh-uh, forget it""
There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax
I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought
The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought
And those who weren't laughing still had a ball
Because they were pointing and whispering
As I walked down the hall
I got home and told my Mom how my day went
She said, ""If they were laughing you don't need the,
""Cause they're not good friends""
For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom
That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times
So to you all the kids all across the land
There's no need to argue
Parents just don't understand

OK, here's the situation
""parents"" 68 lines, 2662 characters.
My parents went away on a week's vacation and
They left the keys to the brand new Porsche
Would they mind?
Umm, well, of course not
I'll just take it for a little spin
And maybe show it off to a couple of friends
I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood
Well, maybe I shouldn't
Yeah, of course I should
Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot
I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking
I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking
You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions
I honked my horn just to get her attention
She said, ""Was that for me?""
I said, ""Yeah""
She said, ""Why?""
I said, ""Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy""
She said, ""How do I know you're not sick?
You could be some deranged lunatic""
I said, ""see 'mon toots, my name is the Prince
Beside, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?""
She agreed and we were on our way
She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word
We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive
We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes
She kicked her shoes off onto the floor
She said, ""Drive fast, speed turns me on""
She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas
We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast
The sun roof was open , the music was high
And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh
She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far
I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car
We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche
And to make this long story short - short
When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell
I said, ""I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer""
I almost had a heart attack that day
Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway
I was arrested, the car was impounded
There was no way for me to avoid being grounded
My parents had to come off from vacation to get me
I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me
My parents walked in
I got my grip, I said, ""Ah, Mom, Dad, how was your trip?""
They didn't speak
I said, ""I want to plead my case""
But my father just shoved me in the car by my face
That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived
They took turns -
One would beat me while the other one was driving
I can't believe it, I just made a mistake
Well parents are the same no matter time nor place
So to you all the kids all across the land
Take it form me
Parents just don't understand",Parents Just Don't Understand,1996
The Fresh Prince,"Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy, you all know me I was scared as hell
He comes to me at night when I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside, he wears it anyway!
He's home when I'm awake, but he shows up when I sleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare, on my street!
It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten off of tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and down watch a movie
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I've never seen in my life
That was alright though, ''cause lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
Buggin' , cold havin' a ball
And somethin' 'bout Elm Street was the movie we saw
The way it started was decent
You know, nothin' real fancy
About this homeboy named Fred
And this girl named Nancy
But, word! When it was over, I said, ""Yo, that was def!""
And everything seemed alright when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, on my street!
It was burnin' in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin'
I checked the clock, and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I wanted something cool to quench my thirst
I thought to myself, Yo! This heat is the worst!
But when I got downstairs, I noticed something was wrong
I was home all alone, but the TV was on.
I thought nothin' of it as I grabbed the remote
I pushed the power button, and I then almost choked
When I heard this aweful voice comin' from behind, it said
""You are my favorite rapper, but now you must die!"" (?)
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke inside my drawers and screamed, ""So long ''cause!""
Got halfway up the block, I calmed down and stopped screamin'
And thought, Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin'
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I'm thinkin' since this is a dream, I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the big, bad, Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said,
""Here's what we'll do. We've got a lotta work here, me and you,
The souls of your friends, you and I will claim.
You've got the body, and I've got the brains.""
I said, ""Yo, Fred. I think you've got me all wrong.
I ain't parnters with nobody with nails that long.
Look, I'll be honest man, this team won't work
The girls won't be yours, Fred, your face is all burnt""
Fred got mad and his head started steamin'
But I thought what the hell, I'm only dreamin'
I said, ""Please leave Fred, so I can get some sleep.
But gimme a call, and maybe we'll hang out next week.""
I pat him on the shoulder, say, ""Thanks for stoppin' by.""
Then I opened up the door and said, ""Take care, guy!""
He got mad, threw back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, Hold up...that hurt.
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, ""Freddy, uh, uh, there's been an aweful mistake here.""
No further words, and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head and said,
""Oh please, do somethin' with Fred!""
He jumped on my bed and threw the covers with his claws
Tried to get me...but my alarm went off. and then
Silence
It was a whole new day, I thought.
Heh...I wasn't scared of him, anyway.
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street.
Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff
See'mon, see'mon...
See'mon Jeff, answer!
See'mon man
Jeff: Hello...
Prince: Jeff, it's Prince man, Jeff, wake up Jeff, wake up!
Jeff: What do you want?!
Prince: Jeff, wake up, man. Listen to me. Jeff
Jeff: It's 3 O'clock in the morning, what do you want?
Prince: Jeff, listen, Jeff, would you listen to me? Whatever you do, don't

But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

Just last week when I was walking down the street
I observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet
I walked up to her I said hello
She said you're kind of cute I said yes I know
But by the way sweetheart what's your name
She said my friends like to call me exotic elaine
I said my name is the prince and she said why
I said well I don't know I'm just a hell of a guy
But enough about me yo let's talk about you
And all the wonderful things that you and I can do
I popped some cash and in a little bit of time
I showed some cash and the girl was mine
I took her over town I wined her and dined her
She ask me did I like her I said well kinda
All of a sudden she jumped out her seat
Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street
She started grabbin all over me kissing and hugging
So I shoved her away I said you better stop buggin
She got mad looked me dead in my face
Threw her hands in the air and yelled out rape
I got scared when she started to yell
So I handed her my wallet and ran like hell
I was duckin through alleys right and left
But when the cops caught up they almost beat me to death
I was arrested charged with agrivated assault
(Yo clancy we got him)
But it wasn't my fault
Nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play

I was in a bar one friday night
Cooling watching a mike tyson fight
I was maxin and relaxin sippin on tequilla
When this girl walked up she said hi my name is sheila
I responded by saying hello
She paid for my drink and then said let's go
20 minutes later things were starting to cook
As we pulled up into her house I said I'm with you toots
The music was soft and there was wine in the glasses
She started winking and making little passes
At me she pat me close that's when she got bold
She started feeling up my back I said oh your hands are cold
We went to her bedroom thinking of one thing
Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring
I carresed her body and I kissed her cheek
And that's when I observed those satin bed sheets
I felt that it was time for me to make my move
I thought I better hurry up before I busted a groove
I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue
A door slammed and a voice said baby where are you
Her boyfriend busted in he grinned an evil grin
And said boy I'm a tear your butt limb from limb
I was scared as hell where I was supposed to go
I just yelled geronimo and jumped out the window
Just my luck we were in a snow storm
And all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm
And to top the night off I had to break in my place
Because my keys were on pants back on sheila's book case
I was done sneezing and coughing
I hope this doesn't happen to often
But nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhymes and get the hell away

Prince: I don't know I don't think they really do
Jazzy: I think you should give 'em another example
Prince: awright give me a scratch let's make it funky right here

I got a ring on my phone may 5th last year
It was my girlfriend betty I said hello dear
I was just about to call you I got a couple tickets to the run dmc concert
(I'm wit it)
It's six o'clock now at eight will you be ready
(Yeah)
Aight fine see you then betty
I combed my hair washed and brushed my teeth
Got funky fresh dressed in my la cox ? ? ? ? 
Got to betty's at eight I was ready to jet
Until betty's mon said betty's not ready yet
I sat there for at least an hour
It was ten after nine before she got in the shower
9:35 she comes downstairs
And said I need a little longer to finish my hair
At ten o'clock we had then missed the show
She comes downstairs and says let's go
Go where go to sleep I'm gone
I was steamin like a demon as I drove home
But it just goes to show
Not trying to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme just remember my rhymes
Take heed to my rhymes and get the hell away

They help me calm down and I can get through it

Mic in a strangle hold sweat pourin'
And like Jordan yo I'm scoring

The Fresh Prince,"Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the base and let the alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime

School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
A back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressing less
And checking out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan stting on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out hunting and girls doing likewise
Honking at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beeping at
It's like the summer's a natural afradesiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hit you and get you equipped for the summer time

It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
'Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
'Cause you're invited to a barbeque that's starting at 4
Sitting with your friends cause y'all remincise
About the days growing up and the first person you kiss
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playing out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wiping your car down
It's time to cruise so you head to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't spead through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new defintion' of summer madness

The Fresh Prince,"Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air

In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.

First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm this might be alright.

But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet
I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'

I pulled up to the house about seven or eigth
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air",The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (Theme From NBC's the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air),2017

Riding in my uncle's car, wanting to become a star
Having dreams to be like Mike, hooping in my all black Nikes
Flying kites and shooting dice, sneaking in the movies twice
Staying up and watching Cops, walking outside in Michael socks
Being afraid of chicken pox, check my bowl on Magnavox
Running up and down my block, sweating cause the sun is hot

Police burns in the hood, because somebody just got jacked
Every girl I slam they call, I told em call me back
Haters got backhanded, because they were always talking smack
Instigators chit chat, and were known for spreading rumors
Ballers went from stabs, to buying more of consumers

I use to wear a swatch watch, now I only wear Movado
Went from bare foot on a bus, to holding keys to Monte Carlos
Now it's a big body Expedition, showing my naked ass provado
Went from hood to all good, shh playing a game like huh brah
Backyard nickel and dime that, now boys be moving birds
Use to carry my knife special, now it's gats and smoking sherm
Use to mix at house parties, freestyling to Whodini
Now I'm signing rappers to paid in full, eating shrimp and fetichini
Boy I use to ride big wheels, while wearing them Chuck Taylors
Now it's Jordans, Air Macs, even pink-green gators
Use to be sneaking in Lover's Land, or at the drive-in movies
Now it's Tinsel Town or Motel 6, where this hoe can do me
Use to watch freestyle the man, or Rap City on BET
Now I star in sitcoms, movies and got my own video show on t.v., what

[Redd]
Should of seen it I was right there, when a problem jumped off
Rounds got dumped off, leaving niggas bumped off
Always trying to get the hook up, leaving your girl shook up
Women breaking my pager, phone line you can't look up
We had ice on us, merchandise on us
Busting at other hoods, when they had a price on us
Listening to flow tapes, people saying rewind it
Pulling out my piece, and bystanders get blinded
From winter to summer time, there wasn't no leaving our block
When the laws made it hot, we was freezing our block
Man we got enough money, to make my neck look pretty
Cause we done made enough money, to make my check look pretty
Rapping at talent shows, saying phrase too frequent though
Niggas talk about Fasachi, we roll that in Regal though
Seein niggas Redd capping on, the comedy bout my chaperone
My dress code is casual, but all of a sudden I'm valuable

The Funk Brothers,"Childhood part of my life, it wasn't very pretty.
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was hard times,
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.
Listen!  my father didn't know the meaning of work,
He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find,
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine,
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,
I'm doin' fine, on cloud nine.
Let me tell you about cloud nine.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be
(cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,
And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free
(cloud nine)  and you're a million miles from reality.
I wanna say I love the life I live,
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine.
I'm riding high
On cloud nine, you're as free as a bird in flight
(cloud nine)  there's no diff'rence between day and night

Each time you break away, I fear you've gone to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow, bringing you back again
Hurting me more and more

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside
'Cause each day that passes by you got me
Never knowing if I'm coming or going, but I, I love you
This old heart darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes, I do
These old arms of mine miss having you around
Makes these tears inside start a-falling down

Always with half a kiss
You remind me of what I miss
Though I try to control myself
Like a fool I start grinnin' 'cause my head starts spinnin' 'cause I

I love you
This is old heart, darling is weak for you
I love you, yes I do, yes I do

Ooh, I try hard to hide, my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin'
The way you're treating me, leaves me incomplete
You're here for the day, gone for the week now

But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours whenever you want me

That life holds nothing dear, but you.
The smiles that once you gave to me
I scarcely ever see them now
Though many, many times I see
A dark'ning shadow on your brow.
Refrain:

To that dear home beyond the sea
My Kathleen shall again return.
And when thy old friends welcome thee
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn.
Where laughs the little silver stream
Beside your mother's humble cot
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam
There all your grief will be forgot.
Refrain: ","I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen",1991
The Fureys,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair. 

Scarlet ribbons, there's magic in the air. 
Scarlet, scarlet ribbons for her hair.",Scarlet Ribbons,1991
The Fureys,"When first I saw the love-light in your eyes, 
I dreamed the world held not but joy for me. 
And even though we drifted far apart, 
I never dream but what I dream of thee. 

I love you as I never loved before, 
Since first I met you on the village green. 
Come to me or my dream of love is or, 
I love you as I loved you, when you were sweet, 
When you were sweet sixteen. 

I love you as I never loved before,

The Fureys,"They come from the farms and the factories too 
And they all soon forget who they are 
The cares of today are soon washed away 
As they sit at a stool by the bar 
The girl with green eyes in the Rolling Stones shirt 
Doesn't look like she works on the land 
The man at the end, he's a very good friend 
Of a man who sells cars second hand 

Down at the Red Rose Cafe in the Harbor 
There by the port just outside Amsterdam 
Everyone shares in the songs and the laughter 
Everyone there is so happy to be there 
The salesmen relax with a few pints of beer 
As they try not to speak about trade 
The poet won't write any verses tonight 
He may sing a sweet serenade 
So pull up a chair and forget about life 
It's a good thing to do now and then 
And if you like it here I have an idea 
Tomorrow let's all meet again

I heard a young girl calling 
Michael they have taken you away,
For you stole trevelyn's corn
So the young might see the morn,
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay

Low lie, The Fields Of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly
Our love was on the wing
We had dreams and songs to sing, 
Its so lonely round the Fields of Athenry

By a lonely prison wall
I heard a young man calling
'Nothing matters Mary, when you're free'
Against the famine and the crown, 
I rebelled, they brought me down 
Now its lonely round the Fields of Athenry

By a lonely harbour wall
She watched the last star falling 
As the prison ship sailed out against the sky
Sure she'll live in hope and pray
For her love in Botney Bay 
Its so lonely round the Fields Of Athenry",As I Leave Behind Neidín,2007
The Furious Five,"It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so-so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say ""you want some more?""
Livin' on a see-saw

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, say what?

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them
Huh, smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Till one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young

So don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha

Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much, Raaah!

A castle in the sky, one mile high 
Built to shelter the rich and greedy 
Rows of eyes, disguised as windows 
Looking down on the poor and the needy 
Miles of people, marching up the avenue 
Doin? what they gotta do, just to get by 
I'm living in the land of plenty and many 
But I'm damn sure poor and I don't know why

Too much, too many people, too much 
Too much, too many people, too much!

A man's on a ledge, says he's gonna jump 
People gather round, said, ""He won't he's just a chump"" 
?Cause he lost his job, then he got robbed 
His mortgage is due and his marriage is through 
He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought 
He got nothing to eat, no shoes on his feet 
She even left his clothes out in the street 
He keeps hearing noises when he's at home
He always hears voices when he's all alone 
His wife took the kids, the car and the crib 
In this man's world, so much for Women's Lib

You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law, and I know my way around

Down in the Village, you might think I'm silly 
But you can't tell the women from the men sometimes 
They're sugar and spice and everything nice 
But when you get ?em home ain't no telling what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eating dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat 
I barely can stand, on my own two feet
I got a bad habit and I just can't break it 
Something?s on my mind and I just can't shake it 
I need some time, and I want some space 
I gotta get away from the human race?

Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much! Raaah!

Staring at a skyscraper reaching into heaven 
When over in the ghetto I'm livin' in hell 
Just play ball or be an entertainer 
'Cause niggaz like me can't read too well
Nobody loves me, nobody cares 
I dreamed about a life but I'm livin' in a nightmare 
Paranoid schizo, set back, snowbound 
Bad news psycho, heart attack, breakdown!

I might find the strength to make another day 
If I didn't have to get up and do my thing 
I would probably sleep my whole life away
I messed up a nice dream, somethin' bout ice cream 
Whipped cream, fruits and a cherry on top 
Now I gotta get up and face the world, huh 
The pressure is on, It ain't never gonna stop
I sho' gotta learn to use my mind 
I don't want to be kissing nobody's behind 
Just standin' on line lookin' like a jerk 
Gotta get off my butt and do a full day's work
I ran into a pothole, got into a car crash 
Should?a been thinking and tried to fake whiplash

On 42nd Street, lookin' for some action 
Women standing on the corner selling satisfaction 
One young punk just leaning on the fence 
Tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Really is a prankster, tried to be a gangster 
Real big wheel when a gun is in his hands 
Just did a stick-up, just got picked up

And the tears fall from the doctor's eyes
Because in this room, on this day 
The Good Lord has giveth, and taketh away, huh!
The gift of life really means a lot 
And in the ghetto your life is all you got 
So you take to the streets, trying to exist 
In the trash and slime of a world like this
What you watch on TV tells you what life is supposed to be 
But when you look outside the only thing you see 
Is the poverty stricken reality, Heh!
Abandoned places, angry faces 
Much hate and hunger throughout the races 
You say, ""I'm grown and I'm on my own 
So why don't everybody just leave me alone!""
Now you stay at home, talking on the phone 
Doin' ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone 
They never took the time to tell you ?bout sex 
So you had to learn about it in the discotheques
Nine months later, the baby is there 
And the Nigga that did it said, ""I don't care!"" 
You don't have enough money to help feed two 
So you have to choose between the baby and you
The sky was crying, rain and hail 
When you put your baby in the garbage pail 
Then you kissed the kid and put down the lid 
And you tried to forget what you just did, Huh!
The muffled screams of a dying baby 
Was enough to drive the young mother crazy 
So she ran in the rain trying to ease the pain 
Huh huh, And she drove herself insane

The Furious Five,"[Chorus]
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft.

I was sittin' on the corner just a-wastin' my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme.
I got on the microphone and what do you see?
Huh, the rest was my legacy.

I was born to be the king of the be-bop swing,
To have stallions and medallions, big diamond rings.
I own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
Because rap is the game that I control.

I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap somethin' people wanted to hear.
See, before my reign, it was the same old same,
""To the ba with the ba"", that street-talk game,

So if you ever, let me make this clear,
If you ever think that we're steppin' out of here,
You ever think you're gettin' up, down, around or in,
Huh huh, you better think again, my friend

Because the door is closed and we're in town
And the only place you can go is down!

Step, step, step, step, step off.)

Well, I'm Kieth Cowboy and you're my cow,
So what you MC's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan.
You won't even get bread and butter, my man.

Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back,
And if you want to hang yourself out to dry,
It's the beautiful round-up in the sky.

I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's in cock.
I'll be carryin' out bodies stiff as a rock.
Carryin' out a million dollars in my pockets and hand,
But I carry out orders from no man,

'Cause anything you want to do, I already did.
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid,
But in my MC school, my class is packed
And tricks are for kids so I left your ass back.

The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another.
I buy a mansion for my mother.
The 24/7, the cool-Aid smile,
Say, ""Hey, crack a lemon and look at my pile.""

[Chorus]

Come on.
Now you know just who I am
And what I do because I'm in demand,
Because I look good.

Do you hear, my man?
And if you can't take that, you chump your old hand.
One girl at a time get an MC
So how could you think that you rank with me?

If you only did your homework, you would surely find
When Scorp' get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind

And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash.
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talkin' don't pay, you're driftin' away.
When I see you on the stage, I'm-a blow you away.

You're right.
There is no diff between me and you
Except I look good and you look through.
Take that.

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft.

Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped into the MC scene.
Bitin' your moves, takin' fake awards,
Sayin' everyone else is perpetratin' the frauds,

But you're nothin' but a clone of a flesh and bone.
Now you're tryin' to play gone on the microphone,
But I tell you 'bout a night and you know I'm right
When you listen to us rockin' to the broad daylight,

And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss,
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us.
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you,

But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
'Cause without the source, the force won't survive.
For eternity, the source is alive.

You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpetrator, 
Forever in a world of you and a girl,
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl.

You must spread the words of the master teacher.
You die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat you.
The words are a gift we will never flaunt.
That's why we're gonna get everything we want.

Just like a shadow in the night on a sight unseen
And I'm the bonafide vocal master supreme,
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
For my rhymes make dollars plus they make sense,

See, you're down with Cowboy, you'll be rockin' the show.
With King Lu, Tommy Gun and, huh, Scorpio,
Kamikaze Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And goin' down in the books is the king of the night,

So if you're ever in a battle, I'm-a make you my slave
And I'm-a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave.
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme, then bury yourself, huh.

I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess.
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only MC that'll never die,

So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top,
But when you see Mellie Mel, you're gonna have to drop.

And not only that,

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh-huh.

And for all you MC's, you heard my story
On my super-fly, cold-crushin' fame and glory,
How I rocked the children and the young ladies.
I even rocked the country that was overseas

'Cause I can rock anybody from any crew.
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm-a do it to you.
I'm-a show you how I rocked it, why'all, all night long,
But when I rocked with Chaka Khan, I just said,

""Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said, 
""Let me rock you, that's all I want to do. 
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said.
""Let me me rock you 'cause I feel for you.

Chaka Khan, won't you tell me what you want to do?
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you.
Chaka Khan, let me tell you what I want to do.
I want to love you, want to hug you, want to squeeze you too,

So let me take me in your arms, let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
'Cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka.
I'll make you more than just a physical spell.
I want to rock you, Chaka baby, 'cause my name is Mellie Mel.""

Say what, why'all.
Say what.

The Furys,"Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Wake up in the morning who the fuck am I screwing

'Cause even in the dark, baby I'mma shine bright

Let's take your bitch ass back to o five,
Close your eyes, take a rough nigga look, Atlanta lights
Club vision, PJ in my hand, I'm on the couch
Man this nigga Meech just blew a quarter mil, he bought a house
Man you niggas gonna lace up your sneaks? It's time to ball
Presidential at the Swiss Hotel, makin' come alls
Posted up, all black in the back, a hundred deep
A hundred coupes posted up in the front, two-hundred seats
Man somebody call the IRS, too many lambos
I'm talking bottles and blunts, all you can handle
Them other niggas fakin and flaugin'
Man them real niggas do real things, let's drink to that!

What I spent last night I could've bought a Range Rover
Got my Ray-bans on, yeah I see you haters
Keep doing what you doing, 'cause I need you haters
Say what's up to long stick, you can call it strong
If I had to name my money baby, I would call it long
Said I'm way too gone, I don't see nobody
I ain't even on the bill, I'm acting like it's my party
Smell like I'm on fire, oh I'm just that hot
If I smoke another blunt, yeah I swear I'm gonna die
You can call the weed man, tell him bring another six
Yeah I know he just left, he gotta make another trip
So hot in here, feel like I'm gon' faint
Even though I'm past my limit, still think I'm gonna drink

I'm way too gone, the best night of my life

I woke up early this morning
three white girls from the pink pony
I'm blowing money fast, so caught up in the moment
One time for the marks, two times for my homies
I'm a rock star every night, I'm a astronaut outta sight
Put Codeine in my Sprite, my wrist is full of ice
Don't even know her name, she so caught in the hype
It's OK baby, 'cause I'm a millionaire for life
I got bitches on my payroll, they comin' back like white
I'm with Ethiopian, we in Vegas shootin' dice
Got a girl at home, I know I'm wrong, it feels so right
On the first roll, young hope I roll a seven
We in the club for thugs, this must be heaven

Got her a Birkin bag, earrings for 40 G's

Got her that sexy condo, nothing can separate us

And now I reclaim this banner by god, my sword, and my name
In a truce sealed by blood within this metal skin and all that I own
Blood, bone, and courage in my veins, and the heart that pumps it

Drink from the chalice and be reborn
And the land with me, it will change and transform

A fighting, am sworn to the quest it is doom of man that they forget
I have awoken the dragon and all around me the mist of his breath

Always there where I least expect it, it will burn me to cinders

I know it's a bit embarrassing
But I just noticed some tan lines on your shirt

See, I reckon you're about an eight or a nine
Maybe even nine and a half in four beers' time
That blue Topshop top you've got on is nice
Bit too much fake tan, though, but yeah, you score high
But there's just one little thing that's really, really
Really, really annoying me about you, you see
Yeah, yeah, like I said, you are really fit
But my gosh, don't you just know it?

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

So when I looked at you standing there with your horde
I was waiting in the queue, looking at the board
Wondering whether to have a burger or chips
Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford
When I noticed out the corner of my eye
Looking toward my direction, your eyes locked onto my course
I couldn't concentrate on what I wanted to order
Which lost me my place in the queue I waited for, yeah

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Are you smoking crack or something?
Mike, just leave it, just leave it
We cannot have that behaviour in this establishment
It's not worth it, Mike, just leave it
Don't touch me
It's not worth it
Don't touch me, look, I'm alright, don't touch me

For a while there I was thinking, yeah, but, what if?
Picturing myself pulling with bare white hot wit
Snaring you as you were standing there opposite
Whether or not you knew it, I swear you didn't tick
And when that bloke in the white behind us lot queuing
Was clocking onto you, too, yeah, I had to admit
That yeah, yeah, you are fit and yeah, I do want it
But I stop sharking a minute to get chips and drinks

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Now, I bashed my head hard earlier due to the brew
But I am digressing slightly, so I'll continue
I didn't want to bowl over all geezer and rude
Not rude like good but just rude like uncouth
You girls think you can just flirt and it comes to you
Well let me tell you, see, yes, yes, you are really rude
And rude as in good, I knew this as you stood and queued
But I just did not want to give the satisfaction to you

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

And just as you started to make your big advance
With the milkshake and that little doughnut in hand
I was like, nah, I can't even though you look grand
But you look sharp there smiling hard suggesting and
Gleaming away with your hearty, hearty-looking tan
But I admit the next bit was spanner to my plan
You walked towards my path but just brushed right past
And into the arms of that fucking white shirted man

You were listening, their words are dull their syllables slow
But every day I have to call into this show

I'm a man who sits at his desk
So I guess I've got nothing to lose with this request
I want a girl who doesn't like to dress to impress

Turned up my lonely radio, I leave my job, sell what I own

Then you tuned in, not listening then I caught your ear when I said

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had to lose

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost
You don't know what love is

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing

And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
My senses have been stripped
May hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you

Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone
It's just escaping on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time
It's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you

Take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time
Far past the frozen leaves
The haunted frightened trees
Out to the windy bench
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky
With one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea
Circled by the circus sands
With all memory of fate
Driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me

Now toys are for boys, men don't need mattel
Objects to manipulate and sell
The women or the girls whichever name flip your curl
Acts for nonsense delivered by the boys of the world
But I!! i.. am.. totally ignorant to that type of pride
Yell, when your groin starts to rebel
Yo l, I told you that we would sell
Oversell to the point now, that the pockets, start to thicken
How in the world did women become chickens
Is it the, alize or the weed
Shredded on the tray, that make the queens flow this way?

No typical style, for the man who rules the genre
The opera, no choir boys, I'll direct your band
Change your tune for the man, and..

The two-car male and the male that needs mail
The woman start to, get empowered by alice walker
Waiting to inhale the fumes of the new yorker
Question - did you trust her, in front of pimps players
And hustlers, does she need a benz or a duster

Exhale, dangle in romance fiction
The love test, is like do you need to understand
Don't cram, you need a real man, and..

Does that mean respect, voiced by franklin, ignored by the inept
Baggy pants wearer, million man march bearer

Do we really maim the beautiful ones
The sons similak by anger, while the women get shunned
It's above me, another cop out, another rot out
Swapping +tears for fears+, while we +shout+ out
Past pain, that reverberates the claim
That the disrespect started when we, were in chains
Could be - but should be, it wouldn't be, if we

And even then, women must know which is which
When their groins itch, for the rich damn

Gonna to do his own thing g,

Back in the day, I had no luxury,
That never stopped because of ma bravery,
You get shook when you're ne-are me 
Asher D telling ma life story.

Spin keys make money for centuries,
Had doe and enough when I spend ma g?s,
People on ma back always wanting freebies,
Get out of ma face, 

Watch me on T.V.
Listen you don't really want to see me, 
When it's dark outside and I'm angry,
I grow up wishes for girls like a genie,

I press in the car with my CD's,
I'm stack in my car in my TT,
I'm bus big up show you want to see me,
Danger when you're ne-are me, 
You can't hear me, but you feel me.

Why d'you really want to imitate me? 
Why d'you really want to imitate me? 
Why is that you just want to be me,
But you can't see that you're the only one to the scene.

She shaved her body for a play
You know she looked so very fine
I just can't get her off my mind.

I saw Theresa yesterday
She told me ""Everything's okay,
I'm so in love with you today""

Theresa asked me to commit
I think that I could go with it
I never thought I'd have a wife
But I could see her in my life.

I saw Theresa yesterday
She told me ""Everything's okay,
But I'm leaving you today""

The night I climb toward the sky,
Above the city lights I'll fly
How can I live without that girl?
I wanted her inside my world.

I just wanna be
I don't wanna be another spoke in your wheel
Do you know what I mean?

now it appears the time we go our separate ways
In truth I wish sometimes we'd forego those plans you made
It's unacceptable to me that nothing can be done
To save two lovers from impending separation

We'll need help
Will such a distance serve to make our love secure,
Or will it go the way so many have before?

Tug my heartstrings one more time, oh no
Remember when you snuck in through his bedroom window
Or socks I found beside the bed that weren't mine or yours?
It's been too long since you've been honest with me baby.

I'll help you down off that high-horse you're on
And if you don't care I'm out of here by dawn
It doesn't matter, I don't love you anyway,
But this whole thing would make a heck of a story
Just suppose I told it right here right now. . .

You were waiting for me after school
We weren't worried about what to do
We walked to the coffee shop to talk
The hours passed by like minutes in New York.

We were in love once as we both well know,
But you have stayed and I have grown
Treat me like I have a clue in my head
'cause all along I knew you was playin' on someone else.



",The Love Story,2001
The Gabe Dixon Band,"There's a window that overlooks the sea
Where someone on a tiny ship is calling out to me.
I've dreamt of rainbows and golden fields
But never has more beautiful a vision been revealed.

The seagulls and the pelicans hovered round her sails
And up from the ocean came the dolphins and the whales.
She smiled at them all and then she turned to me.
I knew then that I would fall for the beauty of the sea.

Green-blue water sparkles
White lace dancing with sea wind
Sun-kissed lovers playing
Won't go back to being friends

I've got you in my life today
I pray you'll never go away
There's no place I would rather be
Than with my beauty of the sea.

I swim out to meet you in the bay
And as I climb aboard your ship, the red sun sinks away.
If I return, it will be with you.
For now we'll sail the sea of life in a boat built for two.

Green-blue water sparkles
White lace dancing with sea wind
Sun-kissed lovers playing
Won't go back to being friends

I pray you'll never go away

Than with my beauty of the sea.

When there's so much madness to be found,
When my mind is finally halfway sound.
I will wait for you love. Come around.

Life was simpler without you here
When your problems didn't reach my ear.
I will borrow you for this night
And to sorrow we will say goodbye.

When there's so much madness to be found,
When my mind is finally halfway sound.

And are victims to the evil choice,
Can we rise from this darkness yet?
Can we live our lives without regret?

Tell 'em I'll be waiting for that sunny day
Look at me I'm struggling, I just can't find my way

When I had a simple dream
There you were not saying a word
All I heard was our heart beating.

You were bent on picking apples from the apple tree
When you glanced my way.
With a hand you blocked the sun from your eyes and
Smiled an everlasting smile.
It was so unfortunate
That my alarm clock told me

you're just a dream
You're just a dream
You're just a dream,
But I'd just love to make you real.

you're just a dream
You're just a dream
You're just a dream
But I'd just love to make you real.

Next night I saw the end of
Bloody miscommunication.
All the sides they
Dropped their weapons and they
Drooped their heads in shame and clarity.
All of us who watched from the sidelines
Breathed a sigh.
Then I awoke and saw the paper with the people dying on the cover.

And things will all fall into place.

Baggy pants and flowers in your hair
Pockets full of poppy seeds

To be revealed.

Your fiery lioness
I'd be satisfied.

So would you please allow?
There's never been a better time than now.

Looking so sweet so innocent,
You could fool the sharpest eyes
But I'm not so ignorant
Of what it is you try to hide.
We're all just creatures on a rolling ball off course.
Of course we need the love.

Thinking about the ways
That you amaze the hell out of me.

And I face forward and wonder why, wonder why.

And then I'm setting this whole thing on fire

And I'm burning up the night she died
And I'm putting every last picture aside
I'm gonna say what I need to say
In my very last letter to you

'Cause you always made it clear
Said that you'd never be my pain
So here's to you and your bright baby blues
And just a pause to cool the refrain

And you said you were satisfied
And now this body's just waiting to die
And that you missed him sometimes but you said it's alright
It's just a whole lot harder alone

But I wish you knew her now
She's a better side of me now
And I'm doing the best I can
It's what you wanted

And I see you like you were there
And I know just how you'd smile
Mary, you looked just like it was 1930 that night

But here the days will eat you alive
But I won't give in tonight
You said it's not worth my time
And not to regard them

And not to settle just for piece of mind
But I can wait it out all night
If you'll just keep breathing

But Mary I found a sound
And this heart keeps pouring it out
And the glory hasn't come and it's probably gonna fade 
Like a tattoo that hides the shame 

And the reasons always fade
And the pain gets out some day
So I'm saying my goodbyes to your deep blue eyes
'Cause I don't know how to say, ""Stay still in the pain.
Stay still in the pain.""

She's a better side of me now
And I'm doing the best I can
It's what you wanted

Mary, you looked just like it was 1930 that night

But your name just escapes me tonight.""",1930,2007

Tellin' me ""He's only looking for fun""

And this was the sound of the very last gang in town
As heard by my wild young heart like directions on a cold dark night
Sayin' ""Let it out, let it out, let it out 
You're doin' all right.""

And I heard it in his chain gang soul
How it wasn't just the same sad song
Sayin' ""Let it out, let it out, let it out
You're doin' all right.""

And I carried these songs like a comfort wherever I'd go
And they was there when my summers was high 
And there when she left me alone.
Saying, ""the soul is hard to find""

And I never got to tell him so I just wrote it down
I wrapped a couple chords around it and I let it come out
When the walls of my bedroom trembled around me
This ramshackle voice over attack of a blues beat
And a girl, on the excitement gang

And this was the sound of the very last gang in town
As heard by my wild young heart like directions on a cold dark night
Sayin', ""Let it out, let it out, let it out 
You're doin' all right.""

And I heard it in his chain gang soul
How it wasn't just the same sad song
Sayin', ""Let it out, let it out, let it out

The Gaslight Anthem,"All hope abandon, ye who enter here
Said the sign I read that was hangin' above her bed
And the sirens all were wailin', but a man can ignore the signs
Gotta keep a good eye on the windin' road ahead

And my first sin was a young American girl
My first sin was a young American girl

And I spent time 'neath the trestles
With the punks and the dime store saints
Kept faith and a switchblade stuffed beneath my coat
And I ran with dirty angels, slept out in the rain
We were scared and tired and barely 17

And my first sin was a fear that made me old
My first sin was a fear that made me old

Now I walk down by the shipyards
Near the place where I was born

By the light on the Navesink banks
Sayin' ""Listen baby, I know you now""

The Gaslight Anthem,"I was born in a town where the rivers flow free
On a January night when the cold winds freeze
I got an Irish name and an injury
A blessing and a curse cast down on me

Ain't nobody got the blues like me
Ain't nobody got the blues like me

It was a blood red sky on the morning tide
There was a cold wind blowin' when I left that night
And the warning bells rang, all right, all right
Shoulda stayed home with you that night

Ain't nobody played the fool like I
Ain't nobody played the fool like I

Things got bad and things got worse
Half like a blessing, half like a curse
Seems a blessing's so hard to see sometimes
Got a little clearer 'bout dusk last night

Ain't nobody got a blessing like mine
Ain't nobody got a blessing like mine

And it was all completely wrong, Virginia
You were much too much for me
I was a boy on the lawn, with his eyes to the sky
You were Garbo, smoke, and deceit

And it was Saturday, September, and fire
It was a backdrop set in your smile
It was all I could want in the sway of the song
I was haunted for so many years

Let it ride, let it ride, let it roll off your mind
Don't say a single world, get back inside
Let me drive, let me drive, disappear in the night

Never, never, never bring me back to your mind
Let it slide, slide, roll off your mind
Like I was a movie you'd seen

And it was all just a crime, Virginia
Let your fire be mercy to me
I was a boy in your arms, safe in your arms
And you swore like a promise to me

That I would never, never, never leave your heart
No I would never, never, never leave your heart
But where are you now, I can still feel you now 
And I hear all your songs in the breeze

Don't say a single world, get back inside

I look to my left and I look to my right

Am I alone?

Did they fall down by the wayside?
Was I movin' too blind to see them?
Were they callin' out to me?
Or did despair set in?

Were the things that we wanted when we were still 16
Only passing and fleeting or just too far out of reach?
Were you hard up or broken man, I woulda helped you out
Were you numb and distracted when I was calling out?
I was calling out

On a Sunday morning the whole crowd assembled
I've done some things that I'm not too proud of

About the rain on the pavement and the sound as it fell

And I learned about the blues from this kitten I knew
Her hair was raven and her heart was like a tomb

I saw tail lights last night in a dream about my old life
Everybody leaves, so why, why wouldn't you?

Better safe than making the party

And the waiter served my coffee with a consolation sigh.
You remind Anna, if she asks why.
Tell her it's all right.

Oh it's hard to tell you this.

The Gaslight Anthem,"So the ambulances came
They took your pulse and packed up your things
And the papers read
Some boys forget what the heartache brings

And the pounding in the street
Was your heart in four-four time
And the taste of defeat
Was never too far from your mind

And Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
I always kinda sorta wished I looked like Elvis
And in my head there's all these classic cars and outlaw cowboy bands
I always kinda sorta wished I was someone else

And stole the temple that the schoolboys praised
And the crowd shuffled in
You're getting drinks for the same boys who once bought you everything

And the powder on the bar was just this one time
The patter on the bar was just this one night
And only to get by

And at night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
It's a pretty good song, baby you know the rest

The Gaslight Anthem,"Like Miles Davis, I've been swayed by the cool
There's just something 'bout the summertime, there's just something 'bout the moon
So I laid a kiss on a stone, tossed it upside your window by the roof
Before you change your mind, Miles, bring in the cool

Honey, put on your red dress and your diamond-soled shoes
Climb on out from that window, climb on out of your room
'Cause I never had a good thing and I always had the blues
But I heard that you always kinda wondered, Miles, strike up the cool

Don't wait too long to come home
My, how the years and our youth passed on
Don't wait too long to come home
I will leave the front light on
And the night is our own
Don't wait too long

Like poor Mr. Pitiful, I can't turn you loose
You move like a dream I had, I woke up sweating in my room
But your mama's got plans and your daddy's aim is true
She never understood that it ain't no good, papa never heard the cool

So now I've got up my nerve and found me a stone
With a flick of the wrist and a turn of the key, you'll just fall in my arms

My, how the years and our youth passed on
Don't wait too long to come home
I will leave the front light on

The Gaslight Anthem,"If I could write,
I'd tell you how much I've missed these nights
Where we'd dig around the bones
And try to find peace and patches for the holes

I lit a cigarette on a parking meter
The corner boys told her how I was dyin' to meet her
Like a prayer I said on a dead man's knee
You drove up like a parade

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos,
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos,
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart straight in my arms

Fell straight in my arms

And I miss it sometimes
Shakin' like a leaf on the corner of Vine
But I heard it's alright
The radio spoke to a good friend of mine

And I can feel it comin' up as the night's gettin' warm
I saw your summer dress hangin' on the back of the lawn
Like a dream I remember from an easier time
With the top rolled down on a Saturday night

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart right in my arms
Right in my arms

And I always dreamed of classic cars and movie screens
And tryin' to find some way to be redeemed
Bring a dollar with you, baby
In the cold, cold ground

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above, these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart, you fell straight in my arms.

You fell straight in my arms.",Old White Lincoln,2008

Look what you've forgotten here

And they cut me to ribbons and taught me to drive

I called for my father but my father had died
While you told me fortunes, in American Slang

The fortunes came for the richer men.
While we're left with gallows,

And here's where the angels and devils meet.

And wore all your old welcomes out

The Gaslight Anthem,"Sixteen years,
Sixteen banners united over the field
Where the good shepherd grieves.
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves.

Fortune calls.
I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace,
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down.
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born,
On midsummer's eve, near the tower.

The cold-blooded moon.
The captain waits above the celebration
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid
Whose ebony face is beyond communication.
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.

They shaved her head.
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo.
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale.
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow,
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.

I stumbled to my feet.
I rode past destruction in the ditches
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo.
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.

The palace of mirrors
Where dog soldiers are reflected,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
The empty rooms where her memory is protected,
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.

She wakes him up
Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks.
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.

Gentlemen, he said,
I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes,
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards
But Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.

Peace will come
With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire
But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating

And I met you between the wax and the needle and the words of my favorite song
And your black hair was like a raven to your tanned skin over the beach
And your back drop with your rollers and my side kick was all discrete

And I’ve been so locked down, I’ve been long lost level on the ground

She had come to choose some pretty dancing shoes
And he heard her say in a charming way

Shoes to set my feet a-dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing all the day
Shoes to set my feet a-dancing, dancing
Dancing all my cares away
(Then he tapped and he stitched for his fingers were bewitched)

And he sewed a dream into every seam
(Making shoes, oh, so neat just like magic on her feet)
And he hoped she'd know that he loved her so
But she danced, danced, danced as though she were entranced
Like a spinning top all around the shop
On her dainty feet she whirled into the street
And he heard her say as she danced away

Lei scarpini de bailare, bailare.
Bailaremos tutusi.
Lei scarpini de bailare, bailare.
Bailaremos con cosi.
Shoes to set my feet a-dancing, dancing
Dancing all my cares away

From the grape came the wine

From the vine came the grape

He would cry

Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger

To win the race? A prettier face!
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
But today the way I play the game is not the same 
No way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take

Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy
What a kick just a buddy and me
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race
Got out of the place
I went back home got a brand new face
For the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change
Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don't think that I'll be back again
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take

Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get

I say that's what you get

That's what you get for changing your mind

And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes
Do not make the man

I'll hold on to my freedom
May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be
Lose the face now 
I've got to live",Freedom,1998

Sweatin' all the bitches to blow are weanies
Niggaz all getting drunk, and smoking a bum bud
Oh wait here's a punk, pump the trunk
'cause it's a gang of jackers in the front smoking
All the hump, some shit was said about blue and red
But I'm color blind and I gotta nine
Threw up the sign I cock the 9, I cock the 9.

Well nigga pop the 9and let it holla
Test drive wit a neighborhood's scholar
Black Impaler, blue chucks on gettin outta
Sucks on hip hop thugsta get the fuck on
Niggaz looking shifty, do they want to diss me, lick me
Show me love or peel my cap quickly
My six sense won't let me slip don't puff wit the draggin' 'em
I'm still toe taggin em, hit the spot wit a don still baggin' 'em
It's the low call, S.A.B on the vocal, blast my way out eazy pay

Have to hide my heart

I will show the world
What's inside my heart

Or the Ebola Virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Un-loyal snakes get thrown in boilin' lakes
Of hot oil, it boils your skin, chicken heads gettin' slim
Like Olive Oyl, only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential, vitamin and mineral
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffin' clouds inside my pillow
Rollin with the Lands, the tribe's a hundred and forty four thousand chosen
Protons electrons always cause explosions

The banks of G, all CREAM downs a vet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see, my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax free shit by any means
Whether bound to hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such with cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like hams
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded, and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the limp on temp
With the stump, treat his hips like air pumps
RZA shaped the track, niggaz caught razor bumps
Scarred tryin to figure who invented
This unprecented, opium-scented, dark-tinted
Now watch me blow him out his shoes without clues
Cause I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short fuse",4th Chamber,1995

Life is a test many quest the universe
And through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt
The first shall be last and the last shall be first
The basic instructions before leaving earth

Knowledge this wisdom, this goes back when I was twelve
I loved doing right but I was trapped in hell
Had mad ideas, sad eyes and tears
Years of fears, but yo my foes couldn't bear
I searched for the truth since my youth
And went to church since birth, but it wasn't worth the loot
That I was paying, plus the praying
I didn't like staying cuz of busy-bodies and dizzy hotties
That the preacher had souped up with lies
Had me cooped up lookin at loot, butt, and thighs
Durin the service, he swallowed up the poor
And after they heard this, they wallowed on the floor
But I ignored, and explored my history that was untold
And watched mysteries unfold
And dropped a jewel like Solomon, but never followed men
Cause if you do your brain is more hollow than
Space oblivia, or the abyss
With no trace of trivia, left with the hiss
Does it pay to be deaf, dumb and blind?
From a slave we was kept from the mind
And from the caves he crept from behind
And what he gave, was the sect of the swine
When the bible, it condemns the pig
I don't mean to pull your hems or flip your wigs
But we used to wear a turban, but now we're in the urban
No more wearing beanies and dress like a genie
No hocus pocus cause I focus on the facts
And put it on the tracks and brought it through the wax
I speak on Jacob, it might take up some time
And too much knowledge, it might break up the rhyme
I did it anyway just to wake up the mind
Of those who kiss stones or prays on the carpet
Those who sit home, or sell books by the market
Need to chill and get their mind revived
For years religion did nothing but divide

I strolled through the books of Job to unfold
And open bibles, instead of hoping on revivals
Calling on His name and screaming hallelujah
When he hardly knew ya, that's how the devil's fooled ya
See look into my eyes brethren, that's the lies of a Reverend
Why should you die to go to heaven?
The Earth is already in space, the bible I embrace
A difficult task I had to take
I studied till my eyes was swollen, and only arose when
I found out that we were the chosen
I deal with the truth, and build with the youth
And teach my son as he kneels on the stoop
Son, life is a pool of sin, corrupted with foolish men
And women with wicked minds, who build picket signs
To legalize abortion, the evil eye distortion
I quiz Son with my wisdom
Before I converted, I was perverted, and knowledge was asserted
The study of wisdom, I preferred it
The understanding, it gave me mental freedom
I even learned Caucasians were really the Tribe of Edom
The white image, of Christ, is really Cesare Borgia
And uhh, the second son of Pope Alexander
The Sixth of Rome, and once the picture was shown
That's how the devils tricked my dome
I prophesized to save a man, but no one gave a damn
For my nation the seed of Abraham
Blessed with the tongue of Hebrew
Now we're strung on needles, and some are plungin evils
So study and be wise in these days of darkness
Peace to my nephew Marcus

In this cold, cold world

It was the night before New Year's, and all through the fuckin' projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec
Outside as I'm stuck, by enemies who put fear
And blasted on the spot before the pigs were dere
You know hoods robbers snipers new in sight, fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fuckin' lights
Gunshots, shatter first floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether broke callisthetic, any style you set it
Beat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Links was snatched off necks, scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made em fold
And squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Destruction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hangin' from his Farmer's
And it's bugged how some niggas catch slugs
And pockets dug from everything except check stubs
And it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggas layin' on roof tops
For his CREAM he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
You don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae, increase the murder rate
Similar to hit men who pull out Tecs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican
Rapid, like recipients cashin' checks again
Back to the motherfuckin' spot on Lexington

And seize packages and pocket the currency
Clicks control strips full clips are sprayed
Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay

And I stays harassed, scramblin' for petty cash
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learnin' fast
357's and 44's
Bought inside corner stores, their fire sparks the wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
'Cause niggas main concern is CREAM
Some niggas in the jet black Gallant
Shot up the Chinese restaurant, for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead but instead he missed a kid
And hit a twelve year old girl in the head and then fled
Tactical narcotic, task force, back off fast
'Cause the crime boss is passin' off cash
Extortions, for portions of streets, causes beef
Havin' followers of Indians trying to play Chief

Of a modern day opera, where the main character

Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Duckin handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move lioke real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Building lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, keys in they vaginas

Like the crash in the Dow Jones stock
I had a connect to cross-sales, to catch more mill's
Than ho-bitches got birth control pills

Peeped my convo, the address of my condo
And how I changed a nigga name to John Doe

And flows through, all they knew, he's gun sick

Mad sick, stand on hills and invade wars
Filthy foul, shovelling dirt, he's out to hurt
For instance, chop off hands, attack worth
His idols would lock down airports and extort
Some import, catching ten percent of what the fiends snort
Up in the ski resorts, up in hills
They move keys and had the skis making drops on snowmobiles
The plan was to expand, catch seven figures, release triggers
And live large and bigger than my nigga
Who promised his moms a mansion with mad room
She died and he still put a hundred grand in her tomb
Open wounds, he hid behind closed doors
And still organized his crime and drug wars

Along with briefcase filled with one point five, that's the bribe
Take it or commit suicide
First rule, anyone who schemes on the gold in Syria
I want they small intestines ripped from they interior
I got a price for those jewels, ship 'em freight cargo
Don't forget to launder the cream through Wells Fargo
Reconstruct those processing plants for the call of Costa Rica

Two hundred pounds of reefer and fifty immigrants with fake Visas

Wu brother number one, protect your neck
Flying guillotines here they come, bloody bastards
Hard times and killer tactics, spitting words plus
Semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle, hit the clutch
Shift the gear now, full throttle, time to bungee
To the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack, and spitting lunghies
At a whack nigga dat, don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat, killa hill projects
How to be exact, break it down
All in together now
Things are getting good looking better now",Shadowboxin',1995
The Genius,"When a motherfucker steps out his place
And gets slapped in his motherfuckin face
Just because the motherfucker tried to base
The G.O.D., the G.O.D
And while I see his whole clique pass us by
Motherfuckers think they qualify
And for those niggas want to try
The G.O.D., the G.O.D

Yo
I'm not caught up in politics
I'm no black activist on a so-called scholar's dick
I come through with the Wu and drop math
And versatile freestyle bombs and phonographs
And deliver, all things in number and weight
Searched to death, on how living things relate
Cause at a young age, I was molded in a religion I relied on
And got caught up in superstition
Scared to split pole, duck black cats
Once in a while, threw salt over my back
But with knowledge of self from off the shelf
Made things seemed complicated now small like elves
So turn off the lights, light a candle, and have a seance
Pull the lid off the Dean Martin scandal
Witches, warlocks, spooks and holy ghosts
RZA let's defraud the hoax

When a motherfucker steps out his place
And gets slapped in his motherfuckin face
Just because the motherfucker tried to base
The G.O.D., the G.O.D
And while I see his whole clique pass us by
Motherfuckers think they qualify
And for those niggas want to try
The G.O.D., the G.O.D

We were on the same ship when the slaves were checked
I had to pull your card, you was on the top deck
So I plotted my escape, I saw the thin line between love and hate
And fast from the hog on the plate
I suffered brutal pain, from whips and chains
Punishments that were set to wash the brain
So look listen observe and also respect this jewel
Drawed up, detect and reflect this
Light I shine, because my powers is refined
Through the truth, which manifest through eternal minds
Purified gases and masses the same elements
That helped spark civilization classes
I see brothers quote math plus degrees
Look at professor ass niggas can't feed they own seeds

When a motherfucker steps out his place
And gets slapped in his motherfuckin face
Just because the motherfucker tried to base
The G.O.D., the G.O.D
And while I see his whole clique pass us by
Motherfuckers think they qualify

The Genius [The Genius  the Genius] 



Verse One: Ol Dirty Bastard [GZA in brackets] 



I'll grab and the mic and now I damage you  cut your whole stamina 

Here comes the medical examiner 

One verse then you're out for the count 

[Bring the ammonia] make sure he sniffs the right amount 

Wake him up and then I ask him 

Why did he intend this -- 

competition to get an ass kickin so tremendous 

Boy you shouldn't bother this 

Leave me alone like the [son said G or he'll be fatherless!] 

I got the asiatic flow mixed with disco 

Roll up on the scene like the Count of Monte Crisco 

and MC's start to vanish 

[I stepped up to a jet black kid, started speakin spanish! 

Yo he wasn't from Panama 

I asked him how he get so dark, the nigga said suntama! 

He responded so fast, you made me laugh] 

Ha-ha-ha, HARARRRH [then I scared-his ass!] 

[Kick the hundred strongest rhymes 

I brought out the punk in him 

Caught him with a strong five deadly venom 

Told him enter the Wu-Tang 

Witness the Shaolin slang, that'll crush the shit you bring] 

I watch your ass take a big fall, why?! 

My Main Source, is like a friendly game of stickball 

And as you step up to bat man [I play the riddler] 

You try to do me for a rhyme [then I'll change to Hitler] 

Go out like Nazi; you'll be wishin your fuckin ass stayed 

home and played [Yahtzee!] 

Or watchin Happy Days sweatin [Poxie] 

with Ralphie and Richie Cunningham, Joni and [Chachi] 

Wu, who? Me gettin wreck so I'm through 

Like a ten and a half foot, gettin in a seven [shoe] 

[Now picture THAT with a Minolta] 

Have your ass doin some Night Fever shit like John Travolta

and rock on from P.M. [past the fucking Dawn] 

Pass the Hammer you're broke down, niggaz grab my what what

[A complete view of how I defeat you] 

Should of stepped to those fuckin kids who tried to [beat you] 

Yeah I bust that ass before 

[You ran to Texas and came back but forgot the chainsaw!] 

And want to perform a massacre 

Better be coming with some motherfucking shit that's spectacular 

Crush the person who did em, well you just better 

So I'm stepping to your [raggedy ass jetta] 

Put the pedal to the metal 

You and your DJ change your name to Ma and Pa Kettle 

as I [pass the bone, kicks your every measure] 

It's not a Newport but it's still live with pleasure 

[C'mon don't be silly, just a bag of sensimilli 

Rolled up in a] Motown Philly 

[I used to write all the time when I smoked 

Grab the mic, then I kinda like went for broke 

With visually concepts strongest rhymes and biceps 

Lyrically speakin, three to four rhymes then choke 

Some think they be harmin this, claimin they be bombin this] 

But they still remains a-nom-ynous 

I pull strings like Jimi Hendrix 

Ride more beats that go backs to the days of Eddie Kendricks 

I teach the truth to the youth, I say [hey youth] 

Here's the truth, better start wearing [bullet proof] 

Arm yourself with a shield 

[Before you get trapped up] just like the Children in the Cornfield",Damage,1995
The Genius,"When the MCs came to live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Yo RZA flip the track with the what to cut

Fake niggas get flipped
In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
On some wild out shit, to insert a fiend
But it was your op the shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rolling smart
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirt
That's minimum, and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my clan in the front want it

When the MCs came to live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Yo RZA flip the track with the what to cut

I'm on a mission that niggas say is impossible
But when I swing my swords they all choppable
I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
Child educator, plus head amputator
Cause niggas styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
Round the clock, that state pen time check it
With the pens I be sticking but you can't stick to crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin

When the MCs came to live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born

The Genius,"It's the visiting king  supreme  all heal kiss the ring 
Into a ?  I blow steam from the families of the Mackabees 
Smack emcees watch them scream your majesty  make them suffer 
The capacity of tragedy  hold the crowd down like gravity 
Back the fuck off  stop grabbing me  hands off me  niggas start to 
Bore me 

I'm getting sleepy  I need some coffee, me and my wu-bandits 
We carry niggas deep in the canvas, body bandage, like some mummies 
You fucking dummies, you can't take nothing from me 
It's the longest waited, the most anticipated, the album amputated 
Scream the name out Killah Priest, I leave the blood filling in the 
Street 

I'm from the dark hills of Brownsville, the seven shields on windmills 
Across the killing fields, never forget it, tell them rap critics 
I speak in horrific, so they can never get it, I'm too scientific 
Lyrics explicit, I roll with thirsty niggas, theifs and killers 
Tigers, gorillas, faces like godzilla 

We stomp rappers and smile like a Calm-Della, we got iller 
Cross my heart both hope to die, we multiply, by the hundred 
Fuckin' by the thousand, leave me out ? so grounded 
Beatin' up your soundman 
Playa haters and players, we give um' cold stares 
Any last prayers

Yo, Yo, concrete techniques, bomb beats and cause causalities 
My facalty, hold it down like gravity, rapidly 
Sweatin' like weapons to adolescence, ghetto residence 
Quick to pass since your present, state of the slum 
Kill 4 play the drums 
Face 1, their course was now, the snake tongue, I'm deep into this 
I sometimes gasp for air, deadly warfare 
Hot block cop and gold stares, shots clear 
They fire was on July the 4th, weapons get torn, fugitive slidin' off 
My force is combined, new world, 2009 
Digital, criminals you'll make meals in cyber-crime 
Let's all plan ahead, 2 times, I keep the chimes to a great mind 
The head that you take, you're not blind

[Chorus]
We stare you eye to eye 
We tell the truth no lie 
We cross our heart and hope to die, hope to die

High ranked officials and armed tanks with missiles, blood drizzle 
Simple fact, you slept on the issue, that B-boy started jerkin 
Joysticks a Sega, I was rockin' off 100 watt amps in ?, 2 fine tune it 
Ship enough units, emcees ask, who be those rhyme killers in mask 
No doubt, difficult task, the last in the square, beware 
Infinite amount of darts is in the air, I'm victorious 
With no opponents, I blast through components, with micro-phonics 
Watch the whole world live the moment, anything in time 
Became approaching this, are incompatible of speech, remains motionless 

[Chorus: x2]

Hope to die",Cross My Heart,1998
The Genius,"Yeah, perverted monk representin'
You know what I'm sayin'?

No need for cappin' this, brave boys, I break your back with this
Practice, math this, lyrical theatrics
You'll never, ever brave the weather, I'm too clever
Conjurin sandstorms, I'll freeze ya then I'll melt ya
You know I dealt the, on impact, shots hit the ceiling
These [Incomprehensible], I'm wieldin', straight echoes through the building

Enemies efforts are foreseen in the mental
I make steel wrinkle at the blink of a eye
Terminate, unrighteous conscious states
Imitate the stars while they constellate
The heart rate of my social eloquence makes sense
Intense, with the roughage, you couldn't budge this
Mountainous, type of figure
So check it out, now you know when you lookin' at a real nigga

You know we rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle, which rapper thinkin' they the nicest
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless

You eggshell niggas get cracked in half
My armed force throw a road block in your path
Beats smash from True Mast, my shots blast
Shatter glass, crowd watch, the sound sets clash
Quick fast, I let the darts off, with no doubt
Your bitch ass, you head north and break out
The snakes out, hissin', shots missin', observe and respect and listen
And if you get stung twice, that means he's rollin' wit loaded dice
It's like gettin' stabbed with ice and watch the evidence melt
Immediately the blow is felt

Commissioner revoke the belt, the microphone
Microphone flower, fresh shower
Of the rugged garments, break the bread like Noah
I'm holdin', ride the 808 rollin'
Write til my hand's swollen, your no comp ya
Huh, I stomp ya, the monster
Worldwide record launcher, multiply and conquer

You know we rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle, which rapper thinkin' they the nicest
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless

We rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle, which rapper thinkin' they the nicest
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless

Nemesis, bringer of disaster
With more moves than the Tai Chi Master
Killa and I get illa, cerebral warlord
My name's Afu-Ra, step too quick and your thought's floored
Fury portrayed, sharper than the fuckin' cactus
Conquerin' globes and universes with Galactus

Tongue lashes, it rattles, never sliver
Optimus Prime, fatal bites as I deliver
Lyrically deadly, mic flow heavenly
In dwellin' intelligence, choose my weaponry
Battle strategy, bishop cover angles
Knights move next, L shapes, the vortex
Forces break down, now I got the nitty gritty
You think it's a stalemate but now I'm yellin' checkmate
Ultra rhymer, stop breaths like anacondas

You know we rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle, which rapper thinkin' they the nicest
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless

We rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle, which rapper thinkin' they the nicest
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless

Feed the hungry MCs and be starving as hell
I laid the first verse and quenched a dry ass niggaz thirst
Who drank my wisdom up like water, till his stomach burst
Full tank, with the premium quallity raps

Welcome to the Jungle where the cat loves to scratch 
The rat squeals 
And the polar bear feasts on the blubber of seals 
The pack of wolves be scheming on a bunch of gazelles 
Where the leopards grab the wilderbeast down by it's tail 
You see the chimps they grow hips they hustle and sling in trees 
Elephants for security that move tons of leaves 
The bluebirds arrest parrots that love to talk 
or eagles that stalk fresh-water trout under the wing of the hawk 
You see the vultures pick the pocket of whatever remain 
In the brain we watch but a shadow of the lion's mane 
Whose roar is loud enough to take the stripes from a zebra 
He camouflage his bets and his spots of a cheetah 
Shouldn't gamble with a cheetah and not expect to get beat 
You silly goose you know he move fast on his feet 
Now you're neck deep in depth with a bunch of lone sharks 
So you move on a colony of ants with aardvarks, you see 
Most of the everglades controlled by the gators 
It was crashed by the crocs who came years later 
See the locusts had swarmed with the bees 
the tick moved with the fleas 
The dragonflies and the wasps shared with the seas 
The crab and the leeches sucked your blood flow 
And they laugh like hyenas when they out to catch dough 
See a million mosquitos from the West now 
Carrying the virus that made the boars less wild 

[Hook x4 : GZA]
It's like the jungle sometimes 

[GZA]
Out of fear of the deer watch for the eye of the tiger 
The Clutch from the Cobra and the venomous viper 
Boa-constrictors that cut your circulation 
Mosts of their prayers die from broke bones and suffocation 
The owls are private eyes that watch from the bark 
Black panthers are the militant who strike in the dark 
Porcupines had a rep' for sticking everything that moved 
In areas that the rhinos and hippos approved 
And the giraffe was a look-out for gorillas in the mist 
And the bats use their sonar to guide and assist 
Those pelicans who smuggle contraband for the whale 
While the skunks spray the scent to keep the dogs off the trail 
The scorpion set up a sting for sly foxes 
that use stool pigeons just to keep them in the boxes 
While the black widow laid a web for the bachelor 
like daddy-long-leg and his hype man, tarantula 
They both prey on grasshoppers beetles and flies 
And they all become instant meals the moment it dies 
What costs little, is a little worth 
so some lose they lives wandering on the wrong turf 
From birth they grow up walking the thin line 
It's like the jungle sometimes

I was born, with the mic in my hand
Then I took it from Medina, to the S.I. land
I pulled up on the block, go out the truck, tt was the first of pit stops
The era of the spinnin' tops, the birth of hip hop
That was somethin', I had identified with
So I, made it my point to exploit this fly gift then
Myself and RZA, made trips to the B.X.
A mass of ferocious M.C.'s and talent T-Rex
Giants in every ways, rap flows for every day
We knew we would get a reward for the price we'll pay
The basic training was beyond entertainment
Just the caters of the verbal expressions, self explainin'
Were my boots out in constant walks across the borough
Tore the troops out the frame when they challenge the most thorough
From well concealed firing positions we let off the most
Dangerous with that, slang that just shatter the coast
They say I rhyme like the bank that stop
Cause M.C.'s be more shook then the dice that drop
Especially if I'm rollin', then the point is definitely proven
Cause with the GZA holdin', that keep a nigga movin'
I walk Broadway, from Quincy to Myrtle
Back to Quincy, cut careers whatever the expense be
They heard the Legend, run to the reverend
With headaches and blackouts, worse then severe seven

[Chorus: GZA]
And when my job is done
And it's time to get those that's comin' up some runs
So you can see where they from, from, from...
They say the product is good
We gonna sling it from the slums of the hills of the hood
'Til it's understood

[GZA]
We still search through the crates of songs that just breaks
At times we play legendary battles on tapes
Unlikely confrontation with a clash of swords
In a G that was stored, be rain that just poured
On cats and dogs, water that, flooded the stance
The violence and nature had trigged the violence of man
That was bloodshed, from which said, audible threats
Publicize regrets, wanted alive or dead
A hand full recovered from the dramatic plunge
While the rest kept babblin' and speakin' in tongues
Since the competition already slaked them in a scrimmage
He continued tarnish that, already faded image
Any sport, when they come short, majors don't need 'em
Then they broke, lose they homes, lively hood and freedom
The rhyme could be a blunt object that make you choke
Like too many tokes, that'll recharge in growth
This Witty Unpredictable Talent or Natural Game
With non added of slang, it's all actual fact
The high roller knock the chip off the shoulder
Strike like the perfect bowler, with catastrophic damage
My other's hard to vanish, punishment, swift to sudden
Unparalleled advantage, brought to a level where you froze and can't speak
Trapped in the frigid temperatures of that peak

[Chorus]",Auto Bio,2002
The Genius,"I keep your heart is PZA-pumping, the beat is GZA-jumping
The crowd get wild off my style, they want something
The herds start stomping, the promoters that be fronting
They sue for Cash Rule but the courts they give 'em nothing
Your soundman came with the feedback like we need that
Security's shining flashlights like where the weed at?
Stay in your place, see you guys smoke blowing in your face
And it's hard to stop it once we came to drop it

Who bold enough to challenge this deadly reportation
Of keeping MC's in a hopeless situation
No comparison, if you put the darts side by side
One will weigh out the other like friend next to brother
Try to take cover as the battle comes to a closion
That structure that supported your rap started implosion
Your whole chest and your world caved in
They completely gave in, they just sparks and brave men

Did ya say that?
Record execs wanna push the album way back
And hold out on my advance
They didn't pay that

Raindrops keep falling on your head
So heavy that it's tearing what you're wearing
Ain't caring, so you're hearing what I said
I'm making sure it stick like a stamp you don't lick
Or a snare with no kick, so you know it be authentic
Like the hand-made works of a carpenter
The 64 squares make 'em use a sharpener

Kept a fine point with the lead, then it's thread
On the paper then like cancer it would rapidly spread
This music is addictive but can't live without it
At times you shout it 'The Wu, they be about it'
A strong following with the die-hard supportedly
The loyalty came from the songs that went accordingly
I couldn't be more wrong if I changed the format
Did something different from the most explored rap

Did ya say that?

Positive elevation always correct errors
That's the fire till my Clansmen starts to spread terror
Spin your wig back like we DJ'ing, he ain't playing
My songs set a trap, catch 'em laying
Now we stuck but he's overwhelmed by what he came across
Not to play it is a terrible loss at whose cost?
People wait like never before for the ball to drop
At the gate lined up for a tape to cop

I still run into students banging my first joint
Wrote a essay off the second LP to prove a point
That a rhyme is a terrible thing to waste
Gimmicks and radio, the God don't chase
But I replace your wackness, it shows in your flows
Immaturenesses, all of your hoes, case closed
Most of your strength is in the pocket of your clothes
That you endorse in every rhyme like it's Garbeson robes

Did ya say that?
Record execs wanna push the album way back
And hold out on my advance
They didn't pay that

I grew up around block parties ready to rock
Behind a roll nigga wit my rhyme on cock
First shot first nigga who had shit to pop
My bad weather blew the feathers off a hundred flocks
Seventy precent goose, thirty duck
Get stuck if each link in ya chain is truck
Can't come in this rhyme cypha wit nine snipers
Charged off the juice from the pied pipers
Walk around B-Boys, DJ's, MC's
Through rap, never thinkin their ways of TV
It was strictly all about about magnificent rhyme clout
The R.E.C. Room, two dollars with the flyer, three without
Now his wigs pushed back, name's removed off the plaque
Too wild to reanact, with tax
Thats the price to pay, my goal is to aim and spray

An MC stepped to me, lying about one
Kid that rolled with him who died in the outcome
Thinking he could get with me, gain victory
When the season's all on his beef was hickory
The situation at hand still remained critical
The check analytical, reaction was pitiful
He pushed his pawn up, yo that's a wrong move
A hog move, some rap cat on dog food
Microphone competition we devour
You pull plugs but take no source of power
Cause then in MCing, the contours of the land
Intricate architects that's linked to a plan
The W U hyphen T A N G
My rap flow automatic and never empty
Don't tempt me, quick to bust off another
Flee in that direction you could get it from my brother
At least then you know that you up against G-O-D
So when we throw those grenades you better be
Ready, not iced out and petty
Neckful couldn't match one oil drop from Getty
That's ran by the icon who just left Exxon
And spilled oil so he could cash checks on
The strength cause local niggas be hating
But the sound still travels from state to state and
No dress code, boot, hats and all metal
Strictly hip hop underground and all ghetto
So catch it, throw it on your plate and scratch it
Mix that [shit], y'all niggas can't do [shit]

How come so much rap [shit] sound so similar
Is it confusing for you to remember the
Originator, paint sprayer, crafts innovators
Quick close ups of the artform's life savors
From tapes to decks, beats with raps, streets with gats
Speaking of tracks, I've ran plenty laps
The crates were packed, Farms were Phat
Thieves would chat to stab my back, detect many traps
Hazardous enterprise, the youths energized
Not seeing the truth till it's in your eyes
Burning, you learning to power your rhyme
Exert maximum damage in minimum time
Road L's are lit, my spears start to hit
Strange translation of words of wit
Through the cable transmit' and once the shoe fit
Unlock the secret of prophecies and that's it
Stay submerged deep as we cruise the seas
Beneath the Surface just like Adidas and Lee's
Or a croke head that used to walked the length
From Brooklyn to get a beat on 43rd and 10th
And that's just a short trip to flip without a whip
Tried to shop this most extravagant gift
To a cat who wasn't hemped and never opened doors
Till he accidently seen it on the shelves of stores
That's more frightning than strikes of lightning
Tearing up the storm in your average college dorm
So think about it when you trying to flow
When you wanna step to us I think you should know

Moving at colossal speeds, they crush an emcee
Since this rap region is heavily packed with stars
Internal mirror in the telescope, noticed the Czar

From far away, they blink as the lightnin' strolled
Great distance of space between precise globes
That travel in a circle of order
Like the tape in your cassette recorder filled with cult for slaughter

The hitman for hire, weapon in his hand he lurks
Inspite of the strange appearance he laid a clearance

This is a tale of a town with the population
Of approximately two thousand people
They small close in their community with crime
And murder, we're virtually unheard of
With front doors, were always left unlocked
A place where mayhem only happens in your wildest dreams
Boy...

[GZA]
For some, the sun will never come out tomorrow
Like those in this heart pounding tale of random horror
Of a body count, after trashin' it, they done with it
Victims inflicted with passionate punishment
Specific offers of horrific torture
That left crime scenes, that retired law enforcers
This ruthlessness knew no bounds, as he beat him down
Shot him while gagged and bound, kept the whole town
Shocked, with they doors locked, fire arms cocked
Major roads blocked, no one knows when he knocks
As a kid he killed three pets of an attorney
So his child passion became a life long journey
Grew into a world of destruction, abduction
Left many body parts flowin' on the Hudson
Whether fountain or ditch, after the ride you hitched
Screams is high pitched from scars you can't stitch
Mutilated and decapitated, white collar chicks
Just from his involvement in local politics
His outfit stained with the blood of the slain
While his backyard full of skeletal remains
His goal in life, was preparation for death
An autopsy showed affixation, loss of breath
Was it his fascination, for strangulation
The lynchings in the '20's was his inspiration
Unspeakable acts that made front page
Motivated by an unexplainable rage

""A suspected killer plaguing this community
Has once again eluded police and detectives""

Smashed a 12-year old Little League ball player skull, with a baseball bat""

The State psychologist, forensic pathologist
Warned the detective to search beyond the obvious
They ruled out the possibility that the killa be
Physically fit with athletic ability
Talley and murder, on his agenda
There was no word, and it's code for ""surrender""
So when the headlines had announced the arrest, the repercussion
Was his trial became a lightning rod for discussion
Compellin' evidence, statements from residents
Validated guilt as he maintained his innocence
From the hair to the fiber, broke the bondage wire
The stains on the carpet consisted with saliva
DNA directly linked to the psycho
Luminal made it glow, was test to Type 0
For many years, a lot of murders went unsolved
A lot of blood resolve as guns still revolve
The bullets had names that made the frames shatter
Most savage massacre that made the brains scatter
Detectives astounded by the scope of the crime
Made a hard discovery from one of many signs
While questionin' a man he picked up on a scanner
He reacted in a loud and agitated matter
And once they tried to read him his rights
He turned cold as ice",Luminal,2002

Then months later it was, then years later it was
Written on loose leaf, that old formula
That was stolen by a new thief

The journalist watched it, critics couldn't knock it
A piece of history that they carried in they pocket
With the time factor, speed was the order of the day
What a delay, they were able to, what he would say
Why waste the slot time of the ridiculous rhyme

And he was the Shogun's decapitator.

The Shogun just stayed inside his castle -- and he never came out.
People said his brain was infected by DEVILS.
My father would come home -- he would forget about the killings.

He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him.
Maybe that was the problem.

Energy is felt once the cards are dealt

With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga I think

I drop megaton BOMBS more faster than you blink
'Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance is if I'm blunted

Turn that shit up, my clan in da front want it

[Chorus]

I'm on a Mission, that niggaz say is Impossible
But when I swing my swords they all choppable
I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
Child educator, plus head amputator

Cause niggaz styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak, like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, hit the rail, like Amtrak

What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
Round the clock, that state pen time check it
With the pens I be stickin but you can't stick to crime

Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Into the chamber, and it's a whole different sound

It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggaz are fascinated how the shit begin
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin

The Genius,"Yo, I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz that front, they be pullin' stunts
I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts

I was always taught my do's and don'ts
For do's I did and for don'ts, I said, ""I won't""
I'm from Brooklyn, a place where stars are born

Streets are shot up, apartment buildings are torn and ripped up
Stripped up, shacked up and backed up from fiends
'Cause the bosses on the scene, they got it cracked up

Kids are slingin' in my lobby, little Steve and Bobby
Gettin' paid but it's a life-threatening hobby
Yeah, they still play hide and seek
The fiends seek for the crack and they hide and let the cops peep

Grown folks say, they should be out on their own
Before the gangs come and blow up their mom's home
Because they lifestyle is hectic so fuckin' hectic
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Bullets are ejected

My lifestyle was so far from well
Coulda wrote a book with a title
'Age 12 And Goin' through Hell'

Then I realized the plan
I'm trapped in a deadly video game with just one man
So I don't only watch my back, I watch my front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts

Back on the Ave of Lavonia and Bristol with a pistol
Stickin' up Pamela and Crystal
You know your town is dangerous when you see the strangest
Kid, come home from doin' the bid and nuthin' changes

What is the meaning of crime
Is it criminals robbin' innocent motherfuckers every time?
Little shorties take walks to the schoolyard
Tryin' to solve the puzzles to why is life so hard

Then as soon as they reached the playground, blaow!
Shots ring off and now one of them lay down
It's so hard to escape the gunfire
I wish I could rule it out like the umpire

But it's an everlasting game
And it never cease to exist
Only the players change

So I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts
I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts

I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts
I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts

I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts
I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts

I gotcha back, I gotcha back
I gotcha back, I gotcha back
I gotcha back, I gotcha back
I gotcha back, I gotcha back

I gotcha back so you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front that be pullin' stunts
I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
It's the niggaz who front that be pullin' stunts

{Your technique is magnificent when cut across the neck
A sound like wailing winter winds is heard, they say
I'd always hoped to cut someone like that someday
To hear that sound but to have it happen
To my own neck is ridiculous}

The Genius,"[GZA]
The echo chamber enhance the flow wit the block party
Keep an MC head spinning like Dark Bacardi
This B.A.C. is 2.3
Now the liver's damaged, but his lungs are joint free
So inhale, exhale, breathe and get well
Kick something live stop chirping like Nextel
I'm All In Together, a swordsman forever
I paint the town red, with many heads are severed
Are-A-W, I still bring trouble to
Throw your raps in the sleephold, quick to snuggle you
Dart heat your breastplate, meet ya death date
Rook down a E4, look, it's checkmate
No other way to describe a catastrophe
The plan was drawing blood and displayed it graphically
Direct order, hit the border, then slaughter
Horrific torture, by prolific authors
Shape and mold MC's, like I'm playing the skelly top
It's getting 'hot in here' like the single that Nelly dropped
So take ya clothes off, the track is so soft
A little rock'll turn 'em into Ivan Koloff
Why do the Gods make MC's study from
Thirty five, and fifty year, then try to become
Under the study with the sword above the head
So he would keep in mind under the open pledge

[Masta Killa]
Fierce glisten, something so sharp
Piercing, swords cling, the vigilante intimate
Close combat, this is MC'ing at it's best
But there is no contest, sent I'm this
Speaking of a test, this and try to question this
He so different with the swiftness, godfather civilization
Shell casing, universal nation
Could he be the one predicted, presidential sent in
Old school soul to war us, be the growlest
Asiatic arctic flow is so frigid

[RZA]
Is it, the Zig Zag, I'mma pay you a visit
Somehow mistake me as an old wise wizard
World, I'm not the same
I go somewhere, don't remember how I came
Is it the weed, the hash or the 'caine?
Or the Digi being stained on my brain
Appear from a cloud of smoke, the voter's on choke
If surrounded, seven men drop from one stroke
Even if my feet was shackled down to one handcuff
To defeat me, ten demons wouldn't be enough
I sleep in the lion's den, without the steel iron
Ascended like Wu, so coming down from Mt. Zion
Superlogical this, superlogical that
Digital, take it back with superlogical rap
Have a shootout, at midnight, the sequel's quicker
Forty four colt jolt, all you seen was the flicker
You distressed like the damsal, lost like little Hansel
Your flame couldn't generate the heat of a candle
Me, I be a Killa Bee, keeping exilery
Gold-plated desert e, shoot ten millime'
Master the millipede, you try to end the sea
Your body being found in the neighbor yard artillery
A black blind governor, a rich white mayor
Man, this whole city ain't got a prayer
Bobby has invaded, now the whole town's slated
Your decapitated head is being took and operated
Up and down the avenue, I drive a shatterproof
Benz, and all my men's are tattle proof
My mic is a dyke, my life is a light
A Day to God is a Thousand Years, how long is a night?
You get trapped in my shadow of dark, ark, who goes there?
Power-you smells like carp, don't put your nose there
Drop you to a tank of sharks, your wound's bleeding
And it's been two weeks since they had their last feeding
Ain't nothing but bones, we plotted the sand
And spread it out, over 20 acres of land
Some call me Steels, 'cause it's hard to bend me
See-Cypher Pigs, can't apprehend me
In a no smoking zone, I smoke bones of hash
Niggas see me, then I disappear in the flash
Next time I'm spotted, I got the fatter wallet
Moving with a click that stick like dry porridge
Someone's been sitting in my chair, who goes there?
To sub zero cold, your words can't flow here
Glaciers of ice, plus layers of spice
Say your prayers at night, 'fore you touch that mic

Is keeping perfectly still

Sees the sun going down

See the world spinning round
