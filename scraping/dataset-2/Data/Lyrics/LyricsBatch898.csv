Barbara Mandrell,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

He talked to me
To tell me he's been thinking of me
And all this time he's changed his mind
Oh, he told me so
That's how I know he's gonna love me

Tonight's the night
We'll turn out the light
And love again
Like we did back then
And we'll start all over
Tonight

Tonight's my lucky night I'm sure
He's at my door
I've waited for this chance to hold him
And how I see he's needed me
Oh, imagine that
He's coming back
Coming back to live forever

And love again

And we'll start all over

You don't know who this is but...

I was going through my man's pockets this morning...
And I just happened to find your name and number...
So woman to woman, I don't think it's wrong to call
Now, I don't know how you're gonna take this...
You might even hang up the phone...
But, you see, it really doesn't make any difference...
And it's only fair that I let you know...
That ""that man"" you've been seeing...
He's mine...and I love him...

When your whole world came tumblin' to the ground

And I said hallelujah that woman socked it to ya
Just walked away and blew your mind

Barbara Mandrell,"Aren't we the same two people
Who took those vows that mean nothing now
Didn't we sit at this table as husband and wife
Now we're on opposite sides
Is this the way love ends
With paper and pen

[Chorus]
It's all there in black and white
All the words that separate our lives
It's all there, wrong or right
But love falls between the lines
It's something you can't write
In black and white

Can we forget all the good times
And never look back, it is as easy as that
Can we be sure that it's finished
With tears in our eyes, can we say that we tried
It's all come down to this
Is there something that we missed

But opening and closing doors swing both ways
Is it too late

Barbara Mandrell,"I don't want to tie you down
With some lines spoken in sorrow
With some hopes pinned on tomorrow
You've got your bedroll and your guitar
And there you are
Ready to be alone, rolling stone

I don't want the phone to ring
I can't talk when I'm crying
Your voice shakes when you're lying
Saddle the wind and ride for the sun
The way you run
You'll never have a home, rolling stone

But if you don't love what you've found
Just remember the world is round
And whatever rolls away
Can always roll back home some day

When you sleep beneath the sky
With your coat making your pillow
As the wind cries on the willows
And your bed holds no tenderness
Remember this
You made it on your own, rolling stone, roll on",Rolling Stone,1982
Barbara Mandrell,"They say that times are getting harder
Well that's easy to say
And this crazy world can't go much farther
It's spinning faster each day
But not everything has changed

[Chorus]
Kids still get restless on rainy days
Lilacs still fill the air in spring
Love's still the only word that I can use in telling you
The way I feel and I'll love you always
Some things never change

Seems like we're always in a hurry getting no where fast
We're all wrapped up in work and worry but all of that will pass
It's the simple things that last

[Chorus]

After all that we've been through
Love is still the same",Some Things Never Change,1982
Barbara Mandrell,"She was my friend when I needed a friend
He was a man who said our love would never end
When things went wrong she'd tell us both to try again
That's what friends are for that's what friends are for

And there were times when she was feeling down
One of us would always come around
And try to share some other happiness we found
That's what friends are for that's what friends are for

I suppose I should have seen what was happening to me
And I guess I should have known there wasn't love enough for three
And now there's only me

So I'm alone like I never thought I'd be
I trusted her just as far as I could see
And she stole his love away from me
If that's what friends are for
I don't need them anymore

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams

Barbara Mandrell,"Once again the windows shine with pretty lights
Once again our loved ones gather at our side
Busy crowds of strangers greet each other with a smile
There's Christmas in the eyes of every child

Once again the presents are resting by the tree
Once again we worship the One who came for you and me
I hear choirs of voices as they're singing out His name
Again we tell the story of how the Christ Child came

One night a year we believe in peace on earth
One night a year we praise our Savior's birth
I wish every night the whole year through could be
Like Christmas Eve
When love's pure light is shining everywhere, one night a year

Once again around the world heads are bowed in prayer
Once again the promise of peace is in the air
But soon will come the morning and the feeling will be past
And I can't help but wonder why the feeling only lasts

One night a year we believe in peace on earth
One night a year we praise our Savior's birth
I wish every night the whole year through could be
Like Christmas Eve
When love's pure light is shining everywhere, one night a year

Is gonna be the devil in some else's arms tonight

You've been with somebody else you were only kidding yourself

(Hugh Prestwood)

You took your suitcase and your toothbrush
And walked out in your walking shoes
You left behind this little letter breaking me the news
But now some things of mine are missing
Some things that I could dearly use
And since the evidence points to you
I must accuse

I don't mean to be unfriendly
All I want is to be fair
I'll be more than glad to share
But you gotta tell me where
Are the pieces of my heart

It was bad enough to break it
After all that we've been through
But then to go on and take it
Was unkind of you
Every night I feel so empty
This pain is more than I can bear
Even if you do not care
You just gotta tell me where
Are the pieces of my heart

It's not the first time it's been broken
It's been dropped a time or two
I got to piece it together
And then get over you
Where even if you do not care
You just gotta tell me where
Are the pieces of my heart

Where even if you do not care
You just gotta tell me where
Are the pieces of my heart

He rides off in a cloud of dust
Lookin' for a border he can cross
She'll stand by and watch him go
Wonderin' if he'll ever know
The hurt she's feelin' now
And what they've lost

They give their whole hearts when they fall
Angels love bad men that's how it's always been
Love holds their hearts against the wall

He rides away in his Mercedes Benz
Soon he's lost beneath the neon sky
Outside of town, in their suburban home
She spends another night alone
And wonders what went wrong wonders why

I can't get through

I only need a second or two,
That's all it takes to say I love you

I called the airlines, they checked his flight
He was on the 8.09
I called the hotel where he stays when he goes to L.A.
They said he checked in late last night, Room 245

I don't wanna be right

It's a downright disgrace
As long as I got you by my side
I don't care what our people say
My friend tell me there's no future in loving a married man
If I can't have you when I want you
I'm a see you when I can

Am I wrong to fall so deeply in love with you
Knowing you have a wife and two little children depending on you too
Am I wrong to hunger for the gentleness of your touch
Oh when I got someone else at home who needs me just as much

Someone I’ve needed so long
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me and somehow I know I’ll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Who have my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before

For once I have someone I know won't desert me
I’m not alone anymore

This is mine you can’t take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it

Restless wind inside a letter box

Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together

from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew,
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1994
Barbara Sutton-Curtis,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there

Barbara Thompson,"All is fair in love 
Love's a crazy game 
Two people vow to stay 
In love as one they say 

But all is changed with time 
The future no one can see 
The road you leave behind 
Ahead lies mystery 

But all is fair in love 
I had to go away 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 

All of fate's a chance 
It's either good or bad 
I tossed my coin to say 
In love with me you'd stay 

But all in war is so cold 
You either win or lose 
When all is put away 
The losing side I'll play 

But all is fair in love 
I should never have left your side

Give it to me

Get on the dance floor
Start to clap your hands for
The smooth operator, what more can your ask for
The musical maestro
That's usin the mic so
I can spark up the entire place like nitro
Glycerine because the crowd is sizzlin'
Bobbin they heads to what's said and still listenin'
I specialize in fun
And I must know what's happenin' cos you're dancin' like re-run
So behold the natural born soul, a rhythm
To get em and hit em as I party with em
My job is to make you all feel this
But I'm not don cornelius
I'm just a new black cesar here to please ya, ease ya
Movin' and groovin', provin', soothin' at your leisure
I don't sing or yell
But my rhymes reach out and touch more people than ma bell
The brain of the Kane's so intelligent
You think dancin' is irrelevant
And start stompin' like a elephant
But that's not necessary, just let the beat carry
You into somethin' funkadelic
That might best describe
The musical vibe you feel when I arrive
From the moment I walk through the door
I gotta keep em on the floor

Get up and dance and move your body across the floor
Go on and do your thing until you're feelin' sore
(I can't dance no more)
Get on up and dance
(let's dance)
Get on up and dance
(give it here)
Get on up and dance
(funky)

Look
You came in the disco
Thinkin' it would be just low
But I'ma make sure you enjoy this show
You won't have a chance to sit down
(get down)
And listen to rhymes that go the mile like a marathon
A voice that's choice, as strong as sarah vaugh
Swift delivery flowin' like a river be
Flowin', but only ladies know my tongue is that slippery
I grab the mic and then we'll see
Who can d-a-n-c-e
Makin' the crowd roar for more of what they saw
And I'm sure that I can keep em on the floor

Get up and dance and move your body across the floor
Go on and do your thing until you're feelin' sore
(I can't dance no more)
Get on up and dance
(let's dance)
Get on up and dance
(give it here)
Get on up and dance
(funky)

Oh
Feel like I'm down here by myself sometimes
I'm ready to break this groove down
You're ready

So I'ma let the music just stop
And we gon' get into our own thing for a minute here
You're ready

Break it down

Keep on dancin'
(Keep on dancin')

(Dance)

Bring in paramedics to relieve the
Trace of this bad case of dance fever
Cos I can feel the disco heat gettin' to me
While the sweat got my silk drawers stickin' to me
But I can't stop, I gotta party
Like a gun on the dance floor and catch a body
I might move real smooth
Then again dance real silly
Just like a hillbilly
As I make sure the beat is kept
So all the party people stay in step
Become a slave to the rhythm
Grab someone of the opposite sex and dance with em
Put your partner on the floor and face em
That shows a positive sign of unification
And if all party goers could make this move
We'd be one nation under a groove
So let's try this, stop the violence
That can only result in peace from what I sense
To be straight to the point
A little love and harmony mh (it's the joint)
So build a nation, pump the bass and
The treble beyond the level of imagination
So the big daddy Kane can endure
And the name of this tune is keep em on the floor

Because all of your hope is gone,
And your life is filled with much confusion 
Until happiness is just an illusion,
And your world around is crumblin' down;

Reach out (reach out for me.)

Reach out (reach out for me.)
I'll be there, to love and comfort you, 
And I'll be there, to cherish and care for you.
I'll be there to love and comfort you.
 
I can tell the way you hang your head,
You're without love and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around, 
But there's no peace of mind to be found.
I know what you're thinkin', 
You're alone now, no love of your own, 
But darling, reach out (come on girl, reach out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there, to give you all the love you need, 
And I'll be there, you can always depend on me.","Reach Out, I LL Be There",1995
Barbara Wilson,"I've been lookin' for a girl 
Someone to share my world 
For maybe just a day or two
You've been actin' so stingy
I know you want to' see
If I can do the things you heard

Actually I'd rather be out with my girls and weed
I guess that goes go to show you don't know me boy
If you really want to creep
Then talk to me with cheese

She's strange and I like it
Girl when your walk you don't know what you do to me
I got game 
So don't fight it 
All around the world she's just a sexy girl
Strange

You be actin' like you cool
Like you don't want to do
The things I know you want to do

Are you tryin' to come up
Or maybe just get fucked

Whatever girl I'm down like you

If you wasn't so damn cute 
I wouldn't even shoot

But yet you choose to shoot me down 
Actually it's time I leave 
You're girl is jockin' me 
I hope she's not another tease

Listen here I'd like to know
Why you keep actin' strange
I got no time to chase a hoe
But I'd like to know your name 
All I got is game to give
And it's gonna' be cryin' shame 
If you choose to disregard 
And pass up on this game

Barbara Wilson,"As I look up at the sky
My mind starts tripping
A tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they breaking trying to save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live?
(Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dream of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son)
My eyes are closed

Murder, murder was the case that they gave me

I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
(Just remember who changed your mind
Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe, check it out

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star

Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1965

Until I told the truth and prayed

Caminito que el tiempo ha borrado 
que juntos un día nos viste pasar, 
he venido por última vez, 
he venido a contarte mi mal. 
Caminito que entonces estabas 
bordeado de trébol why juncos en flor, 
una sombra ya pronto serás, 
una sombra lo mismo que yo.
 
Desde que se fue, 
triste vivo yo; 
caminito amigo, 
yo también me voy. 
Desde que se fue 
nunca más volvió. 
Seguiré sus pasos, 
caminito, adiós.
 
Caminito que todas las tardes 
feliz recorría cantando mi amor, 
no le digas si vuelve a pasar 
que mi llanto tu suelo regó. 
Caminito cubierto de cardos, 
la mano del tiempo tu huella borró; 
yo a tu lado quisiera caer
why que el tiempo nos mate a los dos.

Los amigos ya no vienen
Ni siquiera a visitarme,
Nadie quiere consolarme

Siento angustias en mi pecho,
Decí, percanta, 
Qué has hecho e mi pobre corazón?

Sin embargo,

Por la que quiso engañarte

Solo tienes que preocuparte como se porte a tu lado 

Trata de nunca fijarte en mujeres que no están solas 
Yo sé que eso tiene un gustito tentador, pero hay otras

Algunas buscan amar 
Otras buscan aventuras 
Y muchas miraran solamente tu postura 
Serás seguramente un buen amante

His pains are in pain

For just my prescriptions
My bills for only pills alone
Would chill you to the bone

And play a story that only
Turn yet it maybe could write

They might believe in what you say
So stop your song it's not polite
Pipe down before you start a fight

-you don't say, teacher, is that right?

So if you're wise, you'll just lay low
And play with the guys that have the dough

Turn back, don't be an old hep cat

The big bad wolf, the big bad wolf
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
Tra la la la la

Long ago there were three pigs
Little handsome piggy wigs
For the big, bad the very big, very bad wolf
They did not give three figs

Number one was very gay
And he built his house with hay
With a hey hey toot he blew on his flute
And he played around all day

Now number two was fond of jigs
And so he built his house with twigs
Hey, diddle diddle he played on his fiddle
And danced with lady pigs

Number three said, ""Nix on tricks
I shall build my house with bricks""
He had no chance to sing or dance
'Cause work and play don't mix

Ha, ha, ha, the two little do little pigs
Just winked and laughed ah, woo

Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
The big bad wolf, the big bad wolf
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
Tra la la la la

Came the day when fate did frown
And a wolf blew into town
With a gruff huff puff, he puffed just enough
And the hay house fell right down

One and two were scared to death
Of the big bad wolf's breath
By the hair of your chinny chin I'll blow you in
And the twig house answered yes

No one left but number three
To save that piglet family
So when they knocked, he fast unlocked
And said come in with me

Now they all were safe inside
But the bricks hurt wolf's pride
So, he slid down the chimney and oh, by Jiminey
In a fire he was fried

Oh, oh, oh, the three little free little pigs
Just winked and laughed, ah, woo

This is where our story ends
Never lovers, ever friends

Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day
But before you walk away
I sincerely want to say

I wish you bluebirds in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss, but more than this, i wish you love!
And in July a lemonade
To cool you in some leafy glade
I wish you health, and more than wealth, i wish you love!

My breaking heart and i agree
That you and i could never ever be
So with my best, my very best, i set you free!

Learn that love will soothe and love will burn

Sweet and bitter ride
That one and nothing can change it
Love and learn like me that love is strange
It will warm you in winter and chill in spring
Invade your nights then one day be gone

Love and learn that love's mad, gay and sad, good and bad
Nothing like you've had but you can't
Heaven it seems
You give your love to your man
All the love that you can

Barbra Streisand,"If a girl isn't pretty
Like a Miss Atlantic City
All she gets in life is pity
And a pat

Kindly name a star who hasn't
Won a contest or a pageant
If she hasn't she just never
Gets to bat

She must shine in every detail
Like a ring, you're buying retail
Be a standard size that
Fits a standard dress

When a girl's incidentals
Are no bigger than two lentils
Then to me it doesn't spell
Success

Frumpy faces that could cause ya
To have temporary nausea
Do I have to hear a lecture
Such as that?

Is a nose with deviation
Such a crime against the nation?
Should I throw her into jail
Or drown the cat?

So she looks a bit off balance
She possesses golden talents
Or is that a pill too bitter
To digest?

Oh, she's got very nice deportment, hmm
But when they see that at Ortmund's
From the gallery they'll be
Throwing fruit

Barbra Streisand,"Act II opens with the newly wed Fanny and Nick
Arriving at their home in Long Island. Fanny's
Friends have prepared a surprise party for them.
Ziegfeld is there, hoping Fanny will be in his new
Show; he's even hired her friend Eddie as dance
Director. Fanny's Ziegfeld friends ask her what
It's like be married and she replies:
[Fanny:]
I'm Sadie, Sadie, married lady,
Bow when I go by.
I'm a corporation now,
Not me, myself and I.
Oh how that marriage license works
On chambermaids and hotel clerks.
The honeymoon was such delight
That we got married that same night.
I'm Sadie, Sadie, married lady,
Still in bed at noon,
Racking my brain deciding
Between orange juice and prune.
Nick says nothing is too good for me,
And who am I not to agree?
I'm Sadie, Sadie, married lady, that's me!
[All:]
She's Sadie, Sadie, married lady,
[Fanny:]
Meet a mortgagee,
[All:]
The owner of an icebox
[Fanny:]
With a ten-year guarantee.
Oh, sit me in the softest seat,
Quick, a cushion for my feet.
Do for me, buy for me, lift me, carry me,
Finally got a guy to marry me!
I do my nails,
Read up on sales,
All day the records play.
Then he comes home, I tell him
Oy--what a day I had today!
I swear I'll do my wifely job,
Just sit at home--become a slob!
I'm Sadie, Sadie, married lady, that's me!
[All:]
She's Sadie, Sadie, married lady,
[Boys:]
Sadie, you did the trick.
[Fanny:]
It's nothing!
[Girls:]
Not ev'ry girl can get herself
A guy who looks like Nick.
[Fanny:]
Wait, to tell the truth, it hurt my pride--
The groom was prettier than the bride.

Let your skin be red or green or blue

I can't really lose when you're near, when you're near

And love, if all my friends have forgotten half their promises
They're not unkind, just hard to find
One look at you and I know that I could learn to live
Without the rest, I found the best

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
No, I won't last a day without you
Can't last a day without you

Love in the afternoon

He walked right up and told me
That he liked my style
I noticed something different
In the way he smiled

He said, ""You're quite a lady
And I know a place that's shady
Would you care to come
And lie with me awhile?""

And deep in my soul
I could feel a quiver
When he went down
And found that sweet old river

And he showed me the way
To find love in the afternoon

I knew he was a stranger
But I didn't care
We had something in common
But it wasn't clear

He said that life's a lover
When you love and like no other
Don't you think it's time
For you to get your share?

And deep in my soul
I could feel a quiver
When he went down
And found that sweet old river

And he showed me the way
To find love in the afternoon

I never could remember
Or recall his name
But I hang on to that memory
Just the same

I know it makes me crazy
It makes my head all hazy
To think about the way
He played that game

'Cause deep in my soul
I could feel a quiver
When he went down
And found that sweet old river

And he showed me the way
To find love in the afternoon

Yes, deep in my soul
I could feel a quiver

Showed me and showed me

Barbra Streisand,"?Whatever you are, you're going to be
Whatever you are is all right with me
You're going to be what you want anyway?
These are the words I heard my father say

When I was a young girl and shy of men
He said, ?When you're ready, you'll know just when?
And when I was taken and thrown away
There wasn't a reason to face the day

And he said, ?Whatever you are, you're going to be
Whatever you are is all right with me
You're going to be what you want anyway?
These are the words I heard my father say

My father's soul is clear and easy
And though he's gone, he lives in my heart
When I go wrong I swear he sees me
And he smiles for a start and he says

?Wherever you are, I'm here by your side
My life is a rope that won't come untied
Oh, I'm going to stand by you, right or wrong?

There are themes that fill the screen
There are lines I say that sound as if they're written

And I must stagger out into the blinding sunlight half alive
Wishing I were back inside the picture show

There where it's always night

The second role I've said around too tight
Will I stay? Yes, I might

Oh widescreen wider on my eyes
Lie my mind with lies
Find the world like nothing that I've seen
Oh widescreen dreams are just my sighs

As we walk from out the movie
Are we acting out a scene
Does the orchestra play chords
When we start loving?

Do we move just like slow motion
On the screen?
Life's a constant disappointment
When you live on celluloid

But my movie expectations are a dream I can't avoid
Waiting for a man to say the things
That I heard in the film last night
But he doesn't want to play the role

And he can't pick his cues up right
Will I dream? Yes, I might!

Blinding me with lies

It's the fly she seeks
You may be her lover but you never will recover
'Cause she ain't had a bite for weeks
You think your the same, 'cause you got the same name
But the widow has a mobile home
Remember what I told you, she got eight arms to hold you
And she's never gonna let your roam
She'll tuck in your head, then she'll wrap you as a midnight snack
So if you see a spider, don't you slide up beside her
Why'd you think the widow's wearin' black?
Queen bee, baby
Pray that you may be left on your own, uh huh
Nothin' she'll give you, gonna outlive you
But the queen bee's never gonna be alone
Long before Atlantis there has been a praying mantis
And you knows why he's on his knees
He may have religion but but he's just a sittin' pigeon
If a woman even stars to tease
He won't even quibble if she has a little nibble on his neck, what a way to go
And now you done and torn it!
You been messin' with a hornet
She's a blue-blood wasp, you know
And just as you do it
She'll inject yiu with a fluid that you ain't even got but none
You're the meat on the plate, not even first rate
She's gonna feed you to her seventh son

Of the women who have ruled alone
Little Nefertiti used to consummate a treaty
In the bad as much as on the throne

Just to try a man but she'd refuse.
Queen Isabella was the one who said
This fella named Columbus ought to take a cruise
Didn't Cleopatra try to gratify and satisfy
The men she held within the grasp?
The pyramids where shakin' from the peace that she was makin'
But she ended with a stupid asp
The queen bee, no way, and even tho' they think they're the kings
(escatological things)
Who are they foolin'? Playin' at rulin'
It's the queen behind the scene who pulls the strings
So, in conclusion, it's an optical illusion
If you think that we're the weaker race
Men got the muscle, but the ladies got the hustle
And the truth is staring in your face
The mother bear stalks, and the queen of the hawks
Is the one who brings home the bread.
The lion that is regal, and the bald headed eagle
Need a woman just to keep them fed
But come the evenin', we're like adam and his eve,
Inside the garden. hear the serpent's song?
It's so frustratin', when you're really into martin'
And there ain't a lovin' man around

Throw out the glory
Bring in the men (give me them an I'll swing)
Write me a sequel

No promises to keep
I've got things so together
That I just can't fall asleep
Walked the night and drank the moon
Got home at half-past four,
And I knew that no-one marked my time
As I unlocked my door.
It's really lovely to discover
That you like to be alone
Not to owe your man an answer
When he gets you on the phone
Not to share a pair of porkchops
When you crave champagne and cheese
And your aim becomes to please yourself
And not to aim to please
Oh they sold me when they told me
Two can live as cheap as one
But I'm learning twice you're earning
Doesn't mean it's twice the fun
If you spend your each dime and all your time
On someone else's schemes
I'm not needy but I'm greedy
And I live my deepest dreams
Take an hour in the shower
Use the water while it's hot
In the tub a hand to scrub my back
Is all I haven't got.

Self-aware with self-esteem
Is selfishness a crime?
I take the day for quite a ride
And I take my own sweet time
Time to spare and time to share
And grateful I would be
If just one damn man would share the need
To be alone with me.

Thinking something might be saved.
Growing tired of broken promises
And dreams you never made.

Not knowing I would hurt, so, in the end.
So I swore I'd never call you home again.

Took time to see through all the glitter
That you made.
I was blinded by your fire light
And swept myself away.

And I guess I couldn't bring myself to see
You had taken all the very best of me.
So I'm leaving while there's something left of me.
Just like a child, I keep running back for more.

'Cause I've been hurt before,
And one more time around won't break me.
You will never see that side of me,

I told my service to pick up all my calls,
And I've taken down our photographs
That lined our bedroom walls.
And the outside door no longer has your name.
All your clothes are gone.

My welcome mat's been changed,
But the key's still there,
And I've left the door unchained.

Remembering what happened a moment ago
Like after the rain, when the wind breezes a sigh
While it's resting on pillows of sky
Deep in your arms, it's peaceful and warm
Together we lay in a calm that comes after a storm
In a moment or two, we can hear the stars coming through
I love the quiet right after the rain here with you

After the rain, the birds want to fly
The trees all in green hang the leaves out to dry
Like puddles and pools, what your eyes let me see
Are their loving reflections of me
After a while, you touch me and then
I feel like a flower that longs for a shower again

And then lost in a kiss,
I could stay for hours like this
Though i don't know just what magic the raindrops contain
I know that everything's wonderful after the rain",After the Rain,1979

Kiss me in the rain, and make me feel like a child again

I can smile happy your days (I can dream of the old days)

A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters

I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

The still cold smell of morning
A street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Of my days in the sun

More to question, yet more to believe

I could leave without a trace.
Go anywhere, or any place

In a world that has no time
In a world that pays no mind

Spent my life

Someone willing to care

You have to pay a price, girl!
They like to give advice, girl!
Don't think about it twice, girl!
It's time to get to work!
Art isn't easy
Even when you're hot
Advancing art is easy
Financing it is not
A vision's just a vision if it's only in your head
If no one gets to hear it, it's as good as dead
It has to come to life
Bit by bit, putting it together
Piece by piece, only way to make a work of art
Every moment makes a contribution
Every little detail plays a part
Having just a vision's no solution
Everything depends on execution
Putting it together, that's what counts

Ounce by ounce, putting in together
Small amounts, adding up to make a work of art
First of all you need a good foundation
Otherwise it's risky from the start
Takes a little cocktail conversation
But without the proper preparation
Having just a vision's no solution
Everything depends on execution
The art of making art
Is putting it together, bit by bit
Link by link, making the connections, yes we do!
Drink by drink, taking every comment as it comes
Learning how to play the politician
Like you play piano, bass and drums
Otherwise you'll find your composition
Isn't gonna get much exhibition
Art isn't easy
Every minor detail is a major decision
Have to keep things in scale
Have to hold to your vision
What's a little cocktail conversation
If it gets the funds for your foundation
Every time I start to feel defensive
I remember vinyl is expensive!
Maybe one!
Dot by dot, building up the image
Shot by shot, keeping at a distance doesn't pay
Still if you remember your objective
Not give all your privacy away
A little bit of hype can be effective
As long as you can keep it in perspective
Even when you get some recognition
Everything you do you still audition

Art isn't easy
Overnight you're a trend
You're the right combination
Then the trend's at an end
You're suddenly last year's sensation
All they ever want is repetition
All they really like is what they know
Gotta keep a link with your tradition
Gotta learn to trust your intuition
While you re-establish your position
So that you can be on exhibit
So that your work can be on exhibition!
Be new, girl!
They tell you till they're blue, girl!
You're new, or else you're through, girl!
And even if it's true, girl
You do what you can do!
Bit by bit, putting it together
Piece by piece, working on the vision night and day
All it takes is time and perseverance
With a little luck along the way
Putting in a personal appearance
Gathering supporters and adherents
Mapping out the songs but in addition
Harmonizing each negotiation
Balancing the part that's all musicians
With the part that's strictly presentation
Balancing the money with the mission
Till you have the perfect orchestration
Even if you do have the suspicion
That it's taking all your concentration
The art of making art
Is putting it together, bit by bit
Beat by beat, part by part
Sheet by sheet, chart by chart track by track
By by reel
By stack, snit by snit
By meal, shout by shout
By deal, spat by spat
Shpiel by shpiel

And something great is coming

Barbra Streisand,"[Barbra:] Look, I've spent a lot of time working on this
[Producer 1:] Look, no one's gonna buy it -- no one.
[Producer 2:] No one in Middle America, anyway. That's for sure.
[Producer 3:] He's right!
[Producer 1:] Sweetheart, it's just not commercial!
[Barbra:] What is commercial?
[Producer 2:] It's not what's selling nowadays.
[Producer 1:] I mean - personally, I love it, but
[Barbra (sung):]Be nice, girl!
[Producer 3:] Nobody's into this kind of material.
[Barbra (sung):] You have to pay a price, girl!
[Producer 2:] This album needs a hit single we can push.
[Barbra (sung):]They like to give advice, girl!
[Producer 1:] The whole idea's too risky.
[Barbra (sung):] Don't think about it twice, girl!
[Producer 2:] The audience won't understand this kind of thing!
[Barbra (sung):]It's time to get to work!
Barbra (spoken): I disagree! Why don't you wait until you hear it?
[Producer 3:] This is like your old stuff!
[Barbra (sung):] Art isn't easy.
[Producer 3:] You've got to appeal to the kids.
[Barbra (sung):] Even when you're hot.
[Producer 2:] Why would you want to make an album like this anyway?
[Barbra (sung):] Advancing art is easy.
[Producer 1:] I think we ought to talk seriously about this.
[Barbra (sung):] Financing it is not!
[Producer 2:] Why take chances?
[Barbra (sung):] A vision's just a vision if it's only in your head!
[Producer 1:] Nobody respects your artistic integrity more than I do, but
[Barbra (sung):] If no one gets to hear it, it's as good as dead!
[Producer 2:] You have to think about you career!
[Barbra (sung):] It has to come to life!
Bit by bit, putting it together
Piece by piece, only way to make a work of art
Every moment makes a contribution
Every little detail plays a parts
Having just a vision's no solution
Everything depends on execution
Putting it together, that's what counts!
Ounce by ounce, putting in together
Small amounts, adding up to make a work of art
First of all you need a good foundation
Otherwise it's risky from the start
Takes a little cocktail conversation
But without the proper preparation
Having just a vision's no solution
Everything depends on execution
The art of making art
Is putting it together, bit by bit
[Producer 2:] Do we really need all these musicians?
[Barbra:] Link by link, making the connections, yes we do!
Drink by drink, taking every comment as it comes
Learning how to play the politician
Like you play piano, bass and drums
Otherwise you'll find your composition
Isn't gonna get much exhibition
Art isn't easy
Every minor detail is a major decision
Have to keep things in scale
Have to hold to your vision
[Producer 1:] Why don't we talk about this over dinner, darling?
What's a little cocktail conversation
If it gets the funds for your foundation
Every time I start to feel defensive
I remember vinyl is expensive!
[Producer 3:] Would you agree to do an interview?
[Barbra:] Maybe one!
Dot by dot, building up the image
Shot by shot, keeping at a distance doesn't pay
Still if you remember your objective
Not give all your privacy away
A little bit of hype can be effective
As long as you can keep it in perspective
Even when you get some recognition
Everything you do you still audition
Art isn't easy
Overnight you're a trend
You're the right combination
Then the trend's at an end
You're suddenly last year's sensation!
All they ever want is repetition
All they really like is what they know
Gotta keep a link with your tradition
Gotta learn to trust your intuition
While you re-establish your position
So that you can be on exhibit...
So that your work can be on exhibition!
Be new, girl!
They tell you till they're blue, girl!
You're new, or else you're through, girl!
And even if it's true, girl,
You do what you can do!
Bit by bit, Putting it together
Piece by piece, working on the vision night and day
All it takes is time and perseverance
With a little luck along the way
Putting in a personal appearance
Gathering supporters and adherents...
[Producer 1:] Well, she's an original!
[Producer 3:] WAS!
[Barbra:] Mapping out the songs but in addition
Harmonizing each negotiation
Balancing the part that's all musicians
With the part that's strictly presentation
Balancing the money with the mission
Till you have the perfect orchestration
Even if you do have the suspicion
That it's taking all your concentration
The art of making art
Is putting it together, bit by bit
Beat by beat, part by part
Sheet by sheet, chart by chart
Track by track, bit by bit,
Reel by reel, pout by pout
Stack by stack, snit by snit,
meal by meal, shout by shout
Deal by deal, spat by spat
Shpiel by shpiel, doubt by doubt
And that... Is the state of the art!
",If I Loved You,1986
Barbra Streisand,"Love soft as an easy chair
Love fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you

Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
Seldom seen by two

You and I will make each night a first
Every day a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
They warm and excite us, cause we have the brightest love

Two lives that shine as one
Morning glory and midnight sun
Time we've learned to sail above
Time won't change the meaning of one love
Ageless and ever evergreen","A Evergreen (Love Theme From ""A Star Is Born"") [Live]",1987
Barbra Streisand,"Oh! What a beautiful night, isn't it? The smell, crickets, it worries me
That we are tampering with what it took
Three hundred eighty million years to create
We're being reckless with the whole miraculous balance of nature
But I have great faith in people
I believe that, if they're told, if they understand what's at stake
They will make a change, they always have
And so this is for you
You who have the opportunity to raise your voices and do it again

It's a new world I see
A new world for me
The tears have rolled off my cheek
And fears fade away everytime you speak
A new world away, we're in a tiny room
What a vision of joy and blossom and bloom
A new found promise one that will last
So I'm holdin' on and I'm holdin' fast
You'll bring a new world to me the way the world should be",It's a New World [Live],1987
Barbra Streisand,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Barbra Streisand,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember

 O beautiful for heroes proved,
 In liberating strife,
 Who more than self, their country loved
 And more than life

 Confirm thy soul in self-control,
 Thy liberty in law!

If we learn to tell the truth

And to trust each other
And be unafraid of what we'll see
With time and love we learn
When we accept each other

That's when our lives can come together
Let him stay by my side
If it lasts this time
Then the shadows of the past

Will remain behind us
And finally we will be free

We have this chance to grow

We have this chance to know each other

And then our lives will come together

Barbra Streisand,"So often as I wait for sleep
I find myself reciting
The words I've or should have said
Like scenes that need rewriting

The smiles I never answered
Doors perhaps I should have opened
Songs forgotten in the morning
I relive the roles I've played

The tears I may have squandered
The many pipers I have paid
Along the roads I've wandered
Yet all the time I knew it

Love was somewhere out there waiting
Though I may regret a kiss or two
If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray

I may have never found my way to you

And even when I had said next time
I'll never give my heart

Till I loved you
Every sky ever gray, never blue

Could the one to save me
Possibly be you?
I was lost, I was blind
Till I loved you
Wouldn't see, couldn't find someone new
You were my friend, dear friend
I held you close to my heart
But I never thought that I'd feel the way I do
Until that certain moment when I loved you
And now I can't ever imagine
My living without you
It seems I spend all of my time
Thinking only about you
Once I dreamed in a dream I would find you
Never thought that the dream would come true
Until that curtain lifted, parted, drifted from you
Until that certain moment when I loved you

Barbra Streisand,"Midnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can dream of the old days
Life was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Every street lamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp sputters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life 
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory, too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale court smell of morning
A street lamp dies
Another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you'll touch me
You'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun",Memory,1989

And if I'm ever the least unsure

Though you're someone in this world 
That I'll always choose to love
From now on 
You're only someone that I used to love

As for me it's getting down to the last unspoken part
When you must begin to ease the pain of a broken heart
Tell me why should I even care
If I have to lose your love
From now on
You're only someone that I used to love

Yet it wasn't enough for you
All the love I had to give
I did my best to keep you satisfied
I guess you'll never know how much I tried

And if ever our paths should cross again
Well, You won't find me being the one

What's the secret they reveal?

But I like the way I feel.

Barbra Streisand,"Here we are
Just going through the motions one more time
You looked in my eyes but you don't see me
Here I am, feeling like a stranger in your arms
I touch you, I hold you, but lately I don't know you
Something is wrong but we go on from day-to-day
And we just pretend it all away
We act like nothing's changed
But in our hearts we know it's not the same

Cause we're not makin' love anymore
Baby we're not makin' love like before
We may hold each other tight
Say that everything's all right
But we're not makin' love

Remember when you couldn't wait to run into my arms
When the love inside my heart was all you needed
Remember when you made me wish the night would never end
The fire, the thunder, we lived to love each other
If ever two hearts were one, then it was yours and mine
But that was another place in time
Now all we have to show
Are memories of a dream we used to know

Cause we're not makin' love anymore
Baby we're not makin' love like before
We may hold each other tight
Say that everything's all right
But we're not makin' love

When did we lose our way, we had it all
Don't know how it all just slipped away
But oh, can we get it back again
Is it too late, can we try
Just one time, because darling

My love life is boring me to tears,
After all these years

But he turned out to be like every other man
Our love, our love
Raining (raining)
Pouring (pouring)

Don't put up with his stuff,
Don't you do it
If you've had your fill,
Get the check pay the bill,
You can do it
Tell him to just get out
Nothing left to talk about
Pack his raincoat show him out
Just look him in the eyes and simple shout
Enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on, no more no
Enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now
I've always dreamed to find the perfect lover,
But he turns out to be like every other man

I'm lookin' for a reason to stay.
I'm all wound up and tied in knots today.
I'm lookin' for a reason not to go.
When the morning comes, I'll be on my way.

It seemed like a good idea way back then.

Dreams that should have lasted

Told each other secrets

Make me think you're near me

Boats that never sailed

We're more for having loved one another
We shared the sky

When time has put some distance between us

But it took time to understand the man 
Now at least I know I know him well. 
Wasn't it good? Oh so good 
Wasn't he fine? Oh so fine 
Isn't it madness he can't be mine? 
But in the end he needs
A little bit more than me

He needs his fantasy and freedom

No one in your life is with you constantly 
No one is completely on your side 
And though I move my world to be with him 
Still the gap between us is too wide.

Could have played things some other way.

I was just a little careless
But I was ever so much younger then.

Let me relax my dome
My whole joints blown another soldier won't be coming home
Parkside is gonna miss you black foreva
Ties will never sever
You died tryin to live better
Did what you had to do and now you deceased
I hope you livin in peace don't even stress that beef
Go head and sleep count your blessings return to the essence
Everytime I see your fam word is bon I feel your presence
Its all over bearing witness like jehovah
ain't nothing strange unless you watch your range like a rover
Follow me son, what's done is done, forgot it
God bless his soul while his bodys underground rotting
We won't forget you let a brother try to dis you
I swear to god he better have a blade and plus a pistol
Forever miss you got babies that want to kiss you
Shining like crystal, and at your wake I pass your ma a tissue
Chorus 2X
He was only thirteen when he burst his splean
The shot was fatal
He died right there upon the kitchen table BLAOW
It happened all alone in his house
Not a creature was stirrin, not a roach or a mouse
And I was just with him, playin Sega
And buggin on the horn with some honeys like a couple of playas
And now he's gone
I'm speakin on my man K-Shawn
Forever on my mind mentally as I kick my song
 
He used to talk about the box in the closet
Where his pops kept a glock and all the safety deposits
Now he stressed, fiendin just to hold some heat
I guess it came from all the stories that he heard in the street
I can't explain it, its ill how we used to feel
I used to tell him stop playin wit that chrome-piece steel
He never listened, and now my man is missin in action
I blame it on the fools in the street that's always blastin
[Chorus 2X]
Aiyyo my dreams are filled with terror
Shots gettin nearer
Paralyzed and right in front of my eyes its gettin clearer
A tragedy resulted from a brothers bad scratch
Tried to rob a deli but the gat he had was raggy
Bullets sprayed, ricocheted and automatically
Hit a bystander, young girl named Amanda
The slugs in her back by this cat buggin no crap
Another rugrat, somebody tell me where the loves at
Was only seven already on her way to heaven
She reached her day and now she won't see her wedding
Some might say that this was destined or something
But her parents only had one child and now they left with nothing
Book all that flix and when they daughter was six
Before they moved from the bricks and got caught up in the mix
They thought things would get better now they stressed forever
They last vision was image of a blood-soaked sweater
[Chorus 4X]",Move On,1993
Barbra Streisand,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,1993
Barbra Streisand,"Speak low when you speak love
Our summer day withers away too soon, too soon
Speak low when you speak love
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift, we're swept apart, too soon
Speak low, darling, speak low
Love is a spark, lost in the dark too soon, too soon.

I feel wherever i go
That tomorrow is near,
Tomorrow is here and always too soon,
Time is so old and love so brief
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

We're late, darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, everything ends too soon, too soon.

I wait, darling, i wait,
Will you speak low to me, speak love to me and soon...

I'm still here!
Gold statue sometimes,
Sometimes a kick-in-the-rear, but I'm here
Now one day you're hailed for blazing trails
Next you're nailed for fingernails
Either they cheer or they jeer, but I'm here
I've heard them say song writing, acting, producing,
What makes her think that she can? Or better yet song writing, acting, producing
What does she think, she's a man?
One day a Tony, Tuesday you're top of the Bill
So I'm here!
Wednesday you're phony, Thursday you're over the hill
But I'm here!
Now I've kept my clothes and kept me space
I've kept my nose to spite my face
Still once you say you won't
Keep your place loud and clear
Once you announce you're directing all you hear is...
Everybody says don't, everybody says don't
Everybody says don't, it isn't right!
Don't, it isn't nice!
Everybody says don't, everybody says...
Don't tell me not to live, just sit and putter,
Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter,
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade.
Don't tell me not to fly, I've simply got to, If someone takes a spill,
It's me and not you,
Who told you you're allowed to rain on my parade
I'll march my band out, I'll beat my drum,
And if I'm fanned out, your turn at bat, sir,
At least I didn't fake it, hat, sir,
I guess I didn't make it
Get ready for me love, 'cause I'm a-comin'
I simply gotta march, my heart's a-drummin'
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade,
I'm gonna live and live NOW!
Get what I want, I know how!
One roll for the whole shebang!
One throw that bell will go clang,
Eye on the target and wham,
One shot, one gun shot and bam!
Hey, look at me world, here I am...
I'll march my band out, I'll beat my drum,
And if I'm fanned out, your turn at bat, sir,
At least I didn't fake it, hat, sir,
I guess I didn't make it
Get ready for me life, 'cause I'm a-comin'
I simply gotta march, my heart's a-drummin'
Nobody, no, nobody, is gonna rain on my parade!

[speaking] I've always loved singing theater songs because they tell a story, and this next song that I'm about to sing is from ""SHOW BOAT"", which is on its way back to Broadway after sixty-seven years.

Barbra Streisand,"The night is bitter
The stars have lost their glitter
The winds grow colder
Suddenly you're older
And all because of the man that got away...
No more his eager call,
The writing's on the wall
The dreams you've dreamed have all gone astray
The man that won you, has run off and undone you
That great beginning, has seen the final inning
Don't know what happened, it's all a crazy game...
No more that old time thrill
For you've been through the mill
And never a new love will be the same
Good riddance, good-bye
Every trick of his, you're on to
But fools will be fools
And where's he gone to?
The road gets rougher
It's lonelier and tougher
With hope you burn up
Tomorrow he may turn up
There's just no let up
But live lone night and day
Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one man woman looking for the man
That got away...
The man that got away...

With the gentleness you feel inside (I feel it) 
Your love can't be denied 
The truth will set you free 
You'll have what's meant to be 
All in time you'll see 
Ooh, I love him (then show him) 
Of that much I can be sure (hold him close to you) 
I don't think I could endure 
If I let him walk away 
When I have so much to say 

Tell him 
Tell him that the sun and moon 
Rise in his eyes 
Reach out to him 

And whisper 
Tender words so soft and sweet 
Hold him close to feel his heart beat 
Love will be the gift you give yourself 

Love is light that surely glows 
In the hearts of those who know 
It's a steady flame that grows 
Feed the fire with all the passion you can show 
Tonight love will assume its place 
This memory time cannot erase 
Your faith will lead love where it has to go

Teach me how to please you

They like to give advice, girl!
Don't think about it twice, girl!
It's time to get to work!
Art isn't easy
Even when you're hot
Advancing art is easy
Financing it is not
A vision's just a vision if it's only in your head
If no one gets to hear it, it's as good as dead
It has to come to life
Bit by bit, putting it together
Piece by piece, only way to make a work of art
Every moment makes a contribution
Every little detail plays a part
Having just a vision's no solution
Everything depends on execution
Putting it together, that's what counts

Ounce by ounce, putting in together
Small amounts, adding up to make a work of art
First of all you need a good foundation
Otherwise it's risky from the start
Takes a little cocktail conversation
But without the proper preparation
Having just a vision's no solution
Everything depends on execution
The art of making art
Is putting it together, bit by bit
Link by link, making the connections, yes we do!
Drink by drink, taking every comment as it comes
Learning how to play the politician
Like you play piano, bass and drums
Otherwise you'll find your composition
Isn't gonna get much exhibition
Art isn't easy
Every minor detail is a major decision
Have to keep things in scale
Have to hold to your vision
What's a little cocktail conversation
If it gets the funds for your foundation
Every time I start to feel defensive
I remember vinyl is expensive!
Maybe one!
Dot by dot, building up the image
Shot by shot, keeping at a distance doesn't pay
Still if you remember your objective
Not give all your privacy away
A little bit of hype can be effective
As long as you can keep it in perspective
Even when you get some recognition
Everything you do you still audition

Art isn't easy
Overnight you're a trend
You're the right combination
Then the trend's at an end
You're suddenly last year's sensation
All they ever want is repetition
All they really like is what they know
Gotta keep a link with your tradition
Gotta learn to trust your intuition
While you re-establish your position
So that you can be on exhibit
So that your work can be on exhibition!
Be new, girl!
They tell you till they're blue, girl!
You're new, or else you're through, girl!
And even if it's true, girl
You do what you can do!

Piece by piece, working on the vision night and day
All it takes is time and perseverance
With a little luck along the way
Putting in a personal appearance
Gathering supporters and adherents
Mapping out the songs but in addition
Harmonizing each negotiation
Balancing the part that's all musicians
With the part that's strictly presentation
Balancing the money with the mission
Till you have the perfect orchestration
Even if you do have the suspicion
That it's taking all your concentration
The art of making art
Is putting it together, bit by bit
Beat by beat, part by part
Sheet by sheet, chart by chart track by track
By by reel
By stack, snit by snit
By meal, shout by shout
By deal, spat by spat
Shpiel by shpiel
And that, is the state of the art!",Putting It Together,2000

I gaze out through my window at a dozen other windows
Then I plug in my artificial tree
And like a dream I begin to remember every Christmas I used to know
A thousand miles away, a million years ago
I remember sky.
It was blue as ink
Or at least I think
I remember sky
I remember snow, soft as feathers, sharp as thumbtacks
Coming down like lint
And it made you squint when the wind would blow
And ice like vinyl on the streets
Cold as silver, white as sheets
Rain like strings and changing things
Like leaves
I remember leaves
Green as spearmint
Crisp as paper
I remember trees
Bare as coat racks, spread like broken umbrellas
And parks and bridges, ponds and zoos
Ruddy faces, muddy shoes
Light and noise and bees and boys
And daaaaays, oh!
I remember days or at least I try

In a very unusual way you were my friend

But somehow it will never end

In a very unusual way I want to cry
Something inside me goes weak
Something inside me surrenders
And you’re the reason why, you’re the reason why

You don’t know what you do to me, you don’t have a clue
You can’t tell what it’s like to be me looking at you
It’s scares me so that I can hardly speak

In a very unusual way I owe what I am to you
Though at times it appears I won’t stay, I never go

How could I ever forget you once you had touched my soul?

In hearts that are listening like ours
And old dreams find young wings
In silence, in silence

Sings a soft and soulful tune

You share my pillow
Making love to me

Here, as we share
The silent moon

As it slowly sails above us
In it's solitary flight
Seems the moon
Must surely love us
As it bathes us in it's light

Through a sunlit afternoon
Let your kisses say 
You'll stay here
And make love to me

To a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern
Where the sun has never shone

Was it something that you said?

And leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming
Just the fingers of your hand?

Pictures hanging in a hallway
And the fragment of a song
Half-remembered names and faces
But to whom do they belong?

You were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning
To the color of his hair?

I see a door to a garden and wander in.
And though my journey has barely begun
I am spun like a top to the top of the universe and
High in a spiral of ice I gaze upon a scene
That flickers far below me.
And what I see is a crinkle of colors and sounds.
Colors and sounds.

I can hear tinkles of crystal
And I can see sparkles of mist on the spangles
And I can feel tangles of tingles and sprinklings of angles
And inklings of angels around.

A rabbit crosses my path unexpectedly.
I hear a sigh of despair as he passes me.
I have a feeling that rabbit is late
For wherever he's going whatever he's headed for is my destination.
Oh, show me the way to stay here in this world
Because here's where the right things happen.
Oh baby here's where the good things are.

Looking at this enormous butterfly,
Wondering if he cares to dance with me.
Delicate as a flower carved of chrysophrase,
Idly I ponder how far have I yet to find it.
I've got to find it and act as though I've lost it.
Otherwise I'm lost in wonderland.

I've got to find it or else I am bound
To the empty ground bleak and vast.
Where dark spells are cast.

Flooring above me and ceiling below me
And chandeliers rising like tremulous towers
And tables and chairs, beds hanging like blossoms
In turquoise and purple and green.

You were asleep so I guess you were not aware,
I took a walk through your mind and I lingered there.
But what I found I can never reveal to you
Not with my words nor the pitch of my flute recall it.

One day into that wonderland shining behind your eyes,
Beyond the gossamer doors of sleep.

To think of things, lost and done
You wonder why she left so soon
No word or reason why
All feelings born can only die 

Lazy days passing by
With memories you just can't hide
The song flows on you can't pursue
Your words don't mean a thing
The mood's too hard for you to sing 

Moving on with a sigh
A silhouette against the sky
The seconds they dripped right on by
And slowly filled the day
And feelings born can only fade away",Song With No Meaning,1972
Barclay James Harvest,"Sky was black, Lord, rain came pouring down
Number 12 bus shuffling down Shaw Road way
Mules keep spinning, black-faced lifers peck the ground
Sun comes up like lightning over Tandle Hills grey 
We are mill boys, stuck on the hill boys
Stuck in the mill boys, 'till our dying day
We are mill boys, stuck on the hill boys
Stuck in the mill boys, 'till our dying day


Cotton mill will get you, boy, she'll take you to your grave
Tell you boy to use your head, apprentice out your days
You'll end up a nothing, buy, with cotton as your trade
Sun comes up like lightning over Tandle Hills grey 

We are mill boys, stuck on the hill boys
Stuck in the mill boys, 'till our dying day
We are mill boys, stuck on the hill boys
Stuck in the mill boys, 'till our dying day


It's easy to see a poor boy's blues
When he's working every day
It's harder to be there in his shoes
He was born to be that way",Mill Boys,1974
Barclay James Harvest,"Forgive me, child, I am sorry
I can't see your face
Forgive me, child, I am sorry
I can't hear your name

Take me, take you, lost in other worlds
Take me, take you, crazy boy, lonely girl
Far away, far away, what d'you say?
Far away, so far away
Hey Jude 

I was, you were, time was when I could
I knew you knew me
So light your light shining and star bright
Through you, through me, too

Take me, take you, crazy boy, lonely girl
Far away, far away, what d'you say?

Barclay James Harvest,"The eyes of night march slowly by
The last grain falls
The kneeling man just sighs
Protected by the one great wall
Of coloured parts
He probes his clouded mind
If he takes a look around him
Is there nothing left to see
Is there nothing left at all
After the day

With trembling hands he wipes his eyes
He tries to stand
But does not feel the need
The morning sun shines on
The multicoloured cross
Left standing through it all

If he takes a look around him
Is there nothing left to see
Is there nothing left at all
After the day

If he takes a look around him
Is there nothing left to see
Is there nothing left at all
After the day
",After the Day,1974
Barclay James Harvest,"Running alone in the crazy city
Look at the face of once were pretty
People then wonder what happened
To make it that way 
Listen around you, have you heard?
Climb on the back of a silver bird
London to L.A. before you can think
What to say 

Stop awhile, take a smile
Know that you're living in today
Up and down, look around
No need to hide yourself away 

Out in the country's where I'm going
Back where the tree of life's still growing
Take a free ride where the tide
Flows the way of your heart 

Follow the wild dove where he's flying
Out where the sun is never crying
Wait at the gate or they'll stop you
And blow you apart 

Stop awhile, take a smile
Know that you're living in today
Up and down, look around
No need to hide yourself away",Crazy City,1974

Take a look at what lies all around you
Then pray God we can live in peace

Everyone is everybody else
Everyone's a no-one 'till he wants to make a stand

Barclay James Harvest,"Didn't anybody see his hand move faster
Than the lightning in his eyes
Oh! what a cold surprise the flying horses cried
And didn't anybody want to ask the calliope

To call the tune
The flying horses crooned but did not know 
The Medicine Man sits on the stage
Eats fire and water, earth and air while we all stare

The silver blade burns bright
And tells us to beware
Of mirrored passages that throw a thousand images
Of younger days
The wheel spins slower as it calls us back to play 

Round and round now we go
Shout your name to the wind
As it spins by your side
Colored lights echo as the sound slips on by
Could that have been me?",Medicine Man,1974
Barclay James Harvest,"For fifty-five days I've been flying around the world
Didn't anybody know, didn't anyone suppose
That my life up here was slowly drifting by
And all I've got to do is sit and cry 
The Earth is so clear and it's simply a reach away
I just had to laugh today but the news it seemed to say
That my life once full was surely running dry
I prayed a while but then I had to cry 

Look in my eyes I know
That man is surely just a man
It's no surprise I know
The road is far too long
And life too short to carry on 

For fifty-five days I've been flying around the world
Here in syncopated time, while my tangled web of rhyme
Dangles aimlessly, time drips slowly by
And all I've got to do is sit and cry 

Look in my eyes I know
That man is surely just a man
It's no surprise I know
The road is far too long
And life too short to carry on",Negative Earth,1974
Barclay James Harvest,"Their spirits soar on high
They wing with birds that float on by
Your love and mine 
Their spirits with the breeze
That gently plays the summer leaves
Your love and mine 

Life is a bird in the sky
Life is the breeze blowing by
Time picked the words
Time picked the songs
But we sang them wrong 

Their spirits with the rain
That feeds the wheat and weeds the same
Your love and mine

The sun their spirits light
That feels and warms both black and white
Your love and mine 

Life is the rain from on high
Life is the sun in the sky
Time picked the words
Time picked the songs
We were the choir
But we sang them wrong 

Their spirits bless the cruel
The intellectual, the fool
Your love and mine 

Their spirits point the way
But who has noticed, who will say
Your love or mine? 

Life is a soft lullaby
Soothing a child as it cries
But it cries in pain
Time wrote the songs
We hear the cry
And still we sing wrong",Hymn for the Children,1975
Barclay James Harvest,"In my life I have seen so many things
Some were true and some were not what they seemed
In my life I've seen love and I've seen loss
There've been times when I did not count the cost 
I have been to a place where chaos rules
In the caves of the talking stoned the fools
Seen the stars plant their seeds and watch them grow
Just to keep mister reap but never sow 

In my life I've seen greed and I've seen hate
Seen the first to accuse the last to praise
Tried so hard to find just one saving grace

But I was young did not know
Grace is for God
Greed is to know
Mister middle of the road
Reaps what you sow",In My Life,1975
Barclay James Harvest,"You took all my money
I gave you no name
My love and my money
Did you think I would chase it in the rain? 
My eyes are now open
But what do I see?
One ride after midnight
Had I thought it would mean that much to me? 

Everybody needs someone to love
Everybody needs a friend
Everybody needs someone to care
Do you think you can make it in the end?
Do you think that you can make it, my friend? 

I thought it was easy
But what did I know
Of old men and first blood
Or the drunk who gets taken blow by blow? 

The dice are all loaded
You pay by the throw
But you pay the loser
Seems the rain is turning into snow 

We stand round your doorways
You hang on the walls
Your frames are your windows
Put your bodies on the stalls
You take all our money
We leave you no name
We're dealt just the one card
But the dealer plays in every game",One Night,1975
Barclay James Harvest,"The long and winding road that leads to your door
Here comes the sun it's alright people shout for more

But were you trying to deceive telling me
All you need is love to succeed 

Lady Madonna let it be
Something in the way you moved me yesterday

All you need is love so they say


Across the universe one after nine 'o' nine
I got a feeling for you blue and I feel fine

I tried so hard to make believe that I'd see
All you need is love to succeed

Something in the way you moved me yesterday

Barclay James Harvest,"The rock on which I stand is slowly sinking in the sand
The sheer realities of life are rushing by
I am looking out at life and I don't know what's wrong or right
And I can't even see the bright side of the moon

I stopped a man in the street today
And I asked him ""Sir, is it night or day?""
He just stared (smiled) in disbelief
I asked again but he walked away
He said ""Don't you know?""
I said ""Can't you say? Is there something inbetween?
Is it something I've not seen?
Did it change so fast or was it just a dream?"" 

Time and time again I've tried to recreate the past few days
Evaluate the constants from the haze
But every time I think I'm right, they say I'm wrong
""This day is night and night is day -
It's there in black and white""
Night is light and dark is day
If I disagree they say I'm insane
And the treatment will begin
If I say that the day is light
They just point my eyes to the blinding night, saying
""We can't set you free if you always disagree,
So the State is going to pay your doctor's fee"" 

They put me out in the pouring rain
To enjoy the sun or to feel the pain
Of the nightmare life's become
I asked a man in the street today
Or was it yesterday or the day before?
""Is there something I've not seen?
Is there something inbetween?
Did it change so fast or was it just a dream?"" 

The rock on which I stand is now beneath the ever-flowing sand
The sheer realities are here to stay
I'm looking out at life and now I know what's wrong and right
It's what you hear and what you read and what they say


I saw a man in the street today
Ask another man ""Is it night or day?""
He just stared (smiled) in disbelief
He said ""Friend, it's your lucky day
I'm a party man, won't you step this way?""
I've got something you've not seen
Now I know it's not a dream
It just came so fast, that something inbetween",May Day,1976
Barclay James Harvest,"I was down on the east side
On a block with no name
When I walked in a movie
You were blue, I was game 
Tell me, did you love it, baby?
Did you think your smile looked right?
Tell me when you came together
Was it in your mind 'cause it sure wasn't out of sight 

Didn't know when I entered
Second seat, second row
It was then that I saw you
But your mouth stole the show 

Tell me, did you love it, baby?
Did you think your smile looked right?
Tell me when you came together
Was it in your mind 'cause it sure wasn't out of sight 

Got your name, got your number
Got your form on the line
I don't know who you're under
But I know it ain't mine

Burns the ground around us where we lie
Sad old black-faced thunder will you rise

Dry our seas and rivers with your light
Universal sentinel you are
Guide of all who look on from afar

Punish all who've fallen from your grace
You whose power leaves the deepest scar

Barclay James Harvest,"The higher you fly, the harder you fall
The way that it goes, so they say
No mountain's too high, no valley too low
No river too wide on the way
So you're gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna make it on your own
Write a song that everyone can sing along
So you want to take a trip to the stars
Can you find your way back home?
You'll get your break, but don't you wait too long

The harder you try, the lower you fall
The way that it seems, so they say
The mountain is high, the valley so low
You're losing your dreams on the way

So you're gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna make it on your own
Write a song that everyone can sing along
So you want to take a trip to the stars
Can you find your way back home?
You'll get your break, but don't you wait too long

Looking behind you
All the bad times that you've had
Looking before you
Only good times?

So you're gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna make it on your own
Write a song that everyone can sing along
So you want to take a trip to the stars
Can you find your way back home?
You'll get your break, but don't you wait too long
Now don't you wait too long

Barclay James Harvest,"I woke up to a feeling, it was cold by my side
You had gone with the sunrise, leaving tears in my eyes
I got up with a feeling of an emptiness inside
To the noise of the sidewalk and the silence of my mind 

Well I walked out this morning, down a street with no name
To a club called ""The Loser"", like a dog that's gone lame
Took the club elevator to the floor with a view
I took out life subscription - it's the only one they do 

I stepped out on the guard rail, saw the crowds slowly part
Heard a voice shouting ""Don't jump, please for God's sake let me move my car!""
Felt a hand on my shoulder, heard a voice cry ""Just in time!""
Felt the quick push, felt the air rush
Felt the sidewalk, fell in line",Suicide,1976

Way up in the clouds
The trees resound with open arms
For one so rare
Brother Man just can't compare

When we're sitting on the banks
of the sunshine
We hear your song
High above the living

Brother gull, see him soar the sky
He's so pleased to be
Buoyant and triumphant
On the raging sea
Backing nature, feeling free

Loving nature, rest your head
Hear the message, man is dead
See the cities fall
While Brother Bird still.... flies!

Brother Lark, see him wake the day
See him fly on by
Above the streets now empty
To his mournful cry
Brother Man just heaves a sigh

of the sunshine
We hear your song
High above the living
Yes, we hear your song...

The grass was green and the water pure
They turned the key and opened the door

Now she walks along the seashore
And she listens to the sea
But I can't say if she ever thinks of me

Or just a drop of water in her hand
A pebble or a broken shell
A rock upon the shore
I doubt if I could love her any more

Yes, I want you
Yes, I love you, love you

'Cause I need you
Yes, I want you
Yes, I love you, love you, love you",Poor Man's Moody Blues,1977
Barclay James Harvest,"We steered our ship to the Sea of all Tranquility
The only sound our voices, as star-struck we fly
Our hopes ever high
That the songs we sing and the words we bring
Should never die 

We set our sights on the Sea of all Tranquility
Our pointless flight betraying now fallen we are
(Gods of old now broken and defaced)
Compared to a star
And the final reach to that barren beach
Is much too far 

Yesterday our songs of glory shone
A dream of ages every one
We sold our souls for senseless gain
And brought our harvest home in vain
(Above the seven seas is one) 

Yesterday our songs of glory shone
A dream of ages every one
We sold our souls for senseless gain
And brought our harvest home in vain",Sea of Tranquility,1977
Barclay James Harvest,"Valley's deep and the mountain's so high
If you want to see God you've got to move on the other side
You stand up there with your head in the clouds
Don't try to fly you know you might not come down
Don't try to fly, dear God, you might not come down
Jesus came down from Heaven to earth
The people said it was a virgin birth
Jesus came down from Heaven to earth
The people said it was a virgin birth

He told great stories of the Lord
And said he was the saviour of us all
He told great stories of the Lord
And said he was the saviour of us all

For this they/we killed him, nailed him up high
He rose again as if to ask us why
Then he ascended into the sky
As if to say in God alone you soar
As if to say in God alone we fly.

Valley's deep and the mountain's so high
If you want to see God you've got to move on the other side
You stand up there with your head in the clouds
Don't try to fly you know you might not come down
Don't try to fly, dear God, you might not come down
