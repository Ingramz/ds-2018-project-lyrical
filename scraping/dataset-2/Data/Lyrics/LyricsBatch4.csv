Aaron Carter,"I see you everyday
And I can't seem to think of anything to say
To you, baby, how can it be
That breaks my heart when you're smiling at me

The moment that I laid my eyes on you (my eyes on you)
I knew you'd be the one to make my dreams come true

Girl you shine like reflections on the water
Girl you shine like the sun in the sky
Girl you shine like the moon does in the night time
Girl you shine like the stars in the sky

In you I see something I won't find
Never again, baby, you're always on my mind
If I could find a way to open up my heart
We'd be together, we'd not be apart

The moment that I laid my eyes on you (my eyes on you)
I knew you'd be the one to make my dreams come true

Girl you shine like reflections on the water
Girl you shine like the sun in the sky
Girl you shine like the moon does in the night time
Girl you shine like the stars in the sky

Girl I can't imagine being without you
And I know you're gonna make my dreams come true
You know I'll never leave you, I'll never deceive you
I'll give you every piece of my heart

Girl you shine
(Shine) shine (shine) shine on me
Girl you shine
(Shine) shine (shine) shine on me
Girl you shine
(Shine) shine (shine) shine on me
Girl you shine
(Shine) shine (shine) shine on me

Girl you shine like reflections on the water
Girl you shine like the sun in the sky
Girl you shine like the moon does in the night time
Girl you shine like the stars in the sky

You're all I need to survive 
And girl you keep me alive 
And girl you shine like the sun in the sky",Girl You Shine (Interlude: Big Band 'Shine-Y' Beat Box),2000
Aaron Carter,"And it goes, and it goes
And it goes a little something like this

Hit it!
Aaron's in the house
Come on
Get up get up
I want to make it bounce
Here we go
Aaron's in the house
Get up get up
Aaron's in the house

Yo guys, check it out
Guess what happened to me
(Another crazy story, come on AC)
I was hanging at the court
Just playing some ball
Working on my game
(Yeah, we heard it all)
I heard the fans screaming
I thought it was for me

But then I saw a shadow
It was twelve foot three
It was Shaquile O'Neal
(What? What did he say?)
(How 'bout some one-on-one, do you want to play?)
I told him why not, I got some time
But when I beat you real bad
Try not to cry

(Please Aaron, are you for real?)
(One-on-one with Shaquile O'Neal?)
Yeah, 34 Centre from the L.A. Lakers
(You must've been nervous)
I knew I could take him
Stared' at Shaq, psyche him out
I said O'Neal, you're in my house now
Start the game the whistle blows
Pay attention close 'cause the story goes

It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq

It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq

So check it out
I thought I had the lead
But then he started scoring mad points on me
I was scorin' the bricks
Was he hitting those shots?
I knew that there was a way that I could make it stop

I had a plan, that I could change the pace
I said, Yo Shaq you didn't tie your shoelace
He looked down, I stole the ball
I'm taking him to school now, watch me all
A 3-pointer, nothing but net
Come on Shaq, had enough yet?
Down by two, I'm catching up
I guess your getting nervous
'Cause you already lost

It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq

Dunk after dunk
Jam after jam
Cheerleaders are cheering
Aaron's the man

Dunk after dunk
Jam after jam
Cheerleaders are cheering
Aaron's the man

Announcers were shocked
Couldn't believe it was real
(I can't believe a kid just stuffed O'Neal)
One more second, was all that remained
I put the ball up
I put him in shame
I must admit that it sounds real crazy
but the ball went in
Then he cried like a baby
Sorry Shaq, I should've let you win
You're good too
And we can still be friends

The fans went nuts
They put me on their shoulders
Then I heard a voice
And it sounded like my mother's

(Get up for school, you're gonna be late!)
Ma, can't you see that I'm playing the game?
(How you could be playing if you're still in bed?)
(Are you gettin' sick, did you hit your head?)
Aw, man it was all a dream
I guess that kinda thing could never happen to me

If it was a dream and it wasn't real

How'd I get a jersey with the name O'Neal?
Woah

It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq

It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts

Aaron Carter,"[Verse 1]
I got a friend and I may just get him
Ready and a push with a mic in my right hand
Move you, groove you
Get something to dance to, if you want to
Step outside, come along, let's ride
Don't listen to the talk, take a walk on the wild side
Thinkin', talkin', clockin', everybody's shockin', and rockin

Cause you know and I know
that we rule the dance floor
If the DJ's too slow-slow
I guess that it's a no-no, no-no

Jump jump to the left to the right
Jump jump and turn around
Jump jump and touch the ground

Aaron Carter,"Unemployment at a record high
People coming, people going, people born to die
Don't ask me, because I don't know why
But it's like that, and that's the way it is

People in the world try to make ends meet
You try to ride car, train, bus, or feet
I said you got to work hard to want to compete
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!

Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups and your downs, your highs and your lows
Won't you tell me last time that love bought you clothes?
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Bills fly higher every day
We receive much lower pay
I'd rather stay young, go out and play
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!

War's going on across the sea
Street soldiers killing the elderly
What ever happened to unity?
It's like that, and that that's the way it is

Disillusion is the word
That's used by me when I'm not heard
I just go through life with my glasses blurred
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!

You can see a lot in this lifespan
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
You notice one time he was your man
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is

You should've gone to school, you could've learned a trade
But you laid in bed where the bums have laid
Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!

One thing I knoe is that life is short
So listen up homeboy, give this a thought
The next time someone's teaching why don't you get taught?
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is

If you really think about it times aren't that bad
The one that stretches for success will make you glad
Stop playing start praying, you won't be sad
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!

When you feel you fail sometimes it hurts
For a meaning in life is why you search
Take the boys on the train, drive to school on the church
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Here's another point in life you should not miss
Do not be a fool who's prejudice
Because we're all written down on the same list
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh! (Repeat 4x)

You know it's like that, and that's the way it is
Because it's like that, and that's the way it is",It's Like That,2000

Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up

Shoulda known something was up
When I got up
Something felt funny to me
From the get up
Jumped up out of the bed
With my head up

Guess who was staring at me?
An ET or an alien
But he said his name was Steve
And he didn't look like what I thought he would be
He said ""Aaron, will you help me please
Get your space suit and come with me""

So we hoped up, in the space truck
It was all combed out with the system up
And I thought we were going to Mars
We made a left
At the dipper
Never figured that we'd be here with a space majiggy

We got there and I read a sign
It said ""Welcome AC, it's about time
Can you show us,
Can you help us,
To dance tonight?
'Cause we have no rhythm
And we're running outta time""

There's a universe of rhythm
And the beat don't stop in AC's Alien Nation

And we only have one mission

Here's what you got to do
You take one step up
Don't try to take two
Make sure that you bump your fists like this
Nod like this, and rock like this

To a be together, stay together
Know we gonna innovate
Moonwalk, star drop
A universal big top

Circus notice, and you gotta know this
It really doesn't matter
If you're short or tall
Green or blue
Fat or bald
'Cause I came with a groove
And I'm proving it all
Around these parts we don't take no show

With the unity soon to be in the streets
You can see with your own eyes
How far we've come
'Cause we didn't have rhythm, now we've got some
It's just another day in the AC Nation

Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, lil' mama
Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, I met myself a cowgirl
What she want? Put me on

Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, lil' mama
Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, lil' mama
Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, I met myself a cowgirl
What she want? Put me on

Okay, this is how it went down
Sunday afternoon with the fellas at the play ground
Chillin', my father honked his horn at me
Said, I have a show in Texas and I gotta leave

Texas, wow! I've never been
Maybe I can find a new hang out friend
Anyway, packin' up my bags on my way
Signing autographs as I run to catch the plane

I seen her, chubby cheeks with long braids
Cute face, same age, she played hard to get
As I offered out my name, she just walked away
With a smile, oh, my little cowgirl

Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, lil' mama

Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, I met myself a cowgirl
What she want? Put me on

Okay, now the plane landed
She's been on my mind so much I can't stand it
My manger kept rushin' me to go
I tried to look for her, I'd give a ticket to the show

I thought, I see a cowboy hat but everyone was ready
And our luggage was packed
Hesitant for leavin' my heaven sent cowgirl
We ran off to the hotel

As I practice in the hotel lobby
She was on my mind full time
The fellas tryin' to cheer me up
I came down with a case of Puppy Love

I went back to havin' fun, dancin' makes ya thirsty
Plus, it was time for lunch at the hotel restaurant
Order me some burgers and fries
Then to my surprise, walked in my cowgirl

Break it down, little lady
Break it down
I met myself a cowgirl, put me on

Break it down, little lady
Break it down, little lady
Break it down
I met myself a cowgirl, put me on

And now I'm on the stage
Performing in front of a capacity
The screamin' guys and screamin' girls
But still no sign of my cowgirl

As I head to the other front part of the stage
There she stood, with a smile on her face
My cowgirl, took her by the hand
Brought her on stage and I started to dance
With my cowgirl

Like Batman, Spiderman, Superman, I can be your man
Be my Jane, I'll be Tarzan
Romeo for Juliet she'll never have another story in motive
They were made for each other
Babe Ruth had his bat
Tiger Woods and Nike hat

I'll give you all of this, you know that I could So give me one chance to say I would

Going around the room talking about our favorite noise
I said I had a brother in the Backstreet Boys
So everyone screamed

Hey is this some kinda trick

Yea, which one is he?

The blonde one, Nick
Then the cutest girl said:

I have to see their show
But I have no ticket, Aaron
How can I go

Your wish is my command
See it's no problem, hon
In fact I'll get some tickets here for everyone
All I gotta is pick up the celly
And its a done deal
Let me call Nick and tell him

By the way Aaron, if you could, while you're at it
Can you hook up some seats
For my friends and my parents?

So I said to myself, well heck, why not?
There's nothing that can beat the connection I got

Aaron, oh Aaron
What are you going to do?
You make empty promises oh so big

How gonna make them come true?

What are we going to do with you?

Always a-makin' a fool

Hey Nick
I need a favor from you, dude
I promised people tickets
So you gotta come through

Sure, bro, how many do you need?

1, 2, uh, 3003

What?!
I can get you maybe a dozen
You can't promise seats to everyone and their cousin
What did you do? 
How'd you get in this mess?

I was talkin' to this girl

Hold your breath
I know the rest
Guess you better get yourself a whole lotta money

For 3000 tickets?
Nick, that's isn't funny.
How'm I supposed to pull that off in so little time?

You got me, Aaron
That's your problem, not mine

Aaron, oh Aaron
(Aaron: What do I do?)
What are you going to do?
You make empty promises oh so big

How gonna make them come true?

What are we going to do with you?
(Aaron: I don't know)

(Aaron: So, it was just one mistake)
Always a-makin' a fool

How in the world can he do that to me?
I thought we were blood.
I thought we were family.
We're gettin' to the show
We'll get good seats
Everyone on the bus, you're all coming with me
I'm tellin' you guys when we get to the gate
He can never say ""no"" when he looks at my face
Hook me up! Nick, Man, I swear I'll pay you back

Well come to think about, we need an opening act.

What do you want me to do: tell jokes; dance; act?

Nah, I want you on stage, I want you to rap. 
'Cause if you don't you're gonna have some disappointed friends
And by the way you're on at eight, that's when the show begins

Of all the hot girls that I miss

All the guys know what I mean
Hip hop style to retro rock
All the girls that's on my block
You've been down with me since one
And we've only just begun

Aaron Carter,"6:30, mama gets you outta bed
You e-mail what you're gonna wear to your girlfriend
You skip breakfast, forget your backpack
When you're halfway, you run back
 
You're a Daddy's angel, with a halo
Everybody's lookin' at you more like J. Lo
But there's so much more to you
 
So put me to the test
I don't hafta guess
What you want to know now, baby?
 
[Chorus]
When it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do, what you like to wear
What you're putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know The Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through, no
When it comes to you
 
Now, you're middle name is August
But I remember
You were born in November
You lived in Jersey
But you're from Ontario
Your twin sisters like to talk in stereo
 
We got so much in common
?
But there's so much more we can do
 
So put me to the test
I don't even have to sweat
What you want to know now, baby?
 
[Chorus]
 
Yeah, when it comes to you
 
I want you to know, baby, I've been studyin'
Pullin' all-nighters when I could've been partyin'
I can't fail, it's in the details
Understandin' all that which is female
 
Some guys don't ever see what they're missin'
Talkin' about their tales, when they should be listenin'
I pay attention, to the things you say to me
When it comes to you, it's in my memory
 
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
 
When it comes to you
When it comes to you",When It Comes to You,2002
Aaron Carter,"I been around on this journey
And I'm learnin', the world keeps turnin'
You gotta face the fight, just to live the dream
Who would've believed, that what I've achieved
Tourin' the globe, and all those fond memories
Who would've guessed it would be like that
 
Through it all, who's been there for me
Took care of me, even shed a tear for me
You're the one who kept it real
So, in return, this is how I feel
 
[Chorus]
Do you mind where I came from?
And I have to tell you in this song
Without you, where would I be?
(Come on, hear me out now)
No word of where this road may lead me
Hometown boy, with his face on T.V.
It's plain to see
That without you, there'd be no me
 
It's a dream that I've come so far
The ups and downs were there
But I've worked so hard
Many people don't know the life I live
Always on the road, always plannin' a show
Gettin' down to business, in the studio
I can face the day 'cause the love you give
 
Through it all when the day is done
The night's begun, you're still my number one
You're the one who kept it real
So, in return, this is how I feel
 
[Chorus]
 
One shout to my family
'Cause when things get hard they understand me
Two shouts to my boys at home
Although I'm not there, you know you're not alone
Three shouts to my label
'Cause without them I would not be able
To make the fourth shout-out
The ones I think about
The masterpiece to the master plan
That's you, the fans

Aaron Carter,"You think I'm an ignorant savage
And you've been so many places
I guess it must be so
But still I cannot see
If the savage one is me
How can there be so much that you don't know?
You don't know 

You think you own whatever land you land on
The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew, you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountains?
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun sweet berries of the Earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends

How high will the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountains
We need to paint with all the colours of the wind

You can own the Earth and still
All you'll own is Earth until
You can paint with all the colours of the wind",Colors of the Wind,2002
Aaron Carter,"I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware!
Well, I've never seen a king of beasts, with quite so little hair
I'm gonna be the main event, like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down, I'm working on my ROAR
And thus far, a rather uninspiring thing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

No one saying do this
No one saying be there
No one saying stop that
No one saying see here
Free to run around all day
Free to do it all my way!

Arranged a heart to heart
Kings don't need advice
From little hornbills for a start
If this is where the monarchy is headed
Count me out!
Out of service, out of Africa
I wouldn't hang about... aagh!

Aaron Carter,"Talking:
Here's a little bit of old school for ya,
That goes a little something like this...

I always tried to be the flyest kid in the block
The popular one with the rising stocks
So that's when I had this bright idea
Throw the party of the month
No, the party of the year

All the fine girls couldn't turn it down
Now all I gotta do is get my parents out
Should I send them to a movie
No, send them to a show
Let me think, hmm
It's gotta be long though

I said Mom, Dad, yo why ya sittin' home
It's a Friday night have you seen Aunt Jo
And don't worry about stayin' out too long
Don't fuss over me, I'll be fine alone

Have a good time

The door bell rings 'cause the party's here
I'm crankin' up the stereo like it's New Years
Walkin' 'round the house like who's Da Man
(Everybody do it like Aaron can)

First on the floor, you know that's me
Bustin' out the moves like it's MTV
I'm guessin' where I'm goin' 'cause I lost my head
Then I jumped on table, this is what I said

People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
Everyone together sing it loud
(Come get it)
Jump all around come on

Things are goin' great
Then to my surprise
Some people walked in, I didn't recognize
I said fellows yo ya gotta get out

(Hey man I heard this was an open house)
Open house?
(Yeah that's what the flyers said)
I didn't put out flyers!
(Well somebody did)

Lynn walked in
The girl I'm crushin'
And the kid spilled juice
On my Mom's new cushion

I turned around and
Another kid broke the lamp
(I hope they weren't expensive)
They got them from France
For now I won't sweat it
I'll clean it up later
There's a honey over there
And I really want to meet her

People all around you gotta

Aaron see's in the house, here we go
Come with it

Break it down
(Go go go go go)

Is that a car door
Oh dang I'm in trouble
Everybody get out now
On the double
I'm dead (your done) that's it for me
I'm gonna be picked off my family tree

Once Mom finds out 'bout this party I had
I don't want to even start thinkin' about dad
I'm hustlin' around the house
Trying to clean up the mess
I sure put my new white Nikes to the test

The car door slammed
And they're walking up the steps
I guess life is good with ten seconds left

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

¿Y que puedo hacer? 
Esperar por ella sin perder la calma

Dicen que es mejor
Mantener la calma
Que su corazón se escapó de mi
Pero aún me extraña
Que no pudo ser
Que entregó sus armas
Justo cuando más le hacían falta
Dicen que la fe mueve las montañas
Que la tempestad dura lo que el sol
Tarde en alejarla
Pero estoy aquí, llueve en mi ventana
Solo con mis ganas de encontrarla

Hasta el sol de hoy
Y no la he vuelto a ver
Hasta el sol de hoy
Y yo no se mañana
¿Y que puedo hacer? 
Se secó mi alma
Hasta el sol de hoy
Y no la he vuelto a ver

¿Y que puedo hacer? 
Esperar por ella sin perder la calma

(Hasta el sol de hoy y no la he vuelto a ver)
Esperar por ti es lo que puedo hacer
(Hasta el sol de hoy y yo no se mañana)
Y es que aún mi corazón te extraña
(Hasta el sol de hoy y no la he vuelto a ver)
Como el sol de las mañana te deseo
(Hasta el sol de hoy y yo no sé mañana)
Yo sin ti no sé que hacer
(Hasta el sol de hoy y no la he vuelto a ver)
Tiembla mi piel, mi corazón, no sé que hacer
(Hasta el sol de hoy y yo no sé mañana)
Te fuiste cuando más me hacías falta

You can see the man in me.
You know I'll never argue or put up a fight.
I'll do anything you wanna do. 
So let's stay in again tonight.

What did I do this time?
Baby, baby, this time
What did I do this time?
Just to make you so mad.

We could always be like this. 
Stay like this for years.
It's gonna end in fighting, Baby. 
Gonna bet it's gonna end in tears.
Friends all say I'm crazy. 
I'm wasting my life away.

And doing anything you say.

You know I need you baby...

I just got home from off another world tour 
I'm outside  in the rain  it's beginnin' to pour 
Can't understand why you changed the locks on the door 
Got all my drawers and socks outside on the lawn
 
What's right is wrong, we used to make love to this song 
Twice as long, especially when the nights were long 
Suga even in the dark, or when the lights were on 
Sista even in the park, lover my life is gone
 
I saw the flaws, now we both grabbin' for straws 
Over some love letters you found, in the top dresser drawer 
I'm missin' you more, the sweet scent of Christian Dior 
Kissin' you more, forever promissin' you more 
We need to communicate and start listenin' more 

Baby from experience, I've been through it before 
I found the message in a bottle washed up on the shore 
Signed from, 'sincerely yours', I can't take it no more 

[Chorus: ]
No I'll never turn my back on you 
I never want to do you wrong, Suga Sista 
No I'll never turn my back on you 
I never want to do you wrong, Suga Sista

Another episode, had the keys to the Yukon 
Tried to call her on the celly but she didn't respond 
Had my finger on redial now I'm callin' her moms 
Kept gettin' the voicemail now I'm losin' my calm
 
Though she's probably with the next man, wrapped in his arms 
Probably caught up in the mix, where she didn't belong 
On the topic of trust, misgivings was leading me wrong 
On the topic of us, misgivings was treating me wrong 

Reading me wrong, now we not getting along 
You never miss a good thing baby until it is gone 
The thrill is gone, you can hear my heart, spill on this song 

Wishin' once upon a time could stand still on this song 
If the feelings is strong, then a countermove would be wrong 
If the feelings is gone, then you know it's time to move on 
If the feelings is torn, then I was right all along 
If you think that I'm wrong, then pick my drawers off the lawn 

[Chorus: ]

At first I came to a halt, it was your fault 
Had me frozen on the avenue just watchin' you walk 
Up in your presence I was caught, breath, becomin' short 
I had to step to this to let you know you had my support
 
I said, ""I'm Black Thought, from out the 2-1-5th 
Maybe you heard about the Dynasty I do run with 
Me and The Roots done ripped, from Illadel' across the planet 
Ya see, we on some shit some find it hard to understand it
 
But back, to what you all about or how you are at 
What type of science did you knowledge was your mental intact?"" 
To converse, at first, let me know you knew the day and time 
I had to catch you, mentally makin' you mine
 
While I'm lookin' at you, physical chiseled that of a statue 
Type of shit to make you travel from Philly to the Big Apple 
It feels kind of crazy, reminiscin' back through 
No need to sweat the backturnin', keep it on the true and actual
 
As I get into your thought, for all infinity 
Shower you in masculinity, reinforcin' your sense 
Of femininity, bless you with this, the true identity 
Nothin' but respect in your vicinity 

Since, the Suga Brown from the level of Foun-dation of ground 
So together we forever bound 
We could make, heavenly sounds like a musical blend 
Throughout the bad times and beautiful things, it's like that

Aaron Hall,"The First Noel, the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind has bought.

There was a reason I like you
And there's a reason I wifed you
'cause I never seen nothin' like you
So sweet, my team even like you
There's no limit to the things that I might do

And that's why you stay in the finest
Everything major, never in the minors
We dine on yachts, far from them diners
I'm by your side far from behind ya

And I ain't gotta buy cars to remind ya
Gas you up and put your heart in the grinder
You don't know what you mean to me, girl
'cause you more like a queen to me

And I want you to cling to me
'cause you came here, you changed my scenery
It was just like a dream to me, that's what it seemed to be
You need a ring, it not a thing to me

I like the things you do to me
I like, it brings out ecstasy
I like, you really turn me on
I like, I like the way
The feelings good things from you

Girl, you are my lover
When I'm with you, there is no other
A spell you got me under
Please don't you leave
I'm on my hands and knees

And now I'm back by popular demand
Rocks is in your hand, so let 'em know, girl, you gotta man
Even though you know I got a lot of fans
See me in the club with the bottles in my hand

Models on the side tryin' to holla if they can
Get a nigga home, try to swallow if they can
But you know they can't holla at your man
I'm focused so they can't bother without plans

White sand, we done, did that
London, did that, Sandrope, we done, did that
Went to Sydney and dropped dough
Trips to Morocco, Paris popped more, we did that

So ain't nothin' else left to do
But spend the rest of my life and invest in you
I know them haters be testin' you
But don't let nobody stress you, boo
You know they like that

I like the things you do to me
I like, it brings out ecstasy
I like, you really turn me on
I like, I like the way
The feelings good things from you, girl

Aeyo, now that we made our bond
It might sound crazy, ma, but it's time to get our baby on
It's time to get a life together
'cause you gon be my wife forever

'cause I made up my mind, it's crazy at times
Visions of you and a baby of mine
Half the hassle, livin' in half a castle
There's no way to act or pass you

I'm blessed to have you, pain that I loved done last through
Can't nothin in the world surpass you
I have to ask you, please be my only girl
I can't breathe in this lonely world

'cause I'm often hounded, concerts surrounded
By chicks that think Loon is astounding
But without you, ma, Loon won't be grounded
Loon would be runnin' round clownin'

I like the things you do to me
I like, it brings out ecstasy
I like, you really turn me on
I like, I like the way the feelings good things from you, girl

I like the way you wear your hair
I like the stylish clothes you wear
Way you kiss me I feel warm

Tongue-kissing, hand full of hair, look in my eyes
Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you moving in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweating up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespecting when I tongue-kiss your neck

Screaming ""Compton"", but you can't return, you ain't heard?

That a major disaster will be striking all levels of existence
It has also been reported that this disastrous thing will be
Approaching in the form of many, many as in squad
Squad as in Flipmode Squad

It has also been reported that everyone out of the many will strike
But this particular motherfucker will strike with an unmeasurable blast
That will fuck up everything within it's 360 degree radius
Warning, prepare yourselves, store your food, stamp your paper
Because when this motherfucker gets here
It's about to get real fucked up for everyone and everything

Aaron James,"There's a storm outside
And the gap between crack and thunder
Crack and thunder
Is closing in
Is closing in

The rain floods gutters
And makes a great sound on concrete

On a flat roof, there's a boy
Leaning against a wall of rain
Aerial held high
Calling ""Come on thunder
Come on thunder!""

Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes I swear I can see your soul
Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes I swear I can see your soul

It's a monsoon
And the rain lifts lids off cars
Spinning buses like toys
Stripping them to chrome
Across the bay, the waves are something else
Picking up fishing boats and spewing them on the shore

The boy's hit
Lit up against the sky
Like a sign
Like a neon sign

Then he crumples
Drops into the gutter
Cut strings
Legs twitching

The flood swells his clothes
Delivers him on

Aaron Jeoffrey,"I cover my heart, turn from the wind
Button my coat, here comes the storm again
What can I do but to trust in Him

'Cause I know the deeper my faith runs
The stronger I become
And the thunder, it may shake me
But I always know that

After the rain
You can look to the sky again
The clouds will give way
To the light of the sun

After the rain
You know that you've made it through
And you'll finally see the joy from the pain
After the rain

Everyone needs, everyone hurts
Everyone feels the weight of the world sometimes
But don't let the wind sweep your heart away

'Cause even the roughest waters cleanse
So when they come again
Let them serve as a reminder
You can always know that

After the rain
You can look to the sky again
The clouds will give way
To the light of the sun

After the rain
You know that you've made it through
And you'll finally see the joy from the pain
After the rain

Can't you see the hand of Jesus
Reaching out for you?
You never have to face the storm alone

After the rain
You can look to the sky again
The clouds will give way
To the light of the sun

Before my weary eyes
As I pray your kingdom come
Like a thief in the night
You know this world can be unkind sometimes
When you don't bow to its whims
But one day you'll take me far from here
Where the sun never dims

Beyond my eyes 
Beyond the sky
Where tears turn to hope
And hope's the way of life
Beyond my fears
Beyond here
Beyond the realm of time and space
I'll see Jesus face to face
Beyond, beyond

I know some souls who made it there
Oh God, I miss them so
They traded in their earthly cares
To kneel before your throne
But if I could see them now
I know they'd cheer me on
Down this narrow road I'm traveling on
That leads me home 
That leads me home

Beyond my eyes 
Beyond the sky
Where tears turn to hope
And hope's the way of life
Beyond my fears

Beyond the realm of time and space

Then leave me, or take me as I am

When I hear your voice, driving me insane
Hour after hour, day after day
Every lonely night that I sit and pray

We live our lives on different sides,
But we keep together you and I
Just live our lives, stigmatized

We'll live our lives, we'll take the punches everyday
We'll live our lives, I know we're gonna find a way

I believe in you, and I don't really give a damn

It’s new whips, I pull into the night club
I got them Jordan number 6 outta flight club
Sway still in seats all piped up,
And we ain't leave the club until the lights out (one more bottle)
Everyday I stay splashy like it’s Easter (Word)
That’s why they say I’m something like a fashionista
Roll some, burn some, pass the reefer

Do you think he blondes?
I guess I could be blonder
I mean, Do you think Jim Jones needs me to be blonder?
Maybe I just need to lose weight, I mean
I'm already down to like 20 pounds, but I could totally go lower
Because he is just so freaking unbelievably adorable

I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear

I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning
How quick the sun can, drop away

Aaron Lewis,"Now, I grew up down an old dirt road in a town you wouldn't know
My pop's picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks back in 1964
My grandfather was a drinker, back in the day, he put him down
But a war is known to change a man and the whiskey's known to change a man, but

That's not me
I rarely drink from the bottle but I'll smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go
In a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy is all I'll ever be

Now, its been twelve years since I sold my soul to the devil in L.A.
He said sign your name here on the dotted line and your songs, they all will play
He set up shop on Sunset, he put me up at the Marquee
He said ""you want to sell a million records boy, you better listen to me""
He said ""change your style, whiten your smile, you can lose a couple of pounds
If you want to live this life, you better lose that wife, do you need your friends around?""

And I said, no, that's not me
Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old t-shirts

Aaron Lewis,"Now, I grew up down an old dirt road in a town you wouldn't know
My pop's picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks back in 1964
My grandfather was a drinker, back in the day, he put him down
But a war is known to change a man and the whiskey's known to change a man, but

That's not me
I rarely drink from the bottle but I'll smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go
In a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy is all I'll ever be

Now, its been twelve years since I sold my soul to the devil in L.A.
He said sign your name here on the dotted line and your songs, they all will play
He set up shop on Sunset, he put me up at the Marquee
He said ""you want to sell a million records boy, you better listen to me""
He said ""change your style, whiten your smile, you can lose a couple of pounds
If you want to live this life, you better lose that wife, do you need your friends around?""

And I said, no, that's not me
Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old t-shirts
And a couple extra pounds never really hurt
'Cause a country boy is all I'll ever be

Aaron Lewis,"Sit here on the stairs and listen to 
The nighttime as the daylight fades away
It's such a haunting and familiar tune, 
When I hear it in the distance I can say that I'm home

In Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife, they wait for me, all alone
But the truth is it's where I always am, it's where I long to be
Because I am home

The north shore is where my father lives, 
I wear my Red Sox hat around the world with pride
But the Berkshires are where my heart is 
And when I see them in the distance I could cry 
Because I'm home

In Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife, they wait for me, all alone
But the truth is it's where I always am, it's where I long to be

Nyla started pre-school
Indie just turned two
And Zoe's just the perfect mix of me and you
They keep getting older 
Time keeps going by
To think about it makes your daddy wanna cry

So I just passed the sign that welcomes me to Worthington
Established long before this country came to be
A place that at hasn't really changed with time
The way this country that I love it, used to be

Because I'm home
In Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife, they wait for me, all alone
But the truth is it's where I always am, it's where I long to be
Because I am home
Where my hero teaches classes everyday 
And where my friends they don't treat me different
It's where my family is, it's where I'll always stay
Because I'm home",Massachusetts,2011
Aaron Lewis,"Another two months on the road
Just two more miles I'll be home to what I know
Where things move a little slower
And people always wave goodbye and say hello
And the maples on this road they must be three hundred years old

Of the tractors and the cars
All comin' home from Liston's bar
And the country folk just out to raise some hell
To raise some hell

This is my home
This is where I belong
Where my daughters go to school
Where opinions are strong
Where my neighbors are my friends

So I just hit the ground and keep on runnin'
All of yesterday has come and gone
And so you try to pick up all the pieces
Put it all back the way that it belongs
Well the next thing that you know
It's time to play another show
I'm leavin' out of here just after dawn
Ain't it good to know that no matter where you go
That this town has got your back when you are gone
When you are gone

And this is my home
This is where I belong
Where my daughters go to school
Where opinions are strong
And my amendment rights
They keep me safe at night
Where my neighbors are my friends

When I am lost at sea
You're the only thing
I like about me

""Son, you'd best go easy down that road""
And she said she was sorry
For all the times she couldn't save my soul

Shoulda listened to her words a little more
Before I packed up and I walked right out that door

Daddy always told me
""Son, you'd better love the best you can""
And ""Don't look back and be sorry
These moments won't be comin' 'round again""

But I feel like I could conquer the whole world
When I look up and see those three little girls

But I get lost, I can't find my way
All my pieces glued together for the world to see
Mistakes I've made, consumed by some
Till there's nothing left of me when all is said and done

Now a preacher man once told me
""Son, I'm not so sure you can be saved""
And he said, ""Life is full of choices
And He sees all the bad ones that you've made""

And I said ""Yeah, you're right, I'll probably go to Hell
But goddamn all the stories I can tell""

'Cause I'm so lost, I can't find my way
All my pieces glued together for the world to see
Mistakes I've made, consumed by some
Till there's nothing left of me when all is said and done

So my mama always told me
""Son, you'd best go easy down that road""",Mama,2016
Aaron Lewis,"We grow tobacco and we drive trucks
We kill whitetails and greenhead ducks
And drive our four wheelers down the main road
And bust out the sleds when it's cold

We got back roads an' four-wheel-drives
We got tailgates on a Friday night
And it's a half hour from my front door
To a Walmart or a grocery store

What you all don't understand
It ain't all about a southern man

'Cause we got outlaws, we got hicks
We got honkytonks out in these sticks
We love our whiskey and we love our homegrown
God damn it's so good to be home

We wear Carhart, we don't wear suits
We wear square toes and Chippewa boots
And we all know where we come from
And we'll be right here when it's done

What you all don't understand
It ain't all about the southern man

'Cause we got family livin' out in these woods
We got pride and a sense of what's good
And we all got dirt on our hands
It's a song for the workin' man

Get up early and we work third shift
Pay our taxes and protect our kids
And we all got dirt on our hands
'Cause there's rednecks north of the Mason-Dixon
There's rednecks north of the Mason-Dixon

'Cause I'm from the North son, you're from the South
Straight out the trailer, fresh off the plow
You got your Chevy parked next to my Ford
And the colors flyin' high at your door

I got a shotgun, fill it with shells
You got a Bible but I'll see you in hell
We ain't that different son, you and me
Tryin' to make it in the land of the free

What y'all don't understand
It ain't all about a southern man

Aaron Lewis,"I'll watch it all go down in flames
Knowin' there's no one to blame but me
Another vice to kill the pain
Knowin' that the pain will set me free

So I sit here starin' at the sky, and wonder why
The hands of God still hold me, and help me through this life
A sinner in so many ways, I've made it through so many days
I struggle, still lookin' for a sign

A little purpose
The story of my life

I'm haunted by the words you said
Prayin' that there's any hope for me
This holy war inside my head
Is probably not the safest place to be

So I sit here starin' at the sky, and wonder why
The hands of God still hold me, and help me through this life
A sinner in so many ways, I've made it through so many days
I struggle, still lookin' for a sign

A little purpose
The story of my life
The story of my life

So as the darkness turns to day
The light it shows the depth of my disguise
My safety was naivety
Created by deception and with lies

Aaron Lewis,"I've seen drunk girls singin' karaoke
I've seen old timers pray to their beer
And we all seem to have our sad stories to tell
That's how we all ended up here

Washin' away all our problems
Gettin' baptised in those neon lights
And the drunker I get, the more things I forget
And I just ain't got that kind of time

So that's why I like drinkin' whiskey
Because it fills up the cracks in my soul
And it helps me forget all the damage I've done
And all the time I've spent down in this hole

And for a moment I swear I hear Jesus
Sayin' ""Son, it'll all be alright""
So I take one more shot of redemption, Lord
It's like Sunday every Saturday night

Now the gospel comes out of that jukebox
And an angel just walked through the door
And she pulled up a chair right beside me
She said, ""You think misery's got room for one more?""

So that's why I like drinkin' whiskey
Because it fills up the cracks in my soul
And it helps me forget all the damage I've done
And all the time I've spent down in this hole

And for a moment I swear I hear Jesus
Sayin' ""Son, it'll all be alright""
So I take one more shot of redemption, Lord
It's like Sunday every Saturday night

Now the bar stools are lined up like church pews
And the preacher just yelled out ""Last call!""
And confession is held belly-up to the bar
Hell even the best angels fall

Now that my heart 
Has finally found a way
 
To start living out loud
My soul's been dying
To scream and shout
And shatter the silence
It's a beautiful sound, 
When each moment counts
Right here, right now
I'm gonna start living out loud

To scream and shout
And shatter the silence
It's a beautiful sound, 
When each moment counts
Right here and now
I'm gonna start, living out loud

Bobby had everything 
He thought he'd ever need
A fancy new car 
And a master's degree
Still he's feeling lost, 
With no purpose in life
And nothing seems to fill 
The empty space inside
He sees an ad on late night TV
Says ""Change a kid's life with 
Just a couple hours a week""

Just surfing around
But something makes him stop 
And write that number down

Where's no time for herself

No money, no romance, no end in sight

She sees a painting on the fridge

When we make love
It feels brand new
And I can't imagine my life without you
The world stands still as we move
And I know that we're two of the lucky few
When we make love

Baby hold on tight, don't ever let go
I wanna feel you in my arms and my soul

Baby, I must confess
I was tongue tied, but inside
My mind got way ahead of me
I'm stuck in this confusion
Trapped in some illusion
It's all because of you

Somebody help me
I need an ice cold glass of water
You left me out here in the desert
I'm losing it, hallucinating
Somebody save me
Pour me a strong cup of coffee
My eyes are playing tricks on me
What's happening
Girl, you got me seeing things

Sunlight on your face
Waking up with you each day
My shirt on you
Just the thought's driving me crazy
It's like I'm in a daze
Some kind of lovesick haze
Before I go insane

I'm drunk on love, I'm stoned on you
I'm wasted, your face is
Everywhere I turn

Aaron Neville,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1988
Aaron Neville,"Ran away from home when I was seventeen
To be with you
On the California coast

Drinking margaritas all night in the old cantina
Out on the California coast

Don't think that I'm ungrateful
And don't look so morose

Adios

We never really made it baby
But we came pretty close
Adios adios

Going up north where the hills are winter green
I have to leave you
On the California coast

Going where the water's clear and the air is cleaner
Than the California coast

Our dreams of endless summer
Were just too grandiose

But I miss you the most

Was it really me talking to your heart instead?

Aaron Neville,"Long years ago, on a deep winter night.
High in the heavens, a star shone bright.
While in the manger, a wee baby lay.
Sweetly asleep, on a bed of hay.

Jesus our lord, was that baby so small.
Lay down to sleep, in a humble stall.
Then came the star, and it stood over head.
Shedding its light, 'round his little head.

Dear baby Jesus, how tiny thou art.
I'll make a place, for thee in my heart.
And when the stars, in the heavens I see.
Ever and always, I'd think of thee...



",The Star Carol,1993
Aaron Neville,"Twas the night before Christmas all white with snow
I was lying back waiting for my baby to show
I was searching my mind for the right things to say
'cause she had to leave the very next day
When out on the driveway I heard such a clatter
I dimmed all the lights and put on Clyde Mcphatter
And she came to the doorway and she gave me a kiss
And the rest of the night went something like this

It was a night
Oh what a night it was, it really was
Such a night
The moon was bright
Oh how bright it was, it really was
Such a night
The night was alive
With the stars above
Oh when she kissed
I had to fall in love.

Oh it was a kiss
Oh what a kiss it was, it really was
Such a kiss
How she could kiss!
Oh what a kiss it was, it really was
Such a kiss
Just the thought of her lips sets me afire
I reminisce, I'm filled with desire.

And I gave my heart to her in sweet surrender 
Oh how I remember! 
I'll always remember

Oh that night
Oh what a night it was, it really was
Such a night
Came the dawn
And my heart and her love and the night were gone
But I know I'll never forget her kiss in the moonlight
Oh such a kiss
Oh such a night

And I gave my heart to her in sweet surrender 
Oh how I remember! 
I'll always remember 

Oh that night
Oh what a night it was, it really was
Such a night
Came the dawn
And my heart and her love and the night were gone
But I know I'll never forget her kiss in the moonlight
Oh such a kiss
Oh such a night

Well it's now Christmas morning and my baby's gone
So I light up the tree and turn the radio on
I sit down in my chair and let out a sigh
I sang away in a manager and angels on high
Now my family and friends will soon knock on my door
So I'll say merry Christmas to you and to yours
May your days be cheerful and your burdens be light
Oh but mostly I wish everyone such a night

Now she's gone, gone, gone
Yeah she's gone, gone, gone
And the dawn, dawn, dawn
And the night was gone
And my heart was gone
And her love was gone
And before the dawn
Oh oh oh
Such a night!",Such a Night,1993

If you'd like to take the grand tour 
Of the lonely house that once was home sweet home 
I have nothing here to sell you 
Just some things that I will tell you 
Some things I know will chill you to the bone 
Over there, sits the chair 
Where she'd bring the paper to me sit down on my knee and whisper 
""Oh, I love you"" 
But now she's gone forever 
And this old house will never 
Be the same without the love that we once knew 
Straight ahead, that's the bed, where we'd lie in love together 
And Lord knows we had a good thing going here 
See her picture on the table, don't it look like she'd be able 
Just to touch me and say ""good morning dear"" 
There's her ring, all her things, and her clothes are in the closet 
Where she left them when she tore my world apart 
As you leave you see the nursery, oh she left me without mercy

Carries me back to some place where
I thought I'd lost my way forever

Every last chance slipped through my hand
And you smiled at me and it was over

Holding you tonight
Hold on tight
I try to say it right

And I guess sometimes the words don't come
And I wish I told you how you changed my life
And saved me with your love
I hope when all is said and done
You know I owe you one

Walk me down those streets again
Stop me right at the moment when
You stood there talking to a stranger
Tell me how you looked at me
And knew the very best that I could be
How did you see this happy ending

Standing by your side
I'm still surprised
I try to say it right

But I guess sometimes the words don't come
And I wish I'd told you how you changed my life
And saved me with your love

And kept the vision in her soul

No one believed what she heard

And mercy, mercy in this world

Torn by what we've done and can't undo 
I just want to hold you, won't you let me hold you 
Like Bernadette would do

We mostly fall, we mostly run 
And every night, and then we try 
To mend the damage that we've done 
Tonight, tonight I can not rest

To think that I did not forget that child 
That song of Bernadette

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

You know a melody can move me
And when I'm feelin' blue

I want you to know I believe in your song
Rhythm and rhyme and harmony
You help me along makin' me strong

Tears I shed were tears of joy, 
I know the meaning of contentment, 
I am happy with the Lord 

Just a plain and simple chapel, 
Where all good people go to pray, 
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger, 
As I live from day to day 

I've searched, and I've searched, 
But I couldn't find 
Nowhere on earth to find peace of mind, 
Now I'm happy in the chapel, 
Where people are of one heart, 
Yes we gather in the chapel, 
Just to sing and praise the Lord 

You'll search and you'll search 
But you never find,

Yes you did,

We waved that sleepy little town good bye 
And driving off together we crossed our hearts 
Living for the promise that love would keep us honest

And every day the sun was sure to shine 
But it tried and tried

We kissed like fire in a cheap motel

And I thought I was yours and you were mine

Aaron Neville,"I saw the harbor lights
They only told me we were parting
The same old harbor lights that once brought you to me
I watched the harbor lights
How could I help if tears were starting
Goodbye to tender nights beside the silvery sea

I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me

And the heavens open up every time she smiles
And when I come to her that is where I belong
And I'm running through her like a rivers song

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And I'm coming to her when the sun goes down
Take away my troubles, take away my grief
Take away my heartaches in the night like a thief

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love

And I need her in the daytime ( I need her)
And I need her in the night ( I need her)
And I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss and hug her, kiss and hug her tight

When I'm returning from so far away
Gives me some sweet loving, brightens up my day
And it makes me righteous and it makes me whole
And it makes me mellow right down to my soul

Aaron Neville,"I've walked through this world sometimes without a friend
My life has been up and down, been close to an end
But I've been through the mill
And I've paid my dues
Walked so many miles in different peoples shoes

But I've been through the fire
And I've walked in the rain
I've felt the joy and endured the pain

Once I was a schemer
But I always was a dreamer
But it took me who I was and where I've been
To make me who I am

I've met a lot of lost souls in the bowels of hell
Traveled some crooked roads, got some stories yet to tell
I've shot up with the junkie, in piss stench halls
Broken bread with the devil, fallen on my knees to god
Some days I was blessed, some nights I was damned
But I always tried to lend a helping hand

Once I was a deceiver
Not I am a believer
But it took me who I was and where I've been
To make me who I am

Oh, I've seen the little children, all strung out on dope
No one to care about them, living without hope
But I've been lucky that I always had a song
I'll sing it with compassion, to try to right the wrong.

Once my life was wretched
But why should I regret it
Cause, it took me who I was, and where I've been
To make me who I am

This is dedicated to my friends in jail
For my brother Jake who had to ride the rail
For my friend Roonie and Melvin, who were so dear
They were so misunderstood
But I wish they were still here
To hear this song I sing from my heart
They're forever in my soul, even though we had to part

Once I was a deceiver
Not I am a believer
But it took me who I was and where I've been
To make me who I am

God said I forgive you
Wipe away the scars
Cause I know it took who you were
And where you came from
To make you who you are

Cause I know it took who you were
And where you came from
To make you what you are",...To Make Me Who I Am,1997
Aaron Neville,"The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the endless sky, my love

And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hand
Like a trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love

And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy it would fill the earth
And would last til the end of time, my love
It would last til the end of time

A southern woman, a southern woman 
Never had a chance to say goodbye 

I met her back in sixty-three, 
She was such a mystery 
She was there on Barron Street, 
Down in New Orleans 
So wild, but yet so tame, 
She could calm a hurricane 
She was only seventeen 
And Amelia was her name 

Oh when I took her for a ride, 
She got close by my side 
And when I looked into her eye, 
Amelia kept me hypnotized

Aaron Neville,"The hills were alive with wildflowers and I
Was as wild, even wilder than they
For at least I could run
They just died in the sun
And I refused to just wither in place
Just a wild mountain rose
Needing freedom to grow
So I ran fearing not where I'd go

When a flower grows wild
It can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow

And the flowers I knew
In the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close
I had no room for growth
And I wanted so much to branch out
So I uprooted myself from home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road

When a flower grows wild
It can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow

I grew up fast and wild
And I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged
I just longed to be gone
So the garden one day set me free
I hitched a ride with the wind
And since he was my friend
I just let him decide where we'd go

When a flower grows wild
It can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow

Just a wild rambling rose seeking mysteries untold
No regret for the path that I chose
When a flower grows wild
It can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow",Wild Flower,1999
Aaron Neville,"I traveled the banks of the River of Jordan
To find where it flows to the sea.
I looked in the eyes of the cold and the hungry
And I saw I was looking at me.
I wanted to know if life had a purpose
And what it all means in the end.
In the silence I listened to voices inside me
And they told me again and again.

The is only one river. There is only one sea.
And it flows through you, and it flows through me.
There is only one people. We are one and the same.
We are all one spirit. We are all one name.
We are the father, mother, daughter and son.
From the dawn of creation, we are one.
We are one.

Every drop in the sea
Every cry of a newborn baby
Every prayer to be free
Every hope at the end of a rainbow

And that means everyone.

We are only one river. We are only one sea.
And it flows through you, and it flows through me.

They say that every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere so high above this wall

From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now

Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame
And all day long I hear him shouting so loud
Just crying out that he was framed

That's the train, my baby's on

Got a letter yesterday
This is what she had to say
Meet me at the station a quarter to ten
Let's try it over again

Waitin' at the station, happy as can be, now
Waitin' at the station for my baby
My lonely nights are over from this day on
Since my baby's coming back home

The train pulled in a few minutes late
But I didn't mind that little wait
That train is carrying medicine for heartaches and pain
For this lonely man

Everybody's gettin' off one by one
Tellin' their friend where they've been and what they've done
But where is my girl, everybody's off the train
She made a fool of me again

Waitin' at the station sad as can be, now
Waitin' at the station for my baby, now

Aaron Neville,"I've walked through this world sometimes without a friend
My life has been up and down, been close to an end
But I've been through the mill
And I've paid my dues
Walked so many miles in different peoples shoes

But I've been through the fire
And I've walked in the rain
I've felt the joy and endured the pain

Once I was a schemer
But I always was a dreamer
But it took me who I was and where I've been
To make me who I am

I've met a lot of lost souls in the bowels of hell
Traveled some crooked roads, got some stories yet to tell
I've shot up with the junkie, in piss stench halls
Broken bread with the devil, fallen on my knees to god
Some days I was blessed, some nights I was damned
But I always tried to lend a helping hand

Once I was a deceiver
Not I am a believer
But it took me who I was and where I've been
To make me who I am

Oh, I've seen the little children, all strung out on dope
No one to care about them, living without hope
But I've been lucky that I always had a song
I'll sing it with compassion, to try to right the wrong.

Once my life was wretched
But why should I regret it
'cause, it took me who I was, and where I've been
To make me who I am

Speech:
This is dedicated to my friends in jail
For my brother jake who had to ride the rail
For my friend roonie and melvin, who were so dear
They were so misunderstood
But I wish they were still here
To hear this song I sing from my heart
They're forever in my soul, even though we had to part

Once I was a deceiver
Not I am a believer
But it took me who I was and where I've been
To make me who I am

God said I forgive you
Wipe away the scars
Cause I know it took who you were
And where you came from
To make you who you are

(One question, what was her name) 
Mona Lisa, you called my name
Laid it apart but I did not respond 
And you ask me what I am thinking of 
In the morning I'll be gone, no more loving after dawn
No longer can we share the love that was never there
When the moon has lost its light
And the stars no longer bright 
And no longer can we share, the love that was never there
(Ain't no need to cry girl, its gonna be alright) 

Girl don't you cry
(Girl don't you cry) 
Please dry your eyes

This he said to me

Is just to love and be loved in return""

Such a sky you never did see
Who will tie it up with a ribbon?

So I could see it at my leisure
Whenever things go wrong
And keep it as a treasure
To last my whole life long

Who will buy this wonderful feeling?
I'm so high I swear I could fly
Me oh my, I don't want to lose it
So what am I to do to keep this sky so blue?
There must be someone who will buy

Who will buy this wonderful morning...?

There'll never be a day so sunny
It could not happen twice
Where is the man with all the money?
It's cheap at half the price

All the broken hearted may they find a way to heal

And all the homeless and the needy
That they might have a coat to wear

From my little house upon Valance Street
I'm sending out these hopes to high above
That this whole earth just might someday be
A little better place for the human race

From Lafayette to London
From Buenos Aires to Beijing
Let's be kind to one another
And let that yuletide spirit ring

Spread the message and the meaning
Of the season everywhere

That this whole earth just might someday be
A little better place for the human race

This is my wish, it may be a lot to ask
But I'm hoping that a miracle
Will finally come to pass

Are just whispers in the air

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! 

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind has bought.

Help to make the season bright. 
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow, 
Will find it hard to sleep tonight. 

They know that Santa's on his way; 
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh. 
And every mother's child is going to spy, 
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

Go, tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, tell it on the mountain,
That Jesus Christ is born. 
While shepherds kept their watching
Over silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light.

The shepherds feared and trembled,
When lo! above the earth,
Rang out the angels chorus
That hailed the Savior's birth.

[Chorus]

And lo! When they had heard it,
They all bowed down to pray,
Then traveled on together,
To where the Baby lay.

Down in a lowly manger
The humble Christ was born
And God sent us salvation
That blessed Christmas morn.

My flock of days to guard,
Each day finds time for praying,
From this I won't retard.

Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing

Why do lies make my love stronger

Round the campfire light
A lovely woman in motion
With hair as dark as night
Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark
That hypnotized me with love

She was a gypsy woman
She was a gypsy woman

She danced around and round
To a guitar melody
From the fire her face was aglow
How she enchanted me
Oh how I'd like to hold her near
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

I love you gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman

All through the caravan
She was dancing with all the men
Waiting for the rising sun
Everyone was having fun
I hate to see the lady go
Knowing she will never know
That I love her
That I love her

Well that's how it is when it's over and done

All bets are off and we both go runnin' for cover

Gets kinda messy in the aftermath of a meltdown

You can doctor the spin when you tell all your friends

But you can't say that I didn't love you

Does it make me a jerk 'cause it just didn't work

There were some things we could not overcome

But love or the lack of it never was one

You can put a new face on that old twist of fate

But deep down inside you can't say that I didn't love you


Now It's only normal to criticize

How it all went down 'cause the tension's running high

And we say things, that we don't mean

But that doesn't change last summer and fall

If that wasn't love then what do you call, September

Do you remember?

But you can't say that I didn't love you

But love or the lack of it never was one

I was thinking ?bout the perfect words

To say to that living doll

By the time that I had worked it out

She was half way down the hall


My schoolboy fears of being shot down

Kept that dream from getting off the ground

Lookin back I figured out I thought about it too long


Sometimes you just gotta jump in, get yourself movin?

Countdown the clock is runnin

Sometimes there?s no time to doubt it, just gotta do it

Don?t even think about it


So, baby if it seems I?m coming on too strong

It?s just that I don?t want to feel this feeling gone

'cause in this moment there could be a golden opportunity

To tell you what you mean to me

Don?t want to think about it too long

Aaron Pritchett,"You know I need your love, you got that hold over me
Long as I got your love, you know that I?ll never leave
When I wanted you to share my life, I had no doubt in my mind
And it?s been you, woman, right down the line

I know how much I lean on you, only you can see
The changes that I've been through have left their mark on me
You've been as constant as the northern star
The brightest light that shines
It?s been you, woman, right down the line

I just wanna say this is my way
Of telling you everything I could never say before
Yeah, this is my way of telling you that everyday
I'm loving you so much more

?Cause you believed in me through my darkest night
Put something better inside of me, you brought me into the light
Threw away all those crazy dreams, I put them all behind
And it was you, woman, right down the line

I just wanna say this is my way
Of telling you everything I could never say before
Yeah, this is my way of telling you that everyday
I'm loving you so much more

If I should doubt myself if I'm losing ground
I won't turn to someone else, they'd only let me down

And it?s been you, woman, right down the line",Right Down the Line,2003
Aaron Pritchett,"

my jaw hit the floor the day you walked in

all eyes were pointed in your direction

with nothing to lose I asked you to dance

I didn't think that I'd stand a chance but


Chorus:

lucky for me you proved me wrong

(proved me wrong)

it was a roll of the dice

it was a shot so long

what started out as no hope in hell

has turned out heavenly

so lucky for me


Just goes to show you can't judge a book by the cover

if I had I'd still be searching for another

I believed I was livin in a dream

and at any moment someone would wake me up but,

And channel surf my life away
Gonna grab my keys, 
Get behind the wheel
Got no where to go, 
Just like the way it feels

'cause life is short 
And the road is long
I'll be punchin' dials
Lookin' for a drivin' song

Ain't gonna stop for nothing
But a tank of gas
Take an old black road
That ain't on the map
Gotta little hula dancer
Bobbin' in my back window
She's gonna stick with me
Wherever I go

And the miles fly by
Got all I need to clear my mind

Turn My headlights off 
And crank the tunes
The only light that I need
Is that big full moon
And I know that soon
This night will end
We'll have to head back home

Aaron Pritchett,"Lonely's To The Bone

I took her keys, she took a cab 
She made sure the front door slammed 
Between the rain and the whiskey the whole thing was still a blur 

She caught a plane to San Antone 
I got that far then the trail went cold 
Since then I haven?t heard a single word from her 
Then I found out that 

All I?ve lost is all I want 
And all I?ll ever need 
And I realize the deepest cut 
Can take a while to bleed 
'cause suddenly it hit me that 
She left me all alone 
And leaving?s only skin deep 
But lonely?s to the bone 

The phone would ring once or twice 
It?d be some number I don?t recognize 
But nobody?s ever home when I call it back 

Door?s unlocked, coffee?s on 
The fire?s burnin? but she still ain?t home 
Don?t know if I?ll ever learn to live with that 
And I found out that 

CHORUS 

Oh, it would be so easy if 
Her memory?d just move on 
And leaving?s only skin deep 
But lonely?s to the bone

Looking for some brand new strings

And could I stay here for a while

I'm looking for a warm safe place
To feel your hand on my face
Let the past roll off of my back
Baby let's not talk about that
I just wanna make it through the night
Lock the door and hide away

I'm too damn old to weather this wind
The rain it just won't stop it seems
And I'm too stubborn to quit these dreams

I can finally find some peace with you
Won't you lay down next to me

Starin' down to the bottom of Mountain Top road, 
Hands wrapped tight around those plastic handle grips 
I took off flying pickin' up speed 
The world was a blur of rocks and weeds 
It was all worth the pain of landing 
Getting my first three stitches 
Everyone said that I shouldn't do it 
Cut and bruised but I got through it 
I still got the scars to prove it

Time runs away, every day I'm learning 
To roll with the punches, follow my hunches 
Loving the way it feels 
Just to be alive 
Getting the chance to ride on the big wheel 

I'm takin my share of dead end curves 
Had to steady my nerves and steal my courage 
Had a lot of hard landings but I ain't hanging up my wings 
Yeah I'm still rippin' down that hill 
Still hanging on with all my will 
Lookin' back now I still 
Wouldn't change a thing

I've broken my pride and I've broken my heart 
But I'm gonna live my life before it all goes dark

But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind

But when I got down to number six I realized we were through

The dog's at the vet the hearing is set
Do you see what I'm trying to say
Don't forget to take out the trash, I'm sorry but I'm not coming back
Now you can't sugar coat what she really wrote
Ain't that a hell of a note

I just stood there and scratched my head, my chin dropped to the floor
Not even a tear after all these years, I expected a little bit more
I was countin' on grabbin' a good, cold beer
Stretchin' out on the couch
But she went by the numbers and I got counted out

As I ask myself with every step will I ever be alone

Is there no place I go that you don't come too

When I left Tennessee, I thought we were through
Now I wonder how far it is over you

I was deep in California when I finally made a friend
And it was me and that old hobo till you showed up again
Then he ran out of liquor and I've run out of time
I'm standing by the ocean, but you're still on my mind
And I'm staring at the water so blue and deep and wide
Bet a man could lose a memory over on the other side

I've never been up against anything quite like you
There have been tight situations but baby this is close
You're so soft to touch and you're so easy to hold
For the first time in my life I feel like I just can't lose

Sometimes I drank more that I ate
I used to think, man, I was bad

I guess I'm lucky that I survived
I had some days I can't forget
And sometimes at night I think about 'em yet

Yeah, I miss misbehavin'
I've settled down now

There was a girl I do recall
She was as tough as she was tall
We used to dance to every song
Lord, we held each other all night long

She used to call me her honey baby
I called her my miss misbehavin'

Lord, I've paid some pretty prices for never backing up

There's only one part of my story that I wish that I could change

If I had it to do over and I knew then what I know now
I'd do anything I had to, to keep you from walkin' out
Your love would be the only reason for anything that I'd undo
Yes, if I had it to do over, I'd do it over you

There are bridges I have burned and there are promises I've made
And the ones that I have broken I'll have to carry to my grave
And when I stand before the throne and answer for my every deed
The only one that I'll regret is what I've done to you and me

I'm a walkin,' talkin,' livin,' breathin,' portrait of my past 
I've double-crossed the devil, prayed the Lord my soul to keep 
Escaped some early graves by the skin of my teeth 
All the deepest secrets of my soul the world can plainly see 
'Cause everything I've ever done is written all over me 
If you just read between the lines of this well-weathered face of mine 
Every wrinkle, every scar was a painful work of art

And no story I can tell can tell it quite as well 
As these souvenirs that livin's left behind 
So take a long, hard look at the cover of this book 
And read between the lines 
And read between the lines 

They might be hard to find on this rigid face of stone 
There are pleasant deep impressions that are solid as gold 
And I'll be the first to tell you that this ol' boy's been blessed

You build the things that really make the world go 'round

Now I'm not sure how long her tears could last
In a stranger's arms
She's wounded I know and feeling so low
She could fall at any time
I don't know what I would do
If I were to lose that precious angel of mine

Looking for my blue angel
The same one that flew from my arms last night

Feels like Hell tonight

But I can touch your hand that's against me
And take that moment home

Aaron Tippin,"I was born on the wrong of the city
Desperation in my mother's eyes
Factory whistle would wake me in the morning
At night the sirens sang my lullaby

Fought my way out of the blue collar jungle
Heart of leather and hands of steel
Thought I was too much of a sole survivor
To ever feel the way I feel

But I don't want to live without your love
I don't want to live without your love
I can't take another night
And I've lost the will to fight

For you and you alone
You can have everything I own

To sweet, sweet loving

Marvin, he was a friend of mine
And he could sing a song
His heart in every line
Marvin sang of the joy and pain
He opened up our minds
And I still can hear him say
Aw talk to me so you can see
What's going on
Say you will sing your songs
Forevermore (evermore)

Gonna be some sweet sounds
Coming down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud
Oh I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night
It's gonna be all right
On the nightshift
Oh you found another home
I know you're not alone
On the nightshift

Jackie (Jackie), hey what'you doing now
It seems like yesterday
When we were working out
Jackie (Jackie, oh) you set
The world on fire
You came and gifted us
Your love it lifted us
Higher and higher
Keep it up and
We'll be there
At your side
Oh say you will sing
Your songs forevermore (evermore)

Gonna be some sweet sounds
Coming down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud
Oh I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night
It's gonna be all right
On the nightshift
Oh you found another home
I know you're not alone
On the nightshift

Gonna miss your sweet voice
That soulful voice
On the nightshift
We all remember you
Ooh the songs are coming through
At the end of a long day
It's gonna be okay
On the nightshift
You found another home
I know you're not alone

Aaron Tippin,"I remember I was sitting in this little cafe
Some where out in the middle of L.A.
It was almost Christmas and I was all alone

Suddenly He appeared, hungry, cold and tired
Headed straight for me, He sat down uninvited
What was on my mind when I didn't say
'Cause what He said to me, I think of every Christmas day

He said that He was Jesus born in Bethlehem
And that He died for us but somehow we'd forgotten Him
Maybe He was lying just above my father's tree
But He said that He was Jesus and I just had to believe

I sat there in stunned silence and when His eyes met mine
I just pushed my plate to Him and He said, ""You're mighty kind""
And I admit I had my doubts but I just couldn't take the chance
I know the good book says, ""You gotta help your fellow man""

And He said that He was Jesus born in Bethlehem
And that He died for us but somehow we'd forgotten Him
Maybe He was lying just above my father's tree
But He said that He was Jesus and I just had to believe

I may never know if it was Jesus in that chair
All I really know is that I'm sure that He was there

He said that He was Jesus born in Bethlehem
And that He died for us but somehow we'd forgotten Him
Maybe He was lying just above my father's tree

to cry

And poured a drink down his throat

minutes apart

On how long it takes for the begging and the pleading
To finally start soaking in

Not to stick my big foot in my big mouth

I was born by God's dear grace

Aaron Watson,"While he's out running around with the boys at the bar downtown
His sweetheart sits at home all alone and she's waiting by the telephone
But he'll spend his quarter somewhere else

Well she's done what a good girl should but she's done all she could
So she packs her bags up for the next plain going home and he's crying by the telephone
But she'll spend her quarter somewhere else

[Chorus]
And just a call to tell her that you love her
That is all she really ever wanted to hear
And it ain't asking much to tell her that you miss her
Just a call and that's all and she'd still be here

He spends a lot of time on the road breaking even with the rodeo
He knows he should call her but he's barely got enough and making ends meet is tough
So he'll spend his quarter somewhere else

Aaron Watson,"Well I was thumbing through the channels
And I saw a sight to see
A so-called country singer, there singing on MTV
And I began to think - had she ever heard a thing
Had she ever been to Texas where Bob Wills is still the king
Ah - ha

From the Houston rodeo to any old dancehall
Of cowgirls and cowboys know how to have a ball
And every night they'll tip a toast to the Lone Star state
Where the women are so fine and the music is so great
Cause I wanna two-step to a real dancehall swinger
I don't wanna see no wanna-be country western singer
Don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it

Aw yeah...

All together now....

It's a Texas thing, y'all
So if you don't understand just drop what you're doing
Drive here as quick as you can
I'd even stop in Oklahoma if it was up to me
Cause when it comes to country, there ain't none like
I wanna two-step to a real dancehall swinger
I don't wanna see no wanna-be country western singer
Don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it

That hip-hoppin' rappin' boy band crap is for the squirrels in San Francisco
And Nashville is making music that sounds like a dadgum disco
Don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it
Yes, I said don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it
That's right...

Sawin? on a fiddle and the crying of a steel guitar

Coming from the heart and soul

Born and bred in the ole Lone Star

Get them honky tonkin? blues

Let them be your saving grace

If you want to hear some country

Then you?ve come to the right place


You miss Waylon, if it don?t make you smile

Like Willie and George Jones

You better stick around a while

You like Merle, Buck and Johnny

We might just get along

But if you don?t, go slap your mommy

Cause your momma raised you wrong

I drink my coffee black, I sure like my Charlie Pride

Well I still solute ole Glory and I give glory to the lord

I tip my hat to ole E.T. and his Texas Troubadours

Never even crossed that county line

Thought she'd at least call to say that she was ok
While she left me walkin' the floor
Maybe she was long gone long before she ever set foot out that door
I guess over time the love in her heart was overshadowed by her heartaches
She didn't scream or shout, she had it all mapped out, and she never even tapped the brakes

Aaron Watson,"Is love so fragile
And the heart so hollow
Shatter with words
Impossible to follow
You're saying I'm fragile
I try not to be
I search only
For something
I can't see

I have my own life
And I am stronger
Than you know
But I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door

Lovers forever
Face to face
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me
My lace

You in the moonlight
With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave
Sometimes I'm a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by

Now you’re thinkin’ your ship is slowly sinkin’
You’re stayin’ up all night long, drownin’ in your drinkin’

Then you throw out a line, reel it back in

You know you’ll never catch a keeper
If you sit around and cry
So get back in that boat and fish

Now you heard the girl he’s kissin’ is stirrin’ up a wake
Sayin' she hooked you good and threw you right back in the lake

Aaron Watson,"There's a memory that rings clear as a bell
I was bouncin' like a bull rider on his knee
I sure miss those old stories that he'd tell
From a hobo on a freight train
To a sailor out at sea
My granny says that I've got his smile
He's the reason I take pride in my last name
No he never made the headlines
Nobody sings his song
So for every unsung hero I'm singing this today

So raise your bottle to the boys and let's remember
All the fallen and the price they had to pay
Hold 'em up high and salute all the ones that made it back
And for the ones away from home, don't forget to pray

Grandpa could sing you every Hank Williams song
But it's amazing grace that brought him back around
He'd shead a tear talkin' about the day
That German gunner shot his best friend down

My daddy fought a war some say in vain
He came home in a wheel chair, now he walks with a kane
Seems like every generation has to pay the cost
I think about my family and the good friends that we've lost

So raise your bottle to the boys and let's remember
All the fallen and the price they had to pay
Hold 'em up high and salute all the ones that made it back

Aaron Watson,"In another time and place
Grandma would kiss my face
Wish I could go back there again
I'd climb up in my grandpa's lap
I'd lay down and take a nap
That old man and me were best friends

And one day I turned around
Leaves are fallin', fallin' down
Those fields were bare and brown and they were gone

Long gone like bluebonnets in the spring
We're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet
So make the most of every mile
So pack light and love heavy
Give it all your heart and soul, so in the end
You won't regret one thing
Life is like bluebonnets in the spring.

There's so much I can't explain
Such as gravity and pain
Still I remain, blindfolded and full of faith
I kissed my angel girl goodbye
Still can't help but wonder why
But I believe I'll see her again someday

So, hold 'em tender, hold 'em tight
Pray every mornin', day, and night
That God will help you raise them right
And don't you blink, don't blink

'Cause like bluebonnets in the spring
We're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet
So make the most of every mile
So pack light and love heavy
Give it all your heart and soul
So in the end you won't regret one thing
Life is like bluebonnets in the spring

Life can be filled full of sorrow
Time is something you can't borrow
So love like there's no tomorrow
Because today could the day

Like bluebonnets in the spring
We're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet
So make the most of every mile
So pack light and love heavy
Give it all your heart and soul, so in the end

Aaron Watson,"Sunday afternoon church potluck
George Jones blaring from my grandpa's truck
Granny's fried chicken and her sweet tea
Now that's a bittersweet memory

The old tire swing where my little boys play
Well, that was me only yesterday
Doing double back flips off the branch in the tank
Kissing on you and fishing from the bank

We've had some good times, got through the bad times
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times
Strong as an oak, solid as a hickory
That's a love made in the shade of our family tree

Passed down from my granny and my grandpa
Mom and daddy kept it safe, kept it sturdy and tall
Summers were hot, winters were long
But our roots were deep and our faith was strong

Now some are gone, and some are all grown
You and me, baby, branched out on our own
With every sunset comes another sunrise
I can see my daddy in our little boys' eyes

We've had some good times, got through the bad times
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times
Strong as an oak, solid as a hickory
That's a love made in the shade of our family tree

Lost love once throughout the years
Remember their smiles and dry those tears
'Cause they'll live on in your heart and mine
So let love grow like a country vine

We've had some good times, got through the bad times
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times
Strong as an oak, solid as a hickory
That's a love made in the shade of our family tree
Made in the shade of our family tree

Aaron Watson,"Now this is a true story for the most part
That occurred on the top floor of this
Bigwig record executive's office in Nashville, Tennessee
Now understand I'm not poking any fun or disrespecting anybody
God knows I love country music with all my heart and soul
And I love the Grand Ole Opry
But I do have a problem with someone who
Can't even play a D chord on a guitar
Telling someone with a dream that they won't get far
So this song is dedicated to all those underdogs like me
Out there running around
Don't get discouraged if you have a dream
Don't be afraid to chase it down
It's how it goes

He said, ""Son, don't get offended by what I'm about to say
I can see you have a passion
For the songs you write and play
But you lack what we all call commercial appeal
And you just don't have what it takes
To make it here in Nashville""

Ouch

Well my heart felt like a train wreck
But I wore a smile on my face
I said, ""Thank you for your time, sir""
Put my guitar back in its case
Our little conversation was like a revelation
Redirecting my dreams
'Cause God knows I'd never sell my soul to rock 'n' roll
Or rap or wear those tight skinny jeans

'Cause you know I'd rather sing my own songs
Than be a puppet on a string
I'll wear what I want to wear
I'm gonna sing what I wanna sing
Heaven knows all I need
Is my faith, my fans, my friends and my family
Besides I'd rather be an old fence post in Texas
Than the king of Tennessee

So I loaded up my old pickup truck
And I drove back home to Amarillo
Got a gig off old route 66
At this ballroom called The Armadillo
And for the first thousand shows or so
Not a soul showed up
I thought about quitting every other day
But I just kept on kicking that cup

Yeah, I kept kicking that can surrounded by
Blood, sweat, and beers
And wouldn't you know I became an overnight sensation
In just over ten years
And now I'm packing out all the dance halls
And the rodeos every night
I got a pretty wife, a ranch, a band, a bus, a boat
I'd say I'm doing alright

And you know I'd rather sing my own songs
Than be a puppet on a string
I'll wear what I want to wear
I'm gonna sing what I wanna sing
Heaven knows all I need
Is my faith, my fans, my friends and my family
Besides I'd rather be an old fence post in Texas
Than the king of Tennessee

Oh, how 'bout a little front porch picking, boys

Well, wouldn't you know that old record man
Showed up one night at this honky tonking bar
After my show he said,
""Son, I believe you might be the next big country star""
He said, ""We like how you keep it raw
We like how you keeping it real
And I think you may just have what
We all like to call commercial appeal""
Huh, ain't that something
Well, sir

I'd rather sing my own songs
Than be a puppet on a string
I'll wear what I want to wear
And I'm gonna sing what I wanna sing
Heaven knows all I need
Is my faith, my fans, my friends and my family
Besides I'd rather be an old fence post in Texas
Than the king of Tennessee

Right on track I'm chugging along.

On a wing and a prayer in a glorified greyhound bus,
Flying down the road running 9-0 and kicking up dust.

Smell the smoke stack, hear the gears grind
Full steam ahead halfway out of my mind

I wish you wouldn't smile at me that way

Aaron Watson,"He wanted someone who loves the land as much as he does
Someone who knows the blessin' of a good hard rain
Somebody simple and strong that he knows he can count on
Soft as the wind, you're bold enough to bless his name

That's why God loves cowboys
I believe there's a place in his heart

The fences needs mendin'
He knows they'll work hard
On his great big ranch called life
'Cause they love and take care of all it's creations

To those broken hardened honky tonk angels
Ooh that's why God loves cowboys

He knew they'd need room to breathe and freedom
So he gave em' Texas and those big Montana skies
He was there when he heard those prayers
Coming from shying
Right beside that young man on his last ride

That's why God loves cowboys

He needs more than just a good fire keeping him warm
Ooh there's nothing more holy
Than a love of a woman weather life storm

Aaron Watson,"Don't you ever let this world push you around
Use your head and keep your feet firmly on the ground
And if you get knocked down
Get back up and try again

And don't you ever lose that sparkle in your eyes
Don't bottle up your passion like a jar fireflies
If you ever lose sight of your light
And you feel like givin' in

Don't you forget your faith in God above
Don't you forget your mom and daddy's love
When you fear, when you fail
When you feel you're gonna fall
Follow your heart and always believe in the underdog

Don't buy a thing unless you can pay in cash
Go ahead and throw those credit cards in the trash
Love is a virtue, honesty is the key
Say your prayers, brush your teeth
Don't you watch too much TV

If you're down in the count one strike away
Choke up and crowd the plate, put the ball in play
Keep your nose down when you win
Keep your head up when you lose
And you're gonna lose

But don't you forget your faith in God above
Don't you forget your mom and daddy's love
When you fear, when you fail
When you feel you're gonna fall
Follow your heart and always believe in the underdog

And there will come a day
When I will fly away, so make me smile
While we're apart
You gotta sing from you soul and play with all of your heart

There's a good chance your heart will break in two
Trust that God has someone special planned for you
Did you know I was down on love and luck
When he sent your mom to me?

Someday you'll have babies of your own
So cherish every moment
You're gonna blink and they'll be grown
The greatest honor that I've ever had
Is having you call me your dad

Boys, don't you forget your faith in God above
Don't you forget your mom and daddy's love
When you fear, when you fail
When you feel you're gonna fall
Follow your heart and always believe in the underdog

When you fear, when you fail
When you feel you're gonna fall
Follow your heart and always believe in the underdog",The Underdog,2015

Stay razor sharp, find your mark

Always dancing in the dark, 
When the shadows of the night shoot out the lights, I know you'll be the spark

follow your arrow, 
You will pray to never stray from straight and narrow, 
Be steadfast and steady, 
always be ready, 
Aim for the stars in the sky, 
take heart, pull it back and let it fly 

Good things come to those who pray so don't you chalk it up a chance, 
And never let your arrow be led by arrogance,
Fill your quiver full of courage,
Show this world your heaven sent 
Keep a good head on your shoulders

Yeah these old boots have roots
They haul a heavy load, down a long and winding road
Yeah these old boots have roots
Strong as a live oak tree, someday you can bury me in
These old boots

So I march to the beat of my heart pounding like a drum
Let 'em run me down, but I'll stand my ground
No I won't forsake or forget where I come from
I swear I'll never break your heart, only wanna make you smile
These old boots want nothing more than to walk you down the aisle
I'll never bend for a dream, God knows I'll never trade them in
For some shallow hearted soul bouncing back and forth again

Aaron Watson,"Bluebonnets down a long stretch of hill country highway
Windows down, radio up, ride shotgun next to you
You were smoking Camel Lights behind the wheel I can still hear you say
Three hundred thousand miles you can't beat an ol' beat up Chevrolet

Well Granny's in the kitchen, smell of fried chicken frying
She's cooking in her apron singing along with Patsy Cline
Playing ball in the front yard, little sister runs in crying
She climbs up in her arms, I hear her laughing through the old screen door

They don't make 'em like you anymore

Well the days have changed since the golden days in some ways we've come so far
But I never dreamed we'd trade the American Dream for a fancy foreign car
Have we sold our souls to save a buck traded hard work for dumb luck

You'll always be there in their hearts and your love light will shine on
And someday they'll sit around down at John T's Country Store
They'll be laughing over stories you told a thousand times before, saying

Well no news is good news, tell me whose news really tells the truth
The death toll rises high as gas prices shoot straight through the roof
Meanwhile politicians preach while some preachers politic
Well we need is lots of love, yeah lots of love might do the trick

Instead we criticize, we glamorize who's right or wrong, who's left or right
Missing out on so many beautiful colors fighting over what's black and white
We've gotta forgive, gotta learn to live together, make the world a better place
And just maybe someday somebody somewhere will look back on today

Don't argue with a woman while she's holdin' a gun
Never cheat when it comes to love or dominoes

Well my heart sank the more he drank, the more he poured out his misery
How he lost her after forty-seven years and his tears started flowing like the Rio Grande
He started speakin' in Spanish, then he kissed is rosary
Said ""por siempre mi amor"" his one more to her memory

He said don't live your life like a sad country song

I walked over to the corner, turned the old jukebox on
When I turned back around, like a ghost he was gone

So I paid his tab, called a cab, called it a night, and came straight home to you
As we laid there in bed, I told you all the things he said
we laughed, we cried, and I held you the whole night through

You know I think of him often, out there all alone
Maybe he was an angel, or just an old man from San Antone

Que el querer esta amarrado al sufrir
Y el sufrir envuelto en la soledad

Porque alguna vez 
Te darás cuenta que amaste de verdad
Y tarde será 
Porque si tu te vas yo no te esperaré
Si me dolerá
Pero no he de esperar que tu quieras volver

I know the past comes back to haunt you 
There are satellites in heaven 
Watching everything you do 

This is a battle that you're losing 
And life was never more confusing 
Now you're looking for a way out 
Of your accidental life 

[Chorus]
But now your life is on the line 
You can stay inside but you're out of time 

You can't reason in your condition 
And now you see life as a mission 
Maybe I know what your missing 
Tell me what you're going through 

All your problems are distractions 
Still waiting for the main attraction 
And you're looking for a way out 
Of your accidental life

AB,"[Chorus]
All I want to do is ride around shining while I can afford it
Plenty ice on my neck so I don't get nauseous
Float around in the greatest of Porsche's
Feel like a chuck wagon cause I'm on twelve horses
And the three behind mine they be the click
So much ice in they Rollies, the shit don't tick man
Winter through the summer (what) care less what it cost me
While I'm shoveling the snow man call me frosty lover

This for the 100,000 dollar kitty German drivers
With big rims and low-pro tires
Fuckin' with college bitches with innocent looks like Mya
Corrupt they mind, turn 'em to liars
I groom 'em well
Dior whore, Christian Lacroix
Keep guns stashed under the floor board
Enough to start world war
Paradise in reaches, home next to beaches
Hair pressed, blowin' in the wind, shit 'bout long as Jesus
I still leave speech for Gospel, so match this
Pusha push Don P keys with these sounds of crackness
The black Martha Stuart, let me show you how to do it
Break down pies to pieces, make cocaine quiches
Money piles high as my nieces
Hefty bags full of cash, cars full of ass
Rolex presidential, bitch, feel the glass

It's that luck that astounds
Life's a circus
I parade the sick through these clowns
The crown is vacant
I'm takin' the proper steps
I'm takin' them poppa steps
They prayin' for my downfall
Is it the bling, the king, conquistador
That my jeweler made the face blush on the Frank Mueller
The R shape peculiar, it's awesome, layin' over dark skin
Lookin' like arson when I park in the left, it's constant
Minute hand is like Parkinson's
You a fish for the sharks to swim
In that opaque linen with the R colored stitchin'
V12 on a Modena you can see the pistons
H-R-E's on it, Mommy see it glisten
When I make ""Oliver Twist"" like Dickens
It's feelin' like parts is missin'
Tops don't push soul
Got it drive it like pole positions 'til my soul's risen

Welcome to the world of Rollies
VS diamonds and that 50,000 dollar show piece
Got me shinin'

Let that 9mm turn a fella ghostly
Hell, I'll even grant amnesty to those who owe me
You fuckin' fagot
You need to raise your glass and toast me
Niggas can't figure the format for hustler criteria
Not chrome, grown rims with stallion insignia
Listen youngin', you've only just begun
You'll understand when you're older
Said father to the son
Who would've thought such riches stem from ill rhymes?
Canary yellow diamonds size of yield signs, slow down

Light up ya world, 'til you start to stagger and shit
Watch how them hollows straight rattle ya shit

Traits of a blow dealer, cost my fame
I hustle, I'm rich, blow scrilla
I'm the torch that, carry the game
The flame I throw, crack change came from blow
Push the o's, six lay close
Hug the streets, I hug the beat, change flows
Thug the streets, my love is deep, my pain shows

Three guns is fortune, and I don't mind sharing my wealth
Dog, I know about life
I been around the world thrice times, I mean what I say
From that panama sun, to france's champs-élysées
Grind so deep-rooted, I can't turn away
To sell base is now somewhat therapeutic

I held my own, ever since I held that zone

Been realer, pound sign, been trilla
All killer, no filler, been iller
Fraud niggas you zoolander, Ben Stiller

When it comes to shooters my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes
35 hundred, just point and give them a name
They back flipping niggas, that go for rappers the same
You don't know me nigga, fuck out my way

Between renter and a homeowner
Hip Hop, we can cover any rolling stoner
Louboutins I heist nigga, or that bitch Winona
Stop comparing me to rappers cause they in their moment
Might of crossed the name brand every blue
But these brand names to a brand owner isn't new
Don't make us equal cause we shared a bitch or two
She ain't the angel that you think, she reincarnated too
I build mine off fed time and dope lines
You caught steam off headlines and co-signs
Young niggas cliquing up with my rivals
Like the bible don't burn like these bullets don't spiral
Like I can't see the scene that you mirror in your idol
But a pawn’s only purpose is completely suicidal
Oh, suicide, it's a suicide
I'm just talking to the world like it's you and I

When it comes to shooters my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes
35 hundred, just point and give them a name
They back flipping niggas, that go for rappers the same
You don't know me nigga, fuck out my way

Nothing but cash here, this sweater is cashmere
The roof is a translucent, it's nothing but glass there
The car is a concept, what's next is my last year
My future is bright hot, you never can last here
I'm top 5, listen, who hot in the past year?
Five heartbeats and I'm feeling like Flash here
Cause what I captured is the beast unleashed in the pasture
Story of the sheep and the wolves I un-master
Fifty in the liquor, unwrapped 'em
Unpacked, powder rise and it fall like Sebastian
Telfair, tailor-made suits hand crafted
Over Bottega Veneta, high tops unfastened
S550 drop top is unimaginable
To my hand drop and then he unattached it
Practice it, nigga brick, break down, break dance
Crab walk, back spin, tanner than my black skin

When it comes to shooters my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes
35 hundred, just point and give them a name
They back flipping niggas, that go for rappers the same
You don't know me nigga, fuck out my way",Suicide,2013

Strip it down nigga, Jim Joe
I build it better nigga ten fold
La Ferrari from the Enzo
The stencil inspired by Kenzo
The roof is like Ghostface, can it be so simple
40 keys in a rental
My dogs bring it back, now you name a better kennel
I keep cash, case Feds connect me
Case kids kidnap me, kids can get back me
Not concerned with your rap beef
Poetic justice watching you sock puppets
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it
Thou shalt not covet what thou cannot budget 
I bury 2 mil in the Caymans they can’t touch it

Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it

Trap phone, gun at your backbone
Graduated from the corner where the crack’s thrown
Back talk to your momma now you act grown
Listening to Young Dolph till the pack gone
I relate to ‘em
I’m a Pyrex God, shit I’m great to ‘em
All of you lil’ niggas quote all of the wrong figures
Poke all of the wrong bitches
And follow the wrong niggas
Whichever rapper hot at the moment
Don’t realize he a candle till he blow it
I gave y’all the game it’s decoded
The only thing left is to grow it
Drop a shoe, start a Play Cloths or two
It’s all hustlin’, so deja vu
Still a nigga unwrap bricks
I’ma dye on that money like a bank got hit sniff

Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it

Game too emo, I’m too Nino
Must stay low-key, I play Reno
I’m so Pesci, too Casino 
We Sinatra, Sammy, Dinos
Outlandish, so illegal
So Carlito, so Pacino
We sip vino, the grapes of wrath
Money counter go till it breaks in half
Coupes the flagship, it feels like futon
Palm the paddle shift, abuse the redline
The home is ranch style, reflects the poolside
Powder paved the way, the sword got two sides
Duffle a hundred bands, trunk is 2-5
Mules are flying in, the drive from Tucson
The dash is hollowed out, we shortened the fuel line
Connect is in Panama, in bed with the cruise lines

Watch out - watch out - watch out - watch out

Here we go back to a groove, back and forth to make you move
Get up to the funky music on the dance floor and just swing it
Tonight's the night for you to let it hang out
You get funky while I get the house
Now I know that you got soul, there it is, put the ace in the hole
Feel the vibe while the rhythm control you, I command you to get loose
Yeah, I know you like my style, grab a girl and get buck wild
Show me what you got while the noise is pumpin'
The DJ's spinnin', the crowd is jumpin'
Turn up the music and let's motivate
Do that thing until your body starts to break

Watch out - watch out - watch out - watch out
I won't give it up, baby till you drop
Get down on the bea-eat (feel the pump from the hitman)

Dance all ni-i-i-ight, dance all ni-ight

Watch out - watch out - watch out - watch out

But don't rush too fast, you might miss the last step
To a dance concept, k-swing, I drop the power
That'll keep you rockin' after hours
Come on y'all, let's turn it up a notch
The bass will vibrate, the dance floor will jump
Up and down when the people start to yell
Yeah, no time to chill, dance all night 'cause you gotta be strong
There it is, you gotta move on, shake and bake your moneymaker
And let me take you to a style
That'll make you get down, get down, to a dope sound

AB Luva,"[Chorus]
All I want to do is ride around shining while I can afford it
Plenty ice on my neck so I don't get nauseous
Float around in the greatest of Porsche's
Feel like a chuck wagon cause I'm on twelve horses
And the three behind mine they be the click
So much ice in they Rollies, the shit don't tick man
Winter through the summer (what) care less what it cost me
While I'm shoveling the snow man call me frosty lover

This for the 100,000 dollar kitty German drivers
With big rims and low-pro tires
Fuckin' with college bitches with innocent looks like Mya
Corrupt they mind, turn 'em to liars
I groom 'em well
Dior whore, Christian Lacroix
Keep guns stashed under the floor board
Enough to start world war
Paradise in reaches, home next to beaches
Hair pressed, blowin' in the wind, shit 'bout long as Jesus
I still leave speech for Gospel, so match this
Pusha push Don P keys with these sounds of crackness
The black Martha Stuart, let me show you how to do it
Break down pies to pieces, make cocaine quiches
Money piles high as my nieces
Hefty bags full of cash, cars full of ass
Rolex presidential, bitch, feel the glass

[Chorus]

It's that luck that astounds
Life's a circus
I parade the sick through these clowns
The crown is vacant
I'm takin' the proper steps
I'm takin' them poppa steps
They prayin' for my downfall
Is it the bling, the king, conquistador
That my jeweler made the face blush on the Frank Mueller
The R shape peculiar, it's awesome, layin' over dark skin
Lookin' like arson when I park in the left, it's constant
Minute hand is like Parkinson's
You a fish for the sharks to swim
In that opaque linen with the R colored stitchin'
V12 on a Modena you can see the pistons
H-R-E's on it, Mommy see it glisten
When I make ""Oliver Twist"" like Dickens
It's feelin' like parts is missin'
Tops don't push soul
Got it drive it like pole positions 'til my soul's risen

[Chorus]

Welcome to the world of Rollies
VS diamonds and that 50,000 dollar show piece
Got me shinin'
First nigga holla show me
Let that 9mm turn a fella ghostly
Hell, I'll even grant amnesty to those who owe me
You fuckin' fagot
You need to raise your glass and toast me
Niggas can't figure the format for hustler criteria
Not chrome, grown rims with stallion insignia
Listen youngin', you've only just begun
You'll understand when you're older
Said father to the son
Who would've thought such riches stem from ill rhymes?
Canary yellow diamonds size of yield signs, slow down
And proceed with caution
Carousal of horses with dual-exhaustion
Fess up, youngin' you'll always be next up
Go against I, forever play catch up nigga

Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
