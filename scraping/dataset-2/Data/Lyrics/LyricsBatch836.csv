Pere Ubu,"I spent the day under the water, today.
I was a big pink ball at the bottom of the sea,
The broad green sea.

The fish came and looked at me,
Looked at me at the bottom of the sea.
There I was for all the fish to see,
Sitting on the yellow sand at the bottom of the sea,
The broad green sea.

The sea is a big, green lens.
The birds looked down at me,
Sitting on the sand at the bottom of the sea,
The broad green sea.
And the waves rolled in,
The waves rolled in,
And I rolled in.
The waves rolled out,
And the waves rolled out.
The waves rolled out and I rolled out.
Back & forth,
And back & forth at the bottom of the sea,
The broad green sea.

I spent the day under the water.
I spent the night on the beach.
I was beached.
Beached!
Then I got bleached.
Bleached!
Washed up.
Bleached white as a bone.

So, that's my story.

And I ripped everything out.

It had the sound of the winter wind.
It had the sound of the frozen lake.

I tore myself up.
(I'm a big success.)
I could not feel.
(I do a good job.)

Dumb luck.

It works out that way.

I heard the voice of reason.

Pere Ubu,"There's a diner out on route three twenty two
Western pennsylvania

I spent my life there one afternoon
I can't get that stretch of road
Out of my head

I hear it when I
Take a shower
Reading the paper
I'd look up and see it
Across the valley

They tore down the starlight
And down at the end of the road
Built a big day's inn
Blocks the view

But I know that road's still there
I can feel it wherever I go
Whatever I'm doing
It knows that I'm still here
And it's waitin'

We are abandoned
Lies own the word
All the pictures and
All the museums
In the world
Are just a sham
Peeking played
By the clever people
Who broke the rules

Reality is defined by the needs of the
Media
History is rewritten
Faster than it can happen
Culture's a weapon
That's used against us
Culture's a swamp
And a superstition
Ignorance and abuse

Geography is a language
That can't screw up
Land
And what we add to it
Cannot lie
It's also like a mirror
In which we see ourselves
Or choose to turn away

Watch it now
Watch it
Watch it",Woolie Bullie,1998

No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring

Hey, Venus, oh, Venus
Venus, if you will
Please send a little girl for me to thrill
A girl who wants my kisses and my arms
A girl with all the charms of you
 
Venus, make her fair
A lovely girl with sunlight in her hair
And take the brightest stars up in the skies 
And place them in her eyes for me
 
Venus, goddess of love that you are
Surely the things I ask
Can't be too great a task
 
Venus, if you do
I promise that I always will be true
I'll give her all the love I have to give
As long as we both shall live

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Ando silbando me paro con la gente a charlar
Me tomo algo, sonrío y me lo vuelvo a tomar
Escucho música y me pongo a bailar
Sigo flipando cuando veo mi cara en el as
Últimamente las cosas cambian cada vez más
A veces pienso que algo malo viene detrás

Me cuelgo de cualquiera que le guste trasnochar

Pero qué bien estoy ahora, no quiero volver a hablar

Quizá el fruto de un reventón

Un rato con la felicidad
Cantarle un blues, meterle mano

I remember the day, it was oh so sad
She was the sweetest dearest friend I ever had
She could talk to me almost anytime
And at the end of my day I felt fine
Her mother broke the news to my heart
She said they're leaving and now I'm torn all apart
I think Ill never forget that day
And for you girl this is all I have to say

Ooh la la, ooh la la, I cant, cant get over you

I had a dream, me myself and I
You were my girl and of course I was your guy
We were together forever in love for life
And now it don't seem so very nice
Forever to me was short but sweet
You never let me down, you kept me on my feet
Now today all I have to say
Take it out girl and try to find a way

You are my everything, what a dream come true
What I feel for you is really hard to explain

At the hour of half past eight
Who should I spy but the Spanish Lady
Brushing her hair in the broad daylight
First she tossed it, then she brushed it
On her lap was a silver comb
In all my life I ne?er did see
A maid so fair since I did roam

Catching a moth in a golden net
When she saw me, then she fled me
Lifting her petticoat over her knee

Devolve a luz do meu olhar
(Preciso tanto de você) preciso tanto tanto de você
Apaga tudo que passou
E volta aqui pro seu lugar
Sei precisamos conversar
Quero olhar nos olhos seus
Dizer o quanto eu te amo
E nunca mais dizer adeus

Tudo bem vai ser melhor só

Foi tão difícil ter que enxergar
Que tudo isso foi ilusão
Todo esse tempo eu perdi em vão
É difícil ter que aceitar

Se faz de bobo, não tem jeito não
Só a vida pode explicar

Que talvez a gente se encontrou na hora errada
Eu pensando em amor, você pensando à madrugada
E agora a gente não consegue dizer nada
Vim dizer adeus

Talvez a gente se perdeu pelo caminho

Stayin in the best suites for weeks
In (?) sheets, alone while you cryin at home
By the phone, hopin I'll call, everyday that I'm gone (alright)
Need connections, to make ends meet ma
In both directions, just to stay on my feet (huh)
Thinkin bout me when I got mouths to feed
A spouse and two seeds (yeah) they need me to eat (that's right)
Take out time to check myself
Thinkin it wasn't really me, silly me
No wonder you can't feel me, thinkin while I'm out I'm cheatin
Wylin out and freakin - blacks, whites and peurto ricans
While I'm hardly sleepin (me and the kids hardly eatin)
Seekin God for help 'cause we hardly speakin (that's right)

Sold shirts and socks, I even sold soap
Got too small for me, I sold my old coat (uh)
Walked in jewelry stores, and stole gold ropes (yes I did)
Look around, it's no cops, I want to shoplift
but who gon' give me a lift to go shop? (watch out!)
Get my rhyme on, clothes I tried on
and I walked out with, like the ones I got on (yeah)
Commitin crimes, fiends; I was givin 'em dimes
Under 25 and was still livin with moms
I just love the dough, I gotta get plenty (yo)
Used to trick with strippers with counterfeit twenties (whassup)
The streets that kept me hungry and left me bummy
I sold candy for my school and kept the money (alright)
In stolen cars I'm gettin chased -- I had to chill 'cause

Call another chick over, kick the other chick out

They wanted to hang around me, like one of my belts (alright)
But I kept it movin, city to city, kitty to kitty
Throughout the states I was fifty for fifty
Get it with force, she fine; she could get it of course (alright)
Niggaz are warned, she married; she could get a divorce
Stayed up the rest of the night, right after the fight
Went from room to room, I was boom boom boom (room to room)
Fulfill ya fantasies with Roy Jones Jr. (what)
Girlfriend or wife, ya better hold on to her (uh)
A man's gotta do what he's got to do
She's in my hotel room - why she not with you? (alright)
It's like three in the mornin, she just stoppin through
As she walks in, her trenchcoat was droppin too
Light-skinned, long hair, yeah I popped her too
Yo I'll send her to ya room soon as Hahz get through

Or throw me on the tracks where the steel can kill me quick
The sound of emergency is stapling a fright upon their ears
I'm feeling surrounded
I'm feeling the slap of a thousand shit-brains
Behold my dark intensions rising from below

Beauty, disgusting, blood
Fatal wounds of the last emotion
Beauty, disgusting, blood
All will pay the price, yeah

Now is the time that we separate our realities
Stopping a heart that beats inside the meddling
Correcting moments lost by living in the here and now
You're on the fucking block

Tell me any way I can relate now
Before the generation dies
Time keeps moving faster and faster
And I can take the full step
Killing the generation

Beauty, disgusting, blood
Fatal wounds of the last emotion
Beauty, disgusting, blood
All will pay the price

Get off the fucking building
I'll send em' sinking into the fires of fate
Every word is like a shotgun shell so burn inside my hell
I'll drown before the fucking ship hits the ocean floor and thank god I'm not alive
To see the slack-jawed generation spread it's fucking seed

Tell me any way I can relate now
Before the generation dies
Time keeps moving faster and faster
And I can take the full step
Killing the generation

Pouring sludge into the mouth they feed
They feed and I can't stand the stench of it
I didn't see the first and I sure won't see the last
But something has got to give
Something has got to give
Pouring sludge into the mouth they feed

Perla,"Can you hear the drums Fernando
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando

Perla Batalla,"Suzanne takes you down
To her place near the river
You can see the boats go by
And you can spend the night forever

And you know she's half crazy
And that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China

And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And Jesus was a sailor
When He walked upon the water
And He spent a long time watching
From a lonely wooden tower

Yes, and when He knew for certain
Only drowning men could see Him
He said, all men will be sailors then
Until the seas free them

But He, Himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken and almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with Him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
'Cause He's touched your perfect body with His mind

Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you besides the water
She is wearing rags, feathers
From Salvation Army counters

And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbor
She shows you where to look
Between the garbage and the flowers

There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever

Nothing more will ever throw me

Un 3 de Octubre de 1980 llego al mundo en el seno de una familia humilde
El chamaquito fue criado por una madre soltera
El chamaquito jamas permitió que eso se convirtiera en una dificultad papi
El chamaquito agarro lo mejor que pudo de la experiencia
Y con la música como norte
El chamaquito comprendió si misión en la vida
Que la vida a veces esta llena de depresiones tropicales
Y que never stop five and the level
Y dios no the raith papi
Ahhh

Jaja
Cuando empece en esta cuestión fue sin mirar atrás
Sin saber que el camino es duro pero hay que luchar
Con un entendimiento y mientras canto pasa el tiempo
Veo como mi carrera gira, oh que bien me siento
Ahora se, que lo que cultive ha rendido frutos
En absoluto no fue en vano como lo disfruto
Y solo es el comienzo (Colega me escuchas)
'Toy viajando el mundo entero, intenciones tengo muchas
Muchas puertas que toque, mil estudios visite
Sentía que me quitaba, pero nunca me quite
Y aquí estamos, dos seres humanos que se juntan
Dejando de que hablar, hay muchas preguntas
Gracias al señor por la fuerza que me diste
La madre que me pusiste, la familia y lo que hiciste
Contesto sus preguntas con la dura realidad

As we walked on the sand,

I could tell that the words were romantic, 
Somethin' about sharing, 
Somethin' about always . . . 

Though the years race along, 
I still think of our song on the sand, 
And I still try to search for the words 
I can barely remember, 
Though the time tumbles by, 
There is one thing that I am forever certain of, 
I hear ""la, la la la, la di da, la da da, la da dumb,"" 
And I'm young and in love . . .

Years full of tears and regret;

Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,1970

And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case let me ask you to your face
Do you think you love me?

Letting in God's Heavenly light,
Bless the hearth, ablazing there,
With smoke ascending like a prayer!

Bless the people here within,
Keep them pure and free from sin . . .

Bless us all that we may be,
Fit O Lord to dwell with thee . . .

Bless us all that one day we may dwell,
O Lord! With Thee!

Perry Como,"It was the night before Christmas
When all through the house
Not a creature was stirring
Not even a mouse

The stockings all hung
By the chimney with care
In hopes that St. Nicholas
Soon would be there

The children were nestled
All safe in their beds
While visions of sugarplums
Danced in their heads

And mom in her kerchief
And I in my cap
Had just settled down
For a long winter's nap

When out on the lawn
There arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed
To see what was the matter

Away to the window
I flew like a flash
Tore open the shutters
And threw up the sash

The moon on the breast
Of the new fallen snow
Gave the lustre of midday
To object below

When what to my wandering eyes
Should appear
But a miniature sleigh
And eight tiny reindeer

With a little ol' driver
So lively and quick
I knew in a moment
It must be St. Nick

More rapid than eagles
His courses they came
As he whistled and shouted
And called them by name

And quot, now dasher
Now dancer
Now prancer
Now vixen

On comet
On cupid
On doner
An' blitzen' and quot

To the top of the porch
To the top of the wall
Now dash away, dash away
Dash away all

As dry leaves
Before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet with an obstacle
Mount to the sky

So, up to the housetop
The courses they flew
With a sleigh full of toys
And St. Nicholas too

And then in a twinkling
I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing
Of each little hoof

As I drew in my head
And was turning around
Down the chimney St. Nicholas
Came with a bound

He was dressed all in fur
From his head to his foot
And his clothes were all tarnished
With ashes and soot

A bundle of toys
He had flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler
Just opening his pack

His eyes how they twinkled
His dimples how merry
His cheeks were like roses
His nose like a cherry

His drawl little mouth
Was drawn up like a bow
And the beard of his chin
Was a white as the snow

The stump of his pipe
He held tight in his teeth
And the smoke it encircled his head
Like a wreath

He had a broad face
And a round little belly
That shook when he laughed
Like a bowl full of jelly

He was chubby and plump
A right jolly old elf
I laughed when I saw him
In spite of myself

A wink of his eye
And a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know
I had nothing to dread

He spoke not a word
But went straight to his work
And filled all the stockings
Then turned with a jerk

An' laying a finger
Along side his nose
An' giving a nod
Up the chimney he rose

He sprang to his sleigh
To his team gave a whistle
An' away they all flew
Like the down of a thistle

But I heard him exclaim
As he drove out of sight
And quot, Happy Christmas to all
And to all a goodnight and quot

Hm
",'Twas the Night Before Christmas,1985
Perry Como,"When I was but a youngster
Christmas meant one thing,
that I'd be getting lots of toys that day

I learned a whole lot different 
when Mother sat me down 
and taught me to spell 'Christmas' this way: 
 
'see' is for the Christ child, born upon this day
'H' for herald angels in the night
'are' means our Redeemer
'I' means Israel 
'S' is for the star that shone so bright 
'T' is for three wise men, they who travelled far 
'M' is for the manger where He lay 
'A' 's for all He stands for 
'S' means Shepard's came 
 
And that's why there's a Christmas day! 
And that's why there's a Christmas day!

So I won't ever try to keep you in a jar! 
I'll just let you flip and flow and 'round, 
I'll never tie you down 'cause that's the way you are! 

Butterfly, I'll set you free, 
But once in a while, 
Please fly home to me! 

All the snow has melted from the ground, 
When you first came around and held me it was spring! 
April showers kept you here with me, 
Was it your love for me or water on your wings? 

Butterfly, I'll set you free, 
But once in a while, 
Please make love to me! 

It's a sin to catch a butterfly, 
So I'll just say good-bye and watch you fly away! 
But should you feel by the winter's chill, 
Come to my window sill I'll never make you stay!

Perry Como,"It is better to light just one little candle, 
Than to stumble in the dark! 
Better far that you light just one little candle, 
All you need's a tiny spark! 

If we'd all say a prayer that the world would be free, 
The wonderful dawn of a new day we'll see! 
And, if everyone lit just one little candle, 
What a bright world this would be! 

Let's all light one little candle, 
Why stumble on in the dark? 
When the day is dark an' dreary, 
And your way is hard to find, 
Don't let your heart be weary, 
Just keep this thought in mind! 

It is better to light just one little candle, 
Than to stumble in the dark! 
Better far that you light just one little candle, 
All you need's a tiny spark! 

If we'd all say a prayer that the world would be free, 
The wonderful dawn of a new day we'll see! 
And, if everyone lit just one little candle, 
What a bright world this would be!

That summer kind of weather
When people get together and sing

It's the time of year
The stars seem to dance with laughter
And the moon's so big and ripe
It can hardly climb

So, why don't you meander
To your best gal's veranda
And sorta, kinda, hand her the ring?

For it's the sweetheart kissin' season
And all the world's in rhyme
When it's watermelon sweet love tellin' time

This is the time to sing this kind of purdy little ditty
A walkin' along an' singin' a song and clinging to someone purdy
The type of a tune to go with the moon
That's sailin' along a way on high

After strollin' a while, for maybe a mile
Remember to stop and pop the question
If your timin' is right, your future is bright
As bright as a watermelon sky

And then when you found a bench for two
You found your cue to linger
The chance you sought to show what you bought
You happily thought to bring her

To cinch the thing, you give her the ring
You purchased from the five and dime

Take her in your arms and whisper
That you are mine all mine
And with that line to sell, I'm here to tell
That you'll do well in watermelon time

For it's the sweetheart kissin' season
And all the world's in rhyme
When it's watermelon sweet love tellin' time

What kind of lips are these, that lied with every kiss? 
That whispered empty words of love that left me alone like this?

Are the words you whispered dancing in my arms 

""Pianissimo"" means ""soft n' low""

Darling, now I know that tender glow 
Was love shining in your eyes 

And then we stole away ""pianissimo"" 
And kissed goodnight while stars danced above

She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart

She fills my heart with very special things
With angels? songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go, I'm never lonely

With her along, who could be lonely ?
I reach for her hand, it?s always there

How long does it last ?
Can love be measured by the hours in a day ?

Are always in sight,

That bloom in the night!

You'll find that it's true 
When you're in love,

With eyes like an angel's eyes! 
And a smile like a kind of pearl 
To my mind, she's my kind of girl! 

Pretty little face 
That face just knocks me off of my feet! 
Pretty little feet 
She's really sweet enough to eat! 

She looks, like an angel looks, 
She cooks like an angel cooks! 
And my mind's in a kind of whirl 
To my mind, she's my kind of girl! 

Pretty little face 
That face just knocks me off of my feet! 
Pretty little feet 
She's really sweet enough to eat! 

She looks, like an angel looks, 
She cooks like an angel cooks! 
And my mind's in a kind of whirl 
To my mind, she's my kind of girl! 

And my heart's kind of full of joy 
Because she told me 
I'm her kind of boy! 

That lady's my kind of girl!

Perry Como,"Kiss me each morning for a million years
Hold me each evening by your side
Tell me you love me, for a million years
Then if it don't work out, then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye! 
 
Sweeten my coffee with a morning kiss
Soften my dreams with a sigh
After you've loved me for a million years
Then if it don't work out, then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye! 
 
If you must go, I won't grieve
If you just wait a lifetime before you leave... 
If you must go, I won't say no
Just so we can say that we tried
Tell me you love me for a million years
Then if it don't work out, then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye! 
 
Then you can tell me goodbye...",Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye,2002
Perry Como,"And I love you so, the people ask me how
How I've lived 'till now, I tell them I don't know
I guess they understand, how lonely life has been
That, life began again the day you took my hand

And yes, I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me

And you love me too, your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free, I'm happy that you do
The book of life is brief and once a page is read
All but love is dead that is my belief

And yes, I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me",Where Is Love?,2002

if you were only mine
I know the sun would shine for me . . .
I'd find my happiness,
to be in your caress,
my every fear and every tear, I'd lose dear . . .
If you could understand,
I know you'd lend a hand,
to all the dreams I've planned for you . . .
Life would be so divine,
I'd worship at your shrine,
Sweetheart, if you were only mine!

Perry Como,"She's a Lady ~ I'm a Lady! 
She's a Lady ~ I'm a Lady! 
She's as quiet as a mouse 
Why, she would never ever raise her voice to a shout 
Not unless somebody else is drownin' me out! 

Yes, She's a Lady ~ I'm a Lady! 
High floutin' ~ You're darn tootin'! 
And her manners are superb 
Yesterday I wore a gown of satin an' lace, 
You took me out dinin' to the ritziest place 
And when they brought the finger bowl, 
Why you washed your face! 
Ah! I'm a Lady! ~ She's a Lady ~ Oh yeah! 

He's a Lover! ~ I'm a Lover! 
He's big hearted! ~ Once I've started! 
Nothin' is good for you! 
Say, how do you mean that? 
I bought you a golden necklace fit for a Queen 
If that's a golden necklace, why's my neck turnin' green? 

He's Romantic! ~ I'm Romantic! 
He's the shy type! ~ Yes, it's my type! 
He's the kind that girls can't trust! 
Some guys take a girl out ridin' an' when they do, 
She may have to walk home, that don't happen to you! 
That's because I take them riding in a canoe 
Oh! He's a lover! ~ I'm a lover ~ Oh yeah! 

She's a Lady ~ I'm a Lady! 
She's the fine type ~ Home at nine type! 
She's as gentle as a lamb! 
She's the most refined girl that the city has got 
I will beat up anyone who says that I'm not! 

She's a High-Brow ~ I'm a High-Brow! 
You're what 'class' is! ~ You need glasses! 
You know just how things are done 
In a crowded bus, you find a guy with a seat 
Then you drop your hanky so it lands at his feet 
When he stands up to get it, that's when I grab his seat! 
Yes, She's a Lady ~ I'm a Lady! ~ Oh yeah! 

He's a Singer! ~ I'm a Singer! 
Like Caruso! ~ Learned to do so, 
In a barber-shop quartet 
I once gave a hair-cut to a fellow one day 
I started singing ""Mammy"" an' kept cutting away 
Yeah, now they call him 'baldy' an' he wears a toupee! 

You're a Lady! ~ You're a Barber! 
You're a High-Brow! ~ You're a Sin-ger! 
Hee hee, I'm a Sin-ger? ~ Ha, ha ha ha! 
She's a Lady ~ Ah! He's a Sin-ger! ~ Oh yeah!

Perry Como,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
An' somehow you know, you know even then,
That somewhere you'll see her again and again!
 
Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
An' night after night as strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams!
 
Who can explain it, who can tell you why,
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try!
 
Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own
Or all through your life you may dream all alone!
 
Once you have found her, 
Never let her go!

Perry Como,"There's a big blue cloud next to heaven 
Where all wishes are stored 
Old an' new . . . 

And each day an angel from heaven 
Looks them through, 
Picks a few to come true . . . 

There are wishes from a kiddies prayer 
From folks who are apart, 
Wished from afar . . . 

From a grandma in her rockin' chair 
And from a lover's heart, 
Wished on a star . . . 

There's a big blue cloud next to heaven 
Where all wishes are stored 
Old an' new . . . 

So be patient, leave it to heaven 
And your wish will come true 
Someday soon . . .
