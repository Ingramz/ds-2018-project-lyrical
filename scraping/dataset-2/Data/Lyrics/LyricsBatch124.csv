De La Soul,"And and bass up the track a little bit 
'Cause I I'm here I want to hear that boom bish boom  knowhatI'msayin? 
Yeah yeah you know the bizness 
Common Sense  soul with the De La 
Get all them play ahs 
We the rhyme sayers 
Huh  and that's the bizness  hah 
Gonna do it like this 
Gettin it that 
Like the Chicago streets 
 
I speak divine of God theories, no need to be high 
Always exhale the facts cause I don't inhale lye/lie 
Play the greater man's game, to bounce off my losses 
So I can earn the acres (uhh) the houses (yeah) the horses (huh) 
Of course it's much greater than your Benx or your Lex 
The engine to my comprehension is just too complex 
Much too complex, EFX/effects be live like Das 
Making moves down South, to avoid the chaos 
And never, flaunt the coin 'cause dime-getters be gazin 
They call me Luther Van, they say my style is so Amazin 
I'm fazin those who're supposed to have the last laughter 
'Cause even when I'm gone I'm reappearin in the after 
I haveta, send respects to real money makers 
Do not connect us with those champaign sippin money fakers 
Taste the quarter pound with spice from Chi-town 
Now what that prove, you're so full you can't even move 

'Cause I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E 
And can't another brother cook these delicacies 
Well I'm the P-L-you, the G-to-the-One 
Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
And I'm the see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win 
I'm the see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
I sit and think with a drink

Do you want to be a MC? Or do you want to serve 
Do you want to be dope? Or do you want to deal it 
Fabricated acryllic, I feel it, I'm the style molester 
I do a show get Extra P's like the Large Professor 
In fact I get more hoes than Tessa, peep game like a 
Refa-ree in soul control of my 
Desti-ny, in the best of, three out of five 
Whip ANYBODY ass at NBA Live, rappers 
Take a dive like Greg Lougainis with his bitch-ass 
Rather be in Bebe's alley, than at the click with gators 
Not a hater of the players, I'm more like a coach, or an owner 
I Used To Love H.E.R., but now I bone her (ahuh-hah!) 
At one point in rhyme I thought I lost my erection 
But then I got it back with the Resurrection, blessings 
Upon rhymes old man who called him traitor 
Big Com Stradamus niggaz styles I predict 

'Cause I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E 
And can't another brother cook these delicacies 
Well I'm the P-L-you, the G-to-the-One 
Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
And I'm the see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win 
I'm the see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
I sit and think with a drink 

I'm the C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win 
And I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E 
And can't no other brother cook these delicacies 
Well I'm the P-L-you, the-G-to-the-One 
Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 

I'm the most from the coast of the East, then flee 
Droppin more knowledge than litter, on the New York peeve 
It's me, wonder why, in the place to be 
Certified, as superior, MC 
While others explore to make it hardcore 
I make it hard for, wack MC's to even step inside the door 
'Cause these kids is rhyming, sometiming 
And when we get to racing on the mic, they line up to see 
The lyrical killing, with stained egos on the ceiling 
My rhymes escalates like black death rates 
Over music plates, being played as the rule 
Kids thinking stepping to the Soul, you're labelled fools 
Who claims to drop jewels but for now you do the catching 
I don't worry on what crew you run, or what section of earth 
You reside, you're not even a man 
So I don't seem it mandatory taking your pride 
But I will, cause my man said Soul for the life 
You cried ""Keepin it real"", yet you should try keepin it right 
That's understanding microphone mathematics 
Which leaves the currency in temporary world status 
And when one shows he posed threat to this one 
This one will make that one into none 
Simple equation, zero, you shouldn't play hero 
If you can't stand Strong like the Island I'm from 

'Cause I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E 
And can't another brother cook these delicacies 
Well I'm the P-L-you, the G-to-the-One 
Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
And I'm the see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win 
I'm the see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
I sit and think with a drink

Now I'm the P-L-U, the-G-to-the-One 
Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
Yeah, and I'm the-see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win 
And I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E 
And can't another brother cook these delicacies 
See can't another brother cook these delicacies 
See can't another brother cook these delicacies 

Ahh that's how, that's how I'm supposed to do my thing huh 
Like triple it, alright 
That's how we do it, all the way from Strong Island to Chicago 
The type of freestyler flow 
Yeah, it's fluent, and we don't need to flow no more 
Hah

Let me tell you a little something about Soul (tell em son) 
I be a piece of the East coast, so give a toast to 
Plug Wonder why back in the day who soaked his words in jigga 
So when I ran a phrase in June you didn't catch it til December 
I'm a member of them kids from the inner city 
Giving you kitties audible treats, you be aching for making 
More money than a pagan holiday 
Not from the PJ's, yet I still got something to say",The Bizness,1996
De La Soul,"There's a lot of people out here 
Who just don't know 
What plays a factor 
In movin' heads and toes 

It be them hits 
Hangin' out of them stereo kits 
Whether cassette radio or cd bits 
Mix tapes from the best 

Going on and on 
Throughout the city grounds 
To suburban lawns 
Man  we don't play 

Even where we stay 
Videos shows the visuals 
Of jams today 
Coinciding with the rhythm 

Of the heart and neck 
The brakes got you 
In your proper context 
You let your lex or your 

Sixty-four suspension 
Bounce away all your tension 
En route to the club 
Where girls need the quenchin' 

Diamonds on your wrist 
Sunroof top 
But niggas out front 
Makin' guns go pop 

So the spot gets shut 
But on to the next 
'Cause your ears get vexed 
When they don't get the fix cause 

(These are the brakes) 
It be your listenin pleasure 
While you're doin your chores 
(These are the brakes) 

No matter where you from 
It's for you and yours 
[These are the brakes] 
Bringing it back to the brakes 

Like the 'yes yes y'all' 
(These are the brakes) 
So let it be your anthem 
When you're havin' a ball 

Well it's silly of me 
To think that I 
Would never get a chance to see 
A piece of this pie 

I sat dead in front of speakers 
Thinkin' that could be me 
Anticipatin' open microphones 
So I could emcee 

Had a catalogue of raps 
Impressin' all the 'round-the-wayers 
Before I went to bed 
Included rhymes into my prayers 
But that rhyme is all on paper 

I want my song on vinyl plates 
I dreamin' hits and doin' shows 
Makin my niggas spines shake 
Expectin' nuttin but a little bit 

Of radio play 
Gettin diced on 1 and 2's 
By the best djs, hey 
Time was kinda tight 

But still i dotted on the line 
And some expected me 
To start buhlooning in the mind 
Seein' spaces and places 
That i couldn't pronounce 
But still i had the pulleys 
To make all the bullies bounce 
With the blessings of the great 

We took it from state to state 
'Cause we landed on the good foot 
And got our biggest brake cause 
(These are the brakes) 

A mother gets mugged 
By her crackhead son 
""That's the brakes, that's the brakes"" 
You're in the wrong part of town 

So the shots make you run 
""That's the brakes, that's the brakes"" 
Your best comrades put six tabs 
In your o.e. 

""That's the brakes, that's the brakes"" 
Your boyfriend made you a carrier of HIV 
""That's the brakes, that's the brakes"" 
Now what's gonna happen 

When the sun don't shine 
I'm buyin tickets aboard 
The caravan of love 
Hey fellas 

See, money don't make shots repel 
I break woes and compose 
Some rhymes to tell 
So when the party's live 

It shouldn't be beef 
Or playin' indian roles 
I guess you thought you was chief 
Seems all broke up 

And now you woke up surprised 
Situation's gettin sticky 
Dead in front of your eyes 
We play the wall 

Similar to tacks 
Until the dj plays 
The necessary track 
In fact as the jam plays on 

Out comes all your bread 
To pay for drinks 
For them girls you want to spread 
Don't be mislead 

When the brakes inside your head 
And have you reminiscing 
On them kids who got you fed 
Until reality reveals a miss 

Who wants to know 
If you can play her real close 
Out on the dance floor 'cause 
(These are the brakes) 

It be your listenin pleasure 
While you're doin your chores 
(These are the brakes) 
No matter where you from 

It's for you and yours 
(These are the brakes)  
Ringin it back to the brakes 
Like the 'yes yes y'all' 

(These are the brakes)  
So let it be your anthem 
When you're havin, a ball",Brakes,1996
De La Soul,"Now, where the ladies at?
""Yo, we're chillin' over here""
And all the fellas?
""Takin over this year""
I heard the party's round here, right?
""You know that's right""
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Now, where the ladies at?
""Yo, we're chillin' over here""
And all the fellas, the fellas?
""Takin over this year""
I heard the party's round here, right?
""You know that's right""
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey

It's so real when we come through
Sunshine be on my sidewalk when I come through
Schoolly D like family reunions, midday may, it's all lovin'
Take a walk down to d dot c, the war's tuggin'
And ain't no druggin', my credit's a gain
While you searchin for some trick to put the shit in her name
I be spendin' on wall Street and buyin' boardwalk
Dodging problems of the world drawn out in white chalk
Peace, Mr. Walt, I'm seein' all dimensions
But unlike your eye extensions, my vision don't blur
'What' 'when' and 'word's where the gossip occur
Heard I'm sexin' sade and I bought her a fur
Battin' eyes at Toni Braxton and I bought her a fur
Now I'm hittin' Whitney Houston, oh, she bought me a fur?
Far-fetched like glass teks and kiddie rolex
Soon comin', but now it's time to kick the fun in

Now, where the ladies at?
""Yo, we're chillin' over here""
And all the fellas?
""Takin over this year""
I heard the party's round here, right?
""You know that's right""
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey

I'm pourin' out these rhymes for them kids who ain't here
Stakes is high, but we gonna try to have fun this year
Before there were guns, there was Native Tongues on these plains
Putting others on without them being pawns in this game
Cause a pawn in this game is left with no game to play
So, um, you best ta check and hear what we got to say
Now if you came to party, just let it be known
Now if you came to fight, you might get that head flown
By the one and only Maseo plug third
J.D. dove plays the wall as Kenny Cal spurts words
And a number to a crew of dope girls from the woods
And not dope meaning weed, but dope meaning (good)
Like them West Coast kids, who be throwin' up signs
I hate a buster, unless his name is Busta Rhymes
So check the way my mind moves over times and grooves
Got some money to blow, wonder why I wanna know

Where the ladies at?
""Yo, we're chillin' over here""
And all the fellas, the fellas?
""Takin over this year""
I heard the party's round here, right?

De La Soul,"It's a dog eat dog competition (no doubt) 
I'll be gone like you're wishin (and i'm out) 
'Cause i ain't got time 
For hangin around 

When you're fuckin' my love 
In all the wrong places 
It's a dog eat dog competition (no doubt) 
I'll be gone like you're wishin (and i'm out) 

'Cause i ain't got time 
For hangin around 
When you're fuckin' my love 
In all the wrong places 

Extra  extra 
What's that all about? 
I'm wishin the position 
Of my loving's sorted out 

I shed a tear cause i'm hearin' 
Nothing new or particular 
Status once parallel 
Now it's perpendicular 

And everything is just as clear as day 
Realistically explicit 
In the things you say 
I guess a ""bitch"" in the batter's 

Gonna make the flavor fatter 
But you gots to keep it for real 
Forget about your jewels and gems 
You won't be needin 

None of them 
The tool'll fix the era 
My mellow used to wear a 
Namebuckle, now he chuckle 

'Cause he earn a dime Quicker 
Talkin bout a burnin' 
Sippin on some malt liQuor 
And all these kiddies 

Wishin they were supa emcees 
But to earn my ""s"" 
I had to learn some less 
About a crime'll make million 

A dime'll make a call 
I'd rather hop on the line 
And drop a rhyme to prince paul 
'Cause it's a dog eat dog competition (no doubt) 

I'll be gone like you're wishin (and i'm out) 
'Cause i ain't got time 
For hangin around 
When you're fuckin' my love 

In all the wrong places 
Hey kid 
What's the word? 
Man, it's all about mind 

Keeping focused 
On them self-mechanisms of rhyme 
So no longer stand erect 
'Cause your thoughts are drained 

Walkin' round 
Manifesting attributes of shame 
Used to sQuabble for the mic 
But now accordingly 

We act 
Unless a club can't afford the fee 
We act 
So name that any best man 

To put us under 
Created from the ground 
Yet know nothin 
'Bout the under 

Take a glimpse 
At them pimps 
Playin record exec 
Addin up all your zeros 

So's to cut you a check 
Saying why the blunder wonder 
Could've g'd today 
So you can put up some swings 

For your seed to play 
But a swing ain't that important 
When the park's around the corner 
Filled with life causing death 

Greeting victims for the morning 
It was the moment i feared 
Nah, the moment i steered 
Upon the right path 

To know the right math 
To over stand 
It's a dog eat dog competition (no doubt) 
I'll be gone like you're wishin (and i'm out)

De La Soul,"I be that mind blessin' blessin' these lessons we've ignited 
Want to bring it to my face man you're cordially invited 
'Cause I've cited  you possess no science in your thinking 
So I'm gonna (never) you're blinking! 

Fingers be pointin' and leakin' falsifyin' the stink 
You think I'm pink I bl l link with them shades of thought and think 
(And in this corner be the hush) so play on William Rhodes 
'Cause at the sound of the bell my circle square controls 
And all MC's best sweat, we bringin' buckets of heat 

So don't fret kid I let you lick the love I secrete, yo 
Even my foes give me bravos, and that shows 
Total domination in this rhyme complication 

Yeah the skill is a cinch I rock the womb with a mic 
And in the days of the nickel and breast, I knew de yes yes y'allin'
Was the callin', clearly not for the gat 
For combat, I bring a bag of my rhymes for the SAT 

I'm Plug One-of-a-kind, for you people's delight 
And for you sucker MC's, step to your knees 
Ain't no second thoughts and all your thoughts are from Orion 
I can tell that you a devil by them rhymes you're designin' 
Your play doggin' tactics can't fuck with my facets 
Just because you talk all that glock shit don't mean you can rock 
Shit! 
Your identities on freeze 
Just a form of protozoa tryin' to cross them seas 
 
See high horse riders gettin' shot by the sheriff 
'Cause nobody's safe for crimes 
And even all you skirts need to checkin' in your upstairs attic 
'Cause Mase is smackin' hoes if hoes is startin' static 

Now it ain't all good when your jam goes wood 
So as a deterrent, I use mental current 
Got them brothers shook, peep the look comin' out of the face 
'Cause they all catch a bruise from the hits we make 
Your fame and cars should be listed as magnets 
Legends never die but they can get shot and killed 
Ain't nuttin' glitter when you're battlin MC's 
You once imitated in a mirror so to down syndrome you kneel 

The same status I heard, the same nothin' 
My ears fears the faulty locks tryin' to lock down the stops 
But I earn more than your Menudo or your Boyz II Men 
While down syndrome keeps you immune to frequencies I send 
Fresher than a sniff off havin' them J in fifth 
I identify with your rhythm 
But I exist for more than just a Benz, so mends 
I'm cuttin' off my friends to keep a smile calicum iron grain

More money than a pagan holiday 
Not from the PJ's, yet I still got something to say 

Say what man? You gritty like a diamond grenade 
For the cameo spot you tries to fool Parade 
You acrobats flip the star gazin' map, for alla that 
You'll be the first to place, and ran it all to a waste

But yo she burned my scene up like David Koresh
I guess a diamond ain't nothing but a rock with a name
I guess love ain't nuttin but emotion and game
It's a lesson well learned so praise is well due
I'm sendin off from Big I, to Kenny Calhoun
And add a reservation for the resident crew
And yo get your bowl cuz we cookin up stew
See them Cubans don't care what y'all niggas do
Colombians ain't never ran with your crew
Why you acting all spicy and sheisty
The only Italians you knew was icees, niggas price me

Blazin up your herb to escape the maze, but the problem stays
Think big get it big is my motto
You can go and play your lotto, I'll be singin like baby won't you be mine
You'll be pressin rewind, you can never see mine
Keep your eyes focused, you can't touch this or quote this
Style is crazy bogus so you can't try to approach this

De La Soul,"It's strong island for real, where the critters run wild
The prefix is 516, the top of the dial
Through the L.I. Sound, to the villa down under
And across the globe I heard a lot of folks wonderin'
So when's it coming cause the stakes is high see big money that waves
Don't put the pen to my page
And ain't nothin' wrong with standing still and relaxing
And spendin' some of that cash that Uncle Sam is gonna tax
A New York demeanor, sit back in the beamer
With nothing to lose but some gas and some minutes
Ignorin' the gazers cause some stars don't get petty
And that trash you talk is just New Years confetti
It's like that y'all, but that's all 'bout to change
Like some of my own, people tend to act strange
I'm making a scene, and it's served with it's capabilities
So set it at an island's degrees

It's strong island for real, the diagnosis is supreme
The prefix is 516, where microphones fiend
The voices that gots the gift, cause the world is on their shoulders
Makein' plans to switch from little rock to money boulders
The real proceed
My girl stands deep from nubians actin' like Columbians sellin' keys
Characters have the tendency to con themselves
To think the East Coast is only New York and Philadelph
You know the way we blow, your shit is played like pork
And as for what we be bringin' you, we live and direct from New York
I ougtta say my fam calls me Merce
Steppin' to me fool will get you punched out like a curse
It's like that y'all, let it all consume
Like them brothas who smoke, 'till they high like the moon
Soon to a town near you be them super emcees
Settin' them Long Island degrees

I hit the L.I.R.R. for big dreamers out east
And get your bank roll split
Bangin' dents out your systems
Sellin' points to get the uppercut like Sonny Liston
But eyes closed episodes
Bring you back to zeroes
The same herp playin' like he Casablanca
Blind to it, but I'm a grind him up a cup of Sanka
Servin' dimes loves on tennis courts and sorts
Laid back like grown folks sippin' tea for sport

I be sweepin' up the room with my lyrical broom
While others rhymes smell like plastic like some lunch room utensil
The official color for this planet is green
Which growns in pockets of them people willing to scheme
An't no expose, these facts are from the mouth
Profilin' through Island with that wind from down south
At last, be the world broad cast from the crew who gave you 3's
Magic on an island degrees

It's strong island for real where the critters smoke fritters
Night time excites time for the heavy hitters
Gang on hers cause in the mean time mine is home on date
Fluffin' pillows impatiently waitin' ain't no debatin'
'Bout to settle, check the level stakes is high as the sky
I got questions about your life if you so ready to die
We in the last quarter y'all, somebody's gonna cry
I think they need to set the clock before the time pass by

In the round one no nines my size can get swelly
Sensing danger I will play a ranger on my celly with my felly
We're wonderful like colorful flix
Provide a thread and needle every time the stages get ripped

You stare at false tongues, leadin the yung'un to disaster

You are about to bear witness
From the lands of long island
Takin' you to the sky's survival
I am your captain, enola
On this endless joruney
To invisions, to broaden your outer visions
To where you never been before
It's just a one night trip to love
Sun shinin' forever, and forever sun shines

Yo, leaving lasting impressions like cuts to flesh
Be that crew from the five one six point of view
With skills so tight, they the rhymes of a vagina
Them clits will turn into a diamond, the level of rhymin'
Pressure comes from lesser forms than me and my man
And we go back like life created from um, specks of sand
And there's money to be made cause cacaussians are paid
Only brothers who
Rhyme, seek bounce and catch balls
Plug 1, with them rhymes makin' your heart stall
Like them girls when you in they room when they man calls
It ain't nothin' but the thing wonder why can bring
As we come to the bring the pain everyone will sing

De la is the crew that you must hear
But please don't rush the stage
Cause even though them stakes are really high
We're really not here to race
We're just here to move your mind and soul
With perpetuated ease
It's just about the show until it's time to go
And get with the young ladies

I'm on travellin' to places that the eye can't see
But kinder, cause yo' strife don't mean a thing to me
Throwin' me criminal looks, y'all need to get in the books
And drop some water in your melon, 'stead of actin' like a felon
Aiyo son, who you tellin'? I'd make a mil if it was up to me
But since it ain't I teach my seed to bank hard
And than god, I smoke a substance of a different kind
Catch me trippin' on earth when I'm high off sunshine

Down right to dirt, wonder why makes it work
With access to talent like caucasians to yellow cabs
With an arab driver
I liven parties with marvelous confiction
Ain't no fricition when life claims them victims who be some dried up funds
Best believe that the life is strife
Cause the gun made a man outta pussys from around my way
Who usually wouldn't have a fuckin' thing to say
Last year's hard rocks are now petrified boulders
And l.i.'s finest is movin' yo' necks at shows
The anthem of ths guy has a place in yo' eye

A splash bigger than whales, I'm makin' monsters mash
Spit Pinnochio's theory when shit be looking weary

Like the best mics respond to me
Living days, like dreams of specializing in the art that pays
I be a mystic for life, so check my ID number
Emcees be kneading/needing dough while I make bread like wonder
Yes, that's what you heard, so save that acting for the screen
See you can can that manager with the beans
I bust emcees like lies surprise em out the box
Put away the soda pops I'd rather rub on the rocks

While you others represent, I present my rep 
Cause when it comes to making dents, I'm that main in print 
Even smoked from blunts which give eyes the reddish tint 
Could not prevent, you from seeing I'm the light 
But bring attention to my words like some ads in tights 
I heard you want to fight me, with your words on stage 
So Mase pulls that instrumental from the jam you made 
And as he starts cutting what you sold, I'll talk all over your tones 
As if my name was Pete Rock or Sean ""Puffy"" Combs 
Send your tattered ass home, with celly phones I roam 
With my fleet, here to make this rap game complete 
While you live fables, unstable, acting very radical 
Projecting like you're hard, when in fact you're quite vaginal

I want to be a supa emcee 
(Well you're already that) so let me step up to bat 
Attack a hit to go beyond this age of rap counterfeits 
Out of the heavens August one seven  sixty nine 
Born I  wonder why with the thoughts to rhyme 
Til there was no longer thoughts to dream 
When an unpolished demo led to limos at the age of eighteen 
Accompanied by the screams, Plug One 
Shot up with fame like novacaine it made me numb 
So numb I wouldn't been able to feel 
Niggaz diggin in my pockets for my currency reels 
But still, I make girls brown eyes blue at will (until) 
My ass was no longer mass appeal 
Oh shit, I guess that was all the fame I was alloted 
Wait a minite, new video, like a leopard I'm spotted 
In a night club chillin with Kamaal and Phife

And I likes to make it known Strong Island stylin 
For a while, so do that dance

While the voices impersonate the true who I am 
Buzzin in my ear, oh you one of those wannabees 
Always buzzin in my ear you down with supa emcees 
Steppin to me with your pleas that you gots, butter rhymes 
Man the only thing butter bout you is your spine 
Mad yellow, you can't rock the Mardi Gras, my mellow

You should have never tried to test

For fun to say they inflict pain

To have sex disguised as lovin in the rain 
Their words are more hallow than October 31st 
What's worse, hate to see the females 
Switch to sexual mentality, it doesn't match with they given anatomy 
Man they rather be hoes like that male emcee

De La Soul,"Now let's get right on down to the skit
A baby is brought into a world of pits
And if it could've talked that soon
In the delivery room
It would've asked the nurse for a hit
The reason for this?
The mother is a jerk
Excuse me, Junkie
Which brought the work of the old
Into a new light
What a way
But this what a way
Has been a way of today
Anyway
Push couldn't shove me to understand a path to a basehead
Consumer should erase it in the first wave
But second wave forms believers
And believers will walk to it then even talk to it and say...
(You got the body now you want my soul)
Nah, can't have none of that, tell 'em what to say Mase...

SAY NO GO

Nah, no my brother
No my sister
Try to get hip to this
Word, word to the mother
I'll tell the truth so bear my witness
Fly like birds of a feather
Drugs are like Pleather
You don't wanna wear it
No need to ask that question, just don't mention
You know what the answer is

Now I never fancied Nancy
But the statement she made held a plate of weight
I even stressed it to Wade

Did he take any heed?

Nah, the boy was hooked, you could've phrased the word ""Base""
And the kid just shook
In his fashion class once an A now an F
The rock rules him now
The only designs left
Were once clothes made for Oshkosh
Has converted to nothing but stonewash

Now hopping in a barrel is a barrel of fun
But don't hop in if you want to be down, son
Cause that could mean down and out as an action
What does it lead to?
Dum-da-dum-dum
People say what have I done for all my years
My tears show my hard-earned work
I heard shoving is worse than pushing
But I'd rather know a shover than a pusher
Cause a pusher's a jerk

SAY NO GO

Believe it or not the plot forms a fee more that charity
But the course doesn't coincide with the ride of insanity
Is it a chant that slants the soul to fill for it?
I know it's the border that flaunts the order to kill for it

Standing, scheming on a young one
Taking his time, eight-ball for a cool pool player
Racked it all, tried to break, miscued
Got beat by the boy in blue
Next day you're out by the spot once more
Looking hard for a crack in the hole
I ask what's the fix for the ill stuff
Word to the Dero
The answer should have been no

Run me a score from the Funky Four Plus One More
(It's the joint!)
Rewind that back
This is the age for a new stage of fiend
Watch how the zombies scream
It's the crack
Plain is plain it should explain it from the start
Behind the ideals of cranking up the heart
Now the base claim's shot over every part

Lay back smooth one drink i'll be trippin
Never don't you dare consider me a fly gal
Pal I got props on a different tip
I recall back I go for mines I get the goods
Wouldn't you know forgot my compass I got lost in the woods
Found my way and I was out I pronounce every letter
And if I had the chance i'd do it better
I heard a holler down the way and now I'm out for the time being

INTRO 

What's up  world? 

Goin' give you a little love right here 

My man  DJ Honda blessed us with a joint 

Word up  De La up in here  ha 

We goin' to spread a little love 

To some folks who up in my hair right now 

Ah'ight? Check it out 

Verse One 

It was a big deal moving my big wheel to L.I. 

Had a back yard  tho' shit moved slow 

Caught a cat on the humble  wassup  wassup  kid? 

Ya'll be memorizin' flicks of the wild things we did 

We was brick-ball niggas, six small niggas 

And they knew it, and wasn't no-body runnin' through us 

Steppin' in the backyard parties was a blast 

Fucking up our sneakers on the wet grass 

Remember getting stabbed in ya ass? 

Your Moms sat us all down 

Said we was niggas and clowns but it was just love 

And plus love showed me that she was a diamond 

Findin' out God, took a hit me dead on my heart 

And made the eye water start 

But you was strong, can ya hear me Huggy? 

Keep your mind crystal clear when your thought gets muggy 

We them easy street kids from Mr. Bryant's basement 

Wishin' for the Apollo, tryin' to get dough 

Now my time moves slow, ain't it all full circle? 

A dove cry makes the whole scene turn purple 

Remember that night you had to hide in the freezer? 

For real, see them kids were real, we still ?slear? 

But now we grown niggas, and we handling kids 

We been since day one, and the days ain't over 

Gotta share a back seat, push with the chauffer 

My Pops said he's waiting for your ass in the zone 

So we can fly to the land, and welcome you home 

Rob-O see we good to go, you know the rest... 

Don't stress, love-love baby. Ah'ight? 

Chorus 

If you got time to give, I got time to think 

See, it could all change in one eye blink 

While you in the trouble water I hope ya don't sink 

Don't sink, don't sink, don't sink 

Verse Two 

Check it out 

Some rarely saw the negative cause 

From the depths of one's blurred everything's now 

Cleared by laws 

Mad for mere seconds, in the span of dying 

Trying to tell you don't go, I'm about to blow 

No mo' innocence, it's about the dollars 

And events of fame 

Aren't you? Search your name 

From the group? Search your name 

On the dotted line, back before the rhyme I had reasons 

To punch the kid who tried teasin' during lunch 

It was a matter of pro-mo-ting de-cen-cy 

But the 'de' and the 'cy' fell off, so I sinned 

Again and again, until Jesus came down 

Wait, I'm still sinning! I guess he hasn't reached the ground! 

Thoughts of me, before my voice could 

Even recall, couldn't afford the physical peep 

How then was now, but now is not 

Yo, I'm a minute wiser but it seems, kid 

I got some beef, can't take or shake off the wrong 

Accept my apologies to Bob, pass the horn! 

No need for false alarm 

Word up! 

The Nuyopian charm is for show back again 

It's rememberin' the was that is now gone 

For the access of the now so I can move on 

For the access of the now so I, so I 

Chorus x2 

Outro 

G'night world, g'night world 

De La, yo 

My man DJ Honda is on the beat like this 

Don't sink, don't sink, don't sink, don't sink ya'll 

Just letting ya'll into the fleeing moments 

Of the memories of mine 

And about like this, one time, one time",Trouble in the Water,1998
De La Soul,"Mirror, mirror on the wall 
Tell me, mirror, what is wrong? 
Can it be my De La clothes 
Or is it just my De La song? 
What I do ain't make-believe 
People say I sit and try 
But when it comes to being De La 
It's just me myself and I 

It's just me myself and I 
It's just me myself and I 
It's just me myself and I 

Now you tease my Plug One style 
And my Plug One spectacles 
You say Plug One and Two are hippies 
No, we're not, that's pure Plug bull 
Always pushing that we've formed an image 
There's no need to lie 
When it comes to being Plug One 
It's just me myself and I 

It's just me myself and I 
It's just me myself and I 
It's just me myself and I 

Proud, I'm proud of what I am 
Poems I speak are Plug Two type 
Please oh please let Plug Two be 
Himself, not what you read or write 
Right is wrong when hype is written 
On the Soul, De La that is, 
Style is surely our own thing 
Not the false disguise of showbiz 
De La Soul is from the soul 
And this fact I can't deny 
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie 
And from me myself and I 

It's just me myself and I 
It's just me myself and I 
It's just me myself and I 

Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory for Plugs One and Two 
But that glory's been denied 
By kizids and dookie eyes 
People think they dis my person 
By stating I'm darkly pack 
I know this so I point at Q-Tip 
And he states, 'Black is Black' 
Mirror mirror on the wall, 
Shovel chestnuts in my path 
Please keep on up with the nuts 
So I don't get in aftermath 
But if I do I'll calmly punch them 
In the fourth day of July 
'Cause they tried to mess with 
Third degree, that's me myself and I 

It's just me myself and I 
It's just me myself and I

Yo  yo  excuse me 

I heard the word from word of mouth 

That you were into booking flights 

My  travel agent took a trip up north 

And I need to book a flight tonight 

I  enjoyed a getting away from day  

To day stress so I need to leave 

Soon. (If that's a case, I have no space 

But for later I'd be sore to (leave?)) 

Nah, nah, that's not gonna do, I know that you 

Can find another flight leavin the same 

Time. I need to get aboard. I can't afford 

Any penalties to sit in the main cabin 

(yo, that didn't rhyme) It doesn't matter (What does? The money.

Don't need to bail for safety, show me where the safe be 

So I can take me another trip 

To the agency, cause the travel unravel my woes 

But now the craving grows 

So, I need to get a ticket cause man, oh I, 

Need to get aboard a plane again 

Some, say I'll crash, but It's my life and cash 

Gonna write it out until the end 

Numb, to the lift of the whiff, (grow?), when I vacate frequently 

And I got, frequent flyer when I retire to death 

Tell 'em that the big see sent me 

And a lot, of brothers man. I'm not the only brother 

At the airport, needin a lift 

Off. Was a agent til I was caught and brought 

To an unfair court, pleadin the fifth

Dove: 

Now I bagged this chick but she got me wide 

Made me lose my friends and my pride 

Had me cashing my checks for her 

Lost all my self-respect for her 

When I was broke she'd go solicit other guys 

And if we made love you could see it in my eyes 

My fantasy was one day to be a millionaire 

So I could reassure that my baby girl was there 

I could feel her love, son, I taste it in her lips 

Mentally she was a trip, had a nigga whipped 

A lot of other cats got strung out in the past 

But I'ma get the love last, then I make a dash 

That's what I thought but Miss Thing was too appealing 

When I had no dough for her, she had a nigga stealing 

(Hands hot) Now I'm incarcerated, honey ain't around 

Into withdrawal from her, while I'm locked down 

Two years down I hear she's still a thick dime 

Controllin niggas pockets and even ladies' minds 

(Here she come) ? with a temptin proposition 

(Approaching me) But when she said ""Hi"" I had to listen 

I'm sweatin beans cause I know I'm gonna bait her 

Better do it now cause you're bound to do it later 

I can't refuse her, my denial's a wish 

Fell into her arm when I gave her a kiss 

Cause I like it

It ain't all good and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should it's all on you

I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been through and paid my dues
Can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all on you-whoahhha-ohh-yeah

I wish that, you could be a little bit more upfront
Weigh the situation how you want right
The lovin' that you claim is just a four letter word
The third letter's invitin' so visualize the verb

You curve thoughtways when you're handlin' the candleabra
So you sittin' on the baby grand
Transmittin' like you're made of man
But you paint a funny face like a chick
When I see you I'ma tell you quick that

I can't believe we built this large pizza pie together no pepperoni
Yeah, you wanted extra cheese, sometimes I gave you extras
How we divided slices like the Red Sea theory
I was Moses hopelessly scorned by your thorn zapora

Tried to bring that fairy-tale life, you wanted horror
But my microscope couldn't see or cope with that
I had to bolt from that, and left you dead in the sea
It's better for me, I'm satisfied with reppin' for D

We were certified hot, then dropped to lukewarm
Now we back up in the spot, claimin' never been gone
Niggaz who cut us off, wanna reattach us now
(Them girls who brushed us off, say they want some [unverified] to dial)

Yeah, I give that ass a number and some lumber to pile
Now catch a curve from my kick
(Or show me lovin' by brick)
So stick to the same plan, don't come shakin' my hand
Like we peeps, it ain't beef but be sure to understand
Between us, it ain't all

You see them kids be schemin' on what we done copped
Always out there schemin'
They steady fiendin' for the moment they can get us off the block
Why they always fiendin'?

Your people might have your back
But you need to watch your front
Indeed, ain't nothin' guaranteed
That's the truth, things ain't goin' like you think they should

A lot say they wanna walk in my size 10's
Aight then, here's a pair
Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me
You see ain't no young boys up in here, keep a clear head

Tryin' to keep my pockets on stuffed like deer heads
Upon the wall, so all the gall we get from y'all don't faze
So mind your biz and walk away
'Cause I'm never gonna let you up inside my maze

I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been there and paid my dues

Midnight to four, name at the door
But the whole crew I can get in as well
So I got on my cell, called my nigga C. Smith
Let this be a jam that we need not miss
Yeah I'm already en route, no doubt
Might even jump up on the mic
To make sure that this party's turned out
And we some punctual types, on time, look for the line
To stand we find girls screaming the blues
Miscellaneous shoes everywhere
Yo Mase, what happened here?

And that's why them dudes hearts all pumped
Done closed the club down,
Cause one of they niggas got jumped
Jump, jump, jump to it!

No matter you Braveheart or shook
You can catch a bottle from the right, tap to the left
Kicks to the mids relieving you of breath

My only advice is don't fall and book ass
For the nigga who slip, don't fall in a position

Acting like you wore a crown
Some occasions long and mean to earn the right
To throw signs wearing only one color scheme
And being positive is no exclusion
That's an illusion, you can still catch contusions
For flossing your hard-earned shine
I'm talking games ? the longest
Then it's some other niggas time

We had to put this one on the album why know?
Yeah, this is dedicated 
To them punk motherfuckers out in Germany

Tried to knock me senseless

Keep 'em shook like spray cans (it's so hot)
It's so hot it'll make your face tan (ooh!)
Ace ban rap, the place the wasteland

Bit why'all in my mouth, but you taste bland
I feel fake niggaz and mince these snake niggaz

And if it don't +Rockwild+ we fin' to drop a bomb

Get smacked for the B.S. you been on
Storm bad weather/whether or not you stay scorned

For ten years I've baked shit like hot potato
Rhymes still drippin like stu-be	's, you groupies
need to show I.D. before the bust down
Touched down the God put 7 to your Zippo

It's the one and only effect, that you catch from a cassette
Straight wig out the world and girls we straight dig out ya back
 
with letters spellin' out my name
All over your marquee, cause the spark is me
Currently we can be seen across your screen
Stayin' wide-eyed 'cause you niggaz tryin' to scheme

Welcome to the spot - I'm slaying with it
Chop it up and fit it inside your quart of rice
You speak ghetto falsetto on the mic device
Tryin' to give me third degree, you just a third of me

Couldn't be the shit if you were a turd of me
A man tight with my funds, crush like Ricky D
who quoted Vance Wright - no one can serve us!
My squad advance heights quite superb

Just kick off your shoes - jump on the jock
It's been a long time comin' this you NEED to cop!

[Chorus]

It goes one (one) two (two) three (three) four (four)
Bounce so much I ricochet up off the floor (floor)
So raw shit the most raw you ever saw
Quarter after four, niggaz quick to bust the back door

Baby - open your blouse while I joust another nigga's spouse
Quick Jamaican dick style all in they house
I practice to be the all access, you see the fact is
my mouth dirty, so follow while I display the slackness

Yo, you see my slang talk straight from the slums
When I was young, moms put soap on my tongue, and yo-yo
Forever we gettin' this CHEDDAR with the quickness
While I cast the spell on these bitches, you can be my eyewitness

Short fuse, nowadays Langston Hughes
We gettin' money with whoever - even the Jews
The way we finagle and gain it must be all in my shoes
Fuck a nigga up with De La like (?) can amuse

Got bitches throwing they drawers on stage, that ain't me!
I raise kids, push whips, piss an MC
Love money like I love my moms
Love my nigga Com Sense when he bang dents all up in they wallets
Wall to wall bullshit I got hardwood floors
Set sail for tour ever since eighty-nine
So why y'all are fucking the same hoes who used to be mine

[Tash]
And I've been waiting three summers to rhyme longside my people
Rico, De La, inject you with the lethal
Dose of hop-hipping if you thought CaTash was slipping
Then put that drink down, you drunk off what you sipping
CaTash put the dip in dip dive socialize
Fuck around with me and next you'll find yo' crib burglarized

Yo you better recognize and try to analyze this
Hand over fist, how can a man act like a bitch?
Change and switch, snitch on his crew
Yo get rid of the niggas before the same thing happen to you

[Pos]
And they'll leave your ass sticky like glue
Blood leaking out, girls freaking out, motherfucking cops tweaking out
Got you on your knees like a freak, juggling deez nuts
Smuggling these cuts from S.C., you best be-
Lieve there's no web or leave a net
We done swallowed 40 bottles of threat, yo

What you know about my writes? (my writes)
What you know about what's weak, what's tight?
And what you know about an off night? (uhh)
What you know about niggas fronting for the light?
And what you know about them gun fights? (gun fights)
Got a nigga ducking while them girls show fright
What you know about my writes? (my writes)
Ah what you know about my writes? (my writes)

[Xzibit]
Yeah, yeah, look
I'm Samson without Delilah, the soul survivor
The drunk driver that rolls straight, take the whole cake
Chop it up with the family, wash it down with alcohol
My telly's a Desert Eagle for all the fucking shots I called
My niggas gotta ball, never settle for less
Heavy metal, heavy on yo' chest like two breasts
Step into my office cause it's time for you to roll something
One false move, and we gon' beat you like you stole something

[Pos]
Yo these style I kick should be called ? rap
Drawing the pussy out the nigga after my prize, cause I want it
They stomach what I throw, they know I'm right for they diet
They librarian flow keeps the party real quiet 
The love I lost outweighs the rhymes I gain
But the fact that I spit 'em makes me cherish the name
So pass the mic so I can put in my share
I rip it from home to L.A.
With connecting flights to rip it elsewhere

Drinking up Black and Tan in the back of a van
 
I learned as a young man, long trip, piss in a can
Getting a house for two grand, now you got your own land
Let your mind expand, everyday have a plan

You got to live with the cards dealt in yo' hand
Stay young like Peter Pan, like Sly, take a Stand
And go Uptown Saturday Night like Ichiban

I keep it dirty like under the bed (dirty)
Dirty like Uncle Red, hey yo
Dirty brown Likwit flow thicker than the Yoo-Hoo
Dirt you dishing out, chef telling it all
Face down in the dirt, doing my dirty work
Expert, trying to regulate my network
Head jerk, spice it with rice, stick with it
If they ask who cut the grits I'ma say E-Swift did it

Tash'll punch you in your grill and leave 'Potholes in Yo' Lawn'

I can shut why y'all niggas down like the why-2-K
I did a tour in ninety-four with De La Soul and Tribe
We on the same vibe, cause real niggas coincide
(Right-right-right) The situation is drastic
But see songs like these is why this album going classic

Hey yo, we theme park status, upstage these niggas like Gladys
Them little Pips, they done tripped the wire
Blaming they legs, while I'm claiming these tunes
In this we'll stay down like seats found in sorority bathrooms

[Xzibit]
Yeah, we flat out classic, separate the real from the plastic
And I gotta say no names
Play no games, hit the switches, crack the frame
Show no shame or fuck it all up, take the blame
Brand name fresh out the box type hustle
Manpower success is mind over muscle
Grind til the wheels fall off, accept the loss
I never been soft, whatever the cost, addicted to floss
Nailed to the cross it's time to return
My only concern is making sure that Hollywood burn,
Hollywood burn, burn to the ground, trick-ass niggas
Is all up in the game and don't deserve to be down

[J-Ro]
Four bottle rap, twist the cap and kick back
De La, Xzibit and Tha Liks came to get that
And what you know about us dropping ya
And leaving you with half a face like the Phantom of the Opera?

Get your ass up, and let's get ill
That's right y'all, we more than rough, we callin your bluff
And when it comes to rhymes (Brick City)

Yo, don't scandalize mine
I spent too much time
Straight talk with the catch to etch my line walk
Never fetchin for crime Halt! Who goes there?

Yo, it's the squeeze of five fingers, puffin Smokey the Bear
Shinin black like Darth Vader caps, they on stare

While we rockin it, I'll rock in it (rock in it)
Like the little ball inside the spray can
Providing three coats for both child, woman and man

God bless the God, lay these Streets Wall to Wall
It go ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, you got popped like a flick by that rivalry clique
It went ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

It ain't my fault your ass is on the ashphalt
Got your chin touched by my fam who though you brought harm, you see
I'm iced out like a glass of tea
Better yet, oatmeal cookies, y'all just rookies to me
Slidin' up and down the court, but I don't think you can D
Why try? Maseo be gettin high since Luke was Luke Skywalk'
Man, my topic of talk is sheddin shame all over your game
Like them shorties who claim that afrocentric lovin is the past drug
A life filled with (*GUNS*) that's what thugs love
Snatch you fast, wrap that ass in the rug of your choice
While it muffles your voice

Now when I'm swimmin through the joint, I put the funk on hold
Cause if you don't, you'll see the bubbles come up
We run up a tab and gladly add a little extra for miss
Flashy faces with bigger lips for that ass to kiss

Most crews are post-current while we're forever
Direct beats that's contagious, loved by all ages
Graduated from the you-and-I-versity
Of hard-hitters, for real

I got niggas in the streets that'll blast your ass for the shine
And get ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, if you a fat chick gettin your fuck on tonight
Then go ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, put your hands opposite to the ground if you're lovin our sound
Go ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, and to my broke niggas on the corner holdin me down
Go ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

Yo, I swear Tommy gonna get it, he done did me wrong
I had plans to buy more land, plant corn
Bust kernels on heat, work hard like wetbacks
Set backs is gonna get my ass to be hostile
Rockwilder the beat, top dollar defeat
Big money's make the big decisions
Keep hip-hop alive, it's just an intermission
Back to the second half of the feature flick
Dick stacks and fuck rap

I had a name for makin paper since paper mache
Now my dollar coins join pounds of yen for play
While you broke niggas reach drunk much quicker
You don't make enough bread to soak up all your liquor
Went from God to God damn

Damn God, you're killin it
Should incorporate it, invest half a mil' in it
Rap cats talk with no will in it

Soundin like they virtual
This joint'll hurt you, yo

Twas the night before Christmas and my crib got robbed
(shh shh shh, shh) They did a job
Took all my goodies out from under the tree, except the CD's
Of shiny suit rappers and flossin emcees
Who fail at takin it to rhyme degrees

Man, you know no wack poems get no play in our homes
You need to not get nappy with me
Or else we gon' ""relax your mind, let your conscious be free""

Yo, where my Wall Street niggas, if ya up in the stands
Go ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
To my women that'll throw they hands against they punk-ass man
Go ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

I was sittin on my lunchbreak, grittin my teeth
It's the last day of the week, man what a relief
My arms are sore as hell, I felt rigid and stiff
so I turned around and I rolled this big fat spliff
That's when I seen her, steppin out a rented yellow Beemer
This local ghetto fame rap cat her name was Tina
She was braggin she was goin on tour
The same shit she was screamin since the year before
Ever since the De La Soul video, she seen me on the TV
Heard that she was holdin a grudge and tryin to see me
Workin underground circuits and mad cyphers of people
When she asked who was ill, all she got was Indeed
She want to battle (what?) and it wasn't hard to tell
All that I was thinkin bout was tryin to smoke my L
I had four hours left and I was tired as hell
Plus it was 12:55 almost time for the bell
She had an ill screwface mug, frontin like she know Joe
Gangsta bitch profile, boppin like allegro
Forty-below Timbos, fatigues saggin
Pullin all her money out her pocket while she's braggin
on her gold fronts with her name on it
Her ice finger roll hand g-low while she claim fame on it
I peeped the stee' - then I crushed her with ease
just for interruptin me while I was rollin my trees

AIGHT? (Whoo!)
That shit was bla-bla-bla, bla-blaze! (word)
Now we gon' se-se-set, se-set this one up
for my man Mercenary (aight aight yo let's do this)
(whassup?) Yo, I don't want you to make it like
a story or nuttin (aight)
I just want-want, want want-want
want you to come on some straight rhy-rhy-rhyme

Had em all soft to hard back to soft like a nipple

Break you down to your very last participle
Let me enlighten you, cause your third eye's on dim
Me gettin taken out is rare like a smile from Rakim
See I'm remarkable, you're just bull
last name shit, why'all niggaz need to quit
Open your mitt, and catch this
I autograph every word you bit
??Testify then?? take your picture
Got an infinity of non-rhymes to hit ya
while your whole clan is blam
Understand that you must be smokin POUNDS of weed out of a pipe
and mistook your munchies, for bein hungry for the mic
And now you have to deal with these cats who's truly right
like estates with a pit on the lawn bark at the gates
Put the whole entire plate in your face
Make the point like who's that on that joint? It's me
I'm in everything you see like ??, yo I'm in demand
I'm in the club man I'm in your hand
bein bought, I'm even in the thought from your girl
The only thing you're in is in acting
Your world'll be smashed
Run against the Won and you'll be last

Two G's got 'em scratchin' it like the fleas
And Ad Rock got it locked like a crooked cop
Now, it's Ad Rock, y'all remember me
The guy ya bit ya style from off the TV

I score Mmmma-Zah-Ayy's all day
My essays are felt worldwide
We like four planets on the mic
Aligned arrays retired all in the days
Game, too blam for these lames

When I was nine, I played with slime
Got rhymes ga-lot, got rhymes ga-limes
I got a million like rhymes leavin' ya stung
I got my own crew called the nasal tongue

Yo take a few of these be-boys and call me in the mornin'

Keep it on the crusty eye, bagel with some butterflies
Spit gritty like we in MCA's voice box
Y'all bull and my ox don't fit the mix

Get on the mic if you love all the creatures

Well yeah, I got these fishes swimmin' 'round my baracuda
Back in '82 I used to ride a street scooter
Called 'em cuter than pigtails, sales you keep 'em level
And smack you with a shovel and break your lifestyle

Firm on the mic since my days of a child
Got a 'License Too Ill' to flash to police
The only beast I huddles with the Beastie Boys
Bringin' 'Noise' like P.E. to your TV

Stripped to the rhyme
And every line made from scratch
Attached like stripes to shell-toes
Thin spools that hold the herb

This stuff from hip-hop that's bein' misused
It's desirin', acquirin', tryin' to be like Iverson
If it means backstabbin' and also conspirin'

Now, the people in the front, you do the bump, bump
The people in the back, they're not the whack, whack
The people in the middle, come on and wiggle, wiggle
And the people on the side, we can all take a ride

In my VW I done swung an ep' or two
The rear in my hatchback y'all know I scratched that
Here to haystack, keep it rosy in the Rolls
Skiddin' out to place my vote at the polls for Ad Rock

Well, I'm the the toe tapper, yes the hand clapper
From the middle school like the educated rapper
I'm known as an occupational MC
You think I lose sleep if you sleep on me?

From two crews spittin' for the art of it
We ain't takin' over but damn sure takin' part of it

Part-time father if you ask my daughter's mommas
Missin' in action cause the action got a fraction
of the world listenin' to me

Got em travellin' overseas in lands constantly
Got a sea of hands wavin', ain't misbehavin'
but a lot of kids cravin' for somethin' they ain't got
Like the keys to the ride and a pocket with a knot and it's

Holdin' they ground 'til they rot in it
Plottin' it, lockin' it down strong
'Cause it's nuttin' wrong gettin' your bubblin' on sticker
But too much bubblin' can make you fizz quicker

So watch your stack, keep your fam intact
and pay attention to the now, I'm clearin' the mess
While they stressin' back in the day, I'm at the front of the night
with my crew shinin' light on the (ahhhh, ahhhh)

[Chorus: x2]

[Pos]
Now we on top of this like a typical bed position
Peepin' your view, got your whole crew wishin' and waitin'
Makin' dollars out of ten dime pieces
who be sippin out the glass suckin' on the lime pieces included

In my pieces I pen the good livin'
And even when we're stressin' from in the hood livin'
at least we're livin' and there ain't no hell in that
Give me a yell in that, and go (ahhhh, ahhhh)

[Dove]
I want to see the world ten times over
Dive off cliffs and land on oppotunities unthinkable
You sinkin straight to the bottom; while I float in parades
that St. Patty couldn't put up

All my niggaz tryin to build, then throw your wood up
Design life like PNB gears so stand clear for the blast off
Last off my chest, peace to Dav West
Live your life to the fullest (ahhhh, ahhhh)

You, heard this on day first
Watch my man, he'll make it worse
Ain't no new click, we still Native

Clothes knit, stitched tight, related
that's the way we handle it
Pin us up or mantle it
We on fire you candle lit
Daydreamin', on a rack
Get bought worn and brought back
We sport rhyme thought real tight

To gain sizes much bigger
Life life well, get mail filled with

I want it big like white boy wallets

But I'm not no old fool
Heard out your mouth words flee
'Bout 'These niggaz ain't nice'
You just barbershop talkin'
While we round the world walkin'

You slip and fall on my ice
No lyin', straight shinin'
I give you supper from my upper diamond
You got limbs so climb in

Yo, soak up what you find-in
We too pure for you to try
You sniffin' maybe's and if's

How you goin' tell me to mind my own biz
When you lookin like somethin I need to know about?
I used to go about it the wrong way, tuggin your arm when you'd pass
But I see you got class besides all that

Yeah I'm picky in my own way too
While the rest of these fools is lookin to screw your brains out
I blinged out don't(?) want to stand froze
Practicin my hello's, hey lady, how you doin

Renewin these vows is like fifty steps beyond from here
Shit I don't even know your name yet (word)
Ain't sure what your character contains yet
But damn lady, you could be my Valentine

Cupid got his infrared on my chest clocked
Let the rest flock, they just birds anyway
I grow my confidence in words the Henny way - yeah, buy me a drink
So we can sink into that thought path..

Despite the fact some kid is runnin' chitta-chat in your ear
How the hell we get here, with me over here, and you over there
When we can make, such an obvious pair?
Why miss? Have you misread my shyness for conceit?
I'm peepin' how you move it to the pace of the beat
 
Got my eyes on wide as they constantly collide with yours
Your heavenly body rushin' the tide to shore
Your heavenly body rushin' these guys to the floor
To find pleasure in your double digit design, 

But these clowns look hurt
And as a woman's ex-nigga I'm a woman ex-pert
Understandin' how the ovaries and all that shit work
Extremely dreamy, my eyes you look surprised

That I'm movin' closer - don't be, I'm supposed to D.C.
Are you for real or a tease?

Now let that drink set in sweet, we up close and personal
Ain't nuttin dull about this, sharp like Swiss precision

Suckin the straw huh? You know the head game
First place chick girl I'm all about winnin too
I want my trophy life-sized in a see through

While I got a lot of brand in my name, I'm recognizable
Leavin' me the cash amount, that's quite sizable
Rich in that English that's broke as hell
That's why my niggas in the hood understand me so well
Its the modern rap type talk
Used to walk, all over your ears
You hear the thump, this track pumps like, well order
Some others fell short of the line of finish
You didn't practice harder at the scrimmage
Now my image is the golden cup
My career is dirty compared to yours, it's all washed up

We, we, we, we regulate and cross plates, destruct ya
Toss coins to distract it and we bust ya
Minds blow bigger than tempers out in Russia
Cuss like a sailor, make you shame like Thelya
Stitch a verse tailored to fit
Spray paintin' your spit
On the deco we art, spread apart
I raid mo' tracks than flicks in ""Beat Street""
With kicks until the sole/soul wear out, never that!
We weather that, you light in the ass and feather that
Heavy like black leather coats, you pleather that
Last dick on the line, we way ahead of that
Squeezin' like Freddie Foxx, and his two glocks
Rocks don't impress niggas who speak to God
We get jams to make a tuna melt
Held down by the B.E.P, we strictly, new getty
Two-fifty up in front of the mic, so what it look like?

[Chorus]",Cali to New York,2000
De La Soul,"Now let's get right on down to the skit
A baby is brought into a world of pits
And if it could've talked that soon
In the delivery room
It would've asked the nurse for a hit
The reason for this?
The mother is a jerk
Excuse me, Junkie
Which brought the work of the old
Into a new light
What a way
But this what a way
Has been a way of today
Anyway
Push couldn't shove me to understand a path to a basehead
Consumer should erase it in the first wave
But second wave forms believers
And believers will walk to it then even talk to it and say...
(You got the body now you want my soul)
Nah, can't have none of that, tell 'em what to say Mase...

SAY NO GO

Nah, no my brother
No my sister
Try to get hip to this
Word, word to the mother
I'll tell the truth so bear my witness
Fly like birds of a feather
Drugs are like Pleather
You don't wanna wear it
No need to ask that question, just don't mention
You know what the answer is

Now I never fancied Nancy
But the statement she made held a plate of weight
I even stressed it to Wade

Did he take any heed?

Nah, the boy was hooked, you could've phrased the word ""Base""
And the kid just shook
In his fashion class once an A now an F
The rock rules him now
The only designs left
Were once clothes made for Oshkosh
Has converted to nothing but stonewash

Now hopping in a barrel is a barrel of fun
But don't hop in if you want to be down, son
Cause that could mean down and out as an action
What does it lead to?
Dum-da-dum-dum
People say what have I done for all my years
My tears show my hard-earned work
I heard shoving is worse than pushing
But I'd rather know a shover than a pusher
Cause a pusher's a jerk

SAY NO GO

Believe it or not the plot forms a fee more that charity
But the course doesn't coincide with the ride of insanity
Is it a chant that slants the soul to fill for it?
I know it's the border that flaunts the order to kill for it

Standing, scheming on a young one
Taking his time, eight-ball for a cool pool player
Racked it all, tried to break, miscued
Got beat by the boy in blue
Next day you're out by the spot once more
Looking hard for a crack in the hole
I ask what's the fix for the ill stuff
Word to the Dero
The answer should have been no

Run me a score from the Funky Four Plus One More
(It's the joint!)
Rewind that back
This is the age for a new stage of fiend
Watch how the zombies scream
It's the crack
Plain is plain it should explain it from the start
Behind the ideals of cranking up the heart
Now the base claim's shot over every part

It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should - it's all on you

I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been through and paid my dues
Can't change how you feel, 'cause it's - all on you-whoahhha-ohhh-yeah

I wish that, you could be a little bit more upfront
Weigh the situation how you want (right)
The lovin that you claim is just a four letter word
The third letter's invitin' so visualize the verb
You curve thought ways when you're handlin' the candelabra
So you sittin' on the baby grand
Transmittin' like you're made of man
But you paint a funny face like a chick
When I see you I'ma tell you quick that uhh...

Chorus 1/2

I can't believe we built this large pizza pie together
No pepperoni
Yeah you wanted extra cheese, sometimes I gave you extras
How we divided slices like the Red Sea theory
I was Moses hopelessly scorned by your thorn zapora
Tried to bring that fairy-tale life, you wanted horror
But my microscope couldn't see or cope with that
I had to bolt from that, and left you dead in the sea
It's better for me, I'm satisfied with reppin for D

We were certified hot, then dropped to lukewarm
Now we back up in the spot, claimin never been gone
Niggaz who cut us off, want to reattach us now
(Them girls who brushed us off, say they want some #'s to dial)
Yeah I give that ass a number, and some lumber to pile
Now catch a curve from my kick (or show me lovin by brick)
So stick to the same plan, don't come shakin my hand
Like we peeps, it ain't beef but be sure to understand
Between us, it ain't all..

Chorus

You see them kids be schemin on what we done copped
Always out there schemin!
They steady fiendin for the moment they can get us off the block
Why they always fiendin?

Your people might have your back, but you need to watch your front
Indeed, ain't nothin guaranteed

That's the truth!  Things ain't goin like you think they should

A lot say they want to walk in my size 10's
Aight then; here's a pair
Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me
You see ain't no young boys up in here; keep a clear head
Tryin to keep my pockets on stuffed - like deer heads
Upon the wall, so all the gall we get from y'all DON'T FAZE
So mind your biz and walk away
Cause I'm never gonna let you up inside my maze

I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been there and paid my dues
I can't change how you feel, cause it's all, on you-whoahhha-ohhhhh

I'm wit Tone Touch, while ya all touched in the head
Such a lethal combination, got you facin' the red
And um, yo, you don't want no parts in that
You style so pussy, last name should be Cat
We takin it back, like flea stacks and pylons
Wit the ladies in a frenzy, runnin' they nylon
Reveal flesh to test, cause I love bruisin' 'em
Treat my battles like my children nigga, I'm never losin' 'em

No one can rock it like this, we put it down yo
For who? Black, white, purple or brown yo

Pero what's that? You don't know, that's my sound yo
No one can rock it like this, we put it down yo

So all my street folk come on gather round yo

Pardon me son, but the only Spanish I knew, was dame un beso
Cut bitches wit niggas, who nettin' the peso
Ya breathin' on beats like this, if you say so
I stay sippin' on God theories, so where the case yo?
Wait flow on four floors like film edits
Fuck sayin' the name, you read it in the credits
Sit that ass down on my lyrics
We servin' niggas up some beans and rice, everything is everything
Heavy metal thing, rock, wit Mos and Pos and us
Written flows get broke down by the comas
From L.I. lawn, I green shit up in my wallets
To fly the wrong places, and get red like scarlet
How I dollar it, I just earn the say
So when the itchy itchy come, I satisfy the crave
And let it fall a little too much
I let Tone touch my ears to let the bullshit disappear

Respect the architect or be next to catch a pela
I send ya all runnin' home to your abuela

Kick a wicked rhyme like a fortune teller
This fella, se pone feo quando llego
I still be shoutin' out cats in San Diego
I'm still in effect, and I'm still doin the huevo
I still be putting it down, till I'm a viejo

Soul rebels trap up, we got a long way to go
Before this here blow like a volcano
We get eternal, this is what you waitin' for
You try to front and play the role
When you more like a pimp who pay the ho
With my name up in your mouth like fellatio
I lace the flow on purpose even up the ratio
Of Hip-Hop to that shit they drop on the radio
Underground classics is what they used to say before
Now we break the surface quiet like an alligator nose
They hate it, cuz they know if they don't get it, then they may be slow
We still gonna blow like the horn played by Horatio
The stakes is three feet high and risin' like De La Soul
So I got Wonder Why, my man Dave and Maseo
We all got babies so we embrace the taste of dough
But y'all already know so I ain't gotta say no mo'

(De La) is whatcha need, (Reflection) is whatcha need
We got the masters of the ceremonies
Blessin' emcees (lip professin' emcees)
From LI to Brooklyn to Cinncinnati, Hi-Tek and Kweli got this on lock D

Party to party, body to body
When we come into the jam we do it wildstyle

Yo! I'm homegrown for the bain, once I rock the mic plain
It's the extravaganza we glad you came
Made only for them heads, it's infra-red Aim
For such a world figure, we got figures to gain

I ain't Icabod Crane get that ass cooked hard cuz we raw like Kane
Been known to mic spit, infinite per frame

Ain't some old school G poppin' memory lane, been on it future robotic
Since the day I came
If you don't know Plug Wonder Why is my name
Most recognized leo with my size in mane
Matter a fact track is simple and Plain
Cuz the complexities I freeze is too deep to detain
Reflect, Kwa-Tone Tek eternally in the game (and De La) oh fo' sho'
We be shinin' the same

(De La) is whatcha need, (Reflection) is whatcha need
We got the masters of the ceremonies
Blessin' emcees (lip professin' emcees)
From LI to Brooklyn to Cinncinnati, Hi-Tek and Kweli got this on lock D
(Let me hear you scream out loud) if you're somebody
Party to party, body to body
When we come into the jam we do it wildstyle

Y'all think these challengers is here to make a man fold
Shoot I've been holdin' these joints since I was day old
Came to confirm the fact that I've been on the payroll
Stay cold til one day make it hot and fade old
Continue til I'm dyin, rottin' out gray and old
I told them fool before they pass they have to pay toll
While I've been sittin' at the table eatin' steak whole, side of greens
Baby yams you know it stay soul, pre-natal
But they want to come spit your way so
So was I supposed to go and say no
Right emcees some walking straight, some take the gay stroll
I get my man to clamp they asses like they staples
I'm from LI we take it far as out as naples
And scrape hoes who'll be willing to take clothes off (off)
See once you bet it all against reflects eternal
You lose every rapper on a dept
Y'all need to pay ya dues

(De La) is whatcha need, (Reflection) is whatcha need
We got the masters of the ceremonies
Blessin' emcees (lip professin' emcees)
From LI to Brooklyn to Cinncinnati, Hi-Tek and Kweli got this on lock D

[Verse 1]
It's a pity that you're so dirty
Worthy of some Southern hos-pital
See we them Northern boys with nose and how's
NYC livin' ain't nothin' like it
See how me and my peeps fit, we jigsaw
Sometimes I play big saw to cut the deal
And we keepin' them bills paid with meals in the mouths of many
A noble job at Feni
Money ain't everything but everything makes me want it
But won't dishonor my name so the claim throwers
Act like game on the dice on the mic device
Stay above middle class for life
Not an easy task but I've grown to love it
Dub it to tape, why don't you whip a grin
While I speak to my mens about the world problems
And girl problems with no immediate way to solve em'
But I'm on hits

[Chorus]
I make the best of the life I be with it
Making the most of the moment among the livin'
And it feels good
Being the man that I want to be
Do what I can cause I refuse to see
The best of luxury, God's been good to me
Now I'm asking am I worthy of you, of you
Am I worthy of you

[Verse 2]
Pull them quarters down
I got some things on these nine ounces to vamp
Me on a mission why'all
Dug fresh dirt out the ground
Lookin' for the treasures in life
A bambino picket fence around the residence
I wore these shackels here for thirteen years
 
But the only real slaves is the ones we record on
We off all checks and God's blessin'
Tryin' to own a thousand island like we salad dressin'
Patience for the main course
Don't have me in position to remain boss
Cause the man next to the man above the exec
Don't give a damn if I papered yet
Sometimes it make me want to go make a bet
I did away with knock em' and release some stress
By any means, these petty greens will only get me stuck in a box
Doin' a dick shot in Oz, jerkin' off in the J
But anyway I keep my head on

[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I know people who tippy-toe through they own stompin' ground
Master not makin' a sound to stay safe
From the local star renaissance
And the response is usually the same
Wishin' like it used to be
Nothin' in that life is new to me
We roll like eyes on a ghetto girl
Brushin' off some no-man cause she's his ghetto pearl
We into livin' beyond not livin' fads
Me and my comrads became dads young
Try to have fun amongst responsibility
Like fillin' these accounts full
Got caught up at a party in Bull's
Sometimes gotta have the nerve to say some rhymes
Because some minds take offense
Try to make ya life tense but we still here
Still gainin' the love, still standin' above most

You women wanna frown at them stick figures
On them little ass girls, when a clique of niggas
Run up and try to hurl game for real

Don't mind you being conscious of ya calories
If gettin paper was fat man you'd be salaries
You ain't in this alone I got a tummy too
Just lemme watch the weight don't let it trouble you (C'mere girl)

You buy the size seven and just make it fit

Ladies and gentlemen, we in the trench again
Makin it relevant, just for the hell of it
I'm introducin it, throw a little juice in it
Got on that old bullshit to get you used to it
It's been a minute now, only a minute now
A little re-evaluatin, hope you feel me now
I'm on some new me, focused on the new tree
Tryin to shake the money off the limbs so I can do me
I blame the fans for it, I heard demands for it
Went to Somalia, they holdin out they hands for it
Went to the hood, these niggaz tried to trace a dance for it
Dancefloor it after Mase brings you out of the break

-- Before we go any further we want to send a special thanks
To all those folks out there that been supportin De La since '89

Unlike these underground MC's who rock for heads
We include the throat chest arms and legs
No need to spit in the cypher to show you I'm a lifer for rap
I cultivate moves larger than that
And I don't ball too much, ya dig
I gotta ball and chain at my crib who want my ass home
My heart-BEAT N.Y.C. metronome
But can't adapt to where I'm at
And even though I sing it sick 'til I'm blue, I'm not a crip
So unlike non-GANG members I won't see-walk to look hip
But if I had to join a gang I think I'd join GangStarr
Me, Guru and Primo with them beats for the car
That bounce trampoline style, revamp the deen child
Hot and mild and I hustle rap the same
Cuff a little shit, due to muscle fat, I gain
We them God type dishin the grunge to make you love

-- Yeah kids
Just a little taste how we gon' get things started in a minute
Sit back, get your headphones straight

De La Soul,"Around me, bringing down, ah yea yea yea yea yeah
Life

This is dedicated to all my folks
Diagnosed with a bad case of that proper upbringin'
And never took the time to fall in line or follow
Or swallow the thoughts

Of the recognized committees who lurk throughout ya cities
Ya hood, ya town, no matter which type
You from the same type of people try to hold you down
Just because you tailor made for bigger and better things

Never missed a chance to move ahead of things
And what does it bring? I tell you for me
It brought jealousy in back wounds from all the stabbin'
Cats posin' as my fan just to get grabbin' what's mine

I'm livin' in times where my daughters are found around
Kids who can't afford thinkin' caps
But always found drinkin' raps and eatin' off beats
Claimin' laws of the streets, but who made the laws?
Everybody playin' rebel with no sign of a cause

Well I feel the world around me
I've found that others will bring you down, just to be down
You've got to make up your mind, where you want to be
Where you want to go with your life
With your life

I'm never singin' the blues but findin' the clues to maintain
And I been blessed to reign supreme over nearly every dream
I had, and I made it come true
I'm an imperfect man and I'm holdin' the clue

To perfection, it doesn't seem to matter what direction I look
I find people settin' traps
Tryin' to find the goal, without havin' any maps
Even friends of mine, jumped online, just to become my adversary

They felt they were entitled to the dairy I made
They don't come to chill or behave
 
And they got, toast ready to burn
Not learnin' to live, but they yearnin' to take what you earn

Well I feel the world around me
I've found, that others will bring you down, just to be down
You see, you've got to make up your mind, where you want to be
And where you want to go with your life
With your life

So quick to place blame, and deny the shame we bring upon ourselves
So many names held accountable for my own account
When a large amount was weighed, that I made and shaped
When I climbed I found

It was hard to find others around to point my fingers at
Which made me realize the truth
The biggest suppressor could be your own ego lookin' for an excuse
To plant roots, in a field of self-sorrow

To sprout and follow the first thing you feel
Nourishes your hunger to be respected, it gets hectic
And when I'm watchin' the news, and my daughter walks in
And choose to ask, 'Why were all those people on the floor
Sleepin', covered in red?' I told her
That they were lookin' for God, but found religion instead

Well I feel the world around me
I've found that others will bring you down, just to be down
You see, you've got to make up yo' mind, where you want to be
And where you want to go with yo' life
With your life, with your life

Oh, bring you down
Sometimes, you got to walk alone, alone
Oh, yeah, I need, ooh, to breathe
I need my space, to live
Y'all know, y'all know, oh

Well I, feel the world around me
I've found that others will bring you down just to be down
You see, you've got to make up yo' mind, where you want to be
And where you want to go with yo' life
With your life, with your life",Held Down,2001

Man, please tell him to stop bein' so dramatic
Just take a hit and let the weed do the trick

But will this make me sick

Come on, quit actin' like a bitch
I can blaze the weed and you can make excuses
Now ya gonna smell the smoke, my greenest weed produces
You'd probably like the smell too, ya probably wouldn't admit it
You'd probably want to hit too (Come on man quit it)
Ya clearly in denial (Yo this shit ain't my style)
How do you know come on, let us give you a trial

Need and can't call, carry the ball

Hold it down like the digital who stitched the hood
Better yet the whole globe, light it up like a strobe

Leave ya shit redder than Mars

I'm bout to have fun without the problems that live with me
Not tryin' to be posh, but lets stay out the mosh pit
Tonight keep my nose out of trouble
Everybody in my bubble's been breifed:
NO BEEF, JUST PARTY!
Of course your gonna have some clown niggaz try to
take us off course
Always lower levels tryin' to bring out the devil in us
Not condoned but its known
That a party ain't a party if the thugs don't try to shut it down!
Tight security and its still soft
Can't offset the thirty or plus caught in the rush
Keep the door sealed
Cause the floor's filled with action and we don't need
any distractions tonight ya'll.

Although I know we've seen enough of good days and dirt
You cut me just to nurse me back but damn I'd understand it
You gave ya all and I just gave it up
Put the truck in ya name
Damn ya should've known I was liability
Ignorin' the ways you would dress for a nigga
Express to a nigga I heard jibber and jabber
My apologies I left the wrong man to conduct
Take these jewels for the inconvience and neglect
You expect the worst of it
But I realize that I owe you more than explanation
 
I got my life in a box, what I'm supposin' is a joint account
It's cash on it, let's take our lil' business and incorporate it
It's me and you girl

[Chorus]

First of all love, your soul caller
Before me helped create and shape your distorted image
See every man don't play or even scrimmage
That's a lie but I'm try to be that only one
You look to, to make you smile
First you need to check my files
Understand I play the partners stereotypical man
An regret the pain I may have left to flame
My people say 'Yo that's a fine girl ya mess with'
But I told em' we havin' a mess
Ya charm must have calluses from the grip
That it has on my heart that I ain't tryin' to rip
But by now we both should know
That it's no longer where ya at but where we tryin' to go
So do ya background checks so I can pass through these borders
And stamp my name on a lil' man or a daughter
Come on girl

De La Soul,"[intro: A friend's voicemail to Dave]
Dave, whattup man?
It's me
Umm.. just callin to see, if possible, if you have any
Time today or within the next couple of days
If, if, you're in the studio.. or if you're at home.. or car, whatever
That song.. that.. it's called trying or something, Mase
Was tellin me that I needed to hear?
He said it was amazing
Whoo.. the way he was talkin.. man I want to hear it!

[Dave]
Am I just another lost in the pack?
We for shack ship, you know laugh it off
Years just blow by
My eyes stay fixed but the picture's kinda outta focus
I cry a lot but admit to it
Enjoyin life now but I've been through it
Sometimes I wish that I can go back
No bills no kids just getting tore back
I want a wife, I love women
How could I front like I don't be in love wit em?
A li'l man that I can teach
A li'l sand but not the beach
I figure excess'll only bring an excessive amount of fussin
So when I'm gone, make sure the head stone reads, 'He did it for us'
I'm like your modern day Jesus
I cherish warm thoughts like a gray goose
And float soft kisses to my baby
(yo ain't that Dave's little girl?)
Yeah, respect her for that
She gon be somebody
Instead of somebody-baby-mama
You see young minds are now made of armor
I'm tryin to pop a hole in your Yankee cap
Absorb me
The skies over your head ain't safe no more
And Hip Hop ain't your own
And if it is then you fuckin up the crib son
You make life look like I don't want to live one
You might as well hold your breath until you die in a
Corner somewhere bent over in the crevice
This God Theory overcomes the worst of weathers
As long as you willin to try, you on a good start homie
.. you on a good start.. see nigga tryin

[Chorus: Dave & Children]
[Dave] People are you ready?
[Children] Yes we're ready!

Are you really ready?
We want to be ready!

Ready for the change that may approach you?
Yes!

Follow down the path that you supposed to?
Yes!

People are you ready?
Yes we're ready! 

Are you really ready to try?
We want to try harder!

You know mistakes are trials that we learn from?
Yes!
I order to live life, you must earn one?
Yes!

People are you ready?
[Pos]
Throughout my change to grow, Some of my people got left behind
They didn't listen for the gun, as I leaped from off the line
Thirteen years deep in this marathon I'm runnin
Paid dues and still got bills to pay
When I came back around the way
Old friends gave me dead eyes
And fake smiles, half wide
We were supposed to rid the world of danger
These days we nod heads and small talk like polite strangers
It's natural to fall off, just land close to the tree
I'll be there if they need me to be
And I know all my local shorties
'cause they all know who I am
And latey want to flip grammar instead of grams 
Like that's the only choice they got
They tell me how they gonna shake up the game
But came to me to see if I could give em guidance for change
Shit why'all, I need guidance myself
And I chisel right words to make gems
Got fans around the world, but my girl's no one of em
And my relationship's a big question
'cause my career's a clear hindrance to her progression
Said she needs a man and our kids need a father
I'm not at all ready to hear her say don't bother
And break
And this I know I can't take
But uhh
C. Smith said to hold on
My brother Luck said to hold on
My nigga Dave said to hold on
My nigga Mase said to hold on
Yo, Maseo, we need to hold on
Eh, yo, why'all we need to hold on

[Chorus: Pos & Children]
[Pos] People are you ready?
[Children] Yes we're ready!

Well, what you want to be?
We want to be ready!

Do you want to lose hate for love?
Yes!

Do you want to see these gates above?
Yes!

I said people are you ready?
Yes we're ready!

But are you willing to try?
We want to try harder!

Do you really want to carry some weight?
Yes!

Are you ready to design your fate?
Yes!

Yo, people are you ready?
Yes we're ready!

Well what you want to be?
We want to be ready!..

You find me at the helm
Still standin' like abandoned buildings
In the southern part of BX, can old school it like a T-Rex
Ya well advanced connect dance with thoughts
Deep like Barry White's throat box
I bet you those cops mix
Double high tower my power grants me the chicks
The blows the cars and enemies that want to spar
You want to see it no matter who you are
Yeah I'm bound to ground you like that
Put they ass on a mound and introduce em' to a baseball
Face tall, brag about it like teenage sex

Got my pockets lookin' like I'm rockin' Popeye jeans
Classic like Reuben and Rah
One nigga under the groove we shootin' for that Parliament high
Plus bigger than the fourth of July
Take the back seat drive out
Hey yo, hey yo ain't nothin' street about me more like a light post
Sinin' above all who are why'all to boast
Stayed calm and all came to me to host
My vocab grabs many, long to cultivate raps
It's gettin' filled moms jack penny
It used to be unknown around the way
Now my bix became a bouqet
Every nose in it, fillin' up seats like a session in a Senate
Been a minute since ya heard the souls
So the soul gon' cost ya three
All ya people want to front like the soul don't hold control
But it don't mean shit to me
Plain to see that a song like this been what ya all missed
Come on, genuine adrenaline from off the wrists
We run the interference throughout the game clout
Can't be denied the bout for the title
Throw up ya guns and hold the pose like an idol
Bring it back to the draw
Ghosts of grand wiz Theodore
Played dirty with ever since played on the floor
Stop verbal assaults just in case a war break out
Steal vaults bigger than giraffes
But they still got a lot for me
Heard em' say a lot of nigga with the underground
They'd die for the underground but ain't makin' no money

Complete with yellow hair and Cinderella dress on

Anyway, another dime I met one time
I'm kiiind, chick in the world, butt fine
And her, structure pumpin, told her
Gotcha mumblin bout
""Slow down, what you tryin to rupture somethin?""

[Posdnuos]
I don't bug out, I chill
Never copped a feel
But these pretty ass girls come and flaunt in the grill
Big ass eyes, with the matchin big ass thighs
Asked her if she spare a moment to exchange some lies
""But you got a girlfriend""

[Slick Rick]
Yah trick, so do you
And I heard there's no preference in what gender ya do

So stop playin so squeaky clean
And let the dirty side see me later
So we can play 'away from the navy'

So stuck on the love you rearranging behaviors
Second episode, and you returnin oral favors
Buyin up groceries
Searchin for hosiery
Holdin hands publicy
And now you supposed to be
Mr. and Mrs. huh, lovin and kisses huh?
But while you away is when the milkman'll visit her
Dear to the heart, we dearly depart the fallen
So skip the games ma, I stay tuned to the calling

We run a hard bargain
Pardon the trip

I sneeze jealousies into these rhyme cartel
We park the art well
Hung on all fours, box and start sell
Available to you and yours

Other songs only make attempts
To love they inner
Understand I am just saying it
To validate displaying Ozomatli

It's like the train
Brought to hit you like James
With the 1, 2, 3, 4

Official souls my brainchild
Sing the song name now

Bust a track till they flat on they back
Have the referee smacking the mat like

We do it on the phone
When we stuff the funk in it, huh

Now wait a minute, so allot of us
Yo, I'm the East Coast south paw
Hanging with these West Coast north stars
Shining bright, height five elev'

Come on

Formatic for the handlin' the trouble
Comin' my way
The highway to heaven
Is a long road among the lyrical coves
The bus

Allot of us
Punk minds with the one of a kind rhymes
I .M.C., spit, kick for fee
Then all, not the player baby
But I running while you crawl

Too fast on your comprehension
Did I mention
Dave Madden scored a goal from the team
Second team I

I'm ready for crunch time
The lunch line was my favorite
Till I graduated to bus
Uh, uh, then I spewed to spit it

Now it's the three of us
Connected like Siameses
We on time
Like shiny bits of metal

Strapped to your wrist
We are tattoo to this rap thing
With invisible ink
I'm gone in a blink

Lethal like my pinkie
And clown like Bozo
Don't you know that Ozo bring the
1, 2, 3, 4

To hard to face
But lovin' the taste
Squeeze it out like paste alright

De La Soul,"We are here to tell the world just who we are
Shocking female (MC's), shocking female (MC's) (Repeat 2x)

Verse 1: Phife

No need for, introductions, cause I know you know my name and
Knocking MC's out the frame and, putting them suckers to shame and
I live for hip-hop, so I have no time for fun and games and
So just come and peep the unique styles we are displaying
The beat's just ridiculous, the lyrics articulate
Feels good, as if a girl just touched her (tits)
Sucker MC's, I'm killing 'em, I'm so sick of seeing 'em
Silly (shit) when they rhyme, like that red rugby shirt worn by Gilligan
Plus the hat, they (shit) is wack
When you see me coming take ten steps back
I make usage of the pronouns, adjectives, verbs
My granny says ""You always had a way with words""
And that's because my word is bond, lyrics are laws
Sucker MC's look at me like I'm friggin' eye sore

Verse 2: Posdnuos

Heere comes a brother hipping others on the style they lack
I've always rhymed abstract, I even know the brother named Abstract
I am the earner of the soul in mine
Forget the physical cause the physical will die with time
I'm shaped to vibrate in definite proportions
Of the kids who need the fix (Just listen to the mix)
I just imagine constant non-stop for the rubbishing
Like (niggas) use the Clinton loops as if they owned the publishing
Ducks be bleeding from illegal feeding on my verb
I bring the Mardi Gras to your face
I outwit vipers in my rhyme cipher
I can easily lick them cause they're victims of the subconscious race
Tossing periods in front of false reps?
It's not the 187 when the 360 slept
You swallow the cake from the plate of elevate
Or you might get sparked by the crew who got the weight
So recessitating rap like the hicks do with Presley
It's the kid who peed the jeans in Orleans off of Nesley
Just be MC number nine, if you let me rhyme nine times infinitely I will
Climb
I let my Walkman from Sony play cassettes from Raboni
Which guarantees to put me on the narrow road
Ayo, that's it from me, Plug 3, and Ali explode!

Verse 3: Q-Tip

When I rhyme, the effect just ripples
You sound sick, I hope your cells get sickles
You formulate into real stiff (shit)
Then I bet that it cut the chit chit
Cause the Ab will, be sharper than a Ginsu
Cutter or your bum (ass) head for the gutter
This is not a game and we ain't looking for the fame
That ain't the aim, we came to rip the jam out the frame
My inter-reaction with paper is amazing
So needless to say mad trails are left blazing
A whole lot of bull(shit) rhymes start to get play
But I'm here to say real rhymes to pay
I'm the type of brother that writes until my knuckles get nary
And through the domepiece, the rhymes will carry
Then transported to my throat then the quotes hit the air
As I stand dipped with the wares
Rhymes get slot times, move back from the jack
It's the verbal constructor, some MC's is wack
I make a girl do the bogle, doo doo brown and all
Make (niggas) jump up, drink Don, and have a ball
I ainimate the unlively with the verbal combat
The Abstract, never the wack
Motivator of the many like Moses
Moving through, bringing games into the dummies that pose us
That means you the sub relator of the sub culture
Like a vulture I swoop down on crowns, cause confusion all around
Mental burdens I bring to MC's who sing
They sad songs, money, the dough's not long
Mine on the other hand is lent me tight
The Abstract gets real, real, real

Verse 4: Dove

Real down to Earth I hit the Long Island Rail
You never see me tango with the horn and the tail
I got the kid for your mind I design it like sender
Smoking made hope from my neighbors, and the
50/50 luck takes the ""S"" off my chest
Cause the ""S"" on my chest makes a mess
Settling for Superman, stupid man, put on your glasses
Now your (ass) be slow guessing like molasass
Continue the menu, next on the platter
Hey where that (bitch) at? (He's right here boy!)
I gotta see what I got and who I'm getting it with
This ain't no nickle dime game that I'm peddling with
Mikie Rose said ""Stop riding, it be dividing
Taking me out how I be vibing""
Packing hard like pistol but my pops got the crystal
Told me if I ever need it just *whistle*
Respects to Griff Dog for the razor
Much respects to Joe but for the favor
It's about a million brothers trying to make it in this world
I'm glad I got a baby girl

Waiting for the credit card so she can go and shop
Jack plays the back, just knockin' other socks
'Cause now in the hood he's 'Johnny The Fox'

Till one ring came, Jody blew a spark
Found about Jody round the corner in the park
Flipping like a dipstick, hip to the news
Practicing the range, bellowing the blues

Jack rolls the carpet in, swift like a skate
Yo, Jody, yo, gotta go, got a date
Padlock Jody's screaming, ""Wait, wait, wait""
""Don't worry, hon,"" he replies, ""I'm keepin' the faith""

I'll never do the baseball with you again
Yo, I'll never do the baseball with you
'Cause your hoochie-coo was so smooth
Was it such a sin to let, let me in?

Hooked by your ever-so-shyness
Want that bush, heard you're from Flatbush
Ran after ya, caught ya
Brought ya to Long Island, stylin' for a while

In my hut, I was on a cut for a peck, a silly Greg Peck
You tried to play me new, Plug One you disconnect
I'd try to touch your hair, you would say no
Yo, I'd try to touch your hair, you would say no

Is it 'cause you want my financial flaunt?
First you gotta please me, nice and easy
But I guess you want that in reverse
So I stand Plug First can see

We got a serious block
Turn the other way, ooh, what do I spot?
A hoopin' Hey Love whose scent left a trace
Had a stash in her pocket with a body that's safe

Ball to the eight, now you wanna swing?
Forget the rap, yo, Black Sheep, sing

You're banned, you're banned
You're banned, honey dip, you're banned
You're banned, you're banned

Ya banned by the preacher man
You played yourself a stew
Now to me you step, never mind love
The faith is being kept

Now remember 'bout Padlock Jody, here's the fact
Jack little wick but she was acting wack
Jack wanna lay but laying ain't exact
For the past four or five she was banned by the pack

Hip to the witness, putting on a plan
No money, no more Puddy Tat for the man
Jack knows that honey means playing a game
Only wanna bowl, got nabbed for the fame, goddamn

Sam was the man that you planned to command
Nothing new about a neighborhood
You know what? Padlock Jody wanna cut
Jack's thinking cap, make mine into a pack

Yo, here's twenty, forty, sixty, pay me back
Conscience appears, ""Yo Jack, what you doing?""
You play the cold while honey here's cooling?
You don't have to if you don't want to
You don't have to if you don't want to""

So he begins with the ring, ring, ring
""Hey, Judy girl, how ya doin'
Seen you with another man, what you doing, screwing?
Ooh, shame on you, what, you can't wait
For the big bait, well, I'm ma tell you straight

De La Soul,"Now let's get right on down to the skit
A baby is brought into a world of pits
And if it could've talked that soon
In the delivery room
It would've asked the nurse for a hit
The reason for this?
The mother is a jerk
Excuse me, Junkie
Which brought the work of the old
Into a new light
What a way
But this what a way
Has been a way of today
Anyway
Push couldn't shove me to understand a path to a basehead
Consumer should erase it in the first wave
But second wave forms believers
And believers will walk to it then even talk to it and say...
(You got the body now you want my soul)
Nah, can't have none of that, tell 'em what to say Mase...

SAY NO GO

Nah, no my brother
No my sister
Try to get hip to this
Word, word to the mother
I'll tell the truth so bear my witness
Fly like birds of a feather
Drugs are like Pleather
You don't wanna wear it
No need to ask that question, just don't mention
You know what the answer is

Now I never fancied Nancy
But the statement she made held a plate of weight
I even stressed it to Wade

Did he take any heed?

Nah, the boy was hooked, you could've phrased the word ""Base""
And the kid just shook
In his fashion class once an A now an F
The rock rules him now
The only designs left
Were once clothes made for Oshkosh
Has converted to nothing but stonewash

Now hopping in a barrel is a barrel of fun
But don't hop in if you want to be down, son
Cause that could mean down and out as an action
What does it lead to?
Dum-da-dum-dum
People say what have I done for all my years
My tears show my hard-earned work
I heard shoving is worse than pushing
But I'd rather know a shover than a pusher
Cause a pusher's a jerk

SAY NO GO

Believe it or not the plot forms a fee more that charity
But the course doesn't coincide with the ride of insanity
Is it a chant that slants the soul to fill for it?
I know it's the border that flaunts the order to kill for it

Standing, scheming on a young one
Taking his time, eight-ball for a cool pool player
Racked it all, tried to break, miscued
Got beat by the boy in blue
Next day you're out by the spot once more
Looking hard for a crack in the hole
I ask what's the fix for the ill stuff
Word to the Dero
The answer should have been no

Run me a score from the Funky Four Plus One More
(It's the joint!)
Rewind that back
This is the age for a new stage of fiend
Watch how the zombies scream
It's the crack
Plain is plain it should explain it from the start
Behind the ideals of cranking up the heart
Now the base claim's shot over every part

DON""T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT

SAY NO GO

De La Soul,"And now for my next number
I'd like to return to the classics
Perhaps the most famous classic
In all the world of music

The first time around you didn't quite
Understand our new style of speak
(Don't worry, we can fix that right now)
So, why don't you all just grab your bags?
(Come on aboard, hoist the anchor and we'll be off)

Plug one, plug two, plug one, plug two
Plug one, plug two, plug one

Answering any other service
Prerogative praised, positively I'm acquitted
Enemies publicly shame my utility
After the battle they admit that I'm with it

Simply soothe, will move vinyl like glue
Transistors are never more shown with like
When vocal flow brings it all down in ruin
Due to a clue of a naughty noise called, 'Plug tunin''

Flock to the preacher called Pos
Let him be the stir to the style of your stew
Sit while the kid of the plug form aroma
Then grab a daisy to sip your favorite brew

Lettin' this soul fire be your first prior
But don't let the kick drum stub your big toe
See that the three will be your thread
But like my man Chuck D said, ?What a brother know?

Dance while I play and the cue cards sway
From my flower girls China and Jette
The button is pressed in '89 we'll start the panic
From De La Soul and a prince from stet

Negative noise will be all divided
Dangerous to dance, Posdnuos will croon
Ducks and kizids will all be rid
When paying position to the naughty noise called, 'Plug tunin''

Plug one, plug two, plug one, plug two
Plug one, plug two, plug one, plug two

Freeze, 'cause these are the brothers
Brothers of the soul who present a new flick
Every last viewer is tuned to the method
Known to be a method, no magicians, not a trick

Bitten by the spoken who been titled plug two
Swallowed by the loonies who are jealous with the showbiz
Dove'll teach the truth, Posdnuos will preach the youth
To the fact that this will bring an end to the negative

Flow to the sway 'cause I say, ?Fa So La Ti?
At the top we will dwell
Difference is fame and we rise then we build
Where we are set we get fat and we swell

Motions of the soul is a positive stride
One step forward is the space we consume
Vivid as the moon, you have yet to assume
How the soul found the motto of a naughty noise called, 'Plug tunin''

Vocal is local so believe that
This chant shan't rely on the strong lap
Trying and live so you best realize
That the gift that I present, I say gift wrap

Style of the tune is personal
And defining what's the rhyme is worst of all
Stop, sit and study 'cause the meaning isn't muddy
Just preach and do the gear as the first of all

Watch while the pitcher is pitching
'Cause this is the pitch of the year
Sing a simple song but keep the swing strong
Though you heard dove crying 'I ain't fair'

Those who think De La's on the flip tip
Try to flip this and you're doomed
Watch for the be be, 'cause if you try to grieve me
You'll be hung by the wire of the plug tune

I can't twist your arm and make you stay with me

Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should it's all on you

I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been through and paid my dues
Can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all on you-whoahhha-ohh-yeah

I wish that, you could be a little bit more upfront
Weigh the situation how you want right
The lovin' that you claim is just a four letter word
The third letter's invitin' so visualize the verb

You curve thoughtways when you're handlin' the candleabra
So you sittin' on the baby grand
Transmittin' like you're made of man
But you paint a funny face like a chick
When I see you I'ma tell you quick that

[Unverified]

I can't believe we built this large pizza pie together no pepperoni
Yeah, you wanted extra cheese, sometimes I gave you extras
How we divided slices like the Red Sea theory
I was Moses hopelessly scorned by your thorn zapora

Tried to bring that fairy-tale life, you wanted horror
But my microscope couldn't see or cope with that
I had to bolt from that, and left you dead in the sea
It's better for me, I'm satisfied with reppin' for D

We were certified hot, then dropped to lukewarm
Now we back up in the spot, claimin' never been gone
Niggaz who cut us off, wanna reattach us now
(Them girls who brushed us off, say they want some [unverified] to dial)

Yeah, I give that ass a number and some lumber to pile
Now catch a curve from my kick
(Or show me lovin' by brick)
So stick to the same plan, don't come shakin' my hand
Like we peeps, it ain't beef but be sure to understand
Between us, it ain't all

Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan

You see them kids be schemin' on what we done copped
Always out there schemin'
They steady fiendin' for the moment they can get us off the block
Why they always fiendin'?

Your people might have your back
But you need to watch your front
Indeed, ain't nothin' guaranteed
That's the truth, things ain't goin' like you think they should

A lot say they wanna walk in my size 10's
Aight then, here's a pair
Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me
You see ain't no young boys up in here, keep a clear head

Tryin' to keep my pockets on stuffed like deer heads
Upon the wall, so all the gall we get from y'all don't faze
So mind your biz and walk away
'Cause I'm never gonna let you up inside my maze

I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been there and paid my dues
I can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all, on you-whoahha-ohh

And not the weak
Let me inherit the street, fuck it
You know what I mean?
I mean I love life man, you know what I mean
Life is beautiful, it's just the shit in it that's fucked up
It's rough but it's fair
People gotta go out there and bust they, bust they ass for a job
I mean, my dad's got five kids, man and I mean yo
He hates drivin' a bus but he loves five kids
You feel me?

I'm a rhyme artist
Out here tryin' to grind my hardest
Up early so to milk the cow
Keep my John Deere out here plowin' the fields
To keep my john hancock's worth up in the now
Went from hangin' on blocks to hangin' on charts
Positions is part of my mission to hangin' on top
Gotta get your polly cracker or with them crackers
And them scheisty ass niggas if you like it or not
I've been rewired to work more efficiently in the dirt
I'm hands on with it all up in my cuticles
Some try to get off the farm but fell into harm
Of getting in the game of those street pharmaceuticals
But, I was raised in those blue collar themes
Havin' white collar dreams cause I see what it means
And though the meek shall inherit the earth but don't forget
The poor are the ones who inherit the debt
You can bet I got better things to do than that
I was a dick who got jerked by Tom and his boys
Came on my land, seized my cattle, and catalog
As if it wouldn't leave me less than coy
But I'm far from bitter even farther from quittin'
Got a grind date to make, no time for sittin'
And playin' Xbox, stand up and exercise my rights
As of by seen of through master's eye
It's the grind date
Know what I'm sayin? I'm sick of askin' that
I mean, the street philosophy is that
I'm gonna milk the cow and cook the meat
At least I'm gonna have some kind of food and drink
Because sometimes you can't come back
Like momma said that if you need 5 cents don't ask for 3
Ask for 10, that's for sure

Yo fuck a rhyme artist, I ain't here for that
I was born with the boom bap, respect the name
My hands on experience was hands on my first contract
Taught me quick how to respect the game
Introduced to the block, got used to the block
But your neighbors be the ones who throw shit on your lawn
It's like every single time we pop, they got annoyed
But we got ahead, and we got along
And puttin' work on the calendars, worse on them calendars
Worth of hump days that broke the camel's back
The grind'll make today look gray
And paint a tainted picture of tomorrows in enamel black
Meet the rhyme, street grind, son whatever the beast
I'm a take it at the horns till the pinky toe torn
And show you why we here this long
Cause when it comes to puttin' in work
Once again it's on

I'm just like everybody else man
An average nigga with above average potential
You know what I mean? I'm not sayin' that I'm a gentleman
I'm saying that I know how to act like a gentleman
In order to get the things that I need
And if I gotta pull out my nickle bag, I'm gonna do that
This ain't no accident, we stayin' here
You damn right I am proud of myself man
And I'm proud of my team man
I don't want you to get the wrong, yo baby on the real?
I don't have sex with people I do business with neither
And that's the real
But I do do business with people that I have sex with

Hey yo, wake up! 
Wipe the sleep from ya eye cracks
It's time to focus y'all, fix ya I-MAX
In other words, listen to the brother's words
Ingest these anecdotes with hope!
And ya ass, may learn how to cope!
It's not always good just to get by
Who's coverin' ya stakes when ya bet high?
You're cha-sin', cars, clothes and rocks
Identify with the goods you got
Make sure it's V-S-One, not
And perfect, leavin' you one clear
I really don't care to see ya tattoos there
I'd rather see you graduate the school year
Black folk, go put a book in ya face
But first give the hook a taste
Bring the preacher in!

Heal! Heal, y'all!
We comin' healin'! {It's real!}
It's real! {It's real!} It's real!
It's realer than real, realer than real

It's a sick world that we live in, let some tell it
Some put it in books, some yell it
You need to make your own choice, be your own voice
Set ya soap-box up, let your talk fight
Pull ya socks up, get ya walk right
Or the chalk might outline ya one day
You oughta try steppin' outside you one day
You circle round yourself like you the answer
To the question of your inner son
But keep ya falsehoods to a minimum (minimum)

We all need a little church
A life update, keyword, update
If they don't serve change, don't bite the bait
Instead of givin' you a share, servin' you a dish
I lead you to the water, show you how to fish
Ain't nothin' wrong makin' that bread wid'it
But don't let the bread get to ya head, geddit?
Admit it, when you can't stand alone
I want to stand up, give all the pretend up
And get a full blast of my demands of
The rhyme runner said the man's come
There's something in our words that reveal (reveal)
Sure 'nough real!

Heal y'all! We come to heal!
So let it heal you!(It's real!) It's real!

Heal y'all! We gonna heal it!
So let it heal! (It's real!) It's real!
(It's real!) So real!
It's realer than real, for real, for real

The early bird gets the worm in this rotten apple
But explore deep and you will the find the seed
Plant more ether, get your mind free
We roll passionate, put your lights last in it
You're holding fear too close, unfasten it!
And like old age invades youth
Invade falseness with truth
Replace rebelling with rebirth
Face new dwelling, that's your turf
Lean back and put your feet up on the sofa
Relax! (Relax!) learn how to punch back
And do your work to the max
The payoff's much sweeter than the payback
Even the hay sack needle wouldn't play that
So let's pray at, church (church)

You know what I mean? Rap outsold crack
You know, so rap, or hip-hop culture
However you want to dice it, you know what I'm sayin'
It's the most powerful drug there is, man
It changed corporate America, it changed the way you feel about me
It change the way I, I do my thing now

De La Soul, is now back on the map
Long Island, is now back on the map
Good rap music, is now back on the map
Yo check one two, this is the voice of yours truly the Flava Flav
And I just want y'all to know, we ain't goin nowhere
Old school is here to stay boy!

On the outskirts, of what works
Live those who go for broke, and merk to get merked
Live by the sword and die by the semi
Not part of my ways, but stays right in my
N.Y. mentality for me to be the best
The current, the ones who weren't
pressed, to confess lies over hot joints
to sell to all who want to hear some
(Young'uns these days got fireproof eardrums!)
They don't give a SHIT who's hot
Just long as you're not, pussy, and be the would-be King
But once crowned, the same want to pull you down
(And what makes the world go 'round!!)
And I be the world renowned Wonder Why
Wonderin why you can't stand me
Is it because I'm the main Jackson
and y'all just Titos and Randys? (Yes, it is!)
Bless the kid who hold his own head and expect to last
At the same time, I want respect and cash
And a few paragraphs in them books
Tellin you how us Native Tongues made hits with no hooks
Rapped in every prefixes, gave birth to rap remixes back in '88
No disrespect to Diddy just settin it straight
Instead of zig-zaggin', got a degree in braggin
My daughter says I'm a teen, cause like a teen
my pants always saggin and I walk with a bop
The {?} part of my time, I walked from my pop
No longer on timey and was never on Loud
But cooked rhymes that make the Chefs of Wu proud
I'm top cloud to rain on your show
And still ""anything goes when it comes to hoes"" because

Had bottom inner drawers and used to hit it from the mids
Fix your playground player or some kids'll

No knives, no drama, no guns
No disrespectin' your seed or Ma Dukes
I puke rhyme and you laugh, take a sniff
of these fricaseed raps on Caribbean riffs
See last night's change was today's dough money
No time for your freestyles so roll money
No more whack albums with two joints
No more ballplayin' rappers who shoot ya two points
(No more G cause I'm sick of your hip-hop!)
Your flows bore like seashores with no bitches
Switchhittin' niggaz will receive no pitches
No diamonds on the field, just keep the game real
simple, see the God flows healthy
Wealth in the mind is like money in the bank
Exchange cash like thoughts in conversation
Thank you for your purchases, we dough out
and roll out the cool-Aid, {?} see us pimp strut
Ain't really pimpin', I'm tryin' to catch the bus
The Krush Groove ain't got shit on Cold Crush!
We dolly dolly babies cause we shootin' cats
'Back to the Future' rap with Doc Brown shotgunnin' it
And pantyhose your whole style and start runnin' it
You dudes fiddle while we stay on the cello
The mush-in-your-room son, we stay portobello
Can't settle for the same picket white fence
I got dreams of barbed wire in front of factories pa

]Yo how the days of your life go Com? (I'm just tryin' to be)
That's it? (Stayin' focused so my mind is free)
Watch the problems of the world go by like balloons

Too soon?

I want the boom in the back of the truck
Ain't nuttin' the matter with a good dude havin' a buck
With that on my mind, I'm on the grind, it pays
We break it down in these three ways, yo

These days, I travel the Maze like Frank Beverly
To the East, lookin' for pieces of a better me
Responsibility of my man's felony fell on me
Celebrity status, make 'em think I got celery

Hell and I do sometimes, still the sunshine ain't even all day
(Yeah) The life of a baller, ain't even all play
I stack 'em, so the chips fall where they must
I ain't far from a Benz, or dude on the bus

Even when I don't have enough, still in God I trust
Said baby you're a star
Said I'm on the car, seen the jiggiest of stars
Become dust, and one love become lust for the papers
Had you gassed now that - gas became vapors
Tricked your cash on ice; shoulda had acres
Now your, empire fell like the Lakers
So you're talkin' to your maker

It's the nature of the business, they givin' niggaz inches
Takin' miles and mules, it's the wildest rules
I'm tryin' to walk in the black scent of proudest shoes
Makin music that the crowds can use

[Chorus: ]
Yo how the days of your life go Dave? (With sunshine and shade)
That's it? (Tinted window grades and Kool-Aid)
Watch the problems of the world go by like balloons
If tomorrow come now (that might be too soon)
Too soon?

I want twenty-four plus on these
Put the Pinto engine and the bus on these
I get that first class seat to escape the days
We break it down in these three ways

Check the life I got that antidote, cantelope scent, bent back
In the sunroom froze, put your flick on pause (and pop a cork)
There's no occasion nigga it's just because
I'm celebratin' for a hell of a day

Get these barbie filets on hot charcoal tracks, so black
Darko Pecoltrane plays them back
We them freedom fight kids who gon' ball and raise fists
If y'all down for the struggle, c'mon y'all, resist

Everyday script, I exercise cheek
Sixteen on the bar, I exercise speak (ha)
It's been a long time, Long Isle's on the map
While y'all stand on the corner, stoned like Chris Back
Kiss back, watchin' time - wrist back
Every second count but just finish this lap
You gamble on your life like casino slots
And cash out and still walk with a knot

[Chorus: ] 
Yo how the days of your life goes Merce? (Man I'm just holdin' my head)
That's it? (Shit, I'm also tryin' to hold this bread)
Watch the problems of the world go by like balloons
If tomorrow come now (that might be too soon)
Too soon?

I furnished the rooms, and mortgage on these
See them quittin' ass rappers caused a shortage on these
The soul boys of big illa-noyz get the praise
We break it down in these three ways

My moms died from secondhand smoke; so I wish yo' ass would die
From them secondhand rhymes you wrote
Or shall I call them second rhymes - written seconds 'fore you enter the booth
Words thrown together with very little truth
And a select few can do it (true) you ain't part of them scriptures
And got the nerve to feel you want me out the picture
But I was never in it, I'm the frame around the flick
Or dishin' in the mouth of your dame around my dick

Ladies and gentlemen, introducin' Workmatic
One of L.I.'s finest, and this is (my life)
Which is filled with bad minutes and good hours
And, good months and bad years and with my peers
We struggle to juggle the shit
Family life and the music game don't easily fit

My lady wants me home, sayin' rap tour three rap whores
And scores of scandal, even more than we can handle
Sometimes, the rhymes I say
Is the fly the currency to save the day
Can't turn it away, cause we out
To find presence way beyond our measure, so baby don't pout

Don't pout, De La Soul now turn it out
Don't pout, Common Sense'll turn it out
Don't pout..",Days of Our Lives,2004
De La Soul,"[Chorus:]
We are singing
You this message
Through our music 
Reaching for a, brave and brighter, new tomorrow 
Is the future
We must make it, safe and happy, for the children
Or...or...they will be lost
Or...or...they will be lost

Aiyyo I jump back, put the aim on my shot
It's mandatory, handle glory over with the rock
I'm not a rough guy but a tough guy to beat over drums
No son to this, I'm a rhyme bastard

Some mastered the art of cash, but not the part that lasts
And disappear after doin' two albums
We're not your normal team and we still do ours to fit
Hope inside this, don't define it's
Quits for those who oppose the new
Playin' they've outgrown rap, like a size 5 shoe
Oh they all neo now, alternative touch
Were surprised, no demise for us
We on the rise to bust big, how you fig' we couldn't
Never run out of verbs for you to sip, I told you we wouldn't
I never popped Crist' or popped fists, girl named Chrissie
Was the first, which made it even worse not to miss me

Or... or... they will be lost (the future)
Or... or... they will be lost (the future)

So do you understand it now?  Well try standin' over
Seven box sets, reppin' sixteen years
This rap career ain't work, it's the life in-between
Bedtime 'til the next said time and date
Know the name and salute them dudes
Put the nutrient in rap when they cook them foods
Gotta be like eighteen million heads served
Shit, imagine if there wasn't no us huh?

So I'd like to take the time to shout out the JB's
Next on my list is A Tribe Called Quest
Latifah my Queen, Monie Love, Dres and Mr. Lawnge
Chi-Ali, on your head God bless
Never ring chasin', the permanent tat
In this rap shit, y'all are just temporary lick-ons
Fadin' in the days to come

Down, like water, fresh out the clouds, clown.
Drown you like terrible weather.
Nobody does it better than I, so approved by Carly Simon.
Most rappers is real hard, but still hardly rhymin'.
To all - rise and shine; give God the glory.
I already give a percent of mine to Bert and Cory,
And still got bills and employees to pay.
So excuse me, Lord, we'll settle up towards the end of my days.
My ways of control is hard to swallow.
Known to lead, but some would rather see me follow behind.
Sorry to dis-appoint, but dis joint's mine.
Dis-play your indie, but say no more or I'll blind you like spit did to Remo.
To the dirt, and edit the clip and lost Kano.
My mens wear problems like Timbs.
See it all in they face; ask Mase, he got wars to win,
Scores to settle, crews to crush.
You rush right in to see him do it with a smile.
It's Long Isle y'all; longevity sustainin' my celebrity status.
From A-M to P-M, you see him on file, y'all.
I was told to step righteous, so when it's done
Everyone will say I stepped right.
And whether through religion, or stopped by the cop,
Shinin' his flash in my face, I'm bound to see the light.

""A few short words, and whaddya know?""
""Oh, whaddya know?  He comes.""

[Dave]
Aiyyo, I'm up against these walls; here's my back, stiff, straight up.
Dazzle and razzlin' broads like I'm little Juan Magic.
Magnetically handle mics, they don't drop.
Top drama every time these commas don't drop.
Pop spots like lint on your shirt; the net worth.
To shoot the rock homey in many courts of ball;
Four couldn't do it, so we bring all six.
I circumcise the track; you just a dick, overlapped and hooded.
Skin repeated like Stutterin' John.
I repeat like yesterday; it don't stop.
George of this poor life, pop, put to Scarlet;
In a place she believes much better than your lies.
She say she lookin' better in my eyes; bullshit!
Same crock she done ran to duck, crammin' to fuck.
I put the pudding on her like Bill Cosby.
I tried to speak my piece in court, but Judge Mills paused me.
Bifocusedly die, hopeless sometimes.
Yo, cry your poker face; you oughta try it one time.
When God is an non pos' you stand to download.
Demanded like slaves on trial; we want free.
Man, cock aim ready; it's time you MC.
So you rappers bust bibi guns; graffiti runs
Through my veins, since cable with the wired remote.
Woodgrainin' like you wired his float.

C'mon, Pretty Toney and De La Soul.
We was rhymin' through the frozen street since eight years old.
Take us back to eighty-eight; you couldn't catch our flow.

You heard?

[Ghostface Killah]
Tony 'Tana with big hammers for bad manners; who got 'em?
We kiss cannons for Scrangelous crew and his whack dancers.
Bitin' is forbidden, pah, pay that tax.
And don't you ever look at us funny, boy, we'll bring rap back.
And that'll hurt you like Superman, chased by a group of men.
With dyna-mics, real hip-hop'll do you in.
For you like Loo Goo Kim, or Moo Loo Inn.
Hula hoop all bitches; crew full with brand new Keds.
Cutmaster kill 'em; make sure we cut classics.
Buck bastards in broad day and tuck caskets.
Next to Uday and Qusay, how can the group shoot the P-A,
And just lay whooptay, whooptay?
Use the ruse, sport beads, and snatch a dude's toupee.
Since tunin' into T-La Rock'n A-J,
Ghostface gats is freshed squeezed, like a glass of O-J.
Girls, you can go cruisin' in my O-J.

It's like, New York without a New York yanks
Better yet, New York without the New York franks
It's like hot summers without no A.C
Or never hitting numbers when you go to A.C
It's like six years of your life, go ask Rob
I'm like ""Yo how is it?"" he like ""It's like hard""
Trying for that queen but you nothing but a man
You want to keep it clean but you can't
Why it gotta be, like, that
And what the life, see life is like a J shot
Shooters son, they got
One point one second, you half court
I'm feeling the adrenaline like you half court
Like pink slips and dipping these ink tips to paper
Imagine if we fuck around and lose Hip-hop
Imagine if it didn't exist
Imagine nothing shining your wrist
See, imagining to you is a risk
But think about it, like no chrome rims
And tims would be construction boots (ill)
We probably wouldn't even substitute (ill)
For words we use defining our likes
I'm coal mining these mics
To keep that gold nugget like Dave Megget
Giant like a motherfucker, like Dave said it
But ya ain't listening, ya paper gon' stack
Why it gotta be like that?

I'm trying to be a person but I gotta be the man
If I, can't stand the life that I'm in

It's like, one minute you got it, then you broke
Like what I do with it? I copped a few with it
Looking like a problem, but you won't get it solved
You working but you won't get the job
It's like, who would of thought (thought)
It you would of bought (bought)
Into my religion you'd be more like God
But you were steady swimming so you more like cod
See these fools is fish scale, converting to ish male
See I see it like, A alike, be	 alike
I was taught, if you play alike, be alike
How they don't see it for one to go pop
And this is how you treat Hip-hop?
Imagine if you didn't have that phantom chrome sitting on a curb nigga
The word nigga wouldn't be a bit disturbing nigga
See them roots are like begging for the rain
You entering my kingdom just a begging for the reign
Putting shit stain to paper
Ink pain feeling like fifty-five licks on a slave niggas back
And not a one of y'all stopping to hate
But why it gotta be like that?

Cold for your areas, flows come in various shapes and sizes
so hot that you despise it

Never last up to bat (no no no no)
These skills we don't lack (no no no no)
We never fall and pray (no no n-no no)
Make all the ladies say (oh oh baby)
You can't knock the hustle not at all (no no no no)
Can't be budged by your muscle (no no no no)
Never riding on E (no no n-no no)

Yo, if you are what you eat; some of you
cats heads between your girl's legs a lot cause y'all act too sweet
(Go brush your teeth!) Then after that
Put in a little more practice on your rhyming attack
What you write's not the least bit hot
Maybe cause your wrist is so cold from all that ice you cop
Hate to hate a player but you know what?
I still smother ya like cheese and rocking leaves freshly cut

[Butta Verses]
And we the steak and potatoes and De La's the greatest
And ladies be on the floor thanking the Lord that He made us
I'm telling you, I swoop her like a pelican do
You saying look at that pelican fly, you spitting gelatin rhymes
They shaky as shit, ugly in the mold you fit
We the square peg on the round hole, sound's soulful
Your imitation flavor is tofu
It's true we make our bed all day, and we are

[Posdonus]
the world of rap! Take you back
in the days of all four hundred ways that people lack
It's that (what) authentic, big-nosed mic music 
Four to five survive all night to it
I'm trying to keep up with my Jones' and Thomas'
'til I'm broke like them New Year's Eve promises
And that's alright, I just penned another sixteen
to fill my bank account with the mixed greens

De La Soul,"Up in them five-star tellies and two mic rhymes
Be them average MC's of the times
Unlike them, we craft gems
So systematically inclined to pen lines
Without sayin a producer's name, all over the track
Yeah I said it!  What you need to do is get back
To reading credits, we them medics
Alphabetically stuck on that english
And knock it out before we pour
That sure shot more rock co.kane flow

From the top of the key, the 3 Villain
Been on in the game as long as you can wheelie your Schwinn
Turn the corner spinnin, bust that ass and get up
Dust off the mask, whoever laugh give him a head up
He got jumped, it pumped his adrenaline
He said it made him tougher than a bump of raw medicine
To write all night long, the hourglass is still slow
Flow from Hellborn to Free Power like Wilco
And still owe bills, pay dues forever
Slay huge when it comes to who's more cleverer
Use to wore a leather goose ski with a fur collar
Hand charged a fee for loose leaf words for dollar
Ya heard?  Holla - broad or dude, we leave food
Eat your team for sure, the streets sure seem rude
For fam like the Partridges, pardon me for the mix-up
Battle for your Atari cartridges or put your kicks up
It's a stick up

Now put your blix up, these Riddick Bowe cuts
Is swoll like penile flicks, give 'em 20
The danger in his eyes'll let you know he's a brawler
Bring your tallest champs like that much taller
Ten pounds heavier, one step ahead of it
Vocab, stamina, style's all irrelevant
Camps and cliques, units, squad crews and clans
Even your tongues'll fuck around and leave your mouth

Doom brung that bum, there goes that news van again
Act like you knew like Toucan Sam an' 'em
He eat rappers like part of a complete breakfast
Your rhymes ain't worth the weight of they cheap necklace
String 'em up, bring 'em up under whack junk snack
And get that out your hand, punk, jump and get your dunk smacked
Foul, we all know the rules bro
You slow, you blow the soup on your fools, his Impulse like Yugo

You go lights, camera, action with no makeup
We De La to the death, or at least until we break up
Here's a couple of nice guys who finished first
So nice try, but the prize is ours dispersed
They say the good die young, so I added some
Bad-ass to my flavor to prolong my life over the drum
Everyone cools off from bein hot
It's about if you can handle bein cold or not!
And we was told to hop for no one, s'what I dig bout Prince Paul
We stayed original ever since y'all
First to do a lot of things in the game, but the last to say it
No need to place it on a scale to weigh it
And don't do it for the plays or to raise the bar
Yet it's raised anyway, it's so amazing, are
The three L.I. brothers from a other way of thinkin
Hey your lady's winkin, I think you need to control that aura
Or I can hold her

The elements are airborne, I smell the success
(Yo let's cookie cut the shit and get the gingerbread, man)
Sacrifice mics and push drugs to these rappers
Puff ponies 'til I turn blue in the lips
Sippin broads like 7-Up (ahh) so refreshing
I think I'll pop these verse like first dates to birthdates

NYC gave you the ball, so how you gonna hate us?
We creators of them East coast stars
If you ask me I'll tell you there's no comp
But I'm still humble, even though I will crumble halls
Some call 'em songs, I call 'em words from me
that take long to cook
So some feel free in saying that we don't hunger for beats
Not that we not hungry, just picky in what we eat
Keep food off the mind and keep weight off the body
All you gotta do is keep my name out your mouth
And stop frowning like you hostile
You know that it's a booger rubbing up against your nostril
Nigga how you figure you can play this rap game without the backbone?
It's Maseo, Dave, Wonder Why, giving what you lack holmes

[Dave]
Hey yo prepare yourself for the Neutron, bitch!
This is eighty-six, let that neo-rap go
We present these flares to put fire to your ears
to lay smoke like rusty exhaust pipes
We run mics, let Sean run the marathon
Yo raise that money son, we raisin these kids
Get claps when curtains close, stage left
Up your stamina baby, bring some breath
SAT book smart, part ese
Loc'in like Tone, street niggas get grown
Acquire more couth before you get poofed
Or get some shells sent over to your mic booth
Excuse, my delivery, but when peace don't work
see this piece goin' work, cock aim and shoot!
It's my constitutional right to bear arms
Arms and bare hands on mics, make fans unite
Woodstock and white folks involved
Black man get on yo' job!

""Well clap your hands to what he's doing
On tempo Jack""

[Chorus: x2]
Let's go beat for beat, and rhymes for rhymes
(put, all, the things aside)
Just bring your beats, and bring your rhymes
(put, all, the things aside)

The heavyweight L.I. brother with no date, of expiration
On this fate on the mic, them birthday keep coming
I'm hated on by niggas I love most
So what threat could you possibly pose when I'm on your coast?
So raise your guns or your glasses
Either way there'll be a toast in the air
Markin the return of bare minimums you need to learn
Get your verbs right when you down to clap

[Dave]
See that gun powder caliber rap'll tip hats like gentlemen do
Smash tenements and skyscrapers
Bow-tie papers stacked high
Pay the resident tax or get your street sweeped
Front row, backstage or the cheap seats
I ""Dodge"" ricochets like ""Ram"" trucks, you slow poke to pull it
And I sup-pose you want to top the Billboard chart
Man I toast these rhymes and then pop like Pop-Tarts

Now time for me is nothing 'cause I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there
Now you shouldn't be scared

And I'm under each snare
Intangible
Bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view
Look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose
Sit and lose

Chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe

Lifeless

You have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child of peace
Every cloud and sea
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise (that's right)
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles but percussion he provides
For me as a guide
Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'ma stick around with Russ' and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

Can it be my De La clothes

Style is surely our own thing 
Not the false disguise of showbiz

So I don't get in aftermath 
But if I do I'll calmly punch them

Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should it's all on you

I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been through and paid my dues
Can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all on you-whoahhha-ohh-yeah

I wish that, you could be a little bit more upfront
Weigh the situation how you want right
The lovin' that you claim is just a four letter word
The third letter's invitin' so visualize the verb

You curve thoughtways when you're handlin' the candleabra
So you sittin' on the baby grand
Transmittin' like you're made of man
But you paint a funny face like a chick
When I see you I'ma tell you quick that

[Unverified]

I can't believe we built this large pizza pie together no pepperoni
Yeah, you wanted extra cheese, sometimes I gave you extras
How we divided slices like the Red Sea theory
I was Moses hopelessly scorned by your thorn zapora

Tried to bring that fairy-tale life, you wanted horror
But my microscope couldn't see or cope with that
I had to bolt from that, and left you dead in the sea
It's better for me, I'm satisfied with reppin' for D

We were certified hot, then dropped to lukewarm
Now we back up in the spot, claimin' never been gone
Niggaz who cut us off, wanna reattach us now
(Them girls who brushed us off, say they want some [unverified] to dial)

Yeah, I give that ass a number and some lumber to pile
Now catch a curve from my kick
(Or show me lovin' by brick)
So stick to the same plan, don't come shakin' my hand
Like we peeps, it ain't beef but be sure to understand
Between us, it ain't all

You see them kids be schemin' on what we done copped
Always out there schemin'
They steady fiendin' for the moment they can get us off the block
Why they always fiendin'?

Your people might have your back
But you need to watch your front
Indeed, ain't nothin' guaranteed
That's the truth, things ain't goin' like you think they should

A lot say they wanna walk in my size 10's
Aight then, here's a pair
Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me
You see ain't no young boys up in here, keep a clear head

Tryin' to keep my pockets on stuffed like deer heads
Upon the wall, so all the gall we get from y'all don't faze
So mind your biz and walk away
'Cause I'm never gonna let you up inside my maze

I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me

Hello it's the Soul
Troopin' in wit the Jungle patrol
And this one's about the KO's the knockouts out there
Who's holdin' my buddy
Hold up
(Wait a minute)

Now just wait
We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate
But before we let the herd out the gate
Make sure the all the levels are straight out the jungle
(The Jungle, the Jungle, the Brothers, the Brothers)

De La Soul, from the soul
Black medallions no gold
Hangin' out wit Pos hangin' out wit Mase
Buddy buddy buddy all in my face

For the lap Jimbrowski must wear a cap
Just in case the young girl likes to clap
Ain't for the wind but before I begin
I initiate the buddy with a slap

Now for the next
I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
And when I quest for the buddy I don't fess
For my jimmy wants nothin' but the best (the best)
The best (ooh wee!)
Let's stick out jimmy and see what we can catch
(Stick em up, stick em up jimmy)
Nets won't be needed unless
(Jenny wanna get right to the flesh)

(Sweet little woman, sweet little woman)

I won't lie, I love b-u-d-d-y (why)
Cause I never let it walk on by
When it comes to me and Jenny
I seem (very serious) like a Peek Freen
Buddy is the act that occurs on the lip
When Jenny and jimmy start shootin' the gift
Boy let me get shot I won't even riff

Buddy buddy, don't you know you make me go nutty
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy
Not too skinny and not too chubby
Soft like Silly Putty
Miss Crabtree I hope that you're not mad at me
Cause I told you that it was your buddy
That was making me ever so horny
Junglelistically horny

On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the

Q to her tip

On the A side and sometimes the flip
(Gotta gotta flip this record)
Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree
And the Luden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug 3
(Plug 3 gets all the buddy)

Behind my bush my buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin' out
(Oh let loose the juice)
My buddy helps me to
(De La my Soul)
Keepin' jimmy in total control
Without Jimmy I'd be on a roll

(La la la l-la la la la, la la la l-la la la la)

Hey girl I heard ya lookin' for some good times
If you Quest from the Soul here's what we'll find
A whole lot of fun lots of fun together
Just like kissin' cousins (yeah that's kinda clever)
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close
If you be my buddy I will toast
That we're like Ethel Merts and Lucille MacGillicuddy
You can be mines and I can be your buddy

The best buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin' less Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed

Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)

And I watched and then I checked my swatch
To see the time
The Soul had formed a buddy line
And that buddy was (mine all mine)

Now when Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul
Is at the clubs our ritual unfolds
Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands
(Then Jenny start flockin' it everywhere)
Cause Jenifa just wants to stay aware
Yo fellas should we keep her aware

'Cause I spilled the phenomenon
Pack the holes in my lawn
The girls in my sauna

Well, I'm a better brand 'cause I'm a Superman
I run the block with my circle 'cause I'm Nubian
I got the platinum rust, so don't even fuss
'Cause DJ Paul, he's down wit us

Now people stop takin' my stylin' for a joke
I don't sassafrass I put the foot up the ass
Sometimes I'm fast, blow off like a seal
When they reminisce over you
For real

And now Renee King is on my telephone
But I got the ring, ring, ha, ha, hey, hey
'Cause this type of shit it happens everyday
I got to make me a connection so my imports stuff

Bigger than bigs, dig it

Ways that amazes popes

No weights for the baits

For a verb unheard of

Alright you got it if you're special
With a dapper toe tapper when a lot's goin' on

All this and a condom 'cause I be a taxpayer
Promotin' of a moccasin, I skin like Danny Boone

When I swallow hear the

So give me room just give me room back the hell up
Back the hell up

Or when I run the mic there won't be no delayin'

Girl meets boy on Thursday night
Boy was high, girl fly like kite
They hold hands until next day
Boy then lets go, hit his way
Boy rules butt, brags to his boys
Erection brings bad boy joys
Boy thinks of that big fat back
Big black fat love, big black fat
Girl calls boy to stand him up on Saturday
Saturday

Saturday, it's a Saturday
It's a Saturday, it's a Saturday
Saturday, it's a Saturday
Saturday, it's a Saturday

Back once more with the wallop in the score
Must I ride and rip, should I make you rock your hip
Reviver of a roller-boogie in a rink
And sure to make you think about the times
To scope fun instead of fights
(But diving from a piece of metal sure to take your life)
Yo, slip your butt to the fix of this mix
Toss that briefcase, it's time to let loose
Cause you've worked like heck to get the week in check
So unfasten that noose around your neck
Connected like a vibe from the wheel to the foot
Come on everybody dig the funky output

Five days you work
One whole day to play
Come on everybody, wear your rollerskates today
It's Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday-ay
(Is the word, is the word, is the word)

Now as you pump your fist I reminisce
To a bounce, rock, skate, roll
Fess to impress
Hey, pretty diamond, do you like the way I'm dressed
Cool, keep the faith and be my mate
Cause all we need is feet
(And rollerskates)
But promote the hustle cause it keeps me thin
No need to talk, look who just walked in

(Is there a Dred on skates?)
Yes, man
(So kick the wham on this jam)
Oh Mr. Sprinkler, Mr. Sprinkler
Wet me for one, Mr. Sprinkler
I'm heatin' high-five in a daze, no split
With a yawn I trip to the dawn
Out comes the bodies following the one idea
It's clear, rattle to the roll
Hold back up the track, grab your rollerskates y'all
And let's zip on by
Zip-a-de-doo-dah, let's zip on by
Feed on a weed and we're feeling high
Sun is on thick and the cheese is rollin' quick
Come on, there's no time to hide
Season is twist, spinning and winning
No hackeysack, let let me in
Spill on the bottom away, but it's okay, huh
It's a Saturday

Now let's all get baked like Anita

Watch Mr. Lawnge, don't look at the peter

Feel on the fun, I'll feel on the

Hey, watch that!

It's a Saturday

Now is the time
To act the fool tonight
Forget about your worries and you will be all right

Have!
I wonder why I feel so good. Could it be the music?
Could it be my breakfast? Or could it just be the fact that
 
I just hate everybody, dammit!
Life is grand, life is great, I'll get myself a real cheap date.

Once again it's another rap bandit
Fiending at I and I can't stand it
Wanna be down with the Day-Glo
Knocking on my door, saying, ""a yo yo""
Knocking on my door, saying, ""a yo yo""
""I got a funky new tune with a fly banjo""
I can't understand what the problem is
I find it hard enough dealing with my own biz
How'd they get my name and number
Then I stop to think and wonder
Bout a plan, yo man, I gotta step out town
You wanna call me up? Take my number down
It's 222-2222

Enters the new
But nothing's new 'bout being hawked by a crew
Or should I say flock cause around every block
There's Harry, Dick, and Tom, with a demo in his palm
Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves
And flaunt a nut that's doggy as in dope
But it's not the mood to hear
The tales of limousines and pails
Of money they'll make like a pro
I be like, ""Yo black, just play me the tape""
But at the show the time to spare I just make
But the songs created in they shacks
Are so wick-wick-wack, situations like this
And now I hate they give me smiles cool-Aid wide and ask
""Was it def?""
And with the straightest face I be like, ""Hell yes""
I slip them the digits to Papa Prince Paul
So I don't go AWOL but yet I know when they call

Party at the dug-out on Diction Ave
Haven't been to the jam in quite a while
Figure I'll catch up on the latest styles
'Stead piles and piles of demo tapes bi-da miles
All I wanna do is cut on the decks wild
But edition up here bi-da miles to the center
Reliever of duty, Plug One mosies in
And I be like, ""Yo G, Pos does all the producing""

Now woe is me to the third degree
Mase pulls the funny so I make like a bunny
Jettin'
But I'm getting used to this demo abuse
Getting raped and giving birth to a tape
'Cause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker
Attached to my success, sent like a stalker
Make way to my radius playin' fly guy
Try to get on my back they force like Luke Sky
Me myself and I go through this act daily
And rarely do I not
No matter how I dodge some jackal always nails me
No matter what the plot
And even out on tour they be like,
""Yo I got a tape to play you back at the hotel""
I be like ""Oh swell""
Unveil the numeric code to dial my room
And tell them to call me at noon
But of course there's no answering machine in my room
But a pretty young adorer
Who I swung on tour
And if it rings while we're alone
She'll answer the phone
And with the quickness she'll recite like a poem

""Hey, you done did the right thing, dial up my ring ring
Now you're waiting on the beep
Say, I would love if you'd sing
The tune to Tru instead of fronting on the speak""
So no problemo, just play the demo
And at the end it's break out time
Please oh please don't press rewind
'Cause I'll just lay it down the line

Whoever thought selling heart would get you seventeen, that's seventeen
I mean yesterday was everything if there's no hope for tomorrow
And money ain't everything, I can go broke tomorrow
Sometimes I find happiness in a broke down cigar
In an isolated room on this Navajo wall
Mind drifting, smoke disappearing through the wall
I hear the loud voices, that's my homies calling
Open up the windows, let the angels fall in

As I bob and weave between stars
Learn and dream between Mars
When words are weaved, pictures are painted
Like Navajo Rugs or woven blankets
As I bob and weave between stars
Learn and dream between Mars
When words are weaved, pictures are painted
Like Navajo Rugs or woven blankets

Got so much on my mind, all these thoughts weaving in and out created design
So intricate like hand spun rugs
They say they talking outside
But I hear no love
I feel the shots in my back
But there's no slugs
I brush the dirt off my shoulders
Wipe away all the mug that's been slung
They say the sword ain't as mighty as the tongue
The horns get the attention
But the war starts with the drum
808s and low ends beating on my chest like King Kong
Gorilla warfare, the force here
You could feel it in the song
All the warrior in this gone
I sip Indian style wrapped' in blankets
Smokin' on the bong, trynna find my inner peace
Jugglin' stone, never take it for granted, what the struggle is for
Cuz through that dark hole life is beautiful, like emeralds and gold
There's diamonds in the dirt, you just gotta dig through some coal

As I bob and weave between stars
Learn and dream between Mars
When words are weaved, pictures are painted
Like Navajo Rugs or woven blankets
As I bob and weave between stars
Learn and dream between Mars
When words are weaved, pictures are painted
Like Navajo Rugs or woven blankets

I woke up among the confused, but yawning
The bloodstream came to collect dues this morning
For all the signs we drop, the parachute supplies
Are limited, coated in images
Yet the code of the streets leaves our thoughts with no access
The revenue of colour, all reduced to a blackness
But aside the thought, I can find the calm
That's why we close our eyes to concentrate
The cons debate, against the pros talking first degree
Murder on the clock, they got time to kill
I'm intricate to be up in it
So I defend every minute, cons hoping for dimes to deal
Perimeters occupied by a few chosen
To take heed to the fact a few in here are posin'
On the laws of lies, attracted to the warm like wool
But don't let it get pulled over your eyes
Oh, lord

As I bob and weave between stars
Learn and dream between Mars
When words are weaved, pictures are painted
Like Navajo Rugs or woven blankets
As I bob and weave between stars
Learn and dream between Mars
When words are weaved, pictures are painted

Have you actually had the audacity to think
You could strut past me with our lips trying to link
We know the lip service gets them
Tingling and nervous system
Every spot of ink on your legs and arms
Is all mine to charm and I plan to be in it
From every second of the minute

Miss Independent like record label contracts
To contacts of lips is lunar
Eclipse, the moon as soon as eyes clash
We strum at new tune makes myself fall knee deep in the stroke
Girl you know I can't sleep till I poke
Don't front, come creep with a bloke,
Let's go!

De La Soul,"Fresh from a bible belt town
That's what she's givin' up
Not really livin', just flesh comin' off a Greyhound
That's what he think of her
Right at a blink of an eye he provides her with charm
Hides that he is a shark
Suggests a few apartments, never hints to the home
That's what he wanna do
She just wanna new zip code for an old dream
Lost in an appetite now the big apple might
Find her habit of a queen
Feel the negro that's filled with an equal match road
Destination unknown
She's Little Bow Peep
And her and her whole sheep gonna have their wool unsewn
Now the wolf give a push
Now watch her jump in with two feet
Blue heat don't know how to swim through the limbs
Everyone huggin' her, tuggin' her
Ride on the merry-go-round of four drinks and two white lines
Go fast with the fast life so she needs more
One fun fix, now a daily chore
Provide the score, written and produced so perverse
He's a pro well versed
Told her that the purse that she want
With the shoes that she love and the rent that she need paid
She can earn with speed in a day
Escort on the high class side
Champagne glass rides
White snow waterfalls, oh how time flies
When you're flyin', crash and burn
She learned that her soul was dyin'
That's worth savin'
She's cravin' that bible belt town
So she crawls back on the Greyhound

Next stop, NYC
Take your seats please
I know exactly where you're goin', I can see it on your face
I know how to get there
And I give you my word that I get you there safe
I don't need to check your baggage
I don't need to know your name
All I need to know is
By the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed

Fresh new Gucci belt, bound
Fast to the city scape
Dash to deliver fate
Stashed in this duffel bag, proud
He's no scaredy cat
Life always spared in thy name
That the gamblers fold
No chips if the scramble got cold
But them warm cushions and them soft bus seats
Push that second thought along
Beneath the roof of a Super 8, he sleeps 'til it's night time
Then connects in the streets like a pipe line
In dark shades he supplies dark brigades
Of lost souls with his chemical morsels
He's no lab tech
He was born into a legacy stretched from Aztecs and beyond
Assets he was drawn to
Had him spinnin' the wool over his mother's eye
He's the black sheep
His pops career driven, he's the backseat
The man on the wheel that cruises on sunrise
That the man bought eyes to his pay per view
The kind of paper make a fool shoot a staple through
And take the label too
Until he's campaign
Unitl a pancake pocket change the landscape
Take a short visit home in the town
It's time to re-up, it's back on the Greyhound

Next stop, NYC
Take your seats please
I know exactly where you're goin', I can see it on your face
I know how to get there
And I give you my word that I get you there safe

By the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed
By the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed
Forever be changed, forever be changed
Just watch where you're goin'
And this food you're chosin'
I don't need to check your baggage
Pick it up along the way
All I need to know is
By the time you arrive you'll forever be changed, changed
Forever be changed, be changed

Put you behind the finest steering wheels 
Fearing you would drive a nigga crazy
Told you grow up, but shit you was my baby
Bits and pieces never made nothing decent
When I accommodated you, you played me like a stranger

Accountability is major
A part of what I did then

Let me see how many palms go up high
If you've ever felt the world had you licked (put 'em up high)
And what you waving side to side to symbolize
Needing help on the sand 'fore you under quick
Big mama said ""the Devil's up to no good""
But we can heal it on a Sunday with a good book (but)
Oft we deal it on a Monday for a good look (and)
Make it part of the campaign, to withstand pain
Me, myself, place it all on my shoulders
And give it my all, like heavy lifting
No gain without tears and sweat
They claim blue skies with white clouds, steady drifting
When pain come to get ya (it hit ya like flu)
Better times will pick ya (do what you gotta do)
To earn focus in the stormy weather
Come out the tunnel to the light saying

Slow pain, no gain, go getta
Change like the weather
Solid as a rock, small piece of leather
But well put together
Flames are endeavors
Time to find out that game makes it better
Pain makes it better
Shades of epiphany, can't let it get to me
Move so differently, do it so swiftly
Ease into my style, lay mine down
King be crowned, look at me now
Teaching my classes by the masses
Used to gang bang, used to love the clashes
Now cash is the only motivation, but not for me G
I’m into public relations
That's food for your De La Soul, word to the letter

Yo, the bigger the headache, bigger the pill
The harder you fall, stronger the will
We came from the back of the bus
Talking ""Watch the mobile,"" now we're on a house on a hill
The struggle went from filling ya gas tank
The bank wasn't feeling your loan
The OT couldn't cover the bills
And life came with a couple of spills
But we're gonna use that pain fo' fuel so

Give me no excuses

Pluck signs on the jackets
Get props, yo, like a Prop Joe packet
It's illegal
How those kids can come from out of the slums to live so regal
Lose it all on a prayer to the evil
Before the loss we earn for the cause
Toast to the life life though my liver won't endorse
Currently in time and my enzymes
Are in sync to digest the brink of armageddon
The veterans over the mattress, we lay with the actress
For social media to swallow us
Watch them rap peers who don't reply back
Cause they think we gon' snatch up their Twitter followers
That's some female type foolery
And your females like glue to it
She know it, the scent of a poet
Police buy restraint to cover all the angles

See one got all you in your crew confident with courage

And my cousin on parole cause he sold Glocks

Wearing a gold watch that obviously don't work
Used to go home and rob niggas for homework
See if the chrome work
Might call your girl to see if my phone work
I'm a hood star and the trophy is a gold vert
Mouth full of gold teeth
Niggas might end up obsolete if I'm four deep
Real nigga for ale bed full of new sheets
Bedroom floor filled up with the loose leaf
This is a war zone, me and a two-piece
Put another head on and make it a new piece
She be like ""ooh wee"", I be like ""ooh wee""
I love myself so much I'm a groupie
Everybody know my verses is pookie
Had 'em all strung out like it's a drug house
When I'm in the booth I'm MJ with his tongue out
When I'm in the booth I'm Kanye with a gun out
Running your mom house
Then I'mma leave sideways and burn out

Got a bunny hopping a quick ten seconds
Dear Lord, forgive a nigga, I've been down with out
Had the frog legs, now I'mma knock this piggie out
Now Dave like to cuddle, but Dave don't play that
Like Dave had the ring, listen, Dave ain't say that
Courtships, door steps, didn't ask if it's one of my broads
Keep your feet off the grass size eleven the gas
Mash that potato 'till we lay in the grass

If she the mermaid give her the fish stick
First class flight, shoot her out to the district
Wait, cancel the stallion, hold your horses
Kickstart your life and cut your losses
Look how we did 'em, ma, your boy still got it
I quit drinking, I quit the narcotics
Life's a bitch, but she seeing a therapist
This hip hop done dilly to cameras, huh
We got stoops and vander robes to sit on
Big coins Vivian Mears to bid on
But we cautious
Never undermine the hate and turn the spell on your evil forces

Så alt for ordinær blek og triviell

Mer spennende og sexy vet do vel

Det har do aldri
noen gang forklart
do blir nok lei ganske snart

Og ingen var så myk og varm og øm
Så det var himmelsk å hvile hos Cecilie
Hos henne ble mitt liv en deilig drøm

And he shoots you dead and he eats your head

Just have your party on TV

Where he won't have a hassle with the human race

Mambo slow Guantanamo

Was so glad escape in Trinidad
Upside down in Kingston town
Stole a car in the streets of Panama
Went too far in Bogota

Space cake break at the Titicaca lake
Got some more in Ecuador
Asked for a dance in a dive in Port-au-Prince

Looks like it's time for that certain holiday

If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me

So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

Is this just fantasy?

A little high, little low

Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead

But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph

Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier

And I won’t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me

Hm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Hm, we keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home""",Summer Sun,2016

With barbed wire of rage.

But my soul runs straight to hell.

Se en gnistra glimma starkt här inne,
Kom så springer vi längs vägen mot de blå,
För det finns ingenting nu som kan hindra oss två,

Innan klockan slår en sista gång,

Under en himmel som bär sommar färgen blå,
Innan klockan slår en sista gång,

She feels his hand and smells his warm breath
Looking up all she sees is the night sky

He saw her standing there alone
She saw him walking the whole town behind him
He loved to whisper gently to her
She heard the whole world shouting and screaming

Oh since first we met
My dark sweet silhouette
Oh nothing nothing you forget
In your heart my dark my dark sweet silhouette

He told her everything he wanted her to know
She showed him the big picture
He gave her beads and clothes and promises
She gave him golden strings and things that don't break down

Oh since first we met
My dark sweet silhouette
Oh nothing nothing you forget
In your heart my dark my dark sweet silhouette

Deacon Blue,"I wrote this once before
Long before the summer
You were then a student
And we were dark as angels
We were in the east
Working to the west
The west was looking south
And the south she had no pity
But last night I dreamed
And you were always
In it
There were
Hopes and plans and schemes
And the town was full of winners
Oh brother
Oh sister
This changing light
Has lighted things so
Differently
Has lighted things so
Differently
I wrote this once before
And we were all then working
We thought we`d stop the flow
Of a cruel and heartless woman
If I`d known this then
What would these wings have done
They`d have beat and flapped and flown
And not done and not done
But last night I dreamed
And you were always
In it
There were
Hopes and plans and schemes
And the town was full of winners

I kept it in the dark

I stuffed it in my pocket

Deacon Blue,"So maybe you're standing
In some foreign town
You've walked for miles
'Til the heat slows you down

And your jeans and your curls
Are bleached and split
And your money and your anger
Are all used up

Maybe I'm sorry
About the light in this place
Makes my heart seem cold
As the words on these pages

Maybe I'm reminded
By a shop window display or a decoration
Like some church candle that might just burn

'Cause we're dancing under chandeliers and I'm telling you
Caught in the headlights and I'm yelling it at you
Why is it girl when the world is lit by lightning
That I keep telling you that I love you

So you're ten miles out
Of this city at night
When do coloured lights
Become paint and glass and dust
And how I wonder
What light to trust
The light of the distance
Or the candle that might just burn

'Cause we're dancing under chandeliers and I'm telling you
Caught in the headlights and I'm yelling it at you
Why is it girl when the world is lit by lightning
That I keep telling you that I love you

Seraphim and cherubim
Skies full of gold dust
Moonshine and starlight
Pockets full of rainbows

Windows and mirrored balls
Porcelain and silverlake
Dance hall neons flash and swing
Blow out your candles

It will call you angel
Angel

When the world knows your name

Dancing under chandeliers and I'm telling you
Caught in the headlights and I'm yelling it at you

Talking diamonds talking steel
Don't talk things that, folk don't know
Talk about money and stuff that's real

All things get busted, some things get builded

Back here in beanoland all things are real

For the company from the south
Tells the stories of how things are there
Talks about their life talks about ours

And watch those trains pull in and out

Deacon Blue,"I think the whole world should look good
That's important to me
Everyone should look good
And when they die they should die with their boots on
And their hearts on fire

When I die they'll cry
I'll have candy and chocolate whirls
And party gowns framing bonny girls
Will carry me off to Disneyworld

I think the whole world should be funny
That's important to me
If you can't be funny don't be ugly
When they speak they should speak with their hands firmly on their hearts

When I die they'll cry
I'll have candy and chocolate whirls
And party gowns framing bonny girls
Will carry me off to Disneyworld

I like to see people happy
Singing on the way to work
Children and animals happy
When they laugh they should laugh like us
Not like other creatures do

Deacon Blue,"Tomorrows a holiday and we will be high all day
Singing and playing shows and going as far as the country bus goes
And the bands will be swinging as high as the swing boat goes
And the trees will be swaying and the boats will be heading out to the sea

Hey don't let the teardrops start for all of the times you've had
Go now and rest your weary heart
Tomorrow is near

'cause' all the friends are departing the night skies are parting
Late drinkers are singing their way home and the tower bell is ringing over the ????
Seems like the country is smiling the good times returning
Don't let your eyes start clouding and your old songs start bringing you down again

Hey don't let the teardrops start for all of the times you've had

",Don't Let the Teardrops Start,1990
Deacon Blue,"There was ice and broken pavements on the hill tower
And the light was falling from the infirmary
And the last of the dogs was barking
At the steps from gentle teardrops and me

And I asked about her sister and her mother
And her uncle Tom serving on the sea
And her grampa's gammy leg that kept him in his bed
And kept out gentle teardrops and me

And its a long way to keep up conversation
When your broken up over fish 'n' chips and peas
And the grease is on your arm
Like a girl you've never worn
Walking home gentle teardrops and me

It's a cold cold night..Its a cold cold night
And I won't forget September is your birthday
And the prisons been paid up for fifteen weeks
And I'll send it through to ease
You can take it as you please
With love the gentle teardrops from me
With love the gentle teardrops ........from...me

Deacon Blue,"I take off my glasses and I pull on my shirt
I call up my friends on my long ,long list
I said I've got a reason just to get to the coast
I'll stand on the streets where all the books were wrote

I remember words
That ran around my head
And made no sense at all
And rained right off my tongue
Like mother, love and Ronnie Spector

I'm in an old Humber
That takes a long, long road
And remembering the smell
Of summer on the parcel shelf
And opening up the quarter light
And holding out a scythe
That levels out the landscape
As a car, car travels

I remember words
That ran around my head
And made no sense at all
And rained right off my tongue
Like mother, love and Ronnie Spector

If these things don't get me
Then walking in the rain will.

Take me to the place where your heart hurts most
Lead me through the dark world gates down there
Where all the ghosts of sorrow and pain
And fear and despair stay hiding
And we'll walk right through to our own way, our own place

There's a beach that I walk so long and so broad
Oceans away miles longer than pain
In my glad dreams, I take you there, and it's easy
Because the work and the hours
And the pay are far behind our sure steps

My heart longs to be next to you
My heart want's to be there, be there with you
Where it's warm and tender and mercy flows like a river
And there you stand with your wide open hands
And say abide with me

Deacon Blue,"There's no sleep inside
Their dreams are broke and inspired
All the times you try to
Scream
Houses dark indoors
And blinds are pulled and closed
Everything that needed
Change
And there`s nothing wise
Or twice as good as nice
You save it all inside while you
Hang your head
Hang your head
Underneath it all
Your smile your smile your smile is flawed
And the songs you sing are only
Spoken
The promise of this child
You crossed your palms with silver crowns and the
People swore he's only
Choking
There's no promises
No light is ever shed
Between the living and dead

No light is ever shed

Deacon Blue,"Lily love that's a
Beautiful name
Your precious gifts are not the same
Since they faded away
The song so distant
But it still rings true your
Beautiful hands were rudely used
To make things pay
Every minute of every day
You don't get angry `bout what`s taken away
Is only real life
Every second of eternal light
Piercing through this sorrowful night
Will bring the sad heart
The cold heart
To love again
Last night I dreamed of
Henry Thomas in the
Delta light his rusty pipes
They drifted away
Standing in some
Dusty patch
It felt so close that I could almost catch
His breath on me
Every minute of every day
You don't get angry `bout what`s been taken away
Is only real life
Every second of eternal light
Piercing through this sorrowful night
Will make the sad heart
The cold heart
To love again
Every minute of every day
You don't get angry `bout what`s been taken away

Deacon Blue,"I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember",Goin' Back [Live],1994

And he packs his lunch in a ""sunblest"" bag

He never lets on
But I know 'cause he once told me
He let me know a secret about the money in his kitty

Instead of me
I hear your laughter and there's something I've got to know

Should I ring your door bell or just walk away

I see two silhouettes at the back of your window shield
Are you there with another girl
When I am gone
I can't believe you'd break the promises that you made
If your there with another girl I can't go on

I only know I love you I couldn't say why
So if there's another I don't want to know
If you should go I would surely die

I hear the music coming out of your radio
I only know I love you I couldn't say why
So if there's another I don't want to know
If you should go I would surely die

You would never leave me hurt me or deceive me
I'm a fool to doubt you worry so about you

Would curl upwards like the wild sea
A special friend knowing all the ways of love
Would talk his way back inside a tiny second

Don't promise good intention
One in a thousand (maybe even me)
Don't know there are clouds in the sky
Sooner or later everyone will say the same thing

Baby, you already know
That all I want is to be with you
Call me over sooner
Call me right now

I'm standing underneath the blackest rolling sky
I don't know my way forward
I'm dizzy with the wind
Turning like a compass never true only spinning

All I want is to be with you
In the sad and lonely pines
Where no midday sun ever shines
As the clouds all float into thin air

Underneath the blackest sky somewhere
I hear the soul of man never dies
I hear that special will survive
Keeping time over the rolling roads

Staying with me as my thoughts all go
Chasing away in the green fields
Where every breath gives up and yields
To all I want",All I Want,1999
Deacon Blue,"Love hurts, love scars, love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud holds a lot of rain
Love hurts, ooh, ooh, love hurts
I'm young I know but even so
I know a thing or two I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a stove burns you when it's hot
Love hurts, mmm, mmm, love hurts
Some fools dream of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
But they're not fooling me
I know it isn't true, know it isn't true

Deacon Blue,"Alan doesn't understand her
He only thinks in numbers
He only drinks in restaurants
Where the girls are fully covered

And he can't trust his yearnings
And he doesn't like pretending
His tempers stretched so much by work
His heart needs gentle rending

He calls her the chocolate girl
Cause he thinks she melts when he touches her
She knows she's the chocolate girl
Cause she's broken up and swallowed
And wrapped in bits of silver

Alan doesn't understand this
He says he's only human
So he still lights up with old flames
As if to try and prove it

And he doesn't like emotion
He's not certain of their ardor
If pouting causes so much fun
Then breaking hearts is harder

He calls her the chocolate girl
Cause he thinks she melts when he touches her
She knows she's the chocolate girl
Cause she's broken up and swallowed
And wrapped in bits of silver

Alan doesn't understand her
He thinks it's getting harder
So he spends the night with old friends
Underneath the covers

And he talks about the chocolate girl
And how he thinks she melts when he touches her
And that she knows she's the chocolate girl
Cause she's broken up and swallowed
And wrapped in bits of silver

I will love you when the moon is riding high
I will love you when we only have pretending
When our home becomes a cover from the sky
Well my eyes have seen the dust and then the ashes
And the lowland and white sky of your home
And the rain that washed mascara from my lashes
And nothing gave us cover from the sky
When you`re gone I notice all your tiny touches
And it`s then that I see it's then that I know why
If the days become the walls you never wanted
Our years will give us cover from the sky

Of love and pain
Under the gentle arches we rode
The silver streets
Couldn`t see a difference between gold or
Wooden cross
Could never see where we`re falling
Came in to love

Then hounded by love
Hounded by the very thing you dreamed up
Chased inside the walls you tried to breach
Sent crashing to your knees
Only tender love
Understood the need you need with
Understood the time it took
To take you where nothing ever was

Never was there once nothing
And everything once was
Not dead but still and ready to be born anew
Looking back now it all
Seems so clear
Like staring so long unseeing for someone to light inside a
Darkened room

Then try your tender love
Push you back till there`s nowhere left
Nowhere to feel nothing anymore
Nothing that will comfort you more
More than tender love
Understands the need you need with
Understand the time it takes to get home and have a love again

On wages day
On wages day
And the cap from Disneyland
That his cousin she brought back
Stays open in his hand
From one week to another
And this long narrow land
Is full of possibility
All to do and only hours
He said all this is all yours
You can have it all
You can take it all away

Deacon Blue,"All my worries
All my care
Is held in check
For you not there

Evening comes
And darkness falls
We sit round
And curtain out
The black night

There is a time
Away
From here

Seasons pass
So quickly come
And steal the days
Your work has done

They leave the fields
So bare and grey
I long to hold
You there and say
It won't change

There is a time
Away
From here
There is a time
Away
From here

Will we be lovers
Or will we still be
Will we be lovers
Or will we still be

Will we be lovers
Or will we still be
Still be still be

Deacon Blue,"Send me back all the thing she ever wrote
Tell me secrets of her days when she was young
Show me nights when she laughed
So innocent
I`ll be happy
Waiting till they come
Love the people that she smiled upon
Walk with me in streets
Where she once stood
Say if it could be that we once passed like strangers
Long before the love we ever new
`Cause I've been longing
For a new world waiting
I've been hoping
To be sent
I've been picking up
All the love we squandered
Until you
Hold me in your swaying arms again
One day I can see us walking
Arm and arm in sheltered Kelvin way
Talking and tripping and teasing
And heading for the best part of the day
When your head
Falls softly on my pillow
No fear will make you cry or turn you grey
And we will wake
So early in the morning
Knowing you`ll never
Never
Never go away
`Cause I've been longing
For a new world waiting
I've been hoping
To be sent
I've been picking up

Hold me in your swaying arms again

Rest me in your swaying arms again

From dreams that seem so bright
Flying hope like kites
Hold loved ones tight
And turning to the light of that long window to love

And you forget about the years
About the planting and the dying and the growing
And you forget about your cares
But you remember that they've been forgotten
By the people sent to London

They're taking down your cares
Drinking off your tears
Gambling on your fears
For things that cost so dear
And won't be paid for years
Hoping you won't stare down that long window to love

They'd burgle all your sanity if it would let them hold you under
They'd knock on your door so hard the frame would crack under the strain

Endowed with the fear of flight.

And embrace the light.

Beneath starless nights.

And now it's time for you to renounce the old ways
And see a new dawn rise.

When the god came down from off the mountain,
And a sacrifice was made
For they knew the day of WRATH
Was fast approaching.

Just like yesterday...
Before the war.

Up ahead there lies your road
And your conscience walks beside you

And the past is now your future
It bears witness to your soul
Make sure that the love you offer up
Does not fall on barren soil

For the wind cries of late
In the whispering grass
Our way of life is held
In the spinning wheels of chance

I believe in a way of long ago
And the sounds I believe rose our glow
And we're changing our ways

Yes, we are taking on different roads
Tell me more about the forest
That you once called home

For the wind cries of late
In the whispering leaves
And the sun will turn to waste
The heavens we build above

Father, teach your children
To treat our mother well
If we give her back her diamonds
She will offer up her pearl

We must sing her creation song

Invoke the spirits that feed us

Can you tell me?

To own that car would be a luxury
But right now I can't afford the gas
A brand new convertible is out of my class
But that can't stop me from-ah thinkin' to myself 
That car's fine lookin' man
It's somethin' else

Hey look-ah here
Just wait and see
Workin' hard and savin' my dough
I'll buy that car that I've be wanting so 
Get me that girl and we'll go ridin' around
The town will be all shocked with my white top down
I'll keep right on and dreamin' and-ah thinkin' to myself 
When it all comes true, man
Wow! That's somethin' else

Look-ah here
What's all this?
Never thought I'd do this before
But here I am ah-knockin' on her door 
My car's out front and it's all mine 
Just a '41 Ford not a '59
I got that girl and I'm-ah thinkin' to myself 
She's sure fine lookin' man
Wow! She's somethin' else",Something Else,2001
Dead Celebrity Status,"(Chorus) - Move out the way when I'm passin' through.
I got heads to the front and the back of you.
I got the world in my hands, you could have it too.
I got two middle fingers and they're pointed at you!

(Chorus)

I'm the messiah, I'm anti-celebrity,
I'm anti-war like John Lennon in the 70's.
Dead Celeb's the movement, your the student,
It's time to change the world kids!
Here's the blue-print.
Something smells like teen spirit,
Like the ghost of Kurt Cobain wrote these lyrics,
And forced America to listen,
With a million angry misfits screamin', ""Fuck the system!""
I'm the pain in Axel Rose's diary,
That's why an appetite for destruction lives inside of me.
I'm not - your - typical lyricist,
Acting gangsta and sellin' out appearences.
They need to take a musicology class,
So thank God the prince has finally come back,
To save from the whack water at El Creek's sideshow,
I'm the anti-American teen idol!

(Chorus x 2)

Like the hands of Michael Jackson's plastic surgeon,
Changin' music into a different person.
I took it's face and changed it, replaced it,
Surgically, verbally, gave it a face lift.
Now it's some new shit we callin' Blood Music
For Dead Celeb fans who can relate to it.
(And now!)
So let the games begin, you either turn with the world or you watch it spin.
If your dreams were stolen by a liar,
Then steal it back like your name is Winona Ryder.
Don't be afraid, be stronger, divide and conquer,
Come out swingin' like Ozzfest concerts.
Times up, I'm callin' you to rise up,
No more walking blind with your eyes shut.
Find a message hidden in these chapters
Like Black Sabbath records played backwards!

(Chorus x2)

[10 second interlude]

I'll fight for this like it's a violent game,
I'm in between Grand Theft Auto and Max Payne. I'm the magic in the hands of David Blain,
Spit so much that I'll leave this microphone stained.
Along came a spider, spinnin' webs of hatred.
Welcome to the wonderful world of entertainment,
Where stars are born and celebrities tell lies,
The revolution will now be televized!

[11 second interlude]

(Chorus x 2)

Move! I got two middle fingers and they're pointed at you.

Move! I got two middle fingers and they're pointed at you.

Move! I got two middle fingers and they're pointed at you.

Move! I got two middle fingers and they're pointed at,

Fuck you!",Messiah,2005

[Bobby] See I would be there through thick and thin,
in sickness and in health, from beginning to end.
You gotta decide, me or him, Erica, tell me I'm curious.
[Yas] Bobby, I didn't mean to cut you off but are you really being serious?
You sound delirious, I can't believe I'm hearing this,
Erica's my girl, she always has been, period.
She hates you, what makes you think she would date you?
You got a new girl, like every week, at least I'm faithful.
[Bobby] Erica, take my advice, like how long have you known me?
I know Yas, he's the kind that'd leave you stranded and lonely.
Why are you lying to me?
So don't come crying to me.

[Yas] Bobby's obsessive, he sleeps next to your pictures.
Now, let me go get Justin to cry you one more river.
- Cry me a river.
### big on pleasing but he acts like he mastered it.
I heard two minutes and he's sexually inadequate.
[Bobby] Okay, Yas, he's a loser, and I don't see the attraction,
all those pickup lines he uses, he read 'em in the last Maxim.
And ask him about how he likes to flirt with strangers.
He'd drop you in a second to watch the Indiana Pacers.
[Yas] Bobby, come on, you and Erica are dead wrong,
you'd have better luck hooking up with Stifler's Mom.
[Bobby] Listen, Erica's my soulmate, my fate, my world,
so get that through your head and go chase some other girl.
[Yas] Now Erica's my dream, my Billie Jean, my life.
Now is it him or is it me? You shouldn't have to think twice.

I was happy at the time,
never knowing who was mine.
Now I hear your heart is broken.

[Yas] Yo, you need to - pay me a listen, and -uh- follow my vision,
and -uh- stop playing mind games and make a decision.
[Bobby] Listen up, Erica, this whole charade feels senseless.
Never knew a girl could come between friendships.

I never meant for this to grow so far,
I'm waiting to find out who you are.

The harder they come, the harder they fall.
The quicker they come, the quicker they crawl.
Dead Celeb's coming back with this brand new track.
Here's another taste from our swinging battle axe.

You wanna be a star, here's a gimmick and a style,
To mimmick and free clothes to help design your image.
I feel like the only way I'll see fame and wealth,
Is to kill myself the same week my record hits the shelf.
All you really need is a record label budget,
Then watch the machine force feed it to the public.
Hate it or love it, watch it or unplug it.
Careers disappear quicker than next week's club hit.
You're just a puppet on a string I'm your master.
You're not cut out to sing, you might as well be an actor.
Or write a chapter how sex sells music,
Nobody likes your songs, they watch your videos muted.
Mixed and diluted, polluted trashed will crash.
This prostitute music selling songs with ass,
I gasp for breath, Dead Celeb pass the test.
Music for a living? I can't ask for less.

Fuck mass appeal and fuck keeping it real,
I feel I need to date Tommy Matola for a record deal.
What would you do for that big contract?
Change your face like Michael, be on American Idol?
Act homicidal and eat your own intestines.
I thought we were musicians not Fear Factor contestants.
Overnight stars want credit? Forget it.
Yeah, you went platinum, but who bought your record?
Extra philosophy, behind a music prodigy.
The next best thing since The Motley Crue Biography.
It's like Gods become a shark in deep water.
You swim up to the mainstream, then you bite the author.
You could be a star, too, if you're near edges.
Fuck the opinions of these haters and critics.
They can be so cynic, quick to call you a gimmick.
You can't tarnish my image, you can't write it, I live it.

And we wouldn't want that

So say uncle
And we'll take you to the mental health zoo

In hi-tech science research labs
It costs too much to bury all the dead
The mutilated disease-injected
Surplus rats who can't be used anymore

In a spiraling corkscrew dispose-all unit
Ground into sludge and flushed away

We joke about it on our coffee breaks

Dead Kennedys,"Finally got to Washington in the middle of the night
I couldn't wait
I headed straight for the Capitol Mall
My heart began to pound
Yahoo! It really exists
The American International Pictures logo

I looked up at that Capitol Building
Couldn't help but wonder why
I felt like saying ""Hello, old friend""

Walked up the hill to touch it
Then I unzipped my pants
And pissed on it when nobody was looking

Like a great eternal Klansman
With his two flashing red eyes
Turn around he's always watching
The Washington monument pricks the sky
With flags like pubic hair ringed 'round the bottom

The symbols of our heritage
Lit up proudly in the night
Somehow fits to see the homeless people
Passed out on the lawn

So this is where it happens
The power games and bribes
All lobbying for a piece of ass

Of the stars and stripes of corruption
Makes me feel so ashamed
To be an American
When we're too stuck up to learn from our mistakes
Trying to start another Vietnam
Whilke fiddling while Rome burns at home
The Boss says, ""You're laid off. Blame the Japanese""
""America's back,"" alright
At the game it plays the worst
Strip mining the world like a slave plantation

No wonder others hate us
And the Hitlers we handpick
To bleed their people dry
For our evil empire

The drug we're fed
To make us like it
Is God and country with a band

People we know who should know better
Howl, ""America riles. Let's go to war!""
Business scams are what's worth dying for

Are the Soviets our worst enemy?
We're destroying ourselves instead
Who cares about our civil rights
As long as I get paid?

The blind Me-Generation
Doesn't care if life's a lie

So easily used, so proud to enforce

The stars and stripes of corruption
Let's bring it all down!
Tell me who's the real patriots
The Archie Bunker slobs waving flags?
Or the people with the guts to work
For some real change
Rednecks and bombs don't make us strong
We loot the world, yet we can't even feed ourselves
Our real test of strength is caring
Not the toys of war we sell the world
Just carry on, thankful to be farmed like worms
Old glory for a blanket
As you suck on your thumbs

Real freedom scares you
'Cause it means responsibility

So you chicken out and threaten me

Saying, ""Love it or leave it""
I'll get beat up if I criticize it
You say you'll fight to the death
To save your worthless flag

If you want a banana republic that bad
Why don't you go move to one
But what can just one of us do?
Against all that money and power
Trying to crush us into roaches?

We don't destroy society in a day
Until we change ourselves first
From the inside out

We can start by not lying so much
And treating other people like dirt
It's easy not to base our lives
On how much we can scam

And you know
It feels good to lift that monkey off our backs

I'm thankful I live in a place
Where I can say the things I do
Without being taken out and shot
So I'm on guard against the goons
Trying to take my rights away
We've got to rise above the need for cops and laws

Let kids learn communication
Instead of schools pushing competition
How about more art and theater instead of sports?

People will always do drugs
Let's legalize them
Crime drops when the mob can't price them
Budget's in the red?
Let's tax religion

No one will do it for us
We'll just have to fix ourselves
Honesty ain't all that hard
Just put Rambo back inside your pants
Causing trouble for the system is much more fun

Thank you for the toilet paper
But your flag is meaningless to me
Look around, we're all people
Who needs countries anyway?

Our land, I love it too
I think I love it more than you
I care enough to fight

The stars and stripes of corruption
Let's bring it all down!
If we don't try
If we just lie
If we can't find
A way to do it better than this
Who will?",Stars and Stripes of Corruption,1985
Dead Kennedys,"Cold concrete apartments
Rise up from wet black asphalt
Below them a few carcasses
Of the long gone age of privacy

It takes a scary kind of illness
To design a place like this for pay
Downtown's an endless generic mall
Of video games and fast food chains

One by one
The little houses are bricked up and condemned
A subtle hint to move

Who want everyone to sound the same
Who drive bright people out

Are the thieves and the goddamn liars
Flipping people off when they share their stuff
When someone falls are there any friends?

Others stay home, it's no fun to go out
When the gigs are wrecked by gangs and thugs
When the thugs form bands, look who gets record deals
From New York metal labels looking to scam
Who sign the most racist queerbashing bands they can find
To make a buck revving kids up for war
Walk tall, act small
Only as tough as gang approval
Unity is bullshit
When it's under someone's fat boot
Where's the common cause
Too many factions
Safely sulk in their shells
Agree with us on everything
Or we won't help with anythng

Just makes a split grow wider
Guess who's laughing while the world explodes
When we're all crybabies
Who fight best among ouselves

""It's competition, man, we want to break big.""

It just don't move me, ya know?
The music's OK when there's more ideas than solos
Do we rally need the attitude too?
Shedding thin skin too quickly
As a fan it disappoints me
Same old stupid sexist lyrics
Or is Satan all you can think of?
Crossover is just another word
For lack of ideas
Maybe what we need
Are more trolls under the bridge
Will the metalheads finally learn something-
Or will the punks throw away their education?
No one's ever the best
Once they believe their own press
""Maturing"" don't mean rehashing
Mistakes of the past

[Chorus]
The more things change
The more they stay the same
We can't grow
When we won't criticize ourselves
The '60s weren't all failure
It's the '70s that stunk
As the clock ticks we dig the same hole
Music scenes ain't real life
They won't get rid of the bomb
Won't eliminate rape
Or bring down the banks
Any kind of real change
Takes more time and work
Than changing channels on a TV set

Hurled off the cliff, we are gathered here today to take photos of the

From beirut gift wrapped in body bags, a truck bomb blew them to bits
We knew they were sitting ducks we sacrificed 'em, aztec style so we
Could use their dead meat to cook up war fever back home so make
Sure you take lots of pictures and slant your news our way just like in

I want to tell you a story about the last time I was in Portland. 
The night before we played at the Long Goodbye. 
I was walking on the street about 10:30 at night. 
A lot of people go to bed around here at 10:30 at night. 
And well, I was walking along when suddenly these jocks in this 
bright blue pickup drove up. It had KC lights, tractor tires, 
everything but the CB. It was a life-size Hot Wheels car for some dumb rich kid, 
right. Well, they drove up to me 
and they yelled what dumb rich kids usually yell, ""Hey, faggot,"" 
and showered me with some water. 
So, I stood there thinking, what a bunch of fuckheads and picked up a rock. 
Now, I waited, walked down about a block to 
where the Kentucky Fried Chicken is, on Burnside, 
and sure enough they drove around again. 
They said, ""Hey, faggot, where's the nearest McDonald's?"" I said, 
""I don't know"" and they squirted me again. 
So I threw the rock and put a nice-size dent in their giant Hot Wheels car. 
They screeched to a halt in the parking lot of some department store, 
who's name I don't remember, it's up the street from Fred Meyer, 
and they got out their clubs and they ran after me, yelling, 
""We're gonna kill you, you god damn faggot, we're gonna kill you, 
you motherfucker."" 
So I got in a phone booth by the Kentucky Fried Chicken on Burnside, 
held my legs straight out like this so they couldn't open the door 
to the phone booth. So they began charging the phone booth, 
beating on it with their club, yelling, 
""We're gonna kill you, you motherfucker, we're gonna kill you, 
you god damn faggot."" I just looked at them. 
So, there was a crowd gathering by this time 
and these kids were standing nearby and they said, 
""Oh, look at him, he's insane."" I thought, ah-hah, here's my way out. 
I yelled at them, ""Take me to a mental hospital right away. 
I want to be be put away. 
Please put me away, c'mon, call the cops and put me away. 
Please put me away now."" 
They said, ""Alright, faggot, we're calling the police."" So they called the police. 
The cop comes out and I go, ah, my savior, I'm away from these jocks. 
He opens up the door, ""Get out of there, you,"" 
throws me up against the car, frisks me, shoves me in the back. 
Then he goes over to the jocks, ""Now what happened here? 
It looks like we're going have to take him to jail 
but we got to have the full story first"" 
So the jocks, who had an ace in the hole, ace in the hole 
Take down on the bass, a little bit down on the bass. Yeah, 
ace in the hole, and they go, ""Well, goddammit, 
the motherfucker put a dent in my truck, a $5000 truck, right, 
so I got my club, I went out and I wanted to kill him. 
I want to kill him. Let me kill him, goddammit. 
Let me kill him."" 
So the cop made them go home, and he drove me home, 
and he confiscated their club and my rock as further evidence. 
And I thought, so this is Oregon, huh? Tolerant Oregon?

Parents hate me, I got zits
And bruises 'round my head 

Pressure's on to get good grades
So I can be like them
Do my homework all the time
I can't go out just then 

People they ain't friends at all
They tease and suck me dry
Yell at me when I fuck up
And party while I cry
I look so big on paper
I feel so fucking small
Want to die and you don't care
Just stride on down the hall 

Suicide suicide
Read the paper, wonder why
Turn the light out, then you cry
It's your fault, you made me die 

Touch me won't you touch me now
So frozen I can't love
When I was born my mama cried
And picked me up with gloves 

Girls, they kick me in the eye
Want answers to the tests
When they get them they drive off
And leave me home to rest 

Hold my head
Make me warm
Tell me I am loved
Give me hope
Let me cry
Make me feel
Give me touch 

The window's broken bleeding screaming
Lying in the hall
I'm gone no one remembers me
A picture on the wall
""He was such a bright boy
The future in his hands:""
Or a spineless human pinball
Shot around by your demands 

Suicide suicide
Goin' to sleep and when I die
You'll look up and realize
Then look down and wipe your eyes
Then go back to your stupid lives

Dead Kennedys,"Greetings:This is the Secretary of War at the State Department 
Of the United States
We have a problem. 
The companies want something done about this sluggish 

World economic situation
Profits have been running a little thin lately 
And we need to stimulate some growth
Now we know 

There's an alarmingly high number of young people roaming 
Around in your country with nothing to do but stir up trouble 
For the police and damage private property. 
It doesn't look like they'll ever get a job

It's about time we did something constructive with these people
We've got thousands of 'em here too. They're crawling all over
The companies think it's time we all sit down, have a serious get-together-
And start another war

The President? 
He loves the idea! All those missiles streaming overhead to and fro
Napalm
People running down the road, skin on fire

The Soviets seem up for it:
The Kremlin's been itching for the real thing for years. 
Hell, Afghanistan's no fun
So whadya say?

We don't even have to win this war. 
We just want to cut down on some of this excess population
Now look. Just start up a draft; draft as many of those people as you can. 
We'll call up every last youngster we can get our hands on, 

Hand 'em some speed, give 'em an hour or two to learn how to use 
An automatic rifle and send 'em on their way
Libya? El Salvador? How 'bout Northern Ireland? 
Or a ""moderately repressive regime"" in South America?

We'll just cook up a good Soviet threat story 
In the Middle East-we need that oil
We had Libya all ready to go and Colonel Khadafy's hit squad 
Didn't even show up. I tell ya

That man is unreliable. 
The Kremlin had their fingers on the button just like we did for that one
Now just think for a minute-We can make this war so big-so BIG
The more people we kill in this war, the more the economy will prosper

We can get rid of practically everybody on your dole queue if we plan this right. 
Take every loafer on welfare right off our computer rolls
Now don't worry about demonstrations-just pump up your drug supply.
So many people have hooked themselves on heroin 

And amphetamines since we took over, it's just like Vietnam. 
We had everybody so busy with LSD they never got too strong. 
Kept the war functioning just fine

It's easy. 
We've got our college kids so interested in beer 
They don't even care if we start manufacturing germ bombs again. 
Put a nuclear stockpile in their back yard, 

They wouldn't even know what it looked like
So how 'bout it? Look-War is money. 
The arms manufacturers tell me unless 
We get our bomb factories up to full production 

The whole economy is going to collapse
The Soviets are in the same boat. 
We all agree the time has come for the big one, so whadya say?!?
That's excellent. We knew you'd agree

The companies will be very pleased.",Kinky Sex Makes the World Go 'Round,1987
Dead Kennedys,"Efficiency and progress is ours once more 
Now that we have the Neutron bomb 
It's nice and quick and clean and gets things done 
Away with excess enemy 
But no less value to property 
No sense in war but perfect sense at home

The sun beams down on a brand new day 
No more welfare tax to pay 
Unsightly slums gone up in flashing light 
Jobless millions whisked away 
At last we have more room to play 
All systems go to kill the poor tonight 

Gonna kill kill kill kill kill the poor

Feeling out of place
I'm out of reach
Waiting for the time to come
And every second always on the run
Looking for love once more
Then turning back and closing every door
Thinking that what might have been
Had that itch not gotten 'neath your skin

Praying to an idol sign
Believing this can keep your dream alive
Worried 'bout the waste of youth
Hoping that with age there will come truth
Dying to get out in time
Before the shadows start to cloud your mind
",Out of Reach,2001
Dead Moon,"I've been dragged through the mud
Told I ain't enough
Done a lot of hard livin' in a world that's sometimes cold
I been pitched and taken in

Somehow I disconnected along that road
But try as I may
I can never be the same
This time I'm here to stay

Been waiting in a line for the call that never comes

With a paralyzing gaze

And i swear, we won't keep standing still
Here to take your heat
The rain's about to fall
We're taking to the streets

Day after day nothing ever changed
Was it any wonder we all began to stray
Some of us for money, some of us for fame
Our goals were so impossible no one could take aim

Fought for every losing cause and now we hide the scars",Day After Day,2003

You think I don't belong

I was in the crowded season
When the leaves began to fall
I was in the mainline then
You were up against the wall
I couldn't see the end was near
You told me what I wanted to hear
It was easy to pretend
Remember me

And as I walked away
The changes that I saw
At once I was sure you'd made it
Just to see me crawl
And I remember you

Sooner or later I swear
I'll be taken on that long hard ride
Down to those sunset towers
Where you can hear lost angels cry
Falling like fire and rain
Back to my seeds again

Remember me

It can wreck your spirit, ruin your live
But you pay the price to reach that high
Cause you know you can't let go
For every bad moment when you've had enough
You tell yourself just one more touch
Cause you know you can't let go

As you stand on the stage and bare your soul
Your nerves are shot and the crowd's turned cold
But you know you can't let go
For in that moment, the blink of an eye
It can make you smile or make you cry
Cause you know you can't let go

What you know is who you are, who are you?
Do you know who you are in the world? what is your world view?
What do you go through? , what has your life showed you?
What are you learnin in this so called life?
Do you have principle or do you blow with the wind
Do you wanna be free but don't know where to begin
Do you know your enemy from your friend, even you can
It's deep in this scannin the system that keepin us here
Will we survive, do you believe, are we afraid
Would you rather have control of your life, or be a slave
Show me a sign, a pig ain't no homey of mine
They own me what's mine, I show you if you loan me your nine
I'm only concerned for tables to turn
When the people learn the truth about the system, the cities will burn
And I stand firm, like chaka zulu, these crackers can't stop you
Who you?

World war, they want me to kill four
What happened to the future they always predicted
With new science fictional things and space visits
I've seen two sides, us against them
Police troops ride with four to five men
Prison business is boomin, senators grin
People searchin for answers, where to begin
Capitilism born from the backs of blacks
White folks relax, live off the kick backs
Gettin work to the bone jo, build this country
Further exploided by class to make money
Filthy rich capilist with blood loot
Use main frames systems to bank and compute
With the next technology, credit to the wires
Internet growth the man more suppliers
Welfare, ederly checks and wage workers
All us, elephants trapped in they circus
Ain't fightin over man made chips no more
When the lights go out, it's gonna belong to the poor

Dead Prez,"Help me
You want me to help you?
Man is evil, capable of nothing but destruction

Once upon a time
There was a very serious situation growing
There was a farmer and a farmyard filled with animals
And this is the story of their times

Old man Sammy had a farm
Walked the land with the rifle
Most of the time shit was calm
His whole life was maintained off the everyday labor

From the mules in the field to the cattle in the stable
This is how we kept food on this table
(Maxing)
You would have he was disabled by the way he be relaxing
Acting like Mr. Magnificent

But the animals were thinking something different
The sentiment was tension in the barnyard
Throughout the years they had been through mad drama
With the farmer, word is bond

And they all came to one conclusion
They argued there was no way they'd ever be free
If it was up to humans
Therefore the only course left was revolution
Which was understandable

And since the pigs promised to lead in the interest of all the animals
They planned a full attack under the leadership of Hannibal
The fattest pig in the pack
The next morning on the farm, everything was calm

Just before dawn but before long
The sun got so hot it made the farm seem electric
Now check it this is when that shit got hectic
Directed by Hannibal, the animals attacked

Old Sam was in a state of shock and fell up on his back
And dropped his rifle reaching in vain
Each and every creature from the field at his throat
Screaming, ""Kill, feel the pain""

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

After they ran the farmer off the farm
The pigs went around and called a meeting in the barn
Hannibal spoke for several hours
But when talks about his plans for power

That's when the conversation turned sour
He issued an official ordinance to set
If not a pig from this day forth then you insubordinate
That's when the horses went buck wild

One of them shouted out
""You fraudulent pigs, we know your fucking style""
Hannibal's face was flushed and pale
All the animals eyes full of disgust and betrayal

He felt the same way Sam felt
They took his tongue out of his mouth
And cut his body up for sale, for real
You better listen while you can

It's a very thin line between animal and man
When Hannibal crossed the line they all took a stand
What would have done? Shook his hand?
This is the animal in man

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

I'm black like Steve Biko
Raised in the ghetto by the people

Ayo my life is like Roots it's a true story
It's too gory for them televised fables on cable
I'ma a runaway slave watching the north star
Shackles on my forearm , runnin with the gun on my palm

He was sayin if you black then you African
So they had to kill him, and make him a villain

Take a walk verbally, make a bond certaintly

And it's like we floatin out in space when you flirtin wit me

Dead Prez,"You have the emergence in human society 
Of this thing that's called the State
What is the State?  The State is this organized bureaucracy
It is the police department.  It is the Army, the Navy
It is the prison system, the courts, and what have you
This is the State it is a repressive organization
But the state and gee, well, you know, 
You've got to have the police, cause.. 
If there were no police, look at what you'd be doing to yourselves!
You'd be killing each other if there were no police!  
But the reality is
The police become necessary in human society 
Only at that junction in human society 
Where it is split between those who have and those who ain't got

I throw a Molotov cocktail at the precinct, you know how we think
Organize the hood under I Ching banners
Red, Black and Green instead of gang bandanas
F.B.I. spyin' on us through the radio antennas
And them hidden cameras in the streetlight watchin' society
With no respect for the people's right to privacy
I'll take a slug for the cause like Huey P.
While all you fake niggaz try to copy Master P
I want to be free to live, able to have what I need to live
Bring the power back to the street, where the people live
We sick of workin' for crumbs and fillin' up the prisons
Dyin' over money and relyin' on religion for help
We do for self like ants in a colony
Organize the wealth into a socialist economy
A way of life based off the common need
And all my comrades is ready, we just spreadin' the seed

The average Black male
Live a third of his life in a jail cell
Cause the world is controlled by the white male
And the people don't never get justice
And the women don't never get respected
And the problems don't never get solved
And the jobs don't never pay enough
So the rent always be late; can you relate?
We livin in a police state

No more bondage, no more political monsters
No more secret space launchers
Government departments started it in the projects
Material objects, thousands up in the closets
Could've been invested in a future for my comrades
Battle contacts, primitive weapons out in combat
Many never come back
Pretty niggaz be runnin' with gats
Rather get shot in they back than fire back
We tired of that - corporations hirin' blacks
Denyin' the facts, exploitin' us all over the map
That's why I write the shit I write in my raps
It's documented, I meant it
Every day of the week, I live in it; breathin' it
It's more than just fuckin believin' it
I'm holdin' them ones, rollin' up my sleeves an' shit
It's cee-lo for push-ups now, many headed for one conclusion
Niggaz ain't ready for revolution

If you examine what they tellin us then you will understand
What they plantin in the seeds of the next generation
Feeding our children miseducation

Or what they do when they up in the stars
Because i don't believe a word of what the president said
He filling our head with lies got us hypnotised

It's a plot, but busta can you tell me who's greedier?
Big corporations, the pigs or the media?
Sign of the times, terrorism on the rise
Commercial airplanes, falling out the sky like flies
Make me wonder what secrets went down with Bob Brown (?)
Who burnt churches to the ground with no evidence found?
It's not coincidence, it's been too many studied incidents
It coulda been the Klan who put that bomb at the Olympics
But it probably was the FBI, deep at the call

Yeah, yeah
Imagine havin no runnin water to drink
Chemicals contaminate the pipes leadin to your sink
Just think, if the grocery stores close they doors
And they saturate the streets with tanks and start martial law
Would you be ready for civil war
Could you take the life of somebody you know, 
or have feelings for if necessary?
I got cousins in the military
But far as I'm concerned they died, when they registered

[Verse 2]
Yo, this world is oh so cold, I think about my ancestors
Being sold, and it make me want to break the mold
Fuck the gold and the party, train yourself, clean your shottie
Tell me what you gon do to get free, we need more than MC's
We need Hueys, and revolutionaries
The niggas on the streets today, it's kinda scary
The smell around my way ain't roses or strawberries
In fact it's kinda poisonous, bringin out the boy in us

I don't want to drive no fancy car
I just want to be free, to live my life, to live my own life

Yeah, I'm for peace
But I'll kill ya if ya fuck with my moms or my niece
See we all want peace, but the problem is
Crackers want a bigger piece
Got it where the niggas can't get a piece
That's why police get stabbed and shot
'cause a nigga can't eat if the ave is hot
Locked up you get three hot meals and one cot
Then you sit and rot, never even got a fair shot
That's where a whole lotta niggas end up
My man moms even got sent up, tryin to keep the rent up
When I'm bent up I think a lot about the reason I'm here
I think about the things I fear in the comin years
Ahead of me, I'm ready for whatever they bring though
I'd go against a tank wit a shank for my dreams
And that's my fuckin word
One day the whole world will smoke herb
And niggas won't get took to jail for hangin on the curb

That, uh, in places like in the arctic,
Where indiginous people sometimes might, might, hunt a wolf,
They'll take a double edged blade,

And they'll put blood on the blade,
And they'll melt the ice and stick the handle in the ice,
So that only the blade is protruding,
And that a wolf will smell the blood and wants to eat,

And it will come and lick the blade trying to eat,
And what happens is when the wolf licks the blade,
Of course, he cuts his tongue, and he bleeds,
And he thinks he's really having a good thing,

And he drinks and he licks and he licks,
And of course he is drinking his own blood and he kills himself,
That's what the Imperialists did with us with crack cocaine,
You have these young brothers out there who think they are getting something

They gonna make a living with,
They is getting something they can buy a car,
Like the white people have cars, why can't I have a car?
They getting something they can get a piece of gold,

White people have gold, why can't I have gold?
They getting something to get a house,
White people have a house, why can't I have a house?
And they actually think that there's something that's bringing resources to them,

But they're killing themsleves just like the wolf was licking the blade,
And they're slowly dying without knowing it.
That's what's happening to the community, you with me on that?
That's exactly, precisely what happens to the community,

And instead of blaming the hunter who put the damn handle and blade in the ice
For the wolf,
That what happens is the wolf gets the blame, gets the blame for trying to live,
That's what happens in our community,

You don't blame the person, the victim,
You blame the oppressor, Imperialism, white power is the enemy,
Was the enemy when it first came to Africa,
And snatched up the first African brothers here against our will,

Isss the enemy today,
And that's the thing that we have to understand.",Wolves,2000

Up in the book of life.
That man shall;
Endure forever more.

well did you know the pen,
Is stronger than the knife.
And they can kill ya once,
But they can't kill ya twice.
Did you know distruction of the flesh is not the ending to life,
Fear not of the anti-christ.
Did you know that I,
Exist before the earth.
And did you know my eyes,
Are windows to the world.
Did you know you can't go ah Zion and ah wear jerry curls,
Can't tell di boys from di girls.
Your body's just a vehicle,
Transporting your soul.
It's what's inside the people,
Is beauty to behold.
Fear not of evil.
Everyday the flesh,
It grow old.
Changes of the times,
Take a toll.

So shall it be.
Me want to big up marcus garvey and me big up hughy p.
And me wanna know washality.
And I meant, reality.

I see it in the signs,
Everyday I live.
It's clear to my mind,
Somethin' got to give.
The system is the problem,
But it ain't just gonna change.
The people got to fight as one,
To break free from the chains.
We livin in a time,
Where whitey got us cornered.
Shackles on the brain,
Police on every corner.
Lookin for some soldiers,
But they so hard to find.
My elders say be patient,
'cause things come in time.

not fast enough because yo,
They wanna rewrite me history.
I made him a lot of mystery.
'cause we too strong for them dis we.
Because it was,
And now it is,
And it will definitely be.
We know,
The days is up.
Blaze it up.
African warrior,
Raise it up.
Push it up.
Fill up your cup.
We had enough.
We gonna buck.
Now is the time.
Open your mind.
Then you will find.
It's a design.
No matter what you do,
No one can stop the time.

and me want no
Kkk, no cia, no

Heart broke, tired, started freakin'
Year later terminated for no reason

Got a new girl as the leaves turn brown
Seein' me stressed said she would hold me down
Had to move to the Bronx where the crooks be juxin?
Sold my first track, moved back to Brooklyn

Music 101, the whole game is dirty
Got me 25, feelin' all of 30
Went from a lover to straight up hustler
Stressed a lot, developed clusters

2 G, Y2K bug is gone
Put my gas mask back 'coz them lights is on
Dead Prez in the stores and the streets is groovin'
Hi, I'm still broke and my beats is movin'

Gotta grind harder 'coz my bills is major
Got a cell phone, had to dead the pager
Can't blame the game 'coz the game don't feed you
Can't blame the world 'coz the world don't need you

Seem like every excuse I use is see-through
Help myself first, then help my people
'Coz folks sells hope, runnin' scams to burn me
Wash me, comb me, relax and perm me

Gotta get control and stop this car from swerving
Now I'm kinda cold, only the doe concerns me
Try to spend less than the amount I'm earnin'
Lessons everyday I'm learnin'

She struggglin' she don't know I be hustlin' pulling my own weight
I be hearing them fuss and fightin' at night mad late
Over economics; it's logic meaning they don't got it
Living in the projects, money's the only object
She makes $280 a week, standing on her feet
The ends ain't even meeting the family ain't eatin'
'Cause if taxes is 10%, and the rest if for the rent

So much shit goes on it makes me doubt about a God -- you know, makes me ask
well if there is a God then why am I in the situation that I'm in?
Or why is my family going through certain situations
when I don't think that they deserve it nah mean?
Or why do good people suffer so much and bad people prosper so much?

I been working all my life but ain't got nothin' to show
I ain't tellin' you nothing you don't already know
I been working all my life but ain't got nothin' to show
want to run up in tha white house and kick in tha do' ohhhhh

What a nigga gonna eat when the refrigerator empty?
Work all week let the bossman pimp me?
Can't pay no rent till the 15th
Landlord call the police to evict me
Lookin for a job in the want ads
Have you ever been to jail? Know they gone ask
Ever took a piss test that you didn't pass?
In between jobs in the past? How you get cash?
I done worked over hot ass stoves
I done picked up trash off roads
Winter time in the streets and the cold
Many times had to sleep in my clothes on the flo'
What you know bout bein' po' seein' most of yo kinfolk be on dope?
Ain't nobody in the hood got no hope in this fucked up system and that's why we don't vote
Still payin niggaz 4.25 - How the fuck we supposed to survive?
I'm close to the edge, government takin most of my bread
in taxes might as well have this close to my head

You can work to the bone but don't put all yo eggs in one basket
We don't never get a piece of the pie
Work 50 years, retire then die
Stay po', rich folks is the criminal
but you don't want to hear me tho' so
thank God it's friday, ain't it what we live fo'?
Nigga gotta get up out the plantation
Same job that my pop had before me
Imma pass it down to my seed fucked up situation

(Verse 1)
What you know about the running, the stretching
The cars, the weapons
The path, the journey
The jewels, the learning
The fear, the focus
The aches, the pains
The contact sparrin', the breaks, the sprains
The trial and error, the ranks, and belts
The spiritual growth, the science of breath
The tests, the techniques
The forms, the stances
The flow, the rhythm, the internal answers
The herbs, the healing, the quiet meditation
The truths reveal through daily dedication
The love for the art, the sweat on your shirt
The mind, the body, and the spirit that work
The feelings of failure, the hope to succeed
The battles of questions like ""Should I smoke weed?""

(Verse 2)
The water, the thirst
The cleansing, the blessings
The flash of insights, the teachings, the lessons
The grappling and locking, trapping and boxing
The training and slacking
The starting and stopping
And stayin' committed, when your homies ain't with it
The hours or practice after the class is finished
The cause of your ignorance, flaws in your discipline
Broken laws of nutrition, and pork and dishin'
The vitamins and supplements
Salads and ointments

The kingships, pull joints in doctor appointments
The dues, the pads, the wraps, the gloves
The mouthpiece you left home, the taste of your own blood
The hunger, the blocks
The punches, the squats
The crunches, the example you set for the youngsters
The will, the skills, the kill or the hill
The separation between what's fake and what's real
The laws of physics, The class ""comradery""
The vows of humility, the bow, the courtesy.

But now I'm the new Nat Turner

Niggas follow the radio
Niggas think if you blow
Then you gotta be on the TV show

Crackas is hypocritical
Crackas will rob and shit on you
'Cause see you do what they do
They know freedom is powerful

Niggas is very visual
If we see it, we think it's true
Very few niggas make a move
And even less'll see it through

Crackas make up the chemicals
Then they call us the criminals
Crackas make all the loot
And we just get the residuals

Niggas will rob and shoot on you
Crackas will drop a bomb on you
Niggas is having funerals
Crackas is having barbecues

Niggas sing the blues
That's reminicin' the spiritual
But when you say gawd is you
Niggas ain't really hearing you

Crackas like to capitalize
Them crackas a lie
They say if you don't unionize
Then you'll probably die

I love callin 'em crackas

'Cause Kweli be showin' on the floor
And they policies, my philosophies
Show you that the block is a part of me

Freedom fighter like Richard Carter be
It's deep how the street knowledge beef
'Cause it ran like a code inside of me
It's practical, not scholarly

Now why do I call myself a nigga, you ask me
Who's got my back when the cops harass me
New York, L.A or Cincinnati
Can ride the train or with the Caddie

When they call you, nigga they scared of you
They fearin' you so actually
If crack is gone, be fearing niggas
Then that's what the fuck I have to be now

It's a badge of honor
And some say that shit's absurd
It's more than just a word
We flip the shit like it's a bird

Pass it down through generations
Then cuss you out and say it loud
The first generation of muthafuckas
To grab our nuts and say it proud

Country niggas or city niggas
Tupac niggas or biggie niggas
In the corridor, floor or door
And all my Mississippi niggas

We connected all throughout
The north, the east, the west, the south
And if a white boy say the shit
He'll still get punched right in the mouth

On the boulevard, in the avenue
It's a long walk, now that we ridin'

They want you dead or in jail without rebel, my nigga
In the streets, it's similar to hell, my nigga

So prison or death is just somethin' I done accepted 
So we'll murder a snake, and we'll kill a skunk ""that's right""

So right now is the time and you turf the location

Dead Prez,"We could grow
We could develop
As we know, the heaven is not a place
And happiness lives in the heart
Long as the world keep turning
I do years, we keep on learning
Ya heard?

Keep on learning
And soaking up game
We gon' make mistakes
We gon' go through some things
Keep on growing
Keep on soaking up game
If something ain’t working, don’t be afraid to change

Nobody know it all, as soon as you think you do, that’s when you fall
We gotta do more than survive, we must evolve
Things change just when you thought you seen it all
We trip, we stumble but we get back and strike
Each day, all the way, one step at a time
Don’t wanna make my ego and pride make me blind
The elders say “when you stop growing, that’s when you die”
The one who gets the knowledge is the one who asked “why?”
Through the course of life, you gon taste some humble pie
But I love it, it makes me appreciate the things that I take for granted
Gaining insight and understanding
Each one, teach one, we got to pass it on
Keep doing the knowledge, building and had in all
We’re fake that need assumption
That nobody knows everything but everybody knows something

Keep on learning
And soaking up game
We gon' make mistakes
We gon' go through some things
Keep on growing
Keep on soaking up game
If something ain’t working, don’t be afraid to change

Yo yo, the more you know, the more you know, you don’t know
And if you don’t know there’s more you can know then you won’t grow
What you don’t know can hurt you, discipline is a virtue
You gotta ask the right questions, it helps you go into cycles and ciphers and spirals
Information is viral, it infects you, it’s contagious and have you going through stages
Like deny, you don’t believe that
No, we didn’t do that
Then reality set in, there’s no disputin’ the facts
Yo I’m sorry if I woke you up, but we’re not open up
It’s like I’m smoking but I’m half the people, watch me soak it up
Huey said the best education is observation and participation
Study hard, the people be relatin’
Different points of views turn bad news to good news 
See, it’s kinda like some shoes 'cause they gotta make you move
Treat it like organic food, make it something you can chew
Information you can use, make it something you can do

Keep on learning
And soaking up game
We gon' make mistakes
We gon' go through some things
Keep on growing
Keep on soaking up game
If something ain’t working, don’t be afraid to change

Aye man, it’s okay to say you don’t know
That’s when you let go your ego
You’re free from all illusion, dig?
Can’t make moves in confusion
Don’t look for conflict, man
Always look for the solution
And my pop said “humility is a sign of wisdom”
But to really soak it in, now that’s a different kind of listening
See man sharpen man
And every day is another lesson
And it’s not fair you only learn man
It’s a blessing
And as the Buddha says, “nothing lasts forever”
You gotta manage your expectations
The less we pray, the less we suffer
And this way we awaken
Right understanding
Right thought 
Right speech
Right action
Right livelihood
Right effort
Right mindfulness
Right focus

Tapped in to my own route
Wake up in the morning, throw my sneakers on
Hit the streets and go all out
Beat the concrete, magic carpet
Through the neighbourhood, through the project
Getting them hours and pass the college
No withdrawals without deposits
Feel that wind on my face, I'm Tommy Smith in '68
Fixed up, touch the sky, feels great, natural high
Sweat dripping down the block, healthy life, I’m out the box
When I run I'm in bliss baby, feel so good I don't wanna stop

Be what I wanna be, to know what’s right and what’s real
Invincible, unshakable, earth quaking but unbreakable
Unstoppable, don't stop until there’s no rock a few, now I got the joke
I come from the jungle, I drink from the fountain
I looked and I found this, as innocent Roberts
who died and backed out to the big bang
15’s of guap, we doing big things
Until the fat lady sang

Everywhere we go
Every day on TV
They be talking about
Who you gonna vote for
You got a black man running
But I wonder if he get in
Who he gonna open up the door for?
I don't wanna to discourage my folk
I believe in hope
I just want us to want more
Politics is a game
How they keep us contained
There gotta be more that we could hope for
Democrats and Republicans
Just 2 sides of the same coin
Either way, it's still white power
It's the same system
Just changed form
You wanna vote? please do!
Cast your ballot, let your voice be heard
But what I do want to say is
After the election
You'll see
Mark my words

[Chorus]
It's politic time again
It's politrick time again
It's politic time again
It's politrick time again

Shoot the messenger!

This is the most important election of all time
The government's committing the biggest of all crimes
These bullshit politicians say they speaking for the people
Before they ran for office, they were shitting on the people
Billion dollar campaigns
Trillion dollar bailout
Anybody know the definition of a sell-out? huh?
And if Obama win, he wouldn't be the first black
Take your 2 dollar bill and turn it over to the back (you see? right there)
But with the TV on, you only hearing they voice
The system is broken, they trying to beat a dead horse
Go ahead and vote for the lesser of two evils
I plot, plan, and strategize with the poor people
The middle class will say this opinion is irresponsible
But if you ain't got no healthcare, they kickin' you out the hospital
McKinney, Clemente, off in the Green Party
No disrespect, we need a Red, Black, and Green Party
Like Marcus Garvey's

As I know they would
I turn my back and go it alone, alone
When it seems it can't get worse

That allows the will of flesh to dominate and control
This is my counter attack
Starve the self, and empower the soul
This path I chose, once again made whole
Torn between self and soul
With first step forward

This is the last time I'll suffer through your exploitation
Harvest truth and save it for your revelation

And all your heroes will fail you

Give up hope, give up all fucking hope

You've given up and I know you've fucking died inside

All my heroes have failed me
And all your heroes will fucking fail you, fail me, fail you

Give up hope, give up all fucking hope

I'm sick of trying and I'll never put my trust in you

It's over now, there's no more damage that you can do

Lost in the cloak of night
Burned, broken, tired, hopeless

A cycle of despair
A never ending threat
A constant pushing force
My match is finally met
Let this thing take its course
New blood flows in our veins
Power moves quickly now

With one last option left
To destroy and recreate

",Death & Rebirth,2006
Dead to Fall,"They met in the dark of the night
For a final time, for the great showdown
Two dreamers deciding which path to take
One for their future, one for the present

I was standing strong until you showed your face
To ruin and ravage everything we've planned
Your dream is empty with its promise, your self fulfillment
The future holds so much more for us

One of us will die before this is over
One of us will die before this is over

The sword of vengeance glistens in the moonlight
Her words fall silent as he makes his attack
Now we will find out who truly holds the power
I'm waiting for you to relinquish your hold
There is no room for us so you must be destroyed
Then I'm afraid this is unavoidable

His blade plunges deep cutting down to the core
And with her last gasp for breath
All her dreams and aspirations fade
She pleads for him to see, to see, for him to see the truth

And with one final slice she's gone forever
No more dreams, no more tears, she's gone
And with one final slice she's gone forever
No more dreams, no more tears, she's gone

Bleed for nothing now, for no one hears your cries
Bleed for nothing now, for no one hears your cries
Bleed for nothing now, for no one hears your cries

He stands there victorious and alone
Suffering through what he himself has made
Without her, there is no point to my fight
He sees it all as it slowly begins to fade

One of us will die before this is over
One of us will die before this is over

He realizes now without her
Life loses point
Without the battle, without their struggle
Life loses point

He has no purpose now
Life loses point
As everything fades, everything fades
Life loses point

The struggle was keeping us both alive
The struggle was keeping us both alive
The struggle was keeping us both alive

Dead to Fall,"One step in front of the other
The clock wasting minutes away
Slowly counting the hour
That determines my destiny

In this place I wait
Looking at the stares
Not a kind of face among them
And no one cares

They all think I deserve this
And I probably do
The blade smiles at me
For it knows the truth

Take my place on the throne of
Martyrs and sinners
Martyrs and sinners
Take my place on the throne of
Martyrs and sinners
Martyrs and sinners

It's falling, falling and slicing through
Removing me from myself
For the final time I see now
That I deserve much, much worse

I am the serpent's head
And I must be severed
I am the serpent's head
And I must be severed

Nothing for me
But their cold hard gaze
My heart welcomes
Death's warm embrace

Take my place on the throne of
Martyrs and sinners
Martyrs and sinners
Take my place on the throne of
Martyrs and sinners
Martyrs and sinners

Give me no last words
Give me no last meal
Just give me sweet, sweet death
Make my worst fears real

I've done all I can
This is out of my hands
Don't ask me to forgive
And I won't ask to live

No more steps
And no more time
The blade, it falls
And ends this life

As the faces fade
And life, it flashes by
Fills with lies and hate
My demise has arrived

Falling downward in time
These walls speak of my hell
His vengeful eyes say to me
""My son, you have served me well""

I am the serpent's head
And I must be severed
I am the serpent's head
And I must be severed

Marguerite, even though you're gone, I can feel you in my heart
Marguerite, though you're free from harm
I still miss you, Marguerite

I call you up, excuses you could make
For why I can't attend a second of your wake
Without a tear, I cast a spade of dirt
I must admit that it still hurts

Molly, I'm just out of bath, my hair is wringing wet
The things that you remember, I'd just assume forget
All the lies you told me while we were in the throes
Are better left unspoken

And though you said you loved me with a trace of sincerity
“I'm sorry, please forgive me” is what I heard usually
My guiltiest confession even when I hate you most
I want you anyway...Oh, Molly...

Molly I just was a slave to your helplessness and charms
At times I would deliver you into another man's arms
And simmer in my jealousy, my impatience

I'm not your lover anymore, and I don't want to know the score

You tried to push through every crack, there are other ways

If you want it, you can reason all you want
But sometimes you just have to take the oath...(Take the oath)

You live from day to day to year, without leases
Each thing you say you have to clear little speeches

That isn't even part of your equation
You feel the slightest duration, do anything to avoid

If you want it, you can reason all you want
But sometimes you just have to take the oath...(Take the oath)

Now you hang from the slightest of threads
You walk in a house of empty rooms and frozen beds
Take the oath and regret it if you will
You have the time to kill, so take it, take it, take it

One song can only do so much, on a good day
Don't try to use it as a crutch, there are other ways

I see assured salvation, it's easy if you try

If you want it, you can reason all you want
But sometimes you just have to take the oath...(Take the oath)
If you want it, you can reason all you want
But sometimes you just have to take it!!!...(Take the oath)

Blood always cries for blood...the blood of the innocent screams for yours... heaven now cries with tears that are flowing forth like a stream and
The blood of your victims shall drip from the skies like rain and may the sun fall into oceans of blood... death and darkness shall reign for ten thousands
Of generations...your children will be drenched in blood... Because he who kills cannot love and he who loves would never kill....
There is no forgiveness and no mercy when mankind forgets its duties to creation and when my last words are spoken your families shall be cursed....
Now take my life, take my blood...to fulfil your hearts of hatred... you wanted the blood from the innocent and soon the innocent will splatter the ground
With yours... and your children shall pay for the sins of their fathers...ten thousand generations in blood.... ... ... he died and his words like thounderous blows
Rang and rolled over the earth... like a breath, like a wind, like a shadow, a phantom... and on the darkened sky crows will appear to bring back the light

I don't know how to let the story unfold
I'm a man of the cloth, and my conscience is bad;
I've got a gift for the cards and making men mad,
And running for life

The hot desert sun, can make a man mean
And the dignity lost, seldom is seen
At the El Paso Cross, I was sent there to preach
My innocence lost, and fell out of my reach
And out of my site

Well the ""holiest"" things are so hard to teach
Like the ""holiest"" men are so hard to reach,
Well I gave the kiss that betrayed the King
And that was my face at Gethesemene
Oh God forgive me.

. . . to the river

So what can you say - you know I still need your love.
What does it mean that you can't give enough?
Well you take it back a level and there we go
Back to flesh and blood - back to what we know

Blue, blue, blue river

Deadman,"You were protected, but you weren't connected
I was looking for you, but you don't come by
I see you're crying, your tears have run dry
Well maybe one day we'll correct that
For one another

Down by The Winedale, I took you home
Hey we were fine till something went wrong

I see blindness in your eyes
And I can see what's trailing you down tonight
So pour me a whiskey, cause I need a drink
Well the later I stay, the drunker I get on faith

Down by The Winedale, I took you home.
Hey we were fine till something went wrong

I'm up in the morning around 6:45
To unlock the doors for the drunks that come alive
I head to the jukebox to play The Tower of Song
The music starts playing but not very long

Down by The Winedale I took you home
Hey we were fine till something went wrong.

Well now that it's over - sure wish you could stay
Sure wish we could do like we'd planned from the very beginning

Deadman,"A weary man with haunted eyes,
showed up at my door last night
He said he was a friend of mine,
his face had changed since he'd done his time.
I let him in for a little while,
After a drink he began to smile,
and laughed and said 'The world's his prison cell
Somewhere between Heaven and Hell
Somewhere between Heaven and Hell.

Waiting for the day to come

The wind howled and began to moan,
the lamp flickered and the house groaned.
The pressure changed, my hands grew cold
as I remembered the story the locals told
About a man who will visit you,
with haunted eyes to collect his due
He was a tax-collector like Matthew,
and if he comes he comes for you.
And if he comes he comes for you.

This is a holy place

I slowly tried to excuse myself
went for the keys on the back bookshelf
And when I went to turn around,
he was standing there holding my keys in his hand.
He said ""You think you can get away? 
Don't you know this is judgement day?""
And I said ""I won't except that fate"" and I had no time to hesitate
I had no time to hesitate

This is a holy place

And if he comes, he comes for you,
And if he comes, he comes for you
And if he comes, he comes for you
",Ghost Story,2002
Deadman,"Lonely times, are haunting me
Just like a ghost in my house
You wait for dawn, like an angel to come
And pull you out of this place

Lonely people feeling blue
Lonely people just like you

There are times, to say
""We have grace - and so much to give.""
And we say prayers to Jesus
Because Jesus has felt our pain

Lonely people just like Him
When will they ever fit in?
I can't hear for the traffic noise
the lonely people playing with their toys

Lonely people feeling blue
Lonely people just like you.

Deadman,"William was a gun-fighter he was looking for his chance
Waiting for his time to come when he could make his name
Riding into town with a look upon his brow like he's gonna take from you
Or gonna take you out.

Phoenix was an Indian who had a knack for robbing banks
In the mesas of New Mexico is where they made their plans
To rob the Denver bank and to leave no one alive
And with their plans they rode northeast, their fingers on their guns
Looking for an angel or the pale rider to come
Looking for an angel or the pale rider to come

There back in Santa Fe, where you will find my love
A Spanish maid named Isabelle, with skin like holy dove
And if this plan goes bad, and I should meet my end
You send her Texas and make sure to treat her well

Connor was a law man - he protected the Denver Bank
He vowed to catch the riders, he vowed to see them hanged.
He told his men ""Be ready and when you see the rider's come,
Put a bullet between their eyes"" and the pale rider he comes
A bullet between the eyes and the pale rider he comes.

On the Denver horizon, that's where it all went down
Getting into to focus as the riders dust settled down
Connor had the street staked out and ready for the draw
And the tension mounted in the heat of it all
Connor said ""Don't worry, I'm scared to death myself
When I look into his eyes I see a demon straight from hell!
Coming straight for me - coming for the kill""
That's when the shots were fired
BANG
And it was done

All were looking for an angel when the pale rider, he comes
Looking for an angel an the pale rider he comes . . .

Oh holy, holy day
Oh carry me, carry me away
When we first went down

Rosa Marie tonight
Blessed Marie tonight

You're not looking for love,
Just an escape she said
But the boot is on the other foot this time
And we, we can be friends
We can make amends
If your prayers to Mary are heard

Rosa Marie, tonight
Blessed Marie, tonight

I'm not looking for an escape or a holy grail
I'm not looking for an easy way out
I'm just looking for the ""Cross of Santa Fe""

Deadman,"We take no prisoners, when it rains it pours
Give me time, give me sweet by and by
And I know we can make it through it.
When they say that it's not true when I say that I love you,
It's alright - I'll be standing by your side
When they say that it's not so, he won't be with you when
You grow old, it's alright - I'm hear to prove 'em wrong.

Chorus
So give 'em time and they'll come around
You gotta stay alive when the sun goes down
To see the glory of a city open wide
Cause tonight darling, you will be my bride.

Well the people up in Detroit - they get their soul from Marvin Gaye
And the people down in California, get their sunshine in L.A.
From the bluegrass to the blues, Elvis Presley's ""Blue Suede Shows""
Singing sweet Mississippi ghost crooning slide guitar
Down in Texas, it's alright with it's hot tequila nights
Selling romance of riding into Mexico.

Chorus

Well the preachers down in Greenwood, they stomp the Gospel out on hardwood floors
And the gamblers lost in Vegas, don't believe it anymore
Well they're trying just to behave hearing Robert Johnson from the grave
Running scared with the hell-hounds still on his trail
And Jacob in the field - to the angel's strength he yields
You feel the spirit moving and its hard to fail.

Chorus
",Sun Go Down,2002
Deadman,"
Three murders . . .
Three murders' what the headlines say
They contradict the blackened day
And there's nothing that can stop it they say.
Three victims
Three victims laid to rest
The cops all protest, the claim to have done their best

That there's nothing more they can do, nothing more they can do

Juarez,
Juarez is a haunted place
The ambulances try and race
To beat the other's to the place where
Three women
all working for the mighty peso, can't seem to let it go
and the numbers still climb and grow

And there's nothing more they can do, nothing more they can do

How long is to long and you've had enough?
How little is too late to stop it and the hate goes on and on.

And I hope you see the light of day
I hope you see the light of day. . .

Deadman,"I see violence coming around the bend
Violence is coming around the bend
I see violence burning bright - cuts through the murky night
And the water is washing over me

I walk through the shadow of death
I walk through the shadow of death
When a burning light cut's through the dreary night
And the water is washing over me

The soldier pierced Jesus in his side
The soldier pierced Jesus in his side
pierced Him with his sword - out holy water poured
And the water is washing over me.

And so I followed the mob
When their was earth to plow or guns to bear
I was always their right on the job

With peace and glory ahead
Why should I be standing in line
Just waiting for bread?

Made it race against time
