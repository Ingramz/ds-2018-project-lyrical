The Animals,"You must leave now
Take what you need, you think will last
But whatever it is you think you need
You better grab it fast

Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun

Look out the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

The highway is for gamblers, you better use your sense
Take what ever you've gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets

The sky too now is falling upon you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
Your empty handed armies, is all going home
The lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor

The carpet too is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Leave your stepping stones behind
If someone calls for you
Forget the dead you've left behind
They will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore

Strike another match, let's go start anew
'Cause it's all over now, Baby Blue
It's all over now, Baby Blue
It's all over, Baby Blue
It's all over, baby
Baby Blue
Baby, Baby Blue
It's all over Baby, Baby Blue","It's All Over Now, Baby Blue",1977
The Animals,"Many rivers to cross 
But I can`t seem to find 
My way over 
Wandering I am lost 
As I travel along 
The white cliffs of Dover 
Many rivers to cross 
And it`s only my will 
That keeps me alive 
I`ve been licked 
Washed up for years 
And I merely survive 
Because of my pride 
And this loneliness won`t leave me alone 
It`s such a drag to be on your own 
My man he left me but he wouldn't say why 
Well I guess, I have to try 
Many rivers to cross 
But just where to begin 
I`m playing for time 
There`ll be times I find myself 
Thinking of committing 
Some dreadful crime. 
And this loneliness won`t leave me alone 
It`s such a drag to be on your own

They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy

My mother was a tailor

My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Is a suitcase and trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Oh mother tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery

The Animals,"Now listen here to the story of Bo Diddley
The rock 'n roll scene in general
Bo Diddley was born Ellis McDaniels
In a place called McCoom

In Mississippi about nineteen-twenty-sex
He moved to Chicago about ninetten-thirty-eight
Where his name was eventually changed to Bo Diddley
He practised the guitar every day and sometimes into the night

'Til his papa's hair began to turn white
His pa said ""Son, listen here, I know""
""You can stay but, uh, that guitar's just got to go""
So he pulled his hat down over his eyes

And headed on out for them western skies
I think Bob Dylan said that
He hit New York City
He began to play the Apollo in Harlem

Good scene there
Everybody raved
One day, one night
Came a Cadillac, four headlights

Came a man with a big long fat cigar
He said come here son, I'm going to make you a star
Bo Diddley said uh, what's in it for me?
The man said uh, shut your mouth son and play the guitar

And you just wait and see
Well, Bo made it, he made it real big
And so did the rest of the Rock 'n Roll scene along with him
And a white guy called Johnny Otis took Bo Diddley's rhythm

And changed into hand jive
And it went like this

In a little old country town one day
A little old country man begin to play
Had two guitars and a beat-up saxophone
When the drummer said those cats begin to

Oh baby, ooh we oh oh
Ooh la la that rock 'n roll
You hear me, ooh we oh oh
Ooh la la that rock 'n roll

Then the U.S. music scene, there was big changes made
Due to circumstances beyond our control
Such as payola
The rock 'n roll scene died after two years of solid rock

You got discs like, uh
Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
And so forth

About, uh, one year later
In a place called Liverpool in England
Uh, four young guys with mop haircuts
Begin to sing stuff like, uh

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been workin' like a dog
And so on

A place called Richmond in Surrey
Way down in the deep south
Where the guys had long hair down their backs sang
I want to be your lover baby
I want to be your man, yeah
And all that jazz

Well we been doin' this number Bo Diddley
For quite some time now
Bo Diddley visited this country last year
And we were playin' the Club A-Go-Go in Newcastle, our home town

And the doors opened one night
And to our surprise in walked the man himself, Bo Diddley
Along with him was, uh, Jerome Green, his maraca man
And the Dutchess, his gorgeous sister

Now we're doin', uh, we're doin' this number
Along with them came Rolling Stones and The Mersey Beats
They're all standin' around diggin' it
And I overheard Bo Diddley talkin'

He turned around to Jerome Green, he said
Hey Jerome, what do you think of these guys doin' our, our material?
Jerome said uh, where's the bar, man
Please show me to the bar
He turned around to the Dutchess and he said

Hey Dutch, what do you think of these young guys doin' our material?
She said ah, I don't know, I only came across here to see the
Changin' of the guards and all that jazz
But Bo Diddley looked up at me and he said, uh

With half-closed eyes and a smile
He said man"", took off his glasses
He said man
That sure is the biggest load of rubbish ever heard in my life

Contrasting against the sky.
Tumble down black shacks over the tracks, 
Children so hungry they could cry.
The chrome the steel, the metal dream, 
Leaving the teeth which will rot.

Saving dimes for community pot.

But they fail to see the neighbors eyes.
The TV is on the six o'clock news,
And the channels are full color lies.
Company meets, the president speaks, 
He's young but his bones creak.
Young girl dresses for the high school dance 
And the guy next door is dying for a peek.

Get straight, you better
Yeah you better get straight, baby

I say it to you 
That you, you better, 
You better get it, babe

They put the Bible in the drawer of the motel room,
And its crying out to be read.
But is stays right there collecting dust,
No one understands what's being said.
Lovers make love in concrete boxes,
What will tomorrow bring?
They've been told that its wrong but they don't give a damn,
Soon another life it will bring

You better get straight baby

When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I laid there in the sun and felt it caressing my face

I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
The fact that me an overfed long haired leaping gnome
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie, hmmm

I stood high by the mountain tops
Naked to the world
In front of
Every kind of girl
There was long one's, tall ones, short ones, brown ones
Black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones
Out of the middle, came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy
She said,

Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl

I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
In the other a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips

The river was deep and the weather was winter
After a sailer very kindly saved me
My leader told me, you'd better take it easy
I took it so easy my leader called me lazy

Through the lack of red meat
Everything was getting hazy
Friends looked at me and said,
Man, you gotta be crazy

Oh, oh leader

My leader said son you'd better get yourself together
Never mind the fools who know what we're getting into
But a forty mile walk would do us both a world of good
And he sat down and watched me take off down the road

Well, I walked so far my feet began to bleed
If this was good for me I just couldn't see it
A motorist picked me up and said
Look man, you must be crazy

Oh, oh leader
Oh, oh leader

My leader came to see me in a hospital bed
Well at least I really knew that my leader really cared
After giving me a second-hand roach
He said where's your donation man,
It's all for a good cause.

He left me all alone to work the riddle out
But I just couldn't make it so I began to shout
They stuck a hypodermic deep down into me
Said, look out nurse I think we got a loony

Oh, oh leader
Okay baby follow me now
Follow your leader
All right

Now here I sit in a state-run asylum
Limitless, friendless but much more together
I decided to do some good book readin'
About the art of people leadin'

Now I'm the leader and they're being led

Being the leader is really where its at
But just how long can a good thing last

Did whistle and sing

Her hair like the lily
Thet grows in yon valley
She was only a hard working

The Answer,"Belfast town, could you bring me round
Like the street light swingers rope upon the ground
So we ready for a peace but we're prepared for a war
I got a black code warning splashed against the wall

In the cool red light, in the dead of the night
We wash the pain away
As the night turns into morning, and the morning into day
We wash away, wash away, wash away the pain

There's a girl that I see all alone in the street
Shell be crying on the morning that we meet
With her ripped black lace, she's got her hair out of place
But a pure intention, perfection in her face

We wash the pain away
As the night turns into morning, and the morning into day
We wash away, wash away, wash away the pain

And I return to you with a promise to renew
I will never lose sight of the cool red night
As I kill your fragile body I can never know your name

Do you remember saying we shall not be slaves?
Do you remember those good old days?
And can you remember the strength of '44?
How we united to win that war
But will you remember when the Empire is no more?

No I don't believe this is my England
No I don't believe this is my England

We chained down the lion
And let the world sit in
We build up our armies so destruction can begin
But will we ever learn the enemy lies within?

No I don't believe this is my England
No I don't believe this is my England
No I don't believe this is my England
Where are you now?

Divided we fall...United we stand

Would you like to see the lion break its chain?
Or could it ever really be the same again?

The Anti-Nowhere League,"Well gather around you boys now and listen to the man 
He says we've fought evaded but united we will stand 
We'll sacrifice the older ones living in the past 
We'll burn up their religions and we'll all be free at last 
We'll put a hat upon his head and then we'll call him God 

And then we'll share our health in him like peas do in a pod 
This is the story of a man with his future in his head 
But no-one ever listens to him when he's dead 
We're all getting older 
The light is on and bolder 
We're all getting older 

We'll follow him throughout the land obeying his command 
We'll dance a sort of hatred that we think we understand 
The children came a-running from their houses of decay 
And laid the trust upon a fool who found a better way 
He preach the words of wisdom with his hands and with his mouth 

Then everyone believed him and then he believed himself 
This is the story of a man with his future in his head 
But no-one ever listens to him when he's dead 
We're all getting older 
The light is on and bolder 

We're all getting older 
Decay 

(Spoken voice in background of Neville Chamberlain) 
 ""This morning I had another talk with the German 
 Chancellor Herr Hitler. 
 Here is the paper which bears his name upon it 
 as well as mine. We regard the agreement signed 
 last night as symbolic of the desire of our two 
 peoples never to go to war with one another again."" )

We're all getting older 
The light is on and bolder 
We're all getting older 
Decay 
The year had come and gone and everyone began to see 

Why did we follow such a fool in such a mindless way? 
Let's turn our hatred to this man - we know he's just a fraud 
We crucify him with the rest and find another God 
How many times have you heard someone's coming here to say 
That from your hell on earth that you will love until your grave 

This is the story of a man with nothing in his head 
And no-one's going to listen to you when you're dead 
We're all getting older 
The light is on and bolder 

We're all getting older 
We're all getting older

Mumma used to dance for the money they'd throw
Grandpa did whatever he could
He used to preach a little bible
And fill a couple of bottles of doctor's good

We hear it from the town

And lay their money down

Picked up this young girl while out in my car
Took her for a ride, but took her too far

The Antlers,"You've been living a while in the front of my skull, making orders
You've been writing me rules, shrinking maps and redrawing borders
I've been repeating your speeches, but the audience just doesn't follow
Because I'm leaving out words, punctuations, and it sounds pretty hollow

I've been living in bed because now you tell me to sleep
I've been hiding my voice and my face and you decide when I eat

In your dreams I'm a criminal, horrible, sleeping around
While you're awake I'm impossible, constantly letting you down

Little porcelain figurines, glass bullets you shoot at the wall
Threats of castration for crimes you imagine when I miss your call
With the bite of the teeth of that ring on my finger, I'm bound to your bedside, your eulogy singer
I'd happily take all those bullets inside you and put them inside of myself

""Someone, oh anyone, tell me how to stop this

With heavy shovels holding earth, you're being buried to you neck
In that hospital bed, being buried quite alive now
I'm trying to dig you out but all you want is to be buried there together

You're screaming
And cursing
And angry
And hurting me
And then smiling
And crying
Apologizing

I've woken up, I'm in our bed, but there's no breathing body there beside me
Someone must have taken you while I was stuck asleep
But I know better as my eyes adjust
You've been gone for quite a while now, and I don't work there in the hospital
(They had to let me go)

When I try to move my arms sometimes, they weigh too much to lift
I think you buried me awake (my one and only parting gift)
But you return to me at night just when I think I may have fallen asleep

It made you feel so alone
So you told me
I had to be leaving

But something kept me standing
By that hospital bed
I should have quit but instead
I took care of you

You made me sleep all uneven
And I didn't believe them
When they told me that there
Was no saving you",Kettering,2009

And the monitors beeped the last time
Hundreds of thousands of hospital beds
And all of them empty but mine

Well, I was lying down with my feet in the air
Completely unable to move
The bed was misshaped, and awkward and tall
And clearly intended for you

You checked yourself out when you put me to bed
And tore that old band off your wrist
But you came back to see me for a minute or less
And left me your ring in my fist
My hair started growing, my face became yours
My femur was breaking in half
The sensation was scissors and too much to scream
So instead, I just started to laugh

Suddenly every machine stopped at once
And the monitors beeped the last time

The Antlers,"In the middle of the night I was sleeping sitting up
When a doctor came to tell me, ""Enough is enough""
He brought me out into the hall (I could have sworn it was haunted)
And told me something that I didn't know that I wanted to hear
That there was nothing that I could do to save you
The choir's going to sing, and this thing is going to kill you
Something in my throat made my next words shake
And something in the wires made the lightbulbs break
There was glass inside my feet and raining down from the ceiling
It opened up the scars that had just finished healing
It tore apart the canyon running down your femur
(I thought that it was beautiful, it made me a believer)
And as it opened I could hear you howling from your room
But I hid out in the hall until the hurricane blew
When I reappeared and tried to give you something for the pain
You came to hating me again and just sang your refrain

You had a new dream, it was more like a nightmare
You were just a little kid, and they cut your hair
Then they stuck you in machines, you came so close to dying
They should have listened, they thought that you were lying
Daddy was an asshole, he fucked you up
Built the gears in your head, now he greases them up
And no one paid attention when you just stopped eating
""Eighty-seven pounds!"" and this all bears repeating

Tell me when you think that we became so unhappy
Wearing silver rings with nobody clapping
When we moved here together we were so disappointed
Sleeping out of tune with our dreams disjointed
It killed me to see you getting always rejected
But I didn't mind the things you threw, the phones I deflected
I didn't mind you blaming me for your mistakes
I just held you in the door-frame through all of the earthquakes
But you packed up your clothes in that bag every night
And I would try to grab your ankles (what a pitiful sight)
But after over a year, I stopped trying to stop you
From stomping out that door
Coming back like you always do
Well no one's going to fix it for us, no one can
You say that, ""No one's going to listen, and no one understands""

So there's no open doors and there's no way to get through
There's no other witnesses, just us two

There's two people living in one small room
From your two half-families tearing at you
Two ways to tell the story (no one worries)
Two silver rings on our fingers in a hurry
Two people talking inside your brain
Two people believing that I'm the one to blame
Two different voices coming out of your mouth
While I'm too cold to care and too sick to shout

You had a new dream, it was more like a nightmare
You were just a little kid, and they cut your hair
Then they stuck you in machines, you came so close to dying

I've go the keys, I'm letting people in

Don't speak with someone's tooth
Don't bargain when you're weak
Don't take that sharp abuse
Some patients can't be saved
But that burden's not on you

So then we lie down in our field and just do nothing at all

For just a couple pairs of broken bones with broken feathers in blood
In a meadow, uncut and understood

We can be an island apart from a ceaseless war on our heart
Harbored in a fortress insurmountable
Taller than affliction, safe wherever we are
Erasing horror and disgust
Rewinding the sorrow and the rust
Before our suffering’s suffering, hadn’t we suffered enough?

On the morning that we're both 19 and newly on our own
And all we know is “each other” and invisible homes

Where all our bridges are abandoned and the cops have forgot

So when they asked me for directions, I sold them our map
I sold our shovels and our flashlights

It's February, you're two years gone
And I am lost
Its February, I can feel your hand
And here I come

You cannot hide yourself, I'm everywhere

The Appleseed Cast,"Father now, listen close.
You have become another ghost, 
Just like me.
Just like me.

Now flowers fall from your glass, 
A bitter taste, 
The girl is back
In dancing lights.

Dancing lights, flowers fall.
A bitter taste, the glass if full

An empty hand.

Dancing lights, 
Flowers float, 
Bitter taste, 
The glass is full.
An empty hand.

An empty set of colors crawl
Through the door and to the hall, 
The knife is dull.
The knife is dull.",Mountain Halo,2006
The Appleseed Cast,"On your own, come back
Give a call, contact
So alive, sidetracked
So alone, come back
Decide

I don't know
What to do, to show you
It's something so old
And its cold, like a stone

All that's said
All that's said
Could you just shake in a lie?
With a knife in your side

When you come back to me
You will be on your knees
With wounded hands

In fortresses
It's only rain

Come out from your cave
You can not be defeated

although I might not be on the right track.Oh, thought I might drown but its hard to be givin'. Downtown's wheres you'll find me, do 
some and got a hand. Although I never listen girl, I damn well understand. And you think, I'm so damn feeble. I can't see through 
your lies, you'r just a crock of shit, with a pretty smile, and I refuse to compromise. Oh, don't give me such a heavy, heavy, heavy 
load. You may hold some vision of truth, if truth can found in a lie. Maybe some grain of inspiration, for song thats deep inside. Oh, 
tears running down your face, just screaming look me in the eye. Well I'm looking straight at your twisted face, and it's enough to 
make me cry.Oh, I payed the price of loving you, in more ways than one. Wrapped around your finger, but I think my time has 
come,but I never can be too sure, cuz I like to have a little fun.Oh, what fun it would be to blow my mind and fall into the sun. A 
mind is a precious thing to taste. ",New Realization,2006
The Aquabats,"We came from an island
In the sand and the sun
Hidden away from the world
Is that home of fun
We surfed all day
And ate food all night
When there was no more food
Eating sand was alright

But then one dark day out of the sky
Space Monster ""M"" and friends
Invaded our world
And we had to escape
But we vowed to return again
First we'd take over the world
And then we'd return again

We floated across the ocean
In a hollowed out log
From the blue beaches
To the land of smog
We washed up on the beach
The Professor took us in
And that's when the experiments begin
He gave us super powers from chemicals
Then he gave us instruments
So we could rock and roll

Now we're here to fight
To make our foes and friends
To take your money and go home again

Come fight along
We're the Aquabats
We're super super guys
We're the Aquabats
Join in our journey to battle our foes.
Watch us every week
On our TV show.
The wacky wacky world
Of the Aquabats.
We're zippy, zippy dudes
We're the Aquabats
We're the Aquabats
And that's that
So watch us every week

Drippin, but nobody's slippin

With the wave of your hand and then say ""ho""

Throw your hands in the air... 'til you feel weak
Yeah then you shake it, 'til you can't take it
If you get tired move around and fake it
And stop....and do a dance or two
So everybody in the place can get wild
With to the program, this is a show-jam
Ask me to stop, and I'll say ""no ma'am""
Tell the DJ to turn it up a little louder

Just get into the floor instead of waxin, the sound
No time to sit down...

From intro to intro you know
That the size of the crowd will grow, large

Lain by my side & climbed in my mind

Why should it be so bad to be bad,
When it´s so hard to be anything at all?
And why does everyone seem to forget
What it´s like to be all alone
As soon as they
Have got someone, oh it´s no fun
It makes me want to vanish and die
Maybe I´ll throw all my clothes
Into a waterfall
And sit and spy whilenthey all cry
You get so silly when you´re lonely
And you think that you´re the only
Who´ll say:

I hope that someone´s gonna call
And tell me this night is over
'Cause I want to start living my life
Before I get much older

Maybe you all would consider it a joke
If I say that I hate myself
But now and then
When I look into the mirror
All I see is a big mistake
(And wouldn´t you)
Well, I just want to be fun
Just want to be the one
Who makes you smile

That I could be something to someone

Who´s not gonna live my life in fear?

I'd even grab a tiger by the tail
I would make fun of
A boxing champion's mother
But my courage and my bowels both would fail
I would fight off a bunch
Of angry Kosacks
I would stop a thousand
Bullets with my hand
I would laugh
As my leg was amputated..
But baby, I'm not that kind of man!

'Cause it's too dangerous (too dangerous)
I use big words
But I never do the deed
It's dangerous (too dangerous)

Until your heart
When we walk through open doorways
Counting time in one or more ways
We can't find our peace of mind
And life becomes a life of crime

I came to you, I called in vain

I've been good and I've been bad
But common sense I've never had
No matter how I try and try
I hide the truth behind a lie
But that's the way that I can win
A victim of your evil sin
You lost the faith within your heart
The fire in your soul from the end to the start

That's strung on a string
An' I wear 'em like I'm wearin' a necklace
Women love me, n'think lots of me
Really! How can they be so reckless
I tell 'em in front, that I do love money
So - later on - then they won't get funny
When I tighten up an' the scene gets heavy
Times when I laugh they're over
Now they're gonna' feel a draf'

From dusk till dawn
You don't need experience
To turn me out

You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss

You got to not talk dirty, baby
If you wanna impress me
You can't be too flirty, mama
I know how to undress me
Let me be your fantasy
And maybe, you can be mine
You just leave it all up to me
We could have a good time

You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss

I think I'd better dance now

Women and girls rule my world
I said they rule my world
Act your age woman, not your shoe size
Maybe we could do the twirl

You gotta leave it all up to me

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2012
The Arthur Norman Chorus & Orchestra,"Here we are, out of cigarettes, 
Holding hands and yawning, 
Look how late it gets. 
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light, 
And too much in love to say goodnight. 

Here we are, in a cozy chair; 
Pickin' on a wishbone from the frigidaire. 
Two sleepy people with nothing to say, 
And too much in love to break away. 

Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall? 
Your father didn't like me at all. 
Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall? 
To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest. 

Well, here we are just about the same, 
Foggy little fella, drowsy little dame. 
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light, 
And too much in love to say goodnight.

I watched the lonely cry
You danced in iron cages
For the boys with hungry eyes

I swore I'd come back for you
Come back and buy this town

Ayo my mental is keep the rock cut keep the glock up
Keep the rock pucks in the basement with the lock shut
Used to sliding under street lights with the peace pipe
Keep the heat tight by my side so I can eat right
All I knew is hit the block and how to crack deals
Make it hot with this rap shit and stack bills
All I'm used to is struggling juggling bugging
With thoughts in my head knowing crack kills
Out for papes gotta let the desert eagle blow
I get cake, this rap shit is legal though
Check the resume, slit that spit that
I put my name in the game Mr. Book
I'ma shine till a nigga can't shine no more
I'ma smoke so much weed I can't find no more

Ayo we bash in brains
Then hit a nigga pockets for the last of his change
Then put a slash through his veins
Bullies of the block we harass in the game
With a sound that so hot it turn gas into flames
Keep jumping around like my raps entertain
Fuck around get beat down with some bats and some chains
When y'all was on them lots dropping cash on the range
I was tongue kissing blocks stashing them things
And now my nigga on only half of the chains
See the corners in the past but my ass is still deranged
I rumble in your ear like that flash when it rains
When I hits ya get the picture
Knock the glass out the frame
Rap for the name dope crack and cocaine
And I'ma drill it in your ear so you can lapse from the pain
And after the fame I'm going back to the wane
But for now nigga, feel the wrath from my game

Show the world how we live how we feel we get down
That's my mission show up in my diction
Rep Baltimore every show till there's tension
Hate the fact that we iron we just go hard
High confidence got us feeling that we should bogard
Take over like bush did the poll sheets
A lot of rappers falling off 'cause the flow weak
That's what we here for to bring competition
Battle anybody we them four lynchmen

Someone calls on me
And every now and then I spend my time in rhyme and verse
And curse those faults in me

And then along comes Mary
And does she want to give me kicks , and be my steady chick
And give me pick of memories
Or maybe rather gather tales of all the fails and tribulations
No one ever sees

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks
Whose sickness is the games they play
And when the masquerade is played and neighbor folks make jokes
As who is most to blame today

And then along comes Mary
And does she want to set them free, and let them see reality
From where she got her name
And will they struggle much when told that such a tender touch as hers
Will make them not the same

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

And when the morning of the warning's passed, the gassed
And flaccid kids are flung across the stars
The psychodramas and the traumas gone
The songs are left unsung and hung upon the scars

And then along comes Mary
And does she want to see the stains, the dead remains of all the pains
She left the night before
Or will their waking eyes reflect the lies, and make them
Realize their urgent cry for sight no more

Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch",Along Comes Mary,1966

My heart it clearly states, the answer's not in hate
I once believed that love was but a dream
But now I know that love's a flowing stream
They're lying, killing, they're pushing their rules
They tell you the prophets all are just fools
But I know different and I won't be used
It's they that are lost, it's they are confused

Sunrise, sunset
What you're born with is what you get
All your worries, all your fears
They don't change the passing years

I tell her I love her

She makes me feel like sunshine when she says my name

Her laughing, her crying
Her caring, her sharing
Of my life means more to me
Than all the wealth and fame that fortune brings to me

Does the question count when you feel good
As good inside as I do, do you?

Far enough to tell you that I love you
But I know I'm stupid
Just because I run right back to you.
I got your letters yesterday
But I don't have a thing to say,
So I'll nail 'em to my wall

Why do you believe that everything I say is
True?

Why do I put myself through this?
Love is blind and so unkind...
I never can make up my mind!
I undo the thought from my head,

Did you go, did you run, did you think of
Your son?
Did you know you're not the only one

That tried to make a piece of coal into a 
Diamond yeah!
So everything's fine now, at least you say
Maybe that's o.k.

But you know it's 
Wrong
Was I right, did it last?
Were you dwelling on the past?

When it comes to your ex-boyfriends,

Lately I've been thinking 'bout
Stickin' my hand in a toaster.
I never asked to take a ride 
On this emotional roller-coaster.
It's you that I want,
And lately it feels like you're not there.

Lately I've been contemplating 
Jumping in the ocean.
Sometimes even Spock would show
A little more emotion!

As much as you loved me yesterday?

Shout today,
But the wall wouldn't listen to me!

I'm sick of always cryin'
I don't want to be sick of trying,
But you've gotta want me too.

Lately I've been hoping for 
A little bit of affection.
Sometimes I wish that you had came
With your own set of directions.
I guess it's not that easy,
But I hope that you still love me anyway.

Lately I've been thinkin' 'bout
Takin' a vow of silence,
I've never seen a monk result
In any acts of violence.
Or, maybe I'll just cry
And hope you come around again today.

Should I say goodnight??? 
...go to bed, turn out the fucking light and leave you shining in the past. Should I try and forget??? 
...even though next week it's something I'll regret. Or, should I try and make it last?

You were my best friend, and I never ever thought those days would end but now it seems like they are gone.

I'm gonna speak my mind. 
You should speak your mind!

Until his lethal dose.

But in the end it was the only thing we could be.

Angie, I'm sorry I wasn't right for you
Just what did you expect for me to do?
You know that I would have done anything for you.

I sometimes think about how things could be
If you would've took a chance and moved out here with me.
We'd cruise along the 101 in the California sun
Sing Descendants songs and have ourselves lots of fun.
Stay out drinking really late, stumble home from lower State.

going through your head

In this small new england town.
Here's to you my best friend.
Just wanted to say that I miss
Having you around.

I'm staring at your picture
And dreaming that I could hold your hand.
We'd walk down to the ocean
And I would write your name in the sand.

They say sometimes you need some time apart
But I've got a bad case of broken heart.
And you're the only one who's got the cure.
And I can't live another day without seeing you smile.

2000 miles between us and I guess that I'm the one to blame.

Just nostalgia and I,
We were sure to have a blast,

Wrote our names in wet cement,
And for a moment remembered how it felt,
To have no one understand,
That there's this dream,
And they're not part of it,
How soon we do forget.

But the piano lingers on,
And so does the fire that,
Burned it to the ground,

But you can't take away all my love for the day.

To all our past regrets. I'm sorry to inform you
But I doubt you'll really ever understand.

In this game of disrespect
I'm a victim a small town tragedy.

Here's the difference between you and I
I'll tell the truth and count my blessings
So thanks for all you've done
But I won't let you get the best of me.

You think I'm just a kid but
You don't fucking get it.
I'm strong in my conviction
And don't you forget it.

So many things are left unsaid
But I won't even waste my time
For us to go our separate ways
I hope you miss me when I'm gone.

Friendships aren't built on false promises.
I've failed without defeat.
In this game of disrespect
I'm a victim of small town rivalry.

Farewell to all my friends
With self respect intact.
Nothing will last forever
Never looking back.

What it's like to be a kid today.

Another night we'll be
Staying in some crack hotel
And sneaking everyone in
Through the bathroom window.

Gonna blow up everything in sight
And get chased away into the night
By some crazy bastard with a
Shotgun in his hand.

Outside your home that night
Got in the bed and stayed there
For days I just laid there

You should've seen me smiling

It's like the world was mine

Softly, sometimes
But if I dwell on those days tonight

I feel like my life is over 
And that's not good
So let's move on
To the part where I began to sense

Her distance
I've barely can hold on tighter
And that makes it worse cause how am I supposed to take it when she says
""It's just something I'm going through, it's got nothing to do with you""

I had a special evening all planned out
Desperately determined to re-ignite
Some spark between us 
She had to feel something for me

A love as strong as ours doesn't Just go away 
Can't just turn it off
Unless she was lying all those times
I don't think so, I really don't think so

The way she used to look at me made Me a thousand feet high 
The meaning of the word cool 
Not the same geek who fumbled with His words that night 
The ugliest night

I said some pretty awkward things
I got the feel she felt sorry for me
I should've seen it was hopeless And left it alone but I had to go on embarrassing myself
I miss what we had I need you so badly

I must've sounded pretty pathetic I know
And that's why I don't blame her for what she said

I wish that boats were little glasses filled with wine
So I could drink to love with all your friends and mine
Some day we'll pull your boat ashore
The day you sail away no more

My friend the sea says you'll be mine
The day I fill your boat with wine
And so I dream of what w'll be
And I believe my friend the sea

I wish the mountain was smaller than a star
So I could see your boat and know just where you are
I wish my arms were nuts of gold
For you are all I want to hold

My friend the sea says you'll be mine
The day I fill your boat with wine
And so I dream of what w'll be
And I believe my friend the sea
Some day I'll fill your boat with wine
My friend the sea will know you're mine

I've got this harlot that I'm stuck with carrying another man's child
The solitary star announcing vacancy burnt out as we arrived
They'd throw us back across the border if they knew that we survived

And they were surprised to see us
So they greeted us with palms
They asked for ammunition, acts of contrition and small alms
I might recite a small prayer

If I ever said them
I lay down on an iron frame
Found myself in bedlam
I wish that I could take something for drowning out the noise

Wailing echoes down the corridors
I've got this imaginary radio, and I'm punching up the dial
I've got the A.C. trained on the T.V. so it won't blow up in my eye
And everything that I thought fanciful and mocked as too extreme

Must be family entertainment here in the strange land of my dreams
Now I'm practicing my likeness of St. Francis of Assisi
For if I hold my hand outstretched
A little bird comes to me

I might recite a small prayer
If I ever said them
I lay down on an iron frame
Found myself in bedlam

Escaping from the fingers that were stretching through the bars
Wailing echoes down the corridors
The player piano picks out ""Life Goes On""
Ring tone rang out ""Jerusalem""

And in this pit of sadness
Where the rank of wretched plunge
We've buried all the innocents
Now we must bury revenge

They've got this scared and decorated girl strapped to the steel trunk of a mustang
And then they drove her down a cypress grove where traitors hang and stars still spangle
They dangled flags and other rags along a colored thread of twine
And then they dragged that bruised and purple heart along the road to Palestine

Someone went off muttering, he mentioned thirty pieces
Easter saw a slaughtering, each wrapped in bloodstained fleeces
Then my thoughts returned to vengeance, but I put up no resistance
Though I seemed a long way from my home

It really was no distance
And I might recite a small prayer
If I ever said them
I lay down on an iron frame

Till you question what I'm saying
Make me justify

Every word in every line
That does not seem to fit
But the meaning's not so important
As long as you mean it

Borrowed time and missing faces
No home in a million places
I don't want a change of pace
I can't do anything else

Borrowed time and missing faces
No home in a million places
I don't want a change of pace
I can't do anything else

The life that I wanted
Is frozen in motion
The life that I wanted
Is frozen in motion

Borrowed time and missing faces
No home in a million places
I don't want a change of pace
I can't do anything else

Borrowed time and missing faces
No home in a million places
I don't want a change of pace
I can't do anything else

I can't do anything else
I can't do anything else
I can't do anything else

The Automatic,"Have I become a recluse?
What is it that other people do that doesn't leave a bruise?
He's smirking under his skin
Our divide is steel but paper thin, I'm breaking through

I remember someone say that there's always a rat close by
I remember someone say that there's always a rat close by
And I think it?s time that you made up your mind
Decide who's still on your side?

I'm six feet over my head
The concept of privacy is dead but I'm here alone
If everyone in the room
Could hear themselves sing out of tune then they'd feel like I do

I remember someone say that there's always a rat close by

The Automatic,"What can I say?
I've got no room to complain
Every mistake I made was out, okay

But you're asking me questions
Making suggestions
Telling me how to do what I do best
Considering we don't play requests
It's nice to see you're taking some interest

Things are playing on my mind
I can't wait to leave behind
This small place

Walking crisis
Make sure everyone knows your pain
Keep a surprise not your private lives
To make sure we're all entertained

And it's a shame that shit goes wrong
But it happens to the rest of us
Considering we don't play requests
It's nice to see you're taking some interest

Things are playing on my mind
I'll be here till closing time
I can't wait to leave behind
This small place

Drama, go team, go team, go team, go
Drama, go team, go team, go team, go
Drama, go team, go team, go team, go
Drama, go team, go team, go team, go

Things are playing on my mind
I'll be here till closing time
I can't wait to leave behind

So punk is dead and this is so new
Your revolution cooked up in a boardroom
Like the message on your t-shirt
I don't know what it means but the colors really work

Pack up your accents, pack up your batteries

",That's What She Said,2006
The Automatic,"What happened to us we used to be so confident
That thing's would be okay
I never realized that something was wrong
Til a part of me had started to decay

Feel like a rocket without fuel
I fail to breathe, escape velocity
Come crashing down, sucked in by my whole world
A fucking tragedy

Tonight, it's time to leave this town
And get out of here
It's too late to try and start again
So get out of here

What happened to you
You never replied to my letter
I don't know if you're alive or dead
Never forget those feelings
It's like I am feeling it all again

You never really forget
You never really forget
You never really forget
You never really forget
(repeat)

Tonight, it's time to leave this town
And get out of here
It's too late to try and start again
