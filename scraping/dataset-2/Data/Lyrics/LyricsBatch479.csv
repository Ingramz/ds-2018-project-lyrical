John Farnham,"Show me the magic
I must have lost it somewhere
In my dreams, so far away
I turn around
Everything's changing but me 
Where is the soul in my song

Once there was heaven in my eyes
Whatever happened to those skies
Somebody show me how to get back 
To a simple life

Out of the blue
Temptation's all around me
Train came along, and I got on board
Danced with the darkness
Skies were the limit
But it's such a long way to fall
 
Once there was heaven in my eyes
Whatever happened to those skies
Somebody show me how to get back 
To a simple life

I've done my time in paradise
I tried it all maybe once or twice
To a simple life

Stars keep me goin'
And the moon is there to light my way
I need to go where my heart is free
Lookin' for the way back
Hopin' to get back to me

Once there was heaven in my eyes
Whatever happened to those skies
Somebody show me how to get back 
To a simple life
",A Simple Life,1996
John Farnham,"The touch of your hand will let me know
You take me in and let me go
If not for love why would we meet
How is it done two into one so easily

We're lifted up by angels
Higher than the world
Strong enough to leave it
Bound to learn the secrets
Angels never heard
Close enough to heaven
Above the rain
Darkness cannot reach us
Let the angels teach us
Only love remains
We're lifted up by angels

You understand yet never say
How every plan would fade away
If not for love where would you be
Ashes to dust water to rust away from me

We're lifted up by angels
Higher than the world
Strong enough to leave it
Bound to learn the secrets
Angels never heard
Close enough to heaven
Above the rain
Darkness cannot reach us
Let the angels teach us
Only love remains
We're lifted up by angels

We're lifted up by angels
Given wings to fly
Leave the night behind us
Trust the light to find us
Even as we rise
We're lifted up by angels

Close enough to heaven
Above the rain
Darkness cannot reach us
Let the angels teach us
Only love remains
We're lifted up by angels
Higher than the world
Strong enough to leave it
Bound to learn the secrets
Angels never heard
We're lifted up by angels

John Farnham,"Never before have I seen you look so blue 
Can't find a cure and nothing comforts you 
The light at the end of the tunnel 
Doesn't shine at the end of the day 

[Chorus]
Every time you cry 
Save up all your tears 
I will be your rainbow when they disappear 
Wash away the pain 
'til you smile again 
I will be the laughter in your eyes 
Every time you cry Every time you cry 

Time has a way of wounding what has healed 
What can I say, I know just how you feel 
Your soul is dark and troubled 
Like a river running wild 

[Chorus]
Well you know that's what I'm here for 
And I will give you when you need more 
There'll be no hesitation 
I will reap no reward 

[Chorus: x2]",Every Time You Cry,1997
John Farnham,"Ross Wilson, John Farnham, and Ross Fraser
I've been a fool, I have been cruel
You put your faith in me
Ask myself why, no alibi

Now that you're facing me
Did things my way, I've had my say
Sometimes I crossed that line
But it seemed like a good idea

Seemed like a good idea at the time
I know I was wrong, I'm holding on
Learning is hard to do
It's not too late, if you will wait

I'll make it up to you
If you refuse, then I will lose
I let our life unwind
But it seemed like a good idea

Seemed like a good idea at the time
Seemed like the ring thing
'Til I watched you go
Seemed like the right thing

But I lost control
Out in the darkness I saw a light
And now I know
A bitter taste has taken the place

Of kisses that were so sweet
Open my eyes, I realise
My lesson is complete
If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it

Sometimes I crossed that line
But it seemed like a good idea
Seemed like a good idea at the time
It seemed like a good idea

Seemed like a good idea at the time
Did things my way, I've had my say
Sometimes I crossed the line
But it seemed like a good idea

Seemed like a good idea at the time

Seemed like a good idea at the time",Seemed Like a Good Idea (At the Time),1997

The sun goes down on a cloudless sky
The tide is in the waters high
The fisherman are back in town
Tonight they'll either drink or drown

Wait for rain to come down
Wait for rain all year round
It's the talk of the town, goin' 'round

If you're ever in that gulf country
Strangest land you've seen
Sun's so hot the ground's on fire
Thermometer won't go no higher

Wait for rain to come down
Wait for rain all year round
It's the talk of the town, goin' 'round

If you want to lose those lonely blues
You best put on your dancing shoes
The ringers make for the water hole
Tonight the town will rock 'n roll

Wait for rain to come down
Wait for rain all year round
It's the talk of the town, goin' 'round

Now, murray knows this ancient land
Like the back of his own hand
See the brolga on the plain
Thousands dancing, bring the pain

And that rain coming down
Hear that rain what a mighty sound
It's the talk of the town, coming down

And that rain coming down
Hear that rain what a mighty sound
It's the talk of the town, coming down

Surely you know I always want to be there
Holding your hand and standing by to catch you when you fall

Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
Let me take you through that wonderland that only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there

Watching you grow and going thru the changes in your life

I wait alone in the heat
I know know that you have your way
'Til you have to go home.
""No"" 's a word I can't say.

But it gets me nowhere to tell you ""no""
It gets me nowhere to make you go
Will a little more love make you
Star depending
Will a little more love
Bring a happy ending
Will a little more love make it right
Will a little more love make it right.

Where did my innocence go
How, how was a young girl to know
I'm trapped, trapped in the spell of your eyes
In the warmth of your arms
In the web of your lies.

But it gets me nowhere to tell you ""no""",A Little More Love,1998
John Farnham,"Raindrops are falling on my head 
I'm just like a guy whose feet are too big for his bed 
Nothin' seems to fit 
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling

So I just did me some talking to the sun 
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done 
Sleeping on the job 
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling

But there's one thing I know 
The blues they send to meet me won't defeat me 
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me 

'Cause raindrops keep falling on my head 
Haha, but that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red 
Cryin's not for me 
Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Because I'm free
Nothings worrying me

Raindrops keep falling on my head 
Ha, but that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red

Tell me more, tell me more
Was it love at first sight?
Tell me more, tell me more
Did she put up a fight?

Took her bowling in the arcade
We went strolling drank lemonade
We made out under the dock
We stayed out till 10 o'clock
Summer fling don't mean a thing but oh oh the summer nights.

Tell me more, tell me more
But you don't gotta brag
Tell me more, tell me more
Cause he sounds like a drag

He got friendly holding my hand
She got friendly down in the sand
He was sweet just turned eighteen
Well she was good you know what I mean
Summer heat boy and girl meet but oh oh the summer nights.

Tell me more, tell me more
How much dough did he spend?
Tell me more, tell me more
Could she get me a friend?

It's turning you into
What you don't want to be
A lonely man

You hide yourself away
You hide inside your head
Don't you know that life
Is never what you plan
I know what you've been through
But no-one wants to see
A lonely man
You'll be, a lonely man

There's nothing wrong with you
That can't be fixed right here
You only have to want to
Nothing anyone can say
To make you less scared
But you know the truth
That you gotta do
What you gotta do
To make it through

So open up your eyes
Please don't close your heart
You can restart the fire
All you need's the spark
After all you've been through
You still don't need to be
A lonely man

Don't be the lonely, (lonely man)
Don't be a lonely, (lonely man)
Don't be a lonely man, (lonely man)

John Farnham,"What kind of fool throws away a chance
That may never come again
The chance to forgive and forget
What good is pride when it clears the room

Leaves you standing on your own
I'm not so proud that i don't know
No I don't want to leave and just say goodbye
Don't want to miss what I left behind

Will you stay with me now, give me one more try
One more try
I know sometimes I don't say enough
Don't seem to let my feelings show

But I can say honestly I know
I remember when faith was all we had
We dreamed together and dreams are something that I still have
What kind of fool closes all the doors

And says they're feeling all alone
I've been alone enough to know
Yes I know",One More Try,2002
John Farnham,"Sometimes I feel folded, like a piece of paper
Dirty with the fingerprints of unrepentant hands
Who never ever thinks about the words of love inside me
'Cause it's all so plain and simple thatno-one understands

Sometimes I feel congested like peak hour in the city
Choking on the petrol and the deisel and the dust
I sit and wonder how we all could be so stupid
And I want toleave my vehicle and let it turn to rust

And I wish I had your confidence
I wish I had your smile
I wish I had your joie de vivre
Your innate sense of style
And I wish I had your body near me
Warming up my nights
Saying oooh babe, baby it's alright

Sometimes I feel miniscule just like an amoeba
Floating on a plate of glass watched by unseen eyes
And I feel so cold and lonely in that instant of existence
And I wonder if someone's watching me up above the sky

Perhaps there are no solutions
Perhaps just other questions
Maybe there's a meaning to my solitary life
And I know that there's no guarantees
There's just the pain of living
Perhaps there are no solutions
Maybe there's just life

There's no use hiding it

Every time I have to close my eyes

I'm only make believing
I'm only self deceiving
Tell me how could I
Tell myself a lie
Dreaming is all I do
When I can't have you

Someone else can hold you like I want to
Someone else can really make you cry
Wish I could find a way to make it better
But I know that I couldn't even try

If I could be the only one that you'll come running to
If I could make the past undone I would

All the pain you put me through starts to melt away

Keep talking
The words may lead you back into my arms
Baby, make it real, tell me how you really feel
Keep talking, keep talking, I'm listening

I can feel the magic coming back again

John Farnham,"The late George Wallno worked on High Street and lived on manners
52 years he sat on his verandah, made his saddles

You just asked the saddler, he lived without sin
They're building a library for him

Time is a traveller

Right again jackaroo, think I see kangaroo up ahead

The son of George Wallno went off and got married and had a war baby
But something was wrong and it's easier to drink than go crazy
And if there were questions about why the end was so sad
Well George had no answers about why her son ever has need of a gun

Time is a traveller

Turn your head
Right again jackaroo, think I see kangaroo up ahead

The grandson of George has been all around the world and lives no special place
Changed his last name and he married a girl with an interesting face
He'd almost forgotten them both because of the life that he leads
There's nowhere for George and his library or the son with his gun to belong

Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay

In fields where they lay
Keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night

And saw a star
Shining bright in the east
Beyond them far

And to the earth
It gave great light
And so it continued
Both day and night

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And it's what I've got to face
Take a look at me now",Against All Odds [All'ultimo Respiro],1995
John Ferrara,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2005
John Ferraro,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,1989

But when it comes to figures, that's where I'm not so fine
A girl told me last night, I didn't know where to ""draw the line""
Oh, it comes in handy being a handy man
Now in the park one morning, a bulldog I did see
I fairly stood and shivered when it came and sniffed at me
I didn't even move when it mistook me for a tree

They call me Andy, George Andy, Andy the handy man
My job is dandy, dandy, I do the best I can

He isn't like his mother or his father you can tell
Who does the child remind you of? And the choir began to yell,
""Oh, it comes in handy being a handy man""

A girl gave me a gold watch, I said ""its rather light
Its got no works inside it, now surely that's not right""
She said ""now don't you worry, Ill give you the works tonight""
Oh, it comes in handy being a handy man

John Fogerty,"They sent us home to watch the show comin' on the little screen
A man named Ike was in the white house, big black limousine
There were many shows to follow, from 'Hooter' to Doodyville
Though I saw them all, I can't recall which cartoon was real

The coon-skin caps, Yankee bats, the Hound Dog man's big start
The A-Bomb fears, Annette had ears, I lusted in my heart
A young man from Boston set sail the new frontier
And we watched the Dream dead-end in Dallas
They buried innocence that year

I know it's true, oh so true
'Cause I saw it on TV

We gathered round to hear the sound comin' on the little screen
The grief had passed, the old men laughed, and all the girls screamed
'Cause four guys from England took us all by the hand
It was time to laugh, time to sing, time to join the band

But all too soon, we hit the moon, and covered up the sky
They built their bombs, and aimed their guns, and still I don't know why
The dominoes tumbled and big business roared
Every night at six, they showed the pictures and counted up the score

I know it's true, oh so true
'Cause I saw it on TV

The old man rocks among his dreams, a prisoner of the porch
""The light"" he says
""At the end of the tunnel was nothin', but a burglar's torch""
And them that was caught in the cover are all rich and free
But they chained my mind to an endless tomb
When they took my only son from me

'Cause I saw it on TV
I know it's true, oh so true
'Cause I saw it on TV",I Saw It on T.V.,1985

Mr. Greed, why you put a chain on everybody livin' free?
You're hungerin' for his house, you're hungerin' for his wife
And your appetite will never be denied
You're a devil of consumption
I hope you choke, Mr. Greed

How do you get away with robbin'?
Did your mother teach you how?
I hear you got away with murder
Did you do your Mama proud?

Mr. Greed, why you got to take more than you can ever use?
Bring 'em to their knees
Isn't it enough just to win while they lose?

But then the path disappears
Here in the darkness, I'm runnin' blind

Somethin's happenin' here.
Change in the weather, change in the weather,
People walkin' round in fear.

Uh huh, you better duck and run,
Get under cover 'cause the change has come.
Storm warning, and it looks like rain,
Be nothin' left after the hurricane.
This here's a jungle, ain't no lie,
Look at the people, terror in their eyes.
Bad business comin', can't be denied,
They're running with the dogs, afraid to die.

The levee's busted, badness comin' through.

Won't be no blessing if we make it through the night.

Kick up my feet in the shade out back

Touch the moon, touch the sky

John Fogerty,"There's a storm across the valley, clouds are rollin' in
The afternoon is heavy on your shoulders
There's a truck out on the four lane, a mile or more away
The whinin' of his wheels just makes it colder

He's an hour away from ridin' on your prayers up in the sky
Ten days on the road are barely gone
There's a fire softly burnin', suppers on the stove
It's the light in your eyes that makes him warm

Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

There's all the news to tell him, how'd you spend your time
What's the latest thing the neighbors say?
And your mother called last Friday, sunshine made her cry
You felt the baby move just yesterday

Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

Oh, the time that I can lay this tired old body down
Feel your fingers feather soft upon me
The kisses that I live for, the love that lights my way
The happiness that livin' with you brings me

It's the sweetest thing I know of, just spending time with you
It's the little things that make a house a home
Like a fire softly burnin' and supper on the stove
The light in your eyes that makes me warm

John Fogerty,"I went to a garden party to reminisce with my old friends
A chance to share old memories and play our songs again
When I got to the garden party, they all knew my name
No one recognized me, I didn't look the same

But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, ya can't please everyone, so ya got to please yourself

And people came from miles around, everyone was there
Yoko brought her walrus, there was magic in the air
An' over in the corner, much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan's shoes wearing his disguise

But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, ya can't please everyone, so ya got to please yourself

Played them all the old songs, thought that's why they came
No one heard the music, we didn't look the same
I said, hello to ""Mary Lou"", she belongs to me
When I sang a song about a honky-tonk, it was time to leave

But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, ya can't please everyone, so ya got to please yourself

Someone opened up a closet door and out stepped Johnny B. Goode

Moving was hot but I got squared away
Bells started ringing and chains rattled loud

Still I made up in my mind to stay
Nothing was a gonna drive me away
When I seen something that gave me the creep
Had a one big eye and two big feet

I stood right still and I did the freeze
And he did the stroll right up to me
Made a sound with his feet like a drum

I'll be right here and I ain't gonna run

The coffee was a boiling in the pot
The grease had melted in my pan
I had a hunk of meet in my hand

From out of space, there sat a man
On a hot stove was pots and pans
Say, that's hot, I began to shout
He drank a hot coffee from the spout

He ate the raw meat right from my hand
Drank the hot grease from the frying pan
He said to me, Now you better run

Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn

""And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the green river where paradise lay?""
""Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away""

Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Adrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

""And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the green river where paradise lay?""
""Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away""

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

""And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the green river where paradise lay?""
""Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away""

Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am

Counting stars and flowers

John Ford Coley,"Happy times, like pens and dimes
They slip away, you turn around
They're gone one day, but I'll stay

Empty words, like winter birds
They leave the nest, they join the rest
Then fly away, but I'll stay

I'll be there in the morning
When you wake up, I'll be by your side
I'll be there in the evening
With your soul in mine
I'll be there in the morning
From the moment you begin to rise
I'll be there in the evening
Keep you satisfied, satisfied

Fairweather friends, like tempest winds
They roll along, they sing their songs
Then blow away, but I'll stay

I'll be there in the morning
When you wake up, I'll be by your side
I'll be there in the evening
With your soul in mine
I'll be there in the morning
From the moment you begin to rise
I'll be there in the evening
Keep you satisfied, satisfied

One by one, they'll all be gone
But every day and in every way and for always, I'll stay

In each celestial waterfall
It's a song that can't be sung
But can be heard by one and all
With that sweet romantic melodies
Descended from the sky

And the world is growing dim
Take yourself and your lover and go on in

Waiting for the walking light
And I remember staring through
The crowd you disappeared into
I remember the emptiness that I felt
When you were gone

And wanting you desperately
But never having you
It keeps me awake in the night
Wishing that you were beside me
Wanting you desperately
But never telling you
It's breaking my heart
And it's tearing me apart

A new place
That was right above your room
And the happiness I felt
When I found I was close to you
And I remember the afternoon
My elevator, it opened to you
Oh what a feeling I had inside
When you turned and said ""hello""

I'd get you alone

A casual walk through the park in the winter
All that I wanted was someone I could talk to
It had to be you.

The wind was cold we huddled together
Looking back I should have known better
Wasn't it me who said I'll never fall for anyone
And look what I've done.

Gone too far, I don't know how I did it
Gone too far and I hate to admit it
But I spend all my time thinking of you
Gone too far, there's nothing I can do now
Gone too far, it'll work out somehow
But I spend all my time thinking of you

Seems before, I didn't know what was missing
Maybe I did, but I just wouldn't listen
Wasn't it me who said I'll never fall for anyone
And look What I've done.

Gone too far, I don't know how I did it
Gone too far and I hate to admit it

Hopin' you will be there
But instead I find someone
Who believe in me when I said

Do you still seek the mysteries of life?
Or have you become some businessman's wife?
And do you still long to be free?

When you stare up at the stars out in the night
Do you still think this old world could turn out right?
And do you ever think of me?

We sat for some time on the stairs
And I'd give anything that we could share

And strangers who offer their souls
But they all seem so hollow and cold

Hoe cronies I don't know what the fuck y'all on 
So long, a brother gone 
Learn it in quote 
I want a sista man, my beat Jamaicans rock on flows 
Laugh now, you know The Score 
Before I killed The Carnival 
Don't stop 
You knew me before the solo record dropped 
What?! I'm into passing on 
Movin' slow, inter - national 
Since I fork through the dough 
Called my first girl a hoe, 'cause I sweat her 
Now I know better, to let it flow, like I never met her 
And let the show tour broads quick to fuck a man, in the spotlight 
That's why I maintain the upperhand 
Damn! You know the half 
Shit is straight, 'til I turn it 
Who fresh? You gonna blow it? Only if you know it!

[Forte - 2nd Verse] 
Well it ain't nothing but a word 
The noise I heard, could make a crew want to shoot up every party and slide 
Like I'm supposed to show you love to try to get inside 
Club promoters 'fessin' with their little guest lists 
Sleek, I'm twenty deep 
All brothers in fact, now the line start with me, and it ends in the back 
You don't love me, I know you like the record!!! Don't touch me!!! 
Niggas stay wack, like crack, in the dutchee 
So why try me? 
Swift, I sure do be 
You get touched more than frisked by club security 
Lovely, what it look like? 
My sons run stuff 
Every time I touch a mic you want to, ""Throw Guns Up!"" 
Hard to follow 
Here to swipe the next man's dollar 
Crimes, white collar 
Underground, like Kabala 
You know the effort, all you do is make a record 
You silly, like Milli's, we spray the milliseconds! What?!

Speak on this wild shit, as If I could begin to 

Who fall quick? Too many niggas fightin' over small shit 

You'll find me flippin' stocks, on boats that never dock 

I travel blocks, pick the best man 

Bust shots at the yes man, 'cause it was destined

Bag a lie, in the basement of the Best Western

With the money we've got 

In Ninety Nine, more war, more crime 

Some'll stay behind doors, and some blow nines 

Your conception is annoying 

Leave the things we was born in 

The street nights, and hope we see the following morning 

Niggas sold soul, for gold ropes 

Do crimes, for new shines 

Poor beer out on the spot, where police drew lines 

Hey yo word, we thirty plus 

Wear guns that's dirty (?) bust (?) 

Ask your men pa, you should've been more (What?)...courteous 

Like my rain drop 

And all my li'l niggas rockin' tank tops 

And sell arms, like government bonds, in Bangkok 

Bank stops on lavish trips 

Soils I marry with, a dime piece!

Pikasoe meets Baracus! 

[Verse 1: 20 Grand Pikasoe] 
This world is messed up 
So I lay back, and smoke a yeshca (?) 
Till it burn my chest up, I'm stressed up 
From my toes, to my neck up 
It's all out, I seen niggas cook up 
In a small house, with the dogs out 
I know all about it, drugs, money, sex, even where the whores are routed 
Nothings too small to doubt it 
The wolves feed upon us, so we walk the streets with honor 
Looking for heat that launches six shots and eat you harder 

[Baracus] 
We want acres of land, so we can plant our own weed crops 
52 states, we want green gaze and tree spots 
We want the better life, the mo' better cheddar life 
I was a young thug when my momma threw me out 
Starvin' on the streets, the gods putting food in my mouth 
Taught me how to read and count 
Cook up coke, cut up dope and how to bag an ounce 
Me and my family coming to rob America blind, thugging since '89! 

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Forte'] 
Yours truly, El Capitan
I don't small talk, y'all all walk 
We turn half them cats up into dodgers, like the ballpark 
Five-O drop charges, 
apply pressure the hardest, more than Japanese massages 
You need us, to roll mo' 
Cruise to homogenus 
You didn't list where you from, we Madinas 
You niggas speak on dough with no conception of what green is 
Momma Sheena's how homes get bought, vis-a-vis the Dow Jones 
y'all rappers stuck on cow clones, like two tones 
We'll never match boss, at the cost, I'll fuck around and rip the patch off! 
My bitch's god-sent, my yacht-men, bigup to cassette 
At every soundset, I iron butts off, leaving the ground wet 
y'all walking like you safe, you ain't out of town yet! 
It's for the inner-city block sitters, the glock spitters 
Niggas who used to pop - locks, and cops that want to rock wit' us 
You want to hear this like you dumb guys? 
Yo, hi! Most niggas is students to this, we alumni's!

Do dirt, pull it over my face so you don't notice me 
Black Jesus, rockin' black cheeses 
Nikki Bonadon, grown scorpion 
Travel on, trying to go platinum, in Brook-lawn! 
Shook ones, can't hold guns, better hold your tongue 
And grab a hang of this hear, out for the C.R.E.A.M. this year 
So light your clip, filled with rose hips to smoke it!

On Madina streets, Casino Red, Casino The Dread 
Roc-A-Feds of Brook-Lawn 
Crooks run out of the dead, bloodshed 
Bloody red rags and dog tags, automags flossed by cats 
In this game, put shine up for grabs 
I'm talking showtime, Madenic rhyme, high-crime rates escalate 
So play for high stakes, chasin' money and guns it must be my fate 
So keep the ones where they're safe!

Throw a drop, with the beast eight 
Release eight

Shit can fuckin', fuckin' blow a beast 'way

The tec flow, through the valley 
Boom and bam Hear my voice echo through the valley!

It's all about the dollar now, white powder now 

He owed us money so I watched my niggas tie him down 

The conflict is crucial, police is neutral in this battlefield 

Where the battles grill, like cattles grill for a platter mil 

I even watched little Darryl deal 

I love the ghetto, hate the ghetto 

Must've been a genius who helped make the ghetto 

So I sit back and taste the 'retto 

I got beef, how can you misplace my metal? 

It's a sob story, it's bad the way they robbed Tory 

Of course, must've been religious 

'Cause they took a small tainin' across

We be movin' on up 
To the eastside
Where I can do my bid in a phat ass crib in the sky
We be movin' on up 
To the eastside
And it looks like we gonna get some cream from the pie

I always aim at the right gate
Make you bite ate
Running jooks on the lightweight
Monopolize jeans
Brooklyn hone my genes
Baby burners get squeezed
Move up movin' apartment twenty two m
Forty fours for the coolin'
Trips puttin' two in
Shadey broads off tour suin'
Who hate us
Little Kevin double down on eleven out in Vegas
Playin' Biggie
Mo money mo jiggy
Flig me
The more stones the more izee
Toxen
Smoking pain in the range with my nigga Shockem
Rose fed keep a road straight
Broken nose red
Baller bust we the dust
If you ain't eatin' it's us
Like we might fold
Servin' niggas frontin' like it's white gold
Dying hold the lying ain't the right goal

Everybody want to be a superstar baby
I ain't get the dough to act like abandon you
I just got things to do

You say you want trendy you say you want sheik
And honey dips rubbin' on your money clip
Hangin' at your place

Actin' all new 
Look at you how ya livin'
Meanwhile your style's played out like racism
Me I'm fresh out of love it's quite tragic
When all they want to do is inspect my gadget
And change a Superman to Clark Kent
All for the sake of fake amusment
She said what do you consider fun
If you can get it get it get it

[Chorus:]

Said I been tryin' these rocky roads for so long
Still I had to hold on
I'm trying to make that dough to move on
Papa told me stay strong
Time has come to make that change

Here comes the sun there goes the rain
Take that first step to tomorrow
Hey hey

I make hits in the basement.

Eat four stars at every miz-eal.

Underneath a daylight moon

Grey eyes, brown eyes, mad nights, red skies

With such a tender step
With such a crowded heart
And I'll be someone else
I'll be the passing man
I'll be the voice in sleep
I'll be the waving hand
But something always stays
When I walk away
When I walk away
I walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Oh, walk away
Walk away
Walk away ",Walk Away,1981
John Foxx,"When I was a man and you were a woman
We practiced ourselves every day
Every night
A man with no outline
Walking in the shadows
A girl with a blurred face
Leaning in the windows
Living our lives on the tides of this city
Moving me to you
Moving me through you
Moving you to me
Moving you through me

When I was a man and you were a woman
When I was a man and you were a woman

We met in the arcades
Where the people were meeting
We danced down the avenues
While the people were sleeping
Living our lives on the tides of this city
Moving me to you
Moving me through you
Moving you to me
Moving you through me

I was a swimmer in a foggy bar
I was trying to find some sea
I was the sound of the furniture
I was a silhouette for years
She had some blossom on the tip of her tongue
She was the surface of a trade
She was a model for an echo dress
Oh she looked so gold against the grey

When I was a man and you were a woman
When I was a man and you were a woman ",When I Was a Man and You Were a Woman,1981
John Foxx,"You were there
When I was looking through
Your pictures in the night
You were there
When I fell asleep and I
Woke up in the light
And when the streets filled
And my heart stilled
And I asked someone the time
[Chorus:]
You were there
You were there
You were there
I know you were
And you were there
When I stopped to stare
By the quiet trees
And you were there
And I thought that you were
Someone else I'd seen
And when the traffic roared
And my heart soared
So that I could hardly breathe
(Chorus)
Oh you were there
When I stood and watched
From so many years ago
You must have smiled
When I was walking through
The places that you'd known
And when I'd given up
And all the letters stopped
And no trace at all remained
(Chorus)",You Were There,1981
John Foxx,"Every avenue seems uncertain
This film beam plays across your hands
Someday I know you'll change your place in here
Don't let the sunset make you sad
In these jungles
In these jungles

The walls and the streets dissolve, I see
Rooms are all overgrown, we leave
Outside the sky's so bright
We step out in the haze
Time and time again
In these jungles
In these jungles
In these jungles

Ghostly perfume, rose and hyacinth
A deep blue twilight over our heads
The vistas melt and change in film escape
Just let the sunrise make you glad

In these jungles

Fragile as any stance I know
Voice on a golden wind
I'm turning in the blaze

I'll meet you on summer streets, you'll see
Shadows and echoes made of me
Light on my hands, I know

John Foxx,"See you walking in the streets again
A quiet ocean in a suit of grey
Locations mixed and drifting
Our features dim and shifting
I stand and watch from years away

And I see you
Standing there
Standing there
Standing there
Like a miracle

The parks and bridges and the old school walls
A taste of summer in the cool of the dawn
Some bright clothes out of focus
The shops are still and closed up
I'm old enough to know they never wait

And I see you
Standing there
Standing there
Standing there
Like a miracle 
 
I'm walking through you in these crowded places
You're swimming slowly under all these faces
The sky is going out now
I'm slowly turning round now
Then someone says ""It's not too late""

And I see you
Standing there
Standing there
Standing there
Like a miracle",Like a Miracle,1983
John Foxx,"Someone who walks with you
Shines a light in everything you do
That someone
Someone you know from sleep
Seasons pass but some things never change
Like someone
Someone who's voice comes in from summer rooms
Who stands beside you when you least expect them to
That someone
Chorus:
Well I don't need to know, don't have to say
We'll go on living in the separate way
Oh, no need to tell, no need to explain
I'm so glad that it happened this way
And it's alright to walk with you
And it's okay to feel that way
And I feel that way
And a voice comes into mine
Saying things I almost recognise
That someone
Strange how moments last so long
Always with you long after they've gone
Like someone
Someone whose voice comes in from summer rooms
Who stands beside you when you least expect them to
That someone
Ah, that someone.
Ah, that someone

John Foxx,"Stand by your shadow
Now you're completed
All kinds of lights
Show me you're there
Slowly through sunsets
Somehow the air is oh so bright
Mouth on my mouth
We'll be sailing away
As someone
Shines on
Somewhere
Out there
When I'm bewildered
When all the world is running wild
Show me an island
Just for a time
Turn to me slowly
Close as the air and oh so bright
Sleep with me gently
Songs on the wind

Shines on

When she turns 'round she is someone else

Turns her face into music...
Into fog...

To be even scaring the sky away
And making me a part of this
Corner of meaningless darkness
Of course you could but I'd rather be
What I strive along for just to be
You love your country, love the strife
Relieve your cock on your beloved wife
But I'm playing a different tune
Cause I'm moving to the moon
But I'm not prepared to go against you
And fly and jump in your corruption stoop

And since while I'm around 
I've got a few things to do
So I live on the mountain rock
And move along cuz you're just
Dancing like a fish and I judge a cold

I can't imagine your wife using that to swallow.
But you see I'm gonna cum down a feminine's throat
In the surrealistic pain and wearing a coat

A Raisin in the Sun was amazing
The joint on the dresser, a gauge went off
Jumped up, fish tank, it fell and they stuck
They shot her cousin LaVon, he owed a buck
Willie was awful, pulled out the ratchet, let off two
Grits fell on his leg, Kiana ripped the cold bowl
He violent, an Island nigga with the talent
Of six killas who just came home, from straight wilding
Robbing everything in Macy's, Lacy, short haircut
With long arms, who fuck niggas, got four babies
Yvette jabber her, slapped her wig off, ran in the crib
She did the dumb shit, my nigga then clapped her

In the aisle, busting them paper towels and wiping my Wally's down

I sold him a bag of dope, his wife came and copped again

She knew I hard the murders, a smack, it killed her man though
Now I got his fucking nephew gripping his gat, you'se a bitch...
You better kill me... you know you're booty...
You pulled your toolie out on me... motherfucker!
First thought was to snatch the ratchet, said fuck it and fucking grabbed it
I ducked, he bucked twice, this nigga was fucking laughing
I wrestled him to the ground, tustle, scuffle, constantly kicked him
He wouldn't let go the joint so I fucking bit him

Cliches and throw aways

Moments that rearrange

Is called keeping hope alive

Pain and pride
Tears I’ve cried alone

Everyday
We go running on a razorblade
Sewing up the edges frayed
Waiting to arrive

While joy
Is Little Lord Fauntleroy
Sitting in his La-Z-Boy

I never knew what love would cost 'til I lost it in the end
Never claimed to soar so high that I forgot that I could fly
You never knew what never was, you'd never cry again

We took the path that seemed familiar, as if we knew which way to go
So ???? to the tourists, as if we had anything to show
Days were long and without number, like nothing bad should ever last
As long as lasting was the answer, we answered everything so fast

Some people have to cry too long

Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

Then rolls out to sea and the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side like the oncoming tide 
With one burning thought, will your arms open wide?
At last face to face, and as we kiss through an embrace 
I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms

John Gary,"If ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in summer
Seeing you in summer, I never would go
Your hair streaked with sunlight, your lips red as flame
Your face with a luster that puts gold to shame

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn
How I'd leave in autumn, I never will know
I've seen how you sparkle when fall nips the air
I know you in autumn and I must be there

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in springtime
Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so
Oh, no, not in springtime, summer, winter, or fall
No never could I leave you at all

",If Ever I Would Leave You,1967
John Gary,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1967
John Gary,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1967
John Gary,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,1967
John Gary,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,1967
John Gary,"This is all I ask, this is all I need

Beautiful girl walk a little slower when you walk by me
Lingering sunset stay a little longer with the lonely sea
Children everywhere, when you shoot at bad men, shoot at me
Take me to that strange enchanted land, grownups seldom understand

Wandering rainbows leave a bit of color for my heart to own
Stars in the sky make my wish come true before the night has flown
And let the music play as long as there's a song to sing
And I will stay younger, I will stay younger, I will stay younger than spring

",This Is All I Ask,1967
John Gary,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy

John Gary,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.

I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

From whence old Ireland came

No wonder that I love

Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow

No one ever will.

That shines in your hair,
And the brow that's all furrowed,
And wrinkled with care.
I kiss the dear fingers,
So toil-worn for me,

In the window at night,

And guided me right.

I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

John Gary,"There's a ship lies rigged and ready in the harbor
Tomorrow for old England she sails
Far away from your land of endless sunshine
To my land full of rainy skies and gales
And I shall be aboard that ship tomorrow
Though my heart is full of tears at this farewell

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing
And the taste of war I know so very well
Even now I see the foreign flag a-raising
Their guns on fire as we sail into hell
I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow
But how bitter will be this last farewell

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

Though death and darkness gather all about me
My ship be torn apart upon the seas
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
And the heaving waves that brought me once to thee
And should I return home safe again to England
I shall watch the English mist roll through the dale

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell",Time After Time,2011
John Gatrell,"Lord Elderley, Lrd Borrowmere,
Lord Sickert and Lord Camp,
With every virtue, every grace,
Ah what avails the sceptred race,
Here you see-the four of us,
And there are so many more of us
Eldest sons that must succeed.
We know how Caesar conquered Gaul
And how to whack a cricket ball;
Apart from this, our education lacks co-ordination.
Though we're young and tentative
And rather rip-representative,
Scions of a noble breed,
We are the products of those homes serene and stately
Which only lately
Seem to have run to seed!
 
The Stately Homes of England,
How beautiful they stand,
To prove the upper classes
Have still the upper hand;
Though the fact that they have to be rebuilt
And frequently mortgaged to the hilt
Is inclined to take the gilt
Off the gingerbread,
And certainly damps the fun
Of the eldest son-
But still we won't be beaten,
We'll scrimp and scrape and save,
The playing fields of Eton
Have made us frightfully brave-
And though if the Van Dycks have to go
And we pawn the Bechstein Grand,
We'll stand
By the Stately Homes of England.
 
Here you see
The pick of us,
You may be heartily sick of us,
Still with sense
We're all imbued.
Our homes command extensive views
And with assistance from the Jews
We have been able to dispose of
Rows and rows and rows of
Gainsboroughs and Lawrences,
Some sporting prints of Aunt Florence's,
Some of which were rather rude.
Although we sometimes flaunt our family conventions,
Our good intentions
Mustn't be misconstrued.
 
The Stately Homes of England
We proudly represent,
We only keep them up for
Americans to rent,
Though the pipes that supply the bathroom burst
And the lavatory makes you fear the worst,
It was used by Charles the First
Quite informally,
And later by George the Fourth
On a journey north.
The State Apartments keep their
Historical renown,
It's wiser not to sleep there
In case they tumble down'
But still if they ever catch on fire
Which, with any luck, they might
We'll fight
For the Stately Homes  of England
 
The Stately Homes of England,
Though rather in the lurch,
Provide a lot of chances
For Psychical Research-
There's the ghost of a crazy younger son
Who murdered, in thirteen fifty-one,
An extremely rowdy Nun
Who resented it,
And people who come to call
Meet her in the hall.
The baby in the guest wing,
Who crouches by the grate,
Was walled up in the west wing
In fourteen twenty-eight.
If anyone spots
The Queen of Scots
In a hand-embroidered shroud
We're proud
Of the Stately Homes of England.
 
Lord Elderley, Lord Borrowmere,
Lord Sickert and Lord Camp,
Behold us in our hours of ease,
Uncertain, coy and hard to please.
Reading in Debrett of us,
This fine Patrician quartette of us,
We can feel extremely proud,
Our ancient lineage we trace
Back to the cradle of the Race
Before those beastly Roman bowmen
Bitched our local Yeomen.
Through the new democracy
May pain the old Aristocarcy
We've not winced nor cried aloud,
Under the bludgeonings of chance what will be- will be.
Our heads will still be
Bloody but quite unbowed!
 
The Stately Homes of England
In valley, dale and glen
Produce a race of charming,
Innocuous young men.
Though our mental equipment may be slight
And we barely distinguish left from right,
We are quite prepared to fight
For our principles,
Though none of us know so far
What they really are.
Our duty to the nation,
It's only fair to state,
Lies not I pro-creation
But what we pro-create;
And so we can cry
With kindling eye
As to married like we go,
What ho!
For the Stately Homes of England!
 
The Stately Homes of England,
Although a trifle bleak,
Historically speaking,
Are more or less unique.
We've a cousin who won the Golden Fleece
And a very peculiar fowling-piece
Which was sent to Cromwell's niece,
Who detested it,
And rapidly sent it back
With a dirty crack.
A note we have from Chaucer
Contains a bawdy joke.
We also have a saucer
That Bloody Mary broke.
We've two pairs of tights
King Arthur's Knights
Had completely worn away.
Sing Hey!
For the Stately Homes of England.
 
The Stately Homes of England,
Tho' rather on the blink
Provide a lot of reasons
For what we do and think.
Tho' we freely admit we may be wrong,
Our conviction that we are right is strong
Tho' it may not be for long,
We'll hold on to it
We might as well hold the bat
Till they knock us flat
Our dignity of race may
Retire into its shell
Our Minister of Grace may
Defend us none too well
But still if a child
Becomes too wild
And we're forced to use the rod,
Thank God

John Gielgud,"Sarah 
Gus is the cat at the theatre door
His name, as I ought to have told you before
Is really Asparagus, but that's a fuss to pronounce

That we usually call him just Gus
His coat's very shabby, he's thin as a rake
And he suffers from palsy that makes his paw shake
For he was in his youth quite the smartest of cats
But no longer a terror to mice or to rats

For he isn't the cat that he was in his prime
Though his name was quite famous, he says, in his time
And whenever he joins his friends at their club
(Which takes place at the back of the neighbouring pub)

He loves to regale them, if someone else pays
With anecdotes drawn from his palmiest days
For he once was a star of the highest degree
He has acted with Irving, he's acted with Tree

And he likes to relate his success on the halls
Where the gallery once gave him seven cat calls
But his grandest creation as he loves to tell
Was Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell


Sir John 
I have played in my time every possible part
And I used to know seventy speeches by heart
I'd extemporize backchat, I knew how to gag

And I knew how to let the cat out of the bag
I knew how to act with my back and my tail
With an hour of rehearsal, I never could fail
I'd a voice that would soften the hardest of hearts

Whether I took the lead, or in character parts
I have sat by the bedside of poor little Nell
When the curfew was rung then I swung on the bell
In the pantomime season, I never fell flat

And I once understudied Dick Whittington's cat
But my grandest creation, as history will tell
was Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell

Sarah 
Then, if someone will give him a toothful of gin
He will tell how he once played a part in East Lynne
At a Shakespeare performance he once walked on pat
When some actor suggested the need for a cat

Sir John 
And I say now these kittens, they do not get trained
As we did in the days when Victoria reigned
They never get drilled in a regular troupe
And they think they are smart just to jump through a hoop

Sarah 
And he says as he scratches himself with his claws

Sir John 
Well the theatre is certainly not what is was
These modern productions are all very well
But there's nothing to equal from what I hear tell
That moment of mystery when I made history
As Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell",Gus: The Theatre Cat,1998

Promise you'll always continue

What do I care? It's ""Goodbye, care""
When my slippers are next to the ones that belong
To the one and only beautiful girl in the world

John Giuffrida,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here!  Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here!  Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear,  why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me

John Giuffrida,"Thou swell, thou witty, thou sweet, thou grand
Wouldst kiss me pretty, would hold my hand
Both thine eyes are cute too, what they do to me
Hear me holler, I choose a sweet lollapaloosa in thee

I'd feel so rich in a hut for two
Two rooms, a kitchen, I'm sure would do
Give me not a lot of just a plot of land
And thou swell, thou witty, thou grand

John Giuffrida,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

John Givez,"I think I'm the worst rapper on this entire song
You know what it is
Or, if you don't, you're about, you're about to know

I don't need a stylist
I'm only wearin' black
And my homies are wylin'
We all love Taylor Swift
I'm eatin' with pilots, they callin' me the chef
I'm saucin' it up
No directions, we made it from scratch
Fear God tee on
Shout out to Jerry Lorenzo
They callin' me ugly
I'ma still marry a ten though
And I'm killin' the friendzone
I'ma kneel in the endzone
And my ex had nothin' inside, so you know that I hopped out a window
Anti-political, only makin' songs that I like
This is anti-radio
No placements, won't make it to top five
And high five to my team, we don't respond to anybody on the sidelines
And I shoulda died
Like, I don't know, but it feels like I got nine lives 

I came in this with, like, four friends (four up)
Tube socks and Chuck Taylors on
I stayed in this and gave no cares (not one)
Now I'm moonwalkin' on every song
Area code is 7-6-0, 6-1-9, 8-5-8
Think I'm great, think y'all late
That's okay
Marty, let me come up in this party like I'm Scarface
To point the finger at the bad guy (go ahead)
At four years old I been a rabbi (gotta leave)
Let me show you how to do this (I do it)
I just need a pencil and a pad
Guy, follow me now
Couple record companies tryna call on me now
Tell 'em all to hit they knees and acknowledge the style
It came from God
Man, I got my game from God
Ain't a dollar that can move me from the reign of God
I'm in this buildin' hollerin' West!
Hold on, let me go and take a rest, I ain't yellin' at y'all (what)
I'm just tryna hit you with some evidence y'all (what)
Evidently heaven sent me excellence y'all
I just wanna be a legend
I just wanna speak to the people
I just wanna play my sounds, make my rounds
Love God, live life
Do it all legal, it's easy

Don't ask me a question
If you don't wanna hear what my answer is, I'm gonna answer it
I got no time for the drama
I got no time for the politics
I do not care about names
They don't mean nothin' to me
I didn't get in the game to make friends
And kiss up to people that don't even like me
You know what I mean!
I don't expect everybody to like what I'm doin' out here
But I am the one that's gon' look in the mirror at the end of the day
You don't want my career
I got some people that write me like, ""I wish you'd die like your momma did""
These are the comments that I gotta problem with
You should be quiet and watch what you hollerin', woo!
My fans will eat you alive
Trolls, get off of my page
My bars fly over they heads
I wrote that line on a plane, I wrote that line on a plane
You won't see me in a chain
I basically wear the same shirt everyday
Get a hole in it, go the store and I buy it again
You already know who it is, for real

Still on the coast where they throw the set
'Palas still bounce like Hammer checks
Papi gon' get 'em like Dangerfield
Orale, you don't get no respect
Labels that hit Fern and Marty up
Marty and Fern never call 'em back
""You tryna be funny?"", was all they asked
Look at the charts, who laughin' last?
Now I'm signed, need contracts
My God is major, my league minor
Throwin' numbers up, need contact
These beats remind of Scott Steiner
Andy killed it on Sway's show
So I best be workin' my one-liners
Still pray for that skyline, boy's lit the shots at those one-timers
I just wanna see hands in the air, my Lord
Never thought rappin' would keep us employed
Feelin' like Pacquiao I'm fightin' with Floyd
The family watchin'
I better go hard in the paint, that '96 Rodman
Shots out to Eric, I got 'em
Dog days in the Cali' summer
Life's hard, this beat's harder
Rest in peace out to Harold Hunter
All praise to the Holy Father
All the smoke was secondhand
Either way we'll never land
Say a prayer 'fore I come around
Blood of Jesus, please wipe me down
New York

I wake up from my bed
Look over, kiss my lil' girl in the head
'Cause everyday is Father's Day
Just like everyday is a birthday, you dig?
Third of the three little pigs
The wisest one, I build my house up with bricks
So when the storm came, we just came together in the Lord's name
Bruh, I sold drugs
Bruh, I been grimy
Lord's stackin', you can ask 'bout me
Had the OG's, they respected me
The younger boys not remember me
I was in them streets in the background
Was your ganstar's gangsta, I spit game for free
Nowadays when I recollected and I put it down, gotta pay me
When you say Hollywood, gotta say me
When it comes to these raps and these APs
Cadillacs always been a M.O
Even when the old school broke down
I'll patch 'em up, hit the skrip with 'em
It's no surprise a brother on now
When the streets get a chance to speak up
They want a brother that's gon' eat with 'em
Speak up about the same issues and run it straight
Ain't gon' play with 'em
My contents done changed up, so them twelve year olds need a young sheperd
Looked at Santino right in his eyes
He broked out laughin', he's so reckless
He know I got now, it's no pressure
But when it's his turn, let the grits burn
That Lawrence Fishburne
But it's on record how his old boy spit it like an old veteran
Fernie
Aha, I was old boy spitting like an old veteran

I'm in a lane by myself
Ain't checkin' for nobody else
Whole team lookin' monsterish
Don't really care for they acknowledgments
You can miss me with politics
They lookin' at us like some problem kids
Anti-political
I'm anti-political

I'm anti-political",The One With My Friends,2015
John Givez,"Fictitious foolies got me on a sick one
I'm still from Tha Side ready to die for the mission
Or meditate it, then I levitated
Elevated, celebrated
You should celebrate it, this is that embedded greatness
Good, good God
I'm a mad man, mathematics, statics
Stealin' the stars
I'm a bad man, bask into battle
I'm a battered mad hatter with the earth on a platter
Meek and mild 'til I get freakin' wild
It's a misconception messin' with your intellect
I reckon it'll be neck and neck
Before I let the deck eject the message
This is not a warning, this is what you wanted on the table
'Crae, let 'em know the lil' homie willin' and able
It's Givez

Vegas, get active
Flippin' your city like gentrification all in the ghetto upon a dirty mattress
Word to that sister actress
Nevada gets it crackin'
It’s hot and J got a jacket
We'll peddle back if you askin' if love's a long practice
Full metal jacket dually known as a banana clip when rappin'
That's a loaded magazine of ammunition
Plan out snippets so these magazines don't go bananas
Over loaded clips or flows floatin'
Only showin' sinkin' ships ten percent of why he's frozen
Let it go, it's hotter than sprinters in Arizona
Juxtapose 'em to a snowman in Nova Scotia
It's rap's Christopher Nolan
Picture me rollin', pistol emoji, blaow
This a misconception triple threat
Did Givens flex?
Still a Christian, yep
Don't need acknowledgement, just respect the conglomerate
Double tap it and follow it
They shocked to see us like Donald Trump up in a taqueria
Watchin' Evita, cryin' over Argentina
Or Maria dominatin' Serena
I'm tryna find a big homie for Slim Jesus
Thesis of a new hope
More hardcore than Star Wars part four rated R
Or Rosa Parks or feet kicked off the bus exitin' starboard
Light saves like a time change
Hands up and down like a sine wave
Gospel be the humble, don't sleep the beast is a mind frame

They told me that rap was stacked
Is it tracks, is it facts?
Is it trap, is it rats?
When metaphors, you ready for the medics stored inside it
Is it similes or violence?
Is it sympathy or similar
The sinner's lord's inside 'em
The problem ain’t wordplay
I get schizophrenic with sittin', straight jackin' the beat
Blood all on it, hashtag
A dracula scheme, trick or treat
It ain’t magic, I'ma vanish when I pass to the team
Thirty-two half that
Grab a 16 and let us shoot
Betty Boop wit the black top
I’m a mascot for the dreaded truth
Locks all in my head, ain’t no chain that I hang from
But He hang from where I came from, that’s death
Guess what, I ain’t done
I'm rappin'
Beneath it is Jesus reachin' for actors
Living halle', add the 'lujah with the asterisk
Correction, then bury the body under the mattress
Livin' my dream while you sleepin' in different caskets

Look, I was created to make a statement
A sentence sent us to earth on this mission
Tryna make a way for my siblings
Brothers and sisters who drinkin'
Out of them cisterns with cracks in 'em
Listen but lack hearin'
Who lookin' but lack vision
Initially made in the Lord's image, dynamic
Nothing lackin', magic couldn't make it happen
Look at us, you hear us rappin'
That ain't complaining but how can they be mad at all?
King dreamed a dream but we seen scenes that'll make us awe
Change the channel, we channel all of this energy
Pretend to be savages, we ravage our so-called enemies
That look like us
But it look like us ain't gon' make it less we shake it
We can't look back much
Turned around to give a helping hand
I'm like, man, they gon' make it, makin' baking soda boiling inside these pans
Now they're wondering, is it rap or is it Gospel?
Look all you need to know is I was dead, now I'm not though
Real recognizing real, and if they don't love me like Pac
They better respect how I'm movin' and that I'm never gon' stop
I hit my pastor on the cell, I said, I'm catching hell
Well, what you think they did to Jesus?
Only time will tell
Can't believe we rap about the faith and people like the sound
We out here workin' in the streets, you better ask around
Tell them other rappers we don't want it, they can have the crown
They have to lay it down when you hear that trumpet sound
We know who got the keys to the kingdom
When the King come, crown Him, and your king dumb if his kingdom ain't bout Him
Say it with your chest, when the bishop is the king and the knight
The queen get the rest
I'm the only pawn that's on one, back in two thousand and one
I was wishin' labels signed me, but now I own one
That ain't braggin', that's just motivation
Get your education, this industry overrated, Satan-saturated
Folk be lyin' to your face, and sayin' they glad you made it
Turn your back and you can hear 'em hatin' in they conversation
Oh, snake face with the same bait
And the same fate, fate, fate, that get your face ate, zero-eight bass
Nah, base like the base plate
How you runnin' home?
You ain’t in that zone, they don’t let it slide
You ain’t safe
Wonder how do we survive in this suicide, do or die jungle?

But I let the trigger go, fuck being a criminal
Still rolling with some shiesty, hustlin' individuals
Bend the law till it almost break
Man y'all always 10 deep, nigga y'all so fake
That's why I don't bring the homies to alot of my shows
Can't be responsible when they start to throwin' blows
Can't stop real niggas from doing what they gotta do
My homies like to trip, talk shit, and wear alot of blue
Nowadays everybody on some different shit
Got the head up out the hood, the future's unlimited

Piercing police tried to kill me, I am not dead

I survive, I am present with a purpose
If only to make you nervous
And challenge status quo, I have done my service
Ay man, ay man, ay man, ay man

Hey look, man I know, that this beat is gangster as fuck
But I'm not, and I never have been
I'm all about peace and love and unity
And this song is about my dream and how
My whole career I just wanted everyone to get along
Man I know everybody from midtown from somewhere different
We don't all get along
But if we don't get it together you all
They about take this whole shit right out from under us
So yall don't gotta fuck with them niggas over there
But don't fuck with them niggas over there

To get to the things that we cannot hold when it's over

On a silent shore
I spoke to god
The sun is down
Assemble the great pandemonium
War

One more down by the brook of Babylon
One more down in accordance with my fate
One long drift across the lake of Avalon
One more trip that I must create

And my eyes sweep a shore
That was always there
A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium

One more, just one more
Just one, just one more day
One more day by the pits of hell
Just one more when even yesterday was too late
One more thought that I have to sow
One last trick that you can't debate

War

On a silent shore
I confronted fear
I spoke to god
But he wasn't there

And the war begun
Assemble the great pandemonium

Break down
Got to break down
Break down

They'll come to you!

You're working too hard

For something you want that can't be found
When you find out you can live without it
And go along not thinkin' about it
I'll tell you something true

The bare necessities of life will come to you 

Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2001

Oh! Will you never set me free?

Are still around us

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

Were the color of silence

So dark and so close to violence

Turned upside down

Late to the bill

The way it goes
The way it stays

Squeeze you when you hold somebody tight

John Gorka,"They say that when it comes to choosing heroes
It's best to pick the ones who aren't around
If you choose among the living
You tend to have misgivings
When your hero lets you down
He might have a bad night in your town

And so I will not name my heroes
And I'll keep my distance when I can
But if time should bend or break them
I hope I won't forsake them
If by chance they need a friend
Or need to walk on ordinary ground

God knows it must be tough to be a hero
To wake up in a hero's state of mind
They say it's hard to be heroic
Much easier to blow it
When somebody's watching all the time
And you're dancing on the thin edge of a dime

They say it's hard, so hard
They say it's hard, ain't it hard

If someday I'm mistaken for a hero
I only hope it's after I am gone

Some of us are zeros

But who is who when all is said and done

Not far from the refineries
Aimed at the sky like smoking guns

A love driven through a dozen states
With your technique for keeping me awake

The day we met is still a blur
Though I remember just how nice you were
And what you wore in Central Park
And how you left before the darkness fell

This sentimental case of things
Though I'm better with each passing day
I guess you'll be the one that got away

You wear them like you wear your clothes
Except they don't come off at night They are the space you hold up to the light

And somewhere along the line
You'll turn into a friend of mine
Who knows of my unspoken cares
Amid the aftermath of love affairs

Made in stars
No we roll off

Never called it sauce

Wise men saw a sign and set out aross the sand
Songs of praise to sing, they travelled day and night
Precious gifts to bring, guided by the light
They chased a brand new star, ever towards the west
Across the mountains far, but when it came to rest
They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles
And the miracle they prized was nothing but a child

Nothing but a child could wash these tears away
Or guide a weary world into the light of day
And nothing but a child could help erase these miles
So once again we all can be children for awhile

Everyday is heard a precious little sound
And every mother kind and every father proud
Looks down in awe to find another chance allowed",Nothing But a Child,2007
John Gourley,"Please take a seat. 
Let me tell you both a tale of love and hope. 
It's a story that you may have heard before, told as mythical lore. 
But this translation is clear, unlike the embellishments that have reached your ears. 
There was a boy who shared your bones, your eager blood, your affinity for love. 
He had it all in his hands, and he watched it all turn to sand.

If this boy they speak of sincerely sits atop my family tree, 
Then I was truly meant to leave the Dark, 
Down this path set out in front of me. 
I will reunite this world's divided halves. 
Fulfill my history. 
This is more than divine decree, it's my destiny.

Digging 'round the deep, only missing out on sleep. 
Chasing 'bout my head like the wolf that found the sheep. 
Don't go digging 'round there, you be slipping bit too much.
Milling muck and mud with the mind that lost its touch. 
I been traveling 'bout in time, never stepping out for much. 
Deepest of the deep with the wolf that lost those sheep. 
Because it's more than a little but less than a bunch, 
Found their way around with the blind that lost its touch.

The choices he made that day to burn down the world he'd helped create. 
Don't be scared, kid. 
You're gifted. 
Follow this stream, and live out that prophecy. 
Watch out for the wicked ones who call themselves beloved ones. 
Beware of the medicine before you lay your head again. 
Watch out for the wicked ones who call themselves beloved ones.

So they arrived at the doctor's camp, his crude shack. 
A shanty with walls of broken glass, 
Light leaking through the shattered cracks. 
And through he was cordial, the young couple was doubtful.

If this boy they speak of sincerely sits atop my family tree, 
I was truly meant to leave the dark down this path set out in front of me.

For the longshoremen had warned them to keep a close eye on their adored ones. 
But they had journeyed for a reason, they were here for the medicine. 
To cure the infection. But nothing could prepare him for the events that would ensnare them. 
All he could do is trust what he knew. He would listen to his gut and live for his love.",Holy the Sea,2008

While I figured it out, I only looked but I never touched,
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us:
Holding hands, making plans,
And it's lucky for me, you understand.

What a girl wants, what a girl needs,
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free.
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly...
What a girl wants, what a girl needs,
Whatever keeps me in your arms.
And I'm thanking you for being there for me.

A weaker man might have walked away, but you had faith
Strong enough to move over and understand, while I got it together.
While I figured it out, they say, ""If you love something let it go.
If it comes back it's yours, and that's how you know.
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure.""
And you're ready and willing to give me more [than]....

What a girl wants, what a girl needs,
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free.
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly...
What a girl wants, what a girl needs,
Whatever keeps me in your arms.
And I'm thanking you for being there for me.

Somebody sensitive and tough;
Somebody there when the going gets rough;
Every night, he'll be giving his love
To just one girl... one girl... one.
Somebody cool but real tender too;
Somebody, baby, just like you
Can keep me hangin' around with the one who always knew.
I'm thankin' you for being there for me.

What a girl wants, what a girl needs,
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free.
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly...
What a girl wants, what a girl needs,
Whatever keeps me in your arms.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

About the way things are?
Could you have foreseen back then

When no one else was around?

As they struck you down to the ground?

What they think is patriotic
Barely passes for robotic
And not one of them could last

It has a six-inch claw which I find rather scary

Perhaps because its beak is very large in size

John Hackett,"A rainy drive, on a long straight highway
Can 'cause time to lose it's meaning
And the mind to wander far from the act of driving
Interruptions at every curve, no longer jangle against your nerves
A rainbow bridge is not far away

Now you're standing on the steps of a fountain
On a hot summer's day
Running along a tree-lined pathway
Slowing your pace until you feel
Your heart beats in rhythm to the first light of day

Now you're running down a mountain
In the cool blue shade
A waterfall where you lift your head
Colors cascade from green to red
And the fireflies that dance, when the light is fading

You drift away on the night ride
With eyes that dream as much as they see
The wind in the willows winding through the grass
The drawbridge of consciousness is lifted at last
Where are you going?",Dreaming With Open Eyes,1999
John Hagen,"Nessun dorma!

Nella tua fredda stanza

Il nome mio nessun saprà!
No, no, sulla tua bocca lo dirò
Quando la luce splenderà!
Ed il mio bacio scioglierà
Il silenzio che ti fa mia!

Il nome suo nessun saprà
E noi dovrem, ahimè! morir! morir!

Give me the steady flow of a waterfall 
Give me the spirit of living things as they return to clay 
Just give me the restless power of the wind 
Give me the comforting glow of a wood fire 
But won't you take all your atomic poison power away 

Everybody needs some power I'm told 
To shield them from the darkness and the cold 
Some may seek a way to take control when it's bought and sold

John Hall,"They didn't own a house, no crib no toys were waiting
Still they had their love for the child they were anticipating
He was born one winter night on a road between two towns
They wrapped him up so warm and tight and said
It looks like heaven's come down

There was a new star shining in the sky up above
By its light that winter night
They found peace and perfect love
If we want to find it, I know we always will
For that new star is shining for us still

He worried how to feed him on the trade that was all he knew
It was hard enough to make ends meet when they were only two
But the cold, the dark and hunger couldn't take away their joy
And she knew that they would find a way
For their precious baby boy

There was a new star shining in the sky up above

You can fly from things
Run before the wind

It will soothe your mind
Smooth away your lines
Set your clock back 
On your own time

We will find the sea
We will find our love

John Hall,"We've been together since way back when
Sometimes I never want to see you again
But I want you to know, after all these years
You're still the one I want whisperin' in my ear

You're still the one -- I want to talk to in bed
Still the one -- that turns my head
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

I looked at your face every day
But I never saw it 'til I went away
When winter came, I just wanted to go (wanted to go)
Deep in the desert, I longed for the snow

You're still the one -- that makes me laugh
Still the one -- that's my better half
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

You're still the one -- that makes me strong
Still the one -- I want to take along
We're still having fun, and you're still the one (yes you are)

Changing, our love is going gold
Even though we grow old, it grows new

You're still the one -- that I love to touch
Still the one -- and I can't get enough
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

You're still the one -- who can scratch my itch
Still the one -- and I wouldn't switch
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

You are still the one -- that makes me shout

To fill your waking hours
With a love that is real
Baby I'm still not free

For a telephone call
And some flowers
If you're dreamin' of someone

Sometimes I still can remember
The clear September night
When we first met

And through the fall
I never looked at another
Then the winter came

I'm stepping on the devil's tail
Across the stripes of a full moon's head
All through the bar's of a Cuban jail
Bloody finger's on a purple knife
Flamingo drinking from a cocktail glass
I'm on the lawn with someone else's wife
Admire the view from the top of the mast

Hey little bird , fly away home
Your house is on fire , your children alone
Hey little bird , fly away home

Yellow sheets on a Hong Kong bed
Stazybo horn and a slingerland ride
To the carnival is what she said
A couple hundred dollars makes it dark inside
Edna million in a drop dead suit
Dutch pink on a downtown train
Two dollar pistol but the gun won't shoot
I'm in the corner on the pouring rain

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets

With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks

And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on

John Handy,"I'll never smile again
Until I smile at you
I'll never laugh again
What good would it do?
For tears would fill my eyes
My heart would realize
That our romance is through

I'm so in love with you
I'll never thrill again

John Handy,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel

John Handy,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1988
John Handy,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes

John Handy,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

John Hardee,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,2001
John Hardee,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2001
John Hardee,"Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say
 
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May

John Hardee,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you are the lover I have waited for
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Round and round I go

When the deep purple falls
Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle in the night
In the mist of a memory
You wander all back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

In the still of the night
Once again I hold you tight
Tho' you're gone your love lives on when light beams
And as long as my heart will beat
Sweet lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams
