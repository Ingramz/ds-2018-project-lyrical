John Cale,"Candy says, I've come to hate my body
And all that it requires in this world

Candy says, I'd like to know completely
What all they discretely talk about

I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly
Over my shoulder
I'm gonna watch them pass me by
Maybe when I'm older

What do you think I'd see
If I could walk away from me

Candy says, I hate the quiet places
That cause the smallest taste of what will be

Candy says, I hate the big decisions
That cause endless revisions in my mind

I'm gonna watch the bluebirds fly
Over my shoulder
I'm gonna watch them pass me by

If I could walk away from me",Candy Says,2004
John Cale,"I'm waiting for my man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington, 125
Feel sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for my man

Hey, white boy, what you doin' uptown?
Hey, white boy, you chasin' our women around?
Oh pardon me sir, it's the furthest from my mind
I'm just lookin' for a dear, dear friend of mine
I'm waiting for my man

Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
PR shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for my man

Up to a Brownstone, up three flights of stairs
Everybody's pinned you, but nobody cares
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
Ah then you gotta split because you got no time to waste
I'm waiting for my man

Baby don't you holler, darlin' don't you bawl and shout
I'm feeling good, you know I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling oh so fine
Until tomorrow, but that's just some other time
I'm waiting for my man",I'm Waiting For the Man,2004

John Cale,"Empty, empty bottles
Lying side by side
Used up empty bottles
Remembering long lost wine

Keep our empty bottles
Making empty wine
Marking our intentions
Sadly out of time

And the summer make you lazy
A day at a time
And good company evades you
Passing you by

But I do love you against all odds
Though you don't know what I want
We're much poorer than that bottle
More foolish than that wine

Maybe we can make it
Though we failed before
You keep getting closer
Closer to me once more

And I'll try to entertain you
A day at a time
Try to make myself much clearer
From your wine

But I do love you against all odds
Though you don't know what I want
Seeing you and seeing me
We're much poorer than that bottle
More foolish than that wine
",Empty Bottles,2004
John Cale,"Here she comes, you better watch your step
She's going to break your heart in two, it's true
It's not hard to realize
Just look into her false colored eyes
She builds you up to just put you down, what a clown

'Cause everybody knows
(She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please
(She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease
(She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

You're put down in her book
You're number thirty seven, have a look
She's going to smile to make you frown, what a clown
Little boy, she's from the street
Before you start, you're already beat
She's going to play you for a fool, yes it's true

'Cause everybody knows
(She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please
(She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease

John Cale,"Friar hermit stumbles over
The cloudy borderline
Frozen warnings close to mine
Close to the frozen borderline
Frozen warnings close to mine
Close to the frozen borderline

Into numberless reflections
Rises a smile from your eyes into mine
Frozen warnings close to mine
Close to the frozen borderline
Frozen warnings close to mine
Close to the frozen borderline

Over railroad station tracks
Faintly flickers a modest cry
From without a thousand cycles
A thousand cycles to come
A thousand times to win
A thousand ways to run the world
In a similar reply

John Cale,"I don't know just where I'm going
But I'm gonna try for the kingdom, if I can
'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man
When I put a spike into my vein
And I tell you things aren't quite the same

When I'm rushing on my run
And I feel just like Jesus' son
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I have made big decision
I'm gonna try to nullify my life
'Cause when the blood begins to flow
When it shoots up the dropper's neck
When I'm closing in on death

You can't help me now, you guys
And all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk
You can all go take a walk
And I guess I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas
On a great big clipper ship
Going from this land here to that
In a sailor's suit and cap

Away from the big city
Where a man cannot be free
Of all the evils of this town
And of himself and those around
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know

Heroin, be the death of me
Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life
Because a mainline into my vein 
Leads to a center in my head
And then I'm better off than dead

Because when the smack begins to flow
I really don't care anymore
About all the Jim-Jims in this town
And all the politicians making crazy sounds
And everybody putting everybody else down
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds

'Cause when the smack begins to flow
And I really don't care anymore
Ah, when that heroin is in my blood
And that blood is in my head
Then thank God that I'm as good as dead
And thank your God that I'm not aware
And thank God that I just don't care
And I guess I just don't know
Oh, and I guess I just don't know",Heroin,2004
John Cale,"I'll be your mirror
Reflect what you are, in case you don't know
I'll be the wind, the rain and the sunset
The light on your door to show that you're home

When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside you're twisted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blind
Please put down your hands
'Cause I see you

I find it hard to believe you don't know
The beauty that you are
But if you don't let me be your eyes
A hand in your darkness, so you won't be afraid

When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside you're twisted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blind
Please put down your hands

John Cale,"Janitor of lunacy
Paralyze my infancy
Petrify the empty cradle
Bring hope to them and me

Janitor of tyranny
Testify my vanity
Mortalize my memory
Deceive the devil's deed

Tolerate my jealousy
Recognize the desperate need

Janitor of lunacy
Identify my destiny
Revive the living dream
Forgive their begging scream

Seal the giving of their seed
Disease the breathing grief
",Janitor of Lunacy,2004
John Cale,"Sometimes I feel so happy
Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I feel so happy
But mostly you just make me mad
Baby, you just make me mad

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Thought of you as my mountain top
Thought of you as my peak
A thought of you as everything
I've had, but couldn't keep
I've had, but couldn't keep

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Skip a life completely
Stuff it in a cup
They said, money is like us in time
It lies, but can't stand up
Down for you is up

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

It was good what we did yesterday
And I'd do it once again
The fact that you are married
Only proves you're my best friend
But it's truly, truly a sin

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

If I could make the world as pure
And strange as what I see
I'd put you in a mirror
I'd put in front of me
I'd put in front of me

John Cale,"I was talkin' to Chuck in his Genghis Khan suit
And his wizard's hat
He spoke of his movie and how he was makin' a new sound track
And then we spoke of kids on the coast
And different types of organic soap
And the way suicides don't leave notes,
Then we spoke of Loraine, always back to Lorraine

I was speakin' to Bill who was given to pills and small racing cars
He had given them up since his last crack-up had carried him too far
Then we spoke of the movies and verse
And the way an actress held her purse
And the way life at times can get worse,
Then we spoke of Loraine, always back to Lorraine

Ah, she's a wild child, and nobody can get at her
She's a wild child, oh, and nobody can get to her

Sleepin' out on the street, oh, livin' all alone
Without a house or a home and then she asked you, please,
Hey, baby, can I have some spare change
Oh, can I break your heart ?

She's a wild child, she's a wild child

I was talkin' to Betty about her auditions, how they made her ill
But life in the theater, is certainly fraught
With many spills and chills
But she'd come down after some wine
Which is what happens most of the time
Then we sat and both spoke in rhymes
Till we spoke of Loraine, ah, always back to Lorraine

I was talking to Ed who'd been reported dead by mutual friends
He thought it was funny that I had no money to spend on him
So we both shared a piece of sweet cheese
And sang of our lives and our dreams
And how things can come apart at the seams
And we talk of Lorraine, always back to Lorraine

She's a wild child, oh, and nobody can get at her
She's a wild child, oh, and nobody can get to her

Sleepin' out on the street, oh, livin' all alone
Without a house or a home and then she asked you, please,
Oh, baby, can I have some spare change
Now can I break your heart?""

She's a wild child, she's a wild child
",Wild Child,2004
John Cale,"Before we got started
Are we all alone?
Cause I'm about to get open-hearted
It's time to send you're company home and turn off you're cellphone

Baby, can't you see
I just want to get you satisfied

This is gonna be a long night (long)
A little bit longer afternoon (afternoon)
Girl, if we get this thing right 
Oh, you gonna get satisfied real soon

(Can't you see)
Baby, can't you see
(I'm just trying)
I want to get you satisfied (satisfied)

I ain't talking about nothing physical
Cause foreplay starts in the mind (in the mind)
I'm just trying to get you to think about doing things
That you've always wanted but could never find

I'm gonna seek this thing like a buried treasure
Like Columbus sailing over the sea
Until I discover, baby, the land beyond expertise and chastity

Baby, can't you see
I'm just tryin', tryin'
I'm just tryin' to get you satisfied

I'm sure you had another lover
But let me tell you baby, all tricks aside
I can get you out of you're body
Have you ever felt like you were dyin'
And felt satisfied",Satisfied,2005
John Cale,"With marianne dissard
I live out yonder where the snakes and scorpions run
Got myself a little goldmine to bank on
But one day my heart sank when I saw madame in town
I knew her love would be the death of mine

L'amour passait, l'amour obsolète
Pourquoi perdre sa vie à chercher l'or d'un coeur?
Je ne me noierai pas dans ce désert mystique
Je ferme mes comptes et je repars
Love is passé and love is obsolete
Some spend their whole lives searching for a heart of gold
I'm tired of treading water in this desert mystique
I'm cashing in my chips before I ride

Do me a favor while I'm hanging here
Take this gold and go and hide
Ne gigote pas, chéri, sur ta corde pendu
(don't twist too hard darlin' on your hangin' rope)
Don't worry I'll be free in no time

She promised me she would be there when I'd return
She didn't say she'd have a whole army there as well
She whispered, ""j'taime baby"" as she fired that gun at me
(It's getting late and I'm running out of time)
I should've stayed way out yonder
Better off with the scorpions and snakes
Every act which has no heart will be found out in the end
Guess I'm a little late this time
Cause her love would be the death of mine",The Ballad of Cable Hogue,2007
John Cale,"Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather
Whiplash girlchild in the dark
Comes in bells, your servant, don't forsake him 
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

Downy sins of streetlight fancies
Choose the costumes she shall wear
Ermine furs adorn the imperious
Severin, Severin awaits you there

I am tired, I am weary
I could sleep for a thousand years
A thousand dreams that would awake me 
Different colors made of tears

Kiss the boot of shiny, shiny leather
Shiny leather in the dark
Tongue of thongs, the belt that does await you 
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

Severin, Severin, speak so slightly
Severin, down on your bended knee
Taste the whip, in love not given lightly 
Taste the whip, now plead for me

I am tired, I am weary
I could sleep for a thousand years
A thousand dreams that would awake me 
Different colors made of tears

Please don't forsake him 
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart.",Venus in Furs,2007
John Cale,"Baby's back, dressed in black,
Silver buttons all down her back
High, low, tipsy toe,
She broke a needle and she can't sew
Walkin' the dog,
Just walkin' the dog
If you don't know how to do it,
I'll show you how to walk te dog

Asked a fellow for fifteen cents,
See the fellow he jumped the fence
Jumped so high he touched the sky,
Never got back till the fourth of July
Walkin' the dog,
Just walkin' the dog
If you don't know how to do it,
I'll show you how to walk the dog",Walking the Dog,2007
John Cale,"She makes me so unsure of myself
Standing there but never talking sense
Just a visitor you see
So much wanting to be seen
She'd open up the door and vaguely carry us away

It's the customary thing to say or do
To a disappointed proud man in his grief
And on Fridays she'd be there
And on Wednesday not at all
Just casually appearing from the clock across the hall

You're a ghost la la la
You're a ghost
I'm in the church and I've come
To claim you with my iron drum
La la la

The Continent's just fallen in disgrace
William William William Rogers put it in its place
Blood and tears from old Japan
Caravans and lots of jam and maids of honor
Singing crying singing tediously

Get to know the date and tell the time of day
As the crowds begin complaining
How the Beaujolais is raining
Down on darkened meetings on Champs Elysee",To Have and Have Not,2015
John Cameron Mitchell,"Hey ho, hello there Mary
Hey ho, hello there
And why are you in such bad temper
God is dead Dickon
This is the most forgotten place I have ever seen
With lose great branches
And dead roots and leaves all tangled off on the ground
Now did you take a real close look at anything
Mary the strongest roses will fair thrive on being neglected
If the soil is rich enough
You mean might be alive, but how can we tell?
Oh, I can tell if the thing is wick
Wick, I've heard Ben's a wick

When a thing is wick, it has a life about it
Now, maybe not a life like you and me
But somewhere there's a single streak of green inside it
Come, and let me show you what I mean

When a thing is wick, it has a light around it
Maybe not a light that you can see
But hiding down below a spark's asleep inside it
Waiting for the right time to be seen

You clear away the dead parts
So the tender buds can form
Loosen up the earth and let the roots get warm
Let the roots get warm

Come a mild day, come a warm rain
Come a snowdrop, a comin' up
Come a lily, come a lilac
Come to call, callin' all of us to come and see

When a thing is wick
And someone cares about it
And comes to work each day
Like you and me
Will it grow?
It will
Then have no doubt about it
We'll have the grandest garden ever seen

Oh, Dickon, I want it all to be wick
Would you come and look at it with me?
I'll come every day, rain or shine if you want me
All that garden needs is for us to come wake it up
Dickon, what if we save the garden, then uncle
Archie takes it back, or Colin wants it?
What a miracle that would be, gettin' a poor
Crippled boy out to see his mother's garden

You give a living thing
A little chance to grow
That's how you will know
If she is wick, she'll grow
So grow to greet the morning
Leave the ground below
When a thing is wick
It has a will to grow and grow

Come a mild day, come a warm rain
Come a snowdrop, a-comin' up
Come a lily, come a lilac
Come to call, calling all the rest to come
Calling all of us to come
Calling all the world to come

Oh, somewhere there's single streak of green below
And all through the darkest nighttime
It's waiting for the right time
When a thing is wick, it will grow",Wick,1991

Long story short!

Yeah, long story short
When I woke up from the operation I was bleeding down there
I was bleeding from a hole between my legs
It's my first day as a woman; already it's that time of the month
But two days later the wound closed up
The hole sealed and I was left
With a one-inch mound of flesh
Where my penis used to be well my vagina never was
It was a one-inch mound of flesh
With a scar running down it like a sideways grimace on an eyeless face
It was just a little bulge

It was an angry inch!

A montage!
I'm all sewn up

A random pattern with a needle and thread
The overlapping way diseases are spread to a
Tornado body with a hand grenade head
And the legs of two lovers entwined

Inside I'm hollowed out
Outside's a paper shroud
And all the rest's illusion

And all that you can lift

John Cameron Mitchell,"When the earth was still flat, and the clouds made of fire
And mountains stretched up to the sky, sometimes higher
Folks roamed the earth like big rolling kegs
They had two sets of arms, two sets of legs
They had two faces peering out of one giant head
And they could watch all around them
And they talked while they read
And they never knew nothing of love
It was before the origin of love
Origin of love

And there were three sexes then
One that looked like two men glued back to back
Called the children of the sun
And similar in shape and girth were the children of the earth
They looked like two girls rolled up in one
And the children of the moon were like a fork shoved on a spoon
They were part sun, part earth, part daughter, part son
Origin of love

Now the gods grew quite scared of our strength and defiance
And Thor said:
""I'm gonna kill them all with my hammer
Like I killed the giants.""
And Zeus said:
""No, you better let me use my lightning, like scissors
Like I cut the legs off whales
And dinosaurs into lizards.""
Then he grabbed up some bolts
And he let out a laugh, said:
""I'll split them right down to the middle
Gonna rip them right in half.""
And then storm clouds gathered above
Into great balls of fire

And the fire shot down
From the sky in bolts
Like shining blades of a knife
And it ripped right through the flesh
Of the children of the sun
And the moon, and the earth
And some Indian god
Sewed the wound up into a hole
Pulled it 'round to our belly
To remind us of the price we pay
And Osiris and the gods of the Nile
Gathered up a big storm
To blow a hurricane
To scatter us away
In a flood of wind and rain
And a sea of tidal waves
To wash us all away
And if we dont behave
They'll cut us down again
And well be hopping round on one foot
Looking through one eye

Last time I saw you
We had just split in two
You were looking at me, and I was looking at you
You had a way so familiar
But I could not recognize
'Cause you had blood on your face
And I had blood in my eyes
But I could swear by your expression
That the pain down in your soul
Was the same as the pain down in mine
That's the pain
Cuts a straight line down through the heart
We call it love
So we wrapped our arms around each other
Trying to shove ourselves back together
We were making love
It was a cold dark evening such a long time ago
When by the mighty hand of Jove
It was the sad story
How we became lonely two-legged creatures

it's something to be seen.
They swarm to wild flowers

The world was divided by a Cold War
And the Berlin wall was the most hated symbol of that divide

And now that it's gone
We don't know who we are anymore

Standing before you in the divide
Between east and west

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,

And I said, ""Let me tell you about him, son""
And I took him upon my knee

""Why, when I was a little boy about your size
And just about every Saturday night
When I could scrape up a dime for the movies
And when my Daddy said alright""

Like everybody else that could
To see a handsome man
On a big fine stallion goin' about, doin' good""

Back in the saddle again""

""Well, he could ride his horse and play his guitar
And sing all at the same time
And I was ridin' right along there beside him
On that broomstick pony of mine""

""And you know his pistol never ran out of bullets
When the bad guys had to be stopped
And somehow his bullets never drew any blood
But the bad guys dropped when he shot""

""Yeah, old Gene was an image of justice
And goodness and purity
And in the eyes of a poor, little country boy
He made the world look better to me""

Whoopi tai ai yeh, let him go on his way
Back in the saddle again""

He'd sent a thrill right up the aisle
And the endin' would always send us home
With a good victorious smile""

Well, son, go ahead and watch the show
And then ride off into the sunset with him

I can be mistaken for the smooth and silent type
My violence bites tight like it was vampire's teeth
I'm hammerin chief, opponents with beef, you're put to sleep
My radical brain, will run your terrain, I'm comin again
It's simple and plain, you're hurtin, there's no numbin the pain
Warpin your frame to convex with ill techs
Still flex, kill specs on cassette decks
Mic checks, and tight reps, collect all live bets
We'll see how bright the lights get
The illest attack, I fight with artillery jacket
Physically smacked then verbally humbled
You stumble and fumble, so I gain possession
Music moves in cycles, natural progression
Thuganomics lesson is taught when records are bought
Analyzed for lies and fillers, nowadays
Gorillas make scrilla if the market's correct
All you need is a hook, and a hand to collect
Lack cred but respect MC's before me
Don't blast the back heat but the streets, can't ignore me
Hands nice, I rock your wigpiece, leave your hard rep soft
Just like when Miami left the Big East..

I calculate between the hi-hat, the bassline

The slideback, the scene decides that, Trademarc
Designed raps through divine contact
The synapse to climb a syntax error/era, define clever
We find Trademarc's photo ID below the letters
Your rhymes are general played, minimal blank
Your eyes was blinded by the signs of federal banks
You lost your focus of function
'Member back when MC's used to spit and say (shit) that meant somethin
The mainstream remained clean
Then the corporate industry became the same dream
And I leaned back below the scene
Mappin out the future warfare schemes
To sweep through the streets lethal, to meet you
Delete too, editorial restrictions
Cause labels need candy-ass rappers so the populars can listen
Not the caste system
The last talented cats that lost they status
Real raps end up gratis tracks on mixtapes that never sell
Cause executives and marketing schemes
Designed rims, hoes and music, and bed in jail
I know the veterans can tell, I see through the image
Mainstream acts is timid
I want hard beats, basslines, and lyrics that's vivid
A voice within it, tellin me real rap is comin back and boy it's livid
I want it, I breathe it, I live it
I cornered the scene and I bring destruction
You ain't worth your weight, never mind the cost of post-production

Through the diction of reason
Rhyme forever, but born out the 7 iller {?} to beat in

Bare-knuckled men through fight pits, beat you lifeless
Never survive this, you forgot like all-timers
Two-faced rappers walk away with four shiner

It's a one-rhymer, turnin' legends to old-timers
My incisors like a viper bitin' through your one-liners
New DeadMan Inc., and we about to make you famous
Takin' over Earth and still kickin' in Uranus

Word life, I'm untouchable

You ain't advanced enough to process, potential for medical concepts
Some objects are foreign, like Loch Ness
Arts and sex are complex regardless of your finesse
Or fitness is the condition of business

Your lame vision of a underground physical image
You're underneath to undermine, your whole typical image
With the precision of percentages and the collision of sentences
Poetry beats your mics

We untouchable like righteous sluts with no crevasses
Streets unite, we rock righter with dumber beats
You cats couldn't come this hot [Incomprehensible] in the summer heat
Forget two takes, kill your birds the first time

You better stay worthy of my filler of worse rhymes
I'm better than nice, check the veterans twice
You be beside your self with fear
I'll kill you and bury you twice despite the cover of night

Trackin' ya flight like guerrilla warfare, when the grass is dense
Approaching me is a quick way to get referred to in the past tense
Dead-da, when the lights, the mic is on
The crowd is dead like intermission and you on the Titan Tron

And I think it's funny you choose

And raw beats
Creep through side streets
Loose leaf notepads
That's where rhymes leak
Punch-lines, man, don't even beg
I got knee-slapping tracks, ya'll cruisin' ya leg
You a rhyme-writer, buddy? Man, that's a joke

We got a lil' somethin' bubblin' in Beanpot over here why'know?
I got my crew right back gon' show you how it's done
Straight up, hittin' one two like Manny and Ortiz ya heard?

It's John Cena baby, and we heatin' up the Beanpot
Big up Boston, you know the whole team hot
Yo we fresh, y'all a little bit stale
And we 'bout to make it ugly just like Kevin McHale

Cena takin' over
I'm 'bout to make the scene mine
I got a tea party, baby meet me on the Green Line
Ain't too many kids that flow better than me
Roll thick like Yassir sideburns in seventy-three

Like Tom Brady and the Pats, we rollin' kids
Cross me and pay a toll like the Tobin Bridge
From the home of the curse, y'all know what I mean
We like the left field wall, we stackin' monster Green

Knock you out of the park, you land on Yawkey Way
My shit be butter, but around here we say parquet
I rent my own team, we takin' over the industry
Like The Big Dig, baby nobody can finish me

And I don't mean to brag, but it's in the bag
And we alone on top like we goin' stag
It's a dynasty, that's how I see things
In four years we countin' three rings
I'm the MVP, baby gimme that key ring
And me, Brady and Branch'll own our sweet thing

Yeah, and we ain't gon' stop
We at the Eagle, cook 'em all as they flop
And T.O. takin' on the be roll and that's the past
Beatin' everybody and the salary cap

What now? You say titan's your rep
That's like Peyton winning big games out on Gillette
We don't forget y'all, we're keepin' it grimy
Had the Steel Curtain lookin' like venetian blinds
Yeah baby, that's how it go
That's why next year, it's lookin' like 3 in a row

Yeah, uhh
It's Esoteric, tunin' in
Puttin' it down, for Boston Mass
Yo, I rep the Bean, y'all see the way it be

Steadily, poetically I'm Bill Russell in command
Peace to Dorcester, Roxbury, Mattapan
Pack a man down quick like neanderthals
Standin' tall after brawlin' up in Fanueil Hall
As a young buck moms said I disobey
All she heard was Nomah like fans in Fenway

But they sent him to the dugs, I'm like Manny when he shrugs
And it bugs me to see the women wearin' [unknown] in the club
A deadly combination like venom hit your blood
Jason Varitek with the glove, it's all love
I'm like Schilling with the red sock, when I get hot
My aim is dangerous, like the Larry Bird set shot
It's clear now, you livin' in fear now
Big up Boston, the champ is here now

His skills I respect, I expect you dolly

Some got gifts man but reflect it crudely
That's why I keep it real like rejected movies
What now and no what was or would be

We spittin heat on your block
We new to the game but runnin the spot
Numbin your knot, baselines that'll make your neck break
This rook will take your queen and put your king in check mate
Open your mind without makin ya meditate
We real champs, y'all just featherweight
Time to get it straight, I push ya wig back
Crew loaded up with extra bread like a Big Mac
Beefin with us, we're leavin your face down
Stompin bitch rappers like I'm straight outta A-Town
Runnin the play ground like it was a track meet
Shoes on the quick that be bigger than Shaq's feet
We into big things, bank accounts, overgrown
All types of cheese, swiss cheddar povalon
Guaranteed to burn wax like candles
Tracks hittin hard to the head like shots of Jack Daniels

Y'all bitch crews (crews)
Don't wanna fuck with us
Y'all bound to lose
Another one bites the dust

It's Trademarc, the truth
Laid back on loof, I'm God, as if you needed some proof
You ain't hard I can see it on you
I need a roof, fuck a drop top crop 
If I'm creepin on you
Click clack nigga rap knick knacks if you got heaters on you
Spittin back loud rounders with five pounders
If you heatin onto, I'll put a beatin on you
You sounds tired, buddy, that's why I'm sleepin on you
We lean back in the ride with cream stacks in the bar hide
That's how the guards slide with the raw vibe
Straight military camel clothes, hash brown boots, shoots
I will handle the flow
Since an animals gold tooth and brand it like (?)
You go fuck like eskimo hoes

I got pump stumps and switches
Dump stunks is bitches
We feed you to the sharks, you can sleep with the fishes
(?) but I ain't no busboy
You ain't family, you ain't earnin my trust, boy
Seen too many bitches that'll double cross ya
We bring more drama than the Laker roster
Get the clique pissed, ain't nobody could save ya
Throw heat without lookin like Fernando Valezuela

Marc Records the name, the rest of you lame 
I'm ego driven seen with different women every size and flame
I refine my game by fuckin famous bitches
But it's all the same it's just next to the miss
Sex to the brain, misses or misses
Married or not, my game don't stop
These cars bars bars and stocks, you ain't seen my flow
Y'all are small-time suckers, like a knee high hoe

Yo, yo, for the hood (for the hood)
Everybody flow easy, ha ha, so easy
Yo, listen
For the corrupt mob, John Cena, Trademarc, listen

I embarrass MC's who touch the mic with me
That's why they never holla when it's showtime - gimme
I spit poison like a black snake bit me
Guns up in the E-Class, D's can't get me
My foot is a 13, 12's don't fit me
My heart is cold and hard like Jack Frost bit me
So many new flows old flows start to panic
It's time they got built by the mic mechanic
y'all heard, I stay in hood streets like curbs
And never forget, where I come from, word
I ain't goin broke, fuck you, I'll cop me a brick
And take it straight to the block, forget rap quick
Don't trip, Bump got a speed zone sign
For suckers who move too fast against mine
I'm pressed, pushin it full speed ahead
You left, bullet in chest, meet the dead, so

[Chorus]
Flow easy, turn up the mic it's time
to flow easy, whenever I spit my rhyme
I flow easy, the underground pound and grime
Flow easy, but yours don't sound like mine
I flow easy, turn up the mic it's time
I flow easy, whenever I spit my rhyme
I flow easy, the underground pound and grime
Flow easy, so yours don't sound like mine I flow easy

[Tha Trademarc]
Philosopher first, rapper second
Manifest the message, lessons involved
It all but hits you, aviate your crew and lift you
So what's the issue? Trademarc has got it locked before he meet you
Greet your mind before we even greet you
Won't mislead you, I ain't trustin people, cause I defeat you
Take it down a notch, slow your roll
Cause we crush spirits, like we stole your soul
I set styles off dog, y'all are fuckin mimics
Man I talk more shit than pro-lifers in abortion clinics
Run my mouth off like high school rumors
Man and grab microphones like pedophiles gropin late bloomers
Flow easy like your first day with white sneakers
You just a face in the crowd like packed bleachers
Huh, you better rock a sleeveless
Freddie Foxxx, Trademarc, John Cena breeze through
y'all are fuckin divas

First and foremost I sure post potential like Carmelo
Turn a hard MC to jello
Make their skin yellow with fear while stayin mellow and clear
Man, we in for one hell of a year, yeah
Curse a fool like the Red Sox, we tighter than headlocks
I'm flowin easy with Freddie Foxxx
Known to hang it low like dreadlocks and y'all are too slow
Like wearing a weight vest and lead socks
I'm a fat kid, you feed me? I'm still hungry
Never let a bitch take a bill from me
Like Jordan in the 4th quarter, I'm still money
Best believe the flow water, we still runny
Make your stomach feel funny, I'm so sick
With 16 bars twice the value of gold brick
Make it known quick that I'm greedy, we got the rats and the cheese be	
So believe me

Now they on about shovels in the weight of the ground
What now?
Preachin' on the way that they handle thing
Watin' patiently to do the six-foot same thing
Now, so I take a second look at my life
I made too many mistakes that I just couldn't make right
Should've been more focused than I take things light
When I'm gone this is what ya'll will say I was like
American fool, no not that baddest or cool
Just a big fish caught up in the shallowish pool
Not a big name playa, in fact its true
Never wanted this shit without the kats he knew
He got lucky rode the co-tails of everyone's fame
In two weeks ain't nobody gon' rememba his name
Fuck it
I'm ready to go, I done made records
Made monetary often that flow
More importantly though, I proved everyone wrong

I want ya'll to feel the wound, its the truth in my words
I been quiet for too long, the truth should be heard
It was a while back, 10:20 in the morn'
Kat should up on my lawn in the rug-ed uniform
Unexpected, there's a knock on my door
I met this fool in the club, I don' see him before
Open to great him, but the second he sees me
His eyes buckle, his voice is uneasy
But it's cool, I didn't even catch it at first
I check his shoulder, homie's rockin a purse
Now I know something's tricky, but I'm already sittin' down
Homie pipes up, you should hear what he's spittin' out
Says I've been sleepin' wit his wifey
And he ain't the type of kat to take that shit lightly
I made a move and he told me homie wait
Reached in his purse pulled a chrome 38
He asked me if I'm ready to die
Said he was gonna pull my brains all over the sky
Said he was leavin' the country, and he was straight with the passports
Cocked the hammer, I'm thinkin' my last thoughts
I'm in a bad way, nothin could save this.
I close my eyes hopin it's painless
Just waitin' for the sound, ready to swallow too
But homie havin trouble with his follow through
By a miracle, I avoid the chalk ground
Homie's confused, he just wanna be talked down
His wife is sleepin' through town and he knew it
Picked me outta the crowd but couldn't do it
Just lost it, and as he's walkin' away
I realize life is short so I'm markin the day
Now it's full speed ahead, I'll rest when I'm dead
And I could give a fuck what the next man said
I live how I wanna live
Buy what I wanna buy
Do what I wanna do
Try what I wanna try
Fear nothin', take chances
Not afraid to fail, always makin' advances
So when I ride on the grim reaper highway
No regrets bitch, I did it my way
Yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

This is just another day in the life
This is just another day... in my life

Is this really life? Do you really fight?
Do you fear the mic, when there's millions watchin'?
Are you super rich now, how much grip you coppin'?
You the new kid, now you gettin' some shine
When every vet sayin' that it's not yo' time
My hustle is non-stop and it's not yo' grind
Plus I hear very clear, I'm not so blind
Beef I don't sweat it, sleep I don't get it
I remember your face it's just your name I forget it
These days they melt together as one
I got some plans to do shit that ain't never been done
Take this game into battles that ain't never been won
I ain't gon' walk through life, I think it's better to run
And yeah I'm eatin' right if you askin'

No heat, no food, no money, no girls
And if life's my oyster then I ain't found pearls
Makin' moves every day so the ends could meet
No gas money, so I use my legs and feet
Everybody I meet man, they likely saw
That I be in the same clothes from the night before
Shoes so old you can call 'em retros
Man I'm so damn broke, even my wallet echoes
I got a dollar and change; man, I'm under the gun
That buck's the only thing keepin' me from bein' a bum
That's why I'm writin' these words man, so I can get on
So I can realize bein' poor was makin' me strong
And the only reason I can't rub pennies together
Is cause I carry big bills, in genuine leather

Shakin' hands with some fans by the thousands
My place so poor, looks like public housin'
Gettin' the Porsche when I shoulda got the CL6
My ride broke down, I'ma kinda between whips
Face on the Xbox, you played the game lately?
Man I can't rent, I owe too much in late fees
Do I, charter a jet, or fly first class?
Do I take a cab? Bus seats hurt my ass
Pay my jeweler in cash, he don't take a check
The chain I rock, leaves a green mark on my neck
Do I get the fillet steak or the shrimp and crab mix?
Do I get a number three or a number six?
Get in the club V.I.P. man they lettin' me slide

I did it with hot rhymes and a lung full of flame
I never refrain, from loadin up and takin aim
Like chicks flows are different, I never cum/come the same
My mic will be the dame, written or off the brain
I show up with my chest pumpin hard like Notre Dame
I lose then I regain, hustle is in the vein
I'm drinkin protein shakes to muscle up the brain
In the black Chevy Suburban sippin champagne
with champagne, dick out doin the damn thang
We movin in the fast lane, with them black thangs
On the way to the Bronx, to do the ski-mask thang
I don't know what's so funny cause I ain't laughing
The part is for a dead body, guess who's casting

See how I can rip it
And be, effective

Your whole crew gettin dumped dumped dumped with the chumps
We rollin like Donald Trump Trump Trump with the bucks
Your bitch-ass gettin jump jump jumped cause you suck
Follow me, you stick around round round when it's hot
You claimin that you down down down but you not
You try to offer me a pound pound pound you get got
I can't wait to hear the sound sound sound of you shot
You hearin me, it's time to show show show I got plans
That's all you brought you bettter go go go get your mans
A legal hustle, ain't no no fuckin with grams
Stash the heat cause I can throw throw throw with my hands
I'm tellin you, on screen screen screen with these flicks
Catch me on the scene scene scene with three chicks
I fuck like a fiend fiend fiend with three dicks
Fuck a sixteen teen teen I'm just sick

My camou' colors dog they be beige and brown
That shit was all love 'til you cowards came around
With the same ol' sound that's why your payroll down
That's how the game go now that's why you ain't gain ground
Cause you stuck on then dog, you ain't on now
And that's how it's been baby cause you ain't know how
You move your pen lazy maybe or your beats don't pound
I move quicker than the word on the street go 'round
I write down every lesson that my peeps hold down
You let your heat go blaow if you ain't speak profound
I write sixteens down 'til I hit green now
Makin up slang, ain't know what shit mean now
Trademarc, Marc Predka, jot the real name down
You can catch it on every marquee in town
Sayin Trademarc, ain't nobody like you now
Probably sweatin this track dog, go wipe your brow

And kill for the right price I got a buckin' name
My forty caliber too fresh, stuck in aim
We roll like 18 wheelers in the truckin' game
I'm nice with mics there's nothin' more I like
Than to paralyze your left side and leave you all right
I be layin front of your crib with Tec-why all night
Tryin to get them 9 millimeters loaded up tight, listen
I'm like a Cadillac, I write a battle rap
So smooth contest you'll be out of that
Y'all know the beef is stewin, that Bumpy came to ruin
You may be signed but you don't know what the fuck you doin

And send you higher than a long Colt four-four

And slam a fool on his back and break the whole floor

We keep on, once the cops are gone

I make sure you and your mans done
When I see y'all both drop, I'm the cat screamin' And 1
You see me on the team dog you know the game's over
Stones on my wrist, and a chip on my shoulder
Sixteens cashin' in on another hot beat
Go cop me a drop with the butterscotch seats
And we better not meet, if we do you gon' see a change
Make sure you whole FACE gettin rearranged
We rollin' up in the blacked out truck dog
It's Freddie Foxxx, now you deal with Corrupt Mob
It's gas on the fire, any time a track blaze
Squad known to beef up the Heat, just like the Shaq trade

This my 9 to 5, this ain't no hobby cat
Copycat killers bite styles, my rhyme piles is heavy
Give me a beat, man I'll body that
Spittin' that heat street raps man they nod to that
What you smilin' at? You R&B, man that's hardly rap
You lost the beat, man you bought a map
Matter fact, here's my next rap, borrow that
Been off the street too long, I want my corner back
You ain't a player, you a armchair quarterback
You ride the beat like side streets on a flat
Don't play dumb, I know where you came from
You only seen slugs buddy after the rain come
Keep it subtle, Trademarc got you bitch
Like babies suckin' tits talkin 'bout mami let's cuddle
It's gon' be what it's gon' be, you duck down
A quiet cat with a violent rap, what now?

Yo we tear up any crew, leave a motherfucker worn

Just clap with me like the lightning do, yeah
A bit of soul food that you be bitin into
And if you feel me then I'm writin for you, uh-huh
Right now put another coat of wax on the ride
For a minute put the beef and the gats to the side
Cause this track's got a vibe to chill to
Enjoy life for 5 minutes, man it's not gon' kill you
It's okay to be hard and stay true man
But at the end of the day, we all hu-man
This one's for you, the ones that you close to
Show some love, it's what you supposed to
Right now, forget the ends and the Benz
Pop a cold one, man toast it wit'cha real friends
Call your folks, tell 'em you tight now
Cause everything lookin pretty good right now


Right now baby, we all gon' ride
So place those things on your hips or side
The soul vibe gon' change, give way with fame
But sometimes the moral change or stay the same
Relax baby, right now you here
And sit back baby, with a round of beer
And cheer to those friends who crowded near
For those passed on in spirit they there
It's gon' be what it must, break bread wit'cha crew
If you got kids take the crust
It's all love baby, tell your girl she's strong
And whisper in her ear after dinner it's on
And take it slow baby, cause everything real
When you at family dinner y'all enjoy that meal
Thank God that you healthy and you keepin it tight
And keep your dreams lighthearted when you sleepin at night


Yeah - and right now I'm showin love to my brothers and my old man
To my girl, ""Let's Get it On"" like the slow jam
To everybody that I'm runnin down the road with
y'all my family, I know that you know this
Fox, Rock, be	's and Chaos
y'all growin up with me man, true to life players
Grandma or grandpa watchin up above
Trademarc you my heart cousin, nothin but love

Thanks momma, for all that you was
You a strongarm lady baby crazy with love
My sister raised me, those are the facts
And taught me how to rebuild when the order collapsed
And right now I'm blessed no stress no less
And thanks hip-hop for givin me back focus, huh

Get your throat cut when you step in the dojo
y'all got no flow, we be makin hits
You like a proctologist, you feelin my shit
Yeah - you all hype like a street team
I spend more time holdin a mic than Mean Gene
Makin beat fiends scream, they be lovin the click
Roll solo to the party but I leave with ya chick
Cause she know that when I'm flowin it's hot
There's a party in my pants, she be blowin the spot
Buck naked in the old school drop, givin me skull again
She give me free strokes, that's why I call her a mulligan
See me on TV, knows everything about me
You can't fuck with me, she can't fuck without me
And if you think she don't be lovin my thangs
That's like sayin you eat at Hooters for the buffalo wings, what?

Fuck record execs, promisin checks
I been cleanin tables now I'm seein labels, these chicks
sayin ""haven't we met,"" man holdin my breath
Feel like the lesser of two evils that I haven't seen yet
I got girls runnin game with a pimp strut
Big butt booty bitches tryin to link up
They walkin toward me, conversation and they body bore me
I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story
Nas said it before, that's raw
If you leavin the club your clothes'll end up on the car floor
Man, I got no time for words after sex
I just kick you to the curb and be laughin next
Cause Trademarc is a clingy chick's nightmare
Even though you took me home, I won't spend the night there
I've had hookers to virgins, on they back
Wild sex all the way to dead lays like necrophiliacs

Johnny Cena got the girls, girls but I'm not Jay-Z
I play the field, I never let the field play me

Plus the whip got more switches than the mixer board
I'm stickin your whore, while you flossin your Range
Gave her a dollar, she gave me back a buck and some change
She tried to swallow me whole, I brushed the back of her wig

Yeah we doin things now man
It's just another day in the life why'know
Always tryin to do some big bid'ness
Sometimes when we havin fun
Some shit goes down why'know, you ain't expectin nothin
Then, somethin come out of nothin

It was just another typical day in the summer
Me, Trademarc, Crouch and my little brother
We put the whips out, we cruise up to the strip man
Three wheel motion killin fools like a hit man
We on some chill shit, vibin out
But we still in the mix, fuck hidin out
On the corner of L Street, I locked eyes with her
I ain't steppin man this bitch had guys with her
She came through the crowd and walked over to me
Catchin P off guard, she actin like she knew me
Her name was Shannon, she was canon
She's hangin with Melissa, this big booty chick you couldn't miss her
This chick was like a fitted cap, all over my dome
Said she want to be down, but I ain't takin her home
That's when she said she live right down the street
She love white chocolate, well I got somethin sweet

[Chorus 2X: female singer]
Saw you walkin down the street and I
heard you say you had somethin sweet for me
Lover.. (somethin sweet) lover.. somethin sweet

[Tha Trademarc]
We run game, fill the blanks in, what's your hon's name
I can take an Eva hot bitch like bum change
Playin hard to get when I step, I'm afraid
I can treat a chick like cheap gas and upgrade
Whatever you need, whatever you want
With Trademarc on your arm, girl what more could you flaunt
There's just something about us, summer fling got you wondering
where I'll be in spring, but that's another thing
I'll be out girl, quicker than tans
If you want somethin stick hurr, stick wit'cha man
I ain't lookin for a lover girl, I'm lookin for sex
I can tell you I got money or I'm pushin a Lex
Whatever gets you hot, that's what I say next
Gettin passed through the crew girl that's a safe bet
I think it's funny how it doesn't take a whole lot
Trademarc's like an open flame, getting girls hot

Yo... with these sweet flows, the streets knows
whether we pimped out in streets clothes, we the bomb like deep throws
My speech grows to reach hoes - all over the globe
I got class like a Ric Flair robe

Man I'm in and out quick like Jordan in the zone
D takin out a bitch like a pass from Shaq to Kobe
You know me with a extra set of hands
a bitch couldn't hold me man I leave 'em lonely

[John Cena]
If I catch a glimpse of your chick when she smile and fine
I make sure she lose your number, she'd be dialin mine
I ain't about a wife even if she won this right
I'll fuck for seven days but stand for one night

Fuck a day off, I'm movin heavy for the payoff

Foot to the floor and you ain't you keep the pace
Throw me a whore and call me Kobe cause you know that I'ma beat the case
I buy some land, and never even see the place

Hold five, everything live
And I vibe, ain't nobody thought this day would arrive
But I balance my talents with a hope and a drive
And ride beats dog, that's where my focus derive

I ain't stoppin 'til I own the field that y'all play on
Desperado - eyes like a bird of prey
Cold soldier - crack snap your vertebrae
No heater - flow sweeter than Cohiba
Cinnamon dip, spice ride in the cinnamon whip
Quite wide on the benjamin clip
Might slide but we ain't gonna slip - no way
If the meek shall inherit the earth, guess what?
y'all get the globe if they measure in, lyrical worth
Trademarc flow first, make the mental work
Fuck a verse - I rearrange your dental work
And when it pop off, we not soft
We like the Bentleys; y'all just the Chrysler knockoffs

[Chorus]

[Tha Trademarc]
But that's life, yeah you hearin me right
It's like I had to find the black of night
come back to life with master insight that shine bright - I'm always learnin
My burden, to blow up gifts like this, I must endure the slow burnin
It's sort of strange, my philosophy's changed
I take chances, jump before the water's in range
And never wait for safe answers so if all that remains
is lookin back at my life it never seems like I wasted glances
Man it's all a big game, that's why it doesn't mean a thing
That I get money and fame, it's all the same
if you call me Trademarc or if you know my real name
Marc Predka ain't attached to ego
He's a hero for the average people, a blessing
Who transcends the essence of a poet with a street flow
It's not lip service I don't speak to hear myself talk
And I don't want to be a teacher; I'm grateful for all I've been taught

[Freddie Foxxx a.k.a. Bumpy Knuckles]
Hahahaha...
Y'all know the rep, yeah, listen

My name is Bumpy Knuckles, I write that fuckin flame
And kill for the right price I got a buckin name
My forty caliber too fresh, stuck in aim
We roll like 18 wheelers in the truckin game
I'm nice with mics there's nothin more I like
Than to paralyze your left side and leave you all right
I be layin front of your crib with Tec-why all night
Tryin to get them 9 millimeters loaded up tight, listen
I'm like a Cadillac, I write a battle rap
So smooth contest you'll be out of that
Y'all know the beef is stewin, that Bumpy came to ruin
You may be signed but you don't know what the fuck you doin
I make aight hot, I make dope raw
And send you higher than a long Colt four-four
You know the only rap pimp that kept a ho poor
And slam a fool on his back and break the whole floor

[Chorus: Bumpy Knuckles]
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
We keep on, once the cops are gone
This is real street spit you best be warned
Tell your favorite MC the mic is on
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
We keep on, once the cops are gone

[John Cena]
Yeah, yeah
It's the J daddy, not Hov' or Jam Master
My mic is correct, but y'all know the hands faster
See you bitch rappers I'm attackin the pile
Y'all be cryin foul cause I'm hackin your style
I make sure you and your mans done
When I see y'all both drop, I'm the cat screamin And1
You see me on the team dog you know the game's over
Stones on my wrist, and a chip on my shoulder
Sixteens cashin in on another hot beat
Go cop me a drop with the butterscotch seats
And we better not meet, if we do you gon' see a change
Make sure you whole FACE gettin rearranged
We rollin up in the blacked out truck dog
It's Freddie Foxxx, now you deal with Corrupt Mob
It's gas on the fire, any time a track blaze
Squad known to beef up the Heat, just like the Shaq trade

[Tha Trademarc]
This my 9 to 5, this ain't no hobby cat
Copycat killers bite styles, my rhyme piles is heavy
Give me a beat, man I'll body that
Spittin that heat street raps man they nod to that
What you smilin at? You R&B, man that's hardly rap
You lost the beat, man you bought a map
Matter fact, here's my next rap, borrow that
Been off the street too long, I want my corner back
You ain't a player, you a armchair quarterback
You ride the beat like side streets on a flat
Don't play dumb, I know where you came from
You only seen slugs buddy after the rain come
Keep it subtle, Trademarc got you bitch
Like babies suckin tits talkin 'bout mami let's cuddle
It's gon' be what it's gon' be, you duck down
A quiet cat with a violent rap, what now?

You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl

In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

John Cephas,"Oh come all you young fellers so young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home 
And pity the miner digging my bones
Where it's dark as a dungeon",Dark as a Dungeon,2000

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

John Chilton,"Sweet young thing of sixteen
Thought I'd step out one night
I longed to get the thrilling life I've missed
I met a youth 
A bit uncouth
Although he seemed alright
I knew him by the moment when we kissed

Then I got home, next day with a swollen head
My girlfriend asked if I'd had fun I said,
""Was I drunk?
Was he handsome?
Did momma give me hell?
Did I get a thrill?
Am I full of quiver?
Was he rough?
Did I care?
Am I glad I fell?
Every time I think of him do I shiver?
Was he hot?
And was I?
And would he stand for maybe?
He would not?
Did I lie?
Does he still think I'm a baby?
If I was, am I still?
Do I care?
Don't be silly
Was I drunk?
Was he handsome?
And did momma give me hell?

Was I drunk?
Was he handsome?
Did momma give me hell?
With his hands loose as no refusin'
Did he fight?
Was I blue?
Almost shamed to tell
And I don't know yet the system he was usin'

Well I said, stop, please, behave!
Well what's the use of breathin'?
He said, give
So I gave
After all, what was I savin'?
Am I glad?
Holy gee, 
Have I had fun, you're askin' me?
Was I drunk?
Was he handsome?
And did momma give me hell?""",Was I Drunk?,2002

John Chisson,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1997

Competition start swearin ya, goldiggers setting you up

Soon be forgetting your existence
Do ya need a for instance?
I hafta admit admire your persistence in stickin to a game plan
That brings ya pain man
And at the end of the day nothin is gained

Listen to the voice within. I'll see ya later
Pay heed to the grand oral disseminator..

John Clayton,"When you just give love
And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm so in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you

John Clayton,"Je vous parle d'un temps
Que les moins de vingt ans
Ne peuvent pas connaître
Montmartre en ce temps-là
Accrochait ses lilas
Jusque sous nos fenêtres
Et si l'humble garni
Qui nous servait de nid
Ne payait pas de mine
C'est là qu'on s'est connu
Moi qui criait famine
Et toi qui posais nue

La bohème, la bohème
Ça voulait dire, On est heureux
La bohème, la bohème
Nous ne mangions qu'un jour sur deux

Dans les cafés voisins
Nous étions quelques-uns
Qui attendions la gloire
Et bien que miséreux
Avec le ventre creux
Nous ne cessions d'y croire
Et quand quelque bistro
Contre un bon repas chaud
Nous prenait une toile
Nous récitions des vers
Groupés autour do poêle
En oubliant l'hiver

La bohème, la bohème
Ça voulait dire : Tu es jolie
La bohème, la bohème
Et nous avions tous do génie

Souvent il m'arrivait
Devant mon chevalet
De passer des nuits blanches
Retouchant le dessin
De la ligne d'un sein
do galbe d'une hanche
Et ce n'est qu'au matin
Qu'on s'asseyait enfin
Devant un café-crème
Épuisés mais ravis
Fallait-il que l'on s'aime
Et qu'on aime la vie

La bohème, la bohème
Ça voulait dire, on a vingt ans
La bohème, la bohème
Et nous vivions de l'air do temps

Quand au hasard des jours
Je m'en vais faire un tour
À mon ancienne adresse
Je ne reconnais plus
Ni les murs, ni les rues
Qui ont vu ma jeunesse
En haut d'un escalier
Je cherche l'atelier
Dont plus rien ne subsiste
Dans son nouveau décor
Montmartre semble triste
Et les lilas sont morts

La bohème, la bohème
On était jeunes, on était fous
La bohème, la bohème
Ça ne veut plus rien dire do tout",La  Bohème,2009

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Over the shadows and the rain

Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

John Colianni,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1995
John Colianni,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",Christmas Song,1998
John Colianni,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

John Coltrane,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams

Paradise to live

Know why I've been blue

Why should we spend money
On a show or two

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

When he's near I'm fair and warmer
When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers;in emotion

When a woman loves a man like I love him
Never treats me sweet and gentle the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good!
My poor heart is sentimental not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls aroun'
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out
He don't love me like I love him nobody could

Like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood

And the things I tell my pillow no woman should
I got it bad and that ain't good!

Melodies the sweetest music ever played.
Autumn kisses we knew are beautiful souvenirs.
As I pause to recall the leaves seem to fall like tears.

I viewed a mighty light approching in a zoom
Need was there to tell someone of my discovery
Fifteen seconds later, a light appeared in front of me
To my surprise, there stood a man with age and mystery
His name was Jupiter and came to visit me

The name is Jupiter, from the galaxy
I came to meet you, to make you free
Deliver to you a flower from
A distant planet, from where I come

Keep your eye on Jupiter, such beauty in the sky
We will wait for your return in the by and by
Keep your eye on Jupiter, memories we shall fulfill
Just to view a brighter day, and do a righteous will

The flower fragrance help reveal to me the sign
The sigh of love, I had confessed to live and really know
The sign of love which I had failed my fellowman to show

And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

This vigil burns until the day our fires overtake you.
Our father we forsake you.

Blessed be his name
Nothing now the same.

Ask me why I hate
Why I've prayed to see the nation that I loved disintegrate
And gladly give my life

In generations before your blood stained glory
I reject you
I deny you
I defy you to continue.

John Coltrane,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life from jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distinguish traces that used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day, twelve O'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong, again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again and only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again a trough full of hearts
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you, I will while yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too

Romance is mush stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too

John Coltrane,"The night is getting on
The band is getting slow
The crowd is almost gone
But here we are still dancing

Nothing to do, but waltz

Our feet can barely move
My legs are yelling ""Whoa""
But we're in such a groove
And love is still advancing

Nothing to do, but waltz

You can't suggest that we could go on jitterbugging
No bugging

We've nothing left for moves more strenuous than hugging
Just hugging

But we don't need much room to gently cut-a-rug in, we two

We're dead on our feet
And the sauce is repeatin'
But what can you do?

I tried another juice
And get from head to toe
My body's feeling loose
And warm and kind of supple

Nothing to do, but waltz

My man would slip away
My arms just won't let go
I think I'd like to stay,
Till we're the only couple

Nothing to do, but waltz

You never know how far this sort of thing can get you
One never knows, one never, never knows

We're not as tired as we would like to think, I bet you
You stay up half the night with me, if I would let you
Yes

Memories always start 'round midnight

When my heart is still with you,
And ol' midnight knows it, too.
When a quarrel we had needs mending,
Does it mean that our love is ending.

You're out of my heart,
And I'm out of my mind.

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

John Coltrane,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1997

Half a love, never appealed to me

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow

John Coltrane,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

John Coltrane,"Abide with me, fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, oh abide with me

I need Thy presence every passing hour
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine Lord abide with me

Hold thou Thy cross before my closing eyes
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies
Heaven's morning breaks and earth's vain shadows flee
In life, in death oh Lord abide with me

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

John Coltrane,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life from jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distinguish traces that used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day, twelve O'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong, again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again and only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again a trough full of hearts
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you, I will while yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too

John Coltrane Quartet,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life from jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distinguish traces that used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day, twelve O'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong, again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again and only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again a trough full of hearts
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you, I will while yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too

Romance is mush stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too

John Coltrane Quartet,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring
And you appear in all your splendor
My one and only love

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms
I feel your lips, so warm and tender
My one and only love

The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender

Never go away

Haunting and taunting
You're just kind of wild

Can't seem to shake off

she's only human and she cries sometimes when she looks in the mirror
And counts a new line that seems to appeared overnight
she's only human it's not that she's vain she's just afraid
That there'll come a time when I'll turn away at the sight but I swear that's not right
And in my eyes she just grows lovelier to me
In my eyes she's only aging gracefully
And a thousand strands of gray just won't disguise
The woman she'll always be in my eyes
Sometimes she makes mistakes but I'm aware of her faults
Her moods go up and down but that's just because
she's just a woman and giving her love only to me
Without her health I would be less of a man than she thinks I am

Then a short five years later it all comes undone
She's gone back to mama with the boy by her side
Now I'm wine drunk and running with them on my mind

I'm on the backside of thirty and back on my own
An empty apartment don't feel like a home
On the backside of thirty, the short side of time
Back on the bottom with no will to climb

It's dawn Monday morning and I just called in sick
I skipped work last Friday to drink this much red
And when my friends ask me, Lord, I'll tell them I'm fine
But my eyes tell a story that my lies can't hide

Pretended we'd make it, does she have the kid?
And he made life better for two years or more
But now weekends between us, will be his reward

Maybe by leaving would be the best for you

That I'm looking through
Show only the beauty
'Cause they hide all the truth

And they let me hold on to the good times, good lines
The ones I used to hear when I held you
And they keep me from feeling so cheated, defeated
When reflections in your eyes show me a fool

John Conlee,"A story bout a pal of mine who worked down near the Georgia Line
A DJ in a little country station

Everybody loved him dear cause he played what they liked to hear
He built himself a quite a reputation

At record hops he stayed out late and his mom would always wait
To see if he had made it home alive

She warned against his loss of sleep and driving fast in that old heap
And that he had to be at work by five.

BJ the DJ you're living much too fast
And if you don't change your ways don't see how you can last.

Every morning just past four from the driveway he would roar
Overslept and he was late again.

Then at breakneck speed he'd drive to sign the station on at five
He had lots of records he must spin.

His mom said by the radio until his voice told her hello
She knew then that he made it there alright

Then she'd say a little prayer, giving thanks that he was there. And she'd wait up for him again tonight

Then one cold and rainy morn all the tires were badly worn
But still he screeched off just as fast this time.

BJ had a lot of nerve but he completely missed the curve
And he signed off down near the Georgia Line

Mom sat by the radio the voice she heard she didn't know
BJ'd never been this late before

But with the road so bad and all she'd wait a while before she called
And then she heard the knock upon the door

BJ the DJ only twenty four a wreck at ninety miles an hour he'll spin the hits no more. ",B.J. the D.J.,2009

The taste of silver spoons 
A clinical arrangement 
On a dirty afternoon
Where the fecal germs of Mr Freud
Are rendered obsolete
The legal term is ""null and void""
In the case of Beasley Street

In the cheap seats where murder breeds
Somebody is out of breath
Sleep is a luxury they don't need
A sneak preview of death
Belladonna is your flower
Manslaughter your meat
Spend a year in a couple of hours
On the edge of Beasley Street

Where the action isn't
That's where it is
State your position
Vacancies exist
In an X-certificate exercise
Ex-servicemen excrete
Keith Joseph smiles and a baby dies
In a box on Beasley Street

From the boarding-houses and the bedsits
Full of accidents and fleas
Somebody gets it
Where the missing persons freeze
Wearing dead men's overcoats
You can't see their feet
A riff joint shuts, opens up
Right down on Beasley Street

Cars collide, colours clash
Disaster-movie stuff
For a man with a Fu Manchu moustache
Revenge is not enough
There's a dead canary on a swivel seat
There's a rainbow in the road
Meanwhile on Beasley Street
Silence is the code

Hot beneath the collar
An inspector calls
Where the perishing stink of squalor
Impregnates the walls
The rats have all got rickets
They spit through broken teeth
The name of the game is not cricket
Caught out on Beasley Street

The hipster and his hired hat
Drive a borrowed car
Yellow socks and a pink cravat
Nothing, la-dee-dah
OAP, mother-to-be
Watch the three-piece suite
When shit-stoppered drains
And crocodile skis
Are seen on Beasley Street

The kingdom of the blind
A one-eyed man is king
Beauty problems are redefined
The doorbells do not ring
A lightbulb bursts like a blister
The only form of heat
Here a fellow sells his sister
Down the river on Beasley Street

The boys are on the wagon
The girls are on the shelf

That they're not someone else

The dust blows in

It's a fully furnished dustbin

Betrays no kind of life
But the smell of yesterday's cabbage
And the ghost of last year's wife
Through a constant haze
Of deodorant sprays
He says retreat
Alsations dog the dirty days
Down the middle of Beasley Street

People turn to poison 
Quick as lager turns to piss
Sweethearts are physically sick
Every time they kiss
It's a sociologist's paradise
Each day repeats
On easy, cheesy, greasy, queasy
Beastly Beasley Street

Eyes dead as vicious fish

Without a doubt these street are rife with corruption
Young minds get corrupted and so easily fucked with
Only leads to destruction in the end, false assumptions
That people have your back makes you believe they're your friends
Although some represent, no one can be trusted

One double-O percent 'cause some thugs will go to lengths
To get revenge
Even if it means manipulating youths to carry skengs
And do the dirty work for them
The kind of work for men

Not impressionable young children that never had a chance
Growing up in these manors most are doomed from the start

John Corbett,"Waitin' at a stoplight yesterday
As a funeral procession made its way through the gates
I watched it roll up a windin' road through the field of green
With whitehead snow's all in a row

And it made me think about where I'm at
On my not so straight and narrow path
On the generous and mostly undeserved
Blessings that I've had

Had an all American Mom and Dad
Some of the coolest friends you could ever have
Found love I thought I'd never find
I can't believe this life is mine

And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go, I'm good to go

I've said a prayer for the dearly departed
And the loved ones left broken hearted, and traffic started
And I drove away a little more able
To see the good things on my table for that I'm grateful

'Cause I've had my trouble, I've had my trials
I've hit the mark and I've missed by miles
I had days when I've been fightin' mad
But the good times have more than outweighed the bad

Got to hold my newborn baby girl
And the hand of a man as he slipped from this world
I've laughed so hard I couldn't stop
Seen the sunrise from a mountain top

Now, I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go, good to go, yeah

I've been thinkin' 'bout where I'm at
On my not so straight and narrow path
And I wouldn't want to change nothin' about this road
With the punches life I've had

Had an all American Mom and Dad

Found love I thought I'd never find
I can't believe this life is mine

And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet

Swappin' stories about all the wild women we've known
When the conversation turns, to you baby I've learned

That's a whole other case of the blues
That's a whole other heartache, a whole other headache
A whole other kind of hell that you put me through
It's gonna take a whole other bottle of whiskey to talk about you

Or the night in New Orleans when you stole my car

And all of those old fools you used to run to
They shot you full of old age
Well, don't go expecting too much, no, no
From this new love affair
Probably fall flat on its face
No one to pick you up, no one who cares

John Cougar,"Everything is slower here; everybody's got a union card
They get up on Sunday, go to church of their choice
Come back home, cook out in the backyard
And they call this the great midwest
Where the cornfields row and flow
They're all five years ahead of their time
Or twenty-five behind; I just don't know
All the young men talk about their four-wheel drives
And how much money they're gonna make on Friday night
And they like to brag about how they mistreat their girlfriends
Hey, let's get drunk, party it up, start a fight
And they call this the great midwest
Sure make a hell of a car
And the old hearts, they race their way though the night
The upheaval of who they really are
Growin' up under normal conditions, television and radio
That's just about all of this whole world
That any of us get to see, get to know
And they call this the great midwest
Where you sacrifice body and soul
And no one really wants to get even
Most of us find it hard enough just lettin' go
Don't get me wrong, I ain't complaining
I ain't braggin', nor do I mean to place blame
That's just the way things are around here
And there's a future carryin' my name on it
Sayin', hey man, you gonna stick around here?  You better get on it
If you're gonna stick around here
You better make yourself some real good friends
Well, I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth
So I can't talk about the big-city life
But if you want to talk about bein' bored and runnin' away from yourself
Hell, I talk to you all night
And they call this the great midwest
Where livin' is just gettin' by
And people trade in their happiness
For a smokestack, a big money deal in the sky",Great Mid-West,1979

Who toast their flesh in the sun
Living on allowances they receive from the old man at home
To keep up appearances, to have fun

[Chorus]
Hey, baby
Living in Miami
I know you're hip to those hotel alibies
I know you're nowhere near twenty
But I ain't the kind to kiss and tell, or tell lies

Well they are easy to look at; they are hard to hold
They have high opinions of themselves
But at night you can find them drinking in the bar
Wishing that they could find somebody else

[Chorus]

Well, they pull and tug on their high fashion clothes
As they strip off their armour in their apartment bedrooms
They wish that somewhere they can find a spark
Well, their sights, and visions, and dreams are set high
They think the world can be won with a smile
I hear 'em giggle out loud, lost in the crowd
Give me a cuddle when we get outside

Watchin' your life in vista-vision

He can shoot the eyes out of a pool ball
He can get the young girls into the sack

Locals will be kickin' up their heels
They'll be drinkin' tequila sunrises
Until the morning light fills up the window sills

And then I'll be with Sugar Marie
She's the only girl I know that can make me forget about me
Come on and dance with me, Sugar Marie

She works down at the truck stop
Where she polishes the spoons
She gets colas and burgers for the boys
On those hot summer afternoons
She's got this girlfriend named Linda
Linda's got a tattoo that says Christ
Well, she ain't half bad to talk to

I'll hold you close, taxi dancer
And I'll listen to how you outgrew your dreams, and how they faded away
I'll hold you close taxi dancer
And we'll pretend this floor is the Broadway stage

Well, she wasn't used to livin' in the city 
So she took a job as a maid, cleanin' up at the Gramercy Park Hotel
And all her auditions: they didn't turn out so pretty
So she took a job dancin' at the bar down the street as well

[Chorus]

Well, I don't know how long or how far her fortune did take her
But I heard she sits alone, drunk in a bar down on 42nd Street

And she'll stagger to the bar and dance with that girl for free

I don't know the reason

Some young tender hearts, sometimes
So I go to this party
With a bunch of me hardies

Don't get too smart
'Cause these people are crazy
They toot coke and drink wang-too
And they talk in some crazy tongue
There's a slit-eyed lady
Sayin' don't you be so stupid
I may be old, but I'm still good fun
Still good fun
Yeah, I'm still good fun

Well, I ain't that choosy
I'll flip-flop with a floozy
If I figure there's no strings attached
But sometimes I loose my feet
Underneath the back seat
And I have to fly my heart at half mast
Well, this old bitty
She was smart, and she was witty
She was really out of control, you know
It was stumble or fall
I had my back to the wall
I didn't know to bet on win, place, or show

Well, she shimmered and she shook
What she wanted she took
She shook like some rickshaw ride
She stuck her fingers down my throat
Till I almost choked
I thought I'd gone heaven and died
Well, she took me by the ear
And said what do you want to hear, boy?
You want to hear those crazy old lies?
I said nothing you can say, girl
Can drive me away
Just check my complexion
Make sure I'm still alive

I'd say, ""Hey, girl, you're the one""
And then I'd laugh when I'd take her home
You got your arms around my shoulders
You got my soul confused with my heart

Her attitude, the way that she smiled

I do believe you played it better
If it wasn't better, it was just as strong
I would've called you up on the telephone that night
But somehow, girl, it'd been all wrong

I heard you married a stranger
In a horse and carriage that was covered with gold
Well, you wanted to be different and still fit in
I wonder if you feel different at all now that you're older
Hope you didn't lose that innocent laughter
Oh God, I hope time didn't take that away

Old enough to know that these memories can't hurt a thing
Oh, oh, just watching the time grow

Well, I know it wasn't that big of a love affair
But, boy, it sure seemed like one back then
When I parlay the memories into their proper places
I can see, now, we were no more than friends
Oh, your kisses sure tasted sweet
But I guess any kiss tastes sweet at fifteen
I just hope your touch is as warm to your ol' man
As it seemed like it was to me

With sad blue eyes, walking on eggshells so you don't see her frown.
Is this your family, Jackie Brown?

Dream of vacationing on a mountain stream
And giving the world more than it gave you.
What ugly truths freedom brings
And it hasn't been very kind to you.
Is this your life, Jackie Brown?

Is this your meal, Jackie Brown?
Barely enough, I've seen people throw more than this out.
Is this your home, Jackie Brown?
This three room shack
With no running water
And the bathroom out back.
Is this your grave, Jackie Brown?
This little piece of limestone that says another desperate man took
Himself out.
Is this your dream, Jackie Brown?

What makes you journey into the night
And take flight on a pursuit of musical bliss?
Chasing beats through ghetto streets
To a dungeonous temple left by our soul descendants
In a quest for peace, energy and light.
If you were to find this temple, 
Do you have the knowledge to enter the temple?
Do you want it?
And if you had it, would you flaunt it?

A-flowing, soaring through your world
The fire burns within your heart
And now it's yours
If you feel it in yourself
I know the light goes through the stars

Acquiring entrance to the temple is hard but fair.
Trust in God-forsaken elements
Because the reward is well worth the journey.
Stay steadfast in your pursuit of the light.
The light is knowledge.

You.
Recharge your spirit.
Purify your mind.
Touch your soul.
And give you the eternal joy and happiness you truly
Deserve.
You now have the knowledge.

All the love we'd ever found
We lost the night it ran around in Reno
On the rocks that break the ties
But heartaches in disguise, the rocks of Reno

We did wrong by leaving home
And coming here to part
And although I've taken off my ring
You're still here in my heart

John D. Loudermilk,"See the tree how big it's grown but friend it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad the first day that she planted it was just a twig
And then the first snow came and she ran out to brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited slipped and almost hurt herself and I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
I surprised her with a puppy kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her when I came in from working late cause I would know
That she'd been sittin' there and cryin' over some sad and silly late late show
And honey I miss you and I'm being good and I'd love to be with you if only I could

She wrecked the car and she was sad and so afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be guess you could say she saw through me and hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly and found her crying in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring when flowers bloom and robins sing she went away
And honey I miss you and I'm being good and I'd love to be with you if only I could

One day while I was at home while she was there and all alone the angels came
Now all I have is memories of honey and I wake up nights and call her name
Now my life's an empty stage where honey lived and honey played and love grew up
A small cloud passes overhead and cries down in the flower bed that honey loved
See the tree how big it's grown but friend it hasn't been too long it wasn't big",Honey,1989
John D. Willis,"What we have here is a misunderstanding
A lack of communication, what we have here is
Two people talking and nobody listening
Screaming and yelling things hard to take back

There's worse things than dying
When you've lost your reason for living
There's no point in fighting
When reasons for staying are missing

I'm leaving
There's something out there that I'm needing
There's more to life, there's got to be more to life
Than breathin'

There are still echoes of you and me laughing
Bouncing off walls of canyons in my mind
Stirring up memories of love long forgotten
How'd we let go of something like that

There's worse things than dying
When you've lost your reason for living
There's no point in fighting
When reasons for staying are missing

I'm leaving
There's something out there that I need
There's more to life, there's got to be more to life

And I really don't care what some people think about me
I've been called a lot of things some good, some bad
I've had many people doubt me

I'm not ashamed of anything when it comes to this
I stay true to the game
And when the flames were burning slow
I grabbed the torch and let everybody know

What the music, the scene means to me
With pride and sincerity
Handed down by our brothers
Is this our legacy?

I've been around the world and back again
I've had the privilege of watching this grow
Transcend beyond the streets, the clubs, the trends
Beyond anything we had imagined

That's what the music, the scene means to me

Handed down by our brothers
Is this our legacy?
