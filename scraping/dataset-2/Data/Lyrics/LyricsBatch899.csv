Barclay James Harvest,"I give up my world
And giving it up, it ain't easy
I give up my life
And giving it up, it ain't easy

I give up everything I have
Even give this heart of mine
I would give up my soul
Giving it all for you 

I give up my time
And giving it up, it ain't easy
I've made up my mind
And making it up, it ain't easy

Give up everything I have
Think about this heart of mine?
I would give up my soul
Giving it all for you",Giving It Up,1978
Barclay James Harvest,"To our fore the harbor lights
Shining out like beacons burning
They can stop this endless night
They can stop the wheels from turning

Faces in a setting sun
Say again that we soon will be one 

Starlight rakes the silver wing
Bringing home its sons and daughters
No-one knows the state I'm in
Spinning swift above the waters 

Faces in a setting sun
Say again that we soon will be one",Harbour,1978
Barclay James Harvest,"THE BOY:
I was cast adrift, without a hope
My only friend is my old boat
With an empty sea and an open sky
A void no man can justify.
THE OLD MAN:
Your sacrifices will ensure
A port of refuge ever more.
Lost and drowned
We'll wait 'till England's found
Again.
THE BOY:
I was torn between what was good and right
And those who told me when to fight
So they left me here and they sailed away
To sink or swim 'til Judgement Day.
THE OLD MAN:
Your sacrifices will ensure
A port of refuge ever more.
Lost and drowned
We'll wait 'till England's found
Again.
THE BOY:
I was cast adrift.
",In Search of England,1978
Barclay James Harvest,"On a cold misty night
On the corner of Haight
She stood with a Colt forty-five.

The gun in her hand
Awaiting her man
A victim to take by surprise.

She's the Golden Gate Park killer
She's the scourge of Frisco Bay
Where she got herself beat up
And left for dead
By a man she felt true love for
But who left her out of hand.
Now she's out to take revenge on every man
As she stands there with a pistol in her hand.

The victim arrives
She looks in his eyes
He goes for the gun in her hand.

Karl Malden was great. (unlike the film, though)
But just a bit late. (this was the real show)
And got it right between the eyes.

She's the Golden Gate Park killer
She's the scourge of Frisco Bay
Where she got herself beat up
And left for dead
By a man she felt true love for
But who left her out of hand.
Now she's out to take revenge on every man
As she stands there with a pistol in her hand.

Barclay James Harvest,"How come you happened to be hanging around
When I was looking for a good time?
I thought I always had my feet on the ground
I've got the feeling that it won't be for long 
Take it easy, you're moving too fast
You're gonna make it, but let's make it last
The way you're dancing ain't good for my soul
The situation's getting out of control

(You've got me)
Turning in circles
Where do I go?
Turning in circles
Crazy I know 

How come you happened to be hanging around

Barclay James Harvest,"I'm hitting the road to heading nowhere
Got no place to go
I'm stuck inside my generation
Round and round I go.

I'm sick of the sound of Rolling Thunder
Times they were a-changing
And Rock'n'Roll died with Easy Rider
Tearing up my traces.

David Bowie was Hunky Dory
Aladdin quite insane
Give the sound of Arthur Lee with
Forever Changes, I'll remember
And more again, don't leave me ever
Buddy Holly said, ""Baby, please be mine""
All the time.

I'm cutting out now before the New Wave
Takes my surf board flair
Remember the time when Zappa said
""Punk, where you going with that
Flower in your hair?""

There's so many who's who's, Rolling Stones,
Rod Stewards and Small Faces
And Tommy's the King of Pinball flings
That chases my generation.

David Bowie was Hunky Dory
Aladdin quite insane
Give the sound of Arthur Lee with
Forever Changes, I'll remember
And more again, don't leave me ever

All the time.",A Tale of Two Sixties,1978
Barclay James Harvest,"Early morning,
It's cold and the sun is white
For I was born in
The darkness before the light

Of a new day
A new way of living
Of giving delight
And if you pay
Then you may be slipping
Back into the night

Then all knowing
With words and with pen I write
Of the growing
Of things that are in my sight

Early evening
It's cold and the moon is bright
And I believe in
The darkness before the light
Of a new day
",Early Morning,1979
Barclay James Harvest,"Oh Mother dear
What a night this has been
I awoke in the light of a vision in white
The prettiest girl that I have ever seen 
Lately my love, said the lady in white
I have watched from afar, but love draws me near
Now take my hand, hold tight, Mother dear
Do you know what this could mean, Mother dear?
Was it just another dream. in the night? 

Mother dear, on that same silver night Saw a figure in black by the lady in white
He said his name was death, was he right?
Do you know what this could mean, Mother dear?
Was it just another dream in the night?
Do you know what this could mean, Mother dear?
Was it just another dream in the night? 

Mother dear, what a night this has been
It's so cold by your side, no don't cry, can't you see?
Won't you listen to me please, Mother dear
Was it just another dream, Mother dear?",Mother Dear,1979
Barclay James Harvest,"I am walking in a dream
Everything I touch it isn't real
People aren't just what they seem
And I really don't know what to feel
Mr. Sunshine's not for me

I don't mind the sky of blue
Or the honey clouds that wander by
When that orange thing comes through
I must look away or think I'll die
Mr. Sunshine's not for me

Blacker days I'll never see
And I curse your light a hundred times
When you shine your rays on me
I must hide my head or lose my mind
Mr. Sunshine's not for me

My old man says I am mad
Said that things were saner in his day
But I didn't listen, Dad
All the words you said I threw away
Mr. Sunshine's not for me
Mr. Sunshine's not for me

Barclay James Harvest,"In the light of the night
Trying hard to forget
All the cries and the lies
Of the people she met

Hypnotized by the sight
That you're seeing and yet
Can't disguise in her eyes
There's a look of regret

So she drifts into tomorrow
Maybe she can find a better way
To love and see her sorrow
Vanish in the haze

Rock 'n' roll lady, keep on trying
Like the sand that is washed on the shore
Don't believe all the tears and the crying
She's running back for more

In the bars where the stars
Drink tequila and wine
Loud guitars, fancy cars
And the feeling is fine

See her face every place
Every movement in time
But don't choose or a loser you'll be
When she throws you her line

And she drifts into tomorrow
Maybe she can find a better way
To love and see her sorrow
Vanish in the haze

Rock 'n' roll lady, keep on trying
Like the sand that is washed on the shore
Don't believe all the tears and the crying
She's running back for more

Blonde and bronze, beauty fair
Photographed, cover girl
Unashamed, body bare

There's no story
She's a country girl at heart
There's no glory
She's just in it for the art, her part 

Sun oiled skin, shapely breast
Slim and sleek, without dress
Page two girl, page two world
Glamour girl, look your best

There's no glory
She's just in it for the art, her part 

Every day I'm waiting by the telephone
Every day you keep me hanging on
But while you're away, I think night and day
About where you're gone and how for long
Before our love turns to stone 

See you in the papers and the magazines
But a photograph's no good to me
But while you're away, I think night and day
About where you're gone and how for long
Before our love turns to stone 

Saw you for the first time and my shutter froze
Cameras clicked, we kissed and you were gone
But while you're away, I think night and day
About where you're gone and how for long
Before our love turns to stone 

Beauty contests were your only claim to fame
Then your body won over your brain
You stripped for the lights
And things went just right
Now you're suntanned right down to the bone
And our love's gone, turned to stone",Skin Flicks,1979

Like a bird with perfect wings denied the sky
But you don't know why Harry cried

Pass you on by with a smile

Or you just don't care Well something stirred today

Won't ever change now I'm over you

Won't ever change now I'm over you

The evening skies make me cry
Without your love

No one beside me who may doubt
All of the words that I could chose to say

And sit in the shade of an old tree
To think nothing much, just agree with my thoughts
To say nothing much, never tell what I ought 

Watching the people pass by now
They just don't know why or know how
They don't seem to care about all that I've seen
They just walk on by never knowing I've been

As long as there is someone there you know

Feels like a broken bone
Guess I'll go on home

Barclay James Harvest,"In corridors of air the clouds were waiting there
They knew that never again the skies would be so blue
They took away the sun and with it took the fun
It's true, and now there is really nothing I can do
So I look outside my window at the sheets of pouring rain
And I wonder if the sun will come again 

But the sun will never shine the way it used to do
The clouds won't let it through
Oh the sun will never shine its smile for me and you
The clouds won't let it through 

It wasn't long ago the people that I knew were glad
And nothing they ever thought about was sad
But since the sun has gone their laughing times are none
That's bad, to make them forget the happy times they've had
So they look outside their window at the sheets of pouring rain
And they wonder if the sun will come again 

But the sun will never shine the way it used to do
The clouds won't let it through
Oh the sun will never shine its smile for me and you

I dreamt I held a young man

We are love, we are, we are love

Got a ticket for my way back home
I start to feel like a rolling stone

I found a lady hanging on my sleeve
I said, ""I thank you but I have to leave""
She said, ""Stay with me, I need company
Take a sip of my wine
It's gonna make you feel fine
Come tomorrow, leave it all behind.""

The long lonely hours
Before the dawn
In my dreams I try
To hold back the dark
To hold back my fear

But I'm not alone tonight
So help me turn the tide
Light up the flame of love
And let it shine

I have hope, I pray
That someday we'll all
Have love of our own
In the long lonely night
I'll hold to the fire
That's burning so bright

But we're not alone tonight
So help me turn the tide
Light up the flame of love
And let it shine

We're not alone tonight
So help me turn the tide
Light up the flame of love
And let it shine

Barclay James Harvest,"There's a girl that lives in the shadows
Of the street where the music plays
There she waits and looks from the outside
There's an angel in her face
But from her glass she sips a little comfort
From the boys she takes a little more
And she knows just how far she can take it
In a moment she's out on the floor 
Hold on, she's got to keep a-moving
Hold on, dance with the light
Hold on, got to keep a-moving
Hold on, into the night 

In her eyes they thought they saw a question
Maybe she is looking their way
As the night gets older are they wiser?
Who will take her? No-one can say
Does she know just how they feel about her?
Can't she see she's driving them insane?
When the music starts playing again
They're saying

Hold on, she's got to keep a-moving
Hold on, dance with the light
Hold on, got to keep a-moving
Hold on, into the night",Hold On,1984

They're only there when things go wrong
Filming our blues for the late night news

Brother love for fellow man
Cure us, we are sick from violence
In your sideshow of life

A coin they have to spend
The currency of the chosen few
They place their bets

Come talk to me
Tell me of your walk
Through leaves of green
Where life was free

In soft pools of blue
How white mist like love
When you glow so new
Must warm to you

Tell me of snow

Must warm to the love of your heart
Warm to the love of your heart

A plane that brings relief
By fat men playing power games

I can see the rain begin to fall
Watch as the wind blows
Can you hear those voices when they call
Yesterday's heroes 

A game of consequence
We have to take the chance
And do our best
To keep the past alive 

Soon we will return
A lesson to be learned
By those who try
To keep the flame from burning

Searching for truth
Is it me, is it you?
Will our lives just crumble away?

Bare Jr.,"I gave you a kiss last Saturday
And you still will not give one back to me
You never have good apology
And your hooves never wrap all the way around me

And if you want something you gotta give something
You can't take nothing if you don't give nothing away

Sometimes at the movies if I buy you a soda
You do sit just a little bit closer
And while we're all spending my money
Sometimes you do smile but I get mad

If you want something you gotta give something
You can't take nothing if you don't give nothing away

Would you share with me?
And whatever I got is never enough [Incomprehensible]

I feel so special when you are close to me
And if you cared it all for me
You would swear to God that you hated me
And send me away with [Incomprehensible]

Always giving her body out
To anyone who'll listen to the reasons

And I miss you the most 
When you are close
You don't laugh 
At my jokes any more
Am I that much of a bore

But you ain't gone
Everything I do seems wrong
And though you lay

All that you feel is week

Bare Jr.,"I forget dreams and lies
I try and I try
Think you should know
Just what I like
You should by now, somehow, 
Be living without

Hold me up, I'm coming down
Headfirst for the ground
Running right by my side, 
Till the end
I would rather shine
I would rather shine in your eyes
I would rather shine
I would rather shine in your eyes
As you walk with me on this one way track
All that you give, I won't give back
So much of myself I hide from me
I want to be all that you say you see in me
I would rather shine
I would rather shine

I feel so free, I got nowhere to be
So why so I need a job
I once worked for an old bastard
Who always pushed me to work faster
He made fun of me
'Cause my hair was green
He tried to stick his hands into my jeans
My girlfriend is a stripper in Abilene
She likes me to stay home and watch TV
She pays for my food
She likes to be rude
She undresses her friends for me
I don't have a clue
What I want to do
Maybe I could invent
Something cool
Or I could do time
For committing a crime
Then sue for a million
Or two
I traded my car for a van
Filled it with gas, guitars and this band
They pay us with beer
We stole all this gear

Bare Jr.,"Your cousin Cindy touched me once 
I did not stop her so we carried on 
During family holidays 
She and I always found a way 
You never knew, you never knew 
You never knew I was so untrue 
Because I lied, because I lied 
Because I lied, I lied and I lied and I lied 
When I said I was with Paul I was with Felicity Jones 
the big-chested red head I swore I did not know 
She cornered me while you were buying me a beer 
She knew who you were but she did not care 
You may have been wise 
The whole time 
You knew the wrong 
Numbers were right 
I hope the whole time 
You were doing the same 
So I will not have to 
Swallow all of the blame 
You said you were leaving 
Because you did not feel needed 
So I lied as I tried to agree 
So you left me alone 
With me and myself 
So I drank and I drugged 
To become someone else

'Bout to get rowdy right now.
Yeah. I'm an all time factor, I make the next guy look like an actor.
So the mandam wail like they matter, when I touch mic I see the men scatter,
And they wanna talk big, but when it comes to big it they bout to get splatter,
So I tell them to relax yourself, go home to your mom and stop being a catta
Many guys wanna parr, many guys lookin to take this thing far
Many guys lookin to be some big star, but soon enough them man about to get slappa
So there's no need for chatter, no need for anything cheap and that's that
Anybody making a ting to get smacked up, back up, fam no need to sound back

When I touch mic I see the men scatta
Scatta, as if I had a clutch on a magnum

You're just another pawn in my game, another god figure pour in the rain,
I'm a raw one, too much of a force to contain,
And I'm forced to repay all the thoughts of the brain,
By any means I ain't putting pure spits to shame,
What I depict on scripts too much for the mandem,
And I keep calm when more shits a spray,
And when I'm letting off as if I had a clutch on a magnum.
See you making at me in the fashion,
Most of these mc's are straight gassin,
Yeah they getting paid on the JSA,
Like its something like guy got draper from Mad Men.
Bagging up while I'm racking hits by the minute,
I'm sick with the lyrics, so you best be backin up

doesn't matta cos when I ratatat bars watch the bare man scatta

You say you couldn't live your life without me

That makes me stoop
Or maybe it's a lack of remuneration 
I can't recoup
But if you want it folks, you got it

It's all my greatest hits
And if you are a fan 
Then you know that you've already got 'em

Disc Two, it was all brand new
An album's worth of songs
But we had to leave the whole disc blank 
'Cause some other label bought 'em

Disc Three, this is really me 
In a grade school play
I had about a hundred thousand lines 
But of course I forgot 'em

I never thought there'd be days Like this
There was always someone at my door
I never thought I would ever miss

Is what I used to be

Has got me in this mess

That's alright
You can hear it on the oldies radio Station 
Every night
And if you want it again you got it
It's right here in my box set

Disc Four, never released before 
And you can tell why
It's just some demos I recorded in my basement

Disc Five, I was barely alive 
I was hacking up a lung
Oh so they had to use a special computer as my replacement

Disc Six, a dance remix 
So I can catch the latest trend 
And it'll make you scratch your head and wonder where my taste went
Ah ha, yeah

So now my fans are crying sellout
They say I've lost my touch
They say I should just get the hell out

Looks an awful lot like someone whose name I just can't quite place.

Why did you clean the floor?
Why did you plaster over
The hole I punched in the door?

How is her temper this year?
I turned up your TV
And stomped on the floor just for fun

She loves me and her body keeps me warm, I'm happy here

You'll have to sign a waiver

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean?
Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said you're crazy
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait till you say you're sorry

Chickity China the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watchin X-Files with no lights on,
We're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford I'm getting Frantic
Like Sting I'm Tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy

Like Kurosawa I make mad films
Okay I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the backswing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad

You soon will

I have a history of losing my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to your sides and said I'm sorry
Five days since I laughed at you and said
You just did just what I thought you were gonna do
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame, but what could we do?
Yesterday you just smiled at me
Cause it'll still be two days till we say we're sorry

It'll still be two days till we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days till we say we're sorry

Alcohol, a party-time necessity
Alcohol, alternative to feeling like yourself

A Malibu and Coke for you, a G&T for me

My life never will
When someone else is picking up the bill

I love you more than I did the week before

I'll use something else

I thought that Alcohol was just for those with
Nothing else to do
I thought that drinking just to get drunk
Was a waste of precious booze

And there's a place where I can choose
To walk the fine line between
Self-control and self-abuse

I love you more than I did the week before

Found me on the floor

Tie my pantyhose around my neck

If I were a field, you would be in clover
If I were the sun, you would be in shadow
If I had a gun, there'd be no tomorrow

Perhaps as you I'll be worth noticing
Then even a eunuch won't resist
The magic of a kiss from such as me

You'll be glad that I have waited for you

And freezer-burned ice cream
I said ""Goodbye, I guess""
She lifted up her dress
And so I must confess,
We made out one more
Time before I left for good
She thought I'd come back but I
Wouldn't want to seem like other guys

A book-and-record love,
We sat and read our books,
Between those longing looks,
Compounded by our fear,
My tongue inside her ear,
My tongue inside her
In the basement of her mother's
House where she once taped the
First three sides of Sandanista! for my car

We were looking for ourselves
And found each other
In the Car
It was rare to do much more
Than simply mess around
In the Car
It was mostly mutual masturbation
And though we spoke of penetration
I'd have to wait for someone else to try it out

Once I had this dream
Where I slept with her mom
Unless I've got this wrong, a secret all along
Unless she hears this song,
Unless she hears it
On a tape inside her car
With her new husband and she
Turns to him and says ""I think that's me""

In the Car
We were looking for ourselves
But found each other
In the Car
We groped for excuses
Not to be alone anymore
In the Car
We were waiting for our lives
To start their endings
In the Car
We were never making love [Repeat: x3]",In the Car,1998

You and me as senior citizens in love

I followed your perfume out away from all the rabble
Right up to your room for a drink and travel Scrabble
You, stationed in the warm glow of the TV

We rolled around in robes and hotel sandals
Then you slept, and I dressed, and I left
And I guess I'll see you Monday like before

Now what can we say?

And you know in the wake that a heart's going to break

And your heartbeat is rushed

Naughty or nice, but consider the price to an elf

A full indentured servitude can reflect on one's attitude
But that silly red hat just makes the fat man look outrageous

Absurd though it may seem, you know, I've heard there's even been illegal doping
And though we're coping, I just hope it's not contagious

You try to start a movement, and you think you see improvement
But when thrown into the moment, we just don't seem so courageous

I make toys, but I've got aspirations
Make some noise, use your imagination
Girls and boys, before you wish for what you wish for
There's a list for who's been
Naughty or nice, but consider the price to an elf

You look at yourself, you're an elf
And the shelf is just filled with disappointing memories
Trends come and go, and your friends wanna know
Why you aren't just happy making crappy little gizmos
Every kid knows they'll just throw this stuff away

We're used to repetition, so we drew up a petition
We, the undersigned, feel undermined
Let's redefine ""employment""

We know that we've got leverage, so we'll hand the fat man a beverage
And sit back while we attack the utter lack of our enjoyment

It may be tough to swallow, but our threats are far from hollow
He may thunder, but if he blunders, he may wonder where the toys went

I make toys, but I've got aspirations
Make some noise, use your imagination
Girls and boys, before you wish for what you wish for
There's a list for who's been
Naughty or nice, but consider the price
Naughty or nice, but consider the price
Naughty or nice, but consider the price to an elf",Elf's Lament,2004
Barenaked Ladies,"I've followed footprints in the snow
Never knowing if I was right behind you
Looking down, no one would know
I wasn't walking hand in hand beside you
For your footprints lead the way
To a hearth where hearts we made surround you
You are awash in all its glow
I'm still standing in the snow

I stood and watched the lights go out
While the snowflakes settled all around me
Though it filled my heart with doubt
Couldn't move and this is where you found me
As our footprints disappeared
Snow erasing how I came to be here
I've got nowhere else to go
Now you're standing
In the snow
Look for understanding
In the snow
You look just outstanding
In the snow
Standing in the snow

Now it's almost Christmas Eve
And I'm surrounded with the sound of laughter
To give is better than to deceive
For I received a happy ever-after
You might have left me in the cold
A fitting ending for the fool that I was
But you'd be cuddled up alone
And I'd still be standing in the snow",Footprints,2004

At least it's only once a year
Perfect parcels tied with perfect bows
And carols ringing in my ear
Bundled up against the cold
Lines wherever gifts are sold
Each shop window displays a Christmas scene
For everybody young and old
Icicles on eavesdrops and tinsel on the trees
But it's a green Christmas for me

Couples skating on the pond (couples skating on the pond)
Making angels on the lawn (making angels on the lawn)
Five red mittens drying on the rack
And needle-shedding tannenbaums
Red bows on the railings
And snowflakes on the ground
But it's a green Christmas in this town

Green
Cause of everything I miss
All this mistletoe, no kiss
And with every Christmas wish
There would be no greater gift
Than to have this envy lift

Carolers are at my door
Don't want to hear them anymore

Why did you plaster over

How is her temper this year?
I turned up your TV
And stomped on the floor just for fun

She loves me and her body keeps me warm, I'm happy here

Yesterday you'd forgiven me

Like Sting I'm Tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy

Like Kurosawa I make mad films
Okay I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the backswing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes

All I find I leave behind

I should have known how,
Knots can come undone,
I should grown but,
I was on the run,
And the walls were crumbling,
And I was tumbling.

Should have just fell down,
Instead of making,
Such a hole in the ground,
There's no mistaking,
I will wear the crown,
I'm the lord and master,
Of this disaster.

[Chorus]

Anyone can walk on water,
Just before they drown,
Anyone can talk but they got
their story upside-down.

Dust coats the floor,
With every move we,
Seem to find more.
I'm out to prove that,
What we're working for,
Is worth defending,
And all this mending.

Barge Rabble,"""All the world's a stage,"" 
A friend of mine, he sometimes said,
And though he tried to show the way,
They only care about his name.
 
""Love is for the fool,""
A blind old man, he always said,
But of it's joys he sometimes spoke
And then it seemed, he could see.
 
""Life is for the strong,""
A travelling monk, he told me once
But of the weak, he never spoke
Though their cries beat on his ears.
 
I stood my gun in hand
The swallow flew to meet his love
And as they touched, I shot him down
But now it's me that can't fly.",Collections,1977

Time would have shown the parting waves
And you slipping under Autumn's gaze
And now I know that nothing is what it ever seems.

To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start

With her first hello she gave a meaning to this empty world of mine
There will never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart
She fills my heart
With very special things
With angle songs
With wild imaginings
She fills my soul
With so much love that anywhere I go
I am never lonely
With her along
Who can be lonely?
I reach for here hand
It is always them

How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answer now
But this much I can say
I know I will need her till the stars all burn away
And she will be there

I need someone who won't fall

That was full of you
Shocked to read the words they said
Tell me they're not true

Add you to my fallen list
One more has hit the ground
The fault was mine
I held you too high
Your only way was down

I have to find the perfect one
But I wonder if behind my need
There might just be a reason

Is my life just one big searching
For the one I can adore?
It never works
And I'm just left here wanting more

Could it be this hunger's there
To drive me to the one
Who's worthy of all worship?
Would my searching then be done?

Now she's driving to fast
She didn't care to glance behind
And through her tears she laughed
It's time to kiss the past goodbye

Don't try to tell me no
There's so much more for me
Just watch what I will be

Why are people freaking out?
Maybe I gave in more than I should, maybe I sold out
But the truth was I was really getting nowhere until I woke up and found
That morals can't take you up to the top your standards pull you down

Was it worth it what I gave away
For five minutes of fame
Minutes over no one knows my name
I always said the thing that meant the most to me was my very integrity
Who would have thought I'd ever trade it all for popularity
'Cause the truth is though I've made it to the top I'm anything but satisfied
I gave up the only thing that mattered for this empty life

To drain the living aptitude from those who feel entombed 
A species cannot tolerate predation from within
With power indiscriminate and lack of discipline

So with the captains of these mighty nations awash in a sea of blind mistrust
The man on the street receives information designed to conceal the obvious
Throughout this madness, an offer of true and lasting peace
To soldier and philosopher, demoniac and priest

And when the curtain falls around us in megaton torment
Because the kings of men have failed again in obscene impudence
It will only be the ending of a strange, tumultuous dream
For those who've found the Saviour, waiting and willing",Subterfuge,1983
Barnabas,"Spiritual warriors in life
Battles with sword in hand
I will fight the good fight in life
Conquering I'll make my stand
And overcome the ties that day by day the world hides
Knowing that I've found a place upon the solid ground

I'll always be a warrior
When I started to carry the warrior's sword
Evils came my way
Even though I would see defeat sometimes
I would never let it lead me astray
And I began to see the way true life could be
The opportunity to reach a perfect destiny

I'll always be a warrior",Warrior,1983
Barnbrack,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2000

What do we play now, Barney?
Let's see
How about some cool games?
Oh, that's a stupendous idea VJ
There are lots of games we can all play

When we're together, there's nothing better
Than playing a game with a friend
With games we all know, we can get up and go
We can make up new games and pretend
Laughing and running or singing a song
Climbing and jumping, all day long

I love it when we play together, playing games
There's nothing like playing 'em games
Everyone loves to play games
Let's keep on playin' our games

Dancin' along, we could play all day long
We never get tired of the fun
There's always a new game
Or one with a new name
A game we can teach everyone

There are many outdoor games
That we love to play
And others we save for a rainy day

You'll hear 'em playin', you'll hear 'em playin'
Soon you'll be sayin', ""Hon jazz me 'round""
Because your feet they can't refuse.

What's that familiar strain that true blue note refrain
It's drivin' me insane,
Can't keep still, tho' it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree,
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues, 
The Royal Garden Blues.

Everybody grab somebody And start jazzing 'round

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan? 
Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, 
Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, 
When I hear 'em play.

That weepin' melancholy strain, 
Say, but it's soothing to the brain;
Just wanna get right up and dance, 
Don't care I'll take most any chance;
No other blues I'd care to choose, 
But Royal Garden Blues.",Royal Garden Blues,1996

Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

I'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own.
Darling this place is a lover's oasis where life's weary chase is unknown.
Far from the cry of the city, where flowers pretty caress the streams,
Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea, 
Just me for you and you for me, alone! 
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us, 
No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear. 
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake 
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me, 
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do.
All of your schemes I'm admiring, they're worth desiring but can't you see,
I'd like to wait there for some future date dear; 
it won't be too late, dear, for me.

Of paradise, where roses grew

Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain

Soothing and slow

When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band

In a little log hut we're all our own

Ha, ha, ha, you and me, 
Little brown jug, don't I love thee! 
Ha, ha, ha, you and me, 
Little brown jug, don't I love thee! 
When I go toiling on the farm 
I take the little jug under my arm

Place it under a shady tree, 
Little brown jug, 'tis you and me. 
'Tis you that makes me friends and foes, 
'Tis you that makes me wear old clothes
But, seeing you're so near my nose, 
Tip her up and down she goes. 

If all the folks in Adam's race 
Were gathered together in one place, 
Then I'd prepare to shed a tear
(I'd let them go without a tear) 
Before I'd part from you, my dear. 

If I'd a cow that gave such milk, 
I'd dress her in the finest silk; 
Feed her up on oats and hay, 
And milk her twenty times a day. 

I bought a cow from Farmer Jones, 
And she was nothing but skin and bones
I fed her up as fine as silk, 
She jumped the fence and strained her milk. 

And when I die don't bury me at all, 
Just pickle my bones in alcohol
I'ut a bottle o' booze at my head and feet 
And then I know that I will keep.

The violets blue and so are you
And yet, I guess, before I stop,

Wind that sets the leaves to swaying 
Like some violin is playing strange and haunting melodies

That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair, she lost her smile, changed her style

And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1969

It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,1973
Barney Kessel,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1976
Barney Kessel,"No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low
Bye, bye, blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye, bye

Bye, bye, blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
Oh what hard luck stories they all hand me

Blackbird, bye, bye",Bye Bye Blackbird [Live],1977
Barney Kessel,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1981
Barney Kessel,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me,1981
Barney Kessel,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you
",What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?,1981
Barney Kessel,"You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart 
I feel like this is the beginning

Though I've loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears 

You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart 

You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And I know that this must be heaven
How could so much love be inside of you? 

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

People who need people,
Are the luckiest people in the world
We're children, needing other children
And yet letting a grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside

Barney Kessel,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before

Barney Kessel,"Little Lilly was oh! So silly and shy
And all the fellows knew,
She wouldn't bill and coo:
Ev'ry single night some smart fellow would try 
o cuddle up to her, but she would cry:
 
""Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
I'm beside him, Mercy!
Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ev'ry minute he gets bolder,
Now he's leaning on my shoulder,
Ma, he's kissing me!""
 
Lilly was so good, ev'ry body could tell.
You'd never see her roam,
She'd always stay at home;
All the neighbors knew little Lilly too well.
For when the boys would call, They'd hear her yell:
 
Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
If you peek in, Can't you see I'm goin' to weaken?
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ma, I'm meeting with resistance, 
I shall holler for assistance,
Ma, he's kissing me!""

Barney Kessel,"How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last.
How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

It's you or no one for me
I'm sure of this each time we kiss
Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Barney Kessel,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go

Just friends, but not like before

And it seems that I can see
The gleamin' candlelight,
Still shinin' bright,
Through the sycamores for me.

The new mown hay sends all its fragrance
From the fields I used to roam.
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash,
Then I long for my Indiana home.

Oh, I have always been a wanderer
Over land and sea,
Yet a moonbeam on the water
Casts a spell o'er me;
A vision fair I see,
Again I long to be;

Back home again in Indiana,
And it seems that I can see
The gleamin' candlelight,
Still shinin' bright,
Through the sycamores for me.

Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""
If you go, you know you'll grieve me,
All in life on you depends.

Dreaming dreams of you in vain,
I'm confessin' that I love you, over again.",I'm Confessin' (That I Love You),1994
