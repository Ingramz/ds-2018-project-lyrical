Dr. Dre,"When darkness be closin in
I'm motivated, with the howlin wind
With a list of chosen men, frozen in sin
Knowin that your end is beginnin
Swift silent and deadly
There's no defending my plots, I know your every movement
For six months I watch, coulda gotchu at your baby's mother's house
Even at your down-low weed spot
But the backdrop, wasn't flattering enough
I didn't want people gathering and stuff
Snapshots of blood splattering from the snuff
Here - puff this here, while I figure which way, to split yo' wig
Right now you as nervous, as a Farmer John pig
As I dig into my tragic bag, take out the HK
Twist on the silencer, insert the thirty-shot mag
Bullet stuck to his brain like a magnet
Skull in fragments, I leave the cleanup to Dragnet

This is anybody (Murderah)
To fuckin' everybody (Murderah)
Nigga all y'all (Murderah)
Uh, uh, for real
You'll fuck around and get killed
This is anybody (Murderah)
Motherfuckin' everybody (Murderah)
Yeah nigga all y'all (Murderah)
Uh, uh, for real
You'll fuck around and get killed

Peeped all the stash drop and exchange of the dough
Lurkin through the turf, think how I'mma just work
Give em chase to the crib and yo he properly laced
Stepped out the car, put my steel, to the side of his face
Murder - this the fuckin Case, rob this nigga and shake
The fuckin spot cause in a few it's gon' be crawlin with cops!
Who's the bad bitch now, you crept on, paid the piper
Who'da thought a sexy bitch could be a murderous sniper
Detrimental to your health, shoulda learned yo' lesson
But it's too late nigga bye-bye, better count yo' blessings
I been watchin you watchin me, yeah you ballin
Was, nigga now you finger fucked and steady fallin
A thug wit no love, but bitch niggas die fast
Thug niggas die young - oh what you thought you would last?
Blast two shots to the dome, slide back to the pad
And jack my nigga off, til his dick get soft
Resume the wifey boo shit, cause yo my man don't know
That his bitch is straight ill, servin ass with fo'fo'

I'm a motherfuckin (Murderah)
Bitch this is anybody (Murderah)
Yeah nigga all y'all (Murderah)
Uh, uh, for real
You'll fuck around and get killed
I'm a motherfuckin (Murderah)
Uhh bitch this is anybody (Murderah)
Yeah nigga all y'all (Murderah)
Uh, uh, for real
You'll fuck around and get killed!",Murder Ink,1999

Dr. Dre,"Yeah nigga, MC Ren up in this motherfucker
(West West y'all)
Yeah, L.A. niggas
L.A. niggas rule the world nigga
Y'all niggas gotta recognize, yaknahmsayin?
Niggas don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin' heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfucking world, nigga
Recognize this; peep game

Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover

I'm coming ""Straight Outta Compton"" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my max crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches

I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

In L.A

That's how we ride",Some L.A. Niggaz,1999
Dr. Dre,"Yeah nigga
I'm still fucking with ya
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E, '99 nigga
Guess who's back
Still doing that shit huh Dre?
(Oh for sho', check me out)

It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga?
My last album was The Chronic (nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed
They wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name
I'm ahead of my game
Still puffing my leafs
Still fuck with the beats, still not loving police
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets, repping 213 (for life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
Still hitting them corners on the lo-lo's, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
Still hitting them corners on the lo-lo's, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since Turn Out the Lights from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it
After-mathematics
In the home of drive-by's and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
Still hitting them corners on the lo-lo's, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
Still hitting them corners on the lo-lo's, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hitting them corners on the lo-lo's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back (So if you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

Right back up in ya mothafuckin' ass, 9-5 plus four pennies!
Add that shit up, D-R-E right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some with your dog, no stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky icky icky, ooh wee!
Put it in the air, oh, you's a fool DR",Still D.R.E.,1999
Dr. Dre,"Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Times is changing, young niggas is aging
Becoming O.Gs in the game and changing
To make way for these new names and faces
But the strangest things can happen from rapping
When niggas get wrapped up in image and acting
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags: when it happens, that's it
I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Watched 'em rise, witnessed it and watched 'em blow
Watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money: I lost them both
Went visited niggas in the hospital
It's all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show

Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (I watch)

I moved out of the hood for good, you blame me?
Niggas aim mainly at niggas they can't be
But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
I'm out of sight, now I'm out of they dang reach
How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
And choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot
I ain't a thug, how much 2Pac in you you got?
I ain't no bitch, neither
It's either my life or your life
And I ain't leaving, I like breathing
Nigga, we can go round for round
Clip for clip, shit, fo'-pound for pound
Nigga, if you really want to take it there, we can
Just remember that you fucking with a family man
I got a lot more to lose than you, remember that
When you wanna come and fill these shoes

Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (I watch)

Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
They wanna hang us, see us dead, enslave us
Keep us trapped in the same place we're raised in
Then they wonder why we act so outrageous
Run around stressed out and pull out gauges
Cause every time you let the animal out cages
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers
But now we got a new era of gangstas
Hustlers and youngsters living amongst us
Lookin' at us, now calling us busters
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us
Nigga, we started this gangsta shit!
And this the motherfucking thanks I get?
It's funny how time fly
I'm just having fun just watching it fly by

Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (I watch)",The Watcher,1999
Dr. Dre,"What's the difference between me and you?

Back when Cube, was rolling with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was banging with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business; but sometimes
The business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'mma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit'chu
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just being real wit'chu
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then I got these fake-ass niggas I first drew with
Claiming that they non-violent, talkin like they
Spit venom in interviews, speaking on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speaking your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting

I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting

Yo I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate and play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it
I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catching bitches while bitches be catching feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never come down! Pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About 5 bank accounts, 3 ounces and 2 vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath 'til ain't none left
Yo that's the difference

Aight, hold up hold up!
Stop the beat a minute! I got something to say
Dre, I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fucking weed is in me
(The fuck!) I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg
I got your motherfucking back (right?) just know this shit

Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch
I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed whose throat is it?
Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is

Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people (Hi!) Then drop her off on the corner
At the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
And they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for trying to talk like ""The Chronic"" was lost product
That's for even thinking of having them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, ""I Just Don't Give a Fuck,"" and see who means it!

Somebody better get this bitch, this bitch

I got these freaky hoes
Clapping they hands, stomping they feet
Every now and then they put they mouth on me
Nowadays a G like me can't even call it
A 23-year old pussy fiend and freakaholic
Pimping bitches on the regular, I put that on the G
A hustler and a player, nowadays it pays to be
Let me drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave your boy the head and said don't let nobody know
A bonafide pro, I had to grab the ho
She got freaky in your sixty-four, I skeeted in her throat
Been knowing the ho for four days, pimpin repays
And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the mote'
They be beeping me and shit, but we don't kick it no mo'

Sipping 151 that gave me too much pride to back down
Soon as we get to The Beach I'mma put my fuckin mack down

Walk with my hand on my Johnson, crack a smile
Cuties peep my style, if I don't get some ackrite
I'mma have to ack-wild

Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(Aight? So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

Uh drink kicking in, I'm stimulated
For those that don't know big words: I'm fuckin' faded
Eighty-three degrees, ease to a shaded spot
Our first spot was cool till some gangsters made it hot
Now we plot and pose
Plus we watchin' hoes, with lots of flesh exposed
Getting swarmed by those type of niggas
With no game but brown-nose
So I impose only like pros can
""Yo, is this your man?"" ""No""
Grab the bitch's hand, ""I'm Hittman""
Bling! Gold chain gleam
""You're very eligible for my summer league team""
Maybe too extreme cause the sister got steamed
Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethren
I got mad, spit flame on the name
Stefan, tattooed on her arm
Ho you ain't the bomb, must be a dyke
Witcho' lips swoll, and give a nig' some ackrite

Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

Fronting on the ack-rite, causing me to act up
Good Samaritans save that ho from getting slapped up
My homies crack up at the scene I made
Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade
If it wasn't for the one-time brigade
I woulda sprayed at the hooker tramp
As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp
Make tracks, where else can we go to take hoes
From fake macks? Ayo, chase them girls
In that black Maxima, the passenger, almost fractured her
Neckbone, looking back at us
Plus, they on the dick cause the Caddy's plush
They blush, I bumrush the hush, with the largest crush
Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch
Keep it on hush without the tip-in
Macking interrupted by some niggas set-tripping
Clip in the strap, I showed these niggas how to act

Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice

Forgave the less of 'em and blazed at the rest of 'em

Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a Beretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva
I roll wit' my shit off safety - for niggas that been hatin' me lately
And the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumpin' gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash

I don't sympathize for wack hoes and wimpy guys
You got to recognize Hitman is a enterprise

The Henny got me energized - smoke the guys
Tryin' to focus on mines - poke they eyes out
I'm L.A.'s loc'est - hope they don't have to find out the hard way
Like snitch niggas in the pen that get
Hit when the guards look the other way
We hittin' HARD, Hitman and Dre
You playin' games, I suggest you know the rules
We puttin' guns to fools, make you run yo' jewels
Take yo' honey and cruise to the snootiest snooze, Cabos

Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys, no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall
Full of plaques, hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'mma let my dough freeze, ho please
You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the oldies
Eazy-E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said motherfuck the police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see
Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped, y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me and turn me back to the old me

Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Then just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walking by
With a Walkman on
When I caught a guy
Give me an awkward eye
And I strangled him up in the parking lot
With his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hopping out with two broken legs
Trying to walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'mma kill you and them loud-ass motherfucking barking dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out
From here on out it's the Chronic II
Starting today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Slim Shady, hotter then a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Calling men ladies, sorry, Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me, it's okay, go with him Hailie

If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop coming up to me
With your hands out looking up to me, like you want something free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumping me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause I'm from the streets of Compton
I told 'em all, all them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around talking bout guns like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all, cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at

While you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch

All up in them panties, I got this bitch speakin Spanish
I'm mannish - get yo' nails out my back
Slut I'm bout to nut and get up, go scrub yo' cat
Learn the player rules, this is how I play a dude
Might not be a freak, but she got on the choosin shoes
Dollar signs are folded, I can't control it
Tryin to leave her, beeper just exploded
She sweatin me, won't let me, broad turned fraud
Now she on this dick huh, got her turnin tricks huh
Man it's a trip I don't trip I'm in yo' Lexus flexin

Name a sexual disease, she got it like Sam Goody

With more bouncin than a Zapp, she will doo-wah-diddy-ya
Prettier to grittier, the wittier can get her
To the Hotel, Niko, on some Sauve shit like Rico
That's when I caught a Vision like Coleco
A high-post ho, a perfect way for me to keep dough
Huh, have her sellin ass on Bronson Ave. and Pico

At the ho-tel, mo-tel, or the Holiday Inn (say what nigga?)
I said if that bitch keep fuckin up (beotch) then we'll fuck her friends
I said I dip, dive, what can I say?

Gimme some cash, pass it to Daz
Pass it to Snoop, or pass it to Nate

A message to God

Since you finishin em early, what posessed you to start him?
We made a vow later we'll regret til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doin when you made us; so with all due respect
You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feelin like my whole world is blinded wonderin why
Cryin, pourin out my heart, pourin out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, somethin we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguin tellin the truth
He had talent too I had plans on watchin him grow
Don't know what hurts more - seein him leave, or watchin him go

Youse a soldier, you're probably packin heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm goin through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keepin a poker face
To straight breakin down and showin all emotions
I'm anxious to believe in real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizin I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you

Alright, stop! (Huh?)

Fuck that!  Do that shit!  Shoot that bitch!
Can you afford to blow this shit?  Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies?  Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

Meet Stan, twenty-one years old. (Give me a kiss!)
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play (Shit!)
Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
(Yo! This girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?  (Uh huh!)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there

Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man
(What the fuck!)

Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off?
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitches head off!
Wait!  What if there's an explanation for this shit?
(What? She tripped? Fell?  Landed on his dick?)
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay!  Thought about it, still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say? (What's wrong?)
(Didn't think I'd remember?)
I'ma kill you motherfucker!
Uh-ah!  Temper temper!

Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?

I been there - been there
Done that - done that
You got guns? - we got guns...
Yo, I got straps - we got straps...
A million muthafuckas on the planet Earth talk that hard
Bullshit - 'cause it's all they worth...
No question, it's all about the D - O - E
So if money is the root I want the whole damn tree
Ain't tryin' to stock around for the Illuminati
Got to buy my own island by the year 2 G...
Since way back I've been collecting my fee
With the 48-tracks and the M - I - C
Got a palace in the Hills overlooking the sea
It's worth eight, but I only paid five point three
Worldwide, got the triple beam, I slide
Listenin' to yo demo in a stretch limo
It's how I ride - cartel style
Full, stacked to the max now
A million-dollar smile, people wonder how
'Dre Day' every day. Trips to Montiego Bay
With more chips than Frito Lay
Flossed jewels in a tire, ain't nuthin' fly
Straight or illegal - it's still the root of all evil...
Coz...

Don't expect for no man to support you

Kick back, relax, and grow old with my millions
That's where it's at. You got drama, I got the gat
But we're both black so I don't want to lay you flat
Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get
Private Jet, 600 coupes that I runs if...
I'm livin' on another level that why'all ain't been yet
Spend a mill, no sweat, water the line with my wet...

Honeys start to stare
'Cause game is money and money is game
And broke brothers make the forty five flame with no shame
Now many people die over these dead green guys
Ignorance and greed take their ass by surprise
It's the root of all evil and sins
Yet and still it makes the world go around
Like my twenty-inch rims...
Moolah why'all
Platinum plaques cover my walls
Grindin', diamonds shinin', and without one flaw
Get the cash, the grass, the ass will bounce

Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E, '99 nigga
Guess who's back
Still doing that shit huh Dre?
(Oh for sho', check me out)

It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? my last album was The Chronic (Nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed
They wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name
I'm ahead of my game
Still puffing my leafs
Still fuck with the beats, still not loving police
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
Still hitting them corners in them lo-lo's, girl

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed, I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since Turn Out the Lights from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

It's what y'all been waiting for Funk Master Flex, Big Kap,
Def Jam Records giving it to you baby.
Yo Eminem show these mother fuckers what time it is baby

I used to be a lonely man, only mad, until I got a million dollars, shit
Now if I only had some fucking hair I'd pull it, faster than a bullet
Out of Tupac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm trying to grow it back again, it was an accident

I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate the straight jacket it ain't latching, and can't lock it
So they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it

Before me, and just kept throwing they fucking self's at it
My head is aching, I'm dedicated to medication
But this med is taking to long to bring me this sedation? (Come on!)
Anyway I got down with Dre (What up?) 

The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
Running up and down the street screaming, ""Fuck the Police""
When you still had your mother's fucking Nipple stuck in your teeth
(Fucking baby) Became a role model after Colorado

Now all they do is follow me around and holla Bravo!

Suck my dick, bitch
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but I won't

So put a sock in it, with your fake-ass Tupac image
You faggots ain't tough, you just get drunk and become talkative
(Want to Fight?) I'm probably the awkwardest alcoholic talking

Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block stumbling, mumbling
A bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'mm juss high on life

So why on earth would I need drugs, when I can fly on kites?

I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron (AHH!)
Psych I'm just joking, for christ sake
Don't get so bent out of shape 

'Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just don't get it, but I won't let it upset me
'Cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck its like to be so fed up

And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of it's own, sometimes I can't find it at home

Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter fuck you lady

The neighborhood that I grew up in you could die for nothing
And Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth

And shove his head in the fan blade
Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say
Or change cause of the age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit

Quit fucking buying it, I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit
Hip Hop is universal now, it's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the white kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it

But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night get silent
Either that or booed, that's why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it let me see a judge

Ha ha, ride

All you see is the sun, reflectin' off of the gun
I'm ready for the showdown, that go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin' gold, waitin' for this drama to unfold
I got a {blunt} rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsters blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
But I'ma put thirty inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said

You never met me, and you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name's Slim, you want revenge?
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm tellin' the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you

[Chorus]
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun, when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cause the bad guys always die

He was ""Shady,"" I seen by the look on his face
He said take ten paces {shit} I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My {shit} went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
(You need bullets, hurry up run!) {*imitating Slick Rick*}
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
(Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want)
I figured he was tellin' the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do, it's on you
(Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?)
The Chronic!
(Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two)
(And plus I know who's got it)
Who?
(Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two)
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle 
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun (Dre here's the plot)

This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's goin' around sayin' he took the game from us
[Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin']
But he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission is to get him to stop layin' eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps

I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin' doors in, started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singin', it sounded like a ""G Thang,""
And a verse from ""Keep Their Heads Ringin""
I said ""It's Dre's Day,"" and started to spray
Against 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin' every which way

That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a {blunt} that's rolled

Dr. Dre,"Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play
(Shit is mine, I gotta do this, gotta do this)

Alright, stop! (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience

That's nonsense!
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Renee's razor blade

Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns

Fuck that!  Do that shit!  Shoot that bitch!
Can you afford to blow this shit?  Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies?  Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it! (You're right!)
Not over this shit (Stop!)
Drop the biscuit (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you

Meet Stan, twenty-one years old. (Give me a kiss!)
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play (Shit!)
Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
(Yo! This girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?  (Uh huh!)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there

Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'

While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off?
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitches head off!
Wait!  What if there's an explanation for this shit?
(What? She tripped? Fell?  Landed on his dick?)
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay!  Thought about it, still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?

Why you gotta lie to me?
Just be a man about it
Baby, you don't gotta lie to me, no
Just be a man about it
If you want to leave, go on
Just be a man about it
Come and grab your things and go on
Right now
Just be a man about it

I mean, you gotta understand I love you
You know what I'm saying
And I love you enough to say that I think
I think you deserve somebody better
Than me, you know
And right now, I can't give you what
You need, you know

I mean, I want to love you
And I'm gonna love you, one day
But you know, I mean, you just gotta understand
Where I'm coming from

You say right now that you're not
What I'm looking for
And what you really need is time to grow
You're promising that one day you may
Come around
And I'm supposed to let that go
But where the hell do you get off
Telling me your mama said
I'm not what you need?
Tell you what, since she knows it all
Then that's where you need to be

Just don't make no excuses, no, no
Why you gotta lie to me?
Just be a man about it
Baby, you don't gotta lie to me, no
Just be a man about it
If you want to leave, go on
Just be a man about it
Come and grab your things and go on
Right now
Just be a man about it

Can you tell me how you can
Say you're loved and then
Treat me so bad?
Boy, you know it just ain't right
I cannot believe the way you handled things
You wouldn't lie if you were a man

Just don't make no excuses, no, no
Why you gotta lie to me?
Just be a man about it
Baby, you don't gotta lie to me, no
Just be a man about it
If you want to leave, go on
Just be a man about it
Come and grab your things and go on

Hey, living in the fast lane
Driving fast 'broads'
With them fast 'chains'
When you pimping through life
See some people get caught up
And some charges brought up
With some people they shoot up
Hey, there it goes again
Different face to the same old tragic end
Who's to blame if he never saw it coming
Yet he heard the bullet humming
And he never though of running
It's too late for him now laying out on the ground so cold, so cold
Nothing much to live up to, damn
It's so far gone, so gone

Living in the fast lane
Driving fast broads
With you fast chains
When you pimping through life
See some people got caught up
With some charges brought up
From some people they shoot up
Hey.. tell me when will it end
When the baby pays for its mothers sinning
Trapped inside the four walls of a 'penty'
Way too strong, way too strong
Now she's out in the cold, dying slow and the spoon still warm

[Jadakiss]
It started when they birthed me
Running round stuck in the project now he can't wait to the first come
Little older now and can't wait till the dope come
Sleep all these years and nobody awoke him
Getting it so he can cover the whole border
Question is how many of us can hold water
It seemed like telling is in 
Signed states get an order of protection and tell him again
I'm a left lane
My life is much faster than yours
I'm with a chick and its attached to a brawl
Got the air ones matching the car
All white, slinging all night
So we rapidly spar
That's what they want to clap at me for
Understand that the flow is like the coke that he naturally grows
So I'ma get my cash on, and my mash on
And get my ass up out of the fast lane

Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E, '99 nigga
Guess who's back
Still doing that shit huh Dre?
(Oh for sho', check me out)

It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? my last album was The Chronic (Nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed
They wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name
I'm ahead of my game
Still puffing my leafs
Still fuck with the beats, still not loving police
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
Still hitting them corners in them lo-lo's, girl

And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E)

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed, I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since Turn Out the Lights from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

Laid back in the shack, play this track

I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back (So if you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

I plead guilty
On all counts let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress
Bed frame there's another dead pain
Laying lain with the shame, who's to blame
Me, the lady of Rage
On when I'm coming from the D-E-A-T-H in
R-O-W taking, no shit
So flip and you're bound to get dropped
It's 187 on motherfuckers don't stop
Handcuffed as I bust there'll be no debate
It's Rage, from cell block eight

Ayo stepping through the fog
And creeping through the smog
It's the number one nigga from the hood, Doggy Dogg
Making videos, now I stay in Hollywood
Busting raps for my snaps now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homey little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga
Shooting at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to death row cause I wanted to make a grip from serving my rocks
And I'm still, serving for mines, peace
To my motherfucking homies doing time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbing with your blues on, mad as hell
And you say yeah fuck the police
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's driving the cops crazy
But ain't nothing but a black thing bay-bee
No I'm not flagging, but I'm just sagging
I betcha don't wanna see the D-O double G
And you can't see, the D-R to the E
Or my motherfucking homey D.O.C.
You know you can't fuck with my motherfucking DJ
That's my homey and we call him Warren G
Yeah, and you don't stop
Doggy Dogg break em down with the motherfucking Dogg Pound
That's the only way we'll beat em man
We gotta smoke em, then choke em
Like the motherfucking peter man

It's a ride, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck 
But that's the life of a G, I guess 
Ese's way deep, shanked two in they chest 
Bests run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker

Bouncing off the walls, throwing them dogs 
Getting a rep as a young hog

I'm back up on my feet wit my mind on the money 
That I'm making as soon as I touch the street 
Things done changed but it's alright 
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right 
But it ain't no thing to me 
Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed O.G. 
The little homies from the hood wit grip 
are the ones I get with cause I'm down to set-trip 
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what ya want to do 
Didn't know we had a 22 
Straight sitting behind his back 
I'm grab his pockets and then I heard six caps 
I fell to the ground wit blood on my hands 
I didn't understand 
How a nigga so young could bust a cap 
I use to be the same way back 
I guess that's what I get (for what) 
For trying to jack them little homies for they bread

What'cha gonna do when you grow up 
And have to face responsibility 

Something for the real OG's to get wit 
Some facts, made our made, now you want to run and play 
Like every single day, really doe 
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamia, gaming them for my homie 
No need to be uncalm if you pack right 
And learning just enough to keep your sack right 
Late nights, I wonder what they getting fo' 
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting fo' 
Seven young G's put they serve down 
In a jeep ride, east side what they swerve now 
Not thinking about what's really going on 
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone 
I spent 4 years in the county wit nutting but convicts around me 
But now I'm back at the pound 
And we expose ways for the youth to survive 
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right 
So make all them ends you can make 
'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out 
So ain't no need for your mama to trip 
'Cause you's a hustling ass youngsta, clocking your grip

Journey with me
Into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killer
Since I came out the nut sack
I'm in a murderous mind-state
With a heart full of terror
I see the devil in the mirror
Buck buck, Lights out
Cause when I get my sawed off
Niggas get hauled off

*Barrel one
Touches your motherfuckin' flesh
*Barrel two
Shoots your fucking heart out your chest
You see I'm quick to let the hammer go click
On my Tec-9 so if you try to wreck mine
Fool its your bad time
Feel the blast of the chocolate bomber
Infra red aimed at your head
Like your name was Sarah Conner
Decapitating I ain't hesitating
To put you in the funeral home
With a bullet in your dome
I'm hot like lava
You got a problem?
I got a problem solver
And his name is revolver
Its like a deadly game of freeze tag
I touch you with a 44 mag
And your frozen inside a body bag
Nobody iller
Than this grave yard filler
Cap peeler
Cause I'm a natural born killa

[Ice Cube]
Terror illustrates my era
Now I can't hang around my momma
Cause I scare her
I'm quick to blast motherfucker
(yeah what's up)
It feels like I'm busting a nut
When I open you up
Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
All you weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss
Cause I'm giving dirt naps
Coming with them bomb ass raps
To make your lungs collapse
Perhaps, you never sleep
Cause every time you doze
You catch blows to the motherfucking nose
Ain't seen the sun, in 66 days
Let me count the ways ^in a fucked up maze^
I never ever ever made a ho stay
But I'm down with Dre
Like AC is down with OJ
So fuck how your living
I'm the unforgiving
Psycho driving
Murderer
Its authentic
Don't panic
I can't stand it
God Damn it
Schizophrenic
So fuck Charlie Manson
I'll snatch him out of his truck
Hit em with a brick
And I'm dancing

I don't understand the logic in my dreams
But I understand I like the sound of Sirens
Terrified screams from the streams

Cause motherfuckers want to violate
Now they stiff and cold
And they pupils won't dilate
It's so much pain

Headache
I can hear his bones break
He steps in the single door
Gets his ass whipped with 20 lashes

Who knows what evil lurks within them

And see what we find on this
Path 
Called
 
Stranded on Death Row, so duck when I swing my shit 
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits 
The gangsta type, what I recites kinda lethal 
Niggaz know, the flow that I kick, there's no refill 
I'm murderin' niggaz, Yo, and maybe because of the tone 
I kicks my grip, the mic and kick shit 
Niggaz can't fuck with 
So remember I go hardcore, and slam 
Nuff respect like a sensei, ba-bash like Van Damme 
So any nigga that claim they bossin 
What don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson 
Take a walk through the hood, and we up to no good 
Slangin' on things like a real O.G. should
I'm stackin' and mackin' and packin' a ten so 
When you're slippin', I slip the clip in 
But ain't no set-tripppin 
Cause it's Death Row, rollin' like the mafia 
Think about whoopin' some ass, but what the fuck stoppin ya 
Ain't nathin' but a buster 
I'm Stranded on Death Row for pumpin slugs in motherfuckers 
Now you know you're outdone 
Feel the shotgun, Korrupt inmate cell block one 

No prevention from this mention of sorts 
You're a victim, from my driveby of thoughts 
No extensions, all attempts are to fail 
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braille 
From the lunatic, I death like arsenic 
When I kick up wicked raps 
That the grain will hit the scratch 
With treachery, my literary form will blast 
And totally surpass the norm 
Not a storm, plural, make it, many storms 
When I'm vexed, I fly leg necks and arms 
In this dimension, I'm the presenter 
And the inventor, and the tormentor 
Deranged, like the hillside strangler 
MC mangler, tough like Wrangler 
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete 
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite 
So what you want to do 
The narrator RBX, cell block two 

Rage, lyrical murderer 
Stranded on Death Row 
And now I'm servin' a lifetime sentence 
There'll be no repentance 
Since it's the life that I choose to lead 
I plead guilty 
On all counts let the ball bounce where it may 
It's just another clip into my AK 
Buck em down with my underground tactics

Dr. Dre,"Who is the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfucking gun

44 reason come to mind
Why you motherfucking brothers' hard to find
He be walking on the streets and fucking with mine
Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind
See I never take a step on a Compton block
Or LA without the AK ready to pop
'Cause them punk motherfuckers in black and white
Ain't the only motherfuckers I gots to fight
I thinks it's better to be retelling the facts than cuffed up
And jacked and fucked up
What you niggas looking at? You going
Goddamn! 'cause it's the city
And for you to survive a nigga gotta be a gangsta
And I'm a nigga you can't remove
Took out a lot of motherfuckers for trying to prove
To their homies that they can hang by dealing with me
But once again in the end they D-E-A-D
I never did time on a murder yet
'Cause I relax and back, do a job and jet
Yo I know you understand my flow
So here we go with Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know

Who is the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfucking gun
Who is the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfucking gun

D-R-E
A motherfucker who's known for carryin gats
And kick raps that make snaps
Adapts to any environment that I'm located at
If you see me on the solo moves best believe that I'm strapped
4-4, .tre-8 or AK-47
'Cause slowly but surely send you on a stairway to heaven
Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back
And lay a punk motherfucker flat
As he wonder what popped before he got popped
I told you I was Dre and you know it don't stop
Now I know you understand my flow
So here we go with Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know

I breaks em off, I breaks em off yeah
I breaks em off, I breaks em off yeah
I breaks em off but I ain't speaking about between the thighs
I'm talking about cocking a gauge in between your eyes
That'll make you drop to your knees 'cause you realize
That a gat will make any nigga civilized
Old buster ass nigga talking bullshit
Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
Get lit or hit up by the doctor
A nigga that breaks em off properly
Real G so doubt it
I'm the one who's doing it while these other niggas talk about it
And if motherfuckers come at me wrong
I straight put my .44 Desert Eagle to his motherfucking dome
And show him why they call me the notorious one
The name's Dre Eastwood when I'm packing a gun
You don't believe me, well step up and give it a try
And if you die you's a buster 'cause real niggas don't die
But some still don't hear me though
You're too near me not to hear me, nigga yo

Dr. Dre,"Yeah, it's what I do for a living nigga
Eat for a living nigga (watcher)
That's how I live for a living nigga (watcher)
Okay, let's do this (the watcher)

Things just ain't the same for gangsters
But I'm a little too famous to shoot these pranksters
All of these rap singers claiming they bangers
Doing all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
Disrespecting the game, no home training or manners
I was doing this shit when you was shitting Pampers
I was moving them grams 'fore you, knew what a hand that hand was
Ducking the vans, radars, the scanners
'Fore you knew what hard white to tame was
I was hitting the turnpike, aight with the bammers
I was nice with my hands, cuss aight with them hammers
I was pricking my finger 'fore you knew what a Fam was
I had it laid out before you knew what a plan was
Three hundred mill' later, now you understand us
Y'all ain't see us coming through Vegas
You ever seen so much cham' bust in one night
Grand fucked up one fight
I was on the Peter Pan bus
You was Peter Pan up in your room, y'all fucking with whom?
Allowed me to be taught
You cowards is just now learning the shit that we talk
You niggas ain't know about a Robb Report
Bout a high speed Porsche, i.e.
You niggas ain't know how to floss 'til I came through the door
like ""Eric B. for Pres,"" respect me in this bitch!
You can't disrespect us cause you got a little check cut
You was sucking for so long, fucking your little neck up
Now you too big for your britches, you got a few little bitches
You think you Hugh Hefner, you just ridiculous
I blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game
It's only right I got the right to be king
Niggaz that got life really like what I sing
Cause they know is he really like, niggas feel my pain
Know the shit I DON'T write be the illest shit that's ever been recited
in the game word to the hyphen in my name!
J, A, Y, DASH, Hoffa
The past present nigga the future, proper
The holy trinity of hip-hop is us
We give, Dre his props BUT that's where it stops
It's the Roc

[Chorus]
I know, you got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
(Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as before)
(People I used to know, just don't know me no mo')
(But everywhere that I go, I got people I know)
(Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)

I'm still on top of the game
Still dropping flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top had the Roc for the fame
over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came
You seen it all, how I got, how I gained
The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
the streets, they made a special spot for my name
Dre, haters wanna stop to my reign
But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain
All the way back from the rise of my name
See the world clear through the eyes of the mane
See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave
When the beat bangs it'll drive them insane
The eyes that I played
The best to emerge in the game is The Watcher

[Chorus]

I'm ""Rated R,"" my brain contains graphics things
It turn traumatic teens into addicts, and fiends
It's like, watching a movie through a panoramic screen
Which means, I can see the whole planet in the scene
Cash is the topic, the object, a fatter pocket
Some take the crack and chop it, but those that haven't got it
take away the added profit, it's catastrophic
I take the gat and cock it, and I'll sit back and watch it
These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully
The world is mine and can't nobody keep it from me
Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny
In the place where the number one cause of death is money
You can try coping
I've seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
I'm still alive and scoping
Be another hundred years 'til my skies close in
And I'ma die with my eyes open, the watcher

Dr. Dre,"So I'm out the game, huh?
Yo, Dre, we ridin'?
Whatever
Haha, well, I'm with you, homie
Okay, let's handle the small shit

I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
Kick up dust, cuss 'til I slur up spit
Grew up too quick, went through too much
Knew too much shit, corrupt
And I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick and rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to Earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep going
First take I make, mistakes, just keep it
No punches pulled, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit I'll eat shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit

Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age
(But what about Jermaine?) Fuck Jermaine!
He don't belong speaking mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think I don't read your little interviews
And see what you're sayin'
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked
When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me with a bunch of little mini-yous
Running around your backyard swimming pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with ten- or eleven-year-olds

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?

Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss from a Dixie cup
If you ever mix me up
Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri
We'll rub it in, every club you're in
Or have you blackballed
And make sure you never rap a-fucking-gain
Dre ain't having it, long as I'm here to play devil's advocate
If there was some magic shit I could wave over the industry
That could save it when I'm gone and buried
To make sure the tradition carries on, I would
If I could only use this power for good
I wouldn't, not even if I could
From the hood, and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered
And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fucking head off
'Cause I know if they get up
I won't get a chance to let off another punch
I'm punk rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck, white-Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mil'
Or grow up to be Attilla, go nuts and be a killer
And I'm something of a phenom, one puff of the chron'
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us (c'mon!)

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?

Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows I'm about fast cars and Alizé, partying all day
But I handled my business, 'cause it's work before play
Don't look for trouble, but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sending it your way
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
'Cause this is my space, you invade it
Live to regret it, and you'll die trying to violate it
Fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dilated

Huh, like my old lady
'Cause what you say is what you say
Sometimes what you mean is two different things
Depending on your mood if it swings
Think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed
I can do anything, catch a contact and I'm gone
And I'm back, I speed write
And my loose leaf's my launchpad
And I can pull any string, don't have to prove anything
Catch a contract on your head
You headed West, talk shit about Dre
You better get a vest and invest
In something to protect your head and neck
And it's back and forth all day, like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth
But a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend I'ma die a sudden death
Five mics in The Source? Ain't holding my fucking breath
But I'll suffocate for the respect
'Fore I breathe to collect a fucking check

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it

Nickname Eazy E your 8 ball junkie 
Bass drum kicking to show my shit 
Rap a hole in my dick boy I don't quit 
Crowd rocking motherfucker from around the way 
I got a six shooter yo I'm mean and brave 
Rolling through the hood to find the boys 
Kick dust and cuss crank up some noise 
Police on my drawers I have to pause 
Forty ounce in my lap and it's freezing my balls 
Hook a right turn and let the boys go past 
And I say to myself, ""They can kiss my ass"" 
Hip to get drunk got the 8 in my lips 
Put in the old tape Marvin Gaye's greatest hits 
Turn the shit up had the bass cold whomping 
Cruising through the east side south of Compton 
See a big ass and I say word 
I took a look at the face, and the bitch was to the curb 
Hoes on my tip for the title I'm holding 
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the eight ball rolling 

Riding on Slauson down towards Crenshaw 
Turned down the sound to ditch the law 
Stopped at a light and had a fit 
'Cause a Mexican almost wrecked my shit 
Flipped his ass off put it to the floor 
Bottle was empty so I went to the store 
Nigga on tip 'cause I was drunk 
See a sissy ass punk had to go in my trunk 
Reached inside cause it's like that 
Came back out with a silver gat 
Fired at the punk and it was all because 
I had to show the nigga what time it was 
Pulled out the jammy and like a mirage 
A sissy like that got out of Dodge 
Sucka on me cause the title I'm holding 
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 Ball rolling 

Olde English eight hundred cause that's my brand 
Take it in a bottle, forty, quart, or can 
Drink it like a madman yes I do 
Fuck the police and a 502 
Stepped in the park I was drunk as hell 
Three bitches already said, ""Eric your breath smells!"" 
40 ounce in hand that's what I got 
""Yo man you see Eazy hurlin' in the parking lot?"" 
Stepped on your foot cold dissed your hoe 
Asked her to dance and she said, ""Hell No!"" 
Called her a bitch cause that's the rule 
Boyz n tha Hood trying to keep me cool 
Tell my homeboy you want to kick my butt 
I walked in your face and we get on up 
I start dodging the dogs and watch you fall 
Just dumb full of cumn got knocked out cold 
""Make you look sick you snotty nosed prick! 
Now your fly bitches all over his dick!"" 
Punk got dropped cause the title I'm holding 
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling 

Pass the brew mother fucker while I tear shit up 
And you all listen up close to roll call 
Eazy-E's in the place I got money and juice 
Rendezvous with me and we make the deuce 
Dre makes the beats so goddamn funky 
Do the Olde eight fuck the brass monkey 
Ice Cube writes the rhymes, that I say

It's a new day, but it all feels old
It's a good life, that's what I'm told 
But everything, it all just feels the same
At my high school, it felt more to me like a jail cell, a penitentiary
My time spent there it only made me see

That I don't ever want to be like you 
I don't want to do the things you do
I'm never gonna hear the words you say
And I don't ever wanna.
I don't ever want to be.you.
Don't want to be just like you
What I'm saying is this is the anthem
Throw all your hands up you.
Don't want to be you

Go to college, a university, get a real job
That's what they said to me 
But I could never live the way they want
I'm gonna get by and just do my time
Out of step while they all get in line
I'm just a minor threat, so pay no mind

Do you really want to be like them,
Do you really want to be another trend,
Do you want to be part of that crowd
Cause I don't ever wanna.
I don't ever want to be you.
Don't want to be just like you

Could've reached the peep, now you're left with a horrible leak
I'm tryin to be as bleak with my speech as possible
Just in case a nigga tryin to throw me an obstacle
Nigga, I'm not boxin you, I'm hospitable
I put you in a hospital, that's how I get at you
Let the doc op on you, he don't rid you?
You back on the streets? I send another hit at you
This is not a hypocritical issue
I will critical condition your tissue
Give a fuck if all ten of them wit you
I throw an extra ten of them missiles
Turn gangstas into gentlemen vicko
And ever since Eminem dissed you
I swear I see the women and bitch in you
All this bickering back and forth over who signs who
Curtis, pull your skirt up, nigga, you got murdered
Now take it like a man and shake it off. Damn
And quit tellin all these magazines your plans
How you gone slap up my mans, you're fictitious
Nigga, we send Stan to come murder your bitches

What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?
I said What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
And show us you're as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?

Hahahahahaha
Yeah, yeah
Go out behind all the gangstas you want, nigga
Matter fact, go get every gangsta from every hood
In the United States of America to back you, nigga
Ain't nobody rap wit you
You can't see that?
Fell off, nigga

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

Get your ass up for the Doctor, one more time
Get your ass up for the Doctor, c'mon now!
Here we go, cliffhanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat, get on down
Time's up, game's over, you lose, I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you somethin' that we already had
But once you're gone you don't come back
Too bad, you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
Why I send multi-platinum albums, later three diamond
Worldwide, we on the charts with a bullet, and still climbin'

When Dr. Dre says crunk, you will get it crunk!
Get it crunk (crunk, crunk, crunk)
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and
Jump (jump, jump, jump)
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you artists censored
I don't gotta promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges
We ain't showin' off, we're just goin' off, popular contentions
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk, Doc is all
Washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin'
Doctor's this, Doctor's that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
So D-J take the needle and just drop it on the record, what?
We goin' have this motherfucker hoppin in a second (pump pump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers whom if it
Wasn't for rap to bridge the gap maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages, broke down barriers
Of language and races, just call on the caped crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game that's why we came to

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

50 Cent, c'mon!

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump, everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
And plenty hunnies involved, the sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, every day is just another party from the valleys
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
So never say never cause Shady, Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records, presents the return of
The, The Doc (and Shady) no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that uh

Cause we came here to set this party off right

Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? My last album was ""The Chronic"" (nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

If you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police (Uh huh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (fo sho)
Still got love for the streets, repping two one three (fo life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E   

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing fifty a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
It's ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E   

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back

So if you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

Get your a** up for the Doctor, one more time
Get your a** up for the Doctor, c'mon now!
Here we go, cliffhanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat, get on down
Time's up, game's over, you lose, I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you somethin' that we already had
But once you're gone you don't come back
Too bad, you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and b****in'
Sit and observe, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
Why I send multi-platinum albums, later three diamond
Worldwide, we on the charts with a bullet, and still climbin'

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

When Dr. Dre says crunk, you will get it crunk!
Get it crunk (crunk, crunk, crunk)
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and
Jump (jump, jump, jump)
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you artists censored
I don't gotta promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges
We ain't showin' off, we're just goin' off, popular contentions
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk, Doc is all
Washed up, knock it off, who the f*** is Doc impressin'
Doctor's this, Doctor's that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the c*** of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
So D-J take the needle and just drop it on the record, what?
We goin' have this motherf***er hoppin in a second (pump pump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers whom if it
Wasn't for rap to bridge the gap maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages, broke down barriers
Of language and races, just call on the caped crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game that's why we came to

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

50 Cent, c'mon!

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump, everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
And plenty hunnies involved, the sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, every day is just another party from the valleys
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
So never say never cause Shady, Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records, presents the return of
The, The Doc (and Shady) no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that uh

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

Yeah! Ha ha

Flossing but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous cause we program worldwide

Bumping and grinding like a slow jam, it's west side
So you know the row won't bow down to no man

Dr. Dre,"You're back now at the jack-off hour this is DJ, Eazy Dick
On W-Balls, right now, something new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, 'cause we gonna make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
Cause I have never
Met a girl
That I love
In the whole wide world

Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's something I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch!

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do?  You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on back
So back up bitch 'cause I'm struggling, so get
Off your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout

Ain't that something, talk shit and I'm dumping

Don't sweat, but check the technique, I'm unique like China
Ya never find the bomb-a-rama then this Nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
One-two, three, you can't see me
I'm a G like that strapped with hit hard tactics
A fucking menace, using hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and popping
All I see is green, so there ain't no stopping
I want to see some panties dropping
I'm coming from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that hoe
 Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I'm dishing out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catching slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked
But it's mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be sticking and moving
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head hunting
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murdering with rhymes packing Tec-9's for some action
You really don't know, do you, you fucking with a hog
You can't do me, I'm going out looney like O-Dog

Hey, living in the fast lane
Driving fast 'broads'
With them fast 'chains'
When you pimping through life
See some people get caught up
And some charges brought up
With some people they shoot up
Hey, there it goes again
Different face to the same old tragic end
Who's to blame if he never saw it coming
Yet he heard the bullet humming
And he never though of running
It's too late for him now laying out on the ground so cold, so cold
Nothing much to live up to, damn
It's so far gone, so gone

Living in the fast lane
Driving fast broads
With you fast chains
When you pimping through life
See some people got caught up
With some charges brought up
From some people they shoot up
Hey.. tell me when will it end
When the baby pays for its mothers sinning
Trapped inside the four walls of a 'penty'
Way too strong, way too strong
Now she's out in the cold, dying slow and the spoon still warm

[Jadakiss]
It started when they birthed me
Running round stuck in the project now he can't wait to the first come
Little older now and can't wait till the dope come
Sleep all these years and nobody awoke him
Getting it so he can cover the whole border
Question is how many of us can hold water
It seemed like telling is in 
Signed states get an order of protection and tell him again
I'm a left lane
My life is much faster than yours
I'm with a chick and its attached to a brawl
Got the air ones matching the car
All white, slinging all night
So we rapidly spar
That's what they want to clap at me for
Understand that the flow is like the coke that he naturally grows
So I'ma get my cash on, and my mash on
And get my ass up out of the fast lane

Snoop Dogg, it is what it is
This record is so motherfuckin' gangsta man
And I think it's time for me and you to just
Turn it down a bit
Come on

Imagine it never happened
Imagine no rappin'
Imagine niggas trapped
Imagine it havin' action
Imagine how niggas could be actin'
If you never got this shit crackin
Imagine life's so hard
You can't imagine it's like livin' in city of god
You feel me
Imagine life on the yard
I'm tryin' to get that dollar on some shitty ass job
Imagine Biggie with his son
Imagine Pac gettin' call pop 'bout one
Imagine a mother struggling
Dealing with a system that don't give a fuck about who shot her son
Imagine life you can't win
When you get out of the ghetto and go right to the pen
When you get out to the pen you go right to the jenz
When you put back to the streets you get right back in
Imagine Russell still struggling
No Def Jam it's another nigga hustlin'
And no rocks on them fellas
Just rocks on them fellas
Just try and keep it bubblin'
Imagine niggas just stoped
From the east to the west coast, everybody fucked up
I can't imagine no less
But it don't take imagination
To know niggas been bless with

Before we go
Can you imagine?
Picture years, with your mom
Can you imagine?
Hang her picture in the sky
Can you imagine?
Call emergency I've been dreamin' all my life

Could you imagine bein' lit up by some hot shells?
Imagine being tossed around and put in jails
Imagine life when you can't get from under
Imagine niggaz at ya when you done fo'
Remember when they asks ya why ya run for and treat ya like a bitch
When they kick you in your dick and take your shit
We act like we hate to see you gun hoe
But just imagine if the rappin' got the gun no but you already know.
Imagine niggas in the LBC felt just like Snoop Dogg & D-R-E,
And felt just like the niggas in the 2-1-3.
Then imagine us was comin' when you fuckin' with me.
Imagine you was up on top of this shit
Imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick
I mean imagine we said fuck this shit
Imagine if my niggas got together and tow up this bitch, yeah
You can't imagine growin' up in the jail done
Happy just to be alive' watching all your people run
Would you imagine growin' up to sell your 50 million records world wide or fuckin' on somebodies son
Imagine if these niggas never saw a color
Would it be peaceful in them streets where niggas kill each other
All the drunk fool gets pissed on balls
He fuckin' off my niggas, they gone murder us all

It's a ride, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck 
But that's the life of a G, I guess 
Ese's way deep, shanked two in they chest 
Bests run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker 
Ugn, too late, damn, down goes another nigga 
Bouncing off the walls, throwing them dogs 
Getting a rep as a young hog 
It ain't nothing like the street life 
Betta be strapped wit yo clip, 'cause ain't no fist fight 
So I guess I gots ta handle mine

Now, I'm 'trolling the dove, sitting on swoll 
27 years old, off on parole, stroll 
I'm back up on my feet wit my mind on the money 
That I'm making as soon as I touch the street 
Things done changed but it's alright 
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right 
But it ain't no thing to me 
Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed O.G. 
The little homies from the hood wit grip 
are the ones I get with cause I'm down to set-trip 
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what ya want to do 
Didn't know we had a 22 
Straight sitting behind his back 
I'm grab his pockets and then I heard six caps 
I fell to the ground wit blood on my hands 
I didn't understand 
How a nigga so young could bust a cap 
I use to be the same way back 
I guess that's what I get (for what) 
For trying to jack them little homies for they bread 

Lil' ghetto boy 
Playing in the ghetto streets 
What'cha gonna do when you grow up 
And have to face responsibility 

Something for the real OG's to get wit 
Some facts, made our made, now you want to run and play 
Like every single day, really doe 
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamia, gaming them for my homie 
No need to be uncalm if you pack right 
And learning just enough to keep your sack right 
Late nights, I wonder what they getting fo' 
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting fo' 
Seven young G's put they serve down 
In a jeep ride, east side what they swerve now 
Not thinking about what's really going on 
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone 
I spent 4 years in the county wit nutting but convicts around me 
But now I'm back at the pound 
And we expose ways for the youth to survive 
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right 
So make all them ends you can make 
'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out 
So ain't no need for your mama to trip 
'Cause you's a hustling ass youngsta, clocking your grip

Inside a Ferrari with the D-are-E
Run up I let it sing like Nate D-O-double-G

Walk through 8 Mile, G-Unit's on my feet
Got a cherry lowrider in the N-why-see
Eve took me to Philly, never been to the pen
Been to Uptown with 50, seen niggaz in Timbs

I done seen Young Buck scuff Air Force One's
In Cashville, but Compton is
Where it's just me, my son, and my bitch
She graduated when Notorious B.I.G. dropped ""Me and My Bitch""

She get them birds past, I put her in first class
And tell her to carry on that Duni and Burke bag
She from Grape Street, she know how to work the mag
And only buy white tees, tell 'em to keep the purple tags

'Cause the laces in my Chucks keep the beef crackin'
I lay niggaz out like creased khakis
In that G-wagon, lean like the 23's draggin'

Play both sides of the fence, 'cause the Crips feel cause'
See me ridin with Nate, nigga it's still Blood
You can see-walk to this, homey it's still love
Nigga I've been bangin' since Mary J. did ""Real Love""

I painted the Rover black
The West coast is back, I can smoke to that
Mom's got the CL-6, that's a fact
I bought the house, I'm just waitin on the platinum plaques

I'm the one who needs no introduction
'Cause I'm the world class doctor
The master of seduction
I can heal all your ills
And give you extreme delight
But only if you allow me
To turn off the lights

Before you turn off the lights
Let's get one thing understood
If you plan to make love to me
You've got to do it good
'Cause I'm a hell of a woman
And for me it takes a hell of man
So don't you dare turn off the lights
Unless this you understand

Yes, my name is Shakespeare
A world class poet
So kick back and relax yourself baby
Let me pour you a glass of Moet
Darkness will be your blessing
As I bring you extreme delight
But first you must allow me, Shakespeare
To turn off the lights click

Don't turn off the lights
Unless you'll love me right
You hear what I'm saying
'Cause boy I'm not playing
Don't turn off the light
Unless you plan on staying

And of course, I'm DJ Yella
The mixologist of the crew
And I would just love
To mix bodies with you
Your lips I would kiss
Your body I would hold tight
But only if you allow me
Check this out
To turn off the lights

Like a male exotic dancer for you I'd dance
With nothing but a g-string on my hip
Your kiss and touch I'd slowly collect
For they'd be my tip
There's parts of your body I'd slowly kiss
And others I'd gently bite
But first, you must allow me, Lonzo

You hear the bass from the trunk when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off

They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

Still not loving police (Uh huh)

Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke till I sleep

Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust

Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions
Garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent!

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm King Kong
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want
Nigga on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherfucker I'm grown
I stunt I style I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want so what I trick
Fat ass burgundy bags classy shit Jimmy Choo shoes
I say move a bitch move

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle

Dr. Dre,"Good evening!
This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of four million and a half feet
That's eight million miles in the sky
Please, undo your seat belt for takeoff
You are now free to smoke about the cabin

I'm Dre from back in the day from
NWA from black and the gray from
Choking a bitch to smacking her face from
Stacking up bodies to
Racking their kegs up from
Racking a bitch to
Stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry
And I'm back with a tapeworm
And we was happening and rapping and tame at me
Shady for us competition
Faggot, there ain't none

Speak of the devil
It's attack of the rain man
Chainsaw in hand, blood stain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun run, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon?
No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon
A great one
Wait, the day ain't funny man
It's urgent
I need one
Two boxes of detergent and a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1

So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best (the best)
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best (the best)

Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless
A nice environment
Surprised, entirely hypnotized by the sound I surround the hydrants
Taking lives of firemen
Say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and Vicadin
Before I begin to get so high; pussy boy, I could spin
Fin, fin
Fuck the handle I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some French toast and show us some skin
I show you every inch grows of my foreskin
Show me nipple I pinch, throw up, and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse, if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain

So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best (the best)
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best (the best)

Now where there's smoke, there's fire
Where there's fire, there's flames
Where there's flames, there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games

Nah uh, he ain't playin'
He's gonna get the AK and aim it right at your brain
I'm slightly insane
Vodka and kreatine
Hypnotic and red bull
It's an incredible energy drink
And it's given me wings
I believe I can fly
While I pee on a girl
You won't catch me, CSI
It's as easy as pie
And as simple as cake
Dre, get on the mic and make them tremble and shake

Now put your smoke up in the air
And raise your henny and coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke till there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Lets get into it
You smoking with the triest and truest
I got the Midas touch
When it comes to rolling shit up
You motherfuckas ain't smoking
You just holding shit up
Now here we go
Let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
Cuz if at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing is how I blew up off of puffing them trees

Well puffing ain't enough for me
Fuck yeah, light it up Cheech, come on
Smoke me out, cuz
Give me contact buzz
Get me on track
They love me when I'm on that stuff
But this earth calling Shady, man come on back (what?)
Man we're losing him; he won't even respond back (fuck! )
Now look at all the pretty women in here
(Damn bitches)
Dre, it's hot
I think we better go check on their temperatures
I give them the thermometer
You get the bandages
Now baby just bend over
This won't hurt a damn bit,

And give me one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best (the best)
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best (the best)",Old Time's Sake,2009
Dr. Dre,"I want you, to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch I want the fans jumping
I want the fists, pumping in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't ya fill your cups
Shady's come to fill ya up, are you a D or a C cup?
You could even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the E.R., we are strapped with so much TNT
We may blow, no not even CPR from the EMT's
Could help you to resuscitate, you busters must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard, what's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
{*chka-chk-chk*} What's my name? Shady came and just crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them, cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear his skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
Cause this shit's getting embarrassing
The fog is thick and the air is thin
Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
La-didi-da-da-da-didi
He makes it look so easy, girl you just hit the lottery

Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell, breaks, loose
Try to restrain us you can't contain us, we're still gonna make a stink
No matter what, we, do
Everywhere we go it seems we're looking for any excuse
To just, cut, loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell, breaks, loose

This is when shit hits the fan, like it just splattered on Stan
This is the only moment that matters, your homie rolling with Mathers
Like chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say at once, this song's like a seance, it hums
(It makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance)
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off for what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smoking something
You think I ain't smoking nothing, stay off my nuts
Now hit the flo' baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose, loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah girl shake that caboose, I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose, a mongoose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose, me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves, and we came here to retract the roof
Yeah man ain't that the truth, girl your man's back in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch, and this is when all hell breaks loose

Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell, breaks, loose
Try to restrain us you can't contain us, we're still gonna make a stink
No matter what, we, do
Everywhere we go it seems we're looking for any excuse
To just, cut, loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell, breaks, loose

Now I know you're feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words
I'm mur-ur-during the flow, liquid courage I'm fin' to blow
As soon as we hit the do' power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit yo' ho
With speakers knocking it's 3 o'clock, me and Doc then proceed to drop
""E"" and hop out the vehicle and knock on your do'

Yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out you
Revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it freak, move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick
Right there that'll be pretty damn stupid of me
Born and raised in the C-P-T, yeah Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Them haters hating on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat, ""Dre fell off"", that's news to me

Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on

Coming up like a fat rat.
Big money, big cars, big body guards on his back.

But I got the hook up with somebody who knows how to get in contact with
him.

Hit him like this and like that,
Let 'em know that I'll make it for a big fat dope sack
What is this pen? so let's rush it.
If you want to handle it tonight we'll discuss it
On the nigga's time, in the nigga's place,

Crooked ass cops that be gettin' niggas a gang of times
And now they wanna make a deal with me
Scoop me up and put me on they team and chill with me
And make my pockets bigger
They want to meet with me tonight at 7 o'clock.

Six fo' five was the time on the clock,
When me and my homey bailed in the parking lot.
The scene looked strange and it felt like a set up.
Better not be, cause if it is, they're getting lit up.
Oh here they come from the back and they laxed.
I'm checkin' for the gats they strap, so whats up black?
Chill, lets hit a deal,
if it aint up to what you feel then grab your steel.
Right, so, what you motherfuckers gonna come at me with?
Hope you ain't wantin' none of my grip.
Cause you can save that shit.
Guess what they told me?
""We'll give you 20 G's if you snitch on your homey,
We'll put you in a home, and make your life plush,
Oh yeah, but you got to sell dope for us.""

In this corner, weighing a hundred and seventy five pounds,
With a record of seventeen rapes, four hundred a**aults, and four murders,

Slim Shady!

OK, let's go

Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed.
B****es lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cause when I spit the verse the s***
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.

I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that
Y'all starting to creep in, everyday its so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em

You picked me up, breath new life in me

Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and its almost like your begging for my help
Like I'm your leader
Your supposed to fucking be my mentor

You risked your career for me
I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy

You saved my life, now maybe its my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more

Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends
All I need is him
Fucking backstabbers
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath, fagots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass
Little crack a jack beat making wack ass backwards producers,
I'm back bastards

He said, ""Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse""
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Something told me, ""Try to fake a stomach ache, it works""
I screamed, ""Ow! My appendix feel like they could burst!
Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse!""
""What's the matter?"" ""I don't know, my leg, it hurts!""
""Leg?! I thought you said it was your tummy?""
""Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee!""
""Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework""
""But don't you want to give me after school detention?""
""Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'm a let him""

Way before my baby daughter Hailey
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
So everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him, ""We shouldn't beef""
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, ""You gonna die honky!""
The principal walked in and started helping him stomp me
I made them think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools
""This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back bully! Now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home later that same day
Started reading the comics, and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was trying to read
I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin', ""What are you on, drugs??
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug!"" (Stop!)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, ""Look bitch, what have you done?""
""Oh my God, I'm sorry son"" ""Shut up you cunt!""
I said, ""Fuck it!"" took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

I love bein hated, it great it
Let's me know that I made it
I wouldn't have it no other way
I wouldn't trade it for the world
Only let's me know that I'm loved
By so many other motherfuckers that ain't you
And as long, as you keep fuckin with us, we keep fuckin you up
And keep pullin the rug from up under you
And what's ever more fucked up, is we enjoy what were doin
So much there ain't nothin that we love more than +Pullin Your Skirts Up+
And exposin you hoes so much, people are startin to wonder
What's up with them fuckin one dough a man under-els
Do unto others of you will have done under you
So who the fuck you motherfuckers gonna run to
When someone runs up with a mask and puts a gun to you [gun cocks]
You will ask youself, how come your mans
Didn't enter that last round that he had in Curtis Jackson's ass while he had the chance
You keep askin us to keep it on wax but we can't
This is past any irrationalization
We have captured national media attention
Conversation is senseless, you can sense the tension start buildin
Soon as we enter the '106th & Park' building
Someone's gonna get killed and I swear to God
If someone so much as even touches one of my people
I'll put a million on his head
And you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it
But I'd rather rap than get into this gangsta shit
And it ain't because I'm a bitch
It's because I ain't a bitch, I don't endanger people that I'm with
I'm a general, I ain't Bush, I don't send my soldiers to war
I'm right there in the middle of the shit with 'em, so when I do get 'em
Orders to storm your headquarters, you'll be fuckin with a ..

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them bangin' Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthin' this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from

Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga

Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats

Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the East side
Know that's just how Compton roll

I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it

I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in)

Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine

So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby

Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine

Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA
America target our rap market, it's controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich, and the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers that know where you stay

Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit and start over from scratch and write new ones

That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, 'til my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride,
You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow
You'll never take my pride, killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent is getting no

That I intend to stop living
I won’t pretend
I’m good at forgiving
But I can’t hate you
Although I have tried
I, I, I

Like every other hour when I think about you
So now and then I drink about you
Trying to numb the pain with Juice and Gin
It’s like abuse, what’s the use of the bumps and bruises
If we moving towards a losing end
If I’m losing you then I refuse to win
Went from friendships with benefits
Funerals and your innocence
I can help you reminisce we in Madrid
On some double O 7 shit, we off the grid
Parting moments of pleasure, we never thought we’d ever
Suffer the consequences, the problem is
there’s a problem trying to kick this addiction
We probably can't resolve it without causing some friction
This is non-fiction, the definition of a true story
I’m like fuck pride baby that’s the kind of shit you do for me
Suicide it's a suicide, ready to die, you down to ride or what?

I won’t pretend
That I intend to stop living
I won’t pretend
That I’m good at forgiving
But I can’t hate you
Although I have tried

I still really really love you
My love is stronger than pride
I still really really love you

Sitting here wasting my time
Would be like
Waiting here for the sun to rise
It’s all too clear
Things come and go
Sitting here waiting for you
Would be like waiting for winter
It’s gonna be cold
There may even be snow

Goin' up, but shit, I feel the love
Spotlight on me and I'm feelin' so rare tonight
Actin' a fool and feelin' alive
I'm fuckin' flawless like I live in a vault
Only type of livin' I know

See if it was you you would've killed yourself by now
It takes a special kind of mothafucka to live like this
And they ask me how I do it
Mothafucka just take a look around

Best believe I'm in the buildin'
I hear you mothafuckas talkin' and all that but uh
No, no don't mention me at all
Yeah comin' live and direct
And I know you feelin' some type of way about it, but uh
Watch your mouth, I dare your ass to say somethin'
I thought it was all good
But now you mothafuckas crossed the line
Kinda pissin' me off
All the fans and all the fame, and though I gave everything to this game
They still complain
Now what the fuck do y'all expect me to do?
There's so much fuckin' pressure
It's so much pressure
And it's all in a day's work

Work, hard
Workin' so hard
24/7, 3-6-5
365, hard work
It's all in a day's work

My whole life all I ever thought about was grindin'
Even though my surroundings only showed me crime and violence
That was back when a rapper needed guns way more than a stylus
And that was back when I felt like rappers was true mothafuckin' riders
Or even back in the day when I was a fuckin' youngster man
Shit I was still sayin', ""Fuck the police""
Born and raised in the belly of the beast
I had a dream that we was at peace
But I was so wrong so wrong
Y'all too wrapped up in the bullshit and bias
Now reality TV talks about pulpits and choirs
Some of these hoes give less than a fuck when they runnin' their life story by us
It's the worst when I'm in a hotel, like a Hilton sick and tired
Some of these housewives way too fuckin' desperate
These bitches thinkin' fame first
I can't knock the hustle, it's all in a day's work
But that's that shit with potential to make the game worse
Shit it's just somethin' about that Hollywood curse
They just thirst

Hard times
I'm on my grind, fuck the part-time
Stay ready for war, I'm on the front line
I'm gettin' the feelin' like it's all mine
It's becoming the only feeling I know
Only type of livin' I know

Gonna go to work
We gotta work
Let's get back to work
On the grind, back to work

Let's work
Rich as fuck, but, guess what, I'm back to work
Overseas, back home, no time to sleep, I'm back to work
So many people that I love, they want my time but I got to work
Some of my friends don't understand, shit, I got to work
Always talkin' 'bout bustin' the club but I'm like, ""Fuck that I gotta work""

Maybe cause I'm a bastard
Or maybe cause of the way my hair grow naturally
Still tryna figure out, why the fuck I'm full of rage
I think I noticed this bullshit right around the fifth grade
Paraphernalia in my locker right next to the switch blade
Nothing but pussy on my mind and some plans of getting paid (Ay)
But I'm a product of the system raised on government aid
And I knew just how to react when it was time for that raid (whoa)
Just a young black man from Compton wondering who could save us
And could barely read the sentences the justice system gave us
So many rental cars with bricks, I think they probably funded Avis
Some of us was unbalanced but some us used our talents
Not all of us criminals but cops be yelling, ""Stay back nigga!""

You know how many nights I heard them sparks echo in the park?
Around this time I was spinnin' records at Eve After Dark
My CD crazy, school girls used to play with that chalk
Same chalk police used to outline niggas we lost
You understand what I'm sayin'? Shit is crazy, man
Fuck the money, yo this shit could never change me, man
These new niggas in this bitch could never phase me, man
I know it's strange but on some real shit it's plain as day
I’m just havin' some fuckin' fun with this rap shit

Man this industry to me, it feels a little plastic
I ain't heard nothin' that I can consider classic

Took that feeling to the studio and cued it up
And now it's ""Fuck the Police"" all up in the club
Now it's '91 and Snoop Dogg came to visit

Crips tryna get at me, my red Impala bumping like acne
My city a trap me
Been shot, robbed, stabbed, chased home, socked out
Jabbed by esse's, cops, degenerate niggas with rags
Disintegrate niggas went into me, dome shots like Kennedy
Slugs trippin' with Henessey, got murderous tendencies

They're drilling in this motherfucker

Crack fiends on the back streets
Where the tracks lean and the needles lay
And switchblades, if you bitch made
Put chili all on your Frito Lay's
Where we dream of Montego Bay
But all we got is the swap meet
Where the cops meet, go bang bang
Leaves blood stains on the concrete
And I'm the only nigga bumping Mobb Deep
Cause I mob deep down that side street
I'm a west side rider, [?] gats on collars
Don't hate me, better get your dollars
I be on Rosecrans with a Glock in both hands
Leaning on that bro hand
Flame dump like a co-tail with my name on it

Another day in Compton, the thrill is high
Know somebody's watching, but I don't know why
Feel the fire burning, it touches the sky

From that muthafuckin' legendary
From the city where the niggas load clips and fats
And get stabbed at home room should've skipped that class
Shit will never change on the West Side
Jack your shit, take your car for a test drive (Ah shit)
Gangbanin' out the window hollering let's ride
Gotta keep a tec by the bedside

All this pain and what I sacrificed
And all my niggas that lost their life, you never die, you never die
I'm in that motherfuckin' one for a minute now

Shut the fuck up, I'm the one that's killing now
Take a look who on top of the pinnacle

R.I.P to KMG
Still gotta murder rap, and don't give a fuck where the body at
You do too much talkin' I walk in the building I just give a fuck where the money at
They coaching the player
They trust me it's only just one of them
I'm callin' them shots and makin' the plays and if you get a train better fuck with him

Got me feelin' so anxious, I be lookin' so facetious
Feel like running a capre

Spent my birthday in Dubai
Skyrise surprise and I'm dressed like a spy
Black tux, oh you fucks guess what, I'm ready to blow

I hang that 6-2 sideways
Pissin' off the neighbors scrapin' bumpin' in the driveway
You gave me the pistol told me to kill at will

Blast it like a Kennedy beat
Wanna get rid of 'em? Send them to me

To stop these bitches niggas from runnin' their mouth

One on the dash, one in the stash, ready for danger

Probably reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf

And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone

And fucking goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls

And I roll a sticky on my bitch back while I hit it,
I done been there, done that, had beefs and won that,
5 million records on 1 plaque I hung that,
Still got Dr. Dre low ridin' in the 64',

My lil' hood rat, baby got that mini mack,
Baby got that 20 sack, baby got plenty that,
Whatever you send it's my nugga, we gonna send it back
I'm in the club, with the snub, getting' love,
With 20 thousand Crips and 20 thousand Bloods,
And we don't give a fuck about none of ya'll,
And when you hit the city, you better holla at the Big Dogg,
I done seen niggas hit LA and get dey chain snatched,
Then they call me up, beggin' me to get dey chain back,
What I look like the mudafukin Police,
It's certain rules you got to follow, when you in these streets,
Especially when it comes to this Cali shit,
And I ain't talkin' bout hangin' in the valley Bitch,
Gang bang niggas all up in the alley Crip,
On some real talk nigga we the real Westcoast.

Damn, I heard blue rag niggas ain't fucking with the red rag niggas,
On the Westcoast (Fuck you mean),

Black wallstreet and X-o-leen,

Violence breeds enemies more permanent silence,

My mama house was in the middle of the street
How was a nigga supposed to get to school
I hopped every backyard on my block
'Till I got to Elm Street, took the rag out my sock
And I could have been a Crip but I ain't like blue that much
All Crip school, I ain't really go to school that much
I was selling crack on Elm, bagging up sacks on Elm
With the ratchet in my boogie jacket giving you the facts on Elm
King frog and big face they had my back on Elm
We was fighting over territory with the T Flats on Elm
I had to scrap on Elm, that's how I got my stripes
Air Max 95s not a scratch on my Nikes
2016 motherfucker don't you pull it
'Cause I made it out of Compton with a stab wound and five bullets

Don't trip on me, don't trip on me, nigga don't trip

'Cause I'm bool like that, I'm bool like that
I'm bool like that, yeah I'm bool like that
They say ""Game, why you always act a fool like that?""
'Cause I went to Compton High Crip School like that
I was Blood and I ain't really like blue like that
They was Crippin they ain't give a fuck who like that
Them niggas jumped me why they have to do a 'ru like that

We trip like that cause LA sick like that

Still, still doing that shit, huh Dre?

Oh for sure, check me out
It's still Dre Day, A.K. nigga
Before I chrome the lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the trunk when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga my last album was ""The Chronic""
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

If you ain't up on pace

Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still with the beats
Still not loving police (Uh huh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets, repping 213
Still the beat bangs, still doing my thang
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still

[Chorus]

I'm representing for the gangsters all across the world
Still hitting them corners in them low low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E [Repeat 2x]

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life is like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke till I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire till you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the troop
It's ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, After-mathematic
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangsters all across the world
(Still hitting them corners in them low low's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back

So if you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gonna get mine regardless

[Chorus]

Right back up in ya muthfuckin ass
'95 plus four pennies
Add that shit up, D-R-E right back on top of thangs

Walking home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and grandpa we believe
She'd been drinking too much eggnog
And we begged her not to go
But she forgot her medication, and she
Staggered out the door into the snow
When we found her Christmas morning
At the scene of the attack
She had hoof-prints on her forehead
And incriminating Claus marks on her back

Now we're all so proud of grandpa
He's been taking this so well
See him in there watching football
Drinking root beer and
Playing cards with Cousin Mel
It's not Christmas without Grandma
All the family's dressed in black
And we just can't help but wonder
Should we open up her gifts
Or send them back?
Send them back

Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig
And the blue and silver candles
That would just have matched
The hair on grandma's wig

Dr. Feelgood,"Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans,
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood,
Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well,
But he could play the guitar like ringing a bell.
Go Go, Go Johnny Go, Go, Go Johnny Go
Go, Go Johnny Go Go, Go Johnny Go
Go, Johnny B. Goode

He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
[Well] sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.
Oh, the engineers used to see him sitting in the shade,
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made.
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my but that little country boy could play
Go Go, Go Johnny Go, Go, Go Johnny Go
Go, Go Johnny Go Go, Go Johnny Go
Go, Johnny B. Goode

His mother told him someday you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big old band.
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight.
Go Go, Go Johnny Go",Johnny B Goode,1976
Dr. Feelgood,"Baby Jane, what a fool I've been.
I let you go; I cast my fate to the four winds.
Baby Jane, can you forgive me now,
And take away this heart of pain
That I'm living, girl?

All that good, sweet, loving.
I guess you forgot.
All that good, sweet, hugging.
When I lost you I sure lost a lot.

Baby Jane, what a fool I've been.
I let you go; I cast my fate to the four winds.

Dr. Feelgood,"Sitting in a downtown discotheque
Saw a cute little girl that stole my breath away
Line of guys that had the eyes on her
To my surprise she said 'I beg you Sir'
I stay
I thought I had it made
Sat at a table for a couple of drinks
Moving closer and she kissed my neck

That's when I knew that I was in with a chance
Records were a playing and she asked for a dance
They played
I thought I had it made

We were a swinging to the moody blues
Looked into my eyes I thought I blew a fuse
Music stopped playing the lights went out
Dropped my drink when I heard them shout
It's a raid
I thought I had it made
Hey everybody take a look at me
Didn't come to until a quarter past three

Got no money couldn't put up the bail

 Why must she be such a dog gone tease
 There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
 We meet the gang and go to Rockin' Joe's
 The cats are stomping on their heels and toes
 I grab my baby try and give her a squeeze

 I keep trying hard to make her mine
 Some day the wind will blow the sun will shine
 Until the time she puts my heart at ease

Dr. Feelgood,"Went out walking I recall
Me and my best girl along the wall
In the long grass side by side
Where the big ships go gliding by, go gliding by
Skylark singing in the sun
Something told me she's the one
When I looked down into her eyes
I saw pictures of paradise, of paradise, of paradise
Every night you look so mean
Staring at your TV Screen
Back when we where seventeen
You turned me around Irene Irene
When the days got colder time went by
Dark cloud rising into the sky
I just sat there gazing on
Like a tower of Babylon, of Babylon
I went wandering far from home
Left my good girl all on her own
I went back there she got the power
See me through my darkest hour, my darkest hour, my darkest hour
Every night you look so mean
Staring at your TV Screen
I got lost inside a dream
You brought me back Irene Irene
People talking but they don't know
Where I've been to or where I'll go
World keep turning all things change
I love two girls I ain't ashamed, I ain't ashamed
All your loving it thrills me so
I can't go with you I just can't go
A thousand highways you don't live twice
Only one road to paradise, to paradise, to paradise

Staring at your TV screen
Thinkin' about what might have been
I'll love you still Irene Irene",Paradise,1977

Starin' out of the night
You got so many troubles
Of a nervous mind
But don't worry baby
It's gonna work out fine
You hear the sound of footsteps
Steal across the floor
You pick the receiver
You don't know what for
Then you saw a shadow
Steppin' through the door
Why don't worry baby
What the world may bring
Why don't worry baby
It won't change a thing
Cause life is a fight
And then you die
Standin' there by the window
Starin' out of the night
See your lover leaning
Against the old street light
It's gonna be alright
He was a tossin' and turnin'
And he just couldn't sleep
Said you shouldn't bother
It was just a dream
So where was he goin'
Headin' down the street

Why don't worry baby
It won't change a thing

I spit on thrash that I pass en route
I pay each fine with a mental note
I sign no line and decline to vote

I've searched for clues caught 'em in the act

I'll get through without you.

Go your own way, don't think twice about me.
'Cause I've got ideas and plans of my own.
So long darling, I'll miss you, believe me.

They are very faint
And the pollution in earths atmosphere

washes out their pale light




Floating without air, without light
Or else - charred on the re-entry

They are still out there floating


Within the orbit of Mars.


Look at it this way:

a river of space, a ribbon of time

like a burial by a beaurocrat

undercover of a cold war risk.

a cloud of dust-a cloud of rubble

spinning in space on the heels of the Hubble

a parallel, or a temporal rip

in the belly of the Cosmos

a fossilized finger
Somewhere in a hanger


Stored by the government, hidden from the press

some young top gun s first solo

turned out to be a N.E.O.

get with the boogie and

sound waves in the rave - my body sways -


My brain is opening


Deejay bomb the bass
My thoughts erase my body s booming and

feet feet feel the beat

make my own heat

move your body to the beat boy

slide your body next to me

and feel the rhythm

Holding my beer glass too tight

But that sure didn't seem to matter

And she smiled and looked at me a little sideways
I said ""Come on jump inside, we'll take a little ride""

And she said ""Awright little man, let's go to my place""

I used to be a prancer a one-eyed song and dancer
But eyes for true romance I didn't even try
I'd get 'em and forget 'em
But I never could stay with 'em
'Cause I thought my well of love had done run dry

But now it's bubblin' up
I feel it bubblin' up
And you can't hold down this true love
No matter what you do
Because it's bubblin' up
(you can hear it baby)
It's bubblin' up
And it'll soon be bubblin' over just for you
(Get that look off your face!)

I knew that when I met you
You love me and I let you
But I'd gladly bet you that it wouldn't last too long
But I had no way of knowing that this thing would keep on growin'
And now the feeling still is going strong

And yes it's bubblin' up
It's bubble ubblin' up
And you can't hold down this true love
No matter what you do
Because it's bubblin' up

You better watch out or they're gonna get you too
They'll clip your claws, cut your hair, make a pussy cat out of you

You bet look out for all the hidden traps
They'll feed you sweets and goodies 'til you're too fat to move

And ask the band to play us Auld Lang Syne

Were just too steep for me to climb
And I guess these dirty streets of mine
Were just too rough for you

Dr. Hook,"Lately, I've been givin' everything I've got to feeling alone
Baby you got me livin' one of them hard luck songs on the radio
Oh and I know, if I change the station I'll get the same song
Hope it ain't on the top too long

'Cause I really couldn't take it but they kept on playin' it
It's too unhappy and too close to home
I don't want to hear it but the singer keeps singin' that song

I gave you my love, you denied it
Then I gave you my life, but you wouldn't stay
And I hope you will return it to me someday
I gave you my love, you denied it
Then I gave you my life but you threw it away
And I hope you will return it to me someday

Some days I just sit around and kind of dream and watch the rain
Or I'll pick up some ol' magazine of yours that I forgot to throw away
Then I'll sleep a little or walk the floor, I'll smoke a lot more than I did before
I'll call somebody I used to know, just to try to stay away from that radio

'Cause I really can't take it when they keep on playin' it
It's so unhappy and so close to home

Dr. Hook,"(J. Comanor/S. Silverstein)

Sal from the valley loved Al from the alley and they lived in harmony
Sally played acoustic and Al, he played electric and they both took turns on lead
They sang it for their friends, again and again of the places they had been
But their favourite song of all was called up on the mountain

Up on the mountain, up where the light breaks, that's where you'll find me
Gonna leave this worrisome world and it's trouble behind me
Up on the mountain, where the light breaks, that's where I'll be
I've barely got time to finish this song so say farewell for me

Then into the valley came a girl from the galleys, with a strange and smilin' face
Al played acoustic and Sally played electric, and the gal played a hell of a bass
And when they sang their harmonies, the lady dipped right in
She soon moved in and lived with them up on the mountain

Up on the mountain, up where the light breaks, that's where you'll find me
Gonna leave this worrisome world and it's trouble behind me
Up on the mountain, where the light breaks, that's where I'll be
I've barely got time to finish this song so say farewell for me

Now Al from the alley is gone from the valley, a sadder but wiser man
And Sally from the valley and the gal from the galleys they live in mortal sin
Sal plays acoustic and the gal plays electric and sometimes they hold hands
Late at night you can hear them playing, up on the mountain

Up on the mountain, up where the light breaks, that's where you'll find me
Gonna leave this worrisome world and it's trouble behind me
Up on the mountain, where the light breaks, that's where I'll be
I've barely got time to finish this song so say farewell for me

Hot lickin' and finger pickin'
Say farewell for me

Gotta help him build an ol' chicken coop, gotta help him paint the barn

When you're caught in the middle you can bet your life that it'll be

You gotta hang on very tight to the things you know are right, let the fly-by-night things be
When the Devil calls your name and he says he won the game, and you know there ain't no turning back
When he says you're gonna die, you just spit right in his eye, and don't let the loose end drag

Turning, moving back and forth, they were lovers
One more lonely night for me
I looked up, what did I see?

Sexy eyes moving 'cross the floor
Got me wanting more sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, gettin' down with you
I wanna move with you sexy eyes

I got up and took your hand
And we both began to dance to the music
Ooh, your magic cast a spell
It didn't take long till we fell and we knew it
No more lonely nights for me

Dr. Hook,"Sleeping late, sleeping late

Whenever I sleep late you know I can dream
Some of the strangest things that you've ever seen
I could never tell you the things that I do in my head
Leaving nothing unsaid, sleeping late in my bed

Sleeping late, sleeping late

Sometimes I'm embarrassed by devious thoughts
When I'm undercover let me never get caught
Crazy notions begin with that old devil grin on my face
We're such a disgrace, me and my pillow-case

Sleeping late, sleeping late
Sleeping late, sleeping late

The blissful state of sleeping late has been known to compensate
And sometimes even stimulate
I for one appreciate, sleeping late
Ain't it great sleeping late

Sleeping late, sleeping late

Live and in colour, my wildest of dreams
The best ones are re-runs if you know what I mean
I don't believe I can wait for that clock to stop ringing in my ear
It's so lovely here, I may sleep for a year

Telling lies in the Blue Moon Bar
His face was hard and travelled, and as the wine unravelled
I saw a man who could laugh about his scars

I got hog-tied by a hustler in Ohio
I got derailed by a dancer down in Dallas
Oh Lord, he said, women gonna be the death of me but what a way to go

He said a girl named Nancy, once tickled his fancy
And backed it up with a fifty dollar smile
He laughed when he remembered, the pain of sweet surrender
But heartaches never seemed to cramp his style

I got french-fried by a waitress in Idaho
I got way-laid by a widow in Wyoming

Help me mama she's touching my heart
And I just can't keep her away
Stop her mama I can't let it start
Mama please make her go away

Stop her mama, she's starting to speak
I'm afraid she might talk me away
Help me mama, I'm getting weak
'Cause I've been through this before and I can't take anymore
Mama please make her go away

Mama, she's getting so close I'm afraid
Mama she's got me feeling that same old way

Though we tried

Before the tears, I'm leaving
Should've left a long time ago
'Cause it's clear we stopped believing anymore
And I'm so tired and empty
Since I found we've lost it all
And I'm leaving before the tears start to fall

Ooh I'm leaving before the tears start to fall

Sad to say
I'm on my way
And your heart will be breaking at dawn
I'll be gone

Searching for the love I miss, you once gave to me
She is warm here by my side, I should be satisfied
It's sad to realise I'm still in love with you

'Cause I'm chained to your memory
Tied and bound, I can't get free
There's got to be another love for me
There's got to be someone to set me free

She holds me close to her, I love the sweet things she whispers
But only my memory stirs, my heart still isn't free

Let's talk about hearts, no two are the same
Some of them are cold as ice, others need the flame
One of them gets comfortable, the other needs a change

But hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

Some hearts break too easily, some are hard as stone
One heart cries for company, the other cries alone
Other loves can walk away, but still our hearts remain

'Cause hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

There's pleasure in the pain, sunlight through the rain, daylight through the dark
And 'though we know the hurt, we know how much it's worth to stay here where we are

The waitress with the orange hair keeps motionin' me to hurry up and leave
So I gulp my coffee - burn my mouth - grab up my coat and slippin' out
I smear a streak of mustard down my sleeve
And the guy behind the register takes my bread and shakes his head
And looks at me as though I've blown his mind
Hey, I just come here for some coffeeâ?¦hope I'm not wastin' anybody's time

And Judy I'm slowly movin' back to you
And I wish that I could say I'll treat you better than I used to
It's just I'm learnin' lots of things I never knew back then
Judy I'm slowly movin' back again
Judy I'm slowly movin' back again

That blue eyed barracuda smiles and tells me she could use some brand new clothes
She grabs my leg and with a wink, asks if I want another drink
She's not the campfire girl you might suppose
But she's so busy tellin' me her troubles I don't think she's got time
For any kind of trouble small as mine
Hey, I just come in here for nothin'â?¦ hope I'm not wastin' anybody's time

And Judy I'm slowly movin' back to you
And I wish that I could say I'll treat you better than I used to
It's just I'm learnin' lots of things I never knew back then
Judy I'm slowly movin' back again
Judy I'm slowly movin' back again

Well I'm stopped here on the corner, when the red faced cop says move along your way
But my nose is cold and my toes are numb, I got no feeling in my thumb
I think I just might stop inside that church and maybe pray
But they pass the plate and they look at me when it turns out that I ain't got a dime
Hey, I just come in here to talk to GODâ?¦ hope I'm not wastin' anybody's time

And Judy I'm slowly movin' back to you
And I wish that I could say I'll treat you better than I used to
It's just I'm learnin' lots of things I never knew back then

Penicillin Penny she's the queen of the sunset strip
If she ever gives you any then you better see your doctor real quick
From the back seat of Cadillac cars, to the floor of men's room bars
She's Penicillin Penny and her future's written in the stars

She's Penicillin Penny and ever since the day she came and came
They say she's had so many, she gives 'em all numbers not names
I always call her Hun' but she calls me 1001
And Penicillin Penny starts to boogie when the day is done

She's Penicillin Penny and if you ever see her passin' through
Better run into your house before she stops and lays a little on you
If you ever let her in your door it takes 20 million units
Or more to cure the love that Penicillin Penny's gonna lay on you

And any time I needed you, you cure'd my misery

And all you do is lay around on your ass and cry
Baby if you don't wanna see me die

She'd snuggle up and talk to me
Each night as I'd watch TV
I'd teasingly call her chatter-box
Then one night she said ""Don't be scared,
I see an angel on the stairs
Daddy can you hear the angel talk?""

One more year of lollipops, ice-cream cones and soda pop
One more year of Daddy's little girl
One more year of cracker jacks, bubble gum and sugar smacks
One more year of Daddy's little girl

I took her in my arms upstairs
And as she said her night-time prayers
I felt a fever burning in her head
She gave thanks for Mum and me
And said, ""I heard my angel speak
Daddy this is what my angel said

One more year of lollipops, ice-cream cones and soda pop
One more year of Daddy's little girl
One more year of cracker jacks, bubble gum and sugar smacks
One more year of Daddy's little girl

Her faith grew strong, her body weak
And soon my frightened eyes could see
There was nothing on Earth that I could do
And one year later, to the day
In her sleep, she slipped away
And I knew what she'd said and heard was true

One more year of lollipops, ice-cream cones and soda pop
One more year of Daddy's little girl
One more year of cracker jacks, bubble gum and sugar smacks
One more year of Daddy's little girl

Grab your hats and swing your hips
And don't forget to bring your whips

Roll up something to take along

All the straights, swingin' with the funkies

Naked on your big white horse
With your long hair hangin' down
Lady Godiva, you say you're frightened
And so shy
I hate to bust your bubble but you
Sure picked a funny place to hide

Hey Lady Godiva, lookin' for a place
Where no one wants your body
And nobody knows your face
Lady Godiva, you say you wanna be loved
For what's inside
I donÂ't know much about horses but you
Sure picked a funny place to ride

Every man's just a clutchin' hand
Reachin' out to grab you
Every man's a quiverin' lance
Tryin' hard to stab you - don' let 'em nab you

Hey Lady Godiva, lookin' kind of scared
You showed 'em all your talents
And nobody seems to care

Come to think it over
You may have picked the perfect place to hide

If I'd only come and gone
The way I've always done with summer girls before
Shared one night with you and never reached for more
Then we wouldn't face this long and painful righting of the wrong
If I'd just come and gone

If I hadn't stayed so long
And merely parked my dusty boots outside your door
Tracked no footprints 'cross your polished hardwood floor
If I'd have left you in your doorway smilin' drowsily at the dawn
If I'd just come and gone

Then I'd be on a shinin' silver plane dippin' into Denver
Or a schooner blowin' down The Biscayne Bay
You'd be safely tucked away among the pleasure I'd remember
'Stead of lyin' here beside me fearin' restless thoughts inside me
That might awaken with the breakin' of each new day

If you'd only stopped to read
Cold hard words I carved on other bedroom walls
And heard the mornin' coffee truths I told 'em all
I'd still be on your lips like some unfinished half-remembered song
You'd never have loved me if I'd just come and gone

If I'd only come and gone

I'm gonna throw my grass out the window
Crumple up my papers too
Give away my speed, Cause all I'm gonna need
Is just a little bit of love from you

And we'll be makin' it natural
Ain't it just about time
That old stuff I was so keen on
I no longer have to lean on
Cause your love's enough to keep me high

Now if any you heads want some Panama red
All you gotta do is to reach out your hand
I'll trade my stash for just a little bit of cash
To buy a simple golden wedding band

And we'll be makin' it natural
But don't you ask me how
It's been the cause of all my sorrow
But I think I'll start tomorrow
'Cause I sure could use a hit right now

I'm gonna throw it out the window, some day
Give away my cocaine
Bust my spikes and flush a million mikes
Of acid right down the drain
And we'll be makin' it natural, makin' it natural.......

But all I do is listen to the things I didn't say

I didn't say ""Take off your coat, I'll make some coffee and a talk""
I didn't say ""The motorway is such a long and lonely, endless walk""

",The Things I Didn't Say,2001

In her white suburban bedroom, in a white suburban town
As she lay there 'neath the covers, dreaming of a thousand lovers
'Til the world turned to orange and the room went spinnin' round

At the age of 37, she realized she'd never ride through Paris
In a sports car, with the warm wind in her hair
And she let the phone keep ringin' as she sat there softly singin'
Pretty nursery rhymes she'd memorized in her daddy's easy chair

Her husband, he was off to work, and the kids were off to school
And there were oh so many ways for her to spend her day
She could clean the house for hours, or rearrange the flowers
Or run naked down the shady street screaming all the way

At the age of 37, she realized she'd never ride through Paris
In a sports car, with the warm wind in her hair
And she let that phone keep ringin' as she sat there softly singin'
Pretty nursery rhymes she'd memorized in her daddy's easy chair

The evening sun touched gently on the eyes of Lucy Jordan
On the rooftop where she'd climbed when all the laughter grew too loud
And she bowed and curtsy to the man, who reached and offered her his hand
And led her down to the long white car that waited past the crowd

At the age of 37, she knew she'd found forever as they rode along through Paris
With the warm wind in her hair

Then I heard the words that he was sayin'

He said

And staggered down the street
To the window of a five and dime

And then I heard him shoutin'

He could surely climb
If she was only there 
To point, the right direction

And I remember her on the streets of New York City
As I walked the night needing some place warm to go
As she passed I said ""Hey there's snowflakes on your lashes""
And she laughed and said, ""That isn't snow""

She said, ""they're feathers from a pillow God is shaking in the sky""
And she opened smiling lips to catch a snowflake blowing by
And we both began to laugh and then I looked into her eyes
And it was warm again

But
I never got to know her very well
All we did was spend a little time
You're waiting for a story but there's really none to tell
She's just a passing shadow on my mind

But I remember her as we woke up warm together
In her sunlit room, and she said, ""I'll help you pack""
And she sewed my shirt and I said, ""I'll stay forever""
But she laughed and put some cookies in my sack

And she said ""Leave a trail of cookie crumbs as you walk through the snow
And someday I'll follow after and I'll find you where you go""
And I left her in her doorway but why I'll never know
But I was younger then

So
I never got to know her very well
All we did was spend a little time
You're waiting for a story but there's really none to tell
She's just a passing shadow on my mind

Furs that are woven of whispering hours
Gone, gone, gone, gone

And she's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Whispering hours where do they fly away?

That years will crumble all castles of sand
And the flowers and grass turn brown in our hands

I swear you could taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone
But it really wasn't nothing but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful, wonderful soupstone

Hanging from a string in my mama's kitchen, back in the hard time days
Was a little ol' stone 'bout the size of an apple, it was smooth and worn and grey
There wasn't much food in my mama's kitchen, so whenever things got tight
Mama boiled up some water, put in the stone and said ""Let's have some soup tonight""

And I swear you could taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone
But it really wasn't nothing but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful, wonderful soupstone

It had been in the family for a whole lotta years, so we knew it was a nourishing thing
And I remember mama, as she stirred it in the water, and we could all hear her sing
""Its a magical stone and as long as we got it, we'll never have a hungry night
Just add a little love to the wonderful soupstone and everything will be alright""

And I swear you could taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone
But it really wasn't nothing but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful, wonderful soupstone

So it carried us all through the darkening days, 'til finally the sunshine came
And the soupstone started into gathering dust, but it hung there just the same
And ever since then the food's been plenty, but every now and then I find
That mama in the kitchen with the wonderful soupstone, drifts across my mind

And again I can taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone
But it really wasn't nothing but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful, wonderful soupstone

And again I can taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone
But it really wasn't nothing but some water and potatoes

Dr. Hook,"The traffic at this hour is so thick that he's afraid he might be late
Her flight arrives at seven ten and he remembers
How the lady hates to wait and he remembers losing her
And begging her to give him time to change

Now his mind is numb 'cause the time has come
His final chance is coming in on that plane

She fastens up her seat belt
And nervously she finishes her drink
An all night flight from L.A. can give a woman
A little bit too much time to think

And she hopes deep in her heart
That he'll be different but she knows he'll be the same
And she wonders if the stewardess would be
Kind enough to just let her stay on that plane

That plane settling in to the heavy city haze
Where she remembers guilty nights and baby please forgive me days
As she slowly unfastens her belt and he clutches the wheel
That plane screaming as loud as the pain that they both feel

He's one mile from the airport
Damn traffic's backed up all along the lane
She waits five minutes takes a breath
And turns around and gets back on the aeroplane

She'll ride it through to Denver
She's got friends there, they could spend a little time
'Cause she knew he'd never be there
And he knows she never was the waiting kind

That plane rising up into the heavy city haze
Where she remembers guilty nights and baby please forgive me days
That plane screaming as loud as the pain that they both feel
As she slowly unfastens her belt and he clutches the wheel

I was sitting in my basement I just rolled myself a taste
Of something green and gold and glorious to get me through the day
Then my friend yelled through the transom ""Grab your coat and get your hat son
There's a nut down on the corner, givin' dollar bills away""

But I laid around a bit
Then I had another hit
Then I rolled myself a bauma
Then I thought about my mama
Then I fooled around, played around
Jacked around a while and then

I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and it rolled right by
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned oh me oh my

Now it took seven months of urging just to get that local virgin
With the sweet face up to my place to fool around a bit
Next day she woke up rosy and she snuggled up so cosy
When she asked me how I liked it Lord it hurt me to admit

I was stoned and I missed it
I was stoned and I missed it
I was stoned and it rolled right by
I was stoned and I missed it
I was stoned and I missed it
I was stoned oh me oh my

Now I ain't makin' no excuses for the many things I uses
Just to sweeten my relationships and brighten up my day
But when my earthly race is over and I'm ready for the clover
And they ask me how my life has been I guess I'll have to say

I was stoned and I missed it
I was stoned and I missed it
I was stoned and it rolled right by
I was stoned and I missed it
I was stoned and I missed it
I was stoned oh me oh my

Serve it to me in bed go on the street and hustle bring me back all the money you make
Won't you rub my body with sweet scented oil, cool me with a 'lectric fan
Run to the church fall down on your knees say Lord I wanna thank you for that man

And I'll call that true love, true and sweet
That ain't the kind of love I'm gettin'
But baby that's the kind of love I need

I wanna come home every evenin' to a great big meal of wine and roasted pheasant
I want you to say to me Ray, hey this is Susy, this is Kay, I brought 'em both home to you for a present
When The Man downs his soul and find my stash, won't you tell 'em it belongs to you
And when you're sittin' in the slam tell all the other chickies when they get out they should look me up too

And I'll call that true love, true and sweet
That ain't the kind of love I'm gettin'
But baby that's the kind of love I need

Points a gun at me, I want you to jump in the middle and take the bullet in your own heart
And as you're lyin' on the floor and dyin', I want you to look up at me and say
Hey Ray I'm sorry I messed up your rug, just roll my body out of the way

And I'll call that true love, true and sweet

But baby that's the kind of love I need

And when we're ballin' baby, ride on top so I never ever strain my heart

So I gulp my coffee - burn my mouth - grab up my coat and slippin' out
I smear a streak of mustard down my sleeve
And the guy behind the register takes my bread and shakes his head
And looks at me as though I've blown his mind
Hey, I just come here for some coffeeâ?¦hope I'm not wastin' anybody's time

And Judy I'm slowly movin' back to you
And I wish that I could say I'll treat you better than I used to
It's just I'm learnin' lots of things I never knew back then
Judy I'm slowly movin' back again

That blue eyed barracuda smiles and tells me she could use some brand new clothes
She grabs my leg and with a wink, asks if I want another drink
She's not the campfire girl you might suppose
But she's so busy tellin' me her troubles I don't think she's got time
For any kind of trouble small as mine
Hey, I just come in here for nothin'â?¦ hope I'm not wastin' anybody's time

And I wish that I could say I'll treat you better than I used to

Judy I'm slowly movin' back again

Well I'm stopped here on the corner, when the red faced cop says move along your way
But my nose is cold and my toes are numb, I got no feeling in my thumb
I think I just might stop inside that church and maybe pray
But they pass the plate and they look at me when it turns out that I ain't got a dime
Hey, I just come in here to talk to GODâ?¦ hope I'm not wastin' anybody's time

And Judy I'm slowly movin' back to you

But you say it with a wistful smile like you already knew

I used to be a prancer a one-eyed song and dancer
But eyes for true romance I didn't even try
I'd get 'em and forget 'em
But I never could stay with 'em
'Cause I thought my well of love had done run dry

But now it's bubblin' up
I feel it bubblin' up
And you can't hold down this true love
No matter what you do
Because it's bubblin' up
(you can hear it baby)
It's bubblin' up
And it'll soon be bubblin' over just for you
(Get that look off your face!)

I knew that when I met you
You love me and I let you
But I'd gladly bet you that it wouldn't last too long
But I had no way of knowing that this thing would keep on growin'
And now the feeling still is going strong

And yes it's bubblin' up
It's bubble ubblin' up
And you can't hold down this true love
No matter what you do

In her white suburban bedroom, in a white suburban town
As she lay there 'neath the covers, dreaming of a thousand lovers
'Til the world turned to orange and the room went spinnin' round

At the age of 37, she realized she'd never ride through Paris
In a sports car, with the warm wind in her hair
And she let the phone keep ringin' as she sat there softly singin'
Pretty nursery rhymes she'd memorized in her daddy's easy chair

Her husband, he was off to work, and the kids were off to school
And there were oh so many ways for her to spend her day
She could clean the house for hours, or rearrange the flowers
Or run naked down the shady street screaming all the way

In a sports car, with the warm wind in her hair

The evening sun touched gently on the eyes of Lucy Jordan
On the rooftop where she'd climbed when all the laughter grew too loud
And she bowed and curtsy to the man, who reached and offered her his hand
And led her down to the long white car that waited past the crowd

It was bumper next to bumper on the highway
Sittin' jammed up tight, looked over to my right
There was a hitchhikin' honey goin' my way

And she smiled, and looked at me a little sideways
I said, ""Come on, jump inside, we'll take a little ride.""
And she said, ""Alright, little man, let's go to my place.""

Where no one wants your body
And nobody knows your face

Shared one night with you and never reached for more
Then we wouldn't face this long and painful righting of the wrong

If I hadn't stayed so long
And merely parked my dusty boots outside your door
Tracked no footprints 'cross your polished hardwood floor
If I'd have left you in your doorway smilin' drowsily at the dawn
If I'd just come and gone

Then I'd be on a shinin' silver plane dippin' into Denver
Or a schooner blowin' down The Biscayne Bay
You'd be safely tucked away among the pleasure I'd remember
'Stead of lyin' here beside me fearin' restless thoughts inside me
That might awaken with the breakin' of each new day

If you'd only stopped to read
Cold hard words I carved on other bedroom walls
And heard the mornin' coffee truths I told 'em all

I'm gonna throw my grass out the window
Crumple up my papers too
Give away my speed, Cause all I'm gonna need
Is just a little bit of love from you

And we'll be makin' it natural
Ain't it just about time
That old stuff I was so keen on
I no longer have to lean on
Cause your love's enough to keep me high

Now if any you heads want some Panama red
All you gotta do is to reach out your hand
I'll trade my stash for just a little bit of cash
To buy a simple golden wedding band

And we'll be makin' it natural
But don't you ask me how
It's been the cause of all my sorrow
But I think I'll start tomorrow
'Cause I sure could use a hit right now

I'm gonna throw it out the window, some day
Give away my cocaine
Bust my spikes and flush a million mikes
Of acid right down the drain
And we'll be makin' it natural, makin' it natural.......

Monterey Jack woke up in his shack on a Monday
Monterey Jack had a little bitty snack of some elderberry wine
Monterey Jack walked down the track, all the way to ol' Harley's shack
Stuck his knife in ol' Harley's back
And they say that's the way ol' Harley Davison died

1...2...3...4...

Ol' Jack Hoff was gettin' off in a doorway
Ol' Jack Hoff was gettin' off with little Sarah Lee
Ol' Jack Hoff was gettin' off when he mumbled and stumbled and started to cough
And his vein went hard and he went soft
And they say that's the way how ol' Jack Hoff O.G.'d

Spoken:
You mean O.D.
No.... O.G.
Oh man what's that?
That's when you O.D and you say Oh Gee!

Tom McCann looked into his hand and found a jelly-roll
Tom McCann was feelin' grand, all the girls were lickin' his hand

No it ain't either, here it is again

Penicillin Penny she's the queen of the sunset strip
If she ever gives you any then you better see your doctor real quick
From the back seat of Cadillac cars, to the floor of men's room bars
She's Penicillin Penny and her future's written in the stars

She's Penicillin Penny and ever since the day she came and came
They say she's had so many, she gives 'em all numbers not names
I always call her Hun' but she calls me 1001
And Penicillin Penny starts to boogie when the day is done

She's Penicillin Penny and if you ever see her passin' through
Better run into your house before she stops and lays a little on you
If you ever let her in your door it takes 20 million units
Or more to cure the love that Penicillin Penny's gonna lay on you

Down the road to where it's at I must have lost my way
When I got there they said I was too late
Now you're the only one can get me straight

Just tonight make it right 'cause it's been wrong for oh so long
There's lots of shades of darkness, Josie deep inside a man
So sing me a rainbow if you can

The train I went to meet had come and gone
Seems like I spend all my time gettin' off and gettin' on
I sold my mind and gave my dreams away
And tomorrow I'll start lookin' 'round for yesterday

I swear you could taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone
But it really wasn't nothing but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful, wonderful soupstone

Hanging from a string in my mama's kitchen, back in the hard time days
Was a little ol' stone 'bout the size of an apple, it was smooth and worn and grey
There wasn't much food in my mama's kitchen, so whenever things got tight
Mama boiled up some water, put in the stone and said ""Let's have some soup tonight""

And I swear you could taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone
But it really wasn't nothing but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful, wonderful soupstone

It had been in the family for a whole lotta years, so we knew it was a nourishing thing
And I remember mama, as she stirred it in the water, and we could all hear her sing
""Its a magical stone and as long as we got it, we'll never have a hungry night
Just add a little love to the wonderful soupstone and everything will be alright""

And I swear you could taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone
But it really wasn't nothing but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful, wonderful soupstone

So it carried us all through the darkening days, 'til finally the sunshine came
And the soupstone started into gathering dust, but it hung there just the same
And ever since then the food's been plenty, but every now and then I find
That mama in the kitchen with the wonderful soupstone, drifts across my mind

And again I can taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone
But it really wasn't nothing but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful, wonderful soupstone

And again I can taste the chicken and tomatoes

A no good man that you all know and he was lookin' around for Marie Lavaux

So Marie did some magic and she shook a little sand, she made a million dollars and she put it in his hand
Then she giggled and she wiggled and she said hey hey, I'm gettin' ready for my wedding day
But ol' Handsome Jack, he said ""Good-bye Marie, you too damn ugly for a rich man like me""
So Marie started cryin', her fangs started shakin', her body started turnin', she started quakin'

I was sitting in my basement I just rolled myself a taste
Of something green and gold and glorious to get me through the day
Then my friend yelled through the transom ""Grab your coat and get your hat son
There's a nut down on the corner, givin' dollar bills away""

But I laid around a bit
Then I had another hit
Then I rolled myself a bauma
Then I thought about my mama
Then I fooled around, played around
Jacked around a while and then

I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and it rolled right by
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned oh me oh my

Now it took seven months of urging just to get that local virgin
With the sweet face up to my place to fool around a bit
Next day she woke up rosy and she snuggled up so cosy
When she asked me how I liked it Lord it hurt me to admit

I was stoned and I missed it
I was stoned and I missed it
I was stoned and it rolled right by
I was stoned and I missed it
I was stoned and I missed it
I was stoned oh me oh my

Now I ain't makin' no excuses for the many things I uses
Just to sweeten my relationships and brighten up my day
But when my earthly race is over and I'm ready for the clover
And they ask me how my life has been I guess I'll have to say

And I remember her on the streets of New York City
As I walked the night needing some place warm to go
As she passed I said ""Hey there's snowflakes on your lashes""
And she laughed and said, ""That isn't snow""

She said, ""they're feathers from a pillow God is shaking in the sky""
And she opened smiling lips to catch a snowflake blowing by
And we both began to laugh and then I looked into her eyes
And it was warm again

But
I never got to know her very well
All we did was spend a little time
You're waiting for a story but there's really none to tell
She's just a passing shadow on my mind

But I remember her as we woke up warm together
In her sunlit room, and she said, ""I'll help you pack""
And she sewed my shirt and I said, ""I'll stay forever""
But she laughed and put some cookies in my sack

And she said ""Leave a trail of cookie crumbs as you walk through the snow
And someday I'll follow after and I'll find you where you go""
And I left her in her doorway but why I'll never know
But I was younger then

So
I never got to know her very well
All we did was spend a little time
You're waiting for a story but there's really none to tell
She's just a passing shadow on my mind

Oh you're waiting for a story but there's really none to tell

The tiger, he looked out of his cage and smiled
He said come here boy, I want to talk to you a while
He said I once was running wild and free just the same as you
But it's one step from the jungle to the zoo

Its one step from the jungle to the zoo
You better watch out or they're gonna get you too
They'll clip your claws, cut your hair, make a pussy cat out of you
Its one step from the jungle to the zoo

He said son when you go running through the grass
You bet look out for all the hidden traps
They'll feed you sweets and goodies 'til you're too fat to move
Then its one step from the jungle to the zoo

Its one step from the jungle to the zoo
You better watch out or they're gonna get you too
They'll clip your claws, yank your fangs, make a pussy cat out of you
Its one step from the jungle to the zoo

Only one step from the jungle to the zoo
You better watch out or they're gonna get you too

Rings of grass, crowns of flowers
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Furs that are woven of whispering hours
Gone, gone, gone, gone

She's gone away where the rings are real
And the furs have a warmth that a woman can feel
And 'round and 'round, around goes the wheel
And she's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Rings of grass, crowns of flowers
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Castles of sand with seashell towers
Gone, gone, gone, gone

She's gone away where the dreams are small
But the castles are rock and they never fall
And left me here to live among all
That is gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Rings of grass why do they die away?
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Whispering hours where do they fly away?
Gone, gone, gone, gone

And where's the wisdom to understand
That years will crumble all castles of sand
And the flowers and grass turn brown in our hands
When it's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

And ask the band to play us Auld Lang Syne

You never got to hear those violins
Did you girl?
No you never got to hear those violins, no

The castles that you built so high
Were just too steep for me to climb
And I guess these dirty streets of mine
Were just too rough for you

Just one of your sweet childhood dreams
But though I tried I could not make not one of them come true

Sal from the valley loved Al from the alley and they lived in harmony
Sally played acoustic and Al, he played electric and they both took turns on lead
They sang it for their friends, again and again of the places they had been
But their favourite song of all was called up on the mountain

Up on the mountain, up where the light breaks, that's where you'll find me
Gonna leave this worrisome world and it's trouble behind me
Up on the mountain, where the light breaks, that's where I'll be
I've barely got time to finish this song so say farewell for me

Then into the valley came a girl from the galleys, with a strange and smilin' face
Al played acoustic and Sally played electric, and the gal played a hell of a bass
And when they sang their harmonies, the lady dipped right in
She soon moved in and lived with them up on the mountain

And Sally from the valley and the gal from the galleys they live in mortal sin

I only know, Ruby, it's you
 
They say, Ruby you're like a song
You don't know right from wrong
And in your eyes I see heart aches for me
But from the start, who stole my heart?
Ruby, it's you
I hear your voice and I must come to you
I have no choice what else can I do? 
 
They say, Ruby you're like a flame
Into my life you came 
And though I should beware
Still I don't care you thrill me so

Just a half a mile from the Mississippi bridge

With ""hurry-home"" drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
But we were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee

You've made me break a many true vow

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

In a lot of ways, you're a lucky guy
Now all you need is a chance to try
Any love

In my heart there's a need to shout
Dyin', screamin', cryin' let me out
Are all those feelings that want to touch
Any love?

What a world for the lonely guy
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna lose my mind
Can anybody tell me just where to find
Any love, any love?

Everyone needs a love no doubt
Any love, Any love
Everybody feels alone without
Any love, any love

I know there's a love waiting
To enter my life, enter my life

Every day as I live
I try to think positive
I pray for someone good to come
Any love

Love is sweet and so divine
And I can't wait for my love life to shine
Can anybody tell me where I can find
Any love, any love?

Everyone needs a love no doubt
Any love, Any love
Everybody feels alone without
Any love, any love

I know there's someone waiting for me
To enter my life, Come into my life

Suddenly I'm up in clear blue skies
Lonely tears start to fill my eyes
I can weep, but I refuse to cry
I've got to keep holding on

To think love is strong
To keep holding on

Everyone needs a love no doubt
Any love, Any love
Everybody feels alone without
Any love, any love

And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand

And dream I'm dreamin'

just sittin' there.
On the little back porch it's about to fall apart
So I think I might repair it, just as I'm thinkin about repairin' it
Some little friends come along with some two-string, one string
No string guitars (Hey Chris wanna jam?), and they plug
Them all into the back porch, and they sit around playing all their favorite 
songs
And kickin back, feelin' real good, real fine, real full of the wine
And everything's fine, everything's beautiful, everything's great
And I just feel so good, you know I'm seventy years old and
I'm slurpin' everything through a straw
I'm sittin' here on the back porch just eatin' chocolate pudding through a straw
And I heated it up on a little sterno stove, tastes just like a warm body fluid 
goin' down
Little players comin' 'round, pluggin' in their instruments, feelin' good about
Themselves, singin' original songs, by the original masters
And I'm sittin' there on the porch, rockin' back 'n' forth in my little old 
chair

From the way I say my rap clear 
I make people more excited than a faggot that got a pap smear 
The crooked truth rap sensation, I ain't to be fucked with 
You better off practicin masturbation 
Line after line I bring excitement like a hooker

Throwin niggaz away like apple cores - I don't want to see shit

Slippin down to fall off dudes tryin to get they shit straight

Drawing by the purple pond, in the purple pastures Blue Flowers! 
Drawing by the purple pond, yellow ink that flows Blue Flowers! 
Drawing by the pond, look, it's raining yellow 
Would you care to listen to me more? Thank you 
Holding bags on down right from the hospital 
It's a patient that's worth to keep the germs off the turf 
Cybernetic microscopes and metal antidote 
Two telescopes that magnify the size of a roach 
Three computers to cup of coffee planted with my hand and 
Astroplanets detached turn on rear foggers 
Cut the light on the kid, and turn the bright on 
Supersonic waves combine and burn as brainwaves 
I see the mascot of Evil he's not Knievel 
Shakespeare's gone don't even think about it 
Yes, as I'm going to the park, I see... Blue Flowers! 
It's raining green, by the pond Blue Flowers! 
It's totally raining green, pouring Blue Flowers! 
I smell the bees and the birds Blue Flowers! 
Different aspects of life, blue flowers 

""Let me show you something""",Blue Flowers,1996
Dr. Octagon,"Dr. Octagon, paramedic focus on the East
For priests my anesthetics prescribe a certain fertilizer
Homegrown computer wise on the microphone
Utilizing tracks inverted by animical
High typical force, space sex intercourse
You get lost, and memorize to the Enterprise
Scotty the Captain, Mr. Spock keeps rappin'
Four two one two, the shit moves at warp speed
Dynamic seven, navigation of the coppers
Moving in crystals, operating light speed
I see the plants, they're growing

Blue flowers
Blue flowers

Cyber analog through virtual reality
Different colors of earth rocks in variety
Medical equal, with helmets on the space people
Galactic at 8, the verdict can't demonstrate
You be confused, and disobeying planet rules
Biochemistry, with stars for publicity
Megasonic bass, with data chips in your face
Nuclear lend drums, that bang hard on dark tracks
Reacting reverb, conscious spots on your nerve
I take a break like James Brown to the bridge

Sailing, takes me away
To wherever I'm really going, shoobedowop
Up, up, and away!
In my beautiful, balloon!
Optical biofeedback, magnetic borders
X-Ray you see skeletons fly North for the next day
We give passes covered with dioxalyn gases
Return

Here's George Jetson!
Back with intriguing positive minerals
You enter the center search and raiding at random
with no condom, no rubbers will reach the testicles
and effect em, by animal means, I'm in your spectrum
As I walk through the garden of orange tomatoes, I see

Blue flowers
Blue flowers
Blue flowers
blue flowers, yes",Blue Flowers Revisited,1996
