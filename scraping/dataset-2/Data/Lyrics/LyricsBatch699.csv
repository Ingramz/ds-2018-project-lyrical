Mauracher,"Just for that moment time stood still. 
Nothing mattered but the thrill of things to come and never knowin' where your goin'. 
A little nervous and out of practice, 
Sweaty palms and an awkward silience. 
You pulled me closer for a kiss and 
I'm so scared to feel like this. 
Can't stop my hands from shakin'.

I won't blink 'cause I might miss and 
I've waited way too long for this. 
The perfect words at the perfect time. 
The perfect song with the perfect rhyme 
Compose the soundtrack to our night. 
Are you listening?

Tonight the world will wait for us 
To say it's ok to move again. 
The stars will have to find another sky to 
Shed some light 'cause this is our time to shine.

Is there some place we could go to be alone? 
One last thing before you go. 
A little song to let you know that 
I never wanted to be anything but 
Everything to you my dear. 
But I spoke too soft for you to hear me say, 
""I wish that I could stay.""

And though it's our last night, 
Let's make it a lifetime before the sun comes up again. 
I know this is goodbye. 
I promise I won't cry if you promise you won't forget.",Shine,2003
Maurane,"Dors ma ville aux pluies d'automne
Odeurs de craie qu'enfant griffonne
Trottoirs mouillés
Les marronniers
Bonsoir

Dors, ma nuit au goût amer
De ces étés des bords de mer
Parents couchés
Rêves éveillés
Bonsoir

Tous mes souvenirs s'enfument
Aux trente bougies qui s'allument
Je soufflerai
J'arrêterai
Plus tard

Tous mes souvenirs s'écartent
Un peu semblables au jeu de cartes
Aux mains du joueur
Quand il n'y aura plus de donne
Même s'il y a maldonne

Au café des certitudes
Aux vieux flippers de l'habitude
Aux jeux gratuits
Des loteries
Bonsoir À l'idole qui finit mal
Avec Blondie dans un journal
Maîtres à penser
Maîtres à chanter
Bonsoir

C'est le temps de plus d'excuse
Au vieil écolier qui s'amuse
Ce qui n'est pas
Ne sera pas
Plus tard

Dans l'emploi du temps qui reste
Y a plus de nuits, y a plus de siestes
Y a plus de cafard
Ceux qui regardent en arrière
Ne voient que de la poussière

Oh, ma ville aux pluies d'automne
Un jour, si ton parfum m'étonne
Cheveux mouillés
Gorge serrée
Du soir

Promets-moi de faire silence
Avec mes souvenirs d'enfance
J'ai eu trente ans
Je suis content
Bonsoir",J'ai Eu Trente Ans,
Maurane,"Quand on n'a que l'amour
À s'offrir en partage
Au jour du grand voyage
Qu'est notre grand amour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Mon amour toi et moi
Pour qu'éclatent de joie
Chaque heure et chaque jour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour vivre nos promesses
Sans nulle autre richesse
Que d'y croire toujours

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour meubler de merveilles
Et couvrir de soleil
La laideur des faubourgs

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour unique raison
Pour unique chanson
Et unique secours

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour habiller matin
Pauvres et malandrins
De manteaux de velours

Quand on n'a que l'amour
À offrir en prière
Pour les maux de la terre
En simple troubadour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
À offrir à ceux-là
Dont l'unique combat
Est de chercher le jour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour parler aux canons
Et rien qu'une chanson
Pour convaincre un tambour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour tracer un chemin
À chaque carrefour

Alors, sans avoir rien
Que la force d'aimer
Nous aurons dans nos mains
Ma mie, le monde entier",Quand on N'A Que l'Amour,
Maurane,"Por la blanda arena
Que lame el mar
Su pequeña huella
No vuelve más
Un sendero solo
De pena y silencio llegó
Hasta el agua profunda
Un sendero solo
De penas mudas llegó
Hasta la espuma

Sabe Dios qué angustia
Te acompañó
Qué dolores viejos
Calló tu voz
Para recostarte
Arrullada en el canto
De las caracolas marinas
La canción que canta
En el fondo oscuro del mar
La caracola

Te vas Alfonsina
Con tu soledad
Qué poemas nuevos
Fuíste a buscar?
Una voz antigüa
De viento y de sal
Te requiebra el alma
Y la está llevando
Y te vas hacia allá
Como en sueños
Dormida, Alfonsina
Vestida de mar

Cinco sirenitas
Te llevarán
Por caminos de algas
Y de coral
Y fosforescentes
Caballos marinos harán
Una ronda a tu lado
Y los habitantes
Del agua van a jugar
Pronto a tu lado

Bájame la lámpara
Un poco más
Déjame que duerma
Nodriza, en paz
Y si llama él
No le digas que estoy
Dile que Alfonsina no vuelve
Y si llama él
No le digas nunca que estoy
Di que me he ido

Te vas Alfonsina
Con tu soledad
¿Qué poemas nuevos
Fueste a buscar?
Una voz antigua
De viento y de sal

Vestida de mar",Alfonsina y el Mar,1994
Maurane,"Tu claques la porte et tu descends l'escalier
T'arrives en bas, la rue est là
C'est plein de bruits d'odeurs et de fruits défendus
Et c'est qu'un début
Et t'as pas tout vu

Allez
Tope-là dans ma main, tope-là, hop-là
Tope encore une fois
T'as tout, t'as l'choix, c'est tout à toi
Tope-là dans ma main, tope-là, hop-là
Tope encore une fois
Tu rêves ou quoi t'en reviens pas.

La rue c'est la vie qui va
Viva la viva la vida
C'est là qu'on vit là qu'on va
Viva la viva la vida

Sur les trottoirs ça déboule de tous les côtés
Tu te surprends à regarder
Un bas de soie qui file au pied d'une inconnue
T'en es tout ému,
T'as pas tout perdu

Allez
Tope-là dans ma main, tope-là, hop-là
Tope encore une fois
C'est le sud en bas de chez toi
Tope-là dans ma main, tope-là, hop-là
Tope encore une fois
C'est tell'ment beau que t'y crois pas.

Lève les yeux et tu vois

Maurane,"Mine de rien tu te ballades
Sur mon cœur de cassonade 
C'est pas une partie d'rigolade
Tant pis pour moi je m'évade 
Ton cinéma ad libitum
De Barbe-bleue ou d'Oncle Tom 
Une carapace, un cœur de pomme
T'as tout pour un seul homme 

Est-ce que tu aimes, est-ce que tu joues? 
Où vas-tu? Je te sens tabou 
Qui es-tu devant moi farouche 
Et sûr de toi tu fais mouche
Même quand c'est du charabia 
J'aimerai tant que tu me donnes 
Le sésame que tu ne donnes à personne 
T'es toujours trop 
Mais toujours comme si t'avais tout pour un seul homme 

Quand tu causes t'es toujours drôle
Mais pourquoi tu self-control? 
Tu pourrais me laisser un rôle 
Au creux de ton épaule 
Je te vois au bout d'une impasse
Je plonge en douce mais toi tu passes 
J'arrive à toi mais c'est la tasse, déjà tu te casses 

Est-ce que tu aimes, est-ce que tu joues? 
Où vas-tu? Je te sens tabou 
Qui es-tu devant moi farouche et sûr de toi tu fais mouche
Même quand c'est du charabia 
J'aimerais tant que tu me donnes

Maurane,"Bien sûr, nous eûmes des orages
Vingt ans d'amour, c'est l'amour fol
Mille fois tu pris ton bagage
Mille fois je pris mon envol
Et chaque meuble se souvient
Dans cette chambre sans berceau
Des éclats des vieilles tempêtes
Plus rien ne ressemblait à rien
Tu avais perdu le goût de l'eau
Et moi celui de la conquête

Mon amour
Mon doux, mon tendre, mon merveilleux amour
De l'aube claire jusqu'à la fin du jour
Je t'aime encore, tu sais, je t'aime

Moi, je sais tous tes sortilèges
Tu sais tous mes envoûtements
Tu m'as gardé de pièges en pièges
Je t'ai perdu de temps en temps

Bien sûr tu pris quelques amants
Il fallait bien passer le temps
Il faut bien que le corps exulte
Et finalement, finalement
Il nous fallut bien du talent
Pour être vieux sans être adultes

Mais mon amour
Mon doux, mon tendre, mon merveilleux amour
De l'aube claire jusqu'à la fin du jour
Je t'aime encore, tu sais, je t'aime

Et plus le temps nous fait cortège
Et plus le temps nous fait tourment
Mais n'est-ce pas le pire piège
Que vivre en paix pour des amants
Bien sûr tu pleures un peu moins tôt
Je me déchire un peu plus tard
Nous protégeons moins nos mystères
On laisse moins faire le hasard
On se méfie du fil de l'eau
Mais c'est toujours la tendre guerre

Oh, mon amour
Mon doux, mon tendre, mon merveilleux amour 
De l'aube claire jusqu'à la fin du jour 
Je t'aime encore, tu sais, je t'aime",La Chanson des Vieux Amants,1999
Maurane,"J'ai la tête qui éclate
J'voudrais seulement dormir
M'étendre sur l'asphalte
Et me laisser mourir

Stone, le monde est stone
Je cherche le soleil
Au milieu de la nuit
J'sais pas si c'est la terre
Qui tourne à l'envers
Ou bien si c'est moi
Qui m'fait du cinéma
Qui m'fait mon cinéma

Je cherche le soleil
Au milieu de la nuit
Stone, le monde est stone

J'ai plus envie d'me battre
J'ai plus envie d'courir
Comme tous ces automates
Qui bâtissent des empires
Que le vent peut détruire
Comme des châteaux de cartes

Stone, le monde est stone
Laissez-moi me débattre
N'venez pas me secourir
Venez plutôt m'abattre
Pour m'empécher de souffrir
J'ai la tête qui éclate
J'voudrais seulement dormir
M'étendre sur l'asphalte
Et me laisser mourir
Laissez-moi me débattre
N'venez pas me secourir
Venez plutôt m'abattre
Pour m'empécher de souffrir

J'voudrais seulement dormir
M'étendre sur l'asphalte
Et me laisser mourir
Et me laisser mourir",Le Monde Est Stone,1999
Maurane,"Tu sais ma puce, j'ai perdu ton regard
Je ne suis plus le gamin, mon esprit a perdu cet espoir
De regarder la vie, la vraie qui nous entoure
Comme l'avait prédit la femme qui m'a donné le jour
Et le Paradis est loin d'être sur Terre
Mais qui nous a menti sur les hommes et leur volonté de faire
Des choses belles comme les écritures de ce monde
Et ne pas tâcher les murs avec le sang de la blanche colombe
Gros plan sur tes yeux débordants d'innocence
Gros plan sur un visage qui n'a subi aucune conséquence
De l'éducation de notre société
Où l'unification est l'utopie de cette humanité
Où les guerres, les tueries sont faites par les hommes
Qui ne veulent pas entendre les cris des gamins
Les plus jeunes
Je suis sur, au fond c'qui nous dérange
C'est que nos enfants sont des anges

Tu sais ma puce, j'n'ai pas envie que tu grandisses
Plus les années passent, plus on accumule des vices
Tu sais les grands malheureusement ont besoin d'artifices
De bénéfices, de gloire et même d'édifices
Reste longtemps l'enfant, la petite malice
Avant de rejoindre les rangs des adultes complices
Mais de tout ça, j'veux pas m'l'imaginer
J'préfère de loin te regarder
Jouer à la poupée

Tu sais ma puce, la suite n'est pas facile
Tu vas apprendre et comprendre que les grands sont vite des imbéciles
Quelque soient les personnes, quelque soit le profil
Tout au fond de chaque homme, se cachent des sentiments hostiles
Hostiles à quoi ?
A soi-même et surtout aux autres
Souviens-toi de Jésus, trahi par l'un de ses apôtres
Ne construis pas autour de toi ce genre de destin
Et continue, tes pas ouvrent ton cœur, il guidera ton chemin
Vers, je l'espère ce qu'il y a de mieux
Vers des contrées lointaines, où les enfants sont bénis par les dieux
Comme dans les rêves, l'image d'un monde parfait
Où tout un pays, tout un peuple est réuni dans la paix
J'ai vu ton regard refléter cet Eden
Quand tu touchais le ciel avec le palet de ta marelle
Je suis sûr ce qu'il y a de plus étrange
C'est que nos enfants sont des anges

Tu sais ma puce, j'n'ai pas envie que tu grandisses
Plus les années passent, plus on accumule des vices
Tu sais les grands malheureusement ont besoin d'artifices
De bénéfices, de gloire et même d'édifices
Reste longtemps l'enfant, la petite malice
Avant de rejoindre les rangs des adultes complices
Mais de tout ça, j'veux pas m'l'imaginer
J'préfère de loin te regarder
Jouer à la poupée

Tu sais ma puce, on grandit c'est la vie
Mais non, pas seulement en âge, mais surtout en état d'esprit
Entre le Bien et le Mal, on perd les raccourcis
Peut-être que c'est l'enfant et l'homme, ainsi qui nous différencient
Je reste là, devant toi, tout en admiration
Devant tous ces gamins qui ont les yeux remplis de questions
Et vous demande si cela vous dérange
Si nos enfants étaient les anges

Tu sais ma puce, j'n'ai pas envie que tu grandisses
Plus les années passent, plus on accumule des vices
Tu sais les grands malheureusement ont besoin d'artifices
De bénéfices, de gloire et même d'édifices
Reste longtemps l'enfant, la petite malice
Avant de rejoindre les rangs des adultes complices
Mais de tout ça, j'veux pas m'l'imaginer
J'préfère de loin te regarder
Jouer à la poupée",La Poupée,2000
Maurane,"Douce comme la mousse
Egale et verticale
Jamais ne s'emballe
Ne s'éclabousse.
Ses yeux: deux lacs où je me noie
Ces mots: des claques... une langue de bois

L'amie est redoutable... 
Complice et insidieuse
Rassurante et affable... 
Petite flamme en veilleuse.

L'amie complémentaire
Est à double tranchant
Mielleuse ou militaire... 
Et toujours... gentiment.

Pousse pas... chérie
Non, je ne suis pas dupe.
Dans tes airs, tes manies...

Glousse toujours... déambule...

Ont-elles des chemins tout tracés
Quand je revois le mien, je penche
Pour une vie sur le bas-côté

J'ai mes rivières au bord de l'eau
Courants contraires aux idéaux
J'ai mes croisières sans paquebot
Aux vents contraires des hisse et haut

Quand même les pensées font du bruit
Ecoute, écoute le jour qui flanche
Ecoute-le tomber la nuit

A copier-coller l'air du temps

Peut-être bien demain
De retrouver l'amour

A la vie, aux chemins

Dans un coin de verdure
Aux rendez-vous manqués
Aux absences qui durent

Tu as senti la nuit venir
Tu es parti avant la fin
Le dernier acte était le pire
J’ai le beau rôle et c’est très bien

J’hésite entre Médée, Hermione
Ariane par l’amour blessée
Vodka, king size et je rayonne
Seule enfin sur le canapé

Pourtant j’aimais tes sillons bleus
Et tes iris de citron vert
Les nuits blanches, l’oiseau de feu
Et nos amours fous de plein air

On se lasse de tout mon ange
Disait la divine Marquise
Je n’aime pas qu’on me dérange
Longtemps des brillantes banquises

Tu as dû voir la nuit venir
Tu es parti avant la fin
Le dernier acte était le pire
J’ai le beau rôle et c’est très bien

Je m’aime plus que tous les rois
Je parade avec mes bijoux
Et mon noble péplum de soie
Je suis le meilleur des joujoux

Enfin seule sur les tapis
Ravie je joue à la poupée
Jaguar au collier de rubis
Au fond des longs miroirs glacés

Pour le meilleur et sans le pire
Je vais reprendre mon envol
Avec mon hermine et ma lyre
Bye bye chéri bye bye guignol

The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.

From some enchanted land.

I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Worthy of a mighty nation

Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Maureen O'Hara,"I sit alone in the golden daylight,
But all I see is a silver sky;
For in my fancy I sweep away light,
And keep my image of the sky,
Just the way we like it, you and I.

All through the day I dream about the night,
I dream about the night, Here with you.
All through the day I wish away the time,
Until the time when I'm here with you.

Down falls the sun, I run to meet you,
The evening mist melts away;
Down smiles the moon, And soon your lips recall
The kiss I dreamed of all through the day.",All Through the Day,1958
Maureen O'Hara,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I

But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,1958
Maureen O'Hara,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

Maureen O'Hara,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1958

You'd be so nice by the fire

You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

Maureen O'Hara,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1994
Maureen Smith,"If I could make a wish I think I'd pass
Can't think of anything I need
No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound
Nothing to eat, no books to read

Has left me peaceful warm and tired
What more could I ask 
There's nothing left to be desired
Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak
Sleep, silent angel go to sleep

Sometimes all I need 
Is the air that I breathe 
And to love you

Girl, there's more than enough to last a whole life through
And it's all for you

There's so few women now a days
Who understand the soul of a man
They're always on the talking end
Never giving, never offering a helping hand
But baby, I can count on you
Whenever trouble calls
You see me through 
You show your love in so many ways
And I'm gonna love you for the rest of my days

I've got so much love to give you
Baby, I've got so much love to give you
Girl, there's more than enough to last a whole life through
And it's all for you",So Much Love,1997

Maurice André,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Windmills of Your Mind (from the film The Thomas Crown Affair (1968)),2004

Little things of jade

And anagrams

Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,

Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin

Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from

Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes

Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in place of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

But, it's a long, long while, from May to December
And the days grow short
When you reach September
And the autumn weather
Turns the leaves to flame
I haven't got time
For the waiting game

And the days turn to gold
As they grow few
September, November
And these few golden days
I'd share with you

Et comme elle prenait chaque jour la rue Custine

Avec de grands pieds, une taille d'hippopotame
Vivement elle m'saute au cou
Me crie ""bonjour, mon loup""
Je lui dis ""pardon madame, mais qui êtes vous?""

Elle me répond ""mais c'est moi, Valentine""

Je pensais, rempli d'effroi

To be in love with you.
Beautiful! You're so beautiful,
You haunt me all day through.

Every little breeze seems to whisper ""Louise.""
Birds in the trees seem to twitter ""Louise.""
Each little rose
Tells me it knows I love you, love you.

Every little beat that I feel in my heart,
Seems to repeat, What I felt from the start,
Each little sigh
Tells me that I adore you, Louise.

Just to see and hear you
Brings joy I never knew.
But to be so near you,
Thrills me through and through.

Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss,
It had to be But the wonder is this:
Can it be true,
Someone like you Could love me, Louise?

And gentle as a dove.
Heaven sent! You were heaven sent,

Life is so uncertain and no one seems to know
How long we have to linger on
Tomorrow we may both be gone

My love is yours to have, to hold
Don't wait until the moon is old

Un maçon
Chantait une chanson
Là-haut sur le toit d'une maison,
Et la voix de l'homme s'envola
Pour se poser par là
Comme un oiseau sur la
Voix d'un autre maçon
Qui reprit la chanson
Sur le toit voisin de la maison
Et ainsi commença l'unisson
De deux maçons et d'une chanson ! son ! sons !

De maçon en maçon,
De pignon en pignon
Et de rue en ville et en village,
La chanson prit son vol,
Et dans sa course folle
Accrocha tous les échafaudages.

Parce que dans le pays tout entier

Refrain :

Mill' maçons
Chantaient une chanson
Tout là-haut sur le toit des maisons
Ça leur donnait du coeur au boulot
Les matériaux
Tout seuls !
Semblaient monter tout seuls !
Et les maisons
Poussaient comme des champignons
Ça faisait la joie des compagnons
Qui chantaient avec tous les maçons
Tout là-haut, sur le toit des maisons.

3
De chantier en chantier
Tous les corps de métier
Travaillaient et chantaient en cadence.
Le soleil dans le ciel
Trouva tout naturel
De rentrer à son tour dans la danse.
C'est alors qu'il m'est venu cette idée,
Vous n'en ferez que ce que vous voudrez :

Refrain :
Si tout l' mond' chantait comm' les maçons
Si chacun apportait son moëllon,
Nous rebâtirions notre maison
Qui deviendrait, Bon Dieu !
La maison du Bon Dieu !

Serait la plus bell' des chansons
Et quand viendrait la belle saison
Nous serions des millions de maçons
A chanter sous le toit d' nos maisons !",La Chanson du Macon,1992

Fleur de Paris.
C'est une fleur de Paris,
Du vieux Paris qui sourit,
Car c'est la fleur du retour,
Du retour des beaux jours.
Pendant quatre ans dans nos coeurs
Elle a gardé ses couleurs,
Bleu, Blanc, Rouge,
Avec l'espoir elle a fleuri,
Fleur de Paris.

2.
Le paysan la voyait fleurir dans ses champs,
Le vieux curé l'adorait dans un ciel tout blanc,
Fleur d'espérance,
Fleur de bonheur.
Tous ceux qui se sont battus pour nos libertés,
Au petit jour, devant leurs yeux l'ont vu briller,
La fleur de France
Aux trois couleurs.

REFRAIN

C'est une fleur de chez nous,
Elle a fleuri de partout,
Car c'est la fleur du retour,
Du retour des beaux jours.
Pendant quatre ans dans nos coeurs
Elle a gardé ses couleurs,
Bleu, Blanc, Rouge,
Elle était vraiment avant tout
Fleur de chez nous",Fleur de Paris,1992
Maurice Chevalier,"J'ai chanté l'amour, j'ai chanté y a de la joie
Sans grande joie pourtant
J'entonnais donc un petit air à pleine voix
L'air fut étouffant
Désormais quels seront donc les pauvres mots
Sur les chansons gaies qu'pour vous on invente
On osera placer et sans hésiter trop
Pour ne pas m'tromper moi voilà c'que j'chante

Tra la la la la-la
Tra la la la la-la

Avec un ou deux p'tits hop-là hop-là
Si vous voulez savoir
C'que mon cœur pense ce soir
En chantant comme ça
Dzim pa poum pa la
C'est notre espoir

En somme, l'important c'était d'recommencer
Qu'importe l'expression
L'essentiel était de pouvoir dispenser
Du reve en chansons
Un poète aurait trouvé les mots qu'il faut
Qui aurait rimé ses vœux l'espérance

Moi mon espoir c'est qu'le ciel redevienne beau
Et qu'on chante en paix dans notre vieille France

Tra la la la la-la
Tra la la la la-la

Maurice Chevalier,"De  Rochechouart jusqu'à Ménilmuche
D'la rue d'Lappe à la rue d'la Gaité

Qui avec la mienn' pourrait lutter
De la tête aux pieds quand on l'épluche
On ne trouv' rien à lui reprocher
C'est un oiseau rar'
Que Roi des veinards
J'ai eu le bonheur de dénicher :

Ah ! si vous connaissiez ma poule,
Vous en perdriez tous la boule.
Ses p'tits seins pervers
Qui pointent au travers
De son pull-over
Vous mettent la tête à l'envers !
Elle a des jambes faites au moule
Des cheveux fous, frisés partout
Et tout et tout...
Si vous la voyiez,
Vous en rêveriez !
Ah ! si vous connaissiez ma poule.

Bien qu'elle s'habille aux prix unique
Pas un' ne saurait la dégotter
Ell' dame le pion, ell' fait la nique
Aux plus fameus's reines de beauté
La miss France et la miss Amérique
Sont de la crott' de bique à côté
Sans diam' et sans clips
Elle vous éclips',
Toutes les stars les plus réputées:

Ah si vous connaissiez ma poule,
Vous en perdriez tous la bpoule.
Marlène et Darrieux
N'arrivent qu'en deux
La Greta Garbo
Peut mêm' retirer son chapeau !
Ils n'en ont pas à Liverpoole
A New York, à Honolulu,
De mieux foutu...
Si vous la voyiez
Vous en rêveriez !
Ah ! si vous connaissiez ma poule.

Marguerit' de Bourgogne auprès d'elle
N'avait que nib comm' tempérament
Il faut l'entendre quand elle appelle
Son petit Momo au grand moment
Son corps frissonn' d'une façon telle
Que la maison tremble également
Et ça vous expliqu'
Les secouss's sismiqu's
Dont les journaux parlaient récemment:

Ah ! si vous connaissiez ma poule,
Vous en perdriez tous la boule.
Ses baisers moelleux
Font dresser les ch'veux
Ses baisers profonds
Vous font sauter jusqu'au plafond !
Si vous saviez comme elle roucoule
On l'entend jusqu'au fond d'Passy
Crier... chéri !
Si vous la voyiez
Vous m'la chiperiez !
Mais... vous n'connaitrez pas ma poule.",Ah! Si Vous Connaissiez Ma Poule,1992
Maurice Chevalier,"En voyage ou au cinéma
Vous avez vu l'Himalaya
L'Acropole ou Pompéi
L'Espagne au ciel fleuri
Vous avez vu Londres et ses Miss
Bruxelles et son Mannequen Piss
Jusqu'aux îles Hawaï
C'est beau, see'est très joli
Mais tout ça voyez-vous
Ce n'est rien Monsieur
Rien du tout
Je connais beaucoup mieux

Avez-vous vu le nouveau chapeau de Zozo?
C'est un chapeau, un papeau rigolo
Sur le devant, on a passé trois plumes de paon
Sur le côté, un amour de perroquet
Pour être original, il l'est, ça je vous le jure
Ça n'est pas le bibi, le bibi de n'importe qui
A le voir si beau, tout Paris répétera bientôt:
Avez-vous vu le chapeau de Zozo?

A première vue il surprend
Il est un peu extravagant
Ne dites pas que je vous l'ai dit
Il sort de chez Monoprix
Aussi quand je passe à son bras
On fait: oh! oh! on fait: eh! ah!
Mais croyez bien que je n'en suis pas
Plus fier que tout cela
Et depuis dans mon quartier
Ce n'est plus qu'un cri
Tous les gens parlent de ""lui"" et l'on dit:

Je lis dans vos yeux une question:
Pourquoi donc tant d'admiration
Pourquoi tant d'amour enfin
Pour ce petit galurin?
Je vais vous expliquer le pourquoi:
Lorsque pour le première fois
Elle vint à mon rendez-vous
Elle l'avait, see'est tout
En le voyant, j'ai reçu un grand coup au cœur
Et depuis il est tout mon bonheur",Le Chapeau de Zozo,1992
Maurice Chevalier,"Sur le bord du lac Léman, un beau jour d'été
Je la vis passer et sans hésiter
Voyant son regard charmant, je lui dis bientôt 
""Voulez-vous faire un tour en bateau?"" 
""Oh non"" dit-elle en rougissant 
J'ajoutais très prévenant

Donnez-moi la main mam'zelle et ne dites rien
Mon canot vous semble frêle, donnez-moi la main
Seule sur la rive, vous semblez craintive
N'auriez-vous pas le pied marin?
Donnez-moi la main bien vite, vous ne voulez pas? 
Redouteriez-vous, petite, de faire un faux-pas? 
Lancez-moi votre ombrelle et quittez cet air inquiet 
Donnez-moi la main mam'zelle, ah ça y est

Nous voguions très lentement et je l'admirais 
En pensant tout bas quel sourire frais
Un beau cygne fièrement passa près de nous
Elle fit un mouvement si doux

Que tout à coup, n'y tenant plus
Je murmurai très ému

Donnez-moi la main mam'zelle et ne dites rien
Puisque l'amour nous appelle, donnez-moi la main
Laissez-moi vous dire que je vous désire
Que c'est plus qu'un petit béguin
Donnez-moi la main bien vite, vous ne voulez pas? Ha-ha!
Refuseriez-vous, petite, de faire un faux-pas? 
Ouvrez grand votre ombrelle pour nous cacher des curieux 
Donnez-moi la main mam'zelle, ah c'est mieux

Puis ce fut le charme exquis du plus doux baiser 
Que sur un bras blanc ma lèvre ait posé 
Ce baiser m'avait conquis, troublé même au point
Que je voulus aller bien plus loin
Mais voyant qu'elle tremblait de peur
Je compris enfin sa candeur, mm-hmm!

Donnez-moi la main mam'zelle et ne craignez rien
Pardonnez mon trop grand zèle, donnez-moi la main
Voyez je suis sage, voici le rivage
Quittons-nous tels de bons copains
Donnez-moi la main bien vite, oui comme cela
Ne redoutez plus, petite, de faire un faux-pas
Reprenez votre ombrelle, faites-moi vos jolis yeux
Donnez-moi la main mam'zelle
Adieu!",Donnez-Moi la Main Mam'zelle,1992

Maurice Chevalier,"Il faut rester Masdames Messieurs
Tels que nous as faits le Bon Dieu
Car entre nous c'est prétentieux
C'est vaniteux et c'est idiot
De se corriger de ses défauts
Petits et gros
Tous nos défauts en vérité
Font notre originalité
Avec eux nous sommes nés
Et vous les éliminer
C'est voler Dieu qui nous les as donnés

On est comme on est
On est beau on est laid
On est grand ou gringalet
On est replet ou maigrelet
Un a, c'est selon
Un nez court, un nez long
On a de petits petons
Ou bien de très grands ripatons
Pourquoi modifier
Pourquoi rectifier
Au lieu de s'en glorifier
Ce dont on nous a gratifié
On est comme on est
Nos défauts gardons-les
C'est à ça qu'on nous reconnaît!

Pour vous prouver que c'est bien vrai
Si Monsieur Lebrun devenait
Très élégant et super chic
Serait-il aussi sympathique
Et sourirait-on gentiment
En le voyant
Et tout à coup si Fernandel
A l'instar de Cécile Sorel
Se faisait remonter le menton
Pour avoir le visage plus rond
A de tels appointements l'engagerait-on?

On est comme on est
Si Maë West devenait
Tout d'un coup mince comme un fil
Garderait-elle son sex appeal
Si Tino Rossi n'avait pas ici
Gratté sa guitare ainsi
Aurait-il aussi réussi
Si Michel Simon
Voulait supposons
Devenir beau comme Apollon

On est beau on est laid

Maurice Chevalier,"1. Par précaution on a beau mettre
Des croisillons à nos fenêtres
Passer au bleu nos devantures
Et jusqu'aux pneus de nos voitures
Désentoiler tous nos musées
Chambouler les Champs Elysées
Emmailloter de terre battue
Toutes les beautés de nos statues

Plonger dans le noir la ville lumière

Plus on voit briller son esprit
Paris sera toujours Paris !

2. Pour qu'à ce bruit chacun s'entraîne
On peut la nuit jouer d'la sirène
Nous contraindre à faire le zouave
En pyjama dans notre cave
On aura beau par des ukases

Nous imposer le masque à gaz
Des mots croisés à quatre cases
Nous obliger dans nos demeures
A nous coucher tous à onze heures

Paris sera toujours Paris !

3. Bien que ma foi, depuis octobre
Les robes soient beaucoup plus sobres
Qu'il why ait moins d'fleurs et moins d'aigrettes
Que les couleurs soient plus discrètes
Bien qu'aux galas on élimine
Les chinchillas et les hermines
Que les bijoux pleins de décence
Brillent surtout par leur absence
Que la beauté soit moins voyante
Moins effrontée moins provocante...

Paris sera toujours Paris !
La plus belle ville do monde
Même quand au loin le canon gronde
Sa tenue est encore plus jolie...

N'en ont alors que plus de prix

Maurice Chevalier,"On se rappelle toujours sa première amie
J'ai gardé d'la mienne un souvenir pour la vie
Un jour qu'il avait plu
Tous deux on s'était plu
Et puis on se plut de plus en plus

J'lui d'mandait son nom, elle me dit ""Valentine""
Et comme elle prenait chaque jour la rue Custine
Je pris le même chemin
Et puis j'lui pris la main
J'l'embrassais, enfin

Elle avait de tout petits petons, Valentine, Valentine
Elle avait un tout petit piton
Que je tâtais à tâtons, ton-ton-tontaine
Elle avait un tout petit menton, Valentine, Valentine
Outre ses petits petons, son p'tit piton, son petit menton
Elle était frisée comme un mouton

Hier, sur le boulevard, je rencontre une grosse dame
Avec de grands pieds, une taille d'hippopotame
Vivement elle m'saute au cou
Me crie ""bonjour, mon loup""
Je lui dis ""pardon madame, mais qui êtes vous?""

Elle me répond ""mais c'est moi, Valentine""
Devant son double menton, sa triple poitrine
Je pensais, rempli d'effroi
Qu'elle a changé, ma foi
Dire qu'autre fois

Elle avait de tout petits petons, Valentine, Valentine
Elle avait un tout petit piton
Que je tâtais à tâtons, ton-ton-tontaine

Never will I meet one sweeter than you.
Would you turn away or could you
Really every care, 
If I'd ever dare to say, 
""I Love you.""

[Chorus]
If the nightingales could sing like you,
They'd sing much sweeter than they do,
For you brought a new kind of love to me.

If the Sandman brought me dreams of you,
I'd want to sleep my whole life through,
For you brought a new kind of love to me.

I know that you're the queen, and I'm the slave,
And yet you will understand
That underneath it all 
You're a maid, and I am only a man.

I would work and slave the whole day through
If I could hurry home to you;
For you brought a new kind of love to me.",You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me,1993

L'amour du pays natal.

Refrain :
Les gars d'Ménilmontant
Sont toujours remontants
Même en redescendant
Les rues de Ménilmuche
Ils ont le coeur ardent,
Le coeur et tout l'restant
Tant qu'ils s'en vont chantant :
Ménilmontant !

Ils s'en vont la mine fière,
Droit devant eux dans la rue.
Et s'ils baissent les paupières,
C'est sur un mollet dodu.
D'un coup d'oeil ils vous font l'inventaire
Des trésors bien cachés par une ingénue.

Refrain

Il faut voir comme ils décochent
Tous les traits de leur esprit,
Et ce esprit de gavroche,
C'est le bon coeur à crédit.
Et Mimi Pinson dans leur caboche
A laissé la chanson et la poésie...

Refrain

V'là les gars de mon village,
Ni plus mauvais, ni meilleurs
Que tous les gars à la plage
De Paris ou bien d'ailleurs.
Ils seront les jeunots d'un autre âge
Qui rendra au pays toute sa grandeur.

Refrain",La Marche de Ménilmontant,1994
Maurice Chevalier,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more",Mon Homme,1994
Maurice Chevalier,"Wonderful! Oh, it's wonderful
To be in love with you.
Beautiful! You're so beautiful,
You haunt me all day through.

Every little breeze seems to whisper ""Louise.""
Birds in the trees seem to twitter ""Louise.""
Each little rose
Tells me it knows I love you, love you.

Every little beat that I feel in my heart,
Seems to repeat, What I felt from the start,
Each little sigh
Tells me that I adore you, Louise.

Just to see and hear you
Brings joy I never knew.
But to be so near you,
Thrills me through and through.

Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss,
It had to be But the wonder is this:
Can it be true,
Someone like you could love me, Louise?

Innocent! You're so innocent
And gentle as a dove.
Heaven sent! You were heaven sent,
An angel from above.

Every little breeze seems to whisper ""Louise.""
Birds in the trees seem to twitter ""Louise.""
Each little rose
Tells me it knows I love you, love you.

Every little beat that I feel in my heart,
Seems to repeat, What I felt from the start,
Each little sigh
Tells me that I adore you, Louise.

Often when I'm gloomy
And in my lonely room.
Thoughts of you come to me,
Like a sweet perfume.

It had to be But the wonder is this:
Can it be true,
Someone like you could love me, Louise?",Louise/Mimi,1995

Là-haut sur la butte

Maurice Chevalier,"Poor boy! Poor boy!
Down-hearted and depressed and in a spin
Poor boy! Poor boy!
Oh, youth can really do a fellow in!

How lovely to sit here in the shade
With none of the woes of man and maid
I'm glad I'm not young anymore

The rivals that don't exist at all
The feeling you're only two feet tall
I'm glad that I'm not young anymore

No more confusion
No morning-after surprise
No self-delusion
That when you're telling those lies
She isn't wise

And even if love comes through the door
The chance that goes on forevermore
Forevermore is shorter than before
Oh, I'm so glad that I'm not young anymore

The tiny remark that tortures you
The fear that your friends won't like her too
I'm glad I'm not young anymore
The longing to end the stale affair
Until you find out she doesn't care
I'm glad that I'm not young anymore

No more frustration
No star-crossed lover am I
No aggravation
Just one reluctant reply
""Lady, goodbye!""

They grow up in 
The most delightful way.

So helpless and appealing

J'ajoutais très prévenant

Ouvrez grand votre ombrelle pour nous cacher des curieux 
Donnez-moi la main mam'zelle, ah c'est mieux

Puis ce fut le charme exquis du plus doux baiser 
Que sur un bras blanc ma lèvre ait posé 
Ce baiser m'avait conquis, troublé même au point
Que je voulus aller bien plus loin
Mais voyant qu'elle tremblait de peur
Je compris enfin sa candeur, mm-hmm!

Donnez-moi la main mam'zelle et ne craignez rien
Pardonnez mon trop grand zèle, donnez-moi la main
Voyez je suis sage, voici le rivage
Quittons-nous tels de bons copains

En laissant sa femme au logis

Malgré son p'tit air effacé
Il portait un nom à la gomme

Car il sortait d'une grande école

Maurice Coyle,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!

Maurice Coyle,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory

Maurice Davis,"Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly

Ever a surprise
Ever as before and ever just as sure as the sun will rise

I can't live without him

Never treats me sweet and gentle

And that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around
My man an' I, we gin some
We pray some, and sin some

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn

You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high sang a lullaby

You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

Maurice de Abravanel,"My ship has sails that are made of silk,
The decks are trimmed with gold,
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold.

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin,
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in.

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring,
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing.

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring
My own true love to me,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me.",My Ship [From Lady in the Dark],1997

Maurice Garrel,"Oh, je voudrais tant que tu te souviennes
Cette chanson était la tienne
C'était ta préférée, je crois
Qu'elle est de Prévert et Kosma

Et chaque fois les feuilles mortes
Te rappellent à mon souvenir
Jour après jour les amours mortes
N'en finissent pas de mourir

Avec d'autres bien sûr, je m'abandonne
Mais leur chanson est monotone
Et peu à peu je m'indiffère
À cela il n'est rien à faire

Car chaque fois, les feuilles mortes
Te rappellent à mon souvenir
Jour après jour les amours mortes
N'en finissent pas de mourir

Peut-on jamais savoir par où commence
Et quand fini l'indifférence?
Passe l'automne, vienne l'hiver
Et que la chanson de Prévert

Et ce jour là, mes amours mortes
En auront fini de mourir

En auront fini de mourir",La Chanson de Prévert,2003

A me morfondre
Dans quelque pub anglais
Du cœur de Londres
Parcourant l’Amour Monstre de Pauwels
Me vint une vision
Dans l’eau de Seltz

Tandis que des médailles
D’impérator
Font briller à sa taille
Le bronze et l’or
Le platine lui grave
D’un cercle froid
La marque des esclaves
A chaque doigt

Jusques en haut des cuisses
Elle est bottée
Et c’est comme un calice
A sa beauté
Elle ne porte rien
D’autre qu’un peu
D’essence de Guerlain
Dans les cheveux

A chaque mouvement
On entendait
Les clochettes d’argent
De ses poignets
Agitant ses grelots
Elle avança
Et prononça ce mot

All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

I'm searching for the world that I come from
Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
Look within your heart then ask,
Have you seen my childhood?

Cause I love such elementary things,

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Que le vent de la mer et le soleil chamaillent

Je pourrais vous parler d'elle jusqu'à demain

Maurice Larcange,"If it takes forever I will wait for you
For a thousand summers I will wait for you
Till you're back beside me, till I'm holding you
Till I hear you sigh here in my arms

Anywhere you wander, anywhere you go
Every day remember how I love you so
In your heart believe what in my heart I know
That forevermore I'll wait for you

The clock will tick away the hours one by one
Then the time will come when all the waiting's done
The time when you return and find me here and run
Straight to my waiting arms

If it takes forever I will wait for you
For a thousand summers I will wait for you
Till you're here beside me, till I'm touching you
And forevermore sharing your love",Les Parapluies de Cherbourg,2006

Hey little brother

Hey sis how you doing?

Fine, what's going on with you?

Oh nothing much

Got your message from earlier this afternoon
And something just didn't sound right
And so I'm calling you back to check on you
How you holding up?

Oh everything is fine

You know I don't believe you

Whatcha saying? You think I'm lying?

I'm not saying it, but I know you

How you know me?

Cause you're my brother
And therefore I can tell
When something is troubling you

OK OK, I give you that
Nothing's wrong, I take that back
There is something on my mind
But sis, I don't want to waste your time

But I done told you time and time again
Whatever you're going through
You can come and talk to me
And I will say a prayer with you

But I done prayed and prayed night and day
I still can't seem to find my way

Rob that ain't nothing but the devil telling you
That you're washed up and you're through
But sister's here to let you know
Boy you're gonna make it through

Sister, do you really believe that I can rise again

Yes, and not only that, Rob, God will forgive you for your sins

Can you tell me what to do?

Well first you gotta believe the truth

Sometimes it's hard to believe in Him

That's okay because he believes in you

The winds, the rain
The storm
The weapons that are formed against us (I will survive)
The trying times
The sleepless nights
Just know that faith is with us (and I believe yeah)
Through all of the hills
And valleys roamed
That we must come to (woah)
Walk side by side
Follow the light
And we'll make it through (We'll make it through yeah)

So, so what you're saying is believe a little more?

Yes, cause faith is the key that will opens up the door

What you're saying to me, it's hard to receive
Especially when trouble follows me

When we're keeping it real
Robert sometimes
Trouble can follow where you lead

Yes sister, I know sometimes, but I

Just wait, let me make a phone call

To who?

A prayer buddy of mine
She can help you tear down your walls

I don't want nobody in my business

She's a friend
And besides you need this

You know how church folk can be

Boy I'm your sister, trust in me

Mm

Now hold on

Maybe she's gone

No

Maybe we ought to just try...

Hello

Shh shh, hello, is Kim there?

Yes, I think she's around here somewhere
Hold on

Now you just let me do the talking

Mm hmm

Hello?

Hey girl, how you doing?

Hey Kelly

My little brother's on the line and needed advice from you

Ooh what can I do for you?
Hello?

Go ahead Rob, she's talking to you

Oh, well, I know you must be very busy
So I'm not going to mess around, nah
Just telling my sister how my life is upside down
And I don't know whether I'm going left or right half the time
Sometimes think I'm gonna lose my mind, you feel me?

Mm hmm, similar to what I used to go through

Really?

Yes, and sometimes I still do

Yeah?

See it doesn't matter who you are
Or where you're from
If you struggle, God will use you

Amen sister, what you're saying is so true
Rob are you there?

Yes, I'm just listening to the both of you
It's so easy to say, but not so easy to do

Yes but if you stand the truth
It will free you

Oh

Just stand strong

Stand strong

With your head held high

Will he?

Yes he will

And keep on running

And down to the end

He'll give you peace
In the midst of your storm

Sometimes I feel like it's too late for me

But he'll never leave you

No way

You just gotta hang on

Hang on

Robert say a prayer, keep your head
God will do just what he said

Finally I think I get it

Sonnant du corps comme cor à Roncevaux
Elles balancent leur plastique
Leurs bombes anatomiques

Maurice Vander,"Que se passe-t-il ?
J?y comprends rien
Y avait une ville
Et y a plus rien

Je m?souviens que j?marchais
Que j?marchais dans une rue
Au milieu d?la cohue
Sous un joyeux soleil de mai
C?était plein de couleurs
De mouvements et de bruits
Une fille m?a souri
Et je m?souviens que j?la suivais?
Je la suivais
Sous le joyeux soleil de Mai
Chemin faisant j?imaginais
Un mot gentil pour l?aborder
Et puis voici
Que dans le ciel bleu de midi
De plus en plus fort j?entendis
Comme arrivant de l?infini
Ce drôle de bruit
Ce drôle de bruit

Je m?souviens que les gens
S?arrêtèrent de marcher
Et d?un air étonné
Tout le monde a levé le nez
Vers le ciel angélique
Couleur de paradis
D?ou sortait cette musique
Comme accordée sur l?infini?
C?était étrange?
Est-ce qu?il allait neiger des anges
Les gens guettaient dans un mélange
D?inquiétude et d?amusement?
Et brusquement,
Il y eut un éclair aveuglant
Et dans un souffle incandescent
Les murs se mirent à trembler





Qu?s?est-il-passé ?
J?y comprends rien
Y avait une ville
Et y a plus rien

Y a plus rien qu?un désert
De gravats de poussière
Qu?un silence à hurler
À la place ou il y avait
Une ville qui battait
Comme un c?ur prodigieux

Etaient pleins du soleil de mai

That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.

Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.

When the memories are bright?
What to say when I see you
And you tell me it was true?

And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

While we're not supposed to do so

You make the kings of the jungle roar
You're the finest that I have met this year or any year before 

Now I can't live with you

And I can't live with you

Either way I can't stand it now
So baby stay away and please

Do squeeze too hard sometimes
Provoking thoughts that would perfectly fit
Into a gallery of famous crimes
But when your lips are near and you're giving me 
One of your juicy grins
Provoking physics that would perfectly fit
Into a gallery of famous sins

Mauro Ermanno Giovanardi,"La tele resta spenta e non la guardo più
Ho un nodo in gola che è difficile mandare giù
Fumo un po', sposto via la tenda
Cielo grigio piombo io non lascio che mi prenda
La nostalgia che sale lentamente come mai
Io penso a te mi chiedo adesso dove sei, cosa fai
Chissà se tu avrai mai pensato a me
Al nostro fuoco che bruciava e mo' è cenere
Ma tutto passa piano e pure se fa strano
Io sorrido perché so che oggi non ti chiamerò
Quel che viene venga e mi sta bene
Quel che è stato è già passato e mo' il passato se lo tiene
Piove già da un tot
La pioggia bagna la mia pelle ma mi asciugherò
Perché so che il tempo è ciclico
E so che un po' di tempo è quello che ci vuole
Mentre un guaglione sta scacciando il male, sta aspettando il sole

Oggi non c'è sole intorno a me 
Salvami, risplendi e scaldaci
Voglio il sole
Cerco nuova luce nella confusione di un guaglione 

E oggi è come ieri
Ma forse è un'impressione frutto della mente di un guaglione
Sarà che non c'è il sole
Sarà che tutto sembra resti uguale
Sarà quel che sarà, sono preso male
Ma nessuno chiama e non so chi chiamare
Cerco di schiodarmi e penso solo a quello che ho da fare
Uh, Gesù, sono io la vittima dei demoni
Che tornano e che vengono a tirarmi giù
I miei cattivi pensieri che mi aspettano braccano 
Parlano e parlano, dove sono i raggi che scaldavano un guaglione?
Dove sono gli altri della mia ballotta mo' che sono nel ciclone?
In dopa trovo la mia cura
In dopa mischio le radici e la cultura e ho energia pura
La musica mi detta le parole
Caccio queste rime e so che prima o poi ritorna il sole

Oggi non c'è sole intorno a me 
Salvami, risplendi e scaldami 
Voglio il sole
Cerco nuova luce nella confusione di un guaglione 

Vada come vada e va da sé
Conto solo su di me e già so che già sai che
Chico fa quel che s'ha da fare quando amore non c'è
Devo imbustare perché in tasca manca mone
Sempre più difficile restare calmo in questa situazione
Sclero, non ne voglio più
Parto da zero, so che in qualche modo devo andare su ma
Non c'è più luce, solo buio che fa male
Non c'è più pace solo rabbia che ogni giorno sale
So bene dove sono e adesso voglio stare qui
Sentire il beat, se sei all'ascolto vieni a prendermi
Rapiscimi, musica colpisci al cuore
Boom cha, boom cha, però non c'è dolore
Distendi le tue mani guaritrici su un guaglione
Mentre sta aspettando il sole, ayo

Oggi non c'è sole intorno a me

Voglio il sole

E mischiano speranze e realtà
Segnali che si perdono così
Un radar pronto quando chiude il cielo e noi
Colpevoli di troppa oscurità

Finché si può
Senti come tremo perchè sento
Che tutto finisce qui
Lasciati guardareun po' più a fondo 
Finché si può
Tienimi la mano perchè sento
Che tutto finisce qui

Nel letto della nostra intimità
A volte le parole si prosciugan

Lasciati guardare un po' più a fondo 
Finché si può

Che tutto finisce qui
Lasciati guardareun po' più a fondo 
Finché si può

Out of town were the people I knew

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there

Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""

Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
And you left me here on the wild side of life",The Wild Side of Life,

I guess it's over now
You don't need to worry
Everybody lets their guard down, sometimes

Daydream, while all the world moves on
Even if you hurry
There's a million others out there to find

Now that I'm in my head
I can see how bad
All the crazy boys, behave for you.

How can I be your friend
When I'm feeling dead.
All the thoughts I had, were bad for you

My name is quik & I be moving fast like a race car
But I'm top seed number one like the pace car
Whether you up on me or you chillin' way far
You can tell almost immediately that I'm aced off
So listen muthafucka why you comin' off hard
My objective is to catch you off guard
Get covert & infiltrate yo' clique
Crack yo' shit & mack yo' bitch
Now tell me could you conceive a nigga all up in her beaver
Givin' her the love fever for hours at a time before I take a breather
And when she tell me she loves me I don't believe her
'cause I rock in stereo or mono hot like gonno-
Rhea burnin' everytime you take a pee uh
So when you see a nigga out with his girl
Then baby play like you don't know me & we'll keep in a twirl
Because baby I go deeper than the deep blue seas
Baby do you really want to play the flute on me?
I'll give you a sack & take it back & you'll die to get it
Little punk 'cause I'm fly with it

I told her don't chase it but you can place it
In between your jaws to taste it
Or leave it in the basement
I be the riddler that's too familiar get in the middle of ya
And then I diddle ya, dick ya down 'til it tickles
Smack the booty with no pimples
Caress ya back then rub ya nipples
Baby I'm a crack fiend get the ky & if I'm at a jiggalo
Baby say hi fly like a eagle in a range rover or a regal
Lookin' for the party people & when I catch ya baby girl
You should feel lucky we can make love
But don't forget to fuck me
'cause you got more bounce than roger troutman
I don't know when it's in or out and
Soak me baby give me that good thang
Ain't nothin' wrong with a coochie bang

If you really wanna change the game let me hear ya say 'ohh yeah'
Haha, I just had to do that once
Ay, t-p-t style

Jumpin up outta the burb', park mode
And 18 inches from the curb
While I'm smellin them stanky stenches from the herb
Red-eyed flight, and I'm lookin for my red-eyed homie
Black tone, 'cause I said I might
Just hafta pass through, and let 'em hear some shit that's pretty fat
From spade ty to king tee, this is where it's at
Nigga, makin million dollar deals at a checker table
And my nephews gonna be the youngest niggas with a record label
I'm the only nigga that promised to show up
With more talent than any nigga and I didn't wanna blow up
I shine like glitter 'cause I'm natural
If on the first night I hit, then that's a hoe

You want to rumble, chuck em around with the superb

And this bullet goes out to niggas bitin' my name
Thought it was subliminal, but real doggs recognize them thangs
That's why your chronic bout to change the game

With my fists cocked back, and ready for combat
And hit ya, with six blows to ya cranium
I'm the dime nigga
Fuck this rap hunch niggas, I'm gainin' em
It's the Y2K, but the glitch is in this bitch niggas

I'm still sportin' gray jeans with the black and white Polo's
With the chucks cut lo do's
Niggas thought that I was goin' Hollywood
After rhythmalism
But all that taught me was to keep it realism
Give a pound to my real thugs
Use a jimmy when I fuck a bitch
Stay away from unknown drugs
But unlike y'all, bitch made, don't know where you from
Lyin' on your records about niggas you done
Fuck what happened to Cavaricci jeans and backpacks
Where you get them khakis and that dog patch
You ain't no gangsta
You only get in to fit in
Take yo ass to the circus with your family and friends
'cause i'm too rough, too (?), too rugged for y'all kind

Put me up on game, your homie
It was too much fun, hm, remember what you told me

No baby I ain't with the bullshit
I been fuckin you for two weeks and I ain't seen no cashflow increase
You've been runnin your mouth, tellin your girls how I'm fuckin you
What I got in my house, the things I don't do for you
Better be careful cause your girls wanna come too
Yay kiss and a rub back and now I'm up in you
And did you tell Tamika
I was wondering why my homie baby momma was blowing up my beeper
You's a cold thang, I told you keep it on the DL
And if I decide to hit it again it's at the motel
Tellin them broads about my furniture and jewels
Work on my table and how holding my clientel
Damn do it hit the spot
As pretty as you is no more blessins for your trot
But I might for the sake of my swipe
Hit it like it's supposed to be hit if the vibe is right tonight

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Ain't no big deal until that hoe squeals
Now I got to keep my fuckin woman from around that hoe
Take a fuckin rubber everywhere that I go
Keep her from her family cause her cousin know
She say she fuckin Nate but she can't prove it though
Next time you can't come if you got a loud tongue
I know I got a big dick, shouldn't loaned it to a trick
This time you act like a nigga who just did a crime
You got your ass busted now you facing time
The money's in the pack, it's on the drivers side
But nigga you was with it so when you be quiet
Now you facin twenty all by yourself

Products of a revolution that we begun (yeah)
Make me want to split a swisher, I need me one

I know you like my shoes, cause you walk in my shoes
And would you be prepared to see (would ya?)
A life full of money and a life full of girls
But a heart that's really in deep (feel my pain)
A lot of people yellin (""we love ya Timbaland"")
But I know why'all really in need (ooo)

Pain, can't you see the pain in my eyes?
The lie behind my cries, don't you sympathize with me
You don't have to wonder when I come
You label me a bum, you fake it ain't suprisin me (yeah)
Funny how Oo got money, people come around
Soon as Oo fail, kick 'em to the ground (yeah)
Not just neighbors, the whole damn town
Own flesh and blood, said I was a clown
But as the world turns, my life can too
And like a gun kills, a knife can too (yeah)
I was stabbed thrice, how 'bout you?
Once by my mom, pops the other two
Child abuse kid, ward of the state
I know it was the past, but I just can't shake
How you had a kid, beat me like a slave
I was only three, how could I misbehave?
I didn't know better, you could teach me first
You said fuck that, then you beat me worse
It's pain in this verse, hard to go on (yeah)
Oo is a man, so I must hold on

Put it back on the project bench

I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me,
Death row Jamaicans murder your family
Fuck what happens tonight,
Fuck what happens tonight
Fuck what happens tonight,
I've got my gun on me

It was murder she wrote, your name in blood
When the love's gone,
Your eyes diluted full of blood
Six cars full of goons, six blocks heard the boom
Dreadlocks, middle of June, head shots, get tombed
Stone, ten shots, five gone, 9/11 dial tone
You want it all, die alone
A war's going on nobody's safe from
Now we're talking to the judge when your day come
Like it was hard not to kill these niggas
It was like a full-time job not to kill these niggas
Eight figures, need the eight story mansion
While I'm strapped up
Two-stepping with the devil dancing
Diluted with blood in my eyes
Like a stillborn,
Niggas won't make it out alive, nigga

Fuck it, I'm ready to die tonight
Put it on momma that clip in the back, and I loaded it twice
Just a call away, my niggas is ready, no matter the price
Playing with mine,
You niggas could get it including your wife
Isn't life a motherfucker?
Since seventeen that pistol's been my blood brother
Sleeping with that lethal weapon, playing Danny Glover
AK40, hold a hundred if we're talking numbers
Riders' fucking with mobsters
Niggas want beef? Turn them to pasta
Load up the clip, shoot up your master
Bang bang, bless them father
Passed beside him, rest aside a lake
That's swimming with snakes inside
And look at my eyes, I hate disguises
Knife or gun, I compromise it
Oh Lord, I'm a ride on my enemies
If I die tonight, I bet them gangsters remember me
Nigga, until then

I got my gun on me,

Fucking streets on me,
Death row Jamaicans murder your family
Fuck what happens tonight,
Fuck what happens tonight
Fuck what happens tonight,

From the depths of the sea, back to the block
With a bitch on my dick and a bottle of Ciroc
Tick tock, non-stop, blocker, blocker, blood clot
Don't test the lion
'Cause you'll get dropped on the spot
Lick shot, drip drop on soil
Pot's hot until it boils
To this Crip shit, I'm loyal
Dip with us, ride with us,
Slide with us, slip with us
Sit with us, slick with us,
This bad little bitch wanna get with us
Say she likes the French tip nails that I wear
And how I'm so pimped out
With dreads in my hair, yeah

Body laid out stiff full of stab wounds
I told this nigga I was coming back
Pussy must not have heard me when I told him that
Nigga, it's eye for an eye
A life for a life, a body for a price
I want to smell his last breath took
And look him in his eyes and make for sure he knows how death looks
Because I'm him, it's in the air, I can feel it
Shot him four times with the gun I was concealing
Over killing, it ain't no coming back from it
Then walked away with a demeanour
Like I just done it
Something evil this way's coming
For big face hundreds this bitch gets punished

Five shots to the stomach, 2Pac gift pack
It's death row, conspiracy theories
Concealed indictments handed to the grand jury
Get some money now, you hated by your own kind
The home invasion done by niggas in your bloodline
GABOS, game ain’t based on sympathy

I'm like Farrakhan, in view of hundreds of Jews

A place where I think somebody's been playing Jumanji.
A Manor where man are like animals,
An' they'll yam on you like they yam on food.
Cats with claws that'll stab a yout', act bad an' catch a slap or two.
We don't applaud success, all we clap are tools.
London ain't cool to cruise through where the hunters pray,
Looking lunch today,
And your chains looking like fresh fruit to a hungry ape.
They'll eat on you, then laugh about it like Hyenas do,
So stick to breezing through, like cheeta's do or be a piece of food.

Got kids with sticks and knifes here.
It's hype here, we know no different prick;
It's just life here, life the way we know from young the way we're shown.
Stacked trapped in flats where our front doors don't face the road.
God CID spinning round in cars, shifting criminals at large, it's hard,
Not to think the bits are just a bing without the bars.
Jealousy's what the cheddar brings, for the cheddar it's anything goes,
Low enough to rob newly weds for their wedding rings
Everyday is warring, never give a warning,
Violence is the only way you settle things, everyday is hating,
Money that I'm making, jealous 'cause I'm moving on to better things,
Everyday is fighting, rolling in the night now.
All you do is watch everyone else get far, you say that life is hard

You always gave me something
The way you made me feel before you left
See you're jadin' me, dazin' me
And I just wasn't ready, cash on, walk out on today

Oh, let me go, you let me down

The safest place for hiding

I always end up on this road

'93, I was a three year old with many schemes
Junior playing football skills of Arsenal just like they call me
Sticker books remember wrestling the young'n takin' I was phased
Used to idolize when he gave you a break-up
I was in a nursery making story cakes, fell in love
For the first time I remember days
When I was bullied, beat up, then kicked and slapped away
Clutching on the monkey bars and hoping they'd all go away
Loved them city sounds and sirens in the dark at night
Helicopters fly above my head, I'd never get a fright

I was scared of startin' school again; will some be all rude again?
Beat me up and treat me like a fool again.
The green emerald a thousand welcomes negative,
Growin' up a ? an outsider never settled quick
Settling was hard when you're treated like a lump of shit
Saying you were black and tan and come for what you fucking did

Fantastic, look at the dune field

","The Red Weed, Pt. 2",2012
Maverick Sabre,"I suddenly noticed the body of a parson lying on the ground in a ruined churchyard
I felt unable to leave him to the mercy of the red weed, and decided to bury him, decently

Nathaniel! Nathaniel!

The parson's eyes flickered open
He was alive!

Nathaniel, I saw the church burst into flame, are you all right?

Don't touch me!

But it's me, Beth! Your wife!

No! You're one of them - a devil!

He's delirious!

Lies! I saw the devil's sign!

What are you saying?

The green flash in the sky
His demons were here all along, in our hearts and souls
Just waiting for a sign from Him
And now they're destroying our world!

But they're not devils, they're Martians

We must leave here!

Look, a house still standing, come Nathaniel, quickly

We took shelter in a cottage, and black smoke spread, hemming us in
Then a fighting machine came across the field
Spraying jets of steam that turned the smoke into thick, black dust

Ulla!

Dear God, help us!

The voice of the Devil is heard in our land!

Listen, do you hear them drawing near
In their search for the sinners?
Feeding on the power of our fear
And the evil within us?
Incarnation of Satan's creation of all that we dread
When the demons arrive those alive would be better off dead!

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for!
And if one man can stand tall
There must be hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Once there was a time when I believed
Without hesitation
That the power of love and truth could conquer all
In the name of salvation
Tell me what kind of weapon is love when it comes to the fight?
And just how much protection is truth against all Satan's might?

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for
And if one man can stand tall
There must be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

People loved you, and trusted you, came to you for help

Didn't I warn them this would happen?
Be on your guard, I said, for the Evil One never rests
I said exorcise the devil!
But no, they wouldn't listen, the demons inside them grew and grew
Until Satan gave his signal and destroyed the world we knew!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Now darkness has descended on our land
And all your prayers cannot save us
Like fools we've let the devil take command
Of the souls that God gave us
To the altar of evil like lambs to the slaughter were led
When the demons arrive the survivors will envy the dead!

There must be something worth living for
(No, there is nothing!)
There must be something worth trying for
(I don't believe it's so!)
Even some things worth dying for
If just one man could stand tall
There would be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Forget about goodness and mercy, they're gone!

Didn't I warn them? Pray, I said! Destroy the devil, I said!
They wouldn't listen! I could have saved the world!
But now it's too late, too late!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Dear God!
A cylinder's landed on the house
And we are underneath it, in the pit!

The Martians spent the night making a new machine
It was a squat, metallic spider with huge, articulated claws
But it, too, had a hood in which a Martian sat
I watched it pursuing some people across a field
It caught them nimbly and tossed them into a great metal basket upon its back

Beth! She's dead! Buried under the rubble Why?
Satan! Why did you take one of your own?

There is a curse on Mankind
We may as well be resigned
To let the devil, the devil take the spirit of man

As time passed in our dark and dusty prison
The Parson wrestled endlessly with his doubts
His outcries invited death for us both - and yet, I pitied him",The Spirit of Man,2012
Maverick Sabre,"I want these streets an answer
So I keep calling heaven
Meant to be back home with you
My shining star, you got me
Miss like limbo inside me
Will you wait, I won't be long

I won't let, I won't keep anything
Hold me back from you
I'm telling the
Truth I'm promise you
I'll be there soon

I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home to you

These days grow long and weary
And it takes it's toll, I'm dreary
Smell your fragnance in the air
So close I'm weak and tired
Was lost but now I found it
Hear your voice get loud and keep

I won't let, I won't keep anything
Hold me back from you

Coming home
And I'll be back before you wake
See I'll be back before you wake, darling
And I'll be back before you wake
When I'm near you I'm alive
When I feel your love I fly
What I need is you and I
I'll be there soon

Coming home",Coming Home,2014
Maverick Sabre,"Face down on my chest
Wake up and you are there
Your touch takes my tears
But I'm lying here wondering if you are sincere

I pray that what you give me is real
I hate that it's the way I feel
Nothing seems to care for me to see

And I can't drink for love with you
If I can't recognize the truth
I watch you as you rest
I'm so confused

'Cause I don't wanna be used darling it's too hard on me
And I don't know what to do darling but choose honesty
And I don't wanna be used darling it's too hard on me
And I don't know what to do darling but choose honesty

[?]
And your smile as you're fast asleep
My fears tell me to go
But as you're whispering in my ears [?]
So I don't

I pray that what you give me is real
I hate that it's the way I feel
But nothing seems to care for me to see

But I don't wanna be used darling it's too hard on me
And I don't know what to do darling but choose honesty
And I don't wanna be used darling it's too hard on me
And I don't know what to do darling but choose honesty

Oh please darling don't use me
Please darling don't use me
Oh please darling don't use me

So I don't know how I can take it
And I don't know how I can make it
And I don't know how I can take it
And I don't know how I can make it

Please darling don't
Please darling don't",Hard on Me,2014
Maverick Sabre,"They say you can't love and be wise, but I can pretend
With you, if suddenly I ever have to surrender you
I'd fall in a heap, I'd fall on the floor
And crawl on all fours, for you I'd fall on my sword
If grief ever darkened my door, you'd light it up
The way you brighten up a room hits me right in the chest
It puts the breath inside of my lungs
It's like I lept in the light of the sun
And in spite of my weary frown
You wear a smile that wears me down
So hear me out, I know that I wasted time
When I should've been replacing your last name with mine
And that mistake is mine, believe me
I wear it like a sunburn, it might disappear but it won't leave me
I'll carry you on my shoulders, never set you down
Ferry you through the coldness, never let you down

I won't let you down, won't let you down again
I won't let you down, won't let you down again

Travelling man in the back of a van
Capturing sands like time through the back of my hand
If I could hold her for a moment, do a lap of this land
I'd console you for a moment, then be back in a glance
But I'm so far since we left for the road
Chicks I've seen around the heavens and globe
Searching for the next episode
Problem is, in letting it go
Be like letting go of everything you treasure and know
And whenever I go, I think my chest will explode
No matter where your heart at, brain leaves death in the crew
Try and understand, where I lay my head is my home
And I was in love, before this rap shit was ever in vogue
But if you feel that you're ever alone
While standing in the same room as me
Let's set it in stone
You can't save me, acquainted to this devilish road
But you're bravely willing to give a hell of a go
So

I won't let you down, won't let you down again
I won't let you down, won't let you down again

I hate that I was wasted your touch, your taste
My shame, can't change, want you to remain
My angel, my heartbeat, come closer, I'm sorry
My soul is, yours truly, you know this

And you know that I
Won't be shy, talking bout what you're giving me
Conflict diamond, you shine through the misery
You walk in a room and light it up, that's just with your entry
You walk in a room and light it up, like it was four twenty
Some people never find out what they have
Only ever find out what they had
And I could've been one of them, don't know if I still won't
And that thought hangs around my neck like a millstone
For real though, it's like I lost you, left you, let you go
Before I got to get you, or let you know
That you're my refuge and I need you to see
The only one I let down more than you is me

And I won't let you down, and I won't let you down
I won't let you down, won't let you down again
I won't let you down, I won't let you down again",Won't Let You Down,2014
Maverick Sabre,"My mind just booked a first class ticket to my destiny by the way
Yeah

Maybe I'mma fly away
Maybe I'mma fly away, some day

So gullible just like my first love
Stay humble, but I knew that I was first up
Picked up the pen and that's when I drew my first blood
Spit my heart again, cause the pain'll never end
Happiness is temporary, always has been
I just lost one, but sometimes I win
I always spread love, but sometimes I sin
I only trust some, that’s why I keep a few friends
Funny cause I used to see my circle never end
Always kept like 47 friends in my circle of friends
All that’s left now is the radiance
They still here, trying to find love on this atmosphere
Things get severe for everybody, everywhere
This is my moment of truth, right here
Swear I ain't scared of no man
I see the omens
I pick 'em up and keep it rollin'
The omnipresence is omnipotent
But I keep going, 'til it’s all said and done
I show all my soul purpose but I’m pretty sure there's one
There’s a reason why I’ve come, new season's just begun
This the death of a psychopomp but a birth of God's son

Don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zone
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on

On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on

I had a dream I seen my name on the gravel stone
And read here lies a G followed by a poem
I couldn't see the words but I'm sure what's in his own
Funny that I write most when I know my feeling's wrong
With both shoulders that my head is always on
I trudge through harm's way with heavy boulders on my arm
I feel strong as I walk through the many storms that
Rain on my parade, seen the dust cry for days
I'm feeling like a young prince, I'm drinking today
My name ring bells all the way to heaven's gate
Though STEEZy told about me, yo I know he always watching
I guess there really is a heaven for us hip hoppers
I really miss my partner
But I know he with Big Poppa, 2 Pacs, and the big L rolled proper
And that's a big pun, know that I'mma join him
When my time come, but the story just begun, so

Don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zone
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on

On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on

One day I'mma fly away
One day I'mma fly away (fly away, fly away)
One day you will fly away (fly away, fly away)
One day we will fly away (fly away, fly away)

My clouds grey, I hope my pain don’t show
Looking in the sky I wonder where them rainbows go
They say that if we reign, them pot-of-gold’s will show
Even skating down the block don’t feel the same no more
If I ain’t looking, I still see it all
My vision’s jaded, too much bitches rubbed the crystal balls
They stay scheming, y’all like the sheep to the shepherd
The trees to the leaves, you needed but not needed
So I work alone, lone wolf, stay creeping
I'd rather hunt on my own then be owned and not eating
I’m not eatin’, not blamin’, I’m just sayin’
Go to bed with hunger pains while these other niggas caking, they too fake
No rappers rapping for years waiting 'round for that big break
Break a arm, break a bond before I go break the bank
Break a hundred, that's fifty-fifty
Long as rolling and Whitney's seen different cities, different titties
I bring no money with me, I'm on my grind man, no regrets when I die man
'Til we fly man, 'til we fly man, 'til we fly man
You gon' miss us when we fly man

Don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zone
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on

On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on

One day I'mma fly away (fly away, fly away)
One day you will fly away (fly away, fly away)
One day we will fly away (fly away, fly away)",On and On,2015

Separation's mad, 'cause we don't even talk no more 
You don't even cross my mind
Really that's sad 'cause I was on the bedroom floor waiting for the PS3 pad
I remember the smell, you was trying to make man blaze
Them times I was way too young
Nobody could tell, but deep down I was just following you like you was the one
You remember the creps? 110s we used to call them, yours were the baddest on road
Them days were the best, free as a bird pedalling from postcode to postcode
Reaching speeds on a Mongoose Pro, playing grime beats on a stolen phone
I remember the Samsung D500 with the little speaker on, it was cold
20 man deep, bare different emcee names, everybody had bars
Do you remember the Toyota Corolla, bare different stolen cars
Even the dog's nickname was Bullet, because it was leaving holes in necks
And you got hench and had man feeling weak Samson with no dreads
We don't talk no more but that's fine
Please tell your mum I said hi
Them days are gone and they're never gonna come back
We're older now and that's life
No disrespect, back then you was on top and it felt like you was the guy

Back then you was wham, what are you about 6'2""
You made man feel so small
Back then the Nokia never stopped ringing it was like phone call after phone call
18 ounces in the holdall, to me it was full of dust
I would watch you cook until it turned into a golf ball
Then you'd break it up into little rocks and we'd hit the road until dawn
Still don't know how we never got caught
I thought we wore the balli to stay warm
But when I look back you was just on form
When we'd go Milkshake, that was the flex
Over the road for chicken and chips
And you had some of the waviest old school Nike jackets I'd ever seen in the bits
You kept elastic bands on your wrist
And you told me to keep stacks in thousands
I remember the night that we kept counting and we must have stopped at about 26
And the time that we dug up the ting, you wanted me to let it bang and it jammed
When I look back, the ting was rusty and it probably could have blown off man's hand
We don't talk much now and it's strange
I hope your mum's okay

Mavis Rivers,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

 The moonlight on the lake

 The Kewpie dolls we won
 The bell I (you) rang to prove that I was 
 (you were) strong
 The things we did last summer 
 I'll remember all winter long
 The early morning hike
 The rented tandem bike
 The lunches that we used to pack

Mavis Rivers,"What good are words I say to you?
They can't convey to you what's in my heart
If you could hear
Instead
The things I've left unsaid

Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

So lucky to be
The one you run to see
In the evening, when the day is through

I only know what I
Know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new

And time after time
You'll hear
Me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

Crossword solved 
Words go up words come down 
Forwards backwards twisted round 
He grabs a pile of letters from a small suitcase 
Disappears into an office 
It's another working day 

And his thoughts are full of strangers 
Corridors of naked lights 
And his mind once full of reason 
Now there's more than meets the eye 
Oh, a stranger's face he carries with him 
He likes a bit of reading on the subway home 

A distant radio whistling tunes that nobody knows 
At home a house awaits him, He unlocks the door 
Thinking once there was a sea here 
But there never was a door 
And his thoughts are full of strangers 
And his eyes to numb to see 
And nothing that he knows of 

And nowhere where he's been 
Was ever quite like this 
And his thoughts
And at heart 
He's full of strangers 
Dodging on his train of thought

Naive in every way
Every schoolboy's fantasy she was
That's why he had to wait
If he poured his heart into a glass
And offered it like wine
She could drink and be back in time for the morning papers
They could take a walk down the ocean side
Make a wish on every wave
They could find a carousel
And ride or kiss in every cave
They could contemplate the entire universe
Or just one star
Or just how far was the walk for the morning papers

Let me play it for you one time, oh oh
Well
Hey
Shucks

Why is age more than a number when it comes to love?
Should we ask the ones who speculate
When they don't know what it's made of?
Should we ask the moonlight on your face
Or the raindrops in your hair
Or should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?
