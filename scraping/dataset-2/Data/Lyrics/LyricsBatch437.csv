Jim Ed Brown,"(It's the Streamlined Cannonball)
A long steel rail a short crosstie I'm on my way back home
I'm on a train the king of them all the Streamlined Cannonball
She moves along like a cannonball like a star in its heavenly flight
This lonesome sound from the whistle you love as she travels through the night

Her headlight gleams out in the night her firebox flash you see
The blinds I ride the lights that I love it's home sweet home to me
She moves along like a cannonball",Streamlined Cannonball,1960
Jim Ed Brown,"There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees half forlorn
And there on a sunny morning
Little Jimmy Brown was born (Bung, bung, bung, bung)

All the chapel bells were ringing 
In the little valley town
And the song that they were singing 
Was for baby Jimmy Brown

Then the little congregation 
Prayed for guidance from above
""Lead us not into temptation,
Bless this hour of meditation,
Guide him with eternal love""

There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Beneath the mountains high above
And there, twenty years thereafter
Jimmy was to meet his love (Bung, bung, bung, bung)

All the chapel bells were ringing
'Twas a great day in his life
'Cause the songs that they were singing 
Was for Jimmy and his wife

Then the little congregation 
Prayed for guidance from above
""Lead us not into temptation,
Bless, oh Lord this celebration,
May their lives be filled with love""

From the village hidden deep in the valley
One rainy morning dark and gray
A soul winged its way to heaven
Jimmy Brown had passed away (Bung, bung, bung, bung)

Just a lonely bell was ringing 
In the little valley town
'Twas farewell that it was singing 
To our good ol' Jimmy Brown (little Jimmy Brown)

And the little congregation 
Prayed for guidance from above
""Lead us not into temptation, 
May his soul find the salvation,
Of thy great eternal love""",Three Bells (Les Trois Cloches),1960

Which way is best for me I wish I knew
To see or not to see the things you do

And if I've met someone who thrills me so
Well I finally met a girl who turns me inside out
I'll tell you about her for you ought to know
You comb her hair every morning 
and make sure she dresses just right
You comb her hair every morning 
and put her to bed every night

I stammer and I walk right into doors
And just to hold her hand in mine makes me feel weak
You know her for she's a friend of yours
You comb her hair every morning",You Comb Her Hair,1966

Jim Ed Brown,"(Gunfighter) Marta woke me up that night and she began to cry
She tried to tell me once before about another guy
She held a letter in her hand her body shook with fear
The man she left so long ago at last was riding here
Next day the dark eyed stranger came and called me to the yard
I'd picked up my rusty gun my blood was pounding hard
He said it let me ride away if I give up my wife
But if I chose to stay in draw it have to take my life
Gunfighter who is wrong or right
The man who fights to love or the man who loves to fight

I didn't want to fight the man and I didn't want to run
But slowly he began to count and I went for my gun
Then out of whip his hand lashed out so quick I couldn't see
Before I even touched my gun his bullet burdened me
I felt my strength go leaking out my eyelids turned to red
I watched him aimed the second shot directly at my head
Just then I heard my Marta say gunfigter turn around
She raised my shotgun to her whip and blew him off to ground
Gunfighter who is wrong or right...
Gunfighter who is wrong or right...




",Gunfighter,1967
Jim Ed Brown,"I should break these habits before very long like calling to see if you're home
But my hand just can't help reaching out for the phone it doesn't know any better
I've cautioned my heart not to hope anymore that you won't be around like before
Still it stops every time there's a knock on your door it doesn't know any better

I still can't believe that you're gone though I've tried
My senses got lost in the turmoil inside
And my love keeps raging though your love has died it doesn't know any better
And my life goes on there's just one reason why it doesn't know any better",It Doesn't Know Any Better,1967
Jim Ed Brown,"Living on free food tickets,
Water in the milk from the hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can you do hm.
Tears from your little sister crying 
Because she doesn't have a dress without a patch 
For the party to go,but you know she'll get by

Cause she's living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can
And she can

It's a good thing you don't have a bus fare
Or it would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it on the snow on the ground
You gotta walk into town to find a job
Trying to keep your hands warm
When the hole in your shoes let the snow come through
And chill you to the bone, so now you better go home where it's warm

Where you can live in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can
And she can

Living on dreams ain't easy
But the closer the knit the tighter the knit and the chills stay away
You keep 'em in stride for family pride
You know that faith is your foundation but with a whole lot a love
And a warm conversation and don't forget to pray
Making you strong where you belong

And we live in the love of the common people

Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can

Cause when this party's through I've got plans for you

Never let me go
Until you've told me, told me
What I want to know
And just hold me, hold me
Make me tell you I'm in love with you
(Hold me tight, never let me go)
Thrill me, thrill me
Walk me down the lane where shadows will be, will be
Hiding lovers just the same as we'll be, we'll be
When you make me tell you I love you
(Will you take me in your arms)

Don't be fooled thinking this is the last you'll find""

Jim Ed Brown,"Saw you there on the bar stool as I walked in
And the look we gave each other said we both need a friend
Is this the first time you've come here in all the nights you've been alone
Searching for something that just isn't at home
How long has it been when's the last time he kissed you
My you sure look lovely in that dress so tight and thin
There's a look in your eye that cries somebody love me
And I wonder how long has it been

I sat down at your table and we shared a drink or two
All the things that first look told me now I find are really true
Someone's neglect has left an emptiness where love used to be
Then you reached out and touched my hand softly whispered to me
How long has it been when's the last time she held you
And made you feel wanted and needed and loved
There's a look in your eye that cries somebody love me
And I wonder how long has it been",How Long Has It Been,1967

I hear footsteps slowly walking as they gently walk across a lonely floor
And a voice is softly saying darling this will be goodbye forever more
There goes my reason for living there goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession there goes my everything

It's your happiness that matters most of all

Though it hurts to let you go darling I want you to know
That I'll stand by you if ever you should call
And if I should ever hear that he made you shed a tear
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls

I found myself wanting to kiss her

And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""

But by day I make the cars by night I make the bars

And after all these years I find I've just been wastin' my time

Jim Ed Brown,"It's just knowing that your door is always open and your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shacked by forgotten words and bons
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be planted on their columns now that binds me
Or something that somebody said because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheet fields and the clothes lines
And the junk yards and the highways come between us
And some other woman cryin' to her mother cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walking on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind
I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurgling crackling caltron in some train yard
My beard a roughen coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands round a tin can I pretend I hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
Ever smiling ever gentle on my mind

Jim Ed Brown,"Out in the west Texas town of El Paso I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Feleena would whirl
Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden I was in love but in vain I could tell
One night a wild young cowboy came in wild as the west Texas wind
Dashing and daring a drink he was sharing with wicked Feleena the girl that I loved
So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down with his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenege was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young strager lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence shocked by the foul deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance that was to run
Out through the backdoor of Rosa's I ran out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one it looked like it could run up on its back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I could from the west Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless everything's gone in life nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death
I saddled up and away I did go riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet will find me tonight nothin's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward down off the hill to Feleena I go
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting I can't let them catch me I have to make it to Rosa's backdoor
Something is dreadfuly wrong for I feel a deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle I'm getting weary unable to ride
But my love for Feleena is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary I can's stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle I feel the bullet go deep in my chest
From out of nowhere Feleena has found me kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for one little kiss then Feleena goodbye

She lived in the house next door her nose was pressed against the window pane
When I looked at her she smiled and showed a place where two teeth used to be
And I heard her ask her mom if she could come outside and play with me
Soon the days of sand and shovels gave way to the mysteries of life
Then I noticed she was changing and I looked at her through different eyes
We became as one and knew a love without beginning or an end
And everyday I lived with her was like a new day dawning once again
And I've loved her since every doll was Shirley Temple soda pop was still a nickel
Jam was on her fingertips milk was circled on her lips
After many years our love grew silent and at night I heard her cry
And when she left me in the fall I knew that this would be our last goodbye
I was man enough to give her everything she needed for a while
But in searching for a perfect love I found that I could not give her a child
Now she lives a quiet life and is a mother of a little girl
And every time I pass her house my thoughts go back into another world
Cause I see her little girl her nose is pressed against the window pane

You feel your lover must be near

But till the day he seems that song the angels play
Because I love you so oh let me stay close to you close to you close to you
For maybe I am just a sentimental guy whose heart believes as time goes by

And hold me just the way I dream you do close to you close to you",Close,1972
Jim Ed Brown,"Lying here beside you in the shadows with your body close to mine
I can't help but wish that I could have you here beside me all the time
Knowing that I cannot keep you from your going when the day is done
Makes me wish that I was tall enough to reach the sky and stop the sun
But I can see the evening shadows slipping silent cross the floor
And I curse the day for coming to an end
You'll fix your face comb your hair and leave my arms once more
But when tomorrow comes we'll watch the evening shadows fall again
[ piano ]
When we're here together I don't question why you came or why you go
I'm sure you have your reasons but your being here is all I have to know
Knowing when you come to me there's nothing I can do to make you stay
Just like all the other times you'll leave me at the ending of the day
But I can see the evening shadows...

They were a comfort to me when I was alone
The dancing stops but the music goes on
Doggone my soul how I love them old songs
Oh when I hear that double eagle guitar
It makes me think how trouble free girl we are
There was a time I spent my nights in a bar
Playing that old jukebox until the honky tonky locked up

Doggone my mind just won't leave me alone
Keeps on reminding me I'm so far from home
Those heart breaking aching eggs and bacon country songs
They take me back to hardwood floors out door johns and mason jars

Through my window I see him going down the street and he don't know

Now the Bourbon Street lady sleeps like a baby in the shadows
She was new to me full of mystery but now I know
She's much more to me than just a girl in the room for love in the hot afternoon

Lines that tell the story of a life with me that seemed too few good times
All I've been to you is a thorn to me you've been a rose

Jim Ed Brown,"I heard from a mem'ry last night from the girl who is still in my heart
She's the one girl I've met I could never forget even though we had drifted apart
I heard from a mem'ry last night and she promised to meet me today
And I'll tell her when she's in my arms again that this time she'll have to stay

Yes I heard from an old flame last night from an angel I had heard
And I'd never thought I'd hear from her when she said hello
Just that one word said as much as a thousand could have
Cause the way she said it I knew she had forgave me
I heard from a mem'ry last night",I Heard from a Memory Last Night,2002
Jim Ed Brown,"All night long I tried to sleep but sleep refused to come
Cause today I knew I'd either have to fight or run
Knowin' if I choose to run my mind would never rest
Cause with so much pride I wear this badge upon my vest

Folks are filled with fear because there's three bad guns in town
Sheriff Olsen made the wrong move and they shot him down
One they called Dakota Jack and one El Paso Red
The other just turned twenty and he's called the Killer Kid

Good advice I get and that's to leave and run away
But my pride and badge I wear won't let me live this way
And if I stay the three have bragged they'll add me to their list
But I have a different aim and I don't aim to miss

From the doorway where I stand I see the outlaws three
Worried none because they know the town's not helpin' me
From a hundred yards away I try a lucky shot
Luck is with me and Dakota Jack dies on the spot

Well a kid runs through the barroom door and Red goes up the stairs
The Kid is ragin' mad, he's breakin' bottles, kickin' chairs
And from a roof El Paso Red has vowed to pay me back
As he views the lifeless body of Dakota Jack

I can see him as he jumps from one roof to the next
Searchin' for me but he has no idea where I'm at
But I watch his every move I'm ready when he leaps
As I shoot him in mid air he crashes to the street

Now there's one against just one I've evened up the score
Down the street I hear a yell come through the barroom door
The Kid has screamed, there's no way I can live unless I run
Said there ain't no lawdog man enough to take his gun

Through the barroom door he walks and steps out on the street
I can't match his draw, he's much too fast for me to beat
And as I walk toward him we both grab a forty-five
Maybe I will die today and he will stay alive

Like a hammer somethin' hits me spinnin' me around
As I fall I shoot him twice before he hits the ground
His bullet missed me , still I feel a burnin' in my chest
His bullet hits the badge I wear with pride upon my vest

As the people view the bodies of the lifeless three
From their looks I know exactly what they think of me
To them I'm just a killer and they could not care less
'Bout my pride or 'bout the badge I wear upon my vest

Jim Ed Brown,"There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees half forlorn
And there on a sunny morning
Little Jimmy Brown was born

All the chapel bells were ringing
In the little valley town
And the songs that they were singing
Was for baby Jimmy Brown

And the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
Bless this hour of meditation
Guide him with eternal love

From the village hidden deep in the valley
One rainy morning dark and gray
A soul went its way to heaven
Jimmy Brown had passed away

Just the lonely bell was ringing
In the little valley town
Twas there will that it was singing
To our good old Jimmy Brown

And the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
May his soul find the salvation
Of Thy great eternal love

She tried to tell me once before about another guy
She held a letter in her hand her body shook with fear
The man she left so long ago at last was riding here
Next day the dark eyed stranger came and called me to the yard
I'd picked up my rusty gun my blood was pounding hard
He said it let me ride away if I give up my wife
But if I chose to stay in draw it have to take my life
Gunfighter who is wrong or right
The man who fights to love or the man who loves to fight

I didn't want to fight the man and I didn't want to run
But slowly he began to count and I went for my gun
Then out of whip his hand lashed out so quick I couldn't see
Before I even touched my gun his bullet burdened me
I felt my strength go leaking out my eyelids turned to red
I watched him aimed the second shot directly at my head
Just then I heard my Marta say gunfigter turn around
She raised my shotgun to her whip and blew him off to ground

Now I know exactly who I am and what I'm here for
And I will go sailing no more

All the things I thought I'd be, all the brave things I'd done
Vanished like a snowflake with the rising of the sun
Never more to sail my ship, where no man has gone before
And I will go sailing no more

But no, it can't be true I could fly if I wanted to
Like a bird in the sky if I believe I can fly, why I'd fly
Clearly, I will go sailing, no more",I Will Go Sailing No More,1997
Jim Ford,"I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you've broke my heart,
And as the door of love between us closes,
Tears will fall like pedals when we part.

I begged you to be different but you've always been untrue,
I'm tired of forgiving and there is nothing left to do,
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you broke my heart.

You've made our lovers lane a road of sorrow,
'Til at last we had to say goodbye,
You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow,
With a heart that you taught how to cry.

I know that I should hate you after all you've put me through,
But how can I be bitter when I'm still in love with you,
I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you've broke my heart",Bouquet of Roses,2008
Jim Fox,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

Jim Fox,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint
I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

Jim Gaffigan,"You pulled up and parked your El Dorado
We said ""hi"" and kissed with some bravado
I got out my camera and was laughing
Happy it was you I'm photographing

And we drove to the ferry
Like the cat and canary
I said, ""Baby, it's scary
When it's so beautiful

Why does it hurt me
To feel so much tenderness?
Beautiful
You little wonder, you""

Maybe then I held your hand and kissed you
I know once I just hauled off and hit you

'Cause I can't even stand it
'Cause I don't want to end it
To be perfectly candid ?
Baby, you're beautiful

Sometimes it hurts me
To feel so much tenderness
Beautiful
Wish you could see it, too

And all I have to do today
Is make you happy
The only thing you have to say
Is, ""It's all lovely, baby""

Late that night, we checked into the Bellevue
Held you close, but, baby ? couldn't tell you

And we stayed in our Calvin's
And we swore we'd be best friends
And I looked through the zoom lens
And thought you were beautiful

Sometimes it hurts me
To feel so much tenderness
Beautiful
Baby, I'm dazzled
By the view

You don't need to tell me
I'm completely powerless

I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.

But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.

And you'll be met there by others like you

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;

When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat

While we sleep, sleep, sleep
It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep

Wishing is good time wasted,
Still it's a habit they say,
Wishing for sweet's I've tasted,
That's all I do all day.
Maybe there's nothing in wishing,
But, speaking of wishing I'll say,

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

When the morning glories
Twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early
In the morning.

Butterflies all flutter up
And kiss each little buttercup
At dawning.
If I had Aladdin's lamp
For only a day
I'd make a wish
And here's what I'd say

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

Dreaming was meant for night time
I live in dreams all the day, 
I know it's not the right time,
But still I dream away
What could be sweeter than dreaming,
Just dreaming and drift away. 

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her

Jim Gibson,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I
""You do not know, silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed 
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the signs said
""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence",The Sounds of Silence,2001

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew

Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing

Jim Hall,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin

Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from

Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought

No tears, no fuss,

Whenever I've fallen
When nobody else believes
She'll be there by my side

I don't know how she takes it
Just once I'd like to make it
Then there'll be tears of joy
That fill her loving eyes

When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide

Songs about rainbows
And what's on the other side
Rainbows are visions
They're only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told and some chose to
Believe it
But I know they're wrong wait and see

Someday we'll find it
The Rainbow Connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me

Who said that every wish
Would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star
Somebody thought of that
And someone believed it
And look what it's done so far
What's so amazing
That keeps us star gazing
What so we think we might see

Someday we'll find it
That Rainbow Connection
The lovers the dreamers and me

Have you been fast asleep
And have you heard voices,
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound that calls
The young sailors
The voice might be one and the same
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be

Someday we'll find it

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1999

Oh six' Nino Brown, flip the temp into the carter
Rebirth, don't cut out my four-ways

Bricks lined up like cars at a funeral
I'm working hard white, so I never twurk, touch and bust
My workers on the block, so the work ain't even gotta touch

My money come in stacks and I know just how to get it, man
A low profile, might be ridin' a Honda Civic, man
You'll never know it's me, but a nigga got the work holmes
I move it all day, think he clirpin' on my chirp phone

Connects so sweet and I'm dealin' wit tha Carribeans
They come from 'cross the water
Masked, taped to my Europeans
Supplyin', whole towns, little counters in the projects
Tryna double my money up, leave the block wit a profit

For you nigga's that like to pop, you know I got them pills too
Getcha you a couple of splitters

And you can see the stars when the ride droppin'

Aye, Jim Jones
Let ya boy Parlae get some of that Harlem clientele
I got more crack than a curb, fuck wit me

Put the whip game on it, get some extra dough
Keep the cars pullin' up like it's Texaco
I can make it get stiff like dead people
Keep my hand workin', wit the mic or a egg beater

And ya bank account? Shit, that's my pocket fare
Residue on my clothes, call it roc-a-wear

Sold my part for thirty million

Jim Jones,"[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
There was no love for us (nope)
So we did what we did just to make a buck played around we're fucking nuts (crazy)
Hope them ho's puckerup tryna get them to slide
that's on our mind getting high all the time (we tryna fuck!)
We hustle hard, hope the fiends buy all the dimes
So we can scoop up and hit the party and scoop a bitch (get twisted)
You know the drill homie
Play the rules and play the field but don't get killed homie (stay alive)
So where's the better days?
The have to get up days to cheff up yay just to get us paid (we hustle hard)
You see never it fails most of my homies either dead or jail (gone)
Don't fuck with phonies cause they get you killed (ah ah)
My testimony's every bitter real (thats right)
don't run up on me cause I'm gripping steel (bang bang)
I'm kinda nervous and I'm quick on the blast
due to the murders that I witnessed in town

[Chorus: Denise Weeks]
Livin the life with a rider seems
it's the only thing that I'm gonna run to
that's when you light and get high with me
Look what the ghetto's did to me (Baby)
And when you finish running the streets
I'll be the only one that you gonna run to
Just getting paper and ducking police
Look what the ghetto did to me (uh)(yeah yeah)

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
There was no peace in sight (nope)
It was sleepless night (yup)
Hustling yay breaking day to see the light (money man)
Street squalie you see polices lights (squalie)
As I polie on this decent price
Got a cuses that want some pies 23 a slice
Transactions by the building, uptown Harlem world, Manhattan where we kill them (Taz)
Plus my project way of thinking spending most my days drinking
It's like I'm on my way to sixton (lock in)
But we do what we do that's survival
And we move how we move that's through the rivals (fuck them enemies)
It's been said we living suicidal, it's like rush at eleven placing bucks on your bet
Do your thang slang cane and get your bucks on your steps (watch)
Watch ya ass young man they want you under arrest (thats them pigs)
And you ain't know, they getting stripes for that
They have you in your cell man serving life for that

 Chorus]
[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
Now for my project corners, go hard for warrants (fuck'em)
Every night I make it, I pray to God for goners (I pray to God)
We pour liquor on floors
That's for the soldiers that we lost in the mist of this war (RIP Life)
For the ones on the grind and front line they got called by po nine
And now they prisoners of war
They fight for appeal or a bill or a ball
Cause they slipped and got nailed for a sale of a rob (Zeek you know wassup)
Two shouts for O.B.C.C six main house of fame
When you come home come and see me
Stay cool I lay the rules on ya
Play the fool and they will move on ya
Young niggaz that keep them tools on ya
They quick to let them blickas blast (bang bang)
So crazy the way we get this cash (How we livin?)
Real hot up on these murderous blocks (blaatat blaatat)
Broad day bang bang I know you heard all them shots

Livin the life with a rider seems it's the only thing that I'm gonna run to

Y'all talk about things I've done to my life
You talk about things that I've done to my wife

I know where I'm going so I can come in a crisis
I do this for my niggas, who never get no cheddar
For my niggas up state, that'll never get a letter
For my vitally sick, that would never get no better

For my niggas in the cold, that would never get a sweater
For the life I lead, things I done

Jim Jones,"Got this problem with these niggaz on the other side of town
Plus my little homey Pop-la-di he's a rider now
So you know he want some answers off top he ridin down
With them automatic weapons, load and fire in the pound (bang bang)
Hood devastated, prayin that they let him make it
Heard it 'bout the incident, it's crazy how he just got faded (it's fucked up)
But it's better places, G's call it heaven's Matrix
Pray the Lord open up, they told me how heaven's gated (let a thug in)
Certified, decorated
Murder never hesitated, I heard it was premeditated (who told you that)
And my whole hood segregated
Harlem World's so small, but my whole ghetto dedicated (Eastside, Westside)
We was young, loose cannons
Shoot cannons, point aim, broad day, wherever you standin' (fuck that do it now)
We live our life as a G
Day and, night with the heat, rollin' dice on the street
Now come on

[Chorus: x4]
Do doves fly, when thugs cry?
Here's a story 'bout the trials and tribulations of this thug life

Now, play the game, know the code, say no names
Fast life ain't no game, R.I.P. Baby Main
He was large in the game, slingin' thangs
Shiny rings, diamond chains, he's a star in my hood (he was ?)
All the cars, V12 by the hood
Had the jets, had the strip, had the power, he was livin' that life
New whips every hour, it's a shame, in my hood
He'll be missed like the Towers in the midst of the prowess
Not to put his business out there (uh-huh)
But the kid'll make you think that Po Rich was out here (like '86)
And in these stories it mainly contain the lobby
About the young and the restless like Harlem's main ?

[Chorus]

We light and chill, each night we would chill
Block number, fifty ? seven, movin' white for them bills
Stashin' open rice for it stales, I tried to tell you
That my life is so real, they dog me in and bring me home nine-trey
Took the city on my own crime raid (N.Y.C.)
Invadin' clubs, with brazy bloods (tell 'em)
Tell Peter Geisha what's up, back to the saga, when Light got killed
It's like one side of my life is killed, for real
And Chills turned state fed, couldn't deal with a state bed
But snitchin' breaks the code, gotta lie in your made bed (you know the rules)
No sympathy homey, you gotta follow them codes
You get a thousand years of die in that hole (G's up)

Call my G's when I got to move

Niggaz found a way tryna take my life

Gotta bunch of doggs and I set 'em to bite
So if you niggaz want war we can do it tonight

I'm prayin' to the Lord that optimize
Dip Set Byrd Gang know I'ma ride
And I'ma rep till my last breath
Take a pull of my last hit

Pull up on these niggaz and blast the bitch

We pour liquor on floors that's for the soldiers
That we lost in the mist of this war

For the ones on the grind and front line they got called by po nine
And now they prisoners of war they fight for appeal or a bill or a ball
'Cause they slipped and got nailed for a sale of a rob

Two shouts for O.B.C.C six main house of fame
When you come home come and see me

Now we set them presidents, to get them presidents
Over the ones that are dead, we'll put guns to your head
Put dots on your loaf like you was wonder the bread
Sheek, Zeke, hell rell and I got some in the feds

I contradict what ever the government says
For them boys on my back wit them bugs by my bed
They still thinkin' that we coppin' sellin raw
Tryin' to put us through them Rico and them Rockefeller' laws

I'm in L.A. the top down the pedals floored
Wit a hot stiletto whore, suck my cock tell the law
And for you fagots I see past all your cheap stares
Nowadays I see my past from a beach chair, yeah

And I the fellin' so relaxed and refreshin' when chillin'
A total change from movin' crack off the steps of the building's
Rollin' wit gangs in the back of the jects where the killin'
In Park Ave where young Chris body found
A number is all to add to task body count
Watch it boy they'll show you how that shorty bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce

I'm the most incredible, to ever do what you cats'll never do, or be able to
I'm ahead of you, 'cause I spit like I never ate
And if I did then I'm just never full
Stop the hoe jokes, I'm not a homo, better believe I'll cock the 4-4
I ain't Mexican, but I'll stretch your man, yes I am a fuckin' vato loco

I went from the pot with cocoa to the block with cocoa
To gettin' locked, catchin' a charge dealin' wit the cops with cocoa
Now I'm just hot like cocoa
You can catch me on the block, being watched, in a drop
The same color as chocolate cocoa

I don't walked in the street, with so much raw in my sneaks
God dam, got home and had corns on my feet
I see the Lord when I sleep and often He speaks
He says Juelz you better than all of these creeps

So I got all my shit light, got on my shit right
Not a lot of thems this nice, but the games funny so I gotta do shit right
So to the ball drop and the world blow up, I'm a twirl shit up
Until my peeps come home, Zeke come home
Better believe I'm a keep on beastin' on

Where should I began our pompous, a thousand wins accomplished
Known throughout the atlas, honest been accomplished
You'll be abolished, men, women, children astonished
The don is the one, jewelry way beyond it

Chunky blessed on the chest, funky S when I dress
Thunder storm damn, monkey wrenching' her fresh
But I cope wit the rain, mad I can't float with my dame
Down to the coastal wit Caine, Maine, my boat is a plane

I land on the water, here I go boastin' again
I keep toast, give a toast, inhale smoke for the pain
Girls gone wild, nope, they goin' insane
All doped off the fame, jump rope with my chain

Now that's off the chain, ma take off your chain
I'm 40 will off your brain, kids will be lost and claimed
'Cause of Walton James, now in the orphan game
Whether adoption or foster it's all the same

Jim's the rider of riders, J are's the writer of writers
Juelz you know him well, hell he the fire of fire
I'm the supplier, baffled that's the hustler
Trifle got a knife for that apple inside your jugular

The big apple, I tackle all the customers
Put it on the apple at the castle, come and fuck with us
And further more, got the birds of raw, I deserve a tour
Hey, hey holla' back, swallow that, that's murda' whore

In a Persian turban, swervin', that suburban mergein'
Curvin', herb in the air, yeah, yeah I'm hurtin' y'all
See I crash and cop it, mash and mop it, blast a rocket
Natural born hustler, yeah crack I stocked it

Now my drugs are legal, so just pass the profit
Three months alone sizzurp will smash the notic
We them be boys in one year a quarter billion
Here come the clothin' line, I got your order children
And that's more than illin', long as the Lord is willin'

To get money and rip sleeve off of my city (New York)
And slow down, then try to breeze through the projects be	 (Taft)
And how I speeds in velocity (160)

The boys rushed him, 2 keys of mahogany (Damn!)

How we swoop up in Harlem, 20 Coupes when we mobbin'
40 troops if it's problems (What Nowww!)
Cause 1 nigga you know is a shotgun driver (jus 1 nigga)
Ready to dump triggers, that shotgun fire (blakka!)
I ain't gone front nigga I shot some guys up
(didn't kill 'em though, fuck 'em though)
And they came back to my block like riders (Yop!)
But I'm like ""Crouching Tiger"", spin, roll, crouch and fire (Boom, Yea!)

Give that to the press or Dave Mays in the source (suttin to read about)
Yes, since success it has changed
Since we, stepped up in this game and stepped up wit' our game (ballin')

Look at this world from my latest ride
We knock 'em all if you let this slide
This how you ball if you a major guy
With alcohol and a hazy high

The city lights in the jaded sky
I had this girl, wanna make her mine
I can't lie, I was interested in her
We shared a bed in the club and even crept to dinner

It's such a funny situation
'Cause I knew she had a man in the ave by reputation
I get around I'm just a product of my occupation
I asked her number and she contemplated
I'm losin' patience and it's startin' to get flagrant

Seize the moment or forever regret it
Three in the mornin' and I'm stressin' to catch her
Creepin' up on her and applyin' the pressure
Me and my homey A don't think I can get her, uh but

It's crazy, smooth ghetto angel so amazin'
Smokin' gettin' high with the daisy
Thinkin' 'bout makin' you my lady, maybe
You're a bad girl, she say I only want her for my pleasure
Slow hit it from the back, I do it better
She left me with a kiss and I let her, never sweat her

You seekin' love is watchin' movies on and off the stations
Those commercials was our intermissions
For the [Incomprehensible] and the tongue-kissin' and one instance
Turns some heated touchin' to some freaky fuckin'

My situation is a bit of trouble
See this affair is a bit of struggle
And my persona and my thuggish morals
That was enough to start a lover's quarrel

Since she had a man but he wasn't loyal
Got loose enough just to open up
It be the mornin 'fore he sober up
I call the shit like Punky Brewster
And she never met a thug loser
Star nigga party with the snub shooter

My thug True is probably posted in back
We party hard, get so crazy
And we smoke and drink 'gnac
I'm tryin' to slide in the night on some smutty sex
Niggaz beepin' my phone to ask me did I get her yet

It's crazy, smooth ghetto angel so amazin'
Smokin' gettin' high with the daisy
Thinkin' 'bout makin' you my lady, maybe
You're a bad girl, she say I only want her for my pleasure
Slow hit it from the back, I do it better
She left me with a kiss and I let her, never sweat her

It's gettin' nervous now 'cause the word in town
Is that your man got the word that we done flirtin' 'round
In your Beemer merkin' 'round foreplay in the hallways
So now we hit the house and pull the curtains down

We laugh and we joke, we drink and I pass you the smoke
Smack your ass when you walk, when fuckin' I grab and you joke
Have sex at night as we lay and we chill
Your crib, nice apartment, who's payin' the bills

This type of shit'll get you sprayed and you killed
That's that Harlem shit like Mitch shot in 'Paid in Full'
This is not a movie script, some of my truest shit
Selfish premonition, out of sight I'm out of mind
When this nigga gone and missin'

Wishin' she mine, I'm knowin' that she'll never be
This'll be fine, the closest that I'll ever be
I see a chick and she mine, new Goldie of the ghetto be

It's crazy, smooth ghetto angel so amazin'
Smokin' gettin' high with the daisy

Or put the Spre's on the thang (spinners!)
So I can speed through the game (vroom!)

Fresh outta DC lampin' in the GS

That's how niggas do go get a clip or 2
Fifth or glock, get a block, hit the spot, flip a few
And for a brick or 2, the led I carry, shit
I'm reditary and your kids could get it too

Now if this ain't gangsta and that ain't gangsta
Then what is gangsta?
Nigga, I am gangsta, who ain't gangsta?
You ain't gangsta

Now if this ain't gangsta and that ain't gangsta
Then what is gangsta?

Defeat, misconceptions
Man, fuck all that, I don't know what that's about but fuck all that
Jim, I'm in the building
Dipset, it's your turn, you up nigga!
Let's go!

I'm puffin' my weed and these niggaz, they mad
I'm frontin' this season
As far as they hoes, they want me to see 'em
I fuck 'em and then they don't want me to leave 'em
An addictive obsession, I twist 'em, I sex 'em
My dick's an obsession
They call me, they miss me, they stressin'
I call 'em, they miss me, they stressin'

These hoes, they sayin' that shit that'll kill ya
I'm rich now, this kid look familiar
As far as my Dips, we rich the cars and the whips
We spent what you spent on your car on my wrist
Don't bother me bitch
In the midst of this grind, I'm twistin' my lime
I'm 'bout to get cash, and you can kiss ass
Dipset got this shit up on smash

This is Jim Jones, he's breezin' on chrome
Ya best bet is leave him alone
O.G. in them stones, spent G's on them stones
Now mami just send me the tone

These are true stories, I used to live poorly
And now man I live in two stories
Get suited in Maury, the coupe is Ferrari
The coupe cost 140, you don't wanna race, I will move on you shorty
Look good on them cameras
They love me, I put my whole hood up on cameras
They bloody, niggaz in hood with them blamas
Tell me, so do it for grandma

We did it from druggin' and [Incomprehensible]
We did it from hustlin' and comin' up wrong
We did it from strugglin' and comin' up strong
Still runnin' with cons, with guns in their palms
You front on Dipset, we will dump on your moms
Or come through with bombs and stop and park
And set off them bombs

This is Jim Jones, he's breezin' on chrome
Ya best bet is leave him alone
O.G. in them stones, spent G's on them stones
Now mami just send me the tone

You got to admit I'm hot when I spit
Like a summertime's tropic's eclipse
Like a drop on the strip with no top on the whip
A block it yeah I put with them cops on the strips
With glocks on their hip
Like shells when they drop when them shots get dismissed
The pain in my heart been my aim from the start
We started when we came from the star

Now we all gainin' on charts
With back to back hits, like Yankees an' shit
Dipset, we gangsta as shit but I credit my ghetto
'Cause now we rock platinum, the preciousest metal
Don't press us, we'll press on this metal and blow you apart
Shoulda known from the start
My jewels, they glow in the dark
You fools, keep playin' ya part

This is Jim Jones, he's breezin' on chrome
Ya best bet is leave him alone
O.G. in them stones, spent G's on them stones

Turn'em up a little more, turn'em up a little, yeah there we go yeah, uh yeah

[Bizzy Bone]
Born in the poverty probably we never get off the monopoly, won't we just stop it 
With all the monotony, look at me awkwardly hide my broccoli, nigga what
Fuck the media, how could you come to me, follow me, bother me, tell me to simmer it down
Part of the system is worser now, melody murder must've ran
What if the rapture happens, nigga just deeper than rapping vanish or not
Never gone change my style, I do what I wanna pop, 'til the ""Body Rot"" stop
Generation X, I am the mastermind, general militants seven times, revolution rebellious, totally out of line
I still in the mind of apocalyptic, biblical optimistic
Thank my lucky stars, never I say my graces, I'm so thankful god
Take me to the promise land, all I see is cops with guns
Soap in my sock, county charges stuck in the struggle with number one
Never will have a friend like me, reality checking the crooked judge
Man because the rapping is over, we fucking soldiers, we fucking thugs
And ain't nobody stopping my fucking drugs
If I can melt down the words, and put them in plastic sucks, rip it to the nation, let it go what, what
Bitch I would speak your mind, even if they offended you 'cous
Ride off in the sun set, with the streets niggas 'cause that's who I love
Standing next to Capo twin towers shoot up to the heaven sky
We rolling down the ninety-five, take the bridge, I'm ready to die..................

[Bizzy Bone]
For the grace of Capo... for the grace of Capo, in the moment of silence, 
Now the grace of Capo, in the moment of silence, in the mist of tyrants and silence,
And the demon malignancies, motherless children are born, poppa the one who murdered her,
Witness the vision first hand plumping master of source of us

[Jim Jones]
By the, grace of Capo, in the moment of silence, in the mist of tyrants and violence,
I'm flossing my diamonds, by the grace of Capo, in he mist of the hood, and it should be all good,
But murders go down, you know they go down

[Jim Jones]
Straight out the projects be, I'm telling ya'll it was so hard for me (so hard)
Coming up hard in these Harlem streets, where niggas will starve, cause it's hard to eat
Some niggas will rob in the hardcore streets, ridiculous all it's hard concrete (watch it)
Bitches the boosters the credit card scammers, niggas that shoot cause they all gone blame us
People they shoot cause they cocky 'bout scanners (scwalay!) 
So if watch where the birds fly, (watch it) don't speed when you swerve high
Cause believe me the third eye, put the squeeze on your whole ride (lock down)
See I'm always in the rear view, see the law in your rear view (what else) pray to the lord he can hear you (why)
I'm the nigga on the corner, plus my niggas on the corner bring same shit
Three carry gripes in the crime in heaven, I'm in this Fahrenheit called 9/11
When I go to the cross roads, lord knows Ferrari white, mean highway to heaven (forgive them lord)
And these digital times, we all need to have a political mind (that's right)
Federology, technology, and we can shine like astrology (they can see from the stars)
When we walking on eggshells, when you talk on next cells (what happens)
When you talking on fed cells (listen to me) and we all on sex cells (whooo)
When the drugs and rock-n-roll, and when the drugs lock your soul
Don't blame it on 'caine, got rich when the reggae came (that's right)
Bill Clinton rejuvenated us (yeah), all been the Bush's hoovernated us (stupid)
Police will soon be chasing us (that's right), the streets they be afraid of us (yeah)
From cutting up raw, from frying up coke, give a fuck about war
We ain't trying to voting (voting)
So if you draft me jail me (you hear that)
Or better yet kill me (uh-huh) 'cause I rather go to hell be, and there's nothing you can tell me
Cause we risking ourselves, just sit in the cell, over punk as nigga in cells (damn)
All the grief in the cells, spin on shelves, I'm running out of time, cause I'm living in hell (yeah)

[Jim Jones]
By the, grace of Capo in this moment of silence, in the mist of the violence, the mist of tyrants,
Flossing my diamonds......yeah, by the grace of Capos nigga, you heard, that's two strong armies nigga
Two under bosses we can't be stopped, we will not be brought down like the twin towers
We some political soldiers ghettolutionists, we freedom fighters

7th Lennox and what about the east side
El Barrio, we blowin' smoke while we G ride
Washington Heights dime lo tato you know
Todo bien tato capo, uh oh

Shot out to Taft where them killas is made
We was out on the Ave., young dealin' that gay
Tryin' to get cash pumpin' crills to get payed
Alcohol in my glass blunt filled up with haze

We congregated in front them grocery stores
Sellin' crack held gats and conversate while we smoked the raw
And sit on crates like they lay-Z boys
The strip we wait like the 80's boy

And whip up 8th in the latest toy like it's the only thing to do
You know the house parties you had to bring your crew
And you know we stay fly Pelle leather with the boots
And niggaz shake the dice and call you bet out 'fore you shoot

You lookin' scared, money fall better to the deuce
We would set up on the stoop, gettin' wet up on the stoop
And watch the dust fiends gettin' wet up off the juice
Tryin' to get up off that loot so we could get up on the coupes

7th Lennox and what about the east side
El Barrio, we blowin' smoke while we G ride
Washington Heights dime lo tato you know
Todo bien tato capo, uh oh

I wish Harlem Lee was still around
You know the jam packed traffic buggin' out in front of Willie's Lounge
I been doing this since Nucleus was open
Coppin', they black well who knew what we was smokin'

Took a few pulls had you movin' slow motion
Walkin' pass the Carter, now it's pokie still smokin'
And I could still picture the sports bar
Niggaz think they hot shit whippin' up in the sports car

State building jams, remember Farraqan had that fake million man
Copped the fly jackets from Carlos at the mall
Or be in King Domes poppin' bottles in the park
Don't play on 40th cause they'll rob you after dark

Wolf pack gang don't jog Central Park
F.T.W fuck the world
Drinkin' 40's got us fucked up till we earl
In this hustler's world

7th Lennox and what about the east side
El Barrio, we blowin' smoke while we G ride
Washington Heights dime lo tato you know
Todo bien tato capo, uh oh

Somebody tell Cuda, let me in this cherry lounge
This ain't Queens homie you surrounded by deadly grounds
And I was downtown just watchin' the caine flip
Heard a nigga from the west side was fuckin' my same bitch

But them bitches didn't care
Just tryin' to get some cash buy some sneakers fix they hair
Ride up Lennox Ave. you smell the reffer in the air
3rd Ave. viva Puerto Rico the Boricua fair

African parade every year, the whole block is there
You want raw yay, Broadway you go cop it there
Shit, and we can cruise autobahn, go buy the rawest chron
Or around the clock baby even 4 in the morn'

The summer time, we still illin' on them
God they clear the whole 7th, poppin' wheelies on them squads
Terror Squad still got the hottest team in the Rucker
Look real close, you can see it from the brucker

Jim Jones,"[Chorus: Latiff]
When I'm dippin on the grind I get my money quick
But sometimes I wanna lay up wit my honey dip
She be wit me cause she aint like all them other chicks
Let you hit, then she split, that's why I got a honey dip
From the club to the telly you know how it is
Most of the chicks I never tell em where a nigga live
Tryna reach me at my mansion or my mother crib
Hit my cell, hit my two, now I'm at my honey dips

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Yo we talked about 8, said I was comin thru to hit
Now its wee hours in the mornin and I'm drunker than a bitch
Stumblin and shit, I jumped up in the whip
Flipped open the horn like where's my honey dip
And bitch fuck ya man tonite, you know my steelo
Sizzurp wit the Cristal, the corners playin cee-lo
You see me well you jus smile you know we on the le-low
I'm whippin thru the town like we boilin up a kilo
Huh, I'm tryna dip up in the tele
Dip up in the room, then dip up in her belly
Dip off on Pirelli's, Dip-Sets Fonzarelli
My white t-shirt, lookin dip up in my Pelle
Smokin weed up in the Range
Full speed left lane
Its me against the world, M.O.B. up in my vein
Wit another nigga girl, gettin low to give me brain
If the bitch about the cause you aint gotta spit no game

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Jr Writer]
You know I'm lookin for a honey dip
But I'm no dummy, most these bunnies
are money hungry and lookin for a money clip
So after the brother hit
I'll tell a honey dip
She won't see a contact, address nor buddy list
I aint on some hubby shit
That lovey dovey shit its nuttin trick I'm suttin slick you couldn't get
enough of it
How a slugger jus slide up thru the check in
Wit that linin on the Wesson
Hundred diamonds on my neck and wrist shit
I'm rich bitch, rhymings my profession
Watch how I do this stupid grindin and perfectin
Who's flyer when I step in got em spyin every second, cause that 06
Charger remind em of a 7
Yes man I'm so fresh the pro mess wit bread honey
My jeans 800, these are called Red Munkey
The flossin is gone, come talk to a Don fly enough to belong on a
catwalk in Mulan.....holla

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
I got me a lovely chick, I got me a slutty chick, I got em all, but my
favorite one is my honey dip
She get drunk wit me, roll the piff up wit me
Throw singles at other hoes in the strip club wit me
She do anything for jus one quicky
She a nympho chick
For this slow dick
She give no lip, she jus go get
The paper I ask her for, my bitch so quick
Plus she know every Santana song and she don't mind puttin the damn bandana on
Slap her ass tell her dance in this thong
She do it all for daddy
She move it all for daddy...Aye Aye
She get a brick and she boof it all for daddy
Hit the road shake the State Troopers off for daddy
And she bring all that paper back
No short paper back, she sure don't play wit that

It makes it hard I'm tryna show her I've grown up
But deep down inside she know I will never give them ho's up

Next thing I got caught up, she had me trippin' like a mushroom
Shit became fucked up 'cause we both became love-struck
I be out commitin' crimes, she be still up on my mind

Now I'm tryna shake it off, she still drippin' through tha brain
You know I fean for her like a hit of that Cocain

We going back and forth, goddamn, this ain't a movie, yo

You can't cool me off, tried to tell you I'm hot

Goin' hard for 16
Livin' that fast life like I'm made for the big screen
And y'all know how I get in the club
A nigga knew the bouncer, a 4-fifth in the club

I try to two step, 4-fifth can't budge

And I'm tryin' to duck the law dogs I'm gettin' indicted
They done showed me the money, shit the kid got excited

So if the kid get an inch, well, I'm takin' a yard

Always pull me over they be dyin' to frisk me
Car smell like weed and I be reakin' of liquor
Told me I was free but they see I'm the nigga

I gotta leave 'em one bigger

Get up, let's not make it a issue
But if a nigga piss me off I'm goin' straight to the pistol

And what the bitches thought of them, it's all about the money

But he stitched of course, now let's talk about Fritz the boss
And he got rich off snort, they said 500 bricks was brought
So in hindsight, it's a shorty who couldn't get a gist of his thought
But if you grind right wit the snorpy, a whip could be bought
Now think about po-9, if it caught me, how it get you in court
But now the feds, they still tailin' me, DA think he nailin' me

Jim Jones,"They say rap music is subliminal
But the music for us is like our own diary
Something like a confession
They tell me life is a bitch

She's something like the seasons
Just like mother nature
She come and go as she please
That's why they get their period once a month

I say that to say this, if you think that bitch
Summer is yours, she could be cheating on you
Ya heard?

Uh, just got me feeling like opium
I'm tryna dance with the loaded M
Open up a bottle and it goes around
I'm leaving drunk by 4 a.m.

And watch me jump in the golden Benz
Top down with the pokey rims
Now I'm swerving, so you know I'm bent
I lost count, who knows what I spent

I recall nine cleavage
Bitches stepping on my nice sneakers
One hand in the sky, the other hand was on her thigh
I was grinding to the beat with my hammer on my side

Now G's only as we speed to the Rolex
And three or four G's is what we sneeze at the Rolex
Play some out your part, it's about 6 a.m.
You think the night is over but it just began

They say clubs pacing like Bad Boys 2
You can see the snow bunnies do what bad girls do
And that's ecstasy, weed that had girl too
Scoop the bitch that had key's to some fast old blue

Now, I'm speeding to the telly, I got the Porsche behind
Trying to get in her belly the only thought on my mind
Like damn, I'm not trying to be pushy or nothing but
Since the strip joint girl, I should have been fucking

I shoulda lil' mama, listen
Spending my summers with the top dropped low
Throwing my hundreds at the top notch hoes
When we smoking on the top notch dro
Dro, dro, that's the summer wit Miami

Bottle in the air, I'm living without a care
Shorty beside me, wind blowing through her hair
Oh, no, no, that's the summer wit Miami

I can't keep it low anymore
I'll be with my girl, when it starts to snow, I get bored
And when you love three women
It's hard keeping up with lies

See, spring's my first love, I started creeping with July
Used to say I had some shows
Catching planes to M I
Then I started tricking dough, I brought the range for July

Mama said, I'm love sick over this hot ass hoochie
I seen her when I told Nas I slapped her with coffy
We don't play disrespect but that was the day that we met
Summer jam O 2, I hit the stage with my set

But her man, he was from Brooklyn
She still slipped me the number
She said, he's on vacation, so, get with me this summer
Then I been flirting wit her for about the past two years

So now, she hates seeing me in the winter
Ain't gonna last through the year
So now, I'm looking at winter like life's an adventure
And when June come, I'll be gone till September

Now, would you hate me for that?
I know your heart's cold, could you wait till I'm back?
I'm just a sucker for love
But a nigga hold you down if you wanna fuck with a thug

Spending my summers with the top dropped low
Throwing my hundreds at the top notch hoes
When we smoking on the top notch dro
Dro, dro, that's the summer wit Miami

Bottle in the air, I'm living without a care
Shorty beside me, wind blowing through her hair
Oh, no, no, that's the summer wit Miami

Spending my summers with the top dropped low

And I ain't hard to find, I'm in New York like the Rangers
My team, what? We all are nice

We pack guns and go to clubs and we ball all night
Crack sales in the slums, break the law all night
So the glock stay stashed up

Its easy for me ta cope them things
And I don' stop, I got rocks in rings
You know, the same size as a boxing ring
Swimming pool in the front and the the backyard
I ain't gotta act hard
I'm under 21 wit a black card
And yeah I know, that was kind of a low blow
But the the doe for the So-So don't come slow

Eastside walk it out, northside walk it out

Now walk it out like a usher
If you say real talk I probably won't trust you
If you wanna go to war, the gun's my pleasure
Even Jesus had 12 disciples on the level, trigger, whatever
Pumm you don't want now dega 3 thou
I'm like jury duty your new to this part of town
Your white tee well to me looks like a nightgown
Make you mama proud take that thing to sizes down
Then you look like the man that you are or what you could be
I could
I give a damn 'bout your car but then that would be
If it was considered a classic before the drastic change in production 
When cars were metal instead of plastic value
Is what I'm talking about
Take two of these and walk it out
You'll be the reason they talk it out
You can't be the king in the parkin' lot, forever
Not saying I'm the best but till they find something better
I am here no fear write me a letter 'till then
I walk it out

I westside walk it out

Then eastside walk it out

I walk it out the bank with a lot of zeros
That's what my teachers call me predictions like they Cleo
So I did my dance for 'em
They make about 40,000
I do that in a month I'm no resorts and islands
I make them walk it out yeah it's me again
But I'm with Jones that phat stacks and Benjamin
I roll with made men
That brakes the stage in
And keep the girls happy
So you all can get the nappy
Gangsters they do they dance they do it to my song
See I was up in cali crip walking it all night long
Drop 20 on my neck got 10 on they wrist
A billion dollar look a million dollar kiss
I'm nation wide homie you're still at home homie
With no promotions on me man that's Bologna homie
The album off in stores I'm beating down you block
Now going walk it out and they're still on my jock

Eastside walk it out Bronx walk it out
Queens walk it out you know Brooklyn walk it out
Now Harlem walk it out Harlem walk it out Harlem walk it out Harlem walk shit out
Now we don't walk it out we drop top porsha it out
After I floss it out I bring my air forces out
I'm blowing purple smoke I cough it out
Ball it up and ball it out tap the bottle and then pour it out balling'

Now do the fade away, throw some paper away.
And we can skate away, tell the hoes I'll be late today.
Or I can thug it out or star stud it out.
I take a trip with my bitch and Louie luggage out.
I'm talking magic city or even body taps.
You know that money ain't a thing, we're throwing thousand stacks.
Oh yeah we toss it out, you know what I'm talking about.

Ya know like that shit sound like rock music
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Yea, my man Bruno just stepped in

You know how we living it up
We all gettin' money
That's what he like to say
Fuck it, it's my life nigga

This is a dream of a hustler
I had the butter and the fiends was in love with us
We copped the gutta, not a team that could fuck with us
And word to mother keep the thing in every truck with us

Now I was fronting like Rich was and some of my bitches
Was going so hard, got some of us sick thugs
And minor setbacks got some of us tripped up
But the guns we done gripped up so we coming to get ya

And fuck the local authorities
And hope the big boys don't pick up my case
'Cause for these big toys and these chips, we get chased
Playing ball just like the Orioles to get to 1st base

But the goons on 2nd, bust on 3rd
You know they move with the weapons, get bucks off birds
It's like I'm playing Chicken with my life
Tryna get this paper moving pitches for a price

I come to ride out with them niggas, baby, we getting figures
It's byrd gang, we doing it big
But we towered up, get the Remy I'll need a cup
You slippin' good, can I get a squeeze?

I don't think you want it with them niggas
'Cause them hammers they won't hesitate to squeeze
We on the road, travel 'cross the globe
All my homies ain't diggin' cheese

Look the nightmares of a trap star
With white tees, Nike air's and my fast car
D.A tryna wrap me in the charge
But I just bought some V's and a pack in my garage

Now me rapping what's the odds?
We the last crew standing diplomats now in charge
Yeah, 300 for the light show
Another hundred on the hand to watch the ice glow

Another 10 grand to watch the dice roll
Trying to let you motherfuckers see this how my life go
The bright lights and this big city
I'ma live the nightlife until the pigs get me

Range Roving, Big Truck Series
The chain frozen, big chunk jewelry
White girls say he's all semi cool
But you don't want to cost him 'cause he got a short fuse

I come to ride out with them niggas, baby, we getting figures
It's byrd gang, we doing it big
But we towered up, get the Remy I'll need a cup
You slippin' good, can I get a squeeze?

I don't think you want it with them niggas
'Cause them hammers they won't hesitate to squeeze
We on the road, travel 'cross the globe
All my homies and they get cheese

We live life on reality and we flip white for a salary
You might catch us at the light in the lavish V
But watch them 'Blue And Whites', try and grab a G

Making some chips so the hate's getting thick
Watch the world through my tint, smoking haze in the whip
Contemplate, maybe take a little trip
Ocean Drive heavy glean in my neck chillin'

Call up cabs, rushing drinks out of 'Wet Willies'
""Eu Seuy O Balling"", but y'all foolish
Getting locked up for crimes and ya lawyer's ain't Jewish
That's why I keep the Turnie's on the tainer

'Cause every time I turn I'm getting chained up
They say what they want to search, tryna tame us
I think they mad we from the turf and we dangerous
And my whole crew icey we playing hockey like the rangers

I come to ride out with them niggas, baby, we getting figures
It's byrd gang, we doing it big
But we towered up, get the Remy I'll need a cup
You slippin' good, can I get a squeeze?

I don't think you want it with them niggas
'Cause them hammers they won't hesitate to squeeze
We on the road, travel 'cross the globe

And yet there's more to life than misery
We have to have unity in our community
We have to work together brothers and sisters

Yeah, this is Dr. Ben, I'm with Jim Jones
(Lord knows, I was on the run confused)
DipSet forever
(Shit)
We're talking about a concrete jungle
(Yeah, it sure is a jungle)
Life or death, you have to choose life
(I done seen it all, at least I think I seen it all)

I'm with my concrete jungle, no Tarzans and Janes
Diesel by the bundles and the hard grams of Caine
D's when they come through, it's hard to get some change
Smoking weed getting drunk, in the car for a flame

Yeah, I see the traffic but we dipping on the shoulder
Winter start to set in, it's only getting colder
And I miss you all my political soldiers
Most are doing life for moving bricks or doing hold-ups

Damn, I know we caught up in the fast life
Some like a fiend when they caught up on the glass pipe
Me, I'm still caught up from last night
Same clothes from the club on the block getting cash right

Damn, you know this world full of misery
Some get tore up 'til they hurl off the liquor be
Somebody told me that the girls need the chivalry
That's why I cop ice 'til they ass get the shivers be

Ain't nothing sweet living in this ghetto

Been there, done that, so I can live out all my dreams
(Live out my dreams)
Now put your lighters to your head, nigga ride

For the coke I would sleep hard
But the game drove me nuts, in the streets, I'm a full-fledged retard
Was the city block overseer
Man your life is Chuck E. Cheese, mine is a pizzeria

How many pies I done flipped? I lost count
How many guys I done gave shit? I lost count
Holding but I can't ignore cheating
Any day your life could be the hot topic at that board meeting

They discussing who'll stretch you for your trees
For your thievery, you living, you breathing for no fucking reason
That's how it is when you make a man
That's why your man's gotta learn to make himself then you shake his hand

Man, I'm into catching heavy clams
And when Dezzy can us when it comes to dumping I got heavy hands
Ain't gonna be right for your picking jet
This is ours, the square is where we eat, this our kitchenette

Ain't nothing sweet living in this ghetto

Been there, done that, so I can live out all my dreams

Now put your lighters to your head, nigga ride

I let my temper hit the floor
I be staring through the mirror as I serenade my halls
I'm fond of the juices that marinate they drawers
My shorty, she bank a carrot with the four 'cause

If you take us out, the streets will evolve
Some niggaz they live to eat, some niggaz eat to survive
And my conscience keep disturbing me, fucking with my energy
Niggaz that I thought was friends, really the enemy

Dear Lord, please grant me the serenity
To accept the things that I cannot change
Locked up for eight years and ain't join no gangs
Been converted to true nigga, I'm as real as they come

And any moment I have you staring the barrel of my gun
Put my dick up in the streets but I'm married to the slums
Put the chips up in the ante and tally up the sum
I'm having fun, hitting the fiends in the allies with some jums

Ain't nothing sweet living in this ghetto
(Ain't nothing sweet about it)
Been there, done that, running in the streets
(I'm running young, wild and free)
Now put your lighters to your head, nigga ride

Trying to make the most of my hustle

Now put your lighters to your head, nigga ride

Alright, yeah but in choosing life, you got choices
(Oh yeah)
The jungle is full of everything
It's the mother and the father of creation
(Ain't nothing sweet about it)
But listen up, you have to choose something for yourself
Do something for yourself, make something of yourself

That's what time it is

Go strong, be strong, stand for something in life

Life was all crazy getting rich off cocaine
So I been caught up dog, nothing like Usher
More like a hustler

All night with customers, tryna get my paper up
Jealousy, envy gotta watch, they'll spray you up
But it was something bout the gun play
Rolling dice on blocks, double parked up on a one way

In love with a stripper, alcohol on ya brain

When it come to birds fly south to Miami
Weather like 80, drop-top Mercedes
""Sai Pa Say"", on the block in Little Haiti

Chicago is the wolves, the bears and the gangster's

And all these O. T trips got me tired, drive the wheels
'Til they fall off and I just bought some new tires

Girl, you shook me in ways
You know the life of a nigga's cookin' up yay
And because you knew the pitfalls and the tumbles of the game

You've seen the spotlight watch niggas fallin' to the fame
And all the time you tried to tell me to stay hungry and maintain
When I was like let's go half on a baby
And if not then lets go half on a 'cedes

Drop top coup while we pumpin' sweet sadie
Flyin' up Lennox, doin' us, pushin' 80
The road trips, the late nights got you pissed
The road trips, the late nights got us rich

The clothes that we wear, the place that we piss
Run and get shot, we ain't what we sit
So if I don't get a chance to tell you
Now too often lately girl how your hand so helpful

In this cold world girl every man needs help too
So baby, I'ma ride and no plans to fail you

Please, baby, don't push me away
I want you
Please, baby don't push me away
I need you

I had enough of the shucking and jiving, duckin' and hidin'
I'm tryin' to get to conversation and ridin'
'Cause I'm feelin' your essence your presence
Is just enough to let me know that it's destined

And since the day that I found you, there's something about you
That makes me want to lose it and pounce ya
But it's not just your body, it's your mind
Your spirit, everything combined

And while I got a chance, take my hand
And let me show you something real, that love you can feel

Please, baby, don't push me away
I want you
Please, baby don't push me away
I need you

Uh, now two years done passed, few cheers, few laughs
Coppin' Vs, shoppin' sprees gears in the bags
And who cares who's near 'cause most of the bitches
Would just say you was there for the cash

And I ain't scared of your past, I prepare for the future
The one thing I ask is just don't tear a nigga coup up
You brang the bail when I was caged up
And back and forth the court to the lawyer now we case shut

You found the numbers in my phone, you was my face but
You know what they say the break ups to make ups
And I admit I'm getting better with the flirtin'
You know you dead sexy when you yellin' and you cursin'

You such a hell of a person
So when I get home I'm gonnna tell you in person
Face to face, I'ma run base to base
And then I'ma slide home safe till I make yo body shake

You tell me every night that life comes with a twist
That I'm in the spotlight and I'm runnin' the risk
Hey, you always say love don't come with a kiss
It's hard soakin' up game when it's comin' from a bitch

But where's my manners, never take you for granted?
Never take you advantage, most people don't understand it
Is you happy? Look inside humor
When you and I together what the fuck they gonna do wit us?

Say ya prayer 'cause we destined for glory
And when the credits roll it's Harlem's West Side Story

My vision of the lovin' is close
That's how I want us to be when we doin' our thing
Kissin' ya, lickin' ya, touchin' ya, rubbin' ya
Tell me how you want me to bring it?

Because I know he got limits
But baby I don't, and my feelin's they won't
Let you get away from me, come stay with me
Baby, baby, please, baby, don't push me away

When the sunshine turn to rain
Baby, I can take away your pain
Just call me up when you need some time
I'll take you out, break you off like daddy come on

You don't have to settle for less
And baby, I can give you what you want
Just call me up when you need some time
And you can get it from me just like daddy come on

Free to cop a ride, hundred thousand on the V
Wallin' in the whip, let's talk politics
They say niggas from New York is saw by the flip

I got gas in the range, cash on the chain
And I'm flying up lennox fast in the lane
They say it's all up in the streets
I'm trying to make a million while I'm dodging from police

We got mami on the dance floor
Grindin' to the beat, tipsy off the bubbly
But at the end of the day, we feelin' to play
I'm tryin' to pin the tail on the donkey

It goes yes, yes yo, fresh to death balla
You can play hard, under pressure I'm stoned
We playin' tight D, I'm in the paint like a G
Some say they gangstas but they ain't like me

Came from an environment, came I was firin'
Then hit the dealers see the range I was buyin'
Don't test drive like a whole whip like you should
Shoving up pies, a whole whip that you should

Then take the proceeds, waist about four G's
Bottles in the club tryin' to get the home and skeez
I'm tryin' to get the dame to breeze
But she putting up a fight like Layla Ali

And I came from the block, was flawless with ex-cons
And we aimin' them glocks, of course, ready to bomb

Now I done seen a custy cop four pies of the same gear
I also seen a nigga cop four rides in the same year
The concrete jungle, no trees to swing from
This weed and gettin' drunk and heaters gettin' dumped

Or hit the highway, nigga, key's up in the trunk
Back up in the city with some skeezers in the trunk
I ain't a player but I do my dirt, dawg
Drop top 'Cedes better move when it murk off

And I'm tucked up with my boys in back, fucka

I feel the walls spinnin' like the sky gon' come down
I need air, top of the ride, gon' come down

Breezin' from the telly puffin marijuana
White T and my pelly thuggin' like la Fonz
Made it rain on them bitches a bucket full of ones

We got them gold diggers, cold bitches
That wanna party off patron liquor, car hoppers the hard stoppers
Catch 'em at the party call 'em bar hoppers
We live up in the sky you call 'em star watchers

They chase dope boys trap stars with fast cars
And executives rap stars with black cars
So we could swipe it charge it to the game
Trips to M.I.A. Murcielago in the lane

She's got a thing for slippin' clique and goin' clubbin' at nights
Ain't nothin' like the love of my life
She likes the finer things and fuck with niggaz whose money is right
Ain't nothin' like the love of my life

She love the dick suck it till it cum
She say I'm the best fuck of her life
She give a nigga the energy he need
Whenever he feels nothin' is right

Now we in M.I. party till the noon
Hammers in the ride Ferrari's go zoom
All types of incidentals charges on my room
From last night buggin', we mobbin' with the goons

We hit the town hard, fuckin' with the ladies
Bottles of viva clique, puffin' on the hazy
It's all deja vu seen it all before
Got her in my drop heater on the floor

So I sped off from the spot, gettin' heady rock
Got her in the telly she wouldn't let a nigga pop
And when I woke all I seen was a note
Nigga follow the trail and meet me in A T L

She's got a thing for slippin' clique and goin' clubbin' at nights
Ain't nothin' like the love of my life
She likes the finer things and fuck with niggaz whose money is right
Ain't nothin' like the love of my life

She love the dick suck it till it cum
She say I'm the best fuck of her life
She give a nigga the energy he need
Whenever he feels nothin' is right

Now we pull up in the a shoppin' in Lenox mall
Gotta get fly squad ready to ball
We thinkin' 112 or maybe even visions
Drinks at the bar like baby what you sippin'

Then she told me magic city fat asses and they pretty
They got me blowin' thousands throwin' stacks by the fifty
Got some bitches out of strokers gotta get focus
I'm tryin' to play my cards like a game of strip poker

Flight up in the mornin' gotta get up on her
When I leave you can tell ya friends about my performance
And all the time M.O.B. on my mind
The weekend was nice baby but I'm back to N.Y.

She's got a thing for slippin' clique and goin' clubbin' at nights
Ain't nothin' like the love of my life
She likes the finer things and fuck with niggaz whose money is right
Ain't nothin' like the love of my life

She love the dick suck it till it cum
She say I'm the best fuck of her life
She give a nigga the energy he need
Whenever he feels nothin' is right

Now wutchu know about that? 
I know all about that 
3 birds, 3 nights can make a 100 thousands stacks 
And man they got it on camera

I'm a easy target they know a nigga rock hard 
Get a clean check cut slip it in my account 
Write ? china white a lil' ? will wipe em out

In these niggas wit the rapid legs ? in the shirts

AND I'm sellin' them cheaper than yesterday so whatchu say?

And you kno when I b high when im n da V.I.P

But I'm da greatest n Atlanta dey be callin' me Ali

My niggas cut throat My niggas cut throat
I got some killas on the east and the west coast
Dem braids on your head, get up hoe, uh get up hoe, uh get up hoe
My niggas cut throat My niggas cut throat

They whip game real good, they got the best tho
Uh get up hoe, uh get up hoe

[The Game:]
I'm coming straight for your neck dawg,
Razor blade hecklered and cocked,
In California niggas back on the block,
I'm from Compton muthafucka, the city of Gs
We ain't got pretty bitches but we got plenty of these
All my niggas cut throat, gang bang and cut throat
Original bad boys man even Puff know
We ain't mad about Pac, we know who did it
We just mad that him and Big got crossed in none senses
I was 16 then, little nigga inspired
Now me and Joc ridin, homie put that on the wire
If hip hop was a building, I'd set it on fire
and leave everybody to burn except Mya (haha)
Nah, fuck you bitch, I rescue all my niggas first and let em' fuck you bitch
On the east coast, them niggas say I'm dumb-hot
And when I'm in the south you can just ask Yung Joc

[Chorus : 2x]
My niggas cut throat My niggas cut throat
I got some killas on the east and the west coast
Dead Prez on your head, get up hoe, uh get up hoe, uh get up hoe
My niggas cut throat My niggas cut throat
I got some killas on the east and the west coast
They whip game real good, they got the best tho
Uh get up hoe, uh get up hoe

[Yung Joc:]
Eh, I know some edgehangers, zonin till they reach the course
Ya dey head banging for less than a brick or soft
Well acquainted with fiends and even dope addicts
My niggas work the triple beams and they dope at it
Hey, nigga you don't want no static
Holes throw your chest, hard to breathe, like asthmatics
Just like Big, tell them niggas, kidnap your kids,
Fuck em in the ass and throw um over the bridge
When I'm on the east, I'm ballin' wit that Jimmy cat (ballin!)
Bad bitches everywhere, they all on my Jimmy sack
We blowin sour Ds, hundred fifty packs,
I fuck with real Gs, like the Diplomats
When I'm in cali, nigga we blow incense
Call my nigga Cavi, to smoke away my stress
The only coats you'll see locs and dickie suits or molguls
Chirp my nigga JTLo in the booths it's ova

[Chorus : 2x]

[Jim Jones:]
(Jones! Jackal!)
Now shouts to Yung Joc (its poppin)
Another one to block (its good)
You can meet me in the hood the engine runnin on my drop (Ferrari shit)
And we was just runnin from the cops (yeah)
Cookin coco coco wit the stove or two wonders with the pots (Chef boy R' Jim)
I started as a pumper on tha block, (uh huh)
Either you slang crack rock or you had that wicked jump shot (swish)
Either or, there was no inbetween, (no)
It was either be poor or move coke to the feends (get money)
20 it would cost, I was hopin 19 (give it to me cheaper)
Tachiney valaws [?] I endulging the team (I was fly)
Amongst the murders and plus the burglars (Who else?)
The fly willie niggas when they start swerving up (and what)
In them fly rides, niggas like the high side, (flossin')
Till they go slippin and you catch em' from the blind side (get outta that ride)
Tap the glass and you give it to them 9 times (pow pow)
He owes some cash but he didn't meet the timer (D O L)

[Chorus : 2x]
