David Guetta,"I've been fragile for a long time
A big old hole inside my heart
And I was searching through the valley
Stumbled on love in the dark

Was afraid to try but afraid to never know
What it feels like to be loved
Had a hill to climb
But the places we could go
Oh, I gotta know

So if we ever, fell in love
Would the wind blow, would the pain go, oh
So if we ever, fell in love
Oh, oh, oh

I was empty, it was all gone
The birds would sing but made no sound
Till I met you, found I was all wrong
You picked me up right off the ground

Was afraid to try, and afraid I'd fall again
Crashing down from the sky, you know
Had a hill to climb, but with you my heart wont mend
That's the one thing, we all wanna know

So if we ever, fell in love
Would the wind blow, would the pain go, oh
So if we ever fell in love
Oh, oh, oh

I just wanna know, I just wanna know
Tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know

I just wanna know, I just wanna know
Tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know

I just wanna know, I just wanna know
Tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know

I just wanna know, I just wanna know
Tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know

So if we ever fell in love
Would the wind blow, would the pain go, oh
(Yeah) So if we ever fell in love
Oh, oh, oh

So if we ever fell in love
Oh, I wanna know what it feels like to be loved",If We Ever,2009

I don't like to hurt but but everyone gets weak
Someone to rely on that's what I really need

I've been through the pain and been dragged through the dirt
Whatever they tell you were bigger than words
I've been where your standing I know how it hurts

Because were survivors were making it work expecting the best when they hope for the worst

One love, even though they'll let you down
One love,nobody's perfect now
One love,don't let that hold you down

One love, its easy to believe in
One love, believe in you and me

They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
So wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Oh

Born to a throne, stronger than Rome
But violent prone, poor people zone
But it's my home, all I have known
Where I got grown, streets we would roam
Out of the darkness, I came the farthest
Among the hardest survival
Learn from these streets, it can be bleak
Except no defeat, surrender, retreat

So we struggling, fighting to eat and
We wondering when we'll be free
So we patiently we wait, for that fateful day
It's not far away, but for now we say

When I get older, I will be stronger
I'll make it better, struggle no longer
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag

Oh

So many wars (wars), settling scores (scores)
Bringing us promises, leaving us poor
And in the situation, when there's no compensation
They got no occupation, no buy no medication
See its a combination, of no education
We can never get it say, tomorrow's generation
'Cause they can't control us, no they can't hold us down
We gonna pick it up, even though we all struggling
Fighting to eat
And we wondering
When we'll be free
So we patiently (wait) for that faithful day (go)
It's not far away, but for now we say

When I get older, I will be stronger
I'll make it better, struggle no longer

Go out and smash it like oh my God
Jump off that sofa, let's get, get off

I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out spaced out and losing all control

Fill up my cup, Mazel Tov
Look at her dancing, just take it off
Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof, and then we'll do it again

Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it and do it, let's live it up
And do it and do it and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it

After tonight there'll be no me and you

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,
And I love it, wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you
No you ain't, come back
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em,
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em,
Now you're in each others face,
Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em,
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways,
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance,
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave,
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
You're the same as me, but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you,
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk,
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again

Though you think it's strange the way I hold it down
Know I know (I know you want it)
And I know (I know you know)
I got what you need
Some of my girls I hadn't seen in a while
Saw them at the mall and we traded hugs and a smile

They said we hear you're doing well
You seem so confident
I told them that it wasn't me but it was heaven sent
I saw confusion in their eyes
Said I'm living right no compromise
I don't talk I don't dress like I did before

And if you give me just a minute I will tell you more
I am not the same, God has changed the game
Found that it's okay, I don't have to live that way
I am not the same, God has changed the game
You know it's okay, you don't have to live that way",Different Now,2006
