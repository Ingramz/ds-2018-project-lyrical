With all of your mind?
Why give the stars
All so bright
Why did you have to, baby
Look so fine
When you knew all long
You could never be mine
It was the love in your eyes
And made me realized
I was one of those
Forbidden Nights

I tried to resist
But I was so long
I tried to tell you
It was wrong

Seems like when I got here you were still a child
Listen to me baby
I wanna let the tears fall, but that's not my style
Next time I see you, we'll be older
We'll be changed in ways we may not even see
We may grow apart instead of closer
That's why tonight, means everything to me
This may be the last time
Let's make it the best time
Maybe the last time
Let's make it the best time
Look at me baby
I wish I could answer all the questions in your eyes
What matters baby is that we look around
And be proud of how we spent our lives
Listen baby, I didn't get here by complaining
And I'll be leaving the same way that I came
In you I saw myself and for that I'm grateful
I'm going to make sure you remember my name

Heaven sing me a song, I don't care if it carries on
There's a place inside of my heart where nothing once belonged
Well come to the sky of that big jet plane to O-ri
Standing right at the gate in the shirt you left behind
Love keeps you falling, leaving you warning, with never enough
Love is some kind of monster, wanting to conquer, right where it hurts
Love kept us foolin' around
Love kept us foolin' around
Love kept us foolin' around

Darlene Love,"Do you love him?
Or is it still too soon to know?
When I think back a couple of days
Before I found you in his spell
Was there a warning?
What can I say?
Should I look away?
It's still too soon to know

Are you sorry
Or is it still to soon to know?
It didn't take much to break us in two
For it was in the way that he came close to touching you
The look in your eyes
I thought I recognised
It's still too soon to know

And it's still too soon to know
Will you stay or will you go?
It's still too soon to know

If I wasn't happy then
I never will be
I wonder was this ignorance or bliss

He's all I wanted all my life and even more
He smiled at me and the music started playing
Here comes the bride when he walked through the door
Today I met the boy I'm gonna marry
The boy who's life and dreams and love I want to share
The boy whose on my hand a band of gold will bear
The band of gold I always dreamed I'd wear

This time it wasn't just my imagination

Darlene Zschech,"Amazing grace! how sweet the sound. 
That saved a wretch like me! 
I once was lost, but now am found. 
Was blind but now I see. 

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear. 
And grace my fears relieved: 
How precious did that grace appear 
The hour I first believed! 

Through many dangers, toils and snares 
I have already come; 
'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far, 
And grace will lead me home. 

The Lord has promised good to me. 
His word my hope secures; 
He will my sheild and portion be 
As long as life endures. 

Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail, 
And mortal life shall cease, 
I shall possess within the veil 
A life of joy and peace. 

When I've been there ten thousand years, 
Bright shining as the sun, 
I've no less days to sing God's praise 
Than when I first begun.",Amazing Grace,2004
Darlene Zschech,"[Chorus ]
You are the love of my life
You are the hope that I cling to
You mean more than this world to me 
I wouldn't trade you for silver or gold
I wouldn't trade you for riches untold.
You are , you are my everything

I wouldn't take one step without you 
I could never go on.
I couldn't breathe on breath without you.
I don't have the strength 
To make it on my own

[Chorus]
Until the world stops turning 
Until the stars fade, from the sky
Until the sun stops striving
I need you in my life and here's the reason why!",You Are,2005

Of the beauty and the glory of Your presence

As I seek You, You will find me

There is nothing that compares to You my God

As I seek You, You will find me
As You draw me to yourself

You're my friend here, Holy Spirit
Speak to me dear, Holy Spirit
Tenderness that makes me hold every breath
And to need You more

My searching heart was seeking for a place to find the home
And though the baddest toils I ask You in
You Love me in to life and more this fullness now I know
That I am Yours forever and You are mine
You are mine, You are mine, You are mine

In Your presence I will dwell
Love will hold me till I see You face to face

To last for long
Never fool myself
That my dreams will come true

Being used to trouble
I'd anticipate it
But all the same I hate it
Wouldn't you

So what happens now
(Another suitcase in another hall)
So what happens now
(Take your picture off another wall)
Where am I going to
(You'll get by you always have before)
Where am I going to

Time and time again
I've said that I don't care
That I'm immune to gloom
That I'm hard through and through

But every time it matters
All my words desert me
So anyone can hurt me
And they do

So what happens now
(Another suitcase in another hall)
So what happens now
(Take your picture off another wall)
Where am I going to
(You'll get by you always have before)
Where am I going to

Call in three months time
And I'll be fine I know
Well maybe not that fine
But I'll survive anyhow

I won't recall the names and places
Of the sad occasions
But that's no consolation
Here and now

So what happens now

So what happens now

Just die?

but love grows old, and waxes cold
and fades away like morning dew

There is a ship, she sails the sea
she's loaded deep as deep can be
but not as deep as the love I'm in

Places I can call home, places I can get stoned

People wanna knock me down, 'cuz they never have their own
They won't get the best of me, but they try hopelessly
Why you wanna fuck wit' me? I'm not, what you s'posed to be

You did not give a damn, coulda just killed a man
Sawed off in my hand, but I had to kill the plan

If I Ever Love Again

( Written by Curtis Wright / Billy Spencer )


I felt a little uneasy when you walked in

But I'm glad you agreed to see me once again

If for no one's sake but mine

While I've got the chance this time

I want to tell you just what a fool I've been



There have been a lot of changes in my life

And there's a long list of wrongs I'm making right

But of all the things I've done

Hurting you is still the one

Mistake that I keep making in my dreams every night



Chorus:

But if I ever love again

I know one thing for sure

That if I ever love again

It won't be like before

Cause losing you's the price I paid

To learn that love is only made to give

If I ever love again



When I think about the man I used to be

It's no wonder that you just gave up on me

But standing here today

I just want to say

It's my belief in what we had that finally set me free



Chorus:

And if I ever love again

I know one thing for sure

That if I ever love again

It won't be like before

Cause losing you's the price I paid

To learn that love is only made to give

If I ever love again



If I ever love again, I'll tell you honestly

I'll do my best to love her just the way that you loved me



Chorus:

And if I ever love again

I promise you for sure

That if I ever love again

It won't be like before

Cause losing you's the price I paid

To learn that love is only made to give

If I ever love again



If I ever love again

""I hope you freeze"", was all she said
Slept out in my truck with my heater on
Hey Roy, oh boy, throw me a bone

[Chorus]

I woke up with a fever and a runny nose
I'm a housebroken baby, I do what I'm told
I won't ever stray, ever roam
Hush honey, honey hush, throw me a bone

Daron Norwood,"There are songs that bring back memories
That's what good songs do
I remember this one playing
On the night that I met you
You sang it to me in the moonlight
No voice ever sounded that way
Yes the melody that we danced to
Haunts me to this day


Chorus:
I hear it in the street, I hear it in the car
It's on every button that I've pushed so far
I can't turn it off, I can't walk away
The next time I hear that song play
I'm gonna do what I should've done long ago
Whoa, I'm gonna break the radio


It takes a lot to make me angry
I've never been a violent man
But I'm gonna start carrying a hammer
And keeping it close at hand
If silence really is golden
I don't need and on/off switch
No this ball peen hammer I'm a holdin'
Is about to make me rich


Chorus:
I hear it in the street, I hear it in the car
It's on every button that I've pushed so far

I'm gonna do what I should've done long ago
Whoa, I'm gonna break the radio


Sparks are gonna fly out
The music's gonna die out
The DJ's gonna cry out loud

Daron Norwood,"I find myself sitting here again
Surrounded by souvenirs
Letters and cards and tear-stained photographs

I'm holding matches in my hand
Got a log in the fireplace
All that I need to turn old dreams to ash

But I can't strike that match
I'm not sure I'm over looking back
I tell myself I won't hold on to the past, this can't last
But I can't strike that match

Here's one of you and me out west
The Rockies belonged to us
We always said that one day we would return

Here's that written statement of our love
Signed by the county clerk
Just a piece of paper that would easily burn

But I can't strike that match
I'm not sure I'm over looking back
I tell myself I won't hold on to the past, this can't last
But I can't strike that match

Holding on is killing me, girl I know I need to let go
Just set fire to memories, and watch us go up in smoke

But I can't strike that match
I'm not sure I'm over looking back
I tell myself I won't hold on to the past, this can't last
But I can't strike that match

My Girl Friday

( Written by Curtis Wright / Carl Jackson )


She stands there with her suitcase

We've been through all this before

I know it's gonna hurt me

When she walks out the door

I wish things could be different

We didn't have to say goodbye

But someone else is in the picture

And we don't see eye to eye



The minute that she leaves here

She'll run straight to their arms

Gotta find the strength to let her go

Even though it breaks my heart

One last time I'll hold her tightly

And kiss her on the cheek

As she rushes to the car I'm left

To face the lonely week



Chorus:

She's my girl Friday as far as I'm concerned

I'm lost without her, don't know which way to turn

Thursday takes forever and Monday comes too soon

But at least she's my girl Friday 'til Sunday afternoon



She stands up in the backseat

And softly waves goodbye

I look away before I want to

She don't need to see my cry

I know that I'd go crazy

If it wasn't for the fact

I'll always be her daddy

And they'll have to bring her back



Chorus:

She's my girl Friday as far as I'm concerned

I'm lost without her, don't know which way to turn

Thursday takes forever and Monday comes too soon

But at least she's my girl Friday 'til Sunday afternoon



Yeah she's my girl Friday 'til Sunday afternoon

'Til Sunday afternoon


",My Girl Friday,1995
Daron Norwood,"Well, I see you still remember our old number
No, there's no one here but me tonight
And I guess you're gonna talk about your problems
In your never-ending search for Mr. Right

Well you say them single bars are awful crowded
With all the fools, the fashions, and the fads
And 'tween the pickup lines, the cheap wine, and the losers
Sometimes you almost want what we once had
Girl, you think you've got it bad

Well, try getting over you
If you want something hard to do
I can't believe you'd call me up
Just to say you've got it rough
Girl, you haven't got a clue
Try getting over you

So it's another Friday night with all its troubles
Where to go and what you're gonna wear
And you've got to pick your lipstick and your high heels
And figure out someway to fix your hair
Lord the burden that you bear

Try getting over you
If you want something hard to do
I can't believe you'd call me up
Just to say you've got it rough
Girl, you haven't got a clue
Try standing in my place
Where the tears roll down your face
Come and take one bitter taste
Of the hell I'm going through
And try getting over you

Try standing in my place
Where the tears roll down your face
Come and take one bitter taste
Of the hell I'm going through
And try getting over you

Try getting over you
Try getting over you
Try it baby",Try Getting over You,1995
Daron Norwood,"Tall and lean, sexy Dorene parted them swinging doors
She was holding hands with some honky tonk man, no one had ever seen before
She was Bubba Jones's girl, his whole world
Never knew a man as mean or as strong
There was bound to be trouble when she burst Bubba's bubble
And he found out she was doing him wrong
Then right about ten Bubba walked in, the crowd did a double take
You could've heard a heartbreak

[Chorus]
You could've heard a pin drop, even the jukebox stopped
No clinking glass, no belly laughs, no whispers, no small talk
Just silence all around and that little cracking sound
That only one thing makes, you could've heard a heartbreak

We thought for sure when he saw her there was gonna be hell to pay
I said hurry someone dial 911, get an ambulance on its way
Then he dropped to his knees, said, ""Come back please. 
I'm sorry that I treated you bad.""
Like a small earthquake he began to shake, never seen a sight so sad
She said, ""I've had enough. 
I've fallen in love. Boy it's just to late.""
You could've heard a heartbreak

[Chorus: x2]

That only one thing makes, you could've heard a heartbreak

Didn't I

Didn't I do it baby
Didn't I do right
Why you wanna leave me baby
Didn't I treat you right

I bought you diamond rings
Everything, that a woman could need
I bought you cars, clothes, a home
When things were rough for me I kept on
And I am back again

Didn't I

There's something wrong with you
Tell me
Bring me all your troubles dear
You look bad, you should be glad
Your leading man, always be glad, sit by home
And let me kiss your lovely lips

Didn't I do it baby
Didn't I do right
Why you wanna leave me baby

We have time for criticism

For building fortunes and passing judgments
When will there be a time to love

At this point in history we have a choice to make
To either walk a path of love
Or be crippled by our hate

We have time to cause pollution
We have time to cause confusion

When will there be a time to love

While we cause mother earth so much pain

Not enough money for
The young, the old and the poor
But for war there is always more
When will there be a time to love

We make time for paying taxes
Or paying bills and buying status
But we will pay the consequences
If we don't make the time to love

Darrein Safron,"I got a story to tell
'Bout when I ginormously fell
Won't say no names though
'Cause it ain't no game bro
And it ain't no angle making no woof tickets for me to sell
It's about to, buddies in the middle of a bout too
A lady on the daily putting out two
One of the buddies she told him never let his mouth spew
Don't let your bro know what's happening
'Cause we were together, plus shacking in
That's what you call gettin' back at friends
Shoulda told him I was tapping in

I was 21
She was 40-something, say she wanna give me some
So I started putting Tecca Nina in the lungs
Of the photographer that my homie, then he brung
But it was a catch, he didn't want a nigga to rack
'Cause her and my homie were together, he'd give her the scratch
After every photo-shoot but he'd have a bitter attack
If he knew his colleague would shoot me then deliver the snatch
So I kept her secret like a dummy keeping it professional
I didn't tell my homie but I was full of regret you know?
Riding out with my homie, out my mouth ain't no decibels
But when she finished flicking me, we bang out on the sectional
I used to throw him hints saying ""I really wanna smash her""
Then he would look at me like I was doing it with laughter saying
""She would never do it, I don't know what you after
Out of your league, man you young, broke and plus you a rapper""
Damn

Bros become foes yeah (bros become foes)
Lord knows the lovin' was fly though
It ain't worth livin' these lies though
On my dog (On my dog, on my dog)
Yeah
I should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him
(That I was tappin' in)
I should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him
('Cause he was a best friend)
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
That ain't never what you do to best friends

She would pick me up for photo sessions
But I didn't tell my homie we were low-low sexin'
Man this lady had a body like she was SoloFlex'n
So right after work, she let me give her a pogo lesson
No confession never told him, I was grindin'
On his workin' roommate, I was slimin'
But I messed up and told my other homie
But when me and him fell out he told my best friend that I was lyin' all this time
And then my homie said
Why is you playin' me, I'm hearing too many rumors
Yo you got something to say to me, man?
You know about my affection for that woman that stay with me
You supposed to be my homie, why you fuckin' and fakin'?
And then I gotta hear from someone else
You selfish man all you think about is your fuckin' self
You and her be together, I don't need no one's help
I'm feel like I'm finna lose it, I don't know what I'ma do
But I swear to
Hold on my nigga, you can't be callin' me trippin
I'm with my family and I don't know what the hell you talkin' 'bout that's fuckin' insanity man
Why you lyin' to me bro, you know these people be talkin'
And their stories sound the same and you makin' it awkward
And I ain't finna be the type to act like this don't really hurts
What am I supposed to do 'bout it when I'm at work?
You and her, we supposed to be brothers that make it worse
And he told me everything y'all be doin' don't do me dirt
Don't deny it homie, really you oversteppin' your turf
Told me y'all was snappin' photos and you removin' her skirt
Even said you shoulda known this fuckin' chick was a flirt
Well how you gonna believe every damn thing he say?
Dog you for real? You shoulda told me without delay
We was like fam, now you got me dealin' with hearsay
And everything that he say, she say
Oh, I gotta go

Bros become foes yeah (bros become foes)
Lord knows the lovin' was fly though
It ain't worth livin' these lies though
On my dog (On my dog, on my dog)
Yeah
I should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him
(That I was tappin' in)
I should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him
('Cause he was a best friend)
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
That ain't never what you do to best friends

So that is how me and my best friend fell out
'Cause I told another homie something he had to yell out
All of our business ventures and dreams was the hell out
And I'm left with underhanded things that I can tell 'bout
Lost my best friend, 'cause I was young and dumb
He lost his life to another brother with a gun
I never got to tell him that I was sorry, I was sprung
My other homie just died of cancer, I'm numb
So the moral of the story is
Don't lie to get something that you really want
Always keep it real, though a lot of people don't
That's why they always in funk

Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
That ain't never what you do to best friends",Tappin' In,2018

That rainbow in the air
Whenever I came close it just seemed to disappear
I had to change my point of view

What about the children
To ignore is so easy
So many innocent children would choose the wrong way
So what about the children
Remember when we were children
And if not for those who loved us and who cared enough to show
us
Where would we be today

Sir, where is your son
Where lies his refuge
And if he can't come to you, then where can he run
Such a foolish girl, yet still, she's your daughter
And if you will just reminisce your days of young
You see, it's not where you've been, nor what you've done
Because I know a friend who specializes in great outcomes
See His love overcomes

I knew every word and every note to that Martha White hour theme song

Well my folks took a vacation down to Nashville, Tennessee
Bought me a Goo Goo Cluster and a front row seat to the Grand Ol' Opry
And there before my childish eyes was that high and lonesome sound
But nowhere on that Opry stage was Martha to be found
Well I finally found my Martha out in the Opry stars' parking lot
She was cooling off them up and coming boys
You see they were Billboard hot and they were 
drinking something out of a brown paper bag
I knew I'd lost my Martha the only love I'd ever had

Oh, they're all better looking than the ones who went before
Same old hat, same old voice
Can they give us nothing more?
They're all smiling for the cameras, walking softly, talking loud
Martha, she still makes those biscuits greasy, fluffy and proud
You got your French croissant and all that Italian pastry-chef voodoo
You just pop one of them suckers in your mouth, slivate and chew
But what you won't find on the shelves of the finer kitchens of the world
Is the face of our self-promoting, self-perpetuating, self-rising flour girl

You only get it in the southland
That's where demographics best
It's the brand that Mom and Daddy bought | They won't give the girl a rest
And it's the same as it ever was from fifty years ago
She ain't mortal like you and me
Martha White will never grow old

They're all better looking than the ones who went before
Same old hat, same old voice
Can they give us nothing more?

For the finest biscuits ever was get Martha White self-rising flour

Darrell Scott,"Old Joe Clark he made his mark when cotton was king
And late at night 'neath the shanty light you could hear that banjo ring
It would ring out for the master who was listening on the hill
And it would ring out for the babies who were sleeping quiet and still

Round and round old Joe Clark
Round and round, I say
Round and round old Joe Clark until the break of day

When he came out of the belly of that ship of 
Slavery he was holding to his banjo but it was not on his knee
And someone said, ""Hey here's a strong one and he can entertain
So we'll let you keep your banjo, but Clark's gonna be your name""

Round and round old Joe Clark
Play it when I say
Round and round old Joe Clark or they'll carry you away
Round and round

He learned to play the melodies of Cork and county Claire
He even played for Lincoln once, outside the courthouse square
Then he went down to New Orleans, they call it Dixieland
But everywhere that old Joe played, he was still a hired hand
Round and round",Banjo Clark,1997
Darrell Scott,"Head south in the morning, just take off with no warning
Tell your boss you need a change of scene
Head south if you're feeling your homesick heart is reeling
And get yourself a bowl of butterbeans

Anywhere east of the Rio Grande
Gets you a cane pole in your hand
Fry a mess of fish up on the bank
Cross that Mason-Dixon line, leave your cares and worries behind
Sit out under a willow tree and think
Head south, are you listening
You don't know what you're missing
From Virginia shores to the Gulf of Mexico
Head south to Kentucky, Blue Ridge Mountains if you're lucky
From the Florida Keys to the banks of the Ohio
You will feel the heart of Texas swing Dixieland down in New Orleans

Country soul down in Tennessee
And that mountain music's all right by me
Hot jambalaya you're in the land of Hank

I'd get a picture in our rubber suits so that everyone would know

I'd build a fire every evening and listen to the whipporwill

To a farm where Big Richland River winds 
And I'll bet they danced them a jig, and they laughed and sang a new song

Darrell Scott,"A farmboy from Kentucky Hills
Learned to play guitar for his backpoarch thrills
Lean a ladderback chair on a windowsill
And look out at the stars
He must have got it up in Michigan
He and his brothers were pickin then
When he moved to Gary he took it with him
That Gibson Hummingbird guitar

Oh how that guitar would ring
Dad would close his eyes and sing
Silver Haired Daddy would always bring a tear to his eyes

I was all of five years old
My brother Don and a kid down the road
We just did what we was told to get outside and play
Someone wrapped it in a coat
And we took it to the swamp just to see if it'd float
But a Hummingbird is not a boat
And it sank straight away

When he got home that's when he heard
What we'd done to that Hummingbird
And he looked at me and never said a word
Just went out back to see

And there it was in all it's mess
With the cattails and the redwing nests
And there he laid it down to rest for all eternity

One of these days you know what I'll do
Get a Hummingbird guitar and a brother or two
Underneath a Kentucky moon, give him back his childhood dream
It won't make up for thirty-two years
And it won't dry up a swamp of tears
But it's better than a case of beer and a fifth of Jim Beam",The Hummingbird,1999
Darrell Scott,"This is the song that nobody knows
I couldn't begin to describe how it goes
But it makes me cry and laugh right out loud
It's the song I sing when there's no one around

This is the man that nobody sees
He wears my old clothes and he looks just like me
And if he learned how to fly he'd never touch down
It's the man I am when there's no one around

It's four in the morning, I'm lying in bed
With a tape of my failures playing inside my head
The hardknocks and heartaches, things I don't know
I listen and wonder, where will it go?

This is aglimpse of the child within
He's so immature but he's still my best friend
He's just one of the boys who gets lost in a crowd
It's the kid I am when there's no one around

And it leads my steps to higher ground

Five rooms, five rooms
Full of hope when love blooms
Now it's empty as a tomb

A place for dirty dishes and forgotten recipes
I don't sleep in the bedroom, now I'm all alone

In the glare of the bathroom mirror's reflection

For wealth and what it can buy

And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
Deny my God and doom my soul

What good is gold and silver too
When your heart is not good and true?

I'm not gonna forget you,
I'm always gonna know your name
I'll be feelin' you in my fingers
And lovin' you just the same

You led me through the doorway of an old log cabin there
I ran my hands along the wall, sat down on the fallen stairs

The wind was every wind
I cried a peaceful river, cause I know you're still my friend

Darrell Scott,"Went out one night to make a little round,
I met little Sadie and I shot her down
Went back home and I got into bed
Forty four smokeless under my head

Woke up the next morning bout half past nine
The hacks and the buggies all standin in line
The gents and the gamblers standing around
Taking little Sadie to her buryin ground

I began to think what a deed I done,
Grabbed my hat and away I run
I made a good run but a little too slow
They overtook me in Jericho

I was standin on the corner readin my bill
When up stepped the sheriff of Thomasville
He said young man ain't your name Browne
Remember the night you shot Sadie down

I said yes sir my name is Lee
I murdered little Sadie in the first degree
First degree and the second degree
If you have any papers won't you read em to me

They took me downtown, dressed me in black
Put me on the train and started me back
Locked me up in that Thomasville jail
I had no money for to go my bail

The judge and the jury they made their stand
The judge had the paper in his right hand,
He said forty one days, forty one nights
Forty one years to wear the ball and the stripes

Darrell Scott,"He left Boston in December for New Mexico
Determined to forget all of the faces he'd known
A little lonesome and a world of troubled mind

With a bed roll on his shoulder and a banjo on his knee
He would hitch a ride with truckers, he believed them to be free
Eighteen wheelers roll a little further down the line

He did not meet a girl in Richmond nor in old San Antone
His vision of the Southwest would be realized alone
Alone to wonder how his life had gone thus far

As he walked along the highway
He felt a power from inside
He found a miracle of living
In having nothing left to hide

He walked Carlsbad to White Sands
For forty days and nights
But it only took ten minutes for that man to realize
Lord, it's lonesome everywhere

Now he's living back in Boston, teaching English in high school
Glad to have bi weekly wages
Glad the kids all think he's cool
He's a man who has learned from where he's been

He keeps a bottle full of white sand on his table down the hall
And a worn map of New Mexico thumb tacked on the wall
Oh, you never know, he may need to go again

As he walks along the hallway
He feels that power swell up from inside
And finds a miracle of living
In having nothing left to hide
Oh, it's a miracle

",Miracle of Living,2003
Darrell Scott,"It's been rainy and windy for seven days straight
I've been going to bed early and getting up late
I look out my window and it's one shade of gray
My wife and my kids don't have much to say
A man out of work only gets in the way

Oh, the river is rising now one inch an hour
And tonight we'll be lucky if we still have power
But I've got a flashlight, an oil lamp and I'm ready to go
And a fresh set of batteries for my son's radio
If the dam really breaks, least we'll know where to go

River take me, river take me
River take me far from troubled times
River take me, river take me
River take me far from troubled times

If I had a boat you know what I'd do
I'd float me and my family down to Baton Rouge
I wouldn't work in no factory, I'd live off the land
And live within means of my own two hands
Dance Saturday nights to a Zydeco band

Oh, the river flows and a young man dreams
And the river can drown you or it can wash you clean
It can take you away to some other place
It can power your cities, carry your waste
And give all that you drink, a peculiar taste

Oh, don't look to me, I've done my time
You see, I've had too many dreams for this one heart of mine
And I've stood on the bridge with the river below
Feeling all of the sadness that a proud man could hold
Oh, the river is full but there's no way to go

Darrell Scott,"He was not my father’s brother
But he wished that he could be
Told us kids to call him Uncle
And we would be his family

He had a wife and kids in Fresno
The youngest one was twenty-four
Dad had brought him into our house
But they didn’t want him anymore

He helped us work the family business
Building fences in the sun
And worked just like a man of twenty
Till the working day was done

He and Dad would spend their evening
Sitting in lawn, chairs in the yard
Where they’d drink a toast to Seagram’s
Seagram’s never went down hard

Won’t you wake up, Uncle Lloyd
Got a lot of work today
We’ll get Don to make the coffee
Load that truck and be on your way

Friday night you can drive to Vegas
Maybe this time you will win
Buy a trailer by the river
And you won’t have to work again

He was sleeping in the workroom
With a mattress on the floor
When one night I heard him crying
As I passed outside his door

He cried, ""Rita, girl, I love you
Rita, darling, please don’t go
I’ve tried hard to make you happy
I’ve done everything I know""

Then I heard the bottle open
The tipping up and putting down
Heard the rustling of the covers
And then he did not make a sound

I thought of thirty years of Rita
Standing sternly by his side
All the years of hanging in there
And all the emptiness inside

And I thought of how their children
Have children of their own
And how a man at fifty-seven
Winds up living so alone

Won’t you wake up, Uncle Lloyd
Got a lot of work today
We’ll get Don to make the coffee
Load that truck and be on your way

Friday night you can drive to Vegas
Maybe this time you will win
Buy a trailer by the river

Darrell Scott,"Now the flames they followed joan of arc
As she came riding through the dark;
No moon to keep her armour bright,
No man to get her through this very smoky night.
She said, I'm tired of the war,
I want the kind of work I had before,
A wedding dress or something white
To wear upon my swollen appetite.

Well, I'm glad to hear you talk this way,
You know I've watched you riding every day
And something in me yearns to win
Such a cold and lonesome heroine.
And who are you? she sternly spoke
To the one beneath the smoke.
Why, I'm fire, he replied,
And I love your solitude, I love your pride.

Then fire, make your body cold,
I'm going to give you mine to hold,
Saying this she climbed inside
To be his one, to be his only bride.
And deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of joan of arc,
And high above the wedding guests
He hung the ashes of her wedding dress.

It was deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of joan of arc,
And then she clearly understood
If he was fire, oh then she must be wood.

I saw the glory in her eye.

And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long long way from home and I miss my loved one so
In the early morning rain with no place to go

Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go
And I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold wind blows
That old liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
Well, there she goes my friend, she's rolling now at last

Here the mighty engine roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound, high above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying o'er my home in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
And I'm stuck here on the ground, as cold and drunk as I can be
You can't jump a jet plane like you can a freight train
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain

Yeah, I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain

",Early Morning Rain,2012
Darrell Scott,"Made up my mind to go
Some place so far away, I headed west
Without a sad goodbye
No hugs or tears that way, it's probably for the best
Sent cards along the way
Said I was looking for a brand new life
I never settled down
My wanderlust would always cut the ties like a knife
Sometimes the lonesome wind
Calls out just like it knows me
And on a night like this
When I don't know where to go, he shows me the way

He knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away

I always looked ahead
I was so afraid that I'd be caught behind
Followed a crooked stream
To places I'd never seen and one more highway sign
Just like some other guys
I count the hours 'til the day will end
But it's not so I can rest
For me it's the time that's best for talking to my friend

Cause he knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away

Now half my life is gone
The only home I have is open road
My skin is cracked and brown
A mirror to the dessert ground and the dusty wind that blows
I never made a mark
Just scattered footsteps on the shifting sand
Whatever pushes me
It's something only he can understand

He knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away",Brother Wind,2013

It's fun, rain, hail or sun
It's squash

It'll either kill or cure ya

Before the morning sky fades
Up to blue

I wish that somehow I could find a pill
For a quick fix modern tonic that would change me with one swallow I would kill

I dreamed that we were traveling on a bus
Speeding along an unnamed plain towards somewhere and nowhere there was us
Our hands lay useless in our laps
Like beetles on their backs

We came to a stretch of road where a fire
Had burned the edges all along it looked as though the highway wore eyeliner
You kissed me by surprise
When I opened my eyes
You'd turned into some old guy
I screamed

If looks could be pickled and stored in a jar

1997 trapped inside a conversation
That party was so loud I felt like an abbreviation of myself

Finally got around to vacating the nest
But my knowledge of survival was pedestrian at best 

Now I'm holding down a job penning poems by the kilo

Tie shoes in bows
Walk tall in those

Don't start counting your pennies; the night is but a pup

And you will marvel at how it's so easy to forget

Corroded over time

So I stop to look around
Maybe it was just sleight of sound
It's just me and my bare knees
Power lines and trees

But one hint is more than enough
It starts with a sniffle and a cough
When posters have stopped falling off my wall
The winter takes fall

All of these past regrets
Are faded signs of missing pets

Why don't I just pick up the phone and call?
The winter kills fall

And all of these fledglings that you've found
And given homes
Will hunger for the new
And colorful

They shone like car keys to a baby

Or practice disco dance

We practice love between these sheets
The candy sweetness scent of you
It bathes my skin I'm stained by you
And all I have to do is hold you
There's a racing in my heart
I am barely touching you

Turn the lights down low
Take it off
Let me show
My love for you
Insatiable
Turn me on
Never stop
want to taste every drop
My love for you

The moonlight plays upon your skin
A kiss that lingers takes me in
I fall asleep inside of you
There are no words
There's only truth
Breathe in Breathe out
There is no sound
We move together up and down
We levitate our bodies soar
Our feet don't even touch the floor
And nobody knows you like I do
The world doesn't understand
But I grow stronger in your hands

Turn the lights down low
Take it off
Let me show

want to taste every drop

We never sleep we're always holdin' hands
Kissin' for hours talkin' makin' plans

Just being in the same room
We never sleep there's just so much to do
Too much to say
Can't close my eyes when I'm with you
Insatiable the way I'm loving you

Creepin up on you 
Is the wrong thing to do
I found your address
Got your phone number too.
Visit all the stores where you buy all your clothes
Been to secret places you think nobody knows
If I have to live without you
Nobody could
I need to be around you, watching you

I know that it would be right 
If I stayed all night
Just to be around you

Creepin up on you
I been hanging around all the places you haunt
Spying on your friends to find out what you want 
Drinking from a glass that you left on the bar
Follow you around driving home in your car
Do I have to breathe without you
Cause nobody could
I need to be around you, watching you

It can't go on
This kind of thing is taking all my sanity
And making me a mockery

Bring my baby closer to me

I guess my eyes adjusted
To the lack of light
I got
Covered in darkness
Covered in darkness

Always waiting for something new
Happiness has always ended
In the blink of an eye
There was no one attending
No one attending

It doesn't really matter where it all began
All I know
I got covered in darkness
Covered in darkness
Ever wonder why I never really truly connect

I can hold your gaze
But I am never connected
Never connected

I am famous for my generosity
They say I am the kindest
But it is easier to
Give than receive love
Give than receive love

It doesn't really matter where it all began
All I know
I was covered in darkness
Covered in darkness

Turning pages over
Run away to nowhere
And it's hard to take control
When your enemy's old and afraid of you
You'll discover that the monster you were running from
Is the monster in you

Better to hold on to love
Better to hold on to love
Change will come

It doesn't really matter where it all began

And I don't know what's wrong with me
I don't know what's wrong with me
The clouds cover up the Dublin sky
I don't know what's left of me
I don't know what's right with me
And I've tried to keep my distance
And I've sung Amazing Grace
I've tarnished all our memories
But there'll always be a trace of you
Of you

I remember laughing on that river's edge
Trying to get you to jump with me
Trying to get you to fall for me
And your trembling heart it beat so fast
Holdings hands you promised me
Holding hands we counted to three
And I felt your slipping fingers
And I saw you change your mind
If I hadn't dragged you in with me
You would have let me dive without you
Without you

They sent you all the way from Hollywood
And maybe that Dublin sky was changing you
It put diamonds in your eyes
I always thought we were going to make it through
But I wanted to hear it first from you

How many days am I going to regret you?
How many nights till I forget you?
Have I been wasting all those years?
Held down by these tears?
How many dreams have I left deserted?
How many hopes have been diverted?
Have I been buried in the dirt?
Held down by this hurt?

How many loads did I let you hijack?
How many ways can I stand here in playback?
How did I end up lying here
Crying underneath the Dublin sky?

How many days am I going to regret you?
How many nights till I forget you?

Karmically I seek retribution
Looking for love in physical beauty
Desire is the drug of the bourgeoisie

Like a glimmer of good in a bad man's eyes

I know temptation taunts the empty

So pour yourself over me
Until there's nothing left to see, yeah yeah
Because I like the way you move in the dark
I like the tension, the tension and the spark

The decadence of giving into desire
Creates such entropy within
Looking for love in spiritual faces
Blind to the art of fabrication
I'm like a baby sucking mama's milk
Want to drink my fill and then some
Leave me alone
I always thought I was better than this
But temptation tempts the temptee

Pour yourself over me

It's two ends of a spectrum
Are you a friend or lover
Now pick one or the other

Love and attraction
It's like joy and sadness
It's like peace and conflict
You can chase them forever are they ever together?

Everybody wants someone to hold
Everybody wants to choose a role
Ain't nobody willing to break a mold
No hint of bravery
Everybody chasing some ideal
None of it obtainable none of it real

I had your back, I held you up, I told you you were good enough

You fed your love to me like crumbs to pigeons in the park
Sometimes I think you're satisfied to see me begging like a dog
I wasn't armored, you were king, I gave my everything
Because sometimes you showed me just a hint of you and then
For just a moment I romanticized the notion
I can take away the torment, I can love you like they never did

Who will try to wash away the stain that love has left us?

There is nothing I can say 
There are no good words left anyway 
Besides people look cool and the world still moves without you, oh 

Welcome to my Californian home 
You don't have to call me you can leave when you want 
There's a picture by my bed 
There's a light in your eyes

Well I don't know 
Why you still feel alone 

And we were dying from the get go 
I was dreaming but you never believed 
I was trying to fit myself in the spaces between, oh

There's no phrase that hits
Like an ocean needs the sand
Or a dirty old shoe that fits
And if all the world was perfect
I would only ever want to see your scars
You know they can have their universe
We'll be in the dirt designing stars

And darlin' you know
You make me feel so beautiful
Nowhere else in the world I wanna be
You make me feel so beautiful

Whether I'm up or down
There's no crowd to please
I'm like a faith without a clause to believe in it
And if all the world was smiling
I would only ever want to see your frown
You know they can sail away in sunsets
We'll be right here stranded on the ground
Just happy to be found

You make me feel so beautiful
Nowhere else in the world I wanna be
You make me feel so beautiful

I have lost my illusions
I have drowned in your words
I have left my confusion to a cynical world
I am throwing myself at things I don't understand
Discover enlightenment holding your hand

You are

Yeah darlin' you know!
That you make me feel so beautiful",So Beautiful,2005
Darren Hayes,"Everybody's beautiful
When they're young
And I should know
I've had more than my share of fun

There's all this fascination
With the impossibly thin
With the surface of things
Airbrush Photoshop creation

In all that we are losing
Aren't we just confusing
Youth with beauty
Truth with duty?

There's something on the telly 'bout North Korea
Some war broke out, don't trust the media
I'd like to get a suntan
Some dude was shot in Pakistan

They've got those bombs up in the trains

They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't want to talk about it

I was walking through the city
Past a phone shop and a homeless man
Was lying there, looked almost dead
And no one seemed to bother

I ran into a rock 'n' roll band
Two or three of them, maybe four
This one punk just nineteen years old
He gave me his persuasion

He stared at me with his one black eye
Looked down on me like I didn't have a life
And he was right
At least not the kinda life he'd been paradin'

Same sex union
Change the constitution
You can carry a gun
But you better not fall in love with someone

The President who fucked the world
For every future boy and girl
Is golfing in Aruba
With a suntan and scuba

The track's got noddage
Moves my boddage
The track's got noddage
Moves my boddage

Moves my boddage
Moves my boddage
Moves my boddage
Moves my boddage

They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't want to talk about it

They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't want to talk about it

Now everybody dies or fades away
A permutation white and gray
A synergy of light and dust
And skin cells constantly aging

You fell in love with the dream
To fuck forever endlessly
But you don't, that's okay
The rest is better anyway

Botox bungle, CNN
Infomercial count to ten
Change the channel, VCR
Somethin' on my radar

The track's got noddage
Moves my boddage
The track's got noddage

They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face

Of my selfish difficult stage
When our eyes first met there was deja-vu

Pass the planes, and trains, and satellite navigation
Pass the time I spent today
Through the nearest wormhole
In a stunning ball
Of white
The light explodes and lands on you

And you're five
Always running away
And I was dying to kiss you
And I
I don't want to cry
I don't want to see
Where the moving van takes you
So I travel on
Beyond the stars
At one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles per second
I can fly
Forward a few years
To nineteen hundred and seventy nine
I caught a glimpse of the sky

They're coming down the road
They're coming to get me
I never should have come
I hide the time machine
I'm running down the hall
I think I'm in my old house

Pass the place where I grew up
Number nine Lake Road
Pass the swimming pool
And Mable park
And past Troy Clifford's house
To the Argonaut ?
To the fish and chip shop
Out the back and down the road
To the place I got beat up

Hey, put that rock down
Can't you see he's half your size?
Hey, he looks familiar
Oh my god, he's me, age nine

Put your shoes on
And run away from here
I can't get involved
This is all so weird
I'm meeting myself
This is all so clear

All the things I've lost
All the people I've hurt
All the times I lied
All the moments wasted
All I never did
All the dreams I had
All the things I would change
I can change them

All the things I've lost
All the people I've hurt
All the times I lied
All the moments wasted

I'm gonna make right
What I did wrong
And change how the future has come
Through appliance of science
I'll take a hold of my enemies
Take their obscenities
Kiss them, and leave them like lovers who've gone
I'll call my dad
I'll tell him I miss him
And tell my reflection: 'it's not your fault'
And now the moment has come
I'm traveling back in time

They're running down the hall
I've started the countdown
They want me to stop
But I don't think so
I'm ready to go
Let's get the job done

Put your shoes on and
Run away from here
I can't get involved
This is all so weird (It's me aged nine)

Darren Hayes,"Long ago when mercury descended high on the moon
Far below when little hands are making shapes in the room
The shadows they dance and they cheer up this place

The face that's staring through a tiny crack in the door
Eyes so wide, he's never seen a woman fall on the floor
I swear daddy's killed her this time

Should I make a rocket?
Should I try to fly away?
Should I make a hammer?
Should I try to smash his face?

Should I make a bullet?
Should I try to shoot the gun?
I'm sure the judge will let me off real soon

Long ago when saturn tried to find a way past the sun
Deep inside a little boy is turning pain into fun
The pencils, the crayons, the paint colors run

The plans are forming slowly made with scissors and glue
Eyes so wide, he's telling mommy all the things he can do
He'll sketch a contraption to save them for sure

He can draw an alien
He can come and take them home
He can draw a cartoon
He can draw a safety hatch

He can draw a hot bath
He can plug a toaster in
And wait till daddy's nice and warm
Toss it in

And then when he's gone
There's a neverland of fun

Take a loaded gun
Take a shot of rum
Take a poison rat
There's a lesson in that

No more closing fist
No more face to hit
No more bloody nose
Or apologetic roses

Long ago when mercury descended high above the moon
(Should I make a rocket? Should I try to fly away?)
Far below little hands are making shapes in the room
(Should I make a hammer? Should I try to smash his face?)

Long ago when saturn tried to find a way past the sun

Deep inside a little boy is turning pain into fun

Darren Hayes,"A serpent, a rabbit, a walk in the forest
A tentative looking sun
A feeling, a moment, a bursting of bubbles
A panic to overcome

A samurai, an angel, an etiquette table
An AC that does not work
A road trip, a car wreck, a paperback novel
A lover who ain't been hurt, damn it

When you let me go, when I'm on my way
When the world below is cold and gray
On the verge of, on the verge of something wonderful
A resurgence on the edge of something wonderful

For it, against it, said he'd never meant it
But Harry still dropped the bomb
A trip to the dentist, the Hollywood black list
A moment that time forgot

When you let me go, when I'm on my way
When the world below is cold and gray
On the verge of, on the verge of something wonderful
At the edge of, on the verge of something wonderful

You can dance in the devil's shoes if you like walking in heels
And there's a decent living to be made in the selling out of ideals
You can lose your way in the big city
Get distracted and lost and feel pretty

I want you, I need you
I don't wanna please you or belong to anyone
But life is for leading, for not people pleasing
A race that has never been won

To the blur of a bicycle wheel

To a fluorescent light that ignites and displays

High above, over Notting Hill
I am floating still, in a wooden chair, with our restless dog.

Been away so long, I almost forgot how time and space
Cannot replace this feeling of flying over things.
Now you're falling awake, your sleepy face begins to register
That I'm coming home- yeah, I'm coming home to you.

On a Sunday only we know, where the sunlight and the wind blows.
Over bluebells, over Blackheath.
Calling your name, I will float through your window.

Major third, or a minor seventh
I'm a violin tuned a little sharp, tuned a little below.

Coming around the bend, the hallway ends.
The chair it dips, and then it bends
And it has wings for legs.
Now you're deep in a dream, the sheets and pillowcases seem to overtake your head.
I'm at the foot of our bed.

Break through the silence, the gulf that's between us.
Take all the heartache and bullshit that builds up.
And we will unravel, unravel the moments.

And a bit of a truck

Won't part with a singular bit of enlightenment
Bang, crash, glitter, and bug

No preliminary sketches
Or advice to impart in me

Gotta fashion a skeleton key

Been in tragedy never hurt
Somehow this man became a boy
You took the blame but 
Maybe I was wrong

Just picking up the pieces of what lies behind those sorrowful eyes
You can walk away 

You have been silent for so long I let the world know
I turned a bit of my pain into a song then carried on

You took my shame but maybe that was wrong


Walk away now and be gone

Even when they?re killing you
You don?t always have to be so strong for me

Even Judas planned to just carry on
Just picking up the pieces of what lies behind those sorrowful eyes

Now and be strong
I know you can carry on 
Walk away now and be gone
Cause you don?t have to want to carry all the pain inside you
Cause the blood in me is your blood every time I fall

Walk away now and be gone
Even when its killing you
You don?t always have to be, so strong for me
Walk away now and be gone
Cause you know even Judas planned to just carry on
Still picking up the pieces of what lies behind those sorrowful eyes
You can walk away

And now and be strong
You don?t have to carry on

Walk away now and be strong

You don?t have to wanna go on

Walk away now and be strong
You don?t have to wanna go on

Walk away
Walk away now
Walk away now 
Ooohh

You don?t have to go on
You don?t have to be strong
Walk away now

You can walk away

Give me a medicine
Teach me a lesson, maybe I deserve to know

With the contents of your pretty little head

Give me one thing
Tell me something I don't really need to know
I am so afraid of breaking what we made
It is delicate and lovely
But it's a weight above me

And your words are like weapons
But you'll keep them inside
They cut like a knife
And you keep it together
Those feelings inside
There's nowhere to hide but away from me
And I just wanna listen to your words

I'd like to step into your world
Show me a secret
I promise to keep it safe and sheltered from the storm
I would cross the great divide that keeps me swimming
Treading water from your shore

Now I wanna coax you from your hell
Into an alley, the hidden valley
Where the truth can surely spill
I wanna take the weight that drags you to the ground
Spare this treasure that I found

And you keep it together

They took it away from me
Somewhere that no one can read ya
I see a bible
I see a bible in your eyes
All those codes and hidden meanings
Full of metaphor
and something for the faithless in me

That as every second passes there's a moment gone,
In 23 hours the sun is gonna set forever,
Would you hug a little tighter,
Would you let go first,
Would you focus on love then forget the hurt,
Live in the moment or wish your life away,
How would you spend you last night on Earth,
Would you kiss your enemies,
Say sorry first,
Would you take enough time to say your last goodbye,
All the little battles that you never won,
All the music and the opera never sung,
Emotions that were silent all these years,

Because this is the last night on Earth,

What if I told you that I had regrets,
I would trade in all my happiness for one last kiss,
For a minute or two lying by your side,
What I chose a road no-body walked,
If I arted all my promises with empty talk,
If I knew back then the things that I know now,
I would tell you that I love you then we'd all get low
There are Peaks and there are Valley's,
You've got to know,
Second chance,
You've really comes around

You can't smell the roses when you're gone,

You can't smell the roses when you're gone,
So live every moment like this is the last night on Earth,
cuz this is the last night on Earth,

If I could have my time again,
I would make sure,
You knew just how I felt,
cuz I went away for much too long,
And the seasons change,
Without me,

You can't smell the roses,
No it's not a rehearsal,

Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
I'm beggin' you please
Come back to me

To live my life as one
Friends tell me to hold on
Tough times don't last for long
My abandoned heart
Just doesn't understand
My undying love for you
Won't let me wait

We're the dance among the drunklegs, a contest between
Untied lace, pop-shoegaze, and 808 heartbreak
We both caught the pace of two hearts, offbeat

What will hold you when the dance is through?
Put your back against the wall
Follow syncopated water fountain conversation
Making love inside a crayon covered bathroom stall
What if I don't find you, take you there?
I only want what I can't have
If you love me, give me nothing
Nothing

Some simple math
Two I can add
I ain't writing it down
I remember now what you came for, where your aim is
Maintain it
Try to burn the right glow
I'll be on my way out
I'll be over soon
Sober later
Fire that only I'd know
You've been on my radar
Are you lonely too?
'Cause your coast is clear to get a hold on me

And on these walls another language we would never speak

If the fire dies down we'll build another
If we just do that this love won't fade

Up where heaven had no more secrets to conceal
And still you found the ground beneath your wheels

And then retreat
To that dark place where no one else may follow
I waited here for your returning
To roll your cigarette
And wash your bloodied feet

Of my dreams
Broke me from the grip of grief and fever
With the sound of your voice speaking my name
And a kiss
That I will feel forever

On a hard and holy road
We lay down our head
In tha hour of gold, the hour oi lead

The wall of death
And when il finally breaks you and you fall 
I will tear this dress of muslin that you gave me 
To bind the fatal wound 
And catch your last sweet breath

In the hour of gold, the hour of lead
We did forge our wedding bed
On a hard and holy road
We lay down our head
In the hour of gold, the hour of lead

They excavate my heart 
And find the image of your face 
Imprinted there like some Shroud of Turin

To cross on 1he mountain my fortune to win

You are my shelter through storm and through strife

For a treasure not ever so fine or so fair 
As the flash of her smile or the touch of her fingers 
The fire in her heart and the smell of her hair 

She left me a note that cried ""Do not weep for me 
Behold you are with me as sure as the stars 
That rise in the evening to shine down upon me 
Behold I am with you wherever you are""

They're circling low and inside tonight
It's another round in the losing fight
Out along the great divide tonight

We are aging soldiers in an ancient war
Seeking out some half remembered shore
We drink our fill and still we thirst for more
Asking if there's no heaven what is this hunger for?

Our path is worn our feet are poorly shod
We lift up our prayer against the odds
And fear the silence is the voice of God 

And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah

Sorrow is constant and the joys are brief
The seasons come and bring no sweet relief
Time is a brutal but a careless thief
Who takes our lot but leaves behind the grief

It is the heart that kills us in the end
Just one more old broken bone that cannot mend
As it was now and ever shall be amen

And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah

So there'll be no guiding light for you and me
We are not sailors lost out on the sea
We were always headed toward eternity
Hoping for a glimpse of Gaililee

Like falling stars from the universe we are hurled
Down through the long loneliness of the world
Until we behold the pain become the pearl

Darryl Johnson,"Me and my best friend Lillian
And her blue tick hound dog Gideon,
Sittin on the front porch cooling in the shade
Singin every song the radio played
Waitin for the Alabama sun to go down
Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town
Me and Lillian
Just across the line and a little southeast of Meridian.

She loved her brother I remember back when
He was fixin up a '49 Indian
He told her 'Little sister, gonna ride the wind
Up around the moon and back again""
He never got farther than Vietnam,
I was standin there with her when the telegram come
For Lillian.
Now he's lyin somewhere about a million miles from Meridian.

She said there's not much hope for a red dirt girl
Somewhere out there is a great big world
That's where I'm bound
And the stars might fall on Alabama
But one of these days I'm gonna swing
My hammer down
Away from this red dirt town
I'm gonna make a joyful sound

She grew up tall and she grew up thin
Buried that old dog Gideon
By a crepe myrtle bush in the back of the yard,
Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hard
Got in trouble with a boy from town
Figured that she might as well settle down
So she dug right in
Across a red dirt line just a little south east from Meridian

She tried hard to love him but it never did take
It was just another way for the heart to break
So she dug right in.
But one thing they don't tell you about the blues
When you got em
You keep on falling cause there ain't no bottom
There ain't know end.
At least not for Lillian

Nobody knows when she started her skid,
She was only twenty seven and she had five kids.
Coulda' been the whiskey,
Coulda been the pills,
Coulda been the dream she was trying to kill.
But there won't be a mention in the news of the world
About the life and the death of a red dirt girl
Names Lillian
Who never got any farther across the line than Meridian.

Now the stars still fall on Alabama
Tonight she finally laid
That hammer down
Without a sound
In the red dirt ground",Red Dirt Girl,2000

Wide open down a two-lane highway
It's about time that some things went my way
Throwing troubles out to the wind and
I'm praying that they never catch up again
I'm gonna say my worrying days are done
And this looks like a good day to run

My baby's been working as a cashier
She didn't get a vacation this past year
Now it won't be long
We don't need no destination
Just a tank of gas and a good clear station
Playing our favorite song
There're some places that we ain't been
Some things we ain't done
And it sure looks like a good day to run

I know this storm is bound to pass
That ol' sun is gonna shine again tomorrow

Left the pieces on the floor

Until my eyes met yours

Everywhere I go it seems folks
Can't get close enough
Is the whole world in love
Or is it just us

When you walk with your head down
All you see's the cold hard ground
But I looked up in time to catch a glimpse of you
If everyone on God's green earth
Knew true love and what it's worth
They'd know how I'm feeling
And share my point of view 'cause

So I'm gonna anchor down and wait till it comes around
Leave the rest of the world behind, that's how I'll pass the time

Till I catch my second wind, get back up and gain control again
Find the strength I lost back when you stopped loving me
I guess I'll just stay out here until I know the coast is clear
Sit and watch the tide roll in till I catch my second wind

There's a peace in the way I feel when the water's still
And as long as it's calm out here I've got time to kill
But as soon as it starts to stir I'll lose track of the way things were
Float away on the open air, but I'm not going anywhere

Oh but I survived

Has lost its shine

The ghostly forms of blue and gray
And I can almost hear the cannons blast
Standin' in the presence of the past

The first few waves came cheerin'
Fear and hatred runnin' through their blood
When the day was finally over
Those left wadin' through a crimson flood
To think I could be right here
In the spot where some young soldier breathed his last
Standin' in the presence of the past

Father fightin' son

Looked like the South had won
Now my mouth's as dry as cotton
And my heart is beatin' fast
Standin' in the presence of the past

Sunrise caught the rebels sleepin' and they woke 
To hear a Yankee bugle blow
Bullets flew like angry hornets
Till the peach tree blossoms drifted down like snow
It must have been like hell on earth
What happened here is more than we can grasp
Standin' in the presence of the past

Getting out of that noose
You had on me

Free
Feels a lot better that I thought it would
Free
Never knew it felt so good

Free to think what I wanna think
Free to come up with my own plan
I'm gonna get myself a big ol' drink
Celebrate being my own man
Hanging out in this redneck bar
It's all good as far as I can see.

Free
Feels a lot better than I thought it would
Free
Never knew it felt so good to be

I've been wrapped up tied down
Been lost but I found
I'm the kind of man that needs to be free

Darryl Worley,"The first thing I did when that plane finally landed was kiss the ground
The next thing I did was to go find my friends down at the old hangout
Drank some beer and talked a lot about old times
But when the booze finally hit Billy Joe Grimes
He said, 'I don't know what it is, but you seem different to me.'

I said, 'I just came back from a place where they hated me 
And everything I stand for
A land where our brothers are dying for others who don't even care anymore
If I'm not exactly the same good old boy that you ran around with before
I just came back from a war.'

The very next morning I took a walk through the neighborhood
I thought it's been so long since I've been in a place where everything is good
People laughing and children were playing
And as I watched 'em, I found myself praying
Lord, keep 'em safe here at home in the land of the free

'Cause I just came back from a place where they hated me
And everything I stand for
A land where our brothers are dying for others who don't even care anymore
If I'm not same little freckle-faced boy
That grew up in that house next door
I just came back from a war

I hope you cherish this sweet way of life
And I hope you know that it comes with a price

I just came back from a place where they hated me
And everything I stand for
A land where our brothers are dying for others who don't even care anymore
Chances are I never will be the same

And my poor mother sat between'em both all night

And how my life is like a roller coaster ride

As they echo through out our land
For all his friends who gave us all
Who stood the ground and took the fall
To help their fellow man

Love your country and live with pride
And don't forget those who died America can't you see

All gave some and some gave all
And some stood through for the red, white and blue
And some had to fall
And if you ever think of me
Think of all your liberties and recall
Some gave all

And if you ever think of me
Think of all your liberties and recall, yes recall
Some gave all

Some gave all",Some Gave All,2011

My eyes watch God from a place
Where times is hard, hard times we embrace
Everybody want a yard, cuz a yard means space
Being broke is odd and leaves an odd taste
In the mouth of the metropolitan
The hustle is hollarin'
Beautiful minds grind, grind for the dollarin'
Whether dice scholarin' or white collarin'
We all taught hustle to prophet like Solomon
The young play corners, Sean Jean modelin'
They get it from they momma, black music is fatherin'
Blue and whites flash lights like parliment
In court non-whites, wishin' they had Cocharan
Tell your guy and them, yo the blocks hot again
Aunties walking to liquor stores in moccasains
My guy got a gig, on the side he barberin'
Married a foreign chick so she could get a green card up in the hustle

[Chorus: Common (Omar)]
Just put it in your back and hustle
The paper's stacked so hustle
(Gon'! Gon' get it and get me that
Gon'! Gon' get it and get me that
Just move, and shake, and grind and hustle
It's on your mind so hustle
(Gon'! Gon' get it and get me that)
Gon'! Gon' get it and get me that

[Dart Chillz]
First to the third, I'm close to the curb
Toast to the bird, now I'm posted to serve
Heard is a verb when you pour dirt on the floor
Bill collectors and the roaches working your nerves
It's a ghetto truck for a ghetto boy
To get in them ghetto streets and get him a ghetto toys
So he can come so just work murder rate is increasin'
I don't give a fuck long as my coke is decent
And my rims blind the whole damn precinct
Every time you see a head in my lap you know she sinked
I know I'm dead in this trap, that's not how we think
Fifty shells all around on the ground, can't catch a weak blink
Five went through me, two stayed in me to do my duty
Only thing that subdued me
Two weeks, same corner, new freaks
New geese, all white AND 1's new sneaks

Some rhyme, some throw shows, some sow clothes
Some hobo at the junction inbetween cars
Some enter in functions inbetween stars
Some teach, some preach saying they seen God
Some put they money up, against me odds
Flippin' real estate yo, stocks and bonds
Dreams of rollin El Derado's bumpin' El DeBarge
Whatever the dreams, stay on ya deem the world is ours, its the hustle

From the jump niggas know, it's Yellowstone for life
Tap a nigga dome, act a phone with the right
It's a four car collision, when my chrome hit the light
X-ray vision, when I size niggas up
See two wheels fall off, when I ride nigga what
two four, three sixty five, hugging the block
I'm in the hundred, Trae in the six, Doug in a drop
Letting it up letting it down, hauling the tops
Two pigeons on the dashboard, snub in the spot
Since you got your mask on dog, mug my dot

Some niggas chase paper, some niggas try it
Some niggas want a piece, some want the pie
Some niggas wanna skeet, me I want a lot

Rated by these pit bulls, and these untamed guerillas

So niggas better get the picture, if not then you long gone
Throw your motherfucking set up, 'fore you get your chest gone

And ducking from the S.L.A.B.er, wood grain when I grab a
Drop it trunk knocker, on choppas looking for boppers

You had me on the phone, but hate me when I come there

Yeah, yeah, just like that
I hope I hope you go deaf so you can't hear shit
Yeah, I hope I hope you go blind

Maybe you should wonder why your apartment is always so empty
(Maybe you should wonder that)
Well I hope you get locked out of that apartment and have to call Jenny
(Oh, I hope you get locked out)

Cause everday oughta be a bad day for you
Everday oughta be a bad day for you

She's way too complex
When we argue, she takin' shit out of context
And, I know I could have did more
But I'm never home, I was always on tour
I could be anywhere in the world, had one wish
To be with you until you gave that dude a tongue kiss
And this is hard for me to say like a tongue twist
My heart don't beat for you so let the drum hit
And, you know I just got promoted
Now I be the boss and I hope you get demoted
Happiness is a warm gun, live it fully loaded
And shit got worse when I exploded
Boom, I wrote it soon, I hope you brought a cab pay
And I hope you get detention on a half day
I wish I could use your blouse for an ashtray
Cause for you, everyday should be a bad day

Everday oughta be a bad day for you

As the chains of the flesh left me
As the moans and the groans
Of the friend sent me
On my way to the Land of the Dead
I flashed ... that my soul was Unharmed
As my earth form I shed
That the image of death had been
A thought in my head
And the truth was a spirit am I
I sussed ... that my life had been a lesson
Chosed by me
For to purify my Soul that I may be
Worthy to shine forth the Light
The Light
The Light
As I moved ever up-ward
A Great Light there came
More feeling than seeing
And it filled me with Shame
Like a Bright Shining mirror reflecting my being
My present condition of Soul I was seeing
I Beheld ... Forms of Great Beauty
That shone forth the Light
With love vibes they met me
A cast off my fright
Those great souls of Ages long passed
I praised the Great Souls of the Ages
Who care for our needs
Who lovingly nurture
Wisdom's bright seed
Showing the way to the Light
The Light
The Light
I ached ... for the womb and the Earth
And another time around
Seking circumstances
The best that can be found
To give me the lessons to learn
I was Born ... and through childhood
My soul still rembembered the Light
And through teens I fought fiercely
For my vision of the Light
When I saw Mum and Dad had forgot
The Light, The Light, The Light!

A frozen sacrifice, your body's heat's my paradise
I've built up many layers but none can keep me warm
Deceiving is believing in the calm before the storm

We complicate our lives with things to define
I threw it all away to see what was mine
Cleared out my insides, echoing hollow
I'll forever wallow, in your footsteps I follow

Warily I search for solidarity
In our disparity, your love for me was charity
This is reality, for all that it's worth
If you're not perfect then I just don't belong on this earth

And just like a disease
All the faces I see remind me of you

'Cause they seem just like you, wanna reach out, touch you
All I have is me, all I want is you, they seem just like you
Why can't I forget you all I have in me is this memory
Fading alone

I'm an array of imperfections on display
My life has been on layaway since the day you went away
I've watched myself decay, the ripe is turning rotten
Feeling nostalgic, now you're gone but not forgotten

I lack luster, what was new has turned to rust
I'm filled up with disgust, wish the world would turn to dust
It's hard to readjust 'cause now I find it strange
To trust in something that will constantly change

A long range exchange, for years I've sought you
The pain I've brought you, you've taught me what I've taught you
We can't escape ourselves or even one another

Stepping over those under me like concrete

Smaller than gnomes, shatter your thoughts like Britte Bones
Crushing feeble domes like El Nino did to mobile homes
Lamp posts get ripped apart when I envade with my tirade
Like cat in the hat during the Macy's Day parade

I'm over coming obstacles like Jeremy McGrath
Those who used to raise an eyebrow, kowtow
Had no respect for you then, got no respect for you know

You went from Verbose to Coatose, silent as the chief
Our time is brief, I hope no one forgets me
Goals to achieve before I leave like Gretzky

More when it came to you

Forever filling a void
Something I cannot avoid
Everytime I'm put together
I'm being destroyed

So when you come around
You'll find me on the ground
Searching for a piece
That I never found

I feel so stupid, friends knew it, turned to it
I'm by myself, I'm bound to be

I can't find what I'm missing
I've lost myself, I hope that you're listening
I've seen my puzzle taken apart
It's hard to start again

But with you, all I knew was the filth
That you put me through

I'm sick reliving the past
My time it came and it passed
I'm holding on to the memories
Making them last

So when you come around
You'll find me on the ground
Searching for a piece
That I never found

Filled my heart with broken glass
To make this thing last

Help me to go away

Cold spreads throughout my body like cancer
Consumed by a question, innately question the answer
An entrancer, traveling for truth portal to portal
To quell the parallel, heaven and hell, are we immortal?
A stepping stone of flesh and bone

A body loaned to serve our own
To atone is the undertone, don't postpone
'Cause death keeps ringing like the telephone

I don't know if there's something I'm forgetting

She doesn't stop, the torment hands me ways to make peace

Love was limited, pain and struggle were fixtures
I view you as I knew you, reflecting like a mirror
My eyes are the windows to your soul, becoming clearer

Without a trace of time and space
I see your face, an angel's face
You and I just can't erase
The meeting at your resting place
And now I know what direction I am headin'

I was thinkin' of days gone by
Of the times I've had,
And the things that I've left behind

Some change,
Some die,
Still we manage to survive
It's knowin' when and what to do
It's up to you
Don't know what's goin' on,
I can't wait 'til

One summer,
I'll find a way
One summer,
Will always remain
One summer,
Remember the way

Hauled down
Turned around,
Find myself facin' the wall
I think back to school,
It's all the same,
Slightly different rules
Outside on your own,
Watch yourself 'cause you're all alone
I know what's going on,
I can't wait 'til

One summer,
I'll find a way
One summer,
Will always remain
One summer,
Remember the way
One summer,
Never the same

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I think back not far, 
Drivin' down the beach in my car
Another place,
Same time,
Icky runs along a fine line
Down there,
No chance,
He's trapped in a different romaance
He's life a fait accompli,
He never did see

One summer, 
I'll find a way
One summer, 
Will always remain

Daryl Braithwaite,"Your love
Love is all around me
Everywhere
Love has come to touch my soul
With someone who really cares
No one can deny us
People who once passed me by
Will turn their heads
I'm happy just to be with you
And lovin' you the way I do
Is everything I need to know
Just restin' in the afterglow (of your fire/love)

You
Yes, you have always been here
A feelin' deep inside
A feelin' that I could not see
Or touch, or try to hide
My love is in and without you
I bless the day that I found you
So listen baby
I'm happy just to be with you

Keeps turning out (all) the things that we said

How can I be sure where I stand with you?

Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
I wanna die 'cause you know I wanna stay with you.
How do I know?  Maybe you're trying to use me.
Flying too high can confuse me.  Touch me but don't take me down.

Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
My alibi is telling people I don't care for you.
Maybe I'm just hanging around with my head up upside down.
It's a pity, I can't seem to find someone who's as pretty
 and lovely as you.

Daryl Braithwaite,"The dawn is breaking, out on a back track, the sun is cutting through like a knife.
He knows the morning, the smell of the diesel, another day in a young mans life,
And he wears the dust, he's one of us.

The New Bush is here, a turn of the page, there's talk around the town, for better days
You can see it in their eyes real as the Sun, a quiet revolutions begun, in the new bush.

Her hands are wailing, and she's on a mission, handed down from father to son,
She knows the country, respects the old ways, she kick it in and get the job done
In these changing times, she holds the line.

For every miracle manifested, great or small I praise You 
Yet there is one thing my heart desires 
Is to worship You each day without fail 
This is my earnest prayer, this is my earnest plea 
Bid me, come ye beyond the veil 

For every door now opened, every pathway cleared. Lord I thank You 
For every one of my needs, You've already supplied, I praise You 
Yet there is one thing my soul longs for Is to worship You face to face 
This is my earnest prayer, this is my earnest plea 
Bid me, come ye beyond the veil 

Beyond the veil is where I witness all Your glory 
Seated on your throne in majesty and power 
I lay prostrate before You, Oh my King 
In this place of sweet communion 
This is my earnest prayer, this is my earnest plea 
Bid me, come ye beyond the veil 

I have entered Your gates with thanksgiving 
I've entered Your courts with praise 
Yet I hear You say, Come closer Step into this Holy place 
And because the blood of Christ for me 
It continues to prevail 
Now I'm standing in Your presence, face to face

Fond of angling, fonder of dangling his feet in the cool brook water
While the Reverend's daughter
Sat at his side and fluttered his face with the fuzz of a dandelion.

Time for his lesson

As much as he hated it, the preacher was teachin' him to play the accordion.
""Don't go Georgie!"" said the Reverend's daughter
""When Daddy comes lookin' we can duck in the water.""

But the girl caught her locket on an underwater branch
And the next thing she knew, she died

You're content to rely on the talented guy

And take all of the credit for the song

Won't you stop what you're doing
And start doing something

'Cause he can't get to sleep at all
And his favorite book, by the T.V. Light
Can't stop this matinee, he's played it over and over

And he can't stop the music
Or remember the ending to his song
He played it much too long

All those hard earned words, that he's fought from his pen
Have been forgotten in some empty hall
And those wide eyed looks, on those wiped out faces
Make some dreams of their places over and over

And he can't stop the music
Or remember the ending to his song
He played it much too long

Wouldn't believe in years
If he told you what the papers use to say
But that was in his hey day

Get back in his prime he had the fans in line
You should have seen him then
Now look at him

His hair is getting thin
There's one last show before the glory ends
There in the wings, waits his only friend
The record that he's prayed to over and over

And he can't stop the music
Or remember the ending to his song
He played it much too long

Now, he can't stop the music, oh no

I could count on you to make my life a little brighter
I always thought you were built to last
But I never saw anything fall apart so fast

It's so hard to be in love with you
It's so hard to be in love with you
It's so hard to be in love with you
It's so hard to be in love with you
",Hard to Be in Love with You,1980
