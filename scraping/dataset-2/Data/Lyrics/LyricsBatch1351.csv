Who my man is, who the fam' is 
All that bullshit you talk? Can it, we own the planet 
It's a definite, niggas over money, reppin' it

Lil' Cease, commin' at'cha 
For the year 2000 and the new millennium, Uh 

Fuck all you hoes, I blows like suits 
Bitches don't shake my hand, they salute the lieutenant 
Rich men kiss the back of the hand of the royal highness 
Pocohontas, Mafia's behind us, ballin' like Utah 
Didn't think a ghetto bitch could come this far 
From pushin' Buicks to candy apple red Jaguars 
Bitch think I'm rich, I could rock a fool blue suit 
A furry Kangol with some cowboy boots 
And still be the shit of the night 
When I come through 
You be on the side holdin' ya cups like the bums do 
Waitin' for the Queen to put some change in it 
I pull out a 'G' and drop it with a hundred grand left in my pocket 
I promoted this shit, so I got's to make a profit 
And all the ends are sins to my men's, down his prophet 
Me and Lil' Cease, it's part two, me partners 
Layin' niggas down like carpenters 
So pardon us, like Nike's, we just do it 
We ain't amateurs to this shit, we used to it 
And all the bodies I killed, keep 'em on file 
So when they anniversaries come, we pop Cristall 
Ask Bristal, the Golden Child, ta-dow 
Take it how I gives it, you talk it, you live it 
And don't forget it, bitches

The music that we hear is always standing near to feed us.

Good vibrations that we make will come bouncing back.

Bristol,"My Angel! Clipped wings, I know.
Wanders in darkness, on grimy ground.
In a forest, unclean, unsound.
Everything, everything's gone wild.
Make land for the cows to graze,
leaflets scatter around to advertise.
Sellout

A swamp, in it hands streched out
to catch a passing dime.
Donations to the rich,
widened opavements for the poor,
somewhere else to lie.
But my friend the carriage door
stands slightly ajar,
and I know clipped wings make uneasy flight,
but we've gotta reach!

A place where the feast never ends,
when the music celebrates.
In a time when darkness belongs
to night's skies and
nothing else.

Tomorrow my spirit's seen,
fears today my mind,
soul aches to deep,
always craves my body to reach

All the lights they were laughin' at me
In the spotlight you can see the scar

You're the nightmare that's in my dreams
You get up to take another blast now
You're the flies in my potions and creams

Flying so high that I could not come down
I would sing every song you ever heard now
Hit every spot in this one-horse town

Bitchin' over shit you ain't gettin' 
So finally, puttin' in work, the big hurt 
MC, with a social disease, and get it first 
Enemies, feel my energies, four centuries of anger 
Remember me? (The field nigga!) 
Too Ghetto Fabulous, RZA Sharp, and hazardous 
Figure, with bad habit, can't hold his liquor 
Speed like a millipede (Hot Nix-on) 
Contemplate the non-fiction on loose leaves 
Paragraphs, hundred degrees, my pen bleed (ha!) 
Howin' you the pain I feel from holdin' these 
Black thoughts, deep rooted, nowadays 
They come with batteries included, in wicked ways 

Who them niggaz that be rollin' them thai, high as a kite? 
Gettin' pussy all night (well all right cha) yeah yeah 
Well who them cats you can call on, when you want to brawl? 
(Get drunk as hell) and so on (well all right cha) yo yo 
Is Funk Diggy in the house? (well all right cha) yo yo 
Meth Diggy no doubt! (well all right cha)

Goodbye to the memories, goodbye to the dream
Didn't know I’d have to find my way back
Can I just let this be?
Goodbye to the memories, goodbye to the dream
Didn't know I’d have to find my way back
Can I just let this be?

Somewhere down the road I guess we took a wrong turn
I took your pictures, lit a match and watch them all burn
I can’t take anymore break ups, or make ups
So straight up, I won’t be there tomorrow when you wake up
But wait up, listen baby girl don’t get it twisted
We gave it all we had, attempted everything to fix it
Another broken heart, I can’t risk it
Girl its plain is simple, we took a shot and we missed it
And now the place I piss in, is where the memories of us are livin'
Down the drain, no more pain
But baby I ain’t kidding, when I tell you that you’ll always have a place in my life
But tonight I’ma make it right
Yeah, I’ma say

[Chorus]

Yeah, I guess I’m back at square 1,
Our love is rare, it’s too bad it wasn’t well done
Yeah we had a good run, never reached the finish line
Wish that we could start again, wish we could go back in time
Wish we could have seen the future, now we’re history
Consistently sending me text, saying that you’re missing me
I’m tryina forget about you, baby girl you’re killing me
And when you hear that last line, you’ll probably be pissed at me
But what can you, girl I’m tryna do me
Clean, slate, fresh start, baby I’m a new me
I promise that you’ll always have a place in my life
But tonight I’ma make it right
Yeah, I’ma say

[Chorus]

Somewhere down the road I guess we took a wrong turn
I took your pictures, lit a match and watch them all burn
Somewhere down the road I guess we took a wrong turn
I took your pictures, lit a match and watch them all burn
I watched them all burn

He started touching me and kissing me
Like he didn't care
I thought at first I should go home
But then fell asleep in the chair

It makes me tremble

Got a little messy, early mornin'
Can't be like that anymore, no

I was shaking my ass in the streets all morning
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump bump till the break of dawn
And it don't stop till the early mornin'
Passed out on the couch and yawning
Just walked in and it's early morning
Bump bump till the break of dawn
And it don't stop till the early mornin'

Met a tall dude, kinda dark hair
When he walked up somebody grabbed him
But I liked him told him to come here
Kinda cool baby we can make plans
Where you live does your mama live there
We can hook up at the hotel he was down
So I told him, let's go, what happened next?
Guess, but, you don't want to know

I was shaking my ass in the streets this morning
Just walked in and it's early morning
Bump bump till the break of dawn
It don't stop till the early mornin'
Passed out on the couch and yawning
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump bump till the break of dawn
It don't stop till the early mornin'

Oh, I went out and I approached him
But we couldn't get with his friends
There's something bout him, I'm sure
So I said what the hell let's go
Got up, got on the dance floor
Hooked up with a guy named Joe
When the music was fast and slow
What happened next, guess
But, you don't want to know

I was shaking my ass in the streets this morning
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump bumpk till the break of dawn
It don't stop till the early mornin'

Call all your girls
Call all your friends
Let's do it again
Let's do it again

I light your fire your one desire
Pull on me baby and I'll take you higher
You should try it so come over here and let's go some

About Mona Lisa and how she suddenly fell
See everyone knew her, they knew her oh so well
Now I am taking over to release her from her spell

She's the original
She's unforgettable
She wants you to know
She's been gone

It's kind of incredible
She's so unpredictable
She wants you to know
She's been gone, she's been gone, she's been gone

She was taken under drowning in her sea
Running like an angel, she was crying and could not see, oh no
Now see everyone's watching as she starts to fall
They want her to breakdown be a legend of her fall

But where the FUCK is the waitress at wit my drinks?!
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door and break em in
The owner already pissed cause we sorta late
But our time and our clothes gotta coordinate
Most girls lookin right some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over ya dress
But Louie Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickies all over ya chest
C'mon! we going party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scurred, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system the harder to fight!

Stand up! Stand up!
Stand up! Stand up!

Damn right the Fire Marshall wanna shut us down
Get us out so someone can gun us down
We was two songs away from getting some cutta
Now we one song away from tearing the club up
Move over! Luda got something to say
Do it now cause 'tomorrow' ain't promised 'today'
Work wit me! let's become one with the beat
And don't worry bout me stepping all over ya feet

Britney Spears,"Yeah nigga, I'm still fuckin with ya
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E, '99 Nigga (Guess who's back)
Still, still doing that shit, Andre?

Oh for sho', check me out
It's still Dre Day nigga, A.K. nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? My last album was ""The Chronic"" (nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

If you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police (Uh huh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (fo sho)
Still got love for the streets, repping two one three (fo life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing fifty a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
It's ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back

So if you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

When I see you, I stu-utter
Watch you slip away like butterflies

I saw you standin' there
In the VIP on Friday
We conversate up in my
Fantasies like, every day
But I'm a dud
Whenever you approach
Like yesterday when you just
Came to say hello

I forgot my name
I forgot my telephone number
If he wanna see me
He don't even know it
I forgot my address

When we touch, I melt like butter

I saw you standin' there
In the VIP on Saturday
Now that I know you got a
Thing for me, I should be straight
Not the kinda girl who'll just let
Any guy get close
I like him so I'm gon' tell my guy

Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong
Why carry on without me

Everytime I try to fly I fall, without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see, you in my dreams, I see your face
It's haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I make-believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done
You seem to move on easy

And Everytime I try to fly I fall, without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see, you in my dreams I see your face
Your haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry

At night I pray
That soon your face will fade away

And Everytime I try to fly I fall, without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see, you in my dreams, I see your face
Your haunting me

Lost in the world out of me myself and I

At the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter
For the man to pour the coffee
And he fills it only halfway
And before I even argue
He is looking out the window
At somebody coming in

It is always nice to see you
Says the man behind the counter
To the woman who has come in
She is shaking her umbrella
And I look the other way
As they are kissing their hellos
I'm pretending not to see them
Instead, I pour the milk

Everybody's welcome
Come on, come on in
Sit yourself down
The funnies never end
Love is the drug
That makes you want to drink
Till the morning after, oh

I open up the paper
There's a story of an actor
Who had died while he was drinking
It was no one I had heard of
And I'm turning to the horoscope
Looking for the funnies

Cunt trendy to the core
Debt cold and you're the door
I choke your drowning tea
Your black death skies swallow all of me

Wash me away

Debt blood and brick and boil
Slit out to fuck you Coil
Dilapidated tree
Your mash face monster color of me

You said you want me in command.
Oh, oh won't you calm down.
Oh, please settle down.

And hung round like echoes 
Or ripples on a pond
So you circled the globe 
Spent a year on the road
Without ever going home
More than a couple of days
Then you leave right away
Run to a girl you barely know
But you like how she sings 
And you can't help but think
That there's something that she knows 
And could teach you

Well you're sleeping in that southern state 
Where the bars are filled 
With people you can't hate
But try as you try 
You still can't relate to them
You drink that whiskey down 
As they ask you:
Are you who you say you are?
The fact that we can't tell
Makes us like you even more

So now you're trying again 
Or just visiting friends
One had just had his heart broke
For the first time in his life 
He realized there are times
When you can't make it alone
So now you are giving advice 
As if you had the right
To use a word like love
It's a negotiable term
What gets said's not what is heard
So it's different then for everyone

But you've been hanging 
Around that college town
With your new life
Your new lover you found
And you are keeping her up at night 
Bringing her down

But won't ask you
Is this really what you want?

Got no self control,
I'm always beggin' into telephones.
And then I,
I bought a little from my brother's friend,
Yeah, well just to get me by.
I don't trust his cup,
The effect's never as high as the markup.
I think I'll print it in the personals,
That I'm looking for a match.

Someone to burn the proof of the things that I've done.

skip like a stone.
I just crawl in a bag,
I'm gonna live my life like somebody's shadow.
I know I'm lazy with the little things,
I mean I never held a door.
But I still loved you more,
Then anyone; Since or before
You're always saying that I owe you one,
Well lets consolidate this debt.
Get on a payment plan,
I'll pay compliments, you can still treat me bad.
But, now this isn't getting easier,
to leave you and this town behind.
I'll do some travelin',

Britt Nicole,"Little girl terrified
She'd leave her room if only bruises would heal
A home is no place to hide
Her heart is breaking from the pain that she feels

Every day's the same
She fights to find her way
She hurts, she breaks, she hides
And tries to pray

She wonders why
Does anyone ever hear her when she cries

Today she's turning sixteen
Everyone singing, but she can't seem to smile
They never get past arms length
How could they act like everything is alright?

Pulling down her long sleeves
To cover all the memories that scars leave
She says, ""maybe making me bleed
Will be the answer that could wash the slate clean""

We say it's only living
Like life is only pain
I see heartbreak on every face
Hurt we can't erase
Dreams that fade away
Like we're all just lost at sea

We need, we need an answer, a hope
And an end to the searching
We need, we need a portrait of grace
Just one steady thing
In a world that aches
In a world that breaks

Somehow before life began
You saw broken man
But You had a perfect plan
You would send your only Son
The Holy gift of love
And He would be enough
To erase all the pain of man

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me?
Well
It's been a year
It doesn't surprise me
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I love you""
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]

A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My god I thought you were
Someone to rely on
Me?
I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

[Chorus x2]

See a mouse and I start to shake
I'm terrified of height
Scared of the dark
Gotta turn on a light

There's only one time
I can rise above
It's matter over mind
When it comes to love

I'm fearless, look at me
A portrait of bravery
A love kamikaze
I'm fearless, yeah baby, I'm fearless

I've got a purple heart
For every time it's been torn apart
Lord yes, I've been shot down
But I pick myself right up off the ground

I'm courageous, like Geronimo
Armed only with Cupid's arrow

Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy

My friends always tell me, I'm asking for too much 
Why can't I have the moon and stars, at my midas touch
I want electricity, and good 'ole fashioned passion in my life

And build my house on solid ground
But there's just one thing I will settle for

But you couldn`t see me
Too many lights out, but nowhere near here

It was me on that road
Still you couldn`t see me
And then flashlights and explosions

Roads ends getting nearer
We cover distance but not together
I am the storm and I am the wonder
And the flashlights, nigthmares
And sudden explosions

I don't know what more to ask for
I was given just one wish

It's about you and the sun
A morning run
The story of my maker
What have I and what I ache for

I`ve got a golden ear
I cut and I spear
And what else is there
Roads and getting nearer
We cover distance still not together

If I am the storm if I am the wonder
Will I have flashlights, nightmares
And sudden explosions

They would of tried some bullshit but a nigga had the blamer (try again)
They only got me cause they caught it on a camera (ow)
They wanna ball but they ain't got no stamina (they need it)
They said damn man you looking like Pac
I said nah, not alive, man I'm looking like Jones (cappo)
Besides I put money on your skull and bones
And keep it low watch what you say up on those fucking phones
Be quiet

And get ya ass hung the fuck up just like a bunch of clothes
Hey ma, we stretch work like you touch your toes
And in the middle of July we got that summer snow
I got em snowboarding in August
And I love a pretty bitch but the Porsche look gorgeous (you see it)

I guess the Hill is like the Swiss Alps, we bring them whips out

Looking at my ass know you wish he had a camera

Cool your old ass off cause it's hot on these streets (be easy)

Do you copy? capesh? (comprende?)
At this point I don't think they could take it
Sharks in the water they wont make it to safety (he drown)

And now the money taste sweet like pastry, they hate me (back at you)
Now tell me how I look
Would you rather live life like me or by the book? (you get it?)

They all know I put on for Harlem
Tell rich Broadway I took it up another level (God bless 'em)
I took 80, blew it on a Beezle
Bought the new Fiskar flew it through the ghetto (15th st)
The definition of opulence
The jewels dripping we dropping on top and popping shit (splash)
Who would think that this kid from the projects
Get his neck so cold you would think he's lethargic (I'm froze up)
The wrist look like hypothermia set in (what)
Pick a club night that the burner don't get in (I can't recall that)
We pop champagne until the club let out (and)
I drink and I fuck and then I piss a nigga rent out

Ich bin zuhause auf Beton und Asphalt
Da, wo die Großstadt nie schläft
Zuhause am Strand unter Palmen
Und dort, wo das Herz meiner Großmutter schlägt

Wechsel die Tapete, atmen für die Seele
Auf Dauer wird jeder Ort zum Käfig
Mehr als deine Sprache, mehr als deine Farbe
Ich pass nicht in die roten Linien deiner Karte

Erzähl von deiner zweiten Welt
Mit der dazugehörigen Portion Gefühle

Und flieg und tanz
Reisen ist wie neubetankt
Und schweb und fahr
Woanders wird der Kopf so klar
Kein Sinn und Zweck
Es zählt nur der Seiteneffekt
Mach dich einfach mal rar

Do you know what it feels like?
Do you know when the time's right
To go your very own way?
No matter what they say

I was never the one to do the things other people do
I'm the one to decide if what I do is cool

Never do I listen to what my parents try to tell me
A regular nine to five is not a part of my dream

(What, ah)
I always did my own things
And set my own kind of trends
I like buying new sneakers
An big baggy pants
I like going to the movies with a girl in my arm
I like boys that are cute
With a-lots of charm
I like going to a party, dance the night away
Sometimes I stay in bed
And I sleep all day
And if I don't like something,
I'll be quick to let you know
And this is how the story goes!

I'll always be curious
About a whole of stuff
And my mind always don't stop 
Until you get enough

If I see something that
I like, I go and grab it
And if I can't get it
On the same day

Hey, that'll be another
Just don't sweat it
You have to keep your head up
And go for your dreams,
Sometimes a little harder
Than what it may seem

And believe in yourself and go
For what you know,
Sometimes it's fast,
Sometimes it's slow
There are moments in your life
You wanna scream out loud,
And the others may wonder
What this is all about

It's just us six
Getting ready for the show
And this is how the story goes

Do you know what it feels like?
Do you know when the time's right
To go your very own way?

Not one of y'all can hate on me or can now, 
None of y'all can put no weight on me, you feel me
'Cause I'm out on own with it
And don't get mad 'cause I didn't need you to get it, hear me now
I hold it down each and everyday
And make sure I do my own thing my own way

Ain't nobody sleeping in your bed,what you're talking about?
I'm innocent,I didn't treat you bad girl,
What you're talking about? What? what?

Chorus:
Who's been sleeping in my bed?
Tell me boy,do you think I'm mad?
I've been wastin' so much time,thinking truly you were mine
Where have you been gone all night long?
Who's been calling there on the phone?
Why did you treat me so bad? Who's been sleeping in my bed?

Just another Sunday,hanging out in the city,
When I saw this lonely girl come in my way
She was looking so pretty,wearing Gucci and Fendi
It was not me who asked her if she wanted to stay with me

I know I might look guilty,the evidence is strong
I'm sure you're thinking that I'm filthy,but I didn't do you wrong
Now it's true that I was gone,but I wasn't all alone
I was hangin' with my homies when you called me on the phone
Yo,it might look strange that you found some lingerie
But believe me baby,baby,this can all be explained,ah
You konwa what,now this might sound a little rough
But maybe it's somebody trying to set me up

Who's been sleeping in my bed,huh? Yeah,come on tell me...

Chorus

Now what you mean who? Girl,what you're trying to do?
Just because you smell parfume don't mean someone was in the room
Not me,so why you're thinking that?
Girl,you know I keep it real and I always got your back
Now tell me why you're thinking that I would treat you that way?
I know you probably going off of what your girlies say
There ain't nobody in my bed in between the sheets,
Now you got it all wrong cause I Could never cheat

I know you did it!

Like a whole bunch of black folks, with no place to stay
Nowhere to lay, nowhere to pray
Just imagine, if you wore the same clothes thirty days
With scuffed up dirty J's, and plenty holes in your shirt
And won't nobody help you, they treat you like dirt
It's my life, I married the streets and made the hood my home
And I'ma represent this shit, till I'm gone
And even when I'm gone, you can listen to my songs
Cause I'ma let you know, what's right and what's wrong
It's wrong to borrow money, and never give it back
But if your family poor, it ain't wrong to sell crack
It's right to make cash, and make sure your click eat
And it's right to do a feature, with a nigga like me
Cause I'ma tell the truth, about everything I say
I've been through some shit, nigga I came a long way
From boy to man, from zero to grands
From no shows to mo' shows, and now I'm a man

See I be trying to spit some knowledge, to these kids
But should I tell 'em go to college, or quit and find a gig
Cause the world don't really give you jack, and if you black
Fucking round with that crack, get you some time on your back
That's why I always, try to keep it clean
The FED time got my brother, doing fifteen
At bed time, send my prayers up
And I stay prepared for the money in the air, I'm trying to have stuff
That's why, I'm all off in the rap game
And worldwide, trying to spread it 'cross the map mayn

Gotta survive regardless, any situation well

Thank God I'm still breathing, cause I'm a little heathen
I'm the type of cat, that start shit for no reason

And every single thing, he was saying came true

Hit licks flipping bricks, right after every class

Forever be pimping, 84 tipping all through the South 
Grilling boppers all through my tint, with diamonds all in my mouth 
They all in my mouth, looking stupid when I burn right past em 
Cause some of these broads be living shife, and setting up for the jacking 
But not today, cause Trae goin' be flipping on top of his game

as Joy Division’s ""closer"" spins
I slowly drift off in my head.
I swear I died 
a thousand times
to the ballad of those teenage nights.
The walls cave in,
and I’ve lost myself again.

Don’t sink, cause I know it’s tough.
Said you saw it comin’, weren’t prepared enough.
You wanna doubt you deserve to be loved,
but keep your head up, I swear that you belong.

Isolation,
it gets the best of me.
The world progresses 
while I’m chasing dreams.

I question everything
before I dive right in.
Am I a recluse
or just a damaged kid?

And even at 25, I find myself in silence.
My shaking voice is screaming out,
but I still prefer the quiet.
All my friends moved on
or gave up on themselves.
I can’t commit to anything
except the words escaping my mouth.

Isolation,
it gets the best of me.
The world progresses 
while I’m chasing dreams.

I question everything
before I dive right in.
Am I a recluse
or just a damaged kid?

We’re all just damaged kids.

Don’t sink, cause I know it’s tough.
Said you saw it comin, weren’t prepared enough.
You wanna doubt that you deserve to be loved,
but keep your head up I swear that you belong.

Isolation,
it gets the best of me.

but I’m stuck in these dreams.

I question everything
before I dive right in.
Am I a recluse

Broadside,"Working and working my life away,
with nothing to show but my bills are paid.
But inside you know
that you’re all alone.
What can you do
when the world moves on without you?

I chose a path
that wasn’t there before.
I’m not limiting myself
to just one single door.

But you’ll always be tied down,
Restricted by the pain that grips your life.
I felt it, 
so focused,
just barely scraping by.

Working and working my life away,
with nothing to show but my bills are paid.

Consume, repeat,
and force yourself to sleep.
Weak hands, sore feet, 
but it makes you feel complete.

The weight of the world’s got you
fallen to your knees.
So learn how to crawl before 
you stand on your feet.

You can’t believe
that you can feel complete.
While questioning to fill your tank
or maybe you should eat.
If somehow you can make it through,
working knuckles black and blue,
somehow finding time for you.
Some will win,
some may lose.

We are all drowning in an ocean of greed.
The rich will climb your shoulders
just to breathe.

Consume, repeat, 
and force yourself to sleep.
Weak hands, sore feet,
but it makes you feel complete.

The weight of the world’s got you
fallen to your knees.
So learn how to crawl before 
you stand on your feet.

I know you’re weak and tired,
you feel like givin in.
You question if it’s really worth it,
you’ve got to look inside.
You’ve got to realize
remember that the struggle’s worth it.

Inside you know that you’re all alone
but still you try.

And so you,
consume, repeat,

since I felt alive.
How can I believe
in this tired body of mine?
Chasing myself, into the night,
will it all matter when I close my eyes?

Have I won the race?
Embraced all my pain,
told my family enough,
that I value our name.
And if the weight of the world
pulls me from my feet,
drags me to the ground,
my chest trying to breathe,
I just wanna be known 
as the man who didn’t sink,
as the man who didn’t sink.",A Light in the Dark,2015
Broadside,"The wind is fucking up my hair,
been watching clouds go by for hours.
Standing on the weathered dock,
thinking of the times and what they cost me.
But was I ready
to turn my back and run
into the setting sun?

I don’t wanna grow old.
Sweet dreams,
I’ve been sold.
Opportunities passed me on my way back,
life’s moving too fast.
Different cities through the glass.
All my struggles are captured
in these photographs.

Faces in a crowded room
in my silence, I’m consumed.
They shake my hand and strike a pose
posting memories so I’ll know
that I was once known.
But when the moon is low,
why do I feel so damn alone?

I don’t wanna grow old.
Sweet dreams,
I’ve been sold.
Opportunities passed me on my way back,
life’s moving too fast.
Different cities through the glass.
All my struggles are captured
in these photographs.

I did what’s best for me
with some uncertainty. 
I climbed a mountain 
to embrace the things I couldn’t see.
Always been clear to me
just who I wanna be.
So far from chasin dreams,
cause greatness comes to 
those who never sleep.

I don’t wanna grow old.

Broadside,"I must have been a burden the first hours of my life,
the way dad pushed me and mom aside 
looking for a better life.
Most of my family
believes I’ll never be a star.
Since I was old enough to make a change,
I knew I’d make it far.

Cause not knowing who you are
keeps you wanting more.
Set fire to your heart,
be your own light in the dark.

I’m never looking back again,
and I’m never settling again.
I built these walls
to keep you out.
I’ll chase the sun into the ground,
but I’m never looking back again.

Progressing smoothly now,
slowly defeating my self-doubt.
Removed the dead weight of
of the people who only
look out for themselves.
And now that I have grown
enough to feel it in my bones.
I think about the choices made 
and all the winding roads.

I’m sick of always being asked,
“If this fails what comes next?”
Honestly, there’s nothing left.
This is all I have.

I’m never looking back again,
and I’m never settling again.
I built these walls
to keep you out.
I’ll chase the sun into the ground,
but I’m never looking back again.

Undetermined, failure, burdened by the womb.
Forced into this world by someone on the move.
See the stars,
chase the moon.
I can be anything,
but nothing like you.

The road is long,
I’m too far gone.
The burning sun is beating down,
still I’m never looking back again.

I’m never looking back again,

Trying hard to fit into 
a mold that wasn’t cast for you.
An image built with loneliness
and it’s just not working.
If fitting the part is what’s best for you,
you’re preaching things that were never true.
Your ego shows,
your friends may grow, 
but you’re still a clone.

You were always searching for the fast lane,
you sell yourself short, it’s the easy way.
Ducking every mirror just to hide your shame.

we had our lives
and they had theirs. 
You bought in quick
and sold out fast,
so enjoy the crash.

I’m not bitter on the friends that I’ve lost,
just a little confused
by the time it cost.
For you to show your face,
what a disgusting waste.
But are you happy now?

You say that I’m too harsh on you 
and how you spend your time.
That your old life’s gone,

ducking bottles most of my life.
Drug lords were neighbors,
dodging those blue lights.

She worked the night shift
Dishwater blonde, tall and fine
She got a lot of tips
Well, earlier I'd been talkin' stuff
In a violent room
Fighting with lovers past
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine
Dorothy was fast
Well, I ordered, ""Yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, I ain't to hungry""
Dorothy laughed
She said ""Sounds like a real man to me""
Kinda cute, you want to take a bath?
(do you want to, do you want to, bath)
I said ""Cool, but I'm leaving my pants on"" (she say)
""'cause I'm kind of going with someone""
She said ""Sounds like a real man to me""
""Mind if I turn on the radio?""
""Oh, my favorite song"" she said
And it was Joni singing ""Help me I think I'm falling""

The phone rang and she said
""Whoever's calling can't be as cute as you""
Right then I knew I was through
(Dorothy Parker was cool)
My pants where wet, they came off
But she didn't see the movie
Cause she hadn't read the book first
Instead she pretended she was blind
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse
Dorothy made me laugh (ha ha)
I felt much better so I went back 
To the violent room (tell us what you did)
Let me tell you what I did

I took another bubble bath with my pants on
All the fighting stopped

What I feel for you is real love
In other's eyes I see reflected a hurt, scorned, rejected
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, born  in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, take a look at me

I started my life in an old, cold, rundown tenement slum
My father left, he never even married Mom
I shared the guilt my mama knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name

This love we're contemplating, is worth the pain of waiting
We'll only end up hating the child we may be creating
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, by society
Love child, always second best
Love child, diff'rent from the rest
Hold on, whoa

I started school in a worn, torn, dress that somebody threw out
I knew the way it was to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends could see the guilt in me
Don't think that I don't need you
Don't think I don't want to please you
No child of mine'll be bearing the name of shame I've been wearin'

Love child, never quite as good
Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood
But I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you

Deep and crisp and even.

Gathering winter fuel.

Hither, page, and stand by me.
If thou know it telling:
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain,
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.
Bring me pine logs hither.
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear the thither.
Page and monarch, forth they went,
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.

Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind blows stronger.
Fails my heart, I know not how.
I can go no longer.
Ark my footsteps my good page,
Tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's step he trod,
Where the snow lay dented.

Which the saint had printed.

It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home 
And pity the miner digging my bones

Barely got control of it, must've got a hold of it
Threw me to the ground and left a scar right on my nigga lips
I look in my closet when I think about the past life
Never good in my wallet, tryna see if I got my cash right
Fuck a flight, they ain't never wanna treat my bag right
Fuck a job, they ain't never treat my mom and dad right

I hate them quiet suburbs, I hate those picket fences
I hate the separation, first thing they called me ""nigga""
I fight, I got suspended, my teachers saw me hit him
So they ain't listen to me, and from that moment on
I would learn that I was different, I would grow to see the difference
Second guessing my decisions, black bodies come up missing

I would walk through the halls at my own pace
Every lunch, I would flow, having no place
All the books in my bag 'til my bones ache
Wonder how the world would be if I had no face
If I had no heart, if I had no skin
And I was just thoughts, reminiscing
The things always brushed off
Had my father try to tell me I was just soft
And when I look at the things that I've been through
And the things I survived and at what cost?
All the love in my life that I just lost
All this shit persevere to the pole vault

In the eyes of the blogs, I'm a paycheck
In the eyes of the world, I'm an icon

On the way to see this girl
Take a flight back just to keep my job
Used to fly standby, late to the airport
Where the buddy pass? Stuck in the traffic
Whole lotta hours, real long distance
But I've grown since then
Learned to be on my own since then
Marble floor in my brand new crib
This the life that I wanted still
Got a hole and it burn my chest
Mash the chip that's still in my shoulder
Ain't a day that I still been sober
These the things that I'm tripping over (Y'all motherfuckers made 3 albums)

Still talking about the same shit
The one gay, the one selling drugs
The one that's tryna act like Lil Wayne
What the fuck is this shit man?
Y'all better turn this shit off when y'all get in the whip
When y'all enter my whip y'all better not play this shit
'Cause this can go right the fuck off

Now them boys hooked on heroin
Parents always asking like, ""Where y'all get it from?""

Single out the reasons how I quit before I fell down
I used to pick Ameer up, talk about what's got us fucked up
We vent 'til the sun up (ay), hopefully get our funds up (ay)
And if I didn't know y'all maybe y'all would have a desk job
Ticking 'till I off myself
Used to drive around for some hours (oh, ohhh)
Used to get paid by the hour (oh, ohhh)
Now I'm just pickin up a check (oh, ohhh)

I spent like a year and a half feeling sorry for myself
'Cause I thought love ain't make sense anymore
If I drank, you would probably see a fifth on the floor
And a hole in the door, rest a few more
Scared of the past I’ve been tryna avoid from before I was born 
Running from the shoes that my grandfathers wore
Tryna pick a better battle, but I saw I'd win the war
Feel the sun in my pores but I still got clouds in my head, now
Rain for a little bit, stay for a little bit
Moved along with my head, down
That's what momma taught me and I never let them fuck me
When they handed me a dead king's crown
Told 'em think of what you doing before I'm the one you're choosing
I just wanna be a human when I share myself
Hear the things I'm saying and I scare myself, goddamn

Throw my dress shoes in a fire with the woods

With your friends""

Pack it up like a clown car

I speak in tongues, and I arrive without a damn mention
It's kinda sick and I was born in 1996 and
1999 the only year that I remember
I slip through the cracks without havin' a damn temper
I bleach my hair because these bitches all about they bitchin'
I say shit when I rap and y'all niggas barely listen
I do the most for the culture, nigga, by just existing
Delete my tweets 'cause I'm ashamed of being a fuckin' Simpson
I told my mom I was gay, why the fuck she ain't listen?
I signed a pub deal and her opinion fuckin' disappearin'
I'm payin' bills for my sister and tryna fund her business
Is it homophobic to only hook up with straight niggas?
You know, like closet niggas, masc-type
Why don't you take that mask off? That's the thought I had last night
Why you always rap about bein' gay?
'Cause not enough niggas rappin' be gay

Where I come from niggas get called ""faggot"" and killed
So I'ma get head from a nigga right here
And they can come and cut my hand off and
And my legs off and
And I'ma still be a boss 'til my head go, yeah

I just bought me a fifth and now I'm speedin', swervin'
I took an eighth of them shrooms and now I'm hearin' voices
I took like two of them pills, I can't remember nothing
I ain't under control, I'm losin' motor function
I need an intervention, I need an exorcism
I need a therapist, paranoia and drug addiction
It's very scary, my momma don't even recognise me
I'm goin' crazy, don't need nobody to say they love me
My acts of desperation, I'm on an empty stomach
So fuck the consequences, I ain't runnin' from them

Feelin' like a goner
Put my life in locker
Hotbox in the Hummer
Hotbox in the summer
If I had the option, I would do it all again
If I had the option, I would do it all again
I just wanna feel like I did the right program
I just want to appeal to my dad and my cousins (again)
When I cut that feel I do nothing but diplomas
Love is going, bet you didn't do it by your lonesome
So I forgive my mommy, daddy, auntie and my uncles
For guilt-tripping feelings whenever they call my number
They see men dream, they see men fallin'
But when I dream, I'm smashing on a llama

Both pessimistic, drug addicted, caught in our feelings
We spit venom then stare at the ceiling wondering why
My mom's no alcoholic, she just wanna drown her sorrows
Love her to death and soon enough I'll give back all I borrowed
Both so submissive, take turns dominating, the light has been faded
This hate-fueled love, we don't fake it, no giving, just taking

I took some steps to be a bigger person
I should've thrown ya off the highway to cause swerving
Ain't no burden, ain't no sermon, ain't no motherfuckin' plaque
I hate these hospitals and police and the smell of death, all that
I hate these shady folk that want a ladylike
But don't treat lady right, but they be sayin' like ""just the tip""
And, yeah, you mad 'cause she ain't fuck, mad 'cause she ain't suck
Beat your ass before you got time to say ""why not?""
Here to catch ya slip up, wish you could just rewind
Time to not fuck up, thought you were just lucked up
Where the respect? Is your ass human?
I look you in your eyes, say ""fuck you, are you fuckin' stupid?""
Respect my mother, 'spect my sister, 'spect these women, boy
I get my 99, I don't own one, hit the store to blow your brains off
Better hope my aim off
Better hope the range off
Better hope my tame off
Before I blow your brains off, boy

No hands with the stunts
Jump off the roof like I do what I want
All of the life in my past wanna haunt
And my sight of the future beginning to taunt my ambition

Tell them niggas come and find me

New house off iTunes
New money, my perfume
Big smile, in a good mood
I been running outta issues
I ain't trippin' when the rent due
I ain't runnin' with a pistol
I ain't locked in the system
Taking care of my kin folk

Taking a book out the page of the graves
I'm only human and I make mistakes
Chisel my flows so they can't liberate
Talkin' the time as the pendulum sways
I gotta face what I didn't create
Just cause I can't relate
I don't debate
I educate
Illuminate or we can't duplicate
No more moving the plates
Second chances feeling overrated, unappreciated
So I bossed up
Missed the time when we could share space

Lose myself inside of you

I could barely laugh, I could barely hang
And there's a male stripper doing a belly dance for me
And my boyfriend still the same
And I'm drunk as fuck, nigga sucks up
For a reason to get my bucks up, and the reason I care about society
Is a good enough reason just to hire me
But honestly, see my mom can't walk and her lungs don't work like they used to
And I feel like it's my fault 'cause of music
I be saying shit just to fucking ruined it, I'm truant
But truthfully, the words had damage and it's fooling me
But even more cruel to be, this is here for you niggas that paid to hear me

Sometimes I be wondering, why I been tripping off
And I should probably spend my time writing rhymes in the dentist's office
That's killing two birds with one stone
When I was younger, way before I was grown, I wanted a deal with Death Row
Or Rhymesayers, I'm saving my time for mics later
I might save it, depending on the shit that y'all write later
I hate writers, I hate tweets, I hate journalists
They hate truth, they hate peace, they want my niggas to burn

Flicking on the face of my wrist watch
Watch the time stop just to speak up, watch life unfold
And between the tick-tocks speeding down the one way

When it feel right, I'm fine
No, I'm not lyin', don't ask me
I'll pay the fine, I'll pay the toll, just hope I don't crash it
But hey, if I do, it will be a blaze of glory
Engulfed by the manifestation of death behind me
All my life I've felt inadequate
And through the years I've dealt with tragedy after tragedy
God, send a message
Send a messenger my way
Never claimed to be a saint, forgive me
Feel like the light that I was blessed with has diminished
I'm haunted, by the visions of my youth turned true
I've come to expect my expectations aren't true
But I'm a master of believing my lies
And you can't break me, and I can break at the speed of light

I'm afraid to share the bed, what if she want money later
She got laid off, uh, hit my lawyer for some paper
I'm afraid to speak my pains like you're lucky where you at
You cool but quit complaining 'bout all dat
That's why I'm showing up late
I'm not tryna be a dick, but my time is not to waste
For myself, for the small talk with my sensei
Where my sense at?
Four-cylinder go round
Lincoln Tahoe pick me up
Drop me off, I got bubble under my biceps, meet me into the sidestep
Ego is getting sized up, I be on butterfly effect
Fuck it, I'll be myself now, tell 'em I take no shit now
Tell 'em they work for me now, tell 'em my tears, they bleed down
Tell 'em I work like what, what time for me now
Wondering who is me now, wondering where you been now
Lose you in crowds, I see you now
Fourteen, I see 'em all inside of me now
Bank account with less fees now
Make it from ways to feed now, thinking of ways to be everything
But right now

It's crazy how things that are best reminisce when we check ourselves
It's crazy people who left started feeling left out when we set for health
Still accustomed to nights filled with solitude
I don't always remember call goodnight
I don't always remember my altitude
I don't always remember to stop the fight
But I might check my sight
It ain't right, yeah, I know

I deleted Facebook, I'll trade fame any day
For a quiet Texas place and a barbecue plate
I'll switch my place if that's good for you, is that good for you?
My ghost still haunt you, my life is I, Tonya

My shelter sheltered me from things I needed to commit to

I know accounts should be deleted, I know some niggas should stop hitting my phone

It doesn't matter what we do
Just as long as I'm with you
I'd do the same thing every day.

I've never felt like this before
You keep me coming back for more
And I hope you feel the same.

When I'm with you [x10]

Surrender, and let the beat control your body
You're changed. Can't help it. Hone your edge

Invincible. So seductive, that wildness.
And let the beat control your body
Get involved. Don't chase, allow this movement

Get involved. Don't chase, allow this movement
And let the beat control your body

And let the beat control  your body

Uncontrollable, inconsolable, electric, primitive
Uninvited. So excited. Savage prerogative.
Ferocious. Precocious. Raw power, ecstasy.
Liberate, don't hesitate
And let the beat control your body.

Yet these memories remain, stuck in my bones and my brain

I wonder will we be
Up to the legend once we heard
I wonder if we will see
Each other flying as two halcyon birds",Halcyon Birds [Radio Edit] [Edit],2016

To the western wonders
Burning all desires, tell me
Should we go somewhere high together now

Stuck in this fake place
Just looking out the window
He turned the blind eye
To see how far he can go
Tell me my love why
Should we forget what we know
Forget how it was
When we were young years ago

I don't know where I
Could go forever with you
Take you somewhere high
A secret place just for two
We should live there now
This is our chance to break through
No more hateful lies

Broken Bells,"We're bound to wait all night.
She's bound to run amok.
Invested enough in it anyhow,

That's all we hoped it was. 
A break from the warfare in your house,

Broken Bells,"Tonight I send a word
The wind is blowing all over
There's blood on the knife
Who'd have known
You're a devious sister
Guts on your blouse
Going the wrong way

And diamonds, a dozen
Sailing to nowhere
Vapor to float on
Still we hold on to the night

Behind I see stars, draining the light
Looking down by your house
One by one
Lord, to find
Our way out
Falling with the ghost
Down

Running in circles
A mouse on the table
I try to feel
But just don't
Hurting and dead inside
Down and covered in ah
Sit down",Sailing to Nowhere,2010
Broken Bells,"This is a day without
A trace of reason
No matter where you turn

And the walls will fall
Affirming nothing
So what's it all about?

Call on a bright star
Or play your hand as an intellect
Wounds always speak too loud

Get along for awhile
See the sin in the sea
How the innocent are bound to the damned
What is, just is, I know
So we're trapped by answers
Love haunts to the end

Are we all to ride
The edge of nothing?
Shake hands if I deny

And if they don't know
Their heart is stopping
Cause everyone is right

Get along for awhile
See the sin in the sea
How the innocent are bound to the damned
What is, just is, I know
So we're trapped by answers
Love haunts to the end

From the moment that we're born
Till we're old and tired out
Do we ever know?

From the moment that were born
Till we're old and tired out
Do we ever know?",Citizen,2010
Broken Bells,"She sold her love to a modern man
Cause solid currency's the hardest to love
All other modern hells you cover your eye
Don't let the lady finger blow in your hat
Di-di-da

Feel like a daughter
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up
The ghost inside

This gives some matter to shaking her hide
Too late to leave him' are the songs in her car
Di-di-da

Feel like a daughter
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up
The ghost inside

They call it chivalry
Never pull a punch for free
You ever wonder why they had to move on
This phony article
That put you on the floor
A double standard
You envoke when you want

Feel like a daughter
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up
The ghost inside

Was it all for show?
To turn into all of them
Turning a page
Trust me darlin'
I'm carving 'em up through the dust in your town
Crawling over rubble, just to sound me out
Tend to wonder why?",The Ghost Inside,2010

Broken Bells,"Use your intuition
It's all you've got
Keys are revving
There's a dozen locks
Standing your way
So goes the gold age
To your entire life

Digging for a way
You cast a spell
Grab a path from all the things they sell
But they don't let go
Just touch your shin bone
Keep them away

I know what I know
But nothing will fill the hole
So let your mind go (let my mind go)
Straight down the runway
Does one want to
Get more used to?
The mall and misery (the mall and the misery)
The dead mouths it costs to be alive

Oh she lies half burning
From the batting crows
You're falling like a lamb
What you've never been told
There's a new world
Somewhere a good girl
Lives and breathes

Part of her opened the callow mind
Audio has stolen the morning tide
There's a dark time
This is a dark life
Feel your heart

I know what I know
But nothing will fill the hole
So let your mind go (let my mind go)
Straight down the runway

Broken Bells,"Is it hard to wait?
Drawn by your mongrel heart again
If they don't answer, would you want to be found out?
You duck through the wind in your old blight on the town

Love is turning you out
Sliding worry round
I try to warn its waiting game
To bring that specter down

Would it be wrong
To clamp down on your racing heart? Love
And if they'd known, what sifted down to be found out?
It's not what you deserve

Love is turning you out
Sliding worry round
I try to warn its waiting game
To bring that specter down

Faster than you were going to allow
Turn out the lights or say get out
If you don't answer, would you want to be found, love?
Five days on, trapped by a wave

Love is turning you out
Sliding worry round
I try to warn this waiting game
To bring that specter down

Black corn was soaking
You'll be cut down in the seedy stairway
If you don't answer, would you want to be found now?
Sapped from the bed to the window

Looking back on that time
Starting in the minds
What it is to be twenty nine
Fame sets your life down

Would it be wrong
Would it be wrong
To disappoint you now
Disappoint you now",Mongrel Heart,2010
Broken Bells,"So you showed me around your town
To hell again and back
Our love has served to alienate
All the friends you depend on
I know it might seem odd

I know it might seem odd
Cause your not the only one
I remember my self as a lonely child
So I was
And you've got me wrong
You've got me wrong

(Ground your sense of worth
Til the spark of morning burns
And all those searching eyes
Could scold your tender mind)

Remember what they say
There's no shortcut to a dream
It's all blood and sweat
And life is what you manage in between

But what you don't know
Is you're too young and eager to love
Seething eyes
So you're about to get into
The ditch that you opened up

(Ground your sense of worth
Til the spark of morning burns
And all those searching eyes
Could scold your tender mind)

So the stars aligned
And leave you behind
You wanna sow it up
Here come the light
Of an autumn moon
Sister you know enough
But for now just let it go
Don't run, don't rush
Just flow

Through the give and take you had to learn
How to cross the coals and not get burned
But you're really just a little girl
Playing in the park until the sun goes down

Sometime you want to rise
One did it's our desire
No doubt you think you braided your own hair
So you're all grown up

Should you want to cross the line
Which way do you want to fly?
Pretend that love could help you find your way
But you got me wrong
Yeah you got me wrong",October,2010
