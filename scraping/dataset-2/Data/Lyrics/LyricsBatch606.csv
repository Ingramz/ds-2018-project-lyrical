Lisa Maffia,"Oh 
I can't hide hide no more, the way I feel about you,
It's been going on too long.
Gonna play my cards upon the table,
Can't hold back this Love for so long, I can't carry on.

Can't explain how I feel,
It's a feeling so real
It's just the things that you do,
That got me so in love with you.
Can't explain how I feel,
It's a feeling so real
Its just the things that you do,
That got me so in love with you.

There's been, times I think I'm goin' crazy
Can't go on when your not around
And I no that I will always love you baby
This is fate I feel it inside finding you was right.
Touching, kisses, when we are together, you've been holding me all night,
I hear, no fear, of me leaving baby, and I promise your love will always be my special love.

Thinking bout the first time I meet you,I felt so in love with you,
Wondering will you be the one in my life,
'cause I'm needing you.

Lisa Manning,"You make me feel so young
You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

The moment that you speak 
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are songs to be sung Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today

Do you really think so?
True perfection
But can I really do it?
Take it to the ball and on that runway
Walk the body
And remember, shoot that arrow!
No matter what I do, no matter what I say
My t-shirt's changed since yesterday
I look into the mirror and my t-shirt's got a mark
I guess it's just because my life is falling apart
But I felt something hurting
And a boy said,
There's somethin jumpin!
Jumpin in my shirt
Something's jumpin, jumpin in your shirt
Something's jumpin, does it really hurt?
Something's jumpin, my hearts on red alert
Walk the body! Walk the body!

Lisa Marie Presley,"Dreams of contemplation, 
A resignation, know what 
Useless indignation, 
A segregation, plant your seed 
Steamless conversation, 
What is happening to me 
I'm no longer your erection, 
Or your congregation, 
I'm your disease 

You take the sun 
You have your fun 
But you better beware 
You better beware 
You broke it down 
With that boring sound 
You gave to me 
That I don't want to hear 

You're in some blind elation, 
A kind of delusion, 
You don't get through to me 
Deliver your equation and still 
You won't see a change in me 
You want my redemption, 
You want me to believe 
That it's all me 
Well, I'm no longer your erection, 
Or your congregation, 
I'm your disease 

You take the sun 
You have your fun 
But you better beware

You broke it down

Lisa Marie Presley,"Well, what do we have here Daddy 
The lights are quickly changing 
Will I leave your heart along with 
The phone lines you're erasing 
A spineless ending 
Well, who would have guessed dear daddy 
Turned out to be a coward 
When I turned my back you cut my throat 
It bled for hours 
Was that your power 

You, you're the lovely victim again 
You, well your heart is breaking 
You are the only one let down 
Are you really now 

Well, soon here we'll have dear Daddy 
With the next one on her knees 
And she's gonna call him daddy 
Like the rest of them, like me 
How easy it will be Replacing me 
And what's that I hear now Daddy 
You're blaming it all on me 
Another she did you wrong 
And of course you had to leave 
And the yes men will agree
You gave it everything 

You with the advisors in your ear 
You did everything right it's clear 
I know I begged you to stay around 
But I'm gone now 

Well, here's to you my darling leave 
You're stubborn and you're free 
And of course, right 
I don't respect the way you leave 
You can be no friend to me 
I'll say goodbye 

You, you're the lovely victim again 
You, well your heart is breaking 
You are the only one let down 
Are you really now

But I'm gone now",Gone,2003
Lisa Marie Presley,"Maybe if I liked being alone
I could give you your life back and let you go
Maybe if I got it together again
I wouldn't be belligerent and such a princess
Maybe the reason I got needy is because I never had real devotion
Maybe I criticized your loyalty because it wasn't given to me

Do you know who I am
It's me in here with the doctor and the crowd around me
They are my chosen family
Tell me I'm important
But what about them standing there they don't get it
They're smiling at me, I guess they're used to this

Maybe I'll stop wondering when I'm gonna die
Maybe then I'll stop holding so hard to my life
Maybe next time I see my reflection my mind won't be with me
Maybe my brutal honesty is only because I can get away with it
Maybe I'll squash you relentlessly because you tried to crush me

Do you know who I am
It's me in here with the doctor and the crowd around me
They are my chosen family
I guess you're not important
But what about you standing there you can't get in
You're smiling at me, I guess you're used to this

Please get out of my way I don't like fucking waiting
You need to bring me my food first
I'm not the one you want to starve
And maybe you think you're my friend
And maybe one day you'll give a shit about what I am

We won't make it, my friend 
And it looks like 
You can't take it again, my friend 
And all the pretty roses wilted up 
And paled themselves away today 
The guillotine of truth has fallen, 
Somehow I'm the one you blame 

This can't be happening 
Not so fast, I'm so mean 
I can't stay indifferent 
Because I know the outcome 

And I'm the target for the daggers 
That the truth's thrown your way, today 
And the next one 
Maybe she'll be easier 
She'll make it go away, hey 
She's still calling you 
I'm still calling him

Lisa Marie Presley,"You were a million miles behind
And I was crying every time I'd leave you
Then I didn't want to see you
I still keep my watch two hours behind

Someone turned the lights out there in Memphis
That's where my family's buried and gone
Last time I was there I noticed a space left
Next to them there in Memphis
In the damn back lawn

I didn't know that I was in the crowd
And the fresh cut grass stopped growing
Everything on my shelf has fallen
I still keep my watch two hours behind

Someone turned the lights out there in Memphis
That's where my family's buried and gone
Last time I was there I noticed a space left
Next to them there in Memphis

Was that bridge I was crossing somewhere I stopped walking
I guess I fell off on my own
I heard all the roads they lead to Memphis
Except for the one I'm stumbling down
And I'll be damned if I ever get this

And I haven't forgotten.",Lights Out,2003
Lisa Marie Presley,"I heard broken footsteps
Was that you limping
Well, I wish that I had spent
Just a little bit more time with you

Tears on my ceiling
Weren't you watching
Well, I guess none of us
Will ever know what comes after this

You're still lovely
You were lovely then
All that you had to endure
I guess nobody noticed it

I know your resemblance
It's out there walking
And I wanted you to know
That I haven't forgotten

Well, they tried to make
You look broken
But not while I'm living
'Cause I wanted you to know that
I heard what you said
While it was raining

Did you know nothing has changed
And now everyone they notice it

I caught a glimpse of my reflection in you
But they can't believe I still want you around

I can't believe you said I hurt you again
But I can't afford to let you get away
And I cannot take the darkness when you stay
You're all I see
And It's definitely my fault
You're all I see
But don't come near me at all
How many roads between your world and mine
How many broken doors and how many fights

Cause I needed to be

Near the fireflies flying high above me
Then I hit the sky and it fell down on me

You said it wasn't sharp but I cut my finger
You said it just wouldn't burn and I scarred my face

You know I bite my nails my skin and my fingers
And I've heard that's my liver my nerves and my brain
I said I just like to bite on my fuckin fingers
Do you have another intelligent answer for me today

You said it wasn't sharp but I cut my finger
You said it just wouldn't burn and I scarred my face
You said it just wasn't ? when it fell down on me

You were dangerous and scary
And you poisoned me with the fruits everyone was intrigued by
And I finally got buried

Was it that I never had your back? 
Was it that I was always trying to save you

They always trust you but they're dying out.

It blows my mind.

It's gonna make you sit still and listen. 

I'm sorry, children, you don't have the choice. 
Your parents gave you something way back when. 
There's nothing wrong with you; 
It's easier to give you this. 
Then you won't embarrass them. 
When there's something wrong, take an antidepressant. You can even choose which kind you want by the latest suicide.

Lisa Miskovsky,"4 days on the floor, 
I've seen this place before
The sign is on the door, I need you
The light shades down the fence, 
I leave my time and sense
'Cause I don't even fall through your open door

Why won't you help me to understand?
Why I can't keep my faith in Love?
Why won't you lend me a helping hand?
I think I need a push in the shove
Help me to understand, why I need you so bad?

Sunshine can be cruel, 
You try to keep your cool
But all I ever said, ""I need you""
Oh, loose all I can't hold 
And lately I've been so cold
And I won't even fall through that open door

Why won't you help me to understand?
Why I can't keep my faith in Love?
Why won't you lend me a helping hand?

Lady Stardust spread your hair a
Cross your universe of magic, 
Let us in.

Let's fly into the milky-way, 
Climb these concrete walls 
And say don't ever close us in.

Like every city needs a distance, 
Every sky demands a moon,
Every winter needs a snowfall,
Every summer wants a June.
Money is just a piece of paper,
Gold is blinding, don't you see.

Fame is just our own illusion, 
Of what life is meant to be.
But I don't need a perfect mirror, 
I don't care for queens and kings.
We are free and we are perfect,

Play on

Oh, Lady Stardust sing. Play on
Lady Stardust sing

Stardust, 
Lady Stardust let us cruise 
Around your universe of magic, I'm in.

Let's play this song, on and on, 
Until the dawn and never let them win.
And every minute needs the hour, 
Every day demands a night, 
Every giant supernova hits the city with your light.

Movie-stars and grand directors, 
Silver screens and MTV's, 
Gods and angels all around me 
Fills the air like little bees.

I don't need no superheroes, 
I don't care for gods with wings, 
I hear teardrops on the pavement 
When Lady Stardust sings. 
Play on.

Lady Stardust sing, play on.

And I don't need no superheroes, 
I don't care for gods with wings,

Na, na, na, na, na, now she sings
Na, na, na, na, na, now she sings
Na, na, na, na, I'll sing for you.

I'll sing this song, so please hold on,
I'll sing this song for you

You paint the world in black and blue

Leave me in the midnight sun

You left me in the line of fire
You said that love's the biggest liar
I saw silver in the sky today
Leave me, you still have time to run

I saw shadows leaving vapor trails
Leave me in the midnight sun

Lisa Miskovsky,"When I came there, I was dressed in blues
Watched her dancing, without no shoes
I couldn't help it but I was feeling down
Wanted her to disappear when I led her down

She's your angel, she's your altitude
And I'm a broken, lady
And I act way too, way too rude

In another life, oh, what a strange excuse
I'm left here all alone, well, well, well, well, I'm still having fun
When nothing matters, something changes inside
My eyes cried a thousand tears, my arms were open wide

'Cause you don't love me
Oh how I wanted you
It's always that extra hand
That will pull you, will pull you through

Lisa Miskovsky,"Caught your eyes across the cantina floor
Hiding my smile when you passed through the door
We were young, only seventeen
Driving around in your daddy's dream

And I was your angel, 
Oh baby, you were my king
And we had coins in our pockets, 
And we had songs to sing
And I had my mom's dress, 
No wedding ring
We walked down at the valley 
But I couldn't hear your restless heart

You're always working, 
Always running late
So, I eat my dinner 
And watch the show that you hate
Oh, how can you spark, 
When I burn so bright
And how can I breathe 
When you will not fight

I believe it was the night

?Cause I feel so lost when you're mine
You can no longer give you that sign
?Cause you dance just like me, yeah
Just like me

I can't see ?cause I'm blinded with the ocean
That you once gave to me
Why can't I be alone, I get a notion
That it wasn't meant to be

But it?s easy to see when you're blind
You can hear me when I make that sound
?Cause you dance just like me, yeah
Just like me

You can see with no eyes
You can feel the wind blow
Through the streets with no lights

When you need someone there through the night
I can guide you through fire and ice

From courthouse tower to griffin mill
Small signs of winter come creeping down the hills

I saw your shadow on Jackson St.
Where the zombie-eyed kids 
And the speed-queens meet
It's been a long time running 
Through my veins this long lost dream

And I tear it apart 
And burn it all down 'cause I have to

All the enemies made in the process

We're just carrying different crosses
I'm feeling no pain baby, 
It's acceptable losses

The store-fronts blown I guess nothing lasts
The fighting at the bars 
Still draw wired vengeful crowds

As the shadows grow tall and the stars come out
Were the backseat lovers used to park their daddy's car

And I tear it apart 
And burn it all down 'cause I have to
Made a deal with a man at the crossroads

Our pain feels the same 
We're just carrying different crosses

Where the Johnson twins became newsflash kids

Don't believe you'd call it quits

Now I got an old address and I'm waiting there
In the first light of morning at the fire stairs
I can hear someone's something and suddenly I'm scared

And I ran for my life 'cause I had to
My heart won't stop bleeding

I've been waiting for so long
This is last year's song

It all began in this prayed up town 
(You were looking for a way out, 
Love strapped you down)
I turned and ran as we were taking our vows
It sure is hard to run in a wedding gown

So I stole your car, 
And ran it through your heart
And the radio was on, 
Playing last year's song
And if you're listening now, 
Can I get through somehow

Lisa Mitchell,"Like a turning head, like a second look
Like a burning leaf of an open book.
Like a pounding sea, like a massive climb,
When your eyes first met with mine.

Like a broken word, like a tragic smile
Like a thousand steps or a single mile.
Like a lonely chance, like a sacage glow,
When you turned and said hello.

I was just about to go.
There were flowers on the ceiling.
You left me feeling,

Like a fading voice, like a closing door,
Like a dozen lies and a dozen more.
Like a twisted tongue, like a distant bark,
When we broke out into the dark.

Stars looked like burning sparks.
The lights were on but chilling.
You left me feeling,

Tired, I could not close my eyes.
On fire, but frozen inside.
To run or to hide.

Speechless, my words would not melt.
Whispered, I wanted to shout.
Without you I felt,

Like a fleeting thought, like a double life,
Like a gentle feel of a warming taste.
Like a plassive breath, like a cooling blow,
When you stopped and held me close.

Inside I nearly froze.
Your touch is almost healing,
You left me feeling,

Tired, I could not close my eyes.
On fire, but frozen inside.
To run or to hide.

Speechless, my words would not melt.
Whispered, I wanted to shout.
Without you I felt,

Like a setting sun, like a lost goodbye.
Like an incomplete lullaby.

alla hot som aldrig når dig.
jag ska sjunga dig ett löfte,
och jag vet att du förstår mig.

Fem fingrar ska skydda dig.
Ett är månen, ett är solen, ett är polstjärnan bakom molnen.
Ett är hopp och ett är tro.
Handens fem fingrar vaggar dig till ro.

Om du tänker dig den skogsväg,
vi vandrar ibland,
gick vi stigen ner till vattnet.
Din hand är i min hand.
Se så långt där ner i djupet,
på botten av den sjön,
där finns en silverskatt som glimmar,
den är din inatt.
Så slumra in och dröm.

Fem fingrar ska skydda dig.
Ett är månen, ett är solen, ett är polstjärnan bakom molnen.
Ett är hopp och ett är tro.
Handens fem fingrar vaggar dig till ro.

Lisa O'Kane,"When Daddy told me what happened 
I couldn't believe what he just said
Sonny shot himself with a 44 
And they found him lyin' on his bed
I could not speak a single word 
No tears streamed down my face
I just sat there on the living room couch 
Starin' off into space
Mama and Daddy went over to the house 
To see what had to be done
They took the sheets off of the bed 
And they went to call someone
Some of us gathered at a friend's house 
To help each other ease the pain
I just sat alone in a corner chair 
I couldn't say much of anything
We drove on out to the country
His friends all stood around
Subiaco Cemetery 
Is where we lay him down
I saw his mama, she was standin' there 
His sister, she was there too
I saw them look at us standin' around the grave 
And not a soul they knew
Born and raised in Pineola 
His mama believed in the Pentecost
She got the preacher to say some words 
So his soul wouldn't be lost
Some of us, we stood in silence 
Some bowed their heads and prayed
I think I must've picked up a handful of dust 
And let it fall over his grave
I think I must've picked up a handful of dust 
And let it fall over his grave",Pineola,2001

And in the abundance of this love there is more than enough 
In our hearts we feel inspired for love to shine through
When hope makes a wish every wish comes true

A prayer to unite us in our hearts in a joy that’s Divine
When we’re given grace it’s for everyone to receive
When hope makes a wish we can all believe 

Do we stand in awe like a child reaching for God’s hand
Do we search our thoughts in wonder of the wisdom of God's plan 
Now we can start to open our hearts to the mystery that only God understands 
How else can we cope          
God has given us Hope    

When love has a dream it helps us to see 
A vision of everything we are and of what we can be

When they flow right through you

Would you love me if I fell on hard times?
Lost everything, down to a dime?
Would you, let me fuck if I didn't stack cheese?
Didn't see my face on BET?

Would you, stop for me, if I wasn't on dubs?
Didn't buy the bar when I walk through the club?
Would you, let me slide if I wasn't so live?
Average joe working nine to five?

Would you still want to ride? 
Still want to freak if the ice wasn't bright in the masterpiece?
If you didn't lose sight when I flashed the three
Would you still be shakin that ass for me?

Would you, creek, let me run in it?
Kiss the first night, take it to the limit?
If I had to go to jail would you hold it down?
If not, shit I'ma leave ya now, I need to know

[Chorus: Mario Winans w/ ad libs]
I gotta know, baby
Would you be right here beside me when I'm gone
Still have my back without promise to have it all
Baby this is what I'm fighting for 
Oh tell me 'cause I gotta know

Don diva, first name Lisa
Raye, freshly dipped in Burberr-ay
My team is green with red cherr-ay

If I was broke would you still want to marry?
If I wasn't on the screen, would you still fiend?
And would I still be your dream? 
If I didn't gleam on my own 

Would you still be in that zone?
Would you never leave me alone?
If I was a Reebok hood rat would you still book that flight 
Outta town, if I didn't stay laced? 

Couldn't cook would you still be in my life?
Now, Made Men, act like ya know then
Lisa Raye, Benzino, a perfect man
Yellow Man, Yellow City, here we go again
And with a beat like this ya know it's sickening

Would we, fall apart if things got hard?
Will love still stand when everything's gone?

If I get too comfortable, drop my guard 
Would you let the next man come and take my job?

[Lisa Raye]
Nah, never that, LR got your back
I never let another man come between that

That's right, I know I got a good girl in my corner
There when I need ya, run when I want cha
Me and you L, we takin it there
So stop playing games, you ain't keepin it fair

I'm down to ride wit'cha, use to cry wit'cha
All them otha chicks, they outta the picture
Maybe it's a rap, I don't know for sure

Never stay too long in your bed
Never lose your heart, use your head

Never let a friend fool you twice

Never be the first to believe
Never be the last to deceive

And never leave a moment too soon
Never waste a hot afternoon
Nobody's on nobody's side
Never stay a minute too long

'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock, 
Plymouth Rock would land on them. 

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking

Good authors too who once knew better words 
Now only use four-letter words 
Writing prose. 
Anything goes.

If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like, 
Why, nobody will oppose. 
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose 
Anything goes. 
When Rockefeller still can hoard en- 
Ough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows, 
Anything goes. 
The world has gone mad today 
And good's bad today, 
And black's white today, 
And day's night today, 
And that gent today 
You gave a cent today 
Once had several chateaux. 
When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
Lack baby clo'es, 
Anything goes. 

If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction 
Instruct Anna Sten in diction, 
Then Anna shows

When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up 
Now turns a handspring landing up- 
On her toes,

There I go, here I go, where I go, I don't know
I just can't help myself, so
Why do I do, what I do, when I do
Well, I can say so or I just don't know

Boys will be boys and what they usually say
That's the how and the why, that I act this way
That's the end of the line, I run out of rhyme
That ain't no crime so it's milk it out time

Let's see, I know it's some cosmic force
Causing my mind, you go,
Just wait out of course to another dimension
Not only of site and sound but of being a clown

Or an alley cat, or a dirty rat or a loud mouth brat
Well, I am all that, so if you ask me, why
I'm always in such a mess

A woman needs a man, like a fish needs a bike
There I go again sister know it all
No friends at all, 'cause I make them crawl

I can help showing off, all that I know
The whats can do, well is the wheres I could go
I know, it's makes the family very uptight
I know, it isn't right, but I do it every night

I'm probably don't belong here, I'm certainly were wrong here
Every night I have a dream, more like a nightmare
I see myself being born, Mum and dad are there
But it's not Marge and it's not Homer

Switched in a cradle, no wonder I'm a goner
I feel like a book, that's on the wrong shelve
I know, I shouldn't think it, but

Hey, you know, I kinda like this thing
It's sort of like music, but you don't have to sing
You got none of the work and all of the fun
Like a low cal donut or a fat free bun

By the way, that's reminds me, how about a snack
Just a small sandwich or a cold six-pack
A big pack of pork rinds that couldn't hurt
A cake for dessert will keep my mind alert

Oh, it takes a lot of energy to do this rap
I feel kinda sleepy, better take a nap
Not too long a nap, two hours, that's a winner
I wouldn't wanna sleep to a roast beef dinner

Roast beef with gravy and potatoes
Hot rolls and butter, lettuce and tomatoes
I know, I shouldn't eat it, I got to keep my health

'Cause I'm always gonna love you
There's so much you haven't seen that I can show you
But I never wanna shove you
Maybe ladies come and maybe ladies go 
(But I'll tell you) this lady's stayin'
And if you don't want to rush it we can take it slow
Baby it's a special thing, and there's no reason to explain
This is what so many long for, this is

[Chorus]
A mighty love, a mighty love
No push or shove, we're all dreamin' of
A mighty love, a mighty love
It's what we want, and there can never be no other love
I swear I'll never have you ride in back, in tow
(I swear) I'll never hurt you

Darlin' I could never be with anyone else
'Cause you're all I need to know
And I won't ever let you go
Baby it's a special thing, and there's no reason to explain
This is what so many long for, this is

Can't you you see I'm far to tough to let it hurt
I've had enough of your poison

Don't lay your hands upon me
Just crawl back where you came from
I shutter at the thought of you touching me
You've stained the love I gave you
Baby, not for long
So much I could have given you
But now you'll never know

I'm not blind to your poison

Don't make me laugh, you've told so many lies
And of all the lies you told me, baby, you're the biggest

You think you've hurt me

And a million blazing taxis raising a roar,
Here I sit, above the town,
In my pet-palliated gown,
Down in the depths
On the ninetieth floor

While the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet,
And the bars are packed with couples calling for more,
I'm deserted and depressed
In my regal-eagle mess,
Down in the depths
On the ninetieth floor

When the only one you wanted wants another,
What's the use of swank and cash in a bank galore?
Why, even the janitor's wife
Has a perfectly good love life,
And here am I, facing tomorrow,

Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
The rest of my life's been - just a show
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you
You can't turn back the clock, you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame ?
Ooh, I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
Better sit back and go - with the flow
'Cos these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but some things remain

Doing anything just to get you off of my mind

Trying to forget you is just a waste of time

There was something in everything about you
Baby, come back
You can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you

All day long wearing a mask of false bravado
Trying to keep up a smile that hides a tear
But as the sun goes down I get that empty feeling again
How I wish to God that you were here

Baby, come back
Any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby, come back
You can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you

Now, that I've pulled it up all together
Give me the chance to make you see
Have you used up all the love in your heart
Is there nothing left for me, is there nothing left for me?

There was something in everything about you
Baby, come back
You can blame it all on me

Just two people having fun

30 seconds later when the doctor slaps me
15 years til I get my permit
And then 4 more til we're in the backseat
Of a taxi, crazy youngfolk
And then sun came up but none woke
It's 4:20 when I made that dumb joke
I was saying something like blah blah blunt smoke
And then it's later in the afternoon
In my backyard when we write this tune
2 days later when I pen the verses
Probably 8 months til you first heard it
So punch the clock, adjust your tie
Spike the punch and touch the sky
Life is hard and then you die
So let's all go hard tonight

Remembering the days that felt so long
I bet you miss me
We spent the whole day dreaming, our minds made up
We're making history
Right now is right now
Too loud to die down
Right now is right now
No other time now

If time is money a second's a penny a minute's buck
A couple years are a milly I'm getting really really filthy
Bitch, get me a bathtub!
I'm filthy rich, watching my pennies stack up
I shower in a typhoon
If time is dimes then I'm a tycoon
I'll glue em together and the climb to the moon
Climb to the moon! Climb to the moon!

Every 24 we going like Jack Bauer
Hear the bell ringing I'm thinking it's that hour
Turning on my light and I set it to max power
Let's keep it going and going, I'm talking moment to moment we live the high and the low
And then when we're broken like cracking open a coconut
We pull ourselves together again and we gotta go

I bet you miss me
We spent the whole day dreaming, our minds made up
We're making history
Right now is right now
Too loud to die down
Right now is right now

I be up in the clouds tonight
Looking over my town tonight
In the shadow we found the light

Lisa Zane,"My name is Juanano de Castro
My father was a Spanish Grandee
But I won my wife in a card game
To hell with those lords o'er the sea

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

I played in a card game at Jolon
I played there with an outlaw named Juan
And after I'd taken his money
I staked all against his daughter Dawn
I picked up the ace...l had won her
My heart it was down at my feet
Jumped up to my throat in a hurry
Like a young summer's day she was sweet
He opened the door to the kitchen
And he called the girl out with a curse
Saying ""Take her, Goddamn her, you've won her
She's yours now for better or worse""
Her arms had to tighten around me
As we rode down the hills to the south
Not a word did I hear from her that day
Nor a kiss from her pretty young mouth
But that was a gay happy winter
We carved on a cradle of pine
By the fire in that neat little cabin
And I sang with that gay wife of mine

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

That night I got hurt in a landslide
Crushed hip and twice broken bone
She saddled her pony like lightning
And rode off for the doctor in Cholon
The lion screamed in the Barranca
Buck, he bolted and he fell on his side
My young wife lay dead in the moonlight
My heart died that night with my bride

You might win in a game at Cholon

Y sin embargo duermo entre mis sábanas soñando con tu olor, 
Vives aquí en mis sentimientos, me ocupaste el pensamiento. 
Quizas te añore más no hay nada personal. 

Aunque inventes los detalles y te encuentre en cada calle 
Yo te juro que no hay nada personal. 
Sacas a flote mis tragedias y de repente las remedias. 
Me haces loco, me haces trizas, me haces mal. 

Y así en los dos no hay nada personal 
Te llevo en cada gota de mi sangre y en el paso de mi andar. 
No necesito arrinconarte ni antes de dormir besarte 
Y es que en nosotros ya no hay nada personal.

Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

Lissy Estrella,"He aqui mi presencia
Pues he prometido que venia a verte aunque estubiera fligido
Cogiste el camino de la separacion
why tu no sabes como eso afecta mi corazon
Dios mio ayudame, why nunca permita
Que mi alma se destroce con esta visita
Mi mujer no me escucha, estando ahi acostada
No me mira no me abraza no me dice nada
Culpa tengo yo por no cumplir con mis promesas
Haciendote pasar muchos dias de tristeza
Por que no me di cuenta que yo actuaba muy mal
Ahora el remordimiento me quiere matar
Hombre al fin donde quiera que me paro
Las lenguas me persiguen cuando formo mi relajo
why asi sucesivamente pude perder
La gente habla sin parar sin tan siquiera saber
Pero ya es tarde
Ya escogiste tu decision, me abandonaste why asi cumpliste con tu mision
Pero yo lucho para que unque sea pueda sentir
why se muy bien que es imposible pero voy a seguir
Mi sentimientos hoy, se inclinan a tu vida
Manana buscare un camino a la salida, pues
Esto me encierra en un circulo vicioso 
Que me aparta de lo que pudo ser tan hermoso

Coro (2X):
Me acuerdo cuando te entregaste a mi
Me acuerdo como me aferraba yo a ti
Me acuerdo los dos sonando en una noche de pasion
No me escuchas, no me miras, se remuelde mi corazon

Te noto bien palida 
No eres la misma
Te falta la sonrisa que dibuja tu carisma
Te siento muy fria tus labios resecos
Hinutil te ves, why sin faltarte al respecto pero
Eso no importa te amo como eres
why nunca sentire lo mismo con otras mujeres
Dios me creo para quererte a ti
Yo maldigo el momento en que te perdi
why esta perdida es indudablemente eterna
Quisiera inventarme una luz moderna
Que alumbrara el camino de la felicidad
Porque sinseramente no acepto la realidad
Un ser humano no es capaz de aguantar este peso
Yo sufro me remueldo why lloro en exeso
Si crees que exagero pues lo hago por ti
Porque demuestro lo que tu significas para mi

Coro (2X)

Me acuerdo de la brisa que nos acarisiaba
Pues el viento a nuestra relacion apreciaba
Tu pecho junto al mio el calor provocaba
why asi por el estilo nuesras almas se entregaban
Me acuerdo de la noche en que tu me conocistes
Todas las caricias agradables que me hicistes
Me acuerdo de todas las palabras que digistes
Diciendome en secreto que el amor si existe
Pero con el tiempo el libreto cambio
Pues la malicia como siempre pasa se involucro
why yo un ser humano como los demas seres
Adopte el punto debil del hombre, mujeres
Ya en ese tiempo no pensaba muy bien 
De la pasion por exeso parecia un reen
Te ahogabas en tus lagrimas why en tus sufrimientos
Yo no se lo que pasaba con mi sentimientos
Luego escuche a todo el mundo decir
Que por mi la vida te ibas a destuir
Yo no crei en tus palabras te ignore como a un perro
why mirate ahora manana es tu entierro
Metida en esa caja sin poderte mover
Todos te lloran why me culpan sin poder comprender
Que fue un error no tina los ojos bien abiertos
Mi amor perdoname aunque hayas muerto

Listener,"When the moon shines at noontime, and the sun blazes at midnight
Dark and Night coincide, I stay inside and keep the lid tight
Catch side of the morning that passes by through my window
Another child is born, another dies, and still the wind blows
Spin slow, drawn into strong voice of reason
Standing there in soul thinking of summer ?
Just longin' for another season
For no particular Reason hear I stand-
Just rocked another show, just can't remember where I am
And my families far from here, but the stars are bright this evening
On this morning on this afternoon, just got here now I'm leaving
And I shall remember the marble just as clear as I do yesterday
Never dance with the Devil, 'cause I can't afford the hell to pay
When I blast through your speakers every time your pressing play
When I fish the phonograph so we could set the record straight
Dear god I pray-
Just let me show this world a better way
How you helped through to your heart and all the times you fade away
I get to, say these words and speak my piece to Catholic Crowds
Not certain if it's Day or Night but I know the time is NOW
And if we ever lose the purpose as a prelude to the sound
Lets just call it a Day, and burn my empires to the ground...

Ya, amazingly, Cask of Amanciatto
Cracks wide open and vibrates your bravado
So I escape, body-bagging, like I'm kinda like Monte Christo
World Tour, DL, Koffeshop, and I'm coming to your Bistro
We show bright when it comes to your ability
I'll be yellin' out homonyms 'cause I dwell in possibility
We gonna call it a Day, 'cause I know your feelin' me

Spill our guts with every breath on the mike
And hope you call it tight

If it's Dark make it Light

Workin' it out (out), placin' my feet to concrete
Hittin' the street with vengeance, steangence, so sweet
What bitter we consider every circle we pass
Probl'why the reason that I reason with class, so step fast
We pushed and finally pushed that was burnin' staying determined
And yearnin' 'cause the lessons we learnin' were life long (life long)
Its my song, I place to erase
And transpose all these average Joes
With weak flows-
Who knows not, -
The true livin' roles who ascended, blended
With the beat, compete, and apprehended
Today's feelin' all right, color all right
 Being blocked by the shotgun and pray every day and night
Now I've gone a full day without some wackness heard
The One's speakin' absurd-
Are finally heeding my word.   (ya right)
And now I'm left with nothing else to say
That be the Night that I Called it A Day (Called it a Day)

I'm gonna throw thoughts to a page
Let 'em fall where they please
Let 'em rise to the sky, rain down, on four seas
An ocean of possibilities that dwellin'
Yellin' at the top of my lungs convicted by stone tablets as a felon
A nocturnal being of love since the grown of time
Watch the sunrise with both my daughter's eyes
Permanent Shine, refine my reflection inside
Livin' to die, dyin' to live, and all glory given back to God

It was the Night that 24 turned into 12
Had to adjust my spiral off, from the top of the shelf
On the blank page, using the utensil of potential
I'm diggin' in my Brain so I could Rip the Instrumental
With 20 bars left, and I'm consistent from the intro
Lighting candle sticks, as the rain hits my window
Need to focus in, take the topic and let it flow
Got 8 down for the count and 16 to go
The Writer's blocks are stepping stones
Towards the metronome
I'm racing dead last
I'm head last
Placed on my prose
Nocturnal with my journal, a wordplay professor
The aggressor, resembling soda cans under pressure
I'm shakin' but not stirred, deterrent from my train of think
Now I'm aligned, readjusted to infuse the ink
I want to handcuff the hands of time
No great spirit here allotted for here's the sunshine...

[Chorus]

Bet I'm casting nets and dreads
The deep blue ways are wet?????
God's Silhouette, I want to palettes painted pink by suns and sets
BURNT from a long days work, but feelin' fine
Tip his cap and path the moon on his back, his day declines
Candlelight Switch as you slip into the evening
A courtesy to the sun, as it dips below the ceiling
Feeling sort of satellite, like the wind beneath my wings
Or the tightrope, or gravity keeps lunar kites on orbit strings
Man on the moonlight, dream before my time
Like the moon reflects the sun, I make the black begin to shine
Like the moon rewinds the waters, makes the ocean recline
I collapse your mind; I'm Syntax, but melancholy kind
Redefine the best, framed fresh in terms of holiness
Bless the mike, device, 'cause I get nice to keep the conscious
And I split tense mint's spit words like sentence fragments
Moon dust the must 'cause I ain't' in it for the cabbage
The incandescent presence spins, as I'm your present flame
But my name would flicker out my name syntax the wax and wane
For the name above names, I'm so glad that Christ came
The black bird bright the night, we called it a Day...

Shadows step on the one, on, under every tongue, run
Spoken sentence frags., spoken on shattered breaks
It's a black hole soul with my faith as I take

Break Minutes back with father time to coordinate seconds
I surround the 11th hour with sound as my weapon

Villain threatened to sweat the syndrome of the wicked
Heading for your Auditory where the Listener would stick it

Fiction, we're steel, when it breaks from the construction
Crushing your framework and far surpassing your presumption

Sunrays, like a score with notes my surfacing
Great mad at meteors or record the all heed

And when the, Sun Sets
Some one lets the mike down
We pipe down, unplug it and leave it hide down
But not before we retire the pen
'cause yo tomorrow we'll be back just to do it again

Uh, shackled and scarred
I still maintain my praise of dark days
A sullen world covered in pain
So from Dusk 'till Dawn, I represent his word

And the war of the angels has begun

All one in the same
In the streets and the alleys
Hear the battle cries sound
And the angels run for cover
As the world comes tumbling down

All through the night the battle is fought
They can never win back the lives they've lost
Down on her knees, in the tear stained dawn
She just closes her eyes and whispers goodbye

Into this world, so heartsick and war torn
Somebody better come and carry her away
Maybe this angel will live
To fly again someday

Io vorrei sapere
Chi governa il mondo
E cosa gli direbbe
Uno che e' senza lavoro
Vorrei sapere
Come si fa a cadere
E come puoi risalire
Senza farti male
Sono un ragazzo
Ricordatevi che esisto
Sono il re del Nulla
Mentre il Nulla ruba I migliori

Vorrei sapere
Perche' non e' reato
Fare la puttana di stato
Ed abusare ogni potere
E sono senza un letto
Ma mi basterebbe un tetto
Almeno fino a domani
Prima che la marea cresca
Sono un ragazzo
Ricordatevi che esisto
Sono il re del Nulla
Mentre il Nulla ruba I migliori

Lavorare per contare
Non si puo' dire che sia godere
Meglio impazzire
Che stare qui a vegetare
E sono senza un letto
Ma mi basterebbe un tetto
Almeno fino a domani
Prima che la marea cresca

Noi siamo tipi che fanno dannare
Siamo noi, proprio noi che non dormiamo mai
O forse siamo tipi che ti danno da fare
Se resisti resisto insisto anche nei guai
Cosi' io lo dico
Rifarei tutto
E qua posso dirlo
Ne farei di piu'
E voglio andare nel modo piu' perso
Per sognare il mondo all' inverso
L' onorevole dice che ora vuol progredire
Nelle case le strade le piazze e ora qua
E noi siamo ancora qui a farlo dannare
La nostra resistenza sono I guai
Cosi' io lo dico
Rifarei tutto
E qua posso dirlo
Ne farei di piu'
E sognare il mondo all' inverso
Voglio andare nel modo piu' perso
Per inventare un altro universo
E giocare col mondo all' inverso, 'azzo!
Oh no!
L' onorevole mi fa che ora si da' da fare
La morale e' che la torta e' ancora tutta sua
Ma noi siamo ancora qui con la fionda di parole
Gliele miro le tiro sempre anche nei guai
E sognare sognare il mondo all' inverso, sono perso
E fammi andare in un altro universo
E resisti resisti resisti resisti dai
Io resisto dai resisti

Il sogno vola
Aquila o farfalla
Che piomba giu' dal cielo come bomba che balla
E gira il mondo
Cambiando pelle
Confonde il suo nemico e resta sogno ribelle
Lo puoi ignorare o cancellare
Servira' soltanto questo a farlo lottare
Io giro il mondo
Seguo le stelle
Graffio la ragione e nasce il sogno ribelle
E gira gli occhi
Guardando il Sole
Per ogni cosa troverai le parole
Super-protetto ed inviolato
La tua vita non ha significato
Cambia artiglieria
Usa l' energia
Pretendi I tuoi diritti
Per primo quelli scritti
Cerca di lottare come se fosse amare
Quello e' il dinosauro
Non devi farlo alzare
No
In fondo agli occhi ho mille soli
Mille volte voglia di cambiare colore
Cambiare uomo cambiare pelle
Giorno e notte cresce il nostro sogno ribelle
Se giri gli occhi guardando il sole
Per ogni cosa troverai le parole

Pretendi I tuoi diritti
Per primo quelli scritti
Cerca di lottare come se fosse amare

Avvelenando il nostro viaggio
Noi ci inventiamo un altro sogno ribelle
E sta lievitando lievitando lievitando

Ma il crollo e' inevitabile
Tutti pieni e tutti salvi

Arma I gorilla coi soldi

Ma il suo cervello e' sepolto qua

Firenze sogna, Firenze sogna, Ullalla'
Il risveglio della sua voglia
Gentildonna lei, che sotto sotto si identifica
E fai viaggiare con il biglietto speciale,
Ma il viaggio e' gia' finito da un po'.
E ho tanta tanta voglia di credere
Che il mostro e' il cittadino normale

Ma e' il suo cervello che dorme qua!

Soprassiede sul presente

Qui non see'e' piu' spazio vita,
Centro del mondo morto
La signora non si sveglia dal suo sogno piu' remoto
Firenze e' ladra, see'e' chi ti paga,
In processione sotto la campana,
Mentre pregano che Dio protegga l'uscio e la bottega
Firenze e' bella , Firenze e' bella
Indubbiamente mi si stende sotto una cappella
Bianca stella dell' universo dell' inutile
Firenze sogna e sogna Firenze
Qui non see'e' piu' spazio vita, solo offerte modeste

E dalle tue vetrine vedo pesci in gelatina
Che si fa, I ""tirabaralla""?

E poi mostri fughe ed altri guai

Vuole un lui sensibile ai suoi guai
Vive insoddisfatta dell' esistenza
Cerca storia ad alta intensita'
Bella e dolce ha sete di conoscenza
Vuole mascherarsi un po' con me

E il suo nome e' Giulia

Sembra gia' sbocciare

Perche' la dolce tentazione di cambiare sapore
Mi fa pazzia'
E immagino la parte che e' piu' buona in te
La parte piu' vitale che see'e' in te
In te
In te
Belle sponde in cerca di conoscenza
In adorazione di sua maesta'
Organi ghiotti e prensile ebbrezza

Sono Adamo
Tu sei Eva
Sono il tuo serpente
Da vicino mascherata ti potro' sfamare
Ah ah perche'
La sana tentazione di cambiare sapore
Mi fa e ti fa offrire quella parte piu' nascosta in noi
E il tuo mistero e' una richiesta in piu'
Ah Ah tu sei una professionista o casalinga annoiata
Ci sei o ci fai una contorsionista sull' anguilla infuocata
Ma il tuo profumo io lo conosco gia'
Ne tuo mistero see' e' una sporca verita'

Tu sei Eva
Sono il tuo serpente

Torri come pere, il silenzio e' gia' passato
Nei corridoi resta il fumo della prima guardia
Uomo col fucile, il nemico e' la tua noia
Sei prigioniero e resti solo a difenderti dal freddo
Nuoto nel nero, dove sfioro le tue mani
Poi apro gli occhi steso in aria, e' la prima guardia
Esplode il mondo e resto solo, dalle mani nasce un fiume
L' alba e' un miraggio, che mi esplode dentro
Mi scuserai se parlo una lingua diversa
Un anno e' un secolo, 365 croci
E la tua privazione mi taglia la testa
Uomo col fucile, prigioniero della tua bandiera
E corri in tondo, testa in fumo, e' la prima guardia
Torri come pere, ma il nemico non esiste
Esplode il nulla e resto solo a difendermi dal buio
Grido l' allarme che mi esplode dentro
Perche' noi siamo al mondo problemi diversi
Un anno e' un secolo, 365 croci
E la tua privazione mi taglia la testa; avevo una testa
Un anno e' un secolo, 365 croci,
E la tua privazione mi taglia la testa
Grido l' allarme che m' esplode dentro
Perche' lo so che siamo problemi diversi; lingue diverse.

Rock and Roll!
Che sogno sudaticcio
Isterico e bizzarro
Con tutti gli occhi
Del tradimento
La tua famiglia m' ha inchiodato qui, Ahi, Ahi!
E spunta il prete
Col dito in cielo
Che mi vaneggia della fedelta'
Vorrei parlare
Farti capire
Che questa farsa non mi cambiera'
Ma la speranza e' l' ultima a morire
Chi visse sperando mori' non si puo' dire
Il cuore no, no, non te lo do
L' anello no, no scordatelo!
Mi sento freddo, paralizzato
Praticamente incatenato

Little,"I really messed up
Can you call me back babe?
I really messed up
Can you call me back babe?

I don't know why I've been making her feel this way
I ain't even smooth with my bullshit, I do it right in her face
It ain't like I don't love her, already gave her that ring
I hope you know, hope you know, how much I really wanna change
Why would I wanna wake up in the morning without you by my side?
And why do I gotta see you in tears just to make a nigga realise?

How do I explain it?
Every time I try to say no, I can't run from it
Baby you my favourite
Why do you be asking me questions when you already know that

I be doing dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb shit
I be doing dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb shit
I be doing dumb shit (I be doing dumb shit)
I be doing dumb shit (I be doing dumb shit)
I be doing dumb shit (I keep doing dumb shit)
I swear you're the only one I love but
I be doing dome shit

I swear I tried, I tried, no lie
Seems like I fail, I fail, every time
I'm sloppy with the cheating
Always catch me creeping
Don't ask me why I do it, 'cause I ain't got a reason
All I know is, I be doing dumb shit

I be doing dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb shit
I be doing dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb shit
I be doing dumb shit (I be doing dumb shit)

Oh naw, big Snoop Dogg
Party all night and we like blowing them bombs
Suit game Gucci, steak at the Palm
Cootchie Lootchie, black tie, bring me the ?
What it is, what it do, Snopp DO dub?
Is there any way that you can get us in the club?
Girl I'm buzzin' with a cousin and a set of twins
Diggin', duggin, shit here I go again
It's certain mo'fuckers that I run with
That keep me on some Bobby Shmurda dumb shit
I'm creepin' while you sleepin' but you woke up
Speak up, spoke up, make a nigga choke up
So right, so wrong, so what?
If we break up, I'm the one that's broke up
Picking and choosing, that lil' bitch with we
I woke up in the morning on TMZ, ooh wee

Uhm, I don't mean no harm
But your boy Black Ty's got a mean no arm
I got exposed when she went through my DMs
Now I got problems with my BM
I ain't wanna be him
Dumb shit, doin' the most when I know better
But doin' better, and knowin' better and showin' better
Dumb shit in these streets and doin' what I want
When I should be doin' what made you put me on
Your ? smart, you got your own everything
Million niggas want you but I'm the one you're drawn to
Been through it all but you still hold me down
Got pain in your smile and you refuse to frown
Baby I'm sorry I embarrassed you
Walking in a room full of bitches I didn't touch and they ain't even banished
Your voicemail full but the text said read
I pray to God our love ain't dead baby I swear

I swear I tried, I tried, no lie
Seems like I fail, I fail, every time
Can't get caught again 'cause I swore that I was gon' change
Got me working overtime in my phone changing all these names
But the city so small, they probably end up talking
And if she finds out, she'll probably end up walking
But I'mma take my chances to gamble either way
And why would I wanna start over when I got you at home?
Tryna get a million girls I'mma just end up alone

How do I explain it?
Every time I try to say no, I can't run from it

Little Angels,"Here in my room, in splendid isolation
alone in the gloom, in splendid isolation
sometimes I need to be, left in my own company,
so here I am, in splendid isolation.
I'm falling away, in splendid isolation,
I'm hoping I'll stay, in splendid isolation,
If they were right I'd agree, but it's them they know not me
So here I am in splendid isolation.
I'm floating in a sea of my subconcious thought,
and the skeletons are crewling from the closet walls,
No-one ever see's me, I don't make a sound'
and I don't know what I'm gonna do now
The motherless itch has got the best of me
trancending the things that I will never be,
but all along hallucinating life somehow,
I still don't know what I'm gonna do now.
The pressure starts to push me through my loving daze,
for a moment there I thought I'd lost me wicked ways,
It's not that I'm a leper when my mind allows
I don't know what I'm gonna do now.
Lennon is a memory in a student brain
gripping thought pavilions guilt in freedom's chains
the virginical construction makes the masses 'wow'
and I don't know what I'm gonna do now
Well I see the moon, the stars, the hemisphere
I see the future and it don't look clear
The past is re-appearing on my fevered brow.
And I don't know what I'm gonna do now,
Yeah, I still don't know what I'm gonna do now... ",Splendid Isolation,1992
Little Angels,"Breaking out of school and we were kicking hard
A lot of good dreams and a lot of false starts
Swore we wouldn't get old before our time
So what's the matter boy are you wondering where it went?
The memory's better than it was back then
You could not wait to leave it all behind
But there is one thing I know
I ain't quite ready to go
Too much, too young
I won't do time when I've just begun
Too much, too young
What about love, what of songs unsung?
Too much too young
I'll never go backward, I'll always go on...
I want more, give me, oh just a little bit more!
I don't want a house or a three piece suite
Those thing don't matter to me
I'm happy sleeping on your kitchen floor
So if you ain't happy following my star
Lend me some money, give me your old car
'Cause you don't really need it anymore
I've got some living to do
And I ain't waiting for you
Sometimes I wonder
If I'll ever live again
Well I can tell you
If I do, I'd make that change
I've got my share of regrets
But I ain't afraid to say
I've paid the price I have to pay
Well once upon a time
""When we were so young""
Well what were we then
Lies tattered and torn
Well I guess that's just the way it goes
I've got to move on to the other side

Little Angels,"December morning when the ship came sailing in,
The sailor boys with all their noise had come around again
She stood on the quayside, she was looking for a friend
he had caught her eye and now she'll try
to make him come her way (come her way)
So long, goodbye, nice to know you baby but it's time to fly,
he laughed as she cried and watched her dreams sail away.
Had one just like her on a far off Eastern shore,
and every town, that he'd sailed round was like the one before
and thought he said he loved her, his words were like his heart
they were empty as a summer stream that dries up oh so hard
(oh so hard)
[chorus:]
Sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away
Oh sail away again, away again
Every day somebody sails away,
Cried when he heft her, but she never knew his name,
Just a night of love to pass like ships and never meet again
She can't hold the tears, but she knows that one day
he will come around (come around again)
[chorus] ",Sail Away,1999
Little Angels,"I recall I called you up to ask you all my questions
And you replied you don't know why I can't take rejection
When I'm alone in company, and you're there in my sights
You smother me in mystery one more time.
[Chorus:]
Woman, woman, woman, womankind
Everyday you seem to blow my mind
Take a look at me and you will find
Everyday I love you more
Everyday I want you more.
So sweetly you persist in kind, so darkly and mysterious
Can't you see you must be blind, to not see I'm delerious
Fortunately you are not, a desperate proclaimer
That would be the worst thing on my mind.
[Chorus]
It's not the same without you
It's essential what you bring
You are deep within all time and space above
Ijust can't live without you, you're my oxygen supply
I'd drift deadly through my life without your love.

Hello there, why are you crying?
I know you're trying your best.

Hold her and tell her and you're gonna be OK.

Little Annie,"Yesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze may tease the candle flame
A thousand dreams I dreamed
The splendid things I planned
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the years ran away
Yesterday when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me, me, me and nothing else at all
Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
That never saw the waste and emptiness beyond
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay
For yesterday....when I was young, young, young,......young

So bored of bullets coming out of your mouth,
I got money only me my friend,
Give me one more chance to let you down again.

There's nobody in the bed clothes,
Just impressions where my head goes,
So, I'd better be a chamer,
'Cause, I didn't mean to harm ya!

So wait one second 'til daylight's low,
Let old time sentiment begin to flow,
I got no money only me my friend,
Give me one more chance to let you down again.

It's Friday night
And I'm heading to my favorite club
Skip the line
And greet the bouncer with a nod
Turn it up, turn it up
As I enter the floor
Live it up, live it up
'Cause I wanna let it go

Let's get down
I'm gonna dance like a god
Kill the bar with every shot after shot
DJ spin the tables
Lemme get wasted to your beat
'Cause I really wanna dance away
The bullshit of the week

We won't stop stop stop
Till the sun will rise again
We won't stop stop stop
Everybody lose control

You gotta wake up
The night is not over now
Dance, drink, party
All day and night
You gotta wake up
The night is not over now
Clap your hands
To the rhythm of this song

I've had a lot
But I'm up for some more
You gotta hail to the weekend
So back to the bar
And my vision gets blurry
But my dance moves are sick
This is why the girls are crazy
For my sexy big nose

So let's go
Bring the beat back
I wanna dance away the bullshit of the week
Bring the beat back
I keep on drinking
Till the week will start anew

Ебашь, блять (ебашь, блять)

While this planet is spinning
We will dance side by side
Let us give your life meaning
Right here tonight
Our hearts work like engines
Pump that acid, ignite
No pit stops are allowed
In here tonight
We're lighting your fire
Dance floor is burning alright?
What do we want? Party
When do we want it? Tonight
I'm dying for your sins
On this heavenly ride
I'm your personal Jesus
Just for tonight

And you can't make me stay here anyway now that I'm 18

She was more then just a homecoming queen and daddy's little girl

In a cloud of dust on a Greyhound bus she crossed the Cook County line
Slept all the way to Nashville,big dreams running through her mind
She said sure as I'm breathing I'm gonna be a big someday

It's about dreaming

Yeah,yeah,yeah,it's all about trying

It's been six years since she left home and she hasn't made it big yet
Oh but there's no second guessing baby,she's got no regrets

See I've never had any trouble falling
I'm just trying to find a place to land

I drew me a line in the crossing
Speed up when I should slow down
Well dang if I don't stay up in it
When I probably should go around
Always thinking that's its gonna be forever
Always thinking it's a good thing
All I know is that I'm giving everything I can
See I've never had any trouble falling
I'm still trying to find a place to land

Still tryin' to find a place to land
Still tryin' to find a place to land
Still tryin' to find a place to land

I told myself that I had it
I told myself I was through
Said I'm leaving love for the fool hearted
But that was before I found you
I'm on the edge baby I'm looking over
All my love here I go again
If I seem a little bit afraid
Baby try to understand
See I never had any trouble falling
I'm just trying to find a place to land

And there's nothing but lonely
So I left for doing only what it takes
To bridge the great divide

I would ride across the mesa
To the Arizona plain
And sail beyond the shores of sisco beach
I'd go down the Mississippi
To the land of hurricanes
Or I'll climb
Th hills of Tennessee
If that's where you are
That's where I'll be

Baby there's no measure to your words
Now it's your love that makes me
So I'll follow where it takes me
Even to the edge of the earth

And to know love is to know enough
To walk with you through this life

Put your rain in my river dry
Put your words to my lullaby

Held his hand and kissed his face
Then he closed his eyes
And I watched him slip away
Seems like only yesterday
He was young as I am now
So now the beat of the past
Yeah time is turning fast

I wanna live
I wanna love
Like one more day is
Never too much never enough
I wanna drink in
Everything that I can
Life is a vapor
Fire and paper
Gonna make the most of it before its gone

When I lay my head down at the end of another day
Did I keep it all to myself
Or did I give my love away
Did I hold who should have been held
So they remember just how I felt
Did I say what should be said
Will I wake with no regrets

I wanna live
I wanna love
Like one more day is
Never too much never enough
I wanna drink in
Everything that I can
Life is a vapor
Fire and paper
Gonna make the most of it before its gone

There was a man who walked the land centuries ago
He brought water the thirsty heart
And food to the hungry soul
He was here only thirty three years
But his life changed to world
And he gave up all he had
I wanna leave a legacy like that

I wanna live
I wanna love
Like one more day is
Never too much never enough
I wanna drink in
Everything that I can

Trying to get away so we don't get busted

I got a heart rush

Little Big Town,"They say you are who you hang with
It's no coincidence I wanna hang with you
Rise and fall together, travel is better in twos

Sometimes it feels like a magnet
The way that crazy always sticks with its own kind
I don't believe in ESP, but you can read my mind

Little Big Town,"You roll through life like a rolling fire
I bring the rain like a thunderstorm
Yeah we found peace on a battlefield
It all makes sense in love and war
It all makes sense in love and war

You and me
Wild as a willow in a hurricane
Strong enough to stand in stormy weather
We might be
Crazy enough to make history
Cause the world just isn't the same since we got together
And if we don't die young, we might just live forever

There are kings and queens upon their thrones
That have a love like you and me
Kingdoms rise and kingdoms fall
But love is last eternally
But love is last eternally

You and me
Wild as a willow in a hurricane
Strong enough to stand in stormy weather
We might be
Crazy enough to make history
'Cause the world just isn't the same since we got together
And if we don't die young, we might just live forever

They might sing us in a song
Or write our names up in the sky
Even when it's carved in stone
A love like ours goes on and on
A love like ours goes on and on

You and me
Wild as a willow in a hurricane
Strong enough to stand in stormy weather
We might be
Crazy enough to make history
'Cause the world just isn't the same since we got together
And if we don't die young, we might just live forever

Little Big Town,"Don't need no whiskey
When I've had a bad day
No prescription honey
When my skies are grey

No poppin' the pills
No smokin' the pills
That make me feel okay
But you go down easy baby
I could drink you by the case

You're my painkiller
A little dose of you goes a long long way
You're my painkiller
Oh will you take it away
You take it away

Don't need no fixin'
I don't need no therapy
You're love drunk kissin'
Is my kinda remedy
You're always lookin' to fall
You're like the hair of the dog
When I'm feelin' cursed
Don't need no doctor honey
I don't need no nurse

You're my painkiller
A little dose of you goes a long long way
You're my painkiller

You take it away

Little Big Town,"You say it's over, with a middle finger
But then you're calling before I turn off my ringer
And I answer 'cause I love to hear you're sorry for the 400th time

Well,
You try to leave me
But you can't do it
'Cause I'm the only one who puts up with your (censorship)
I know that secretly you love making out with me right after we fight

Well,
We're always fixing something that was never broken
We're on and off again like sobriety
Get back together every time you're done throwing a fit
So when you gonna quit
Breaking up with me

Well,
You think by now
We'd finally get along
But we only feel right when everything is going wrong
And we're back in the habit of cussing each other up and down

Well,
I hate your daddy, you hate my momma
But one thing we don't seem to hate is all the drama
But we never can remember what the hell we were yelling about

Well,
We're always fixing something that was never broken
We're on and off again like sobriety
Get back together every time you're done throwing a fit
So when you gonna quit
Breaking up with me

I don't know where you think you're going
Because you're stuck with me forever and you know it

We're always fixing something that was never broken

Little Big Town,"I ain't your mama
I ain't your priest
I got no time to waste on your saving grace
So, get up off your knees please

I ain't whiskey in a bottle,
I won't let you forget
No shot of Novocaine
No holy water, cleansing rain
To save your neck

Save your sin for someone else
Save your sin for someone else
Save your sin for someone else
Oh, oh, oh, not for me

Find yourself a back road
Drive 'til it runs outta dirt
Go on and scream it to the sky
Your filthy lies go on
Confess until it hurts

Save your sin for someone else
Save your sin for someone else
Save your sin for someone else
Oh, oh, oh, not for me

Jump in the river, let me go
Ain't deep enough to save your soul
Jump in the river, disappear
Can't be the one to judge you dear

Save your sin for someone else
Save your sin for someone else
Save your sin for someone else
Oh, oh, oh, not for me",Save Your Sin,2014
