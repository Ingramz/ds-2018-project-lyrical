Duke Ellington Orchestra,"""I'm the Sheik of Araby, 
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you're asleep 
Into your tent I'll creep.
The stars that shine above,
Will light our way to love.
You'll rule this land with me;",The Sheik of Araby,1996
Duke Ellington Orchestra,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1997
Duke Ellington Orchestra,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm
British museum had lost it's charm

How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles hadn't past
For, suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

Duke Ellington Orchestra,"I have almost ev'ry thing a human could desire,
Cars and houses, bear-skin rugs to lie before my fire
But there's something missing,
Something isn't there,
It seems I'm never kissing the one whom I care for.
I want Something To Live For
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouldn't I give for 
Someone who'd take my life 
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be.
Why can't I have love like that brought to me?
My eye is watching the noon crowds 
Searching the promenades seeking a clue
To the one who will someday be my

Soon he will open the door
Don't think because there's a ring on your finger
You needn't try any more

For wives should always be lovers too
Run to his arms the moment that he comes home to you

And the men will always be men
Don't stand him up, with your hair still in curlers

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon miss fanny bright
Was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upshot

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song
Just bet a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And, crack, you'll take the lead",Jingle Bells,2003

Though it shocks 'em I know why ask if shad do it

Come on and bring me, bring me shad roe

In shallow shoals
English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

The monkeys and the birds, bees do it
In, in water gates they quarrel but they do it
And if they can make up and still do it baby, how about me and you?

Oh, what a couple in love
Frankie was loyal to Johnny
Just as true as the stars above

Frankie went down to the drugstore
Some ice cream she wanted to buy
The soda jerk told her that Johnny
Was making love to Nellie Bligh

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

Now Frankie's dad was a policeman
She stole his old forty-four gun
Then back to the drugstore she beat it
Just as fast as she could run

After her man
Who was doing her wrong

Now Frankie peaked in on the party
She got a surprise when she saw
That Nellie and Johnny were making love
And sipping soda through a straw

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

So Frankie flew into a tantrum
She whipped out that old forty-four
And her rootie-toot-boom, that gal did shoot
Right through that hardwood swinging door

She shot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong

Bring on your rubber-tired hack

Duke Ellington's Famous Orchestra,"I know what you're doing
I see it all too clear
I only taste the saline
When I kiss away your tears

You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you
Are heavier by far

I believed in your confusion
You were so completely torn
Well it must have been that yesterday
Was the day that I was born

There's not much to examine
There's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious
If you have to ask me why

I say good-bye

[Chorus]
Cause I am barely breathing
And I can't find the air
I don't know who I'm kidding
Imagining you care, and I could stand here
Waiting a fool for another day
But I don't suppose it's worth the price
Worth the price, the price that I would pay

Everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction? I only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?

[Chorus]

But I'm thinking it over anyway

I've come to find, I may never know
Your changing mind, is it friend or foe?
I rise above or sink below

Please don't, you come and go

King 'Enry the Eighth had several wives
Including Anne Boleyn
And he kept an album of their lives
With all their photos in
As Anne Boleyn was on her knees
Dressed in her very best frock
King 'Enry shouted, ""Smile, Dear, please""
As 'er 'ead rolled off the block

'Old it, flash, bang, wallop, what a picture
What a picture, what a photograph
Comes the print in a little while
Lost 'er 'ead, but she kept 'er smile

When Napoleon married Josephine
There was just the same to-do
He galloped home from the battle scene
All the way from Waterloo
And as he came from orf 'is 'orse
To the boudoir where she sat
She said to 'im, in French of course
As he took of his big cocked 'at

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Lose their taste for kissing?

Duke Jordan,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me

I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

Duke of Burlington,"When I had you to myself 
I didn't want you around 
Those pretty faces always made you 
Stand out in a crowd 
But someone picked you from the bunch 
One glance was all it took 
Now it's much too late for me 
To take second look 

Oh baby give me one more chance 
To show you that I love you 
Won't you please send me back in your heart 

Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go 
But now since I see you in his arms 
I want you back 
Yes I do now 
I want you back 
Ooh ooh baby 
Yeah yeah, naw 

Trying to live without your love 
Is one long sleepless night 
Let me show you girl 
That I know wrong from right 

Every street you walk on 
I leave tear stains on the ground 
Following the girl 
I didn't even want around 
Oh baby give me one more chance 
To show you that I love you 
Won't you please send me back in your heart

Duke One,"Ay, mira hombre, por qué me tiras el poble sobre la cara, qué pendejo este, ay

Yo, hit that
Would you like a drink with me?
(If you don't mind, can I talk to you if it's all right?)
I want your body close to mine
(All night, while we're dancin' in the moonlight)
We could spend the night in ecstasy
(Kissin', touchin', caressin')
You know that you don't have to leave (tonight)
Sayin', ""why didn't I go home with you tonight?"" (ah ha, yo)

In fresh form out of town
Just breezed in, so I thought I'd take a look around
And find a party where the vibe is right
I'm talkin' maybe meet a honey, take her home tonight
So, shades on, top's off the whip
Takin' in the sights as I cruise the strip
As I pull up to a red light
I see this pretty little shorty in my headlights

This girl looked half black, yet half oriental
Man, this chick's got class and style
I'd like to ask her for her credentials
Name, address, numbers to dial
She plays tough when deep down she's gentle
It ain't hard to read the signs
This girl bangs like Dre instrumentals
Well, here's an acapella of mine

Girl, would you like a drink with me?
(If you don't mind, can I talk to you if it's all right?)
I want your body close to mine
(All night, while we're dancin' in the moonlight)
We could spend the night in ecstasy
(Kissin', touchin', caressin')
You know that you don't have to leave (tonight)
Sayin', ""why didn't I go home with you tonight?"" 

Scene two, all up in the club
Got my game tight, about to tear it up 
Could be a night that I won't forget
Boy, I'm lookin' for a honey, and I'm confident
I was dancin', but I had to stop
When I clocked this fly girl wearin' a halter top
She had her hair done, nails right
This señorita had a booty that was so tight

She was a hot girl who looked continental
Damn, her body looked so fine (looked so fine)
The way she spoke I saw her potential
If looks could kill, then she'd do time (she'd do time)
I don't claim to speak perfect Spanish
But I do know a few lines (a few lines)
This female's slicker than your average
And I gotta make her mine 

So, quieres beber conmigo?
(If you don't mind, can I talk to you if it's alright?)
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo
(All night, while we're dancin' in the moonlight)
Haz el amor conmigo
(Kissin', touchin', caressin')
Ya no me dejes solo tonight
Sayin', ""why didn't I go home with you?""

(Yo) tonight, I'm from a distance admirin'
Girl, you're lookin' so vibrant (oh, oh)
And I dig the way you move your body
Let's get out of this party
Maybe we can get naughty
Say bye, bye, girlfriends
'Cause just in a minute we'll be gone if we're in sync
(Yo, can we dance?)

Would you like a drink and some lovin'?
But leave your husband at home
Unless he want a bump on the dome
Come along, rub alongside me
Put your phone on silence, just breathe
What you're doin' is right, what I'm doin' is wrong
Only time I do right is when I'm doin' a song
So, expect your ex to exit the area
Exterior vex, perplex by the sex
What you drinkin'?
Drink's on me, find me on drink and a drink on me
You can ride next to me, girl, it's ecstasy
Here's somethin' for your ex to see
It's messed up how I slide up your thigh with my right hand
You want to ride all night, then I can 
Don't be shy of just one one-night stand, now, let's go

So would you like a drink with me? (Oh oh)
(If you don't mind, can I talk to you if it's all right?) If you don't mind
I want your body close to mine
(All night, while we're dancin' in the moonlight)
We could spend the night in ecstasy (in ecstasy)
(Kissin', touchin', caressin')
Yeah you know that you don't have to leave (tonight)
Sayin', ""why didn't I go home with you tonight?""

No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin

When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Drunk on my champagne
You got into the air
Across the River Wye

How to let go
I was falling
Through the Tivoli sky

Dulce Maria,"Quererte fue una estupidez total
Un paso mas allá del bien y el mal
Una tormenta de dolor, una historia de terror
Un sueño rosa que hoy es gris, palabras sin valor

Sé que fui, ingenua y me sentí
Colgando mariposas en el cielo
Y hoy estoy temblando al ras del suelo
Fui, ingenua y te volví, mi aire
Y hoy la vida es un desierto
Por amarte a corazón abierto

Intentaré reconstruir mi paz
Quemar tus besos, no mirar atrás
Te di mi oxigeno y mi voz,
Hice un mundo para dos
Hiciste que creer en ti, y después dijiste adiós

Colgando mariposas en el cielo

Estas pensando en mi

Still stands for who I am
Every stone laid
Is a bridge made to my past

The house where I grew tall towers over me
Shadows bring everything back in soft light
I wouldn't change yesterday, not in my life
And so I live in a house of no regrets

There are many rooms inside my head
Corridors that wind through time, never end
They are journeys meant to be
Every house is part of me

The house where I found love lingers
Sends me shivers
Like the first time
Stairways I climb to the heights

The house where I grow old will be free of ghosts

Dulce Pontes,"Viene un suono di campane
A svegliare I girasol
Pol si distende verso il mare
Tutti I girasoli guardano là

Verso il mare più in là
Dove il rosso fuoco è il sole
E nell'azzurro sale

E l'anima del mondo
Respira in me
Quando l'onda del mio corpo
Dilaga su di te
Mare che si placa nell'alba

Che concerto le campane
Sulla rotta dei gabbiani
Quando risalgono dal mare
Sul duomo rosa medievale

Voli di gabbiani lassù
Cullano I campi
Di girasoli

Come io cullo te
T'addormenti in me
Io in te

Dulce Pontes,"Soon the leaves will fall
I'll watch the lonely moon in the sky
And when dawn breaks, I'll listen for your heartbeat
But what I'll hear is your last goodbye
The saddest sound of all

We'll meet again, we'll stare and then
We'll smile and speak as strangers do
And all I'll be to you is someone you once knew

I know every line
The way your eyes shine in the dark
You'll take your fire, your tenderness, your strength
And the memories here in my heart
Are all you'll leave behind

We'll meet again, we'll stare and then
We'll smile and we'll stop and speak as strangers do
The love we made will fade away
You'll wave and as you turn to go, I'll know it's true
All I can be to you is someone you once knew

After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'

You're gonna feel bad
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had

There'll come a time when you'll regret it

Dumoustier Stompers,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

So now, hurry up Mister Man
Load just as fast as you can
The plane is already late
I'm gonna get home as soon as I can

But they said the road was bad
I started to take a train but a freight was all they had

Want to you please let me know
Because my baby needs me
And I really really must go
How bad I wanna see my woman
I guess you'll never know

And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay

I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off

By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
Cause I'll be on my way
See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say ""I told you so""
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

Of your dirty little deeds

Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
so I'm leaving you behind
Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know

She knew it in her heart of hearts 
She said ""Tonight you'd better pull yourself together, 
Because tonight I'm gonna pull myself apart!"" 
Out on the streets 
Everyone is searchin' for a thrill 
But she's the only one that's out there 
really dressed to kill 
And she said ""Listen to me, it's not a tragedy, 
This time I'm gettin' thorough and now there's 
something you can do for me!

TV angel with her eyes full of smoke 
Gazin' at the hero, he's so mucho macho 
He shrugs, he says ""This must be some kind on joke."" 
As she pulls on his cigarette and loves him to distraction. 
But she cries, ""I don't wanna feel like a machine 
I'm not the only one who wants to feel the in-between 
That's why I'm deep into this state of fascination 
That's why I've lost the art of conversation. 

And oh, oh, take me to the Wild Places 
If you wanna see what's really in my soul 
But you'd better keep your eye on where my pretty face is 
Cos in the heat of the moment I just lose control 
In the heat of the moment, I just lose control!"" 

Eyes out of focus, the sharpening of blades 
The sad tension, reek of patchouli 
Even the jokers are dealin' in spades 
It's one dimension, it's all so passé' 
Just then a voice said, 
""Honey, it's too late to change your mind"" 
Her face tightened 
I could see she'd found a new design 
and she said, ""Listen to me, it's just a fantasy 
This time I'm comin through 
and now there's something you can do for me... 
There's something you can do for me!

Al caer la noche, en tu portal
Te preguntabas, así sin voz
Dónde estarís al despertar
Al despertar no busques más
Porque ya habrás llegado donde
Siempre quisiste ir

Y allí donde Dios quiera que tú estés
Mis saludos van por ti
No había sitio, en tu razón
Para ningún disgusto más
Tus penas salen libres al sol
No te acompañan donde tú vas
No volverás, nunca hacia atrás

Porque habrás encontrado
Más sitio en tu corazón
Y allí donde ya puedes descansar
Mil recuerdos en tu honor
Viste una seña, que te llamó
Sin saber adónde iba a parar
El cielo negro fue tu visión

En el momento para marchar
Y al despertar, no busques más
Porque a los que dejaste habrán
Viajado junto a ti
Miles de voces a tu alrededor
Te desean ser feliz",Senales en el Cielo,1989

La leyenda contará lo que ocurrió
Un amor que por maldito se prohibió
Tu pañuelo en mi pecho why un flor
En mi escudo se dibuja un halcón
He perdido apellido why posición
Mi caballo, mi armadura why mi honor
Oh!, tierra de castillos me viste nacer
Me despido de tus campos por última vez
Más allá de esas colinas te esperaré
Una vez que el gallo cante al amanecer",La Tierra del Amor,1998
Duncan Dhu,"Te despiertas al amanecer
Sabes bien lo que debes hacer
Ponte la careta hoy también harás reír
Aunque luego se olviden de ti
Ya no quedan chistes por contar
Pero tú te las arreglarás
Ya no queda tiempo para volver
Hacia atrás y de tu cansancio comerás

Y hoy no te sientes con humor
Pero la gente pide más
Hoy tu sonrisa se escondió
Te la tuviste que pintar
Hoy no tienes ganas de reír
Y el estómago te haré sentir
Te recuerda que hoy también quiere comer
Y no tienes mucho que ofrecer",Tu Sonrisa,1998
Duncan Dhu,"El bosque se cierra a tu alrededor 
Las flores enseñan sus hojas al sol 
Bajo la sombra no hace calor 
Los pájaros saben canciones de amor

El bosque se cierra a tu alrededor 
No pierdas el tiempo mirando el reloj 
Hace tiempo que marca las dos 
No sueñes despierto en tu habitación

Sigue así
No busques la razón 
Que te ha hecho llegar hasta este lugar 
Viniste del monte cruzando el mar 
Y qué harás ahora

El bosque parece llorar, cuando te vas 
Las flores se mueven al verte pasar 
El búho en el árbol no quiere cantar 
Señala tus pasos en la oscuridad",Volveran Por Mi,1998
Duncan Dhu,"Capricornio la llamé
Es mi isla interior
No me iría allí sin ti
Ni jamás lo pensé
En tu risa se oye el mar
No parece un mal lugar

No tiene dirección
Ni hay forma de llegar
Sin una invitación
A no salir ya más
El diario y un café
Y tus besos después

Una pieza lenta que
Algún día bailé
Todo esto y mucho más
En mi feudo personal
No habrá lugar mejor
No busques mucho más

Elige un buen rincón
Y olvida lo demás
No mires más allá
No está en mitad del mar
Corónate y serás
Tu rey particular",Capricornio,1999
Duncan Dhu,"Después de estar 
Perdido tanto tiempo tiempo 
Después de ti 
Después de los disparos

Detrás del sol 
Detrás de los aviones 
Como pistolas 
Probadas al amanecer 
Como el invierno en madrid 
Así caeremos los dos 

Con grandes gafas de sol 
Y sin dejar de mirarnos 
En los espejos

Después del sueño mas lento

Do you think this is fun?

What's at the heart of us?
Did you ever find out
Did you ever find out what's at the heart?

You don't really care, you don't know what they mean
Raiding in the closets, skeleton keys

You should get over yourself 
Like everyone else and enjoy 
The girls and the boys 
And everything in between

The things that annoy you 
You hide- far, far away 
And life just passes you by 

Are you gonna give up 
Are you gonna give out 
Ain't that a shame 
You've got no one to blame 
But your conscience 
If it doesn't make sense 
I know that only too well 
So tell me 
Did it happen one day 
When the day that you faced 
Wasn't happening 
It just didn't bring 
Anything more
Anything more than despair 

Do you remember, morning would come 
And just like a child filled with the sun 
And the hours never seemed long 
Where have those days gone? 
Beyond us,
Or so you would believe 
But I can't agree, those illusions 
Will you ever get through them 
And find the diamond
Find the diamond inside",Serena,1996

The darkness comes and the darkness goes
Oh babe why don't you let it go?

I mystified the simple life
I covered up with consciousness
I saw myself and broke it down

The worse it seems to get""

You need her more than anything

That only she can heal

Was all that you could have

Some may kneel before the sun

In the heart of everyone

Bullets paint the blue distance
The mirror's stained from every gun
Still, I say that it glistens

Within the afternoon

Felt the mothers' wounds
The broken-hearted people
Burying their own

Some may kneel before the sun
Me, I say there's a mirror
In the heart of everyone

Strike the bell, and we listen
Light the candle, and we're shown
The gods themselves throwing incense

Brought the earth my seed, but it would not flower

In some fool's dream? In the ending hour?

A clanging toy, a clanging toy
Empty, strident
Brought my eyes, in utter ruin, sightless
The tears I cried, the tears I cried
Still so frightened

Brought my heart to feed, but my mouth was fire
Brought the earth my seed, but it would not flower
Where the jeweled stream? Where the eased desire?
In some fool's dream? In the ending hour?

Where the silver streets? Where the blossoming?
Where sounds so sweet?
Where songs of spring?
Where words for things?
Where golden memories?
Where quiet seas?
Where certainty?

Where all might cease, the talk, the want, the posturing?

Brought my heart to feed, but my mouth was fire
Brought the earth my seed, but it would not flower
Where the jeweled stream? Where the eased desire?
In some fool's dream? In the ending hour?

Where poetry?
Where mystic harmonies?

Where love that frees?
Where security?

Where sympathy?
Where tranquility?
Where rest in peace?

I've always heard that you're the best
At housing knights and castles high up in the air
So I beseech you, Mr. Chess
To let me sleep inside your bed
And would you sleep too, would you sleep too in the chair?

You see, I dream of may things
Of floating, solitary kings
Of pawns and people with blue sequins through their hair

The jesters sings, the bishop brings
The queen a hollow following
And all the pawns and people stop and people stare

So, I too stop
At three o'clock
I stumble to your door
And knock

And ask to see you, ask to be you, Mr. Chess
O, Mr. Chess
Now, I beseech you, Mr. Chess
To let me sleep, to let me rest
To let me dream, to let me sing without a care

I'll sing you castles in the air
And I will sleep too
I will sleep too
I will rest

Duncan Sheik,"And there were mermaids, weren't there
Sweet silver mermaids
All through that gray Trafalgar Square
Such silver mermaids

They were young, and they were fair
They brushed their bronze and
Dusky hair
And whispered, ""Come, Sad Stephen, come, and play here""

""You will love, you will be loved
You will grow up, and do so much
You will be strong, you will be sung
By all the mermaids, silver mermaids""

And once they'd sung their satin song
They beckoned to me from the fog
They spread their arms and lifted
Pale-portrait faces
I was taken

To their coral-cavern halls
To rooms with oyster shells for walls
To sandy nooks, and pearly books and ivory dolls

In ivory stalls, in ivory stalls

And there were mermaids, weren't there?
Sweet silver mermaids
All through that wan, forgotten square
Silver mermaids

They were young, and they were fair
They brushed their bronze and
Dusky hair
And whispered, ""Come, Sad Stephen, come""
And I was taken

Was I wrong? should I have run?
I wanted all, I wanted young
And portrait faces
I was taken

Did I love? I didn't care
Did I grow up? Well, unaware

And was I strong? And was I sung?
How do I haunt Trafalgar fog
And find I want so much, still want

And no more mermaids
No more mermaids",Sad Stephen's Song,2001

That little thing in tears they call the truth
It said, be done with her, she's done with you

That used to hold her tight until the dawn
And now they weep to find that she is gone
This is how my heart heard

I forgot the taste of fears
And how they haunt the lips you're kissing
And how the soul can waste its tears
On someone who is missing

And how I shed such tears but never cry
This is how I want her
And how I kiss her lips and taste goodbye
This is how I want her

I forgot the taste of fears

Sitting near my bed
We have a conversation

Good morning Mr. Cut-throat
These are most exciting times
We are surrounded by fools and crooks,
Strangers that give us dirty looks,
So many different people to despise

It's tearing you apart

I don't mean to complain, but it seems a little strange

Well done!

(and now you see it)
That no news is good news

The popular pursuit of absolute truth
And who has the time for such remote endeavors
You want to disappear
How did you end up here?
I don't mean to complain
But it seems a little strange
Take me to your leader
I sure could use a laugh

And he sleeps in a birdbath

By a bunch of fucking clowns!

They all sing...
We all sing...

Without you
I'm lost on the moon!

Duncan Sheik,"Still, you're near
Still, you call
The fears and sighs, I hear them all

Like those Christmas times
When we would not sleep
Just lay there, warm and proud
All your wishes for something somewhere...

And it's never far
Oh, what all we were
But all that's changing now
All your wishes for something somewhere

Through this different town
With its different streets
Still the thought of you

And what's left behind
When each evening ends?
Roads to where we've been
All your wishes

All your wishes for something somewhere",Something Somewhere,2004
Duncan Sheik,"So, my friend, we're left out on our own again.
Oh yeah, but who knows where we're goin'.

Come, we'll walk the night, we'll listen
To all of those no longer with us,
Calling from some lonely distance.

Take my hand -- come on
And on we'll go.
Take my handâ?¦

Something's lasted
There's a home.

So, my friend, we'll head out with our hopes again.
Oh yeah, we'll face whatever's thrown us.

Come, we'll walk, we'll find what lingers
Of the things that might have been there
Other dreams of other wintersâ?¦

Take my hand -- come on
And on we'll go.
Take my handâ?¦

Bury the laughter
There, with the tears we've known.
Trailing our shadows,
You and me on this road.

Built of sadness,
There's a home.

It's our homeâ?¦
Bury the laughter
There, with the tears we've known.
You and me, shadows,
Traveling this long road.

Built of sadness
For what's happened,
Something's lasted
There's a home.

It's our homeâ?¦
Now we're homeâ?¦",There's a Home,2004
Duncan Sheik,"Simeon, he was a man,
Held his heart out in his hand,
A hollow land of autumn breeze

Evenings in the brittle rain,
Leaves that fill the barren plain
With simple embroideries

In the temple yesterday,
Was a man, who came to pray,
Who couldn't stay and couldn't leave.

So, he fell down on his knees,
Sued for grace and sued for peace,
A little ease, and not to grieve

Marion, she met a man,
Took her to Jerusalem,
To take a stand, escape a scene

To wander in the honey sea,
Drink the milk of Memory,
And never be herself again.

In the temple yesterday,
Was a woman came to pray
Who couldn't say, and couldn't see.

So, she fell down on her knees,
Sued for grace and sued for peace,
Sued the priest, to set her free.

Chased by storms
Always safe

Rush out of bed
Tornado is dead
In its wake, sunlight
The land in uproot

Taken down south
To a hurricane town
Fallen down bombs
Wishing for snowbound home

Robbed by time
The shadows of birds
Fortunes won and lost
And still, I'm wandering

Duncan Sheik,"Maybe I'll just whisper
Neither humble neither proud 
Listen if you care to 
But I will not sing too loud
No, not tonight 
Just before I'm over and out
I wanna sing of better times 
I wanna sing of hope
We've heard those empty promises
Sound like such a joke
And so I stumble
So hard to say, so difficult
Sometimes I am not able
To separate my dreams from false cliches

[Chorus:]
But the more and more I hear it
I feel the spirit rise
The people here are talking 'bout
The oneness of our lives
Maybe I will turn away, maybe you will run
It just maybe a foreshadowing
Of what's to come

So anything can happen,
I don't believe in fate
I won't try to convince you 
'Cause it's getting kind of late
There it is. Just before I'm over and out
My parting shot-just to say you hold the reins

[Chorus:]

And will you struggle
To realize this earthly paradise
Isn't so far above us? 
So put away those poisonous ideas
You know it's just ideas
They're the only...enemies 'round here
I see your eyes are closing 
Didn't mean to keep you up
There's more that I could say now
But I guess I've said enough
So sleep well 
Just before I'm over and out
Yes, sleep well, just before I'm over and out

The more and more I hear it 
I feel the spirit rise

Duncan Sheik,"Don't get me wrong, I'm feeling O.K.
But when I'm without you, it's just not the same
Don't misunderstand me, I'm feeling alright
But when I'm without you the day turns into night,  into night
You dream of a future, a possible place
Where we lie together face to face
And I'm looking forward
I will not deny
I dream of a future made for you and I
You and I

[Chorus]
And then I'm with you
No longer alone
When I'm with you
It feels like I'm home
And you are with me
No longer alone
How could it be?
It feels like I'm home
It feels like I'm home

I look through the darkness into the sky
The moon up above me brilliantly shines
I've never been happier watching it glow
I'm here by myself, but I know I'm not alone...I'm not alone
I look through the brightness into the sky
The sun up above me, spitting out fire
Call me a child, call me naive
The world is much brighter
Than it ever used to be

How it brings you back
It will always be
Only as green

The universe
Is plain to see
And I try not to rely
On another world

Duncan Sheik,"Awful sweet to be a little butterfly
Just swinging over things and nothing deep inside
Nothing going, going wild in you, you know
You're slowing by the riverside, a-floating high and blue

Or maybe cool to be a little summer wind
Like once through everything and then away again
With the taste of dust in your mouth all day
But no need to know
Like sadness, you just sail away
'Cuz you know
I don't do sadness
Not even a little bit
Just don't need it in my life

Don't want any part of it
I don't do sadness

Spring and summer
Every other day
Blue wind gets so sad
Blowing through the thick corn
Through the bales of hay
Through the open books on the grass

Sure when its autumn
Wind always wants to
Creep up and haunt you
When silence got you
If it's heartache well, it's sorrow
Winter wind sings under cries

Spring and summer
Every other day
Blue wind gets so pained
Blowing through the thick corn
Through the bales of hay
Through the sudden drift of the rain
Spring and summer

Actually I better go
Walk as far as my house with me
I wish I could
Then why don't you?
Eighty lines of virgils, sixteen equations, a paper on the hopsboard

So maybe I should be some kind of laundry line
Hang their things on me, and I will swing 'em dry
You just wave in the sun through the afternoon and then see
They come to set you free beneath the rising moon

'Cause you know
Spring and summer
I don't do sadness

Not even a little bit

Just don't need it in my life

Don't want any part of it

'Til there is no one to ask me?

I was gone
So gone
Gone so gone
For a while

How many times will I sleep by your side?
Turning and dreaming and scared
A fairground that's shut down
As you ride away
My horse won't go anywhere

I was gone
So gone
Gone so gone
For a while

I was wrong
So wrong
Wrong so wrong
For a while

How many songs will I try to write
All with the same thing to say?
I've got two tickets left
Won't you please stay with me?

What is the sound of things that you lose
That you never have found?
You're finding the way or turning around

Sometimes the sweetest is the time that you waste

I won't dry your eyes or say it's alright
Cause sometimes that's the lie even if she kissed your cheek
Still the days become weeks, no rewind, no repeats
Steal your heart, life is hard, never easy, believe me

There'll be no more questions, maybes or mights
Darkest descends, run out of light

Sons and daughters sometimes they do meet

How I felt a strange late summer heat

Distant oceans, wild notions

All that you can do is cry, to heaven above
Just like us, just like us

You learn how it feels
Hearts break and never heal

Secret places, stolen gazes, soft exchanges all you ever dream
It will change you, how it pains you when its cold
And all you can do is plead,

Duncan Sheik,"I present to you a story
Set upon a northern shore
The denizens of lighthouse
During times of war

The foolish things they did
The foolish things they said
I'm sure you will agree
They would be better off dead

Lilly keeps the lighthouse
She's afraid the unknown 
She's no ray of sunshine
So mostly she's alone

And no one cares about her longing
Or the dreams on which she's fed
And though I'm sad to say it
She would be better off dead

Next we have a sheriff 
Charles is his name
He's something of a sideshow
Every sheriff is the same

Will he stand for justice
Or something else instead
Either way it hardly matters
He's better off dead

When everything is done
And everything is said
Life is naught but pain
It's better to be dead

Release your heavy heart
Rest your weary head
When all the world's at war
It's better, it's better

Witness Yasujiro
He hails from old Japan
He searches for redemption
In this strange and foreign land

And now he works for Lilly
To earn his daily bread
But the most that one can say
Is that he's better off dead

Please welcome young Christopher
He's come here on a train
His father flew to heaven
On a fiery airplane

He's come to live with Lilly
And he's got visions in his head
He may be our main attraction
But he's better off dead

When everything is done
And everything is said
Life is naught but pain
It's better to be dead

Release your heavy heart
Rest your weary head
When all the world's at war
It's better to be dead

Duncan Sheik,"Listen if you will, I have a tale to tell.
Of an unfortunate man, the name of Solomon Snell,
And the philosophy he should have embraced,
That says no matter what you do,
You'll never be safe.

Ring the bell, ring the bell
For Solomon Snell.
Too much trust,
Is the road to Hell

Rightfully nervous,
He took every precaution,
He paid three armed men to drive him to Boston.
But wouldn't you know it, he was broke on arrival.
His own men robbed him and took off in style.

So he wanted to marry, a girl who was true,
And on the basis of her name he would fidelity prove.
She had a handsome cousin she would visit in Charlotte.
Well she said he was her cousin,
The brazen harlot.

Ring the bell, ring the bell
For Solomon Snell.
He played it safe,
And it didn't end well.

Ring the bell, ring the bell
For Solomon Snell.
Too much trust
Is the road to hell.

He caught yellow fever,
Down Charleston way.
Before you knew it, they were digging his grave.
But he was most terrified of being buried alive.
And so to his finger a bell was tied.

You see Snell had arranged for a man to be paid,
To listen for the bell when he was buried in his grave.
But the man got drunk, and when the bell did sound,
Solomon lived but he stayed in the ground.

No one heard a sound.

Ring the bell, ring the bell
For Solomon Snell.
Too much trust is the road to hell.

Ring the bell, ring the bell
For Solomon Snell.

But it wont end well.

But it wont end well.

But it wont end well",The Tale of Solomon Snell,2009

The answer is they cannot love this much
Nobody can

Hope you find it in everything, everything that you see
Hope you find it, hope you find it
Hope you find me in you

With its ups and its downs, its rain and its sun
She decided that her work, it was done, time to have fun,
And found a game to play

Then this part of the game
She completely forgot where she'd hidden herself
And she spent the rest of her time
Trying to find her parts.

Hey I'm just walkin' outta foot locker strollin' through green briar
Stepped in the food court just gonna but a bean pot
Ay cool cool cutta, cut her to the finch
If a girl gotta future behind her, I'm up in it

And I like a pretty lady with a tailback mouth

Dungeon Family,"Ask not what the family can do for you
Ask only what you can do for the family

This is my pledge, this is my pledge to we and all those that come after
Let's talk about it 'posed to assimilate, insyncopate
Euphoric you raw superstitions, appear with information
Hesitation, metaphoric in a solid state of logic

Focusin' on me and the family, gawkin'
Parallel parkin' was a art form
Atilla the Hun, school that I wrote to write
Spoke for some to speak, provided cobblestone

Stole to steal parone, cut the heart up out of Caesar
I protect the black Madonna shrine from seizures
I survived the 80's child killings
Excruciating pain like a root canal without a filling

Forever we, pillars in this stature in this Ascap rapture
Wordplay that will snatch ya, mangle ya mind
Signed upper bull pull, I relinquish
To become forever more Excalibur
To become forever more Excalibur

Caliber unknown, infinite in stature
Indiscriminate fracture, syndicated rapture
Indicated capture, syncopated nature
Defeated we raise the wager no secret, I hate the majors

But they major players, so I'm a gladiatin'
Not so glad we waitin', niggaz is graduatin'
Fuck what flag we wavin', kids is misbehavin'
Parents is worse than Satan, apparently church is pagan

Sworn away my freedom through words that sing my freedom
Rebirth the world of the earth in intent to spin my freedom
Prepared to defend the next-us didn't get in for no Lexus
Didn't get on through connections or to get off my erection

Fuck the soft and the wetness, luck is lost in election
Bucket that caused the detection sent to impossible reactions
Still to much to achieve, we build to much to believe
Fear to much to receive, appear before you achieve

We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur
We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur

We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur
We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur

Guess I was wrong, [Incomprehensible] sworn
Promise to make it show that, the legend of dungeon live on
Even knowledge I known and heights I flown
I alone can't snatch the sword up out the stone

The charged chastities here, have to cock outta fear
Matter of fact, I apologize
Lyric far, witness to suck the star
May the force be with us, for we are

We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur
We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur

We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur
We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur

Eyes'll have you so puffed up until you eventually flow up
And bust on their or buck to their [Incomprehensible]
Drag the slayer, oh we ain't forgot about you playa
You still don't weigh enough, I gotcha beat off the rip
From the jump, keep it still to relapse on that junk

Pump fake, off ya feet
Fall on this sword ya beat with eggs on ya face
Amazing grace, how sweet it is the shit we spit
Thicker still, niggaz don't deserve to live

It's gettin' so goosy where a girl
Can kill her baby the next day by takin' a pill
Breakin' off beat, when they blow the horns
They open up the rest of them seals

Out wit yo' head for not keepin' the ears real
Walkin' through the valley of the drop
Bone lookin' for my damn drone
Where ya at? I see ya, I see ya
Come on let's get 'em dawg come on

If I got one my nigga you got one
He got one, they got one
Them motherfuckers gon' make them a damn gun

We are the proud holders of the Excalibur
We are the few, we are the strong

And I gonna put you on your place
By the grace of god
Because I don't really think you ball that hard
That's what your mouth said

Now why'all whole motherfuckers is just rotten

You think you quick on the draw puttin them ten times is mo better
We got all the superstitions they got all the cheddar 
You don't own nothin
You bought from them we might as well say we just leasin
Ain't no reason then why the preacher and his false teachins
Keepin hot coals over your heads
Yeah when I looked into your eyes I will see that

Untrapable, meaning I can't be place between none

It's unbelieveable, bare a resemblance to Broken Mold

Make ya move it's moderate, no need to speed
It's inevitable you arrive in due time indeed
Now is the, time and place to in-vade the empty space
I'm a profectionist, I never pressure the pen space
But I wouldn't be amazing without God's Amazing Grace

I'm still here waitin' cause you still my nigga.

Hold up, ay, 
I just sent another kite, to my people that's locked, 
They say he had another fight (again),
They say he got 30 days in the hole for beatin 
A niggas ass for tryin' him like a hoe (that's my nigga),
Treetum gone, all over coke, hit him with conspiracy cause he was on the boat, 
They say he'll do 15 at the most,
We prayin for an appeal, but it is what it is,

Yes sir, and those who died by the gun, 
And now they dead and gone,

For those who went strong, and they lost they mind, 
I'm doin this one for the low income, the slaws,
The homies, the basers, and bongs,
For the good, they got to suffer with the bad, 
And for the mother of the child with the dead beat dad,
For my lil brother who was just in the crash, 
Now he can't feel his arms or his legs, man,
I'm doin this one for the tears that were shed, 
For all the niggas that was sentenced to the state or the feds,
To all the does who was givin' they bows 
After talkin' to the door while they homeboys told

Listen bra I know you waitin' on that day to jump, 
But keep ya head up boy because its soon to come,
Cause you know the streets miss you they ask about you errday, 
So you gotta maintain,
Get up out this okay, though I know you hot 
Cause your homeboys shittin' on ya, fuck them niggas tho,
You don't need em on the real homie, real, real, 
You already know what it is, bein' locked up niggas don't give a fuck,
Only real niggas gon keep it treal with you, 
And you know I'm blood, what you need I'm a get you,
'cause ima hold it down on some real shit nigga, 
Bein' caged in the pen ain't for a real nigga,
True fact not fictions, I'm all in, 
Do ya time like a G fuck what the streets said,
The way you drugged gurantee youl be on ya feet man, 
Ain't no bullshit bra, you will see I ain't playin'.

You see I do it for the hustle, 
And the niggas who stood over pots and watched that shit bubble,
And them niggas stood on the block and watched that money double, 
And the ones who stood up to cops and ain't said nothin',
Look, ain't that many alive, but I know plenty ridin, 
My lil' brother locked up, doin 25,
And when I get some change ima try and change that, 
And just to think about the niggas I can't bring back,
And can we please have a moment of silence, 
For all the niggas that's no longer around us,
For all the niggas that pro-longed in the county 
And metro-s and T-G-K and star-k, nigga we block raised,
Cops couldnt stop pay, we got rocks so we open up shop today, 
Times is hard, plus life is a motherfucker,
We gotta ride low-key and ride under cover.

Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.

I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart

Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
