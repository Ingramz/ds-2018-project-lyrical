Seahorses,"Don't believe in Jesus
Don't believe in Jah
Don't believe in the wars we fight
Just to prove how real we are

I believe in lovers, I believe in friends
I believe in heaven here on earth
'Til the, the beginning ends

Love me and leave me
Love me and leave me
Love me and leave me
Leave me to love

Don't you ever tell me
It came from above
Just love me and leave me
Leave me to love

I believe in heroes, I believe in stars
I believe that we'll meet one day
Say hello in some astral bar

I believe in brothers
I know you know who you are
Here's to those who bore us
And made us what we are

Love me and leave me
Love me and leave me
Love me and leave me
Leave me to love

Don't you ever tell me
It came from above
Just love me and leave me
Leave me to love
",Love Me and Leave Me,1997
Seahorses,"Did I step down from a spaceship
That was orbiting your earth?
Shining like a star above
You way down in the dirt

Won't you take me to your leader?
Won't you show me 'round the sights?
I don't think I've landed here before
But then again I might

'Cause your face looks so familiar
But your eyes have lost their shine

I can take you round the universe
In a hot wired police car
We can ram raid Mars and Jupiter
And drive right through a star

There's one thing you can do for me
Hear me now, my friend
Tell me, tell me, tell me why
All good things must come to an end?

Did I crash land in your conscience?
Did I rain on your parade?
Am I your alien abduction nightmare?
Won't you be my slave?

Is there anybody in there?
Hey, there earthling get the phone
Your virtual reality's a house, it's not a home

Well, the truth as strange as fiction
Is right there in your eyes

I can take you round the universe
In a hot wired police car
We can ram raid Mars and Jupiter
And drive right through a star

There's one thing you can do for me
Hear me now, my friend
Tell me, tell me, tell me why
All good things must come to an end?
To an end, to an end
",Round the Universe,1997
Seahorses,"He's falling down a staircase, he don't know just how to stop
He's forty flights from bottom and sixty from the top
He's a man on a mission as brave as he's sane
A lonely life's ambition got a sieve for a brain

You won't miss your water 'til your well runs dry
You can't taste the truth when you're drinking a lie
It's a long hard road but we've got to make it through
So tell me, tell me, tell me what in the world, are we gonna do?

So don't dig yourself any deeper
The only color that I see is red
My life will be so much sweeter
When I'm standing, tall on your head

And when you reach the bottom when you hit my killing floor
I'll be there to greet you and show you to the door
It's a bright sunny day, not a cloud in the sky
So say your prayers one last time 'cause today's the day you die

So don't dig yourself any deeper
The only color that I see is red
My life will be so much sweeter
When I'm standing, tall on your head

You should be better off dead
My life will be so much sweeter
When I'm standing, tall on your head
You gonna say now and don't let me down
No, I'll never forget now, you put me down

You can run like a cheetah
Oh, I'll still catch you
You can tear me to pieces
Do anything you want to do
",Standing on Your Head,1997
Seahorses,"Please, may I leave the table? I don't think that I'll be able
To swallow your family values again today
Because a giant squid, he stole my wife and kid
Full story and pix, ten pence off your Weetabix, yeah, yeah

Sometimes this world just drives you crazy, lately
Yeah and the smoke gets in your eyes
Run the exhaust back inside, close the window and take a ride
I've got a place to go, there's nowhere to hide on Suicide Drive

Drive as fast as you can, I speed therefore I am
And no one can tell me better when I'm high
But the earth's full of holes and outer space is closed
It's mine and I'll wash it, as fast as I like it while I've got it, yeah

Sometimes this world just drives you crazy, lately
Yeah and the smoke gets in your eyes
Run the exhaust back inside, close the window and take a ride
I've got a place to go, nowhere to hide on Suicide Drive

Mile after mile
Super-duper, mega-hyper, choca-blocka aisles
Where do we go from here?

Sometimes this world just drives you crazy, lately
Yeah and the smoke gets in your eyes
Run the exhaust back inside, close the window and take a ride
I've got a place to go, there's nowhere to hide on Suicide Drive

Com seu jeito

Ela, tipo, faz e acontece
Para os mano, pira e enlouquece

Seal,"In a church, by the face,
He talks about the people going under.

Only child know
A man decides after seventy years,
That what he goes there for, is to unlock the door.
While those around him criticize and sleep...
And through a fractal on a breaking wall,
I see you my friend, and touch your face again.
Miracles will happen as we trip.

[Chorus]
But we're never gonna survive, unless, 
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive, unless, 
We are a little

Cray, cray, cray, 
Crazy yellow people walking through my head.
One of them's got a gun, to shoot the other one.
And yet together they were friends at school
Oh, get it, get it, get it, get it no no!

If all were there when we first took the pill,
Then maybe, then maybe, then maybe, then maybe
Miracles will happen as we speak.

Oh darlin,
In a sky full of people, only some want to fly,
Isn't that crazy?
In a world full of people, only some want to fly,
Isn't that crazy?

Crazy,
In a heaven of people there's only some want to fly,
Ain't that crazy?
Oh babe, oh darlin', 
In a world full of people there's only some want to fly,

Golden Dawn
Immersed in Crowley's uniform
Of imagery

I'm living in a silent film
Portraying Himmler's sacred realm
Of dream reality

But drawing to the ragged hole

I'm living proof of Churchill's lies
I'm destiny
I'm torn between the light and dark

Where others see their targets
Divine symmetry
Should I kiss the viper's fang
Or herald loud the death of Man

And I ain't got the power anymore

Don't deceive with belief

Just a mortal with the potential of a superman
And I'm livin' on

Of bullshit faith

You can tell me all about it

Would I see clearer than my eyes would see,
Oh I, if I showed I love you angel?

I try to make better way.
To the castle that I make,
Where the moon lights the way,
And it's invisible by day.
I hear temptation sing yeah!
Just let go and I will take you there.

Now would I feel better than I might be?
Would I see clearer than my eyes would see, yeah?

If I fell in love with angel?
If I showed I love you angel? Oh I oh ah o wah

Is to cry out loud.
But you don't know how.
No way, no-one,
No-one understands.

And when you hurt someone so much that still they die loving you.

And Puff that mighty dragon
He ceased his fearless roar
His head now bent in sorrow

Without his life-long friend
He could not be brave

Sadly slipped into his cave.

Throw me a lifeline, won't you please
I'm watching the news, but I'm not at ease
Throw me a lifeline, won't you please

Come to the place where I used to play
And put on your peace wires for a day
Look at the radios in the sun
Can you let it pass you by?

Heavenly, trust in me
Feels like yesterday now

I look at the world and it's heavenly
I see a miracle place to be
Why is it anyone has to die?
Did they ever ask you why?

When will you talk about being free?
Pain isn't all that it's meant to be
Hanging another one out to dry
Is there any reason why?

In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair

Scarlet ribbons, there's magic in the air 
Scarlet, scarlet ribbons for her hair",Scarlet Ribbons,2001
Seamus Kennedy,"I close my eyes and picture the emerald of the sea;
From the fishing boats at Dingle to the shores of Dunadee.
I miss the River Shannon and the folks at Skipparee;
The moor lands and the meadows,
With their forty shades of green.

But most of all I miss a girl in Tipperary town,
And most of all I miss her lips as soft as eiderdown.
Again I want to see and do the things we've done and seen,
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar,
And there's forty shades of green.

I wish that I could spend an hour at Dublin's churning surf;
I'd love to watch the farmers drain the bogs and spade the turf.
To see again the thatching of the straw the women glean;
I'd walk from Cork to Lairn to see their forty shades of green.

But most of all I miss a girl in Tipperary town,
And most of all I miss her lips as soft as eiderdown.
Again I want to see and do the things we've done and seen,
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar,
And there's forty shades of green.",Forty Shades of Green,2005
Sean,"My brother
I?m writing this 
To tell you I love you
You showed me what true friendship means

This life is rough
But knowing you has made me better
You shared your strength

And I want you to know
Brother
You help me to grow
I thank you 
Where ever you go
Always be/stay true

Sitting here
Thinking of 
Tough times I came through
You were there, helped me make it through

This life gets rough
But knowing you has made me stronger
You shared your faith

Take a sled and slide down the slope,

On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

Seán Cannon,"In a neat little town they called Belfast 
Apprentice to trade I was bound
And many an hour's sweet happiness
Have I spent in that neat little town

As sad misfortune came over me
Which caused me to stray from the land
Far away from me friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band

Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band

I took a stroll down broadway
Meaning not long for to stay
When who should I meet but this pretty fair maid
Come a-traipsing along the highway

She was both fair and handsome
Her neck, it was just like a swan
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band

Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band

I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid
And a gentleman passing us by
Well, I knew she meant the doing of him
By the look in her roguish black eye

A gold watch she took from his pocket
And placed it right into my hand
And the very first thing that I said, was
Bad 'cess to the black velvet band

Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band

Before the judge and the jury
Next morning, I had to appear
The judge, he says to me
""Young man, you're case it is proven clear

We'll give you seven years penal servitude
To be spent far away from the land
Far away from your friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band""

Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band

So come all you jolly young fellows
A warning take by me
When you are out on the town, me lads
Beware of the pretty Colleens

They'll feed you with strong drink, me lads

I lost a battle here and there

Your sharpened arrows pierce my heavy heart
And carry on to bleed me dry

All my life, though some have changed

Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

Relax and take notes,
While I'm put you up on game
Get a sweeter connect, then if I put you up on cane,
But you should grab yourself a seat and a whisky double,
Because the girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble,
They like a little danger and might not admit it,
But they on for the chase and they want us to come and get it,
Plus they love a young thug that's overflowing with swag!
And keeps his women all draped in new louis vuitton bags!
With Louis Vuitton pumps, look at her walk to 'em,
I like open toe straps, but sg talk to em!

Necklace, bracelets and all other types of jewelery,
So, shop till you drop, or till it makes you psychotic,
Here's a triple black card, it ain't tricking if you got it!
Others will stay content if you just making 'em laugh,
Send 'em to the spa, get a massage then bubble bath,
So later on, they can dance and throw a drink in they hand,
And try any and everything they never did with they man, me!
So get loose and slide off your damn garments,
Show 'em whose the boss, they take orders from the sergeant
There's places on your body that I'm trying to find,
So in the sack, talk to me, tell me whats on your mind,
And I got plenty more to learn if you's invested in me,
They don't love me for who I am but who I'm destined to be,
And for that!, I'll give you everything up under the sun,
Cause in the end, all the girls just wanna have fun!

This feels like the coldest day in a hurricane
Looking through a glass window
And you're screaming to the top of your lungs
And the bell's done rung
And the crowd can't hear you
And all that I can see is a building burning
(I just gotta rescue my baby)
But you don't even recognize me

And even though the feeling's been gone, I just wanna be here
Would you pick up the little pieces of remains
I'm going down, the plane is smoking
And the only one who can save me is you, but you want to

Throw me away
Away, away, away

Girl, 'cause it changes
And it ain't got to be no real reason
You start to live the dream and before you know
There's a door that opens, and the moment you walk in, it close
(Maybe it's somebody else or a situation that you can't help)
Ooh, love, oh, love, oh, love, oh, love
Just ain't what it used to be

Bid farewell to everyone
Kicked that bucket out the door
Where I'm goin' I won't need it anymore

Gonna lay my burden down
Take a bird's eye look around
From the tall pines of Carolina
All the way to the Wall of China

So I go sailing 'round the room
Through my window, cross the silver moon
No flesh and bone to hold me
I'll finally set my soul free
When I go sailing 'round the room

Life may be just but a dream
Rode my boat on down the stream
To wake up on a different shore
Wind up as something I ain't never been before

I could be a drop of summer rain
Fallin' down on an Oklahoma plain
Gonna leave the world behind me
Look around and you will find me

So I go sailing 'round the room
Through my window, cross the silver moon
No flesh and bone to hold me
I'll finally set my soul free
When I go sailing 'round the room

(I will be)
In the smoke from Mauna Loa
Morning mist on the Shenandoah

(I will be)
Grain of sand in the Kalahari
Magnolia by the Mississippi

(I will be)
Bird song when the day is breaking
Words of love when your heart is aching

Blue bonnet by the highway
I'll be everywhere and always

When I go sailing 'round the room
Through my window, cross the silver moon
No flesh and bone to hold me
I'll finally set my soul free

When I go sailing 'round the room
Through my window, cross the silver moon
No flesh and bone to hold me

She was around for a lot of time, she
Wandering around the hotel hallways in the middle of the night
Carrying a little yellow cardboard box
And she inhabited the place like a butterfly

There was this kind of sadness about her and they
And she did have this light
And nobody ever knew her real name

Those times, I see her coming on a [Incomprehensible]
Stepping through broken bottles and gum
Carrying her shoes, barefoot
People said she was crazy

About, about six months before the fire, there was a
There was a big blackout, famous summer blackout
She walked around through the halls giving everyone candles
Scared everybody away in the end

And when the fire happened, you know
Everybody assumed it was her
Terrible fires all that year and little ones
I don't know if it was fair or not
But everybody blamed her for it

And then one day she, she just vanished
And later they said her name was Alice
The whole time I never knew her name

Got nothing on you babe
I’ve see your eyes without their clothes
And I didn’t look away, I didn’t look away.
When the blossoms sweetness fades
When your tongue is tired
There’s nothing you need say
There’s nothing I require
In a lawn of endless green
You are one bright yellow dandelion flower
Are you glad for what you’ve seen?
Are you glad we shared these hours? Are you glad?
There’s fruit on every tree
Far more then we can eat
You share yours with the humming birds
I’ll share mine with the bees, I’ll share mine with the bees
Does the wind ever go out dancing?
Does the day prepare a feast?
Does the rain get tired of falling?
Does the night ever get to sleep?

Before the summer starts to wane
I love the way our hearts fit
In this jigsaw love we’ve made,
In this jigsaw love.

Seen it waving at daybreak, seen it smiling at daybreak

Sayin that I only care about hoes in my cash knots,

They see me lookin good,
They sayin I done changed,
Ain't a member on the block no more,
But I'm still the same,
So that's not the case I'm busy gettin money on tour,
Man I put that on my hood, hood, hood
Man I put that on my hood, hood, hood
I'm the same man

Thru the recession I was helpin people thru the drought,
This is for my people who is locked up and ain't gettin out
And bart came home, no more phat time,
While he was locked up I made sure that his daughter fine
Yea, now that's real people, they got people registered 2 vote now how much realer do it get?
And I love givin back, puttin smiles on kids faces,
Payin off tuitions makin sure they get an education. (it ain't nothin)
I would never turn my back on y'all, sis we used 2 window shop but now we tearin down the mall
Now I'm puttin up position to helpin make a difference,
I know I mess up sometimes so I ask God for forgiveness

They see me lookin good,
They sayin I done changed,
Ain't a member on the block no more,
But I'm still the same,
So that's not the case I'm busy gettin money on tour,

Man I put that on my hood, hood, hood
I'm the same man",For My Hood,

Sean Kingston,"Mommy just dry your eyes, mommy don't you cry
I know we've been through hard times and the struggles
And I just wanna tell you I love you

Only fifteen put under pressure
First month 27th day
They took away my mother
I was left to be raised by my brother

Taught to be a hustler
Mommy gone gotta stick together
Stay strong through the stormy weather
Became a top seller, look how we stacking this cheddar
When you jump mommy life would be better
Just like Rihanna you can stand under my umbrella

You know how to make me better
Even when we lose our cheddar
Even through the stormy weather
You hold me down

Mommy just dry your eyes, mommy don't you cry
I know we've been through hard times and the struggles
And I just wanna tell you I love you
(x2)

Seventeen got a little money
Feeling kinda blue
Cause it's looking you doing 10 to 20
Riding being broke ain't funny

It's all being hungry
But I'm a keep hustling for my mommy
Until I get rich like puffy
Never had a blamby

You said I can be all I can be
Some day I'm a buy you Miami
So when I win my Grammy
You coming cause I do this for my family

You know how to make me better
Even when we lose our cheddar
Even through the stormy weather
You hold me down

Seventeen now my mommy's gone
Can't wait till she come back home
Missing her face like dust till dawn, while she went away
Never think it be this long

I feel like crying while I'm writing this song
Can't wait till that day come on
When she leave the place

Hey whats up mom, how you doing?
It's been about 2 years since I saw your face
I miss you like crazy
Know the money orders the pre paid costs

Being on my own
No Knee Kurt Canino
But I love you though
This for you

You know how to make me better
Even when we lose our cheddar
Even through the stormy weather
You hold me down",Dry Your Eyes,2007

At first everything was cool
Until I meet her sister Lauren
Got introduced to each other and then everything changed

But I'm 17 what you expect me to do
I guess we'll charge it as a part of the game

In the wrong part of town, in the wrong time of day
I got love in me heart but my niggas don't play

I don't waste time with soldiers I convo with presidents
Look at my circle niggas success is evident
Rappers run and hide when they hear me drop
But they ain't rainin nigga that's me spitting on the top over colors

Sean Kingston,"See when I got Mercedes money I went and got a Mercedes
When I got that Bentley money I went and got that Bentley
Now if you ain't help me get it don't tell me how to spend it
And yes I know the rules, never marry Robin Givens
Mozzarella over bitches
So we call me them bitches cheese heads
Lambo leap in that pussy like them green bay
Lambo sweet look like sugar on the freeway
And I'm riding dirty cause I'm so UGK
One, two, three way four an' four makes eight
Nine times outta' ten its an eleven or a twelve gauge
Friday the 13th that's the day that hell raised
But y'all boys too weak like fourteen days
I'm so clean why wouldn't I be
I be with Ben Frank so much he startin' to look like me
I'm a smoke my weed cause I don't wanna smoke yours
And I pour four every time I pour
Like, was you saying something bitch
If you talkin' bout us then you ain't talkin' bout shit!

I wake up this mornin' eyes half closed
And looked in the mirror and say damn I'm cold
Damn I'm cold and my hoes
Pimp shit nigga keep payin' my hoes
Damn I'm cold man I'm cold
I say damn I'm cold
Hot damn I'm cold

When I got that slab money I put the Remy on blades
When I got that lac money
I candied the Escalade
Gotta screw on my deck
A house or two on my neck
A couple cars on my wrist
And bitch I'm ready to wreck
We bout to this for Pimp C
So pass me a bottle
I'm bout to pop the top on em
Like a slab or a model
Turn it upside down
And pour it out for my lil' bro
And pass me another one so I can pour out a little mo'
Fresher than osmium
Cleaner than wax floors
I'm slick as aluminum
Swingin' my lac doors
The Franklin's you foldin' them
We tryin' to stack those
Before you play the role
You gotta learn how to act, hoes!
Swingers and crank foes
And tippin' trunks of pain
Hangers give neck and hoes
And flip with nuts and hang
It ain't a thang
It never was and never will
I put that on my life
Bun B forever trill

Fuck you right all right
Going at your neck like a fuckin' dog bites
I woke up this morning eyes half closed
Looked into the mirror and said damn I'm cold
Damn I'm cold and my hoe
Pimp shit nigga keep paying my hoe
Damn I'm cold man I'm throwed
I said damn I'm cold, hot damn I'm cold

Is it the ice in the piece or the ice in the chains?
Is it the ice in the watch or the ice in the rings?
Or the bracelet, face you feel the chill in yo veins
Could it be from Bun B or that boy Lil' Wayne

Or could it be the two-seater on them thangs
Got on a couple gold chains so dang it dang
I swang a thang, from lane to lane
Yeah, its getting hot and you starting to feel the flame
Bun

It's getting brick and you starting to feel a breeze
And the temperature's going down
Best'a get you some sleeves
And you best'a get you some G's
Fore you lose your control
And we turn your whole neighborhood into the north pole

Like brr
Machine gun brr
I am a beast grr
Money machine brr
F-U-C-K C-O-P's
I say I know when they say freeze
Yeah!

Ok you already knew
No pussies, no rats, no Tom and Jerry show
And I woke up this morning eyes half closed
Looked into the mirror like damn I'm cold
Damn I'm cold and my hoe
Damn I'm cold, man I'm cold
I say damn I'm cold
Hot damn I'm cold",Damn I'm Cold,2008
Sean Kingston,"[Chorus: x2 Chamillionaire] 
Can't like the hustle man, don't hate the player hate the game. 
Gotta love it man. 
Catch me flippin' grippin' grain in the turnin' lane, trunk on bang. 
Cause its an underground thing cause I'm an underground king.

[Bun B]
Its Bun B the king of the Trill and I'm bringin the steel 
Bringin' the maximum bitches that gangsta shit im bringin it back. 
I went from slangin' the crack to slangin' the tracks and slangin' my skills 
Since 92 and slangin' it still 
So bring who you feel bring who you feeling 
Bring em around and I'ma lay them down its just another sound boy killin'. 
Rude boy wanna test better make sure rude boy got on his vest 
Walk with a bunch of bananas on his chest. 
These monkey niggas on that monkey shit. 
Best keep a revolver I boss like a gorilla and kill 'em with a revolver. 
So go on pimpin you's a chimp and I'ma do that 
You ain't ready for the blow-back 
DJ you already do that 
So bring who you wanna bring on I'ma go King Kong 
I'll squeeze him till he come up off his cream like a ding dong. 
Standin' on top of the towers the trans go beatin' my chest 
So it's best you and your mans know I'ma underground king.

[Chorus: x2]

[Pimp C]
I'ma underground king for life, get my good and put in your wife
Tattoo thats you on a island nigga you a pig you buyin' the q. 
Sound scan and short bro bump right like a tylo. 
Fake price buy ice use it for the ton of snow. 
Ball faced lier try to call me a snitch I ditch
The full population with a ball faced bitch 
If it wasn't for that Bun niggas might not know my name no more 
But every time they gave me my mic he told them hoes to let me go. 
DJ trippa suckin' on nipples pimpin on grands she playin' with cock 
Pull that zippa she aint Twista she get money fast now its in her mouth 
Nigga you know what I'm about if you silent I'm gonna ride 
I run the south this is my house I tell the truth even when I lie. 
Atlanta is the country and Georgia boys cool 
Its all you out of town fagot niggas fuckin' up all the rules. 
That ain't blow thats reckon 
That ain't dro thats popcorn 
You fuckin' right they comin' back 
Like you sellin' it cheap cause they stepped on, bitch

[Chorus: x2]

[Chamillionaire]
No reprise for the cars I'm stayin' up in the foreign. 
Wanna wake up my neighbors and the other clicks in the mornin'
If me and Bun wasn't tourin' I swear the game would be borin'
If bein' fake was a felony all yall rappers be starrin'. 
In Americas most wanted I missed that Pimpin' and Pac 
So it seems that me and Bun B is the realest people you got 
My paper chase gettin' faster I'm even beaten the clock. 
When it comes to gs the tick tock is gonna get beat to the dock. 
Gave birth to the hustle so let my fetus be shown 
When I pull out them baby Benjamin's and I skeet on your dome. 
I'm secreetin' the dough so don't leave your women alone 
Ill turn my dick to a dollar and give your women a loan 
My presence on the Texas streets is somethin' easy to spot 
I'll assassinate concrete for the G's I'm bleedin' the block. 
Boys'll see me on swingers and think its easy to plot 
But I bet them boys behind me wont be beamin' up Scott.

There's nothing in this world
There's not another girl that could satisfy my needs
There's nothing in this world
There's not another boy that could make me feel so sweet
Cos me love life's so right 
When she hold me so tight, how she kiss me goodnight
Cos he fills up my life
Like the Sun, he shines bright
Boy, come with me now

The first night me meet her
Yes me senorita me never want to leave her no
Because the gal look sweet and treat
And me really want to take her home

Cos she look nice and is a one of a kind 
When me look up in her eyes then she got me mesmerized
Picture perfect like a Kodak moment
When she kiss me goodnight and she feeling up on me

We been there from the jump, never front, never stunt
Never done what a average girl done
And I can tell by her body language
She feels my emotions

And got me anxious
So that's me type
me and me angel
And me really have to let her know

She's the woman of my life
Oh yes she so right
So please let the chorus go

I saw you from across the room
Looking so fly I gotta talk to you, yeah
It didn't take a sec to see
That you're the only one who wanna rescue me
I can't lie, boy you're my type of guy
And there's nothing in this world that can stop me from loving you

Girl you put me in a good mood
And me love the way you flex too
We could chill girl, after school
Cos I ain't tripping girl it's up to you

And since then we've been inseparable
Cos I did everything to get next to you
Since day 1 you know I stay true
So ever since then it's been me and my boo

[Chorus]

There's nothing in this world, there's nothing in this world
There's nothing, there's nothing

I wish we had stayed home

Lennon and Yoko
We will play all day long
""Isn't life crazy?"", I said

There the sweetest of pleasures are found

But there will also be
More to question, yet more to believe
Oh tell me where?
Where is the someone who will turn and look at me?
And want to share
My every sweet-imagined possibility?
The more I live - the more I learn
The more I learn - the more I realize
The less I know

Each page I turn

I'm literally yours hun
Cause' I never seen a ass so big with a waist as little as yours hun
And by the expressions on them hotties grills
I know they want to holla at somebody real
And I'm usually lookin' for somebody skilled
Enough to make a nigga say aye aye aye yo niggas get mad 'cause I may slay they hoe
But I don't want to let the a.k. spray so
Stop face fightin' me, like ya face frighten' me
I do this every year so I ain't never scared
I do this everywhere and you ain't never there
They sayin' this everywhere, how could you never hear

[Chorus: Sean Paul]
If you want to roll with the thugs tonight
Lights, camera, action can you feel the hype
Hit cruise control blazed Kryptonite
Well its alright, baby its alright
If you want to live up and free your life
Come through let we kick it 'til a morning light
If you want to roll with tha thugs tonight
Well its alright, baby its alright

[Verse 2: Sean Paul]
So get with it, we want (to) hit it, we nah quit it
And I like tha way you body set and how your clothes fit it
I want you give me some of it because minute by minute
Temperature it all a rise because you thighs and all you hips, style
You shockin' it, you a rock it, you a kill it
And a one thing the Dutty Paul want to predict
Say by tha end of tha night you will be chillen' with tha click
Flossin' it, money we tossin' it
'Cause we a tha Boss in it
We naw ease up...We ain't stallin', grab the girls all in
That's my true callin'
Ya'll freeze up.. We be flowin' it,
Your girl knowin' it And that's why she's showin' it.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Over here the liquor is light blue, the chronic is light green
They wearin' the right shoe, they put on the tight jeans
They bringin' me right through', I walk with a slight lean
My style excites you, I know what that might mean
Aye, I'ma freaky scorpio
Yo, tryna' leave with your skio
Aye, but its mandatory tho'
Yo' after me let shorey go

But that's another story tho'
But please don't try to bring us to the Maury show
How cool is he?
You don't know a fool who be crazy enough to fool with me
You'd rather swim in a pool of pee
Then see the one you love in the vehicle with me
Aye
Yo
But the vibe is right, the girls is up to par
We gon', drink it tonight and earl it up tomorrow

Sean Paul,"Going back to the memories
Reminiscing bout you and me
Thinking how it used to be
It's plain and clear I treated you bad
But girl you know that I care
Every relation have wear and tear
Just draw near girl and try to hear and listen what my heart says

Many days and many nights
Many heartbreaks, many fights
Many wrongs but so many rights
So girl don't let this love die
Never meant to cause you no pain,
Girl I never meant to treat you lame.
Gimme one more chance rewind come back again.
Don't let this love die.

Just cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

Can you feel me reaching out to you girl, can you hear my open thoughts
Never want disrespect you girl don't let this come break us apart.
'Cause I know I would die without you, my girl can you hear my broken heart.
It's calling out to the good times that we had back at the start.

Baby (Don't call me baby)
You know I need you in my life daily (You know you played me)
I was a player but now your love changed me (Dead wrong)
I'm going crazy (I'm gone)
Never thought losing you would be so hard

It's your turn to cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

So let go
And move on
What we were
Is now undone
My tears have all dried
It's your turn now to cry

You're losing your love and your trust for me girl
And you know, I would go to the ends of the world.
If you wanted, just like we started.
Girl 'cause I don't want to fight no more.
Make it like it was before.

I tell you the truth and you cried and I cried
Let's get back to the place and that look in your eyes
Can you feel it inside, no clouds in your skies
The sun is gonna shine

Chat to her Santana

It's your turn to cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

Cry baby, cry (New beginning)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

And rises to the sky

I'm from the city of the wickedest, cut throat connivers
We keeps it gutter, till the day that we die
We roam the streets at dark, all we got to survive
Is our hands and our heart, our balls and our word
Just for sitting in my hood, I be screaming until I'm horse
You ever touch one of mine, I'm coming for you and yours
If you ain't got to jack in the murder, you ain't shit
When you hear the blacka-blacka, you know somebody got hit
Hope it ain't none of mine, and if it's mine
I be coming to get you die trying, survival of the fittest
We the sickest no disrespect, but these boys got heart
It could be the dope, but these boys play the part
Murder capital, just a couple years back
In my city, itching to put us right back on the map
When you hear the click-clack, you know it's time to smash
Playa in chest-tolic, catch a bullet in the ass

I still hustled the block, I keep on cock the 17 shots
I'm a 9th Ward nigga, so I can't be stopped
Fill a X fill a boy, whatever get us high
With money on my mind, so somebody bound to die
Be careful what you say, cause if my people feel played
You bound to get sprayed, hole in your fade
I'm in between your braids, we love cracking domes
We love car jacking, and breaking in people homes
Love concealing weapons, illegal firearms
I'm a felon, ain't no papers on this pistol in my palm
Suicidal, murder mo' common than crawfish
Nigga die, we second line ain't that a (bi-ay-itch)

And let you walk around
Smoke a Latin blunt with ya
Then its going down
Watch me do my thing
You fucking with Sean Paul

And throw her up against the wall
Yeah you the shit
Ya matching panties with ya bra

But shorty goin' take it off
Shorty what it called

Although you're not mine from time to time, 
I've got to let you know you are my sunshine, my sunshine.

You drive me crazy 'cause yu fi gi mi dat bly, 
You make me high! I just can't deny, 
Love out potential a fill up inna I and I, 
Just give me the privilege and run a way yu man,

Sometime I think I hear you but I am hearing wrong, girl.

Automatic wide-screen
Lowrider, with them buggy-eyed beams
A bad freak, in the back seat, named Ming Ling
Last week, them bad streets, was in full swing
For my brothers locked down in G.P. to Sing Sing
Sean Paul, dancehall king
The track like a puppet on a string

From a set a dem any time dem come arouna
Dem hole a dis dem a waan try fi take ya crowna

Escape an a bed to Barcelona with Fiona and Iona
Floakin wit a pound of home growna

One a pour a club soda, plus I like di flight controla

That they've never felt before, c'mon

From ghetto to ghetto, to backyard to yard
I sell it whip on whip, it's off the hard

Only big boys keep deuces on the ride
Gucci Chuck Taylor with the dragon on the side

I'm trying to show y'all who the fuck I am

And you can tell by how my bread stack up
And disguised in this rap so the Feds back up

Doing a buck-six with me in the cockpit
Grindin' cousin, I got hoes for a dozen
Even Eleven-5, if I see ya keep it comin'
And my weight, that's just as heavy as my name
So much dough, I can't swear I won't change
Excuse me if my wealth got me full of myself
Cocky, something that I just can't help

Glock with two tips, whoever gets in the way
Not to mention the hideaway that rests by the lake
Consider my raw demeanor the icing on the cake, I'm Grinding

Balance weight through the hood

Part two--it's so crazy right now

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)

When I talk to my friends so quietly
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

You're the kinda girl that has a little bit more fun
I'm literally yours hun
Cause' I never seen a ass so big with a waist as little as yours hun
And by the expressions on them hotties grills
I know they want to holla at somebody real
And I'm usually lookin' for somebody skilled
Enough to make a nigga say aye aye aye yo niggas get mad 'cause I may slay they hoe
But I don't want to let the a.k. spray so
Stop face fightin' me, like ya face frighten' me
I do this every year so I ain't never scared
I do this everywhere and you ain't never there
They sayin' this everywhere, how could you never hear

If you want to roll with the thugs tonight
Lights, camera, action can you feel the hype
Hit cruise control blazed Kryptonite

Reminiscing bout you and me
Thinking how it used to be
It's plain and clear I treated you bad
But girl you know that I care
Every relation have wear and tear
Just draw near girl and try to hear and listen what my heart says

Many days and many nights
Many heartbreaks, many fights
Many wrongs but so many rights
So girl don't let this love die
Never meant to cause you no pain,
Girl I never meant to treat you lame.
Gimme one more chance rewind come back again.
Don't let this love die.

Just cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

Can you feel me reaching out to you girl, can you hear my open thoughts
Never want disrespect you girl don't let this come break us apart.
'Cause I know I would die without you, my girl can you hear my broken heart.
It's calling out to the good times that we had back at the start.

Baby (Don't call me baby)
You know I need you in my life daily (You know you played me)
I was a player but now your love changed me (Dead wrong)
I'm going crazy (I'm gone)
Never thought losing you would be so hard

It's your turn to cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

So let go
And move on
What we were
Is now undone
My tears have all dried
It's your turn now to cry

You're losing your love and your trust for me girl
And you know, I would go to the ends of the world.
If you wanted, just like we started.
Girl 'cause I don't want to fight no more.
Make it like it was before.

I tell you the truth and you cried and I cried
Let's get back to the place and that look in your eyes
Can you feel it inside, no clouds in your skies
The sun is gonna shine

Reminiscing bout you and me
Thinking how it used to be
It's plain and clear I treated you bad
But girl you know that I care
Every relation have wear and tear
Just draw near girl and try to hear and listen what my heart says

Many days and many nights
Many heartbreaks, many fights
Many wrongs but so many rights
So girl don't let this love die
Never meant to cause you no pain,
Girl I never meant to treat you lame.
Gimme one more chance rewind come back again.
Don't let this love die.

Just cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

Can you feel me reaching out to you girl, can you hear my open thoughts
Never want disrespect you girl don't let this come break us apart.
'Cause I know I would die without you, my girl can you hear my broken heart.
It's calling out to the good times that we had back at the start.

Baby (Don't call me baby)
You know I need you in my life daily (You know you played me)
I was a player but now your love changed me (Dead wrong)
I'm going crazy (I'm gone)
Never thought losing you would be so hard

It's your turn to cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

So let go
And move on
What we were
Is now undone
My tears have all dried
It's your turn now to cry

You're losing your love and your trust for me girl
And you know, I would go to the ends of the world.
If you wanted, just like we started.
Girl 'cause I don't want to fight no more.
Make it like it was before.

I tell you the truth and you cried and I cried
Let's get back to the place and that look in your eyes
Can you feel it inside, no clouds in your skies
The sun is gonna shine

Chat to her Santana

It's your turn to cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

Cry baby, cry (New beginning)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

Cry baby, cry
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines",Cry Baby Cry [*],2005

That girl is a bad girl, yeah

Oh yeah that's her the big dog tryin' to get her little kitty to purr
Ex-man lookin' at me like I'm Lucifer
Cause he knows I will deal with his case yes sir!
If I was the last man I earth 
I would only take that girl end of search
She give a new definition to the word curve
Got chicks in the strip club envyin' her
Body's like weapon, a mass irruptions
See the glad on that phat obstruction
Tongue game give a new type of seduction

Girl I can't notice but to, notice you, noticing me, 
From across the room I can see it and can't 
Stop myself from looking and noticing you, noticing me
Watch out I've seen her type before
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl, I've seen her type before
She's so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous,
That girl is a bad girl, yeah

Oh, bad to the bone, everything locked like a two three zone
I wanted to make my black snake moan
Talk a little bit and take that home
She bad and she know the deal
That's what I can't hide when she want to conceal
I mean Megan Good and Halle Berry put together 
Ain't close to the jubee I see
No no, no disrespect but this gyal a pon another level,
Cut the check, uh
Tell king, max stop the press, say kid can I get a witness

Girl I can't notice but to, notice you, noticing me, 
From across the room I can see it and can't 
Stop myself from looking and noticing you, noticing me
Watch out I've seen her type before
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl, I've seen her type before
She's so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous,
That girl is a bad girl, yeah

I see you got that fire by the way that you walkin'
From left to right I watched her go down
Girl I just want it right now don't wanna do no talkin'
Shortys so right I need to slow down

Figure eight, good body shape
When she on the dance floor, gyal dem irrate
When she do her thing man can't walk straight
That biscuit soak up everything in my plate
Bad heels like Jessica Pete
I'm tryna give home girl sex and the city-tity
Itty bitty waistline moves with the baseline
One lick of punch, I'm fine

Girl I can't notice but to, notice you, noticing me, 
From across the room I can see it and can't 
Stop myself from looking and noticing you, noticing me
Watch out I've seen her type before
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl, I've seen her type before
She's so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous,
That girl is a bad girl, yeah",Dangerous,2008
