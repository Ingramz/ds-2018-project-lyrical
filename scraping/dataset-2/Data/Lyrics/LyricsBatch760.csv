No one was givin us nuttin so we resorted to gunnin
Growin up and we comin, up the ladder not bummin
Dodgin warrants and summons, from the cops we were runnin
Goin to school not for nuttin they teachin lies and assumptions
And they tell us keep comin, comin to school now for what? When
Comin back to a system that's whack and really not runnin

You caught up in the image and, don't know they rhymes
You caught up in they bodies and don't know they minds
So I'm, here to bring the truth in the place
Like don't think Common won't punch you in your face~!
And don't think Talib won't hold the heat
To stop the violence you gotta know your street
You gotta know who Tanga Reed is

N.A.S.A.,"From the drop of blood, to bones and body parts
To vital organs, forming your brain and tiny heart
The fetus, date of birth; until puberty finally starts
Adolescence, adult, then your elderly body rots
It was divine decree that begun the plan
But is diseased by the greed of the sons of man
Don't try to leave with the guns in hand
Understand: God's the one in command

Did we climb out of the sea?
Where did we come from, you and me?
Two legs to walk, and as you see
I'm not a man I want to be
People growing, my backyard (I'm growing in your backyard)
In my garden, in my heart (I'm in your garden, I'm in your heart)
Pink and purple, red and blue (See all the colors?)
On this sunny afternoon (It's a sunny afternoon)

Back before time was time and space was space
The ever-present eye divine so laced with grace
Decided it was time to try to chase, to chase
But what it would design, now life is taking place
Within itself, divided; now it takes some space
And it can't be found alive, the mind creates the state
Of ego, now what's mine is mine
OK, now hate will reign until the blind have eyes and lay awake in wait

How are the seeds in the ground?
How is my garden growing now?
A tender kiss, a little smile
The way a mother holds its child
Tasty little human beings (Tasty little human beings)
I grow them on the people tree (I grow them on the people tree)
I will eat them one by one (Eat them one by one)
If there's enough for everyone (Like you and you)

Born in the ever-flowing life beyond the dirt
Tell me what the purpose is for creating the earth
(Maybe we created the planet as man's habitat
Be fruitful and multiply across the planet's back)
Well, why does hate exist?
The war and AIDS and shit?
If we're to be fruitful, why can't poor people pay they rent?
('Cause love and hate, both sides are conjoined
Physical forms have to deal with both sides of the coin)
Why do we die? (So you can live!)
Why do we strive? (So you can win!
But why did you defy every truthful word I recommend?)
My question back, why do you recommend an ode temptationing
(So I can test your patience and tolerance in the face of sin)
But why attest when you hold all the answers to the state we in?
(For you to bear witness of imperfections of mortal men)
So it's a lesson? (And a blessing
Journey back to where you been
'Cause before the tree can flourish seeds must first be planted in)

I saw the hippies cross.
By Herc on Technique needles syncopated time was on time,
The same time as the Beatles.
I was up there watching James Brown's pockets, stuffed withJolly
Ranchers.
when the NFL had the Rams in Los Angeles,
Charles Finley in Oakland,
And my kindergarten moment was the beginning.
'Til the Caribbean people came to New York and sheepskin
was bought,
The wind breaker

The building never fall down.
They are the teeth of the town (spacious thoughts)
they crush us up in they grind,
The meat and bone of the mind.
We gather here on the block (spacious thoughts)
They key broke off in the lock.
I'll meet you down by the well
I'll meet you down by the well (spacious thoughts)

The balloon drops down at midnight
Stranglin' the monkey with the hands of a clock
Good can't help but do a little evil
Evil can't help but,
do a little Good.
Who's that singing in the kitchen by the stove?
All aboard for the night train!
They say the moon, it smells just like a cherry bomb.
Come on home,
All is forgiven.
Everything costs.
Deliver us from evil,
And carry your own cross.

[Chorus]
The building never fall down.
They are the teeth of the town (spacious thoughts)
they crush us up in they grind,
The meat and bone of the mind.
We gather here on the block (spacious thoughts)
They key broke off in the lock.
I'll meet you down by the well
I'll meet you down by the well (spacious thoughts)

The time gathered with poppy seeds and grass,
Growing nobody faster than Jesse Owens.
With everything I'm seeing and knowing.
London Heathrow,
Walking through the airport with green Pro-Keds
Sixty-niners from the designers,
Tom McCann above the hill,
Next to my man, Lou Man,
The cardigan sweaters,
The still sell the New Eras now at Jew Man!
Bridge cont.(Tom Waits)
Ghetto Bhudda in the second set,
Breaking out in a cold sweat.
I'll meet you in the music.
We meet in the music,
those we never met.
Keep dancing like there's nobody watching
Everyone can win the toss.
I may wander, bit I am never lost.

Years of love, tears of blood
You was up the club, like beers and drugs
Now I'm trapped in limbo with your golden fist symbol
See the soul?
Use my eyes for a window
Only death, I can escape from this loneliness
The assault of your love is felonious
It was the kiss that broke my narcissist
Still, I roam this earth, like the Prince of Darkness

Straightening her stockings
Her hair

Yesterday I tied two rocks together
That symbolize our lives
And threw them in the ocean
Now they're on the ocean floor coastin'
'Til they stop rollin' so far
That no sonar would list them
To the point that no one would even believe that we existed
I know that may sound twisted
But my neglect is killin' me
I feel so guilty
Please have faith in if you feel me

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Though you're probably feelin' blue
And you'll do what you must do
I hope you know
I'd hand the skies to you
I'm so embarrassed for mankind
They have the nerve to let their weapon shine
They're so stupid
Do they not know you're about to fly high
Away
With the wings that god will give you someday
I'm not jealous
I just can't take it

The beat just like a metronome
Can't breathe my heart is gone
Now what the fuck just happened

Keith Murray flips the undergroup cut dope funk flow chromotose
So listen close
I'm like the undertaker turning rappers into ghosts
Host and roast MC's like I'm suppose
I can send L.O.D. to bust caps perhaps
Bring E and Red and we can kick some raps
This track is so sickenin' and bouncin'
Make you nod your head so much you need counciling
I flow to a rough kind of mode
Competition run for cover cause I'm droppin' loads
No brainer crossing over in the Range Rover
Insainer pack heat like a super nova
Keith Murray gets it on and poppin'
Shut it down like administrative lockin'
Marble face poetry poverty hard
Perform like the ?
We went from allies to enemies
Stingin' like centipedes
Sit around and watch death come in threes
I burn like lye
Gruesome like Faces Of Death parts 1,2,3,4 and 5

I'm a leader without affair
Soldier without a past
Come around here frontin' and we gonna splash your ass
And you feelin' me you drillin' me with maximum intensity
Intentionally that's how it's suppose to be
Spectacular monster rap or slasher
At the nightfall I'm after ya like Blackula
I rap with a Blackenstein frame of mind
Aircraft fly when I use to push my braids to the side
Slide from Keith Jekyle to Murray Hyde
My battle cry make niggas wanna just lay down and die
It's imparitive that you feel the heritage I provide
Comin' courtesy but with no Jive

I make you give it all you got don't stop for a breather

You can't make me or break me but hate me greatly
Call me on my birthday to try to aggrivate me
Cause when I rock I got all the girls with me
Got niggas bouncin' off the wall like spider monkey
Bury the hatchet in the back of anybody tryin' to match it
It's the vulture new fulture gonna scratch it while you catch it

Jumping over borders
Ain't no ruler for restriction

Ain't no summons for our sons
Ain't no dealings for our daughters
Every prosecution hung, save the verdict for the lawyers
Illuminate the corn, I celebrate humanity and scream back at me in the morning
Every field in Mississippi, every street in California
Know the devil is alive, this the time to be anointed
Trackin' down a stream, that's connected to a dream
Head bussin', it ain't nothin', even if I gotta bleed
Sitting waiting patient for a universal pain
Politicking with the nation, this is as big as you and me
I'll let you find my contacts, okay

So hey, you, you wanna marry us?
Prayers, the cross, they carry us
I wanna get out 'cause I'm curious

Niggaz ain't got love for the jakes; do whatever it takes
Climbin down terraces, and the fire escapes
Yo we move money, money move me
Yo I'm usually, livin it up (livin it up nigga what?)
Gettin my dick sucked
Bone a bitch in the butt, make her say what-what

[Prodigy]
Now gun talk, do you speak the same language?
For your sake, I hope so, let's rap a taste yo
My shit spit like a retard, and plus boss
I drool for the day me and you could face-off
It gets gangster, when my clique step in the room
We blow torches, and celebrate good fortune
This is for my dunns who rest in coffins
I wish why'all was, wish why'all was here

[Chorus]

[Noreaga]
Yo what the deally P? Iraq, can buy out Q.B.
And you know we smash the industry, negatively
So fuck a good boy, I always been a foul hood boy
Yo as a youth I had ring-worms, and all that shit
A lil' dirt ball nigga, throwin dirt at ya clique
Cause me an Aknel nigga ain't packed no bags
We rather, be in the streets, sellin yellow mesc' tabs
Cause where we from, muh'fucker yo the game don't stops
Or we was, out thuggin yo we had chicken-pox
Me Mus', Maze, Outlaw, +Final Chapter+ brigades
It definitely get real, on stage
I ain't the Madd Rapper, but I'm mad at rap niggaz
They're sellin records yo, actin like they clap niggaz
Cause me and P. get money like L.S.G.
While them cats small change like a E.S.3.
Yo I'm still the same cat, that I used to be
Often, I'm on tour with my rosaries
Coastin, always hit 'em with the thug potion
Look at you now, now you just full emotion
Prankster height, my peoples like the gangster-type
Queens niggaz like to shoot, ain't afraid to fight
While why'all niggaz wear Pampers like the cradle type
Mainly hype, thugged-out, shined with light

Quit at 16 or throw in extra bars just for the non-believers 
I show them why its so hard to reach us

Puff heavenly, see me at 6'1"" weigh a buck 70 
Catch me in spots y'all niggas never be 
Packed in like green bay

Pump the shotty guagin, hit the shorty while he potty training 
I ain't playing, I'm truly the worst 
Simply the first to get his whole body fully reversed 
Uzi it hurts, leave you double-dead 
I'ma a bubble-head, I never listen to nothing my mother said 
Ay yo I hold niggas ransom for money 
Like Johnny handsome 
Been sonning niggas for so long 
I think I got a grandson 
My passion is money, a stash and a honey 
That won't ask questions but will blast anybody 
That's my kind of girl, kinda of world I want to live in 
Not a cell or a prison or in hell's armageddon 
Just a little ghetto 
Where my niggas control the middle 
We know the riddles of life where others know only a little 

Yo, yo been in rich places, sick places 
Seen my story on six thousand six hundred and sixty six pages 
Wages, I wrote six aces 
And at the same dice games, I caught six cases 
All over big faces, now it's tipped laces 
Ready to dig faces, but the bang it ain't 
Bitch spaces, niggas loading up they rib cages 
Cats like to rip places 
Bloody lip tastes, but the Cam is in big races? 
But I stay in import the pig places 
But the world know the girl though 
I fuck her off a furlough 
She'll be up, hook me up 
All your sales could be luck 
Only question for these ducks is 
Baby girl can we fuck 
You the type that need a wife 
Thought L-o-x told y'all the key to life 
Asshole, yo I don't play around 
I lay it down 
Fuck around, I spray around 
Flick a biscuit, nigga risk it 
My ass, you can kick or kiss it 

Ain't no niggas in the world more thorough than this 
(bust off) and sit the hot barrel dead on your lips 
Like 2 thirds of a brick (penaro and kiss) 
And kiss the crystal white fluffy part in the back of a whip 
See the plan is to stash all, and cash y'all 
The weed so strong, they gotta put it glass jars 
Niggas try to smoke me out, mope me out 
'cause the rims on my new joint be poking out 
I'm about to have no feelings 
Shit is deep, do they dance with the devil when they sleep 
I wake up gripping the air, wishing the hit 
Shit that they kick in ya ear 
When your soul be drifting in air 
My gift is half-rotten when I spit it tears 
That shit'll drop down my eye, I'm too tired to cry 
And I ain't never seen a nigga that too live to die 
They say you get what you ask for, so get it 'cause you asked for it 
If a nigga ain't a thief, then he better have the cash for it

I smoke bogeys, all day like 2-piddac (Smokin)
And smoke weed, and get drunk but no criddack
Guns go boom, the thing's jammed its like did-dat
Sounds like klit-at-klat-k-klat-klit-at
Still hold biddack, but really you need to sliddack (I know)
My team already diggin ya grave, (For what?) for ya niddap
And chicks love the dick, especially from the biddack
Have 'em sayin, Ohhhh NORE, and all th-that
Magnum XLs, but I mean its too thinnat
Oscar Lopez, it's revolutionary rizzap
The Lord gave me the willpower to bust Gizzat
This is my year, y'all niggas should hold bizzack

[Chorus x2]

Homey, open ya eyes and be alert when
The thing get to stutterin, and spittin, and squirtin
Holes in ya body by the time you pull ya heat out
Holes so big, man, ya heart and kidney leak out
I'm motivated by, cars and chains (Uhh)
And innovative ways (Uhh), to rock cocain (Uhh)

Gave it to Athena, came right back for shiggy though
Wasn't really though, I just signed a new deally-o
Makin more money, now this bitch is in my video
Idiot niggas, call them niggas o-idio
Now they makin collect calls like Arsenio

Look at me now, your only child breathing through you
For you, by you, the science of FUBU, ill creation
I'm still laying for that day I wake up
Out of this dream, see you kinetically move, a seventies jewel

A star's born, in the form of man, deep like Elijah

Now momma love said if I ever get rich

Rip some pieces of niggas, we got 'card with us

Something... (I'm yo' pusha), that they've never felt before
C'mon

From ghetto to ghetto, to backyard to yard
I sell it whip on whip, it's off the hard

Call me subwoofer, 'cause I pump ""base"" like that, Jack
On or off the track, I'm heavy 'cause
Ball 'til you fall cause you could duck to the fetti govs
Sorry my love, what I'm seeing through these eyes
Biz convoys with the wagon on the side
Only big boys keep deuces on the ride
Gucci Chuck Taylor with the dragon on the side
Man, I make a buck, why scram?
I'm trying to show why'all who the fuck I am
The jewels is flirting me, damned if I'm hurting
Legend in two games like I'm Pee Wee Kirkland
Platinum on the block with consistent hits

And you can tell by how my bread stack up
And disguised in this rap so the feds back up
Watch it, like my whip, like my chick, topless
Doing a buck-six with me in the cockpit
Grindin' cousin, I got pot for a dozen
Even eleven-5, if I see ya keep it comin'
And my weight, that's just as heavy as my name
So much dough, I can't swear I won't change
Excuse me if my wealth got me full of myself
Cocky, something that I just can't help
'Specially when them 20's is spinning like windmills
And the ice 32 below minus the wind chill
Filthy, the word that best defines me
I'm just grinding man, why'all nevermind me

N.O.R.E.,"Yo I grew up like the regular thug sold drugs 
Wasn't proud about it, but this is what I gotta do 
I copped the Jordan's, and the Fila's, too 
Yo, I loved the Bo Jackson's, the orange and blue 
Used to snatch Lee patches, now I wear Cartier glasses 
Thinkin' that the earth's axis, 
Revolves around my waist.. and how the fuck I feel 
Yo I played ball for Vince, yo I handled the pill 
Then it dawned on me, came strong on me 
I belonged with these, niggaz thuggin' with me 
So I switched crews, started rollin' with the older dudes 
Drinkin' brews, did what they say, and paid dues 
My hands dirty, trying to keep little Lea 
And got jerked, the first time I tried to re-up 
People my age, tried to say slow my speed up 
'Cause I smoked bogies, staked on weed up 

[Chorus]
I love my life (Love my life, yo) 
Sold drugs my life (Did it all in my time) 
Its my whole life (Live it up) 
I sacrificed (Sacrificed twice) 
This game we play (Play for keeps) 
I live and pray (Control the streets) 
Hear her say (Yo, just live your life, baby, live your life,baby) 
Ooo, yeah 

These is the days of sparkin', I used to roll with Rob Profit 
Troy Outlaw, Freddie Bedrock, and Joe Wood 
Runni'n in Timbo's ???, shine shoes 
Section Two, part of Iraq I grew up at 
Had to learn how to slapbox, instead of a gat 
I never knew rap, all I knew was crack 
Yo there's rules to this game, and people to blame 
When you see another little brother doing the same 
As you used to 
Growing up like you 
Palyin' skully, with his heat out, cellular phone 
Getting little drug money, but got the world sewn 
I recall, cause he gonna die 
Yo, I cry 
It's hard to, get tarred up with God jewel, part two 
Smily got shot up to (Rest in peace) 
Aiyyo, you realize that you miss a nigga (miss him) 
When you realize (realize) that you never gonna see him again 

[Chorus]

Aiyyo, its totally, up to the team, to me 
So don't, make a move if you don't ask me 
I'm, casually known, halfly blown 
In Miami, cause now Uncle Wise came home 
Jello, copped me a Role', copped them one, too 
You keep it real with a person, keep it real with you 
Use confidence, Thugged Out aimed for dominance 
Nostradam' in this, he slits wrists just like Glomerus 
??, Grenad', iced out for Tito 
Puerto Rico, we live life now cause we know 
The other side of the fence stay friendly 
Its just war in there, done, there ain't no Henny 
I can't live that, déjà vu, I did that 
I gained stats, rumblin' cats over Kit Kats 
Now I spit raps, park my Benz where the chicks at 
And just live with a big stack

N.O.R.E.,"We got that green stuff, Big Tite
Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in why'all face

I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

Too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

The audio, the mixed show, I still obtain
Queens legend, it's Nas and it's me
Anyone to disagree, I smack em out they misery
16 years, blood sweat in my tears
I wanna do a last report for everyone that cares
Or maybe I'm just anxious like a dude for a settlement
Maybe people don't think that seeing it is relevant
It's a uphill battle when you're still rich
And your first hit date back to '96
It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all
I heard Akh, I told em rep left rack y'all
He said wait a year or two, you ain't gotta press me
He gonna fuck hoes for free, and get a little sexy
Yea, he was right about that
And many years later, he's still writin' about that
'Cause I'm the left rack king, I don't care what you say to me
Say I don't make sense, cool, that's okay with me
Same niggas wanna hang all day with me
And DJ's gonna play what I play
And I can break down everything that I say
Sud a whole Muscata that I drink every day
And I be daydreamin in the nighttime

Life is beautiful, I cherish every breath of air
Disregard the past like I was never there
They shot a round with my style like I was Fred Astaire
Yea, Raris and Rovers, bitches love Mikey more than they love Sousa
Salute old boy, OG, soldier
Carrera shades on, Louis Vuitton loafers
Everything healthy, I stay fed
I hold toast, I ain't talkin' bout baked bread
Shake fast, no matter the odds we can make it
We been married to game, that's still newlyweds
Mili taming, 2-5 shit is sacred
I rock shades and my future look too bright
I rep the east, similar to true life
Shit on your crash tables, snake eyes, shoot dice
Supreme like Jennifer Griff, all I'm seeing is green
Dirty Sprite, codeine got me on lean
For my G's with they dreams on a triple beam
Freedom ain't free but the money gave me
Fuck yo swag, we supa fly

Beside an apple tree did grow
And there a boy once met his bride to be
Long long ago

The breezes joined in their sighs, the blossoms started to fall
And as they gently carressed, the lovers looked up to find
The branches of the two trees were intertwined,

How could you be so cruel

For you my heart is dying 
What do I have to do 
To prove my love is true

To mend this broken heart

Yella's on the drum roll, rocking the beat
Hey yo Dre, where are you gonna take this shit man

Hey yo, let's take it to the street (word up)
Let 'em understand perfection
Let knowledge be the tool for suckers to stop guessing
Cause I don't give a fuck about radio play
Observed the English I display
Lyrics for the adults, children have been barred
Scarred from listening to suckers so muthafuking hard
Dope, pumping that so much shit will never falter
Yo, It's Dre, so fuck the minor ?(minalta)?
Psycho like no other muthafuka, so
Step to me wrong, G-O for what you N-O
But be warn, never will I leave like a regular
Cause I'm a little better then the regular competitor
I use to see 'em on stage
Earning money like a thief but without a gauge
Until I got full of clocking the lane, getting pulled
(They said you was gonna get paid) no, that's bullshit
They like it stylistic
And I enchant the crowd like I'm a misfit
(C-see-see-C) see-see-see-cameras on flashing when I'm in action
A photo or fresh wit a flair for fashion
Pure simplicity, see it's elementary
To hear one of the hardest muthafukers this century
Try to comprise a word to the wise
And the guys, parental discretion is advised

Ren is most extremely high performance
The black hat 'cause I worn this 'cause it's like enormous
Some shit, I don't take it, not even in a toilet
And shit from a sucker, put in a pot and I'll boil it
Turn up the pilot as it burns
And maybe, the muthafukers will learn
I'm not a sub 'cause I speak sensible
Not consider a prince 'cause I'm a principal
I'm engineering the shit that you're hearing
Cause when it comes to power, I'm power steering
Silly you say, I say you silly when you're say it
Rushing to the eject to put my shit in and play it
It's like Apollo but I'm not an amateur
And I'm not giving a fuck while I'm damaging ya
It's for the record so Ren's lyrics, I'm gonna spin it
And if there was a trophy involved, I'll win it
Possession is mine and I'm the holder
Cause a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck 'cause I'm older
So for you to step off would be wise
And say fuck it, parental discretion is advised

I be what is known as a bandit
You gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it
Cause if you fail to see, read it in brail
Would it still be funky, so what's next is the flex
Of a genius, meander stutter stepping, if you seen this
Dope, you hope that I don't really mean this
But it play, making greater high top fade
It's not my trademark when I get loose in the dark
You guess it was a test of a different style
It's just another muthafuker on the pile
Driving your ass with the floor of your tongue
You hung yourself short, be after knowledge was brung
To your attention by the hardest muthafuking artist
That is know for lenching any sucker in a minute
Stagger 'em all
When I start flowing like Niagra Falls
Ice Cube is a quick to rip shit in a battle
Move like a snake when I'm mad and then my tail rattle
I get low on a flow so let your kids know
When I bust, parental discretion is a must

Little did they know that I would be arriving
And then surprising, rocking it from where I been
But it's the E here to take no mistake
To be made in a trade where funky ass records are being played
Fuck the regular, yo, I get better, the
Bitches want to trick and go stupid for the dick
So I get 'em hot thinking they're gonna get it
As they sit, rubbing their legs like a cricket
To you it may be funny
But there's no type of some beef without money
So slip the see-note and you can choke
On a wind ding ding-a-ling down your throat
Foreplay to me ain't shit
When you spread them, I'm ready, then you can get the dick
Of the Eaze, if you can deal wit the size
But if you can't, parental discretion's advise

N.W.A,"Yo man there's a lot of brothers out there 
Flaking and perpetrating but scared to kick reality

Man, you been doing all this dope producing
You ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is

So what you want me to do?
(Express yourself!)

I'm expressing with my full capabilities
And now I'm living in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight and meditate like a Buddhist
I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he said it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat, and it'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink, to my stomach
Cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to diss one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science, while I'm dropping English
Even if Yella, makes it a-capella
I still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage, nothing
But making a sucker and you equal
Don't be another sequel (Express yourself!)

Now, getting back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend; the records I spin
Again and again and again, yo, you're on the other end
Watch a brother blend dope rhymes, with no help
There's no fessing or guessing while I'm expressing myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless, is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes which fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto, and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when upon the microphone
Yeah, they want reality, but you will hear none
They'd rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs, and take a stand
But after the show, they go looking for the ""Dopeman""
Or they ban my group from the radio
Hear N.W.A. and say, ""Hell no!""
But you know it ain't all about wealth
As long as you make a note to (Express yourself!)

(Express yourself!)
(Go on and do it)
(Express yourself!)
(Express yourself!)
(Go on and do it)

(Express yourself!)  from the heart
Cause if you want to start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow, you ain't swift
Movin like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wessun for ya
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, getting physical
Doin' the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob!
Yes I'ma climb, but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growing just like a fetus
Or a tumor, but here is the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressing myself, Yella, slam it
Cause if I stay funky like this I'm doing damage
Or I'ma be too hyped, and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge, and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we're getting hyped tonight
Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just (Express yourself!)

A 100 Miles and Runnin'.
MC Ren, I hold the gun and
You want me to kill a motherfucker and it's done in.
Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct,
Is one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck.
Chances are usually not good
'Cause I freeze with my hands on a hot hood.
And gettin' jacked by the you-know-who.
When in a black and white the capacity is two.
We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers.
Now wearin' my dyes, 'cause I'm not stupid, motherfuckers.
They're out to take our heads for what we said in the past.
Point blank, They can kiss my black ass.
I didn't stutter when I said ""Fuck The Police"".
'Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace.
Now it's broken and can't be fixed.
'Cause police and little black niggers don't mix so
Now I'm creepin' through the fall.
Runnin' like a team. Well, see, I might have slayed y'all.
So for now pack the gun and
Hold it in the air.
'Cause MC Ren has a 100 Miles of Runnin'

""Into this news. Four fugitives are on the run.""
""FBI sources tell us that the four are headed""
""100 miles to their homebase, Compton.""

Lend me a mutherfuckin' ear.
So I can tell you why

Runnin' with my brothers, headed for the home base.
With a steady pace on the face that just we raced.
The road ahead goes on and on.
The shit is gettin' longer than the motherfuckin' marathon.
Runnin' on but never runnin' out.
Stayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out.
Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do.
But nobody's pickin' up a Nigga Witta Attitude.
Confused
Yo, but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose.
One of the few who's been accused and abused
Of the crime of poisonin' young minds.
But you don't know shit til you been in my shoes.
And Dre is back from the see-P-T.
Droppin' some shit that's D-O-P-E.
So fuck the P-O-L-I-C-E!
And any motherfucker that disagrees.
Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass.
'Cause I'm a nigga known for havin' a notorious past.
My mind was slick - my temper was too quick.
Now the FBI's all over my dick.

Got us tick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock.
That's when the E jumped off the startin' block.
A 100 Miles from home and ,yo, it's a long stretch.
A little sprintin' motherfucker that they won't catch.
Yeah, back to Compton again.
Yo, it's either that or the Federal pen.
'Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time.
Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my motherfuckin' mind.
Runnin' like I just don't care.
Compton's 50 miles but , yo, I'ma get there.
Archin' my back and on a straight rough.
Just like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the fuck out.
From city to city I'm a menace as I pass by.
Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm
A straight up nigga that's done in, gunnin' and comin'
Straight at yo ass.
A 100 Miles and Runnin'

This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton.
You're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you:
""Nowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide.""
Good luck brothers.

Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose.
Show me on the news but I hate to be abused.
I know it was a set-up.
So now I'm gonna get up.
Even if the FBI wants me to shut up.
But I've got 10 000 niggas strong.
They got everybody singin' my ""Fuck Tha Police"" song.
And while they treat my group like dirt,
Their whole fuckin' family is wearin' our T-shirts.
So I'ma run til I can't run no more.
'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score.
I got a urge to kick down doors.
At my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls.

Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'.
Dick-tricklin' at the sunny motherfucker's are ridin'.
Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it.
So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it.
The number's even, now I'm leavin'.
We're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in.
Her and the troops are right behind me.
But they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me.

One more mile to go through the dark streets.
Runnin' like a motherfucker on my own two feet.
But you know I never stumble or lag last.
I'm almost home so I better haul ass.
Tearin' up everything in sight.
It's a little crazy motherfucker dodging the searchlight.
Now all that chasing shit is done and
Four motherfuckers goin' crazy with
A 100 Miles of Runnin'!

Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

So I'm a hit you like this
Early in the morning hop into the Benz
I got 44 wayz of gettin' paid
Sittin' in my lap as I roll off the Compton blocks
To skoop up Ren I heard shots,
1 2 3, Then I see the nigga
Hop in the Benz and it was Ren on the motherfucking trigger
He got in the Benz and said
""Dre I was speakin' to de bitch O'shey""
And as we roll on I seen the patrol on crip
So we got ghost because they beat

I gotta have it if I'm not paid fully

Talkin' under your breath won't lead to young death
Fuckin' up shit and shit by the killin'
For a nigga labeled as bein' a motherfucking Villain
But you don't know me, a record can't tell ya
I was so afraid I'd be a motherfuckin' faliure
Real niggas got a hat-top breakin'
I hooked up with 3 more niggas and started makin' 
Funky-ass shit for your system
Might sound nice so it makes you wanna listen to a

If i'm not no nothin' I don't feel like
So I grab de 9 n' de clip and go to murder motherfuckers at night
Because I'm startin' to feel
I'm sittin' in a cell with a crimerz too tragic it couldn't make bail

Cause her son caught the slug.
Relate this to no choice
And listen to this straight-up man before they ban the voice
While I ride to the rhythm of a pop
Remember the first nigga that run is the first to get shot
Whoever said that what I say and betray is negativity
Need to come kick it in the city with me
And find the black and crack and fact
And take that shit back cuz they don't wanna fuck with that
There's too many niggas they're tryin' to calm
If motherfuckers could get it, nobody would've fuck with it
Appetite for destruction,
For him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit,
Murder in the first degree, a man slaughter
Takin' the life of his wife and young daughter
A whole city of bitches they look sucked up
And the niggas is killin' it's straight fucked up
Whoever sayin' what I'm sayings for greed
Then I ain't even what they're tryin' to feed my appetite for destruction

You guys know who I'm talkin' to

That Appetite is tremendous
So I'm gonna spin this
Try for some violence because they ax me to end this
Some trouble that I caught cause I was noisy
A nigga tried to take advantage because I'm the kamikaze
He took de swing from my hand, thought I was faded
Start runnin' for the door but the fucker never made it
The sound of the 9 went bang!
And all over the wall was his motherfucking brain
Cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on
So set the alarm, 'cause I hit like a motherfuckin' bomb
I do damage with a 9 in my hand
But the average nigga that don't know me don't understand
I'm from the streets so therefore
You know I don't care for
A sucker that ain't down with the real niggas the niggas the niggas yo
And that's the way this shit gotta go, and even so
But any time that the 9 wanna leave
I got a .38 hidden up the sleeve
And it's ready to go to war cause that's what it's here for
I shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more
And that's a million and one
That couldn't hang with the appetite
Cause they wasn't rappin' right
So I had to destroy whoever was standin' in my presence
For fuckin' up da essence appetite for destruction

White folks don't believe that shit, don't believe that cops degrade you,
Oh come on, those people, those people was resistin' arrest""

Check it out y'all, in the house y'all
So I can show and flow and let the people know
So won't you ease on down to the yellow brick road to Compton
But first let me tell you somethin',
I possess the 10 commandments of the Hip Hop Thugster,
Known as a thief and murderer
First one,
Alibi a nigga with an attitude
Gotta get respected, break your mothafuckin' neck
Second one,
Always gotta fuck outta wedlock
I like it when the pussy goes snap crackle and pop
Number three,
I'm a gangsta fanatic
I smoke any fools tryin' to cause some static
Number four,
Here's what's in store
A crazy-ass nigga that remains hard core
Fifth one,
My killings just begun
I pulled out my gun, now they keep me on the run
Step six,
It's kinda tricky,
Can't forget that I'm mothafuckin' chickenshit
To the ones who tries to play the E,
By the time you reach Seven you'll be 6 feet deep
Number eight,
Make no mistake,
Move real sneaky and you're bound to catch yo' pray
Ninth one,
I gotta be raw, fuck any brain-washing man made law
Last but not least, I must be real,
Number ten, is my appetite to kill",Appetite for Destruction,1991
N.W.A,"What you want is an unexpected approach,
That may delay a suspects awareness of your presence,
Until you have a chance to assist the situation you are confronted.

Approach to danger, don't move
It's hard to predict what will happen next.
(Oh shit, he has a gun!) drop the gun
You could've prevented a tragedy.

You can approach, but the danger-light is blinking,
A self-destruct button is activated when I'm thinking.
This is a tribulation, the weakened judge,
The prophecy was fulfilled cause I never budge.
I took up the tools, crucifixion was the extreme,
They're seeing doubles of me, but it wasn't a dream.
One vision was of life, the other was death,
Then I didn't give a fuck if death took your last breath.
So you burn in my pit that I call hell,
Where you got send because your shit don't sell.
My twenty-twenty was blurry from the smoke,
Of the niggaz that I burned and tormented but I didn't choke.
I started doing 'em, I kept on doing 'em,
Do 'em for shoot 'em up till that nigga Ren was booing 'em.
And my presence to the suckers was of a stranger,
But fuck it, they can approach to the danger.

If you can be seen, you can be hit.
If you can be hit, you can be killed.
(He's on the line! Shoot him!)

Fatal approach to danger, just to remain a strangler,
Outrun, the shot of a gun with a ganger.
Murder in the first degree, but it's worse to be,
A dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody.
With everybody thinking of death I kept working,
To be one of the last niggas left.

Without checking the fingerprints on the motherfuckers' throat.

Bodies like a nigga's straight walking in a cemetery,
So it's very necessary to carry ammunition for niggas wishing,
But they better take caution, before Dre goes off,
And starts killing motherfuckers,
Just in order to change the anger for the real nigga,
When I approach to danger

Approach the motherfucking danger,
Come back to hell and send me some time (this is it y'all)

Final approach to danger, death, destruction around every corner,
Another dead body and you want to keep running.
But even the rain turns black,
All you can do is stay alert to try to say out of the search-light.
No prison, nobody makes bail,
Everybody gotta go but see, it ain't no jail.
Think about death, taking your last breath,
Heart beating like a motherfucker like there ain't no time left.
For so many ways to stay up, I gotta get mine,
Even though they want to make a crime.
Yo, I'm being real, a better or latter in the beginning,
Because it will release the fucking police.

Now this is some shit that's from the Dayz of Wayback,
When niggas in Compton first started to jack.
When the bitches wouldn't give you no pussy if you wasn't sellin' drug,

They always loved that shit. They want a nigga that's sellin' Ks.
But nowadays they workin' at Mickey D's.
But in the Dayz of Wayback
I couldn't be laid back,
Because I needed ends and I made that.
I get the nine from my nigga that he lend me and
Start robbin' motherfuckers, just like cowboys and Indians.
Anything it took to get paid.
A nigga like Ren already had the plane made.
And I was in it to win it and not to lose.
And shit, it start blowin' up, once I lit the fuse.
And police couldn't touch me because I was payin' 'em.
But not with no money, yo, I was frayin' 'em.
And never get caught because nobody is snitch,
But one hoe did, so Ren had to shoot the bitch!
Now she's in a coffin and my life is better off and

Niggas stealin', motherfuckers willin' to dealin'.
With so many ways to come up
The average nigga didn't give a fuck
About another muthafucka in this game and
Claimin' what he claimin',
Livin' like he livin',
Killin' after killin'.
Murder was a dirty job. To rob a dead man
Was the best plan 'cause a dead man never ran.
But now your best friend is your worst friend.
Greed, cash the fee. Make a me more some of what you holdin'.
So now your shit is stolen
And you and your niggas start rollin'.
Yo, to get your shit back ain't a word of.
Muff? It's more murder, more murder, more murder.
They want to make you think that it's a crack thang,
Or a black thing
Or some niggas in a motherfuckin' gang,
But guns and money they go together like the Ku Klux Klan
A nigga brung up and strung up.
Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Rememberin' the days that's past me,
Yo, never givin' niggas a chance to rest.
The ghetto is like a fuckin' survival test.
And number one way for you to pass,
Yo, get treated like a king and they'll crown your ass.
They never in the wrong though,

He from a planet called: ""Punk!"" It is full of pussy protein and pearl tongue

All I wanna know is why y'all let his punk-ass in the group in the first place

N.W.A,"Why you brothers insist on usin' the word nigga?
Don't you know that's bringin down the black race?
Personally I think the lyrics are a bit too harsh
I ain't no nigga, fuck that shit
Does everything come out your mouth got to be a 4-letter word?
The way you talk about women is bullshit, plain bullshit
Motherfucker I got kids, I don't want 'em listenin' to that bullshit

Fuck the niggas!
Motherfuckers need to stop
How can you call yourself a nigga and be proud of it?

Flatline
Bullshit!

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Well it's because motherfuckers wanna blast me
And run me outta my neighborhood
And label me as a dope dealer yo, and say that I'm no good
But I gave out jobs so niggas wouldn't have to go out
Gave up some dope on the corner so they could show out
When the cops came, they gave a fake name
Because the life in the streets is just a head game
So therefore, to make more
A 15-year-old black kid'll go and rob a liquor store
And get shot in the process
He ate up a nine bullet and now he's put to rest

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
I guess it's just the way shit has to be
Back when I was young gettin' a job was murder
Fuck flippin' burgers, 'cause I deserve a
Nine-to-five I can be proud of, that I can speak loud of
And to help a nigga get out of
Yo! The concrete playground
But most motherfuckers only want you to stay down
But I'm a smart motherfucker you see
One of the best producers in the rap music industry
Gettin' paid like a motherfucker
A young brother, who don't give a fuck about another

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Because police always wanna harass me
Every time that I'm rollin' (rollin')
They swear up and down that the car was stolen (this shit is stolen)
Make me get face down in the street (in the street)
And throw the shit out my car on the concrete (yeah)
In front of a residence
A million white motherfuckers on my back like I shot the President

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Because my mouth is so motherfuckin' nasty
Bitch this, bitch that, nigga this, nigga that
In the mean while my pockets are gettin' fat
Gettin' paid to say this shit here
Makin' more in a week than a doctor makes in a year
So why not call myself a nigga?
It's better than pullin' the trigger and goin' up the river
And then I get called a nigga anyway
Broke as a motherfucker and locked away, so
So cut out all that bullshit
Yo! I guess I'll be a nigga for life

Niggas, crackers, Jews!
If there's hell below, we're all gonna go!

Nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga, please
I'm treated like a fuckin' disease
You say, why do I call myself a nigga so quick?
'Cause I can reach in my drawers and pull out a bigger dick, yo
Nigga say nigga we cool but
Cracker say nigga, nigga knocked the fuck up
But I gotta be a fast nigga, to never be the last nigga
Or I'll have to beat yo' ass, nigga
In the city you see action first
Then hear about it later in a verse I curse
Because I'm real with this to keep my shit straight bumpin'
Murder, created by the streets of Compton
Now get it from the underground poet
I live it, I see it, and I write it because I know it
And if you think I'm fuckin' your wife
You're motherfuckin' right yo, 'cause I'm a nigga for life

I love niggas, I love niggas, I love niggas
Because niggas are me
And I should only love that which is me
I love that you niggas (niggas for life)

Nigga this, nigga that
The actual fact is that I'm black and bound to attract
The attention of another, I mean the other
But I'm a motherfucker that'll have 'em runnin' for cover
You see, I don't give a fuck about nothin'
Except gettin' paid, gettin' bitches, and issuin' stitches
Which is, all needed to read it and find a rhyme
And then it's time to say, the nigga's here to stay
But what about the fake niggas, the house niggas
To get paid quick they gotta suck a fat dick
But N.W.A. is outta your motherfuckin' range
We ain't gonna change a motherfuckin' thang!

I call myself a nigga 'cause my skin won't lighten
I call myself a nigga 'cause the shit that I'm writin'
Hypes me, hypes other motherfuckers around me
And that's the reason why they wanna surround me
And ask me, why do I call myself a nigger-o?

She was gettin' G oh for a nut or two yo
I think her name was Clara
And she was guaranteed to give a motherfucker whatever he needs
To be perfectly honest she was a hooker
So I took her, a 100 yards, to the blvd
I told her ""I'll take care o' you, you take care o' me""
You've gott a P I M P and all I want is the money
She went to work and the niggas were fiendin' yo
She had the biggest ass that you ever seen
In fact she was like Medusa
Her tities fully grown
A look and your dick turns to stone yeah
Keepin' on mind that she was the kind that would find the time to get mine
Because she knows I'm not to be fucked with
She ain't crazy 
Fuckin' with Dre should be pushin' up daisies
She was the perfect ho' but what do you know
The bitch tried to gag me
So, I had to kill her
Yeah, straight hittin'
Now listen up and lemme tell you how I did it
Yo, I tied her to the bed
I was thinking the worst but yo I had to let my niggas fuck her first yeah
Loaded up the 44 yo
Then I straight smoked the ho'
'Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure
I was soft and she thank me 
Coughed to the boss and got tossed

She put her hicky on top of my dick
Sick Betsy, she told me she loved me
And she wanted to keep me
If only she can have the dick with me
I said I wanted but baby you gotta hold up
If I was happy with something that I could fold up
We can do this, she said her husband was rich
Then I knew I had the bitch
Yo She wrote a check name me a check
In the name of a bitch who was strugglin' at the same game
All I wanted to do was get P-A-I-D
Just a little somethin' for fuckin' me
Yo Everything was cool but Vikky concerned me
Her husband was the District Auterny
So, before he found out he was crossed up
'Bout his bitch I was fuckin' I had to tossed her
And put you slick, some nigga never forget
A dead bitch can't tell a nigga shit
One less bitch you gotta worry about
She's outta here and that's how it turned out

'Cause I said ""fuck it""
Loped and Choked and Smoked to the ho' like this :
""Bitch, it's all about Dre
 The money money money and this all I gotta say""
Of course she came with me
And remained with me
'Till the bitch felt lamed and ashamed to be
Workin' that trick shit
'Cause niggas knew that she was someone
A little later though she called 1
In the chest and I knew that it was commin'
By who and how the all act would be done?
So what?
One less bitch you gotta worry about
But that ain't how it turned out

Yo, there was a bitch named her out and shot her
Straight to the motherfucking trigger and said ""I got her!""
But I had better plans to give her the blues
Like dumpin' her in the river with sea net shoes
I knew my money was comin' up sho'
And the thought that the stupid bitch thought she'd never get cought
Came home early and straight bust her ass
On the couch with the other nigga countin' my cash
I should've known she was like the mother ho's
I told the 2 motherfuckers to take off their clothes
Butt naked nothin' left but the shoes
I had up a 9 so they couldn't refuse
I shot the nigga he was outa there
And tied the bitch to the Muthafuckin' chair

Wanna dress like, wanna sound like muthafuckin' style stealin'
Clone ass N.W.A bitin' ass motherfuckin' everywhere man

Non-reality livin' ass motherfuckers man
Hey, I don't know. Reality, it's important to me, man
So fellas man, tell these niggas what it's like in the minds of real niggas'

Prisoner like a hostage
Yo, you should of covered your muthafucking head like an ostrich
Deep in the dirt cause you's a sucker
And your ass up high so I can kick the muthafucker
Don't try to hang, you're best abroad
'Cause my foot will be so far up you ass, you're get hemorrhoids
Before you try to fuck wit Ren
I'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10

First come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve
Step up and get what you deserve
From the word of a muthafucking hip-hop maniac
Brainiac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back
But how the fuck you think a rapper last
Wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past
Yo, be original, your shit is sloppy
Get off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy

Falling deep in the drums so many of styles
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles
Cheating and out beating the crowd I kept seating
But weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating
Styles that kept them full of bull
'Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs
And not getting paid in full
They got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us

Yo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do
You don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you
You can't harm me, alarm me
Cause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army
The niggas wit attitudes if you didn't know
We blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo
Try us and take it
Yo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in

It's the real thing, you are now real, real niggas, niggas

You can run but you can't hide, you know I'm a find ya
'Cause a nigga like Ren's only 2 steps behind ya
Don't look back, because you're shaking and all scared
A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
So sleep wit the lights on, forget that the mic's on
Don't step on my muthafucking stage without Nikes on
Don't say it's psycho, and then you just might go
Mentally fucked up when I let the right blow

All these niggas wit the jibber jabber
But couldn't kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer
Gangstas in black are out there
But only because, yo, it's the shit we wear
On my muthafucking dick
But I'm a love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick
So, yo, step off, go to bed, 'cause if you're mislead
You get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead

Black, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see
A little streetwise nigga, you know me
Rolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps
But you muthafuckas know who run the streets
Wit that hardcore hip-hop rap shit
(Now how much harder can another nigga get?)
Trying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us
(Ashes to ashes and dust to dust)
So nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please
Since you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees
'Cause I'm a muthafucka that's out to kill
Eazy-E, a nigga that's real

Real niggas, straight off the streets of Compton
Quick to get in your shit without second thought
And if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught
So if you're talking shit about the niggas in black
Bow down to the King's and Raider's hats

They played out, that's what niggas were chanting
One nigga left and they said we ain't happening
People had thought we was finished and then done wit
But if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit
Yet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas
And when the new record come, I'll come like a fucking bomb
Asking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb
You're on the dicks of four niggas not one
And when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one
So brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up
Because if I let you slide, it's just cause you lucked up
Don't come in my face again, because I'm a floor ya
And if you're a bitch, I'm a fucking ignore ya
Because my attitude's a little bigga
'Cause MC Ren is one of the real niggas

Lost in a muthafucking world of madness
Sadness, but Dre is just a nigga that gladdest
Sucker muthafuckas like you, making whack jams
Because it only shows you how dope I am
Never try to ignore us
When I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortise
'Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure
You can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger
Dre is just a nigga wit hard, a nigga that's smart
A nigga that's paid to say what others are scared to play
We started out wit too much cargo
So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold
Yo, NWA, criticize for what we say
But I'm a do the shit anyway
'Cause I'm the muthafucking doctor, never faking

accused and abused Of the crime of poisonin' young minds. But you don't know 
shit til you been in my shoes. And Dre is back from the c-p-t. Droppin' some 
shit that's d-o-p-e. So f**k the p-o-l-i-c-e! And any muther f**ker that 
disagrees. Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass. 'cause I'm a nigga known for 
havin' a notorious past. My mind was slick - my temper was too quick. Now the 
FBI's all over my dick.

Got us tick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock. That's 
when the e jumped off the startin' block. A 100 miles from home and, yo, it's a 
long stretch. A little sprintin' muther f**ker that they won't catch. Yeah, 
back to Compton again. Yo, it's either that or the federal pen. 'cause niggas 
been runnin' since beginning of time. Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my 
muther f**kin' mind. Runnin' like I just don't care. Compton's 50 miles but, 
yo, I'm ma get there. Archin my back and on a straight rough. Just like Carl 
Lewis I'm bailin' the f**k out. from city to city I'm a menace as I pass by. 
Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm A straight up nigga that's done 
in, gunnin' and comin' Straight at yo ass. A 100 miles and runnin' 
This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton.
You're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you: ""nowhere to run 
to, baby. Nowhere to hide."" Good luck brothers.

Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose.
Show me on the news but I hate to be abused.
I know it was a set-up.
So now I'm gonna get up.
Even if the FBI wants me to shut up.
But I've got 10 000 niggas strong.
They got everybody singin' my ""f**k tha police"" song.
And while they treat my group like dirt,
Their whole f**kin' family is wearin' our t-shirts.
So I'mma run til I can't run no more.
'cause it's time for mc ren to settle the score.
I got a urge to kick down doors.
At my grave like a slave even if the ren calls.

Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'.
Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherf**ker's are ridin'
Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it.
So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it.
The number's even - now I'm leavin'.
We're never getting' took by a bitch with a weave in.
Her and the troops are right behind me.
But they're so f**kin' stupid, they'll never find me.

One more mile to go through the dark streets.
Runnin' like a mutherf**ker on my own two feet.
But you know I never stumble or lag last.
I'm almost home so I better haul ass.
Tearin' up everything in sight.
It's a little crazy mutherf**ker dodging the searchlight.
Now that chase, the shit, is done and
Four mutherf**kers goin' crazy with
A 100 miles of runnin'
Stop! stop! stop! stop!
Surprise, niggas!",100 Miles and Runnin' [*],1991
N.W.A,"[Ice Cube, do you think you could give me some money to get
my hair done?] How short's your hair right now?
[Well you know I get it done every week, and I need my nails
done too] Look, I'ma tell you like this

I ain't the one, the one to get played like a pooh butt
See I'm from the street, so I know what's up
On these silly games that's played by the women
I'm only happy when I'm goin' up in 'em
But you know, I'm a menace to society
But girls in biker shorts are so fly to me
So I step to em, with aggression
Listen to the kid, and learn a lesson today
See they think we narrow minded
Cause they got a cute face, and big-behinded
So I walk over and say ""How ya doin?""
See I'm only down for screwin, but you know
Ya gotta play it off cool
Cause if they catch you slippin', you'll get schooled
And they'll get you for your money, son
Next thing you know you're gettin' their hair and they nails done
Fool, and they'll let you show em off
But when it comes to sex, they got a bad cough
Or a headache, it's all give and no take
Run out of money, and watch your heart break
They'll drop you like a bad habit
Cause a brother with money yo, they gotta have it
Messin' with me though, they gets none
You can't juice Ice Cube girl, cause I ain't the one

[Girl, you got to get these brothers for all the money
you can honey. Cause if they ain't got no money, they can't
do nothin for me but get out of my face]

[I know what you mean girl, it ain't nothin' right jumpin' off
unless he got dollars]

Sometimes I used to wonder
How the hell an ugly dude get a fine girl's number
He's gettin' juiced for his ducats
I tell a girl in a minute yo, I drive a bucket
And won't think nuttin' of it
She can ride or walk, either leave it or love it
I show her that I'm not the O, the N-E, say
I'm a ruthless N-I double-G A
Cause I'm gamin on a female that's gamin on me
You know I spell girl with a be
A brother like me is only out for one thing
I think with my ding-a-ling, but I won't bring no
Flowers to your doorstep, when we goin' out
Cause you'll take it for granted, no doubt
And after the date, I'ma want to do the wild thing
You want lobster huh? I'm thinking Burger King
And when I take you, you get frustrated
You can't juice Ice Cube and you hate it
But you see, I don't go nuts
Over girls like you with the BIG ol butts
It start comin' out the pocket, to knock it
But when the damage is done
You can only lay me girl, you can't play me girl
For the simple fact that, I ain't the one

[I don't care how they look if they got money
we can hook up but they ain't gettin none.]

[Yeah I just make em think they gonna get some
play up they mind a lil bit, and get that money.]


Give you money why bother
Cause you know I'm lookin' nothin' like your father
Girl, I can't be played or ganked
Ganked means getting took for your bank
Or your gold or your money or something
Nine times outta ten, she's giving up nothing
They get mad when I put it in perspective
But let's see if my knowledge is effective
To the brothas man they robbing you blind
Cause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind
Keep your money to yourself homie
And if you got enough game
You'll get her name and her number
Without going under
You can't leave em and love and stay above em
I used to get no play now she stay behind me
Cause I said I had a Benz 190
But I lied and played the one
Just to get some now she feels dumb
To my homies it's funny
But that's what you get trying to play me for my money
Now don't you feel used
But I don't give hoot, huh, because I knock boots
You shouldn't be, so damn material
And try to milk Ice Cube like cereal
Now how many times do I have to say it
Cause if I have to go get a gun
You girls will learn I don't burn
You think I'm a sucka, but I ain't the one

I don't see no rings on this finger
Yeah you love my money, I got what I wanted, beat it",I Ain't tha 1,1994
N.W.A,"Yo man there's a lot of brothers out there
Flaking and perpetrating but scared to kick reality

Man, you been doing all this dope producing
You ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is

So what you want me to do?
(Express yourself!)

I'm expressing with my full capabilities
And now I'm living in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight and meditate like a Buddhist
I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he said it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat, and it'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink, to my stomach
Cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to diss one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science, while I'm dropping English
Even if Yella, makes it a-capella
I still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage, nothing
But making a sucker and you equal
Don't be another sequel (Express yourself!)

(Express yourself!)
(Go on and do it)
(Express yourself!)
(Express yourself!)
(Go on and do it)

Now, getting back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend; the records I spin
Again and again and again, yo, you're on the other end
Watch a brother blend dope rhymes, with no help
There's no fessing or guessing while I'm expressing myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless, is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes which fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto, and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when upon the microphone
Yeah, they want reality, but you will hear none
They'd rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs, and take a stand
But after the show, they go looking for the ""Dopeman""
Or they ban my group from the radio
Hear N.W.A. and say, ""Hell no!""
But you know it ain't all about wealth
As long as you make a note to (Express yourself!)

(Express yourself!)
(Go on and do it)
(Express yourself!)
(Express yourself!)
(Go on and do it)

(Express yourself!)  from the heart
Cause if you want to start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow, you ain't swift
Movin like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wessun for ya
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, getting physical
Doin' the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob!
Yes I'ma climb, but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growing just like a fetus
Or a tumor, but here is the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressing myself, Yella, slam it
Cause if I stay funky like this I'm doing damage
Or I'ma be too hyped, and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge, and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we're getting hyped tonight
Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just (Express yourself!)

In the case of N.W.A. vs. the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are: MC Ren, Ice Cube,
And Eazy motherfuckin E

Order, order, order
Ice Cube, take the motherfuckin stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothin but the truth so help your black ass?

You god damn right!

Well won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beatin' on, and thrown in jail
We can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see, me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still gettin' swoll off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbin' his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showin' out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just cause I'm from, the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me!
Huh, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dyin' in L.A.
Yo Dre, I got somethin' to say

'Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up
Man, fuck this shit
Aight smart ass, I'm takin' your black ass to jail!

MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang, is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash box, for the so-called law
Wishin' Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashin' behind me
But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives em a hint, not to step in my path
For police, I'm sayin, ""Fuck you punk!""
Readin' my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pullin' out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-assed badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it punk, and I'm a fuck you up!
Make you think I'm a kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'm a smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole, that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential, to get bad as fuck
So I'm a turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin' out a police, would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say

Fuck the police
Fuck the police
Fuck the police
Fuck the Police

Yeah man, what you need?
Police, open now
Aww shit

But I didn't do shit
Man just shut the fuck up!

Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

I'm tired of the motherfuckin jackin
Sweatin my gang, while I'm chillin in the shack, and
Shinin the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe cause I blast
On a stupid-assed nigga when I'm playin with the trigger
Of any Uzi or an AK
'Cause the police always got somethin stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
'Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
A sucker in a uniform waitin to get shot
By me, or another nigga
And with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size ain't shit, he's from the old school fool)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin, keep lookin in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin off the 8, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm drivin off laughin this is what I'll say

Never shoulda been let out the penitentiary
Ice Cube would like ta say
That I'm a crazy mothafucka from around the way
Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out
Now I'm the mutha fucka that ya read about
Takin' a life or two that's what the hell I do
You don't like how I'm livin well fuck you!
This is a gang, and I'm in it
My man Dre'll fuck you up in a minute
With a right left, right left you toothless
And then you say goddamn they ruthless!
Everwhere we go they say [damn!]
N W A's fuckin' up tha program
And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no, we to busy sayin' yeah!
About drinkin' straight out the eight bottle
Do I look like a mutha fuckin role model?
To a kid lookin' up ta me
Life ain't nothin but bitches and money
Cause I'm tha type o' nigga that's built ta last
If ya fuck wit me I'll put a foot in ya ass
See I don't give a fuck cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'

Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality""
Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin
""Hopin you sophisticated motherfuckers hear what I have to say""

When me and my posse stepped in the house
All the punk-ass niggas start breakin out
Cause you know, they know whassup
So we started lookin for the bitches with the big butts
Like her, but she keep cryin
""I got a boyfriend"" Bitch stop lyin
Dumb-ass hooker ain't nuttin but a dyke
Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like
Walked over to em, and said, ""Whassup?""
The first nigga that I saw, hit em in the jaw
Ren started stompin em, and so did E
By that time got rushed by security
Out the door, but we don't quit
Ren said, ""Let's start some shit!""
I got a shotgun, and here's the plot
Takin niggas out with a flurry of buckshots
Boom boom boom, yeah I was gunnin
And then you look, all you see is niggas runnin
And fallin and yellin and pushin and screamin
And cussin, I stepped back, and I kept bustin
And then I realized it's time for me to go
So I stopped, jumped in the vehicle
It's like this, because of that who-ride
N.W.A. is wanted for a homicide
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
Fuck wit me, I'll put my foot in your ass
See I don't give a fuck, cause I keep bailin
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin?

Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality""
Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin
""Hopin you sophisticated motherfuckers hear what I have to say""

""He'll tell you exactly how he feel, and don't want a fuckin thing back""

Homies all standin’ around, just hangin’
Some dope-dealin’, some gang-bangin’
We decide to roll and we deep
See a nigga on Dayton's and we creep
Real slow, and before you know
I had my shotgun pointed in the window
He got scared, and hit the gas
Right then, I knew I has to smoke his ass
He kept rollin’, I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to the fort
Sweatin’ all the bitches in the biker shorts
We didn't get no play, from the ladies
With six niggas in a car are you crazy?
She was scared, and it was showin’
We all said ""Fuck you bitch!"" and kept goin’
To the hood, and we was fin to
Find somethin’ else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
A bum rush, but we call it rat pack
On a nigga for nothin’ at all
Ice Cube'll go stupid when I'm full of eight ball
I might stumble, but still won't lose
Now I'm dressed in the county blues
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you Fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, cause I keep bailin’
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin’?

Here's a lil gangsta, short in size
A t-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
Built like a tank yet hard to hit
Ice Cube and Eazy E cold runnin shit

Well I'm Eazy E the one they're talkin about
Nigga tried to roll the dice and just crapped out
Police tried to roll, so it's time to go
I creeped away real slow and jumped in the six-fo'
Wit the ""Diamond in the back, sun-roof top""
Diggin the scene with the gangsta lean
Cause I'm the E, I don't slang or bang
I just smoke motherfuckers like it ain't no thang
And all you bitches, you know I'm talkin to you
""We want to fuck you Eazy!"" I want to fuck you too
Cause you see, I don't really take no shit
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you Fuck wit me, I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, cause I keep bailin
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin?

Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality""
Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin
""Hopin you sophisticated motherfuckers hear what I have to say""

Nigga living in cash selling to smokers 
That's the way goes that's the name of the game

Gold around his neck 14 k he has it 
Bitches on his dick 24-7 plus he's making
Money keeping the base heads waiting 
Rollin 6.4. wit the fresh ass daytons 
Living in Compton, California CA 
His Uzi up yo ass if he don't get paid 
Nigga begging for credit he's knocking out teeth 
Clocking much dollars on the 1st and 15th 
Big wad of money nothing less than a twenty 
Yo you want a five-oh the dope man gots plenty 
To be a dope man boy you must qualify 
Don't get high off your own supply 
From a kid to a G it's all about money

If you see some one getting money for crack he's

I'll slap you up side yo head wit 9 inches of limp dick 

You need a nigga with money so you get a dope man 
Juice that fool 4 has much as you can 
She likes his car and he gets wit her 
Got a black eye 'cause the dope man hit her 
Let that slide and you pay it no mind 
Find he's slapping you all the time 
That's OK cause he's rich and you ain't 
Nothing but the dope man's bitch do what he say and 
You keep yo mouth shut popping that trash 
Might get you fucked up you'll sit and cry 
If the dope man strikes you he don't give a fuck 
He gots t just like you 
There's a another girl in the dopeman's life 
Not quite a bitch but far from a wife 
She's called strawberry and everybody know 
Strawberry strawberry is the neighborhood hoe 
Do any thing for a hit are 2 give the bitch a rock 
And she will fuck your hole damn crew 
It might be yo wife and it might make you sick 
Come home and see her mouth on the dopeman's dick 
Strawberry just look around you'll see her 
But don't fuck around she'll give you gonorrhea 
If people out there ain't hip to the fact 
Strawberry is a girl selling pussy for crack

Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work
That crazy shit, yeah the stupid shit
Hey yo Eazy! (Yo!)
Hey man why don't you come off the piano for a minute
And bust this crazy shit

Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin' new shit by NWA
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this

Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

Down on B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is cut for doin the crime
For defense on the boy, he'll do some time

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork
""Disruption of the court"", said the judge
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out ""fire!"", then came Suzi
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder

We got my mella yella boy on the drums, We got Stan ""the Guitar Man""
Dropping the rhythm. We got LA Dre on the keyboard and I want the whole
Posse in this motherfucker to rock on this funky ass beat we're gonna drop
Alright, So Ice Cube, you the early bird on this motherfucker , run it

[Ice Cube]
Picture a nigga that's raw
Amplify his ass and what you see is what's on
Motherfuckers I slaughter, blow em out the water
Word to me, fuck the father
My melody is deadly as a pin in a hand grenade
5 seconds before you get played
You can't throw me, I guess you'll blow up
Ever see a sucker scatter, it'll make ya throw up
Then I take advantage, you can't manage
To get up, all you can do is sit up, I get lit up
Hit up, Ice Cube tearing shit up
Like a dude you can bet on
Collide like a head on
Collision, stutter stepping is an incision
Of a nigga saying exactly what I vision
Because I'm gone, you think I left you all
But I stay in yo' ass like cholesterol
When I blast some solid ass Alcatraz
And if you escape, you better swim fast
'Cause I'll catch ya, physically and mentally
And the capital punishment's the penalty
Sitting in the electric chair, grab a hold
Pull the switch, yo' body twitch, your eye's explode
Out your skull 'cause being dull on a flow
Is an N-O, niggas didn't know that I can go
Off and show off to throw off the law
Turn, take 10 paces then draw
What's left is a motherfucker dead in the alley
Ice Cube is the shit on the grand finale

[Dr. Dre]
Yea, yea that was funky but we need the motherfucking villian to speak
So kick it

[MC Ren]
The grand finale, yo, it's my turn to bust
So let weak motherfuckers turn to dust
If you're weak it ain't my fault
Just take a kick in the ass and get turn into a pillar of salt
And niggas that's biting just to taste me
I make the punk motherfuckers buckle up for safety
And on the dope they caught from the flash
And swing like a bit when he's caught in a whiplash
Giving him pain 'cause I'm urgent
Rearrange the motherfucking face like a surgeon
It ain't no excuse for the torture delivering
Don't say that I scare you, I can tell 'cause your shivering
Lyrics label wit an X and not a G
I say fuck the police, yo, so now they after me
I'm wanted by the law so I stay low
Representing the pimp, bitches making my dough
In a different stage, I must of went on a rampage
Me and the D.O.C. are always hitting the front page
For what, for stealing and stepping up to the sheriff
And when I enter the party, niggas shit in a (cell pimp)
For what, maybe 'cause I'm Ren
And when they clean up shit, yo, they do it again
So fuck it, sit back cool and relax
While Eazy busts the facts kicking the grande finale

[Dr. Dre]
Yea, y'all know what time it is. Easy motherfucking E is in the house doing
Damage

[Eazy E]
The name is Eazy for me to come off like the inforcer'
Mass murder motherfuckers in a course of
An everyday situation where I would stalk by
Fuck the car, I do a motherfucking walk-by
Eazy-E and the D.O. to the C. and
Run house and there won't be no disagreeing
'Cause if there is some, you feeling staticy
Then I'm arrested (For what) assault and battery
Never outdone, only outdoing
Loving the bitches and the hoes boo hooing
Why 'cause they're addicted to my dick
The pleasure of pain, the wing-ding and flipped it
(Yea) and never forget when done in bed by
Eazy, the name of a Compton hard head
Cool but local like loc never broke
'Cause they're paid to be Ruthless, this is why I do this
I don't give a fuck about fame
I rather deal wit a number than a motherfucking name (word)
Get me paid and then rap
'Cause all the other bullshit money ain't jack

If it makes you giggle, it must be kinda funny
But to me it's kinda cool (Tell 'em why), I'm making money
Tripping up the man wit the (swig tan) movement
Proving if you're grooving then it cool when he be doing it
Taking a second for me to blow your mind
'Cause I'm the diggy diggy D.O.C. and I would've been down wit rock
But I was smart, the D.O. to the C. now on the formula
It's rough, I mean it's funky enough for me
And you can have a listen after that and this and
D-O-N-'T M-O-V-E wit out permission
From the D.O. to the C., I'm just better than
The normal man and I'll be dumb if a sucker can
Ever compete wit the elite
Much less beat, it's like dancing wit 2 left feet
Never smile when the D.O.C. is in the room
Or I'm a send ya ass to the temple of doom
I got raw when I came to Cali
Now wit NWA on the motherfucking grand finale

Judge Dre presiding in the case of NWA versus the police department. 
Prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren Ice Cube and Eazy muthafuckin E. 
Order order order. Ice Cube take the muthafuckin stand. 
Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth 
and nothin but the truth so help your black ass? 

Why don't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say? 

Fuck tha police 
Comin' straight from the underground 
Young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown 
And not the other color so police think 
They have the authority to kill a minority 

Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't tha one 
For a punk muthafucka with a badge and a gun 
To be beatin' on, and throwin' in jail 
We could go toe to toe in the middle of a cell 

Fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager 
With a little bit of gold and a pager 
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product 
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics 

You'd rather see me in the pen 
Then me and Lorenzo rollin' in the Benzo 
Beat tha police outta shape 
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape 
To tape off the scene of the slaughter 
Still can't swallow bread and water 

I don't know if they fags or what 
Search a nigga down and grabbin' his nuts 
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none 
But don't let it be a black and a white one 
'Cause they slam ya down to the street top 
Black police showin' out for the white cop 

Ice Cube will swarm 
On any muthafucka in a blue uniform 
Just 'cause I'm from the CPT, punk police are afraid of me 
A young nigga on a warpath 
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath

N.Y. Alliance,"Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war, 
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear 
I guess he's better off than he was before, 
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here 
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because he was my only friend 
Those kind of cars don't pass you every day 
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because I wanted to see him again, 
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way... 

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad 
Sometimes I wish life was never ending, 
And all good things, they say, never last 

Springtime was always my favorite time of year, 
A time 4 lovers holding hands in the rain 
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears 
Always cry 4 love, never cry 4 pain 
He used 2 say so strong unafraid to die 
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized 
No, staring at his picture I realized 
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried 

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad 
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending, 
And all good things, they say, never last 

I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there 
I know that he has found another friend 
Maybe he's found the answer 2 all the April snow 
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again 

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad 
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending, 
But all good things, they say, never last 

All good things that say, never last 
And love, it isn't love until it's past",Sometimes It Snows in April,2008

Dick in hand, you shoulda had your toke down
A little city, chillin' in the North Bay
Needless to say, my boyz don't play fool
Yorker sidin' you know how the song goes
In the back, sippin' purple chongos
Don't look for trouble but it always seems to find us, forty
Grippin' panties, sippin', and the seats are right behind us
Quick left, one blow, K.O.
Hit the road to the next episode
In the saga of a few fellas
Oh what the hell, I guess i better tell ya
It's Friday night, I got a brand new kick on
A fifth of Henny, for me to get bent on
Hit the country club then picked up ML
Eighty west, back to the hotel

At the telly, Bones is doing butt work
Johnny Z had his hand up a miniskirt
The Latina in the corner started to flirt
And I knew that when she saw me baby doll was gonna jaw me
Set for the night so I took her to my ride
Grab my Mickey and my Buddha and I met her outside
Who-ride, brother striking through to be seen
A Lexus 400 to the triple gold Z's
Acid in my bottle, so I gotta get some more
Put the pedal to the metal back to the liquor store
Cause you know what i mean when I'm feelin' kinda funky
A sick honky, straight goin' donkey
Money in my sock, jimmy in the glove
Layin' in the Lexus, I'm about to make good love
And burn rubber up the block
Back to the telly, I gotta get some new cock
New cock (echoes)

Ah naw, could it be?
I just got a page an' a broad want to do me
Hooked it up, told her meet me at the hotel
She had a friend with her so i called TL
Soothe me up, Sally want to meet Dick
And Monty licked, so try an' make it real quick

(tick-tock)
(tick-tock)
(tick-tock)
(tick...Honk Honk)

Aw yeah, I jumped in the F-train
But wait a minute, we gotta hit the store man
I got to get some gum and some Tic-Tac's
Two tall cans and a packet of Blackjack's
We got the goods, now we're headin' for the ho down
There goes the telly, so fella won't you slow down
Park the ride in the front like a sick one
Just in case, we gotta bust a quick one
Lock the load, let's go look for like 118
But lay low cause I really don't want to be seen
Is this the room? Aw yeah, that's the right one
I got the black broad and you got the white one
So hit the lights man, I just might man
Try an' throw this thing all night an'
Get her so sprung, that she'll drop some ale
So I can catch turn and hit another hotel",Back to the Hotel,1992

They'll pay your for that donkey
If you know how to rap and get funky
But if yo shit don't sound good
I guess yo dick gotta stay on wood
But me (What's up?) I get mine (Ah-ha)
Check into the telly 'bout half past nine
And when I check out it's ten to two
My knees is week cause I got blew
So let me put you on my list
Of the dookie broads that I can't kiss
And next time that you see me
Bitch, don't even talk to me
Cause the only damn thing that you can do
Is hit the dirt and do my crew

Do the crew, do the crew

You want to get with me, you gotta do them too

Do them too
You gotta do them too
Do them too
That's right, hoe

[ VERSE 2: Jay Tee ]
Now let me put it like this
Baby, I ain't tryin to diss
But now I know who you are, so I don't think we can kiss
You look good, and maybe I might be wrong
But now I know where you been and the list is long
You been in motel, hotel, holiday inns
You been with most of my cousins and all my friends
And in a Benz way out in the Crest
Doin the wop, the crew thing and the strictly sess
Hard knob, baby, you're gettin raw, baby
And for a couple of bucks you give jaw, baby
So here's a ten spot, now hit your knees
Do me first and then do Tee
We'll bust that nut and we'll shake it off
Pull up our draws and we're takin off
Hit the gas and we're gone
But you ain't through
You gotta do my crew

[ VERSE 3: Jay Tee ]
Now even though you got switch, bitch, you ain't all that
I wouldn't give you the goods unless I had on a hat
Cause yo kitty cat has done some time
You been with every muthafucka who knows how to rhyme
So if you want to get with Jay Tee
Bitch, you gon' have to pay me
So kick me down just a few
And go and give my partners some dollars too
Cause yo, this ain't no solo creep
It's a package deal, N2Deep
20 steep brothers that are true and love to screw
But not tonight, hoe, we want to get blew
So do us up, and I mean well 
Don't even trip, hoe, we won't tell
That Michelle from Vallejo is cool
We gonna keep it to ourselves that you do the crew

Ah yeah
Check it out though
Now that I got everybody and they mama hooked up
I'm gon' let y'all handle it

Late one night when I was creepin
And the rest of the world was sleepin
I got a beep from a little freak I met
At the mall, yes y'all, she was gettin the call
So I called, said: What's up, what's the deal?
You booty looked real good today
You know I'm ready to lay
(Some pipe) yeah, the N2Deep type
She said: Cool, bring someone from the crew
I said okay, picked up [Name] on my way
I woulda got [Name] but he was with some hoe
So it's just me and the dog and we're ready to gee
We picked the girl up and it was plain to see
That she was down to spin around and all that
Parked the ride and we jumped in the back
Huh, we got did and did, man, you know what's up
Straight yak, she's a toss-up

Wake up, toss-up, you better call your boss up
Get up, wash up, dirty little toss-up
I'm in too deep and I'm still goin deeper
Not a straight peck redneck or a Crest creeper
Freak keeper, but only for a minute
Pull out ( ? ) 40 ounce and I'm up in it
Geein (Like that?) and I'm slingin thangs
Cause I'm pushin in Jimmy, then I'm pullin out James
10 gun salute to the man in the latex suit
(What's up?) This bud's for you
Straight dank man, goin up off 100 miles north of the V-Town

But they put the same metal in the bullets
And they put the same bullets in our backs
Kinda love that we got is one in a mill
Ain't no God that I pray to would wanna kill
It's not God but it's fear and it's politics
And a Molotov that was lit with a dollar bill
Don't say that all is lost
Escape this holocaust
My God, Allah, my darling, star and crescent and my cross

Sarajevo, Sarajevo
You're the altar that I pray to
God is love and love is all we have
Sarajevo, Sarajevo
I will honor and be faithful
God is love and love is all we have

Where do we come from? Where do we go?
You could fill up the sea with the things I don't know
But I know what I feel and I know when it's real
And I hope that we heal
We're two drops of the blood and tears
Over thousands of years of the clash of the steel
I'm not blind to the cycle
We’re pressed in spine of a Bible
They define the divine by the title
But what did Christ say? To be kind to my rival
You're my kind of revival
It's true ya, my favorite Hallelujah
You my you my favorite Hallelujah

Sarajevo, Sarajevo
You're the altar that I pray to
God is love and love is all we have",Sarajevo,2014
Nã Leo Pilimehana,"No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
I just called to say I love you

I opened up the paper to the page in the back.
It only took me a minute for my finger to find 
my daily dose of destiny under my sigh.
My eyes just about popped out-a my head. 
It said,""The starts are stacked against you, girl. Get back in bed.""
 
I feel lucky,
I feel lucky, Yeah.
No Professor Doom gonna stand in my way.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Well, I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk.
The pot's eleven million, so I called in sick to work.
I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito and a Barq's 
crossed against the light made a beeline for the park.
The sky began to thunder, the wind began to moan.
I heard a voice above me sayin', ""Girl, you'd better get back home.""
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky, yeah.
No tropical depression gonna steal my sun away.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Now Eleven million later, I was sittin' at the bar.
I bought the house a double, then the waitress a new car.
Dwight Yoakim's in the corner, try'n' to catch my eye.
Lyle Lovett's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh.
The moral of this story, it's simple but it's true:
Hey, the stars might lie, but the numbers never do.

But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

That's when she hear about me and her girlfriends

Ich will in die Berge hinaus.

Drum möcht' ich nach Haus
Do weißt nicht wie sehr sie mir fehlt.

Die Blumen der Berge.

I'm with the NAAM Brigade so warn your boys

I snatch don't go and get paid
I crack eggos, break gats down like Legos
Bring 'em home for toys
Mami bitch roll on my woods
If you can't roll through the hood
Play like Snoop Dogg and lay low
Go peep Rambo, on five-eight
and them two door eight-five-o like its nine tray
My dough, my flow heavyweight
hit stages, rock mics pull dykes
Every state--wait, can't forget where I'm from
Dump narcotics, grip nines rock Nikes
Everyday me and Sonny Black roll with the K
Flip ya Cadillac, bloody you lay (what the beat say?)
Another one (bites the dust)
Don't make Freeway fuck you up!
Shoot up your way!

[Chorus: Sonny Black + Freeway]
[Sonny Black] We got the streets on smash
Clubs on smash; chicks we gon' smash (early in the game)
[Freeway] And we got flows, who want drama?
We got gats leave bullet holes in cats
[Sonny Black] We got the charts on smash
and yo' click trashed; act up and get smashed (early in the game)

We got caps leave chickens with pecks

Blaze baretta bullets I like beats from Timbaland
Niggas see me say that's him again
He all about them benjamins
Tried to change my ways but God know I'm gon' sin again
Smokin drinkin gin again
Bad bitches, got ten of them
Cop two trucks got ten in them
Cop coke off Dominican
Blaze my mac 10 again
Hot lead I put it into them
Blood rush my adrenaline
Ain't tryin to see the bin again
Killin all why'all men and them
To hell is where I'm sendin them
Caskets is what I'm endin them
Forever they gon' live in them
Any nigga that's scared of em
or any fuckin friend of them

And that nigga got what in the stash?
Went right on it

When the mac spit, you'll lay in caskets

My life works design
So happy you could join us that you’ve spared us your time.
Can’t wipe the smile, this stupid grin off my face
So blissful and tiny, perfect to disgrace
I can smell it, I love the taste of your fear
Scream all you want there’s no one around to hear
We are live now, And you are the main Star
Stripped you buck naked, tied up, wear the scars.

Tears fall, pure gold, payers to see 
Accept your fate, no escape from the monster in me.

The deep web hides, the burrows cries
Uncovered secrets, Searching through the abyss

We’re going to watch you burn
Pour The Gas, Strike The Match, No return
Another innocent lost
Raped, Tortured for your sick lust
Light The Fire, light the fire, Court adjourned.

I’ve hit record and this dark world can see
Your pain and torment, the gift you’ll give to me
My composed hands grip you like a corset.
You shall not forget, the haunting contempt

Whip cracks and blood gushes from your wounds
There’ll be no answers to your prayers
10,000 per view of forced entry
Red Room of worst nightmares has come true.

So many nights i had to witness the anguish
Your victims, bound and screaming out for help

You’re just another demon karma will vanquish
Their justice will be served, your evil days are done

Skin Melts, The torture pure agony
How’s it feel to be one with the flames
No remorse,  you never showed empathy
we’ll disgrace your charred remains.",The Burrow,2018

You can feel the eyes are watching you
But don’t know how far, you’ll have to 

Run from it light is fading to black
And you know it’s coming for you coward
Set to attack, the darkness

Feeds off you knowing you’ll never win
And you feel the fear it’s growing 
Time to retreat within, because it’s

Impossible you’re tired and weak
No matter what you do you’re stuck
These depths are hollow and bleak

This silence paralyzing crushing waves of despair
Slowly it eats away your mind cannot comprehend
Isolation from this world is all I have left
They talk but there’s no comfort
Words from the ones who care

Darkness surrounds me I won’t let it in
Demons they dance, when will this end?
Follow me down to the depths where they reign
Ripped from the light again

The depths consume all
And give nothing back
Down in this hole
Fall through the black once again

Cry Out, Cry Out.

Cry out in pain this fading light
Extinguished help denied

Claws, they tear knives through my 
Soul, blood runs so cold
I, will drown in darkness slowly these cracks begin to show
This, rage grows inside me, lash out at all those that I hold close
Hate, myself for all the things i’ve done to keep composed

Shadows reflection of my mind
Regret it blinds
Twisted archetype

And in time I come to find
This hell made in my mind
Was all for nothing

When I break these chains
They’ll fall beneath me 
Tonight, Tonight they will fall

As the black sun rises
The Sky, The sky will cry blood
I’ll reap what you have sewn",The Depths,2018
Naberus,"I replay it over and over
Trying to think, of how i could change things
These memories can’t be forgotten
Pictures of you, lay inside broken frames

I never thought that this would end
Taken for granted can’t amend
These mistakes
These mistakes haunt me

Forever butting heads in fights
So many angry sleepless nights
These mistakes
These mistakes haunt me

You tore my heart out, threw it onto the floor
Stabbed my back, poured salt into the sore
My trust is tattered, broken, words cannot heal
Is this the end, These scars I can’t conceal

Was not supposed to be like this
Left me to rot in this abyss
I still can’t grasp the reasons why
Did you forget how hard we tried
It was supposed to be me and you
Adversity? We’d push right through
These wounds are fresh, but they will mend
The scars will fade, after this ends

How could
You betray me
Went all these years, to end in agony

Black Tears
Stream down my face
I never thought i’d suffer this disgrace

I never thought that we’d end up like this
I never thought that we’d end up like this
I never thought that we’d end up like this

And now you’re begging for forgiveness?
Forgiveness?

I will not, I will not

I won’t forgive you and forget
Waste of my time, stupid regret
You ripped my heart right from my chest
This memory won’t be repressed",The End,2018
Naberus,"Born into this hell alone
And that’s the way I’ll go
Till death
I can’t stand this

You’re the reason that I am Here
And now you Disappear
Left us with nothing

Hate helps me to survive
Don’t know the reasons why
I just keep pushing

Done the way just like you were
But no excuses here
Oh I can feel the

Exhaustion takes it’s hold
All introspection lost
Cracked stone erodes revealing
What will be the cost

We’re fading stripped of sanity
I’m drowning in this hate
This broken path lead us astray
Confused I push away

Thoughts of hate consume my mind
To be revealed in time
Darkness engulfs when I trust
Memories fall to dust

Waves crash around me drowning, Try to push myself up for air
I’m pushing pulling grasping got to find my way out of here
Your narcissistic ways they leave me trapped i’m feeling despair
And when we will not toe the line, cast aside, with no care

The silence makes it so clear
Your blank expression shows fear
Trapped in this hell you call home
You’ll rot here all alone

The silence makes it so clear
You’ll rot alone in here
Your blank expression shows fear
You’ll rot alone in here

I see the sickness in you
No compassion for your kin
Wick burns the flame that’s within you
Pushed away until there’s nothing left to feel

And now you’ll see that no one around you cares
This empty shell is all you’ll fucking have left

Pick up the pieces ripped torn scattered broken to comprehend
Your life’s work bringing nothing, But you’ll still defend
These actions that bring pain to, those forced to stand you
And we cannot wait to
See all this crumble fucking round you
I will be your end",Fading,2018
Naberus,"I’ve sat and watched you corrupt all the masses
Spread so much hate when loves the goal that you should seek
Look in your eyes all I see is a fascist
Your systems flawed, broken is the way you teach
I’ve heard it all , Your brainwashed slurs 
And your hurtful words, designed to guilt the people into believing
That if they fall, Then they must crawl
Say you know it all, too sick to see how badly you’ve really mistreated them

Your bigot ways are a stain on this sacred land
Conform or feel the wrath of your petty hand 

Your gods above
Taught peace and love
But all you preach
Is intolerance  

The pulpits cries
Self gratify
Just feed the slaves
With your Bigotry

Thump on a book with your answers
Outcast the different man
You’re so, Hollow
Inject the poison with your petty hands
Spread spiteful words through misteachings
Advance the masterplan
You’re so, Hollow
Inject the poison with your petty hands

Seems you’ve forgotten the things you should stand for
Judge the divergent and scorn their point of view
You think you’re saviour would lead you in this war
You’re so misguided, There’s just no getting through
Hates in your blood, You pray for floods
While you sling your mud, destroying every single shred of credibility
The words you screech, they’re just hate speech
And so far they reach,  With you there’s little chance of ever reaching tranquility

The ignorant have set the tone with their outdated views, how did it come to this?

Naberus,"I’ve lost myself again
Just felt this way for far too long
Restless and suffering
Seems there’s no place where i belong
I drove the nails through my own hands
I can’t run or hide from this no more
It’s time to wake up, I am done for

My lungs collapsed, My hearts detached
I can’t escape from my mind
I sink into the floor

Trapped in this cage
So disengaged
I just want to go to sleep forevermore

Apathy has destroyed the things i used to love
No passion left,  one more emotion devoid of
No tears to cry, I’m just an empty shell inside
My tongue is tied, I’ll sit in silence cold outside

When i close my eyes
I feel a pain so deep
It cuts me like a knife
And brings me to my knees

And even though I’ve tried
To break away from here
I just slip back again
Until i disappear

I am a waste of breath
Been fucking useless far too long
Sometimes i pray for death
To take his hand undo my wrongs
I tied this noose around my neck
Take a blade and sever skin from bone
Is this the end, I’m all alone

I can’t erase these thoughts
They’ve just been lingering for far too long
My mind’s against me
I will never find the place where I belong
I’ve lost myself again
Just felt this way for far too long
Restless and suffering
Seems there’s no place where i belong

I drove these nails through my own hands

I’ve tried to run for far too long
Is this where my heart belongs

All hope is gone
I fear the end is near
My mind fades to black
(Just cut the static  and start again)
I’ve got no choice
Have done this to myself
Watch me dig, My own grave
Lost in the maze

It never fucking ends
Every path i choose is painted black
Forgotten how it feels to have value
There’s just no turning back

I’ve lost control of these thoughts
Every memory a tainted view
I’ve tried to put up walls
But these demons they stare right fucking through

Don’t think that  I can fight no more
Fatigued, my mind is racing

Brace for the impact
I’m overwhelmed, just need some space
Broken and abstract
Could this really be my last few days

I need to separate
From my mind, i’ve got to get away

Save Me
I’m falling away
My thoughts disintegrate 
Memories fade to grey
Don’t Let
My Hands slip away
I need you next to me
My favorite memory

So withered the roses
Their leaves turn to black
Neglected and starved 
There’s no turning back

A dreaded crushing careless evil, relentless on my demise
Slowly stealing everything away from me
I don’t know how much longer  I can survive

I need your help right now, need you to pull me out
Please help me find the cure, my mind’s in baron drought
Watch as I fade away,  Inside this place that’s made
To hide me from you, until my dying day
All that I want to see, Is this memory
Can you stay for a while, I love that gorgeous smile
I’m just a burden now, an anchor dragging you down
But all I need is you, please help me to pull through

What lies beneath
A dark world of deceit
Young bloods for slaughter
Naive, they sink with legs set in concrete

Sold lies, that they can make it to the top
Pumped up believe they’re the cream of the crop

Sights set for destruction, from the start
You are fucked from the start you are fucked 

You put this gun to your head, eating the shit that was fed
From their hands, down your throats
Til’ you’re stuffed and you choke

Now as you struggle to breathe
And you collapse to your knees
They’re nowhere to be found, They’re nowhere to be found

I’m sick of hearing these fairy tales
The fables never end,  the truth twisted on it’s head
Delusional minds harvested
Forever dodging these obstacles
Unravelled all of your plans with just a pull on the thread
But still these sharks circle in seas of red

You sold your souls to make it to the top
Lights fade from the stage, endanger all that you’ve got
Prey on the lifeblood,  of youthful fantasies.

Sell them delusions, pipe dreams of the young
Profit from a twisting flick of your tongue
Destroy their optimistic ways 

Caught in their lies
We’re all dead in the water
Tore us to shreds
An ocean dyed in red

It’s in their eyes
They’re aching for the slaughter
Tore us to shreds
An ocean dyed in red

Naberus,"I’m tossed aside 
Neglected and broken
I’m sick of it all
So bleak are the shadows inside

I’ve lost all hope, the fear and dread is never ending
These heinous thoughts swirl twisting through my mind
Ghosts of regret haunt the walls, foundations that i’m building
Slowly cracked the structures tumble down

I’ve tried to cast out these words of doubt
Left lying broken dreams blacked out
I’ve got no voice failure swallows my every word

I’ve tried to run, but I trip over rusty shackles
I have set sail, but still my anchor drags
I hate the man that stares back at me in my reflection 
Shattered the glass,  I’ve got no will to live

Don’t let these demons take hold of you
You’re worth much more than they value

Wake, work, eat, sleep, repeat
Serve like mindless disciples
Praise the dollar, we use to make ends meet
Bow down to the holy saviour
The shrine that holds the gold
Embrace visions of grandeur
Indebted with interest they hold

We’re living the reality that we
Will slave away for every night and day until we
Grow old, wrinkled, tired and grey
Until we bite the dust, our lives stolen from us for nothing

Pay back the gods with minimum wage
For they have set the stage, dangle the carrot on a string above us
We jumped so high with arms outstretched, now we are doomed to pledge
Allegiance to monopolizing business

We’ve slaved our lives away
Bare the scars from where we’ve bled
But what was it for
The pigs just want more
Replace all our hope with dread

We must beg to our masters
Roll on the ground and kiss their feet

It’s in their eyes
There’s no disguise
Their thirst for wealth is so insatiable

Rape the soil
And reap nectar within

They plot their plans
Elaborate scams
To fool us all into believing them

Kill the world
Whilst they steal from the working man

Steal it all 
Steal it all
Grab everything that they can

Steal it all
Steal it all
Everything not tied down

We must beg to our masters
Roll on the ground and kiss their feet

They’ll stop at nothing
Make contracts arranged for your soul
Reward the ignorant with this toll

Creating plastic designed to use out of control.
Cutting hours decrease payroll.

It always ends up the god damn same
I barely please myself, alone anyone else
Criticising me’s your favorite game

I just want to express freely
The way I feel without compromise
I’ve had enough
I’ve lost all fucks
This is where I draw the line

Seems all hope is fading and I’ve lost my sight
Of where I am heading won’t fall in line
I can feel you breathing, hairs stand on my neck
Just please keep your distance
Or you’ll soon regret it

I’ve finally had enough, I’m just not giving a fuck
About anything, You’ve got to say

You think you know what’s best for me
Say I’m rash and reckless
But don’t you plan my destiny
This is mine to own

I am not your slave
I refuse to break
I need to learn from my own mistakes
You want to know what’s best for me
Then just shut up and give me some god damn space to breathe

I’m ready to disappoint you again
In your eyes my mistakes they never end
The pressure is mounting I feel it’s burn
This burden is endless you show no concern

Leave me alone(leave me alone)
Just get the fuck away

You never thought about the pressure that you’re putting on me
A mental breakdown is for sure I’ve lost my sanity
Every night I sit in silence with the same disease
This fucking sickness is opinions of society
Have you ever thought that maybe you’re the one who’s wrong
I bet you didn’t cause you’re stubborn fucking headstrong

Because no matter what I do I’m just a fucking disgrace

I’m just a fucking disgrace",Space to Breathe,2018

But I can feel the end is near
I’ve burnt a hole in my heart
Can see through it crystal clear
My visions blacked out, so obscured by all this crippling disdain
Forgot my purpose, question everything, I’m going insane.

Weary heads scream in distress
Skull and crossbones, purge the chest
Twin edged sword draws blood
Waves crash beneath our feet

Surrender to the sea

We have lost all hope
Slowly slipped through the cracks in the road
Forever doomed we fall apart
There’s no saving our hearts
Split in two

I wear my heart on my sleeve
And bear these scars on my chest
I never thought i would hate
This thing I liked to do best
The pressure’s getting too much
Only myself is to blame
Watch as I let you all down
And we go up with the flames

Black smoke grows thicker day by day
We’re going under, hear the thunderous roar of the flames
 
I’ve been caught in the rip and washed out to sea
Sharks circled around, The deep has swallowed me

I’ve poured so much blood sweats and tears
My body’s numb convulsing
The clock is ticking down the years
Fatigued, my rage is coiling

It always lingered in the back of our minds
But we ignored the signs
Forever sitting on the sidelines
I’m sick of going on this chase
I fear that i am out of place

Have you forgotten?
The way this all came to be
Fire down your orders
Behind your shield
The fodder tossed wayside you foresee.

Sit upon your throne, as if you’re royalty

I will not bow down, to your anointed crown
The very thought of this disgrace sickens me

Hopeless and alone we are our own enemies
How could we let this come to be

Corruption runs through your blood
Like a river overflowing the dam
Forked tongue spits venomous lies
Bluffing foolish into thinking you can
Save money, Be wealthy, Stay healthy. All lies.
All you do is line the pockets of your friends
But soon you’ll meet your own demise

Your two faced persona is being revealed
You’re losing composure. Destroy what you’ve built
Saviour of the greedy, black spot on mankind
Behind the smug smile, A monsters design.

The wolves are gathering in their lairs
Sharpen black teeth, Sheep’s clothes they wear
Stealing from the weak one by one
Webs carefully re-spun

Vampires feast on our necks
Ravenous beasts soar overhead
Destroying the weak one by one
Webs carefully re-spun

Deceptive you twist all the words that you say
Insidious snare traps the souls that you prey
We’ve been bound and gagged, sat silent for too long
It’s time for upheaval, your empire’s swan song

We yearn to be free of your disease

We’ll slit your throat and watch you choke
The blood will trickle down and saturate your lungs
Blatant turncoat, with our last vote
We will throw you to the wolves your rule is done

We won’t bow down to you

Que la batalla ha dado inicio,
Vengo a sacar de quicio falsos MC's con falsos juicios,
Rima vicio,
En ella no encontráis el quicio,
Sólida como edificios,
Profunda, precipicios,
Es mi oficio,
Contar historias espectaculares como fuegos de artificio,
Eludiendo lo ficticio,
Separando lo real de lo falso,
No me canso de seguir cazando letras
Y hacer rimas sin descanso,
Sigo sobreviviendo,
Conviviendo,

Compitiendo con el micro en plena acción,
Es mi generación,
Nuevo milenio,
Esquivando policías con ingenio,
Chocando contra brutos,
Seres brutos por esta ciudad sin dueño,
Leyes del asfalto, con ellas tengo un pacto,
Sientes el impacto,
Esto es más serio que un infarto,
Y ahora estoy arriba,
Me he buscado la vida,
He dado vueltas y vueltas tengo más mundo que un atlas,
Tengo peña a mis espaldas,
Tengo tablas y palabras increíbles,
Mi mierda es invencible,
Por eso salgo ileso,
Soy el pesado obeso me expreso en estilo grueso,
El retorno,
Regreso del hueso duro de roer,
No puedes detener el regreso de NS,
Pocos le pueden vencer.

Estas son las rimas invencibles,
Increíbles,

Dime lo que harías,
Qué harías? Tú siempre perderías,
Bienvenido a las aceras frías
Donde todo es porquería donde nada es como tú creías.

Vuelve el escurridizo,
El rebelde,
El MC que siempre resuelve problemas,
Él que se envuelve en tus penas
Y en tus venas se introduce como la penicilina,
Y conduce velozmente en el circuito de la rima,
El que caza versos como niños cazan lagartijas,
Y guarda más misterio que una puta tabla ouija,

Te tengo atento,
Despierto,
Sin adornos,
Mientras otros MC's te duermen como el cloroformo,

El que esquiva golpes como Jackie Chan,
El que rompe micros y micros como barras de pan,
El que tiene plan,
El que tiene clan el que tiene flour,

Rechaza rimas flacas,
Saca gordas como... el que tiene tropa que le arropa,
El que tiene en vez de boca bazoca,
Y vive la vida loca,
El MC que arroya y te hunde en su paranoia,
Como ese boxeador Óscar también estoy de la olla,
El invencible,
Vivo libre como el viento,
Imparable como el tiempo,
Quieres tú seguir mi ejemplo?

O eres un Judas que esta dispuesto a besarme,
O un francotirador que ahora quiere dispararme,
A ver quién va a atraparme a detenerme,
Mis ideas ahora hierven vengo a contagiar mi germen por barrios,
Ciudades,
Países,
Son las rimas invencibles vienen de las calles grises.
Estas son las rimas invencibles, increíbles,
Dime lo que harías,
Qué harías?
Tú siempre perderías,
Bienvenido a las aceras frías
Donde todo es porquería donde nada es como tú creías.
Donde todo es porquería donde nada es como tú creías.

Así que sabéis quién viene,
Quién golpea ahora en la casa,
Ponéis el listón muy alto pero este MC lo rebasa,
Viviendo de modo intenso estilo sexy,
Ya dormiré en el ataúd,
Digo mientras mezclo whisky y pepsi,

Entra,
Entra,
Bienvenido a mi palacio,
Donde el verso va deprisa y el tiempo corre despacio,
Los fachas son los únicos que no entran en mi casa,
Pero no se les pega,
Se les da un libro,
A ver si se les pasa.

Sigo atrayendo masas,
Con mis ases,
Altas,
Medias,
Bajas clases son testigos de mis frases,
Pesada artillería,
Bombas de relojería,
Hechizos de brujería,
Quedan todas las calles frías,
Qué creías?

NS tras su aliento fabulosos productores del talento,
Cero por ciento y lo siento por aquellos que en mi nunca creyeron,
Cayeron en mi mierda y después se la comieron
Y ahora reconocen que soy incombustible,
Derribarme no es posible,
Mi mierda es invencible.

Nach,"Mi escuela tiene alma y tablas
Va con sudaderas viejas, con las Nikes sucias y la barba larga
No necesita efectos para adornar lo que habla
Rapea lo que vea, os tirotea en dos palabras
Yo empecé rapeando simple, con un sample y temple
El hobby de un adolescente dura para siempre
Un pro desde los 15, y no se rinde, endiente
Que pone en venta sus canciones pero no se vende
Crónico insolente que usa balas de saliva
Mi escuela nunca fue tendencia pero sigue viva
Tenemos iniciativa, perspectiva
Si algo no nos motiva
Subimos el dedo del medio arriba
Hablo de mi equipo, esos tipos que quitan el hipo
Mitos que lanzan cada escrito al infinito
Otros actuando crazy y yo cerrando el pico
Más cerca de Kase que de Jay-Z, no sé si me explico
Tengo a mi clan siguiendo un plan para ganarse el pan
Tengo a mis fans buscando paz, en mí la encontrarán
Tanto charlatán sin más afán que el famoseo
Troceo al holgazán como un croissant cuando lo veo, es fácil
Su música infantil e inútil, la mía es táctil
No habrá bandera blanca en este mástil
Sé que el rapper de actitud nazi y hostil es frágil
Mezclo mi mente con TNT, sale algo así tan ágil
Y como delfines sus fines no me definen
No tines si no lo vives, no opines, no subestimes este nombre
Nach rima sublime, es algo enorme, dime
A cuánto torpe fulminé junto a su melodine
Dejo que rimen, veo que se hinchan y se pinchan
Son muchas Dianas para mi flecha
Piensan en su hucha y no en la lucha
Van sin antorcha, sin mecha
Les echan pronto, porque pronto se han pasa'o de fecha
Soy hombre de palabra, no me hables de números
Sus canciones secas, mis fraseos húmedos
Sinceros, sin peros, sin treguas
Sin pelos la lengua que os lame
Mi mierda es tan seria como un derrame
Ven que les electrocuto y disfruto
No hay sustituto si escupo
Ocho minutos de absoluto rap bruto
No me inmuto si no sueno en radios
Yo sueno en barrios
Mis hombres le echan huevos
Mis hembras le echan ovarios
Pero hay terminas que imitan
Me irrita, buscan visitas y guita
Gritan y gritan, se excitan 
Luego sin más se marchitan, mi música es dinamita
Los decapita, les quita su ego
Luego es normal que dimitan
Llego, les hiero, soy puro veneno
Cuando me acelero me cuelo en su juego, los hundo
Soy como el hielo, congelo sus celos
Sufren el dinero, los tumbo
Los encadeno, es lanzo mi trueno
Sin freno, sueno y retumbo, así de rotundo
Quiero solo verdaderos guerreros salvando a mi mundo

Mucha selva, poco tigre
Mucha pólvora, poco calibre
Hijo de puta, tírame a mí
No puedes con Nach y Residente

Yo, yo, yo no tengo escuela
Sin que soplara, el viento aprendí a navegar barcos de vela
Mi rima encima de una cumbia como quiera impacta
No sigo ningúna escuela porque soy autodidacta
Nunca seguí las reglas con pistas de rap genéricas
Como un cajón peruano, escribí Latinoamérica
Mi rap no sigue órdenes de ningún sargento
Hijo de puta, yo creé mi propio movimiento
Que narra y sin garras te desgarra
No crecí escuchando a 2Pac, crecí con Violeta Parra
Y cuando deletreo los educo sin pizarra
Con solo dos barras las rockeo sin guitarra
No creo en dioses del rap, mucho menos en reyes
Yo soy la fucking gravedad desafiando las leyes
Yo soy el orden pero cuando se desarregla
Todas mis líneas son curvas, siempre rompo las reglas
Acostado bajo la sombra de una palma, relajado
Compitiendo contra mí mismo porque no tengo a nadie al lado
Me gusta abusar de los raperos fresa
Les dejo la ""R"" en las nalgas impresa
Antes de bajarme esa cerveza
Fácilmente los torturo
Solo les quito el Instagram y vuelven a ser inseguros
Tu moda no creo que dure
Las quinceañeras que te siguen hoy
Ya no te seguirán cuando maduren
Mucha selfie y poco contenido
Se tardan más en el vestuario que haciendo pruebas de sonido
Sus conciertos son todos iguales
Pocas rimas, poca banda, muchos fuegos artificiales
No se me escapan cuando escribo
Son fáciles de identificar porque se visten con colores llamativos
A estos raperitos nunca les he visto la cara
Siempre les veo de espalda
Cuando los pongo en 4 y les subo la falda
Y me los follo por los dos hoyos
Sin apoyo los arroyo, al estilo criollo
Los convierto en caldo de pollo
La policía me busca por acoso sexual
Y por perverso porque como Kase.O: soy un violador del verso
Y la goleo, porque con las dos piernas pateo
En el freestyleo desde el tiro libre la dunkeo
Y sin rodeo, cuando me cabreo, con mi palabreo
Pongo a hablar en árabe hasta los hebreos
A veces le meto tan rápido que el alfabeto no lo veo
A los del maleanteo los abofeteo
Como novela de abuela sin empleo
Mi lengua se tira acrobacias nunca antes vistas
Es malabarista, todo un artista
Y como Michael Jackson hace el Moonwalking por la pista
No hay quién resista al Residente
Cuando los baja caliente, los pongo de rodillas literalmente
Como a los creyentes en el medio oriente
Arrodíllate y reza, soy un talibán, rimando corto cabeza
Con mi destreza les quito el corazón con la boca y lo pongo en la mesa
Encima de pan de hamburguesa
Con mayonesa y sala japonesa
Y un poco de jugo de fresa
Me los desayuno, mi lengua nunca se tropieza
Cuando se expresa, los atraviesa con naturaleza
Mi sopa de letras empieza, abran la represa que llegó la pieza
Que falta en el rompecabezas

Mucha selva, poco tigre
Mucha pólvora, poco calibre
Hijo de puta, tírame a mí

Nach Scratch,"Haced sitio B-Boys,
Que la batalla ha dado inicio,
Vengo a sacar de quicio falsos MC's con falsos juicios,
Rima vicio,
En ella no encontráis el quicio,
Sólida como edificios,
Profunda, precipicios,
Es mi oficio,
Contar historias espectaculares como fuegos de artificio,
Eludiendo lo ficticio,
Separando lo real de lo falso,
No me canso de seguir cazando letras
Y hacer rimas sin descanso,
Sigo sobreviviendo,
Conviviendo,

Compitiendo con el micro en plena acción,
Es mi generación,
Nuevo milenio,
Esquivando policías con ingenio,
Chocando contra brutos,
Seres brutos por esta ciudad sin dueño,
Leyes del asfalto, con ellas tengo un pacto,
Sientes el impacto,
Esto es más serio que un infarto,
Y ahora estoy arriba,
Me he buscado la vida,
He dado vueltas y vueltas tengo más mundo que un atlas,
Tengo peña a mis espaldas,
Tengo tablas y palabras increíbles,
Mi mierda es invencible,
Por eso salgo ileso,
Soy el pesado obeso me expreso en estilo grueso,
El retorno,
Regreso del hueso duro de roer,
No puedes detener el regreso de NS,
Pocos le pueden vencer.

Estas son las rimas invencibles,
Increíbles,

Dime lo que harías,
Qué harías? Tú siempre perderías,
Bienvenido a las aceras frías
Donde todo es porquería donde nada es como tú creías.

Vuelve el escurridizo,
El rebelde,
El MC que siempre resuelve problemas,
Él que se envuelve en tus penas
Y en tus venas se introduce como la penicilina,
Y conduce velozmente en el circuito de la rima,
El que caza versos como niños cazan lagartijas,
Y guarda más misterio que una puta tabla ouija,

Te tengo atento,
Despierto,
Sin adornos,
Mientras otros MC's te duermen como el cloroformo,

El que esquiva golpes como Jackie Chan,
El que rompe micros y micros como barras de pan,
El que tiene plan,
El que tiene clan el que tiene flour,

Rechaza rimas flacas,
Saca gordas como... el que tiene tropa que le arropa,
El que tiene en vez de boca bazoca,
Y vive la vida loca,
El MC que arroya y te hunde en su paranoia,
Como ese boxeador Óscar también estoy de la olla,
El invencible,
Vivo libre como el viento,
Imparable como el tiempo,
Quieres tú seguir mi ejemplo?

O eres un Judas que esta dispuesto a besarme,
O un francotirador que ahora quiere dispararme,
A ver quién va a atraparme a detenerme,
Mis ideas ahora hierven vengo a contagiar mi germen por barrios,
Ciudades,
Países,
Son las rimas invencibles vienen de las calles grises.
Estas son las rimas invencibles, increíbles,
Dime lo que harías,
Qué harías?
Tú siempre perderías,
Bienvenido a las aceras frías
Donde todo es porquería donde nada es como tú creías.
Donde todo es porquería donde nada es como tú creías.

Así que sabéis quién viene,
Quién golpea ahora en la casa,
Ponéis el listón muy alto pero este MC lo rebasa,
Viviendo de modo intenso estilo sexy,
Ya dormiré en el ataúd,
Digo mientras mezclo whisky y pepsi,

Entra,
Entra,
Bienvenido a mi palacio,
Donde el verso va deprisa y el tiempo corre despacio,
Los fachas son los únicos que no entran en mi casa,
Pero no se les pega,
Se les da un libro,
A ver si se les pasa.

Sigo atrayendo masas,
Con mis ases,
Altas,
Medias,
Bajas clases son testigos de mis frases,
Pesada artillería,
Bombas de relojería,
Hechizos de brujería,
Quedan todas las calles frías,
Qué creías?

NS tras su aliento fabulosos productores del talento,
Cero por ciento y lo siento por aquellos que en mi nunca creyeron,
Cayeron en mi mierda y después se la comieron
Y ahora reconocen que soy incombustible,
Derribarme no es posible,
Mi mierda es invencible.

Estas son las rimas invencibles,
Increíbles, dime lo que harías,
Qué harías? Tú siempre perderías,
Bienvenido a las aceras frías
Donde todo es porquería donde nada es como tú creías
Donde todo es porquería donde nada es como tú creías",Rimas Invencibles,2000
Nacha Guevara,"Lastima bandoneón, mi corazón
Tu ronca maldición maleva
Tu lágrima de ron me lleva
Hacia el hondo bajo fondo
Donde el barro se subleva

La vida es una herida absurda
Y es todo, todo tan fugaz
Que es una curda, nada más

No ves la pena que me ha herido?
Y háblame simplemente
De aquel amor ausente
Tras un retazo del olvido

Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó
Llorando mi sermón de vino
Pero es el viejo amor
Que tiembla, bandoneón
Y busca en el licor que aturda
La curda que al final
Termine la función
Corriéndole un telón
Al corazón

Un poco de recuerdo y sinsabor
Gotea tu rezongo lerdo
Marea tu licor y arrea
La tropilla de la zurda
Al volcar la ultima curda

Cerrame el ventanal, que arrastra el sol
Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris
Tras el alcohol

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?

Nacha Guevara,"Acaricia mi ensueño
El suave murmullo
De tu suspirar.
Como ríe la vida
Si tus ojos negros
Me quieren mirar.
Y si es mío el amparo
De tu risa leve
Que es como un cantar,
Ella aquieta mi herida,
Todo, todo se olvida.

El día que me quieras
La rosa que engalana,
Se vestirá de fiesta
Con su mejor color.
Y al viento las campanas
Dirán que ya eres mía,
Y locas las fontanas
Se contarán su amor.

La noche que me quieras
Desde el azul del cielo,
Las estrellas celosas
Nos mirarán pasar.
Y un rayo misterioso
Hará nido en tu pelo,
Luciernagas curiosas que verán
Que eres mi consuelo.

El día que me quieras
No habrá más que armonía.
Será clara la aurora
Y alegre el manantial.
Traerá quieta la brisa
Rumor de melodía.
Y nos darán las fuentes
Su canto de cristal.
El día que me quieras
Endulzará sus cuerdas
El pájaro cantor.
Florecerá la vida
No existirá el dolor.

Nacha Guevara,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

Convierte
El aire en gas natural
Un duelo salvaje
Advierte

Lo cerca que ando de entrar
En un mundo descomunal
Siento mi fragilidad

Vaya pesadilla
Corriendo
Con una bestia detras
Dime que es mentira todo
Un sueno tonto y no mas
Me da miedo la enormidad
Donde nadie oye mi voz

Deja de enganar
No quieras ocultar
Que has pasado sin tropezar
Monstruo de papel
No se contra quien voy
O es que acaso hay alguien mas aqui?

Creo en los fantasmas terribles
De algun extrano lugar
Y en mis tonterias
Para hacer tu risa estallar

En un mundo descomunal
Siento tu fragilidad

Deja de enganar
No quieras ocultar
Que has pasado sin tropezar
Monstruo de papel
No se contra quien voy
O es que acaso hay alguien mas aqui?

Demasiado tarde para comprender

Duermo por la noche me pongo a escuchar

Ya casi rompo las cadenas 
Ya casi grito que llegó la libertad (Que llegó la libertad) 
Siento que mi alma estará llena 
Y mi corazón también en paz 

Volveré a poner mis pies sobre la carretera 
Caminaré a un mejor futuro 
Ya la espera desespera 
Desespera perder tanto en el daño de una era 
Yendo hacia atrás con tantas ganas de llevar la delantera 

Cómo quisiera ver que se regrese el tiempo 
Volver a los momentos de magia y de ensueño 
La suerte que yo tuve cuando pequeño 

Tengo que ser valiente, valiente 
La fe nunca la debo perder 
Tengo que ser más fuerte, más fuerte 
Subir mi voluntad a otro nivel 

De espíritu rebelde, valiente
Para mejorar este presente y saber lo que se siente 

Librarse de la tiranía 
De un movimiento en agonía 
De la dura situación de cada día 

Que vuelva la alegría 
No pares que ya vamos en la vía 
Seguir luchando es la garantía 

Si es que mis horas se fueran parando en tierra y guerreando 
Prefiero eso que estar con la crisis modelándote 
Un carro, mil joyas 
Y otro anhela tener comida en la olla

Caminar en libertad (valiente)
Ir por las calles así normal (valiente)
Así nomás, valiente 
Caminar en libertad (por la vida que me queda)
Ir por las calles así normal 
Venezuela no se olvida 
Todo lo que nos ha dado 

A los que estamos aquí 
Y a los que están del otro lado 
Que puede ser tu hermano 
Que puede ser tu amigo 
Que puede ser todo lo que yo he querido 

Tengo que ser valiente, valiente 
Salir a caminar contigo 
Y rescatar nuevamente

Nada,"There's a gem in every person
And there's a gem in I
Everybody's got a soft spot
Even the porcupine

Don't listen to the rhythm
Don't think about these words
Just think about a river

Listen to the birds
They know that you're looking
For something to happen
And it will happen soon

There's a God in every body
And there's a God in you
Everyone comes into this world
Without a license or a shoe

Just listen
They know that you're looking
For something to happen
And it will happen soon

Give in to love, give in to something else
Than your selfish self
Give in to love and suddenly
Your world will turn round

There's a soul in every person
And there's a soul in you
Every body has a spirit
Even the well to do

Just look at all the people
All running with the herd
Behind all of our actions
Beneath all of our words

They know so much more
Than what we'll ever fathom
And you know something too

Give in to love, give in to something else
Than your selfish self
Give in to love, give in to love
And suddenly your world will turn round

Don't put off breaking up when you know you want to
Prolonging the situation only makes it worse
Tell him honestly, simply, kindly, but firmly
Don't make a big production
Don't make up an elaborate story
This will help you avoid a big tear-jerking scene
If you want to date other people say so
Be prepared for the boy to feel hurt and rejected
Even if you've gone together for only a short time,
And haven't been too serious
There's still a feeling of rejection when someone says
She preferres the company of others to your exclusive company
But if you're honest, and direct
And avoid making a flowery emotional speech when you break the news
The boy will respect you for your frankness
And honestly he'll apeciate the kind of straightfoward manner in which you told him your decision
Unless he's a real jerk or a crybaby you will remain friends

That all the love you've been giving
Has all been meant for you.

I'm looking for someone to change my life.
I'm looking for a miracle in my life.
And if you could see what it's done to me
To lose the the love I knew
Could safely lead me through.

Between the silence of the mountains
And the crashing of the sea
There lies a land I once lived in
And she's waiting there for me.

But in the grey of the morning
My mind becomes confused
Between the dead and the sleeping
And the road that I must choose.

I'm looking for someone to change my life.
I'm looking for a miracle in my life.
And if you could see what it's done to me
To lose the the love I knew
Could safely lead me to
The land that I once knew.
To learn as we grow old
The secrets of our souls.

It's not the way that you say it
When you do those things to me.
It's more the way you really mean it
When you tell me what will be.

Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door?
With a thousand million questions
About hate and death and war.

It's where we stop and look around us
There is nothing that we need.
In a world of persecution
That is burning in it's greed.

Nadezhda Panayotova,"The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know

Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free

Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I stay
Let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past

Let it go, let it go
When I rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway",Let It Go [From Frozen/Multi Language Medley],2014

Este acto ya lo se
Eeconozco que de actor
Lo tienes todo, ya ni modo
Continua en tu papel

No me extraña, que te alejes
Eso es parte de tu show
No me engañas, asi que mientras lo aguante
Adelante, que comience la funcion

Ya estoy sentada en la butaca de enfrente
De tu desfachatez
Why me doy cuenta que el papel de inmaduro
Te ha tocado otra vez

El primer acto lo compartes conmigo
Solo para pelear
Why en el segundo haces
Mutis de pronto
No vuelves a hablar

En el tercero es cuando siempre
Me entero de tu infidelidad
Con el teatro de tu amor me has mostrado
Como debo de actuar

Que talento, que cinismo
Venga un oscar para ti
Tu argumento me lo se ya de memoria
Vaya historia la inventas para mi

No remedias con tus cuentos
Mis heridas de mujer
Tu comedia ya no quiero soportarla
Ve a montarla con la que dormiste ayer

Ya estoy sentada en la butaca de enfrente

Nadia Ali,"Once upon a time there lived a girl 
She knew what she wanted from the world 
In the brown eyes they could see 
The fire that burned like summer heat 
Nothing but trouble, so they thought 
They just watched her from afar 
If they looked close, the flame was a tear 
That they had seen a girl so fierce 

You better run, you better run 
You don't know what you're in for 
You don't know,you don't know 
What you're in for 
You better run you better run 'cause 
You don't know what you're in for 

Once upon a time there lived a boy 
He would only play with real life toys 
One hand here and one hand there 
No attachments this man wears 
A smile so sweet it's hard to see 
That there's no fruit growing in his tree 
Once a fool, he learned long ago 
It's better to burn than to feel that cold 

You better run, you better run 
You don't know what you're in for 
You don't know,you don't know 
What you're in for 
You better run you better run 'cause 
You don't know what you're in for  

Play with fire and you will get burned 
Play with fire and you will get burned
Will get burned

You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you and now you've gone away
Don't you see that now you've gone
And I'm left here on my own
That I have to follow you and beg you to come home

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever I will understand
Believe me, believe me I can't help but love you
But believe me I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and quite unreal
All that's left is loneliness there's nothing left to feel

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever

Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,

Tu recherches cette lueur qui se révèle à la faveur do soir
Le doux parfum d'un kiss...qui s'échange sans gravité
Décollage pour les abysses de ma véritable personnalité

Space...Mon amour est space....Mais si tu peux...
Entrer dans ma dimension see'est ok pour un vol à deux

Ressentir mes vibrations see'est moi qui mène le jeu

Avec elle, je me sens comme Captain Kirk
(Captain qui?) En tout cas pas comme Loïs et Clark
Jouant les lovers dans un parc
Parce que comme une tigresse elle aime laisser ses marques
Vas-why putain miss lâche do leste,
J'veux partir avec toi le temps d'un trip céleste
T'es parée pour le test, bébé tombe la veste
Abandonne-toi au best, et je m'occupe do reste, ho!

Sinon pour sa conquête bye bye!

Guidée par mon étoile quand je laisse m'emporter le hasard
Si avide de contrées que bien d'autres ne peuvent s'apercevoir
Je veux briser la glace, juste le temps de tester
Partir pour l'hyperespace et me perdre au fin fond de la voix lactée

J'suis le mec qu'il faut, accroche ta ceinture lady
Hey, macho, prouve-moi que t'assure baby
Laisse-moi fare, ""yo!"", j'ai la manière
Et tu vas très bientôt quitter la terre

To the mystery of nature, so reach for the sun
Spruce tips and cedars now free up them rivers

Uniting the nations, it's gonna take some patience
So unzip your sheepskin, the wolves have returned

Union of all things, like words on the sky
I read the totems, my ancestors wrote 'em
Now I sit patient, as I wait on the tribe
This runs through all things, like thunder and lightning
Song everlasting, well always I learn
Pull off the old skin, now we are kindred
Open and listen, the wolves have returned

So channel the old ones, with each waking new sun
Walk with your totem, conditions unsaid
Walk from the mystery, a love where you feeling
Myrrh for protection, a spear in your hand
In light of our dreaming, never meant to be easy
Sometimes there'll be water, sometimes you'll be dry
Footprints in tandem, in this ancient sandstone
Grandmothers reside, and I'll be by your side
Oh, I will be by your side
Grandmother, I will be your side, oh

Part of creation is making a statement
You can't escape it, she's coming for you
If it was up to me, I'd teach that the lonely
This is just part of the courage it takes
Maybe it's the music, it's moving right through us
All of the songs that will outlive me

This is not were I wanna be tonight cause I can not pretend that it feels right.

Stuck in an endless loop, so switch the route to input too.

Somehow I have to find 
And as I try to make my way 
To the ordinary world

""Pride will tear us both apart"" 
Well now pride´s gone out the window 
Cross the rooftops, run away

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As,1995

Because I'm right here, and I'm ready

Treat you like you're nothin' when you're worth more than gold
Girl to me you're like a diamond, I love the way you shine
A hundred million dollar treasure, I'll give the world to make you mine

I'll touch the places he would not
And some you never knew would get you hot

What good is a diamond? Nobody can see it
I hear he got you on lock down but I got the master key, yeah

Where there's love overflowing
I wish I were home, I wish I was back there

Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinkling the sea
Makes it all clean

Maybe there's a way for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend
Let me start again

Suddenly my world's gone and changed it's face
But I still know where I'm goin'
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growin'
If you're listening God, please don't make it hard to know
If we should believe the things that we see
Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?
Or is better just to let things be?

Raindrops falling on a broken rose
Down in some valley where nobody goes
And the night blows in like the cold dark wind
Faithless love like a river flows

Faithless love where did I go wrong
Was it telling stories in a heartbreak song
Where nobody's right and nobody was wrong
Faithless love will find you
And the misery entwine you
Faithless love where did I go wrong

Well I guess I'm standing in the hall of broken dreams
That's the way it sometimes goes
Whenever a new love never turns out like it seems
I guess the feeling comes and goes

Faithless love like a river flows
Like raindrops falling on a broken rose
Down in some valley where nobody goes
Faithless love has found me
Thrown its chilly arms around me

From nowhere, from nowhere (nowhere)

Not to make questions
Perfect place
Not to make questions
Perfect place
But anything can happen
But nobody asks, and nobody asks

(not to make questions)
Want love
Like you ever had
Whenever you want
Whenever you want
Whenever you want

You're running away
From nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
This is your home - welcome

Not to make questions
Not to (x3)

Not to make

Not to make questions
Not to (x3)

Not to make...



",Nobody Asks,2003
Najwa,"And now, and now
Shut up for an instance

And how, and how
Stop this stupid violence

And now , and now
Shup up for an instance

You think the way we behave
It's anti esthetic
And if you think the way we feel
It is just pathetic

I have to tell you
That we are extraordinary
And that you're not going to make
No last, a modification
Obviously the power of our rhythms
Would make you change your mind
And make you not to damage our armony

Because it's nothing to do,
Nothing to compare... With this love
There is nothing to do
And nothing to compare with our

Because it's nothing to do,
Nothing to compare... With this love
There is nothing to do
And nothing to compare with our

If you know a way more easier
If you're not to do and treat me right
Oh that's the way

Obviously the power of our rhythm
Would make you change your mind
And make you not to damage our armony



",Nothing to Do,2003
Najwa,"This is a believer's song
This is a believer's song
Only one truth
Only one truth
And one and other lies

This is a believer's truth
This is a believer's truth
Human cradle
One more straggler
This is a believer's truth
It's only one
One and other lies

How to get started?
Naked and flowered
Breathing for the winds that don't care
For our beliefs

Where's my father? I miss my brothers

This is a believer's truth
Only one belief and truth
So that's the universal law

Learn to enjoy it more and more
I miss my father, I miss my brothers
So don't cry for a while
Take a chance
For hesitation and smiles

This is a believer's truth
Only one belief and truth
So that's the universal law
Learn to enjoy it more and more

This is a believer's truth
One and other lies

This is a believer's truth
Just one - one

No more lies, no more lies
This is...



",One and Other Lies,2003
Najwa,"I'm wasting my time
Running from you
A job without hope
Or a hope without a job

So I take my time
If I was you
And you were me
What would we be?

I'm wasting my time
Running from you
A job without hope
Or a hope without a job

So I take my time
If I was you
And you were me
What would we be?

I'm trained by you
Training by the rules
Training for the time
We spent together

I'm trained by you
Training by the rules
Training for the time
We spent together

You touch my body
Like it has something to say
Laying me down
I just forgot my name
So you're getting my head
Getting my heart
Getting my bed

We lived our dreams
Laying down on the floor
Touching my body
Like it has something to say
So you are getting my head
Getting my heart
Getting my soul
Getting my bed

You touch my body
Like it has something to say
Laying me down
I just forgot my name
So you're getting my head
Getting my heart
Getting my bed

We lived our dreams
Laying down on the floor
Touching my body
Like it has something to say
So you are getting my head
Getting my heart
Getting my soul
Getting my bed



",Trained,2003
Najwa,"Something awful has made the incision
Drifting out
Brass coloured metal tip

Even in the desert
The commandoes
Synchronizing
With visibility

Being safe is not being alive
Being safe is not being alive
Or being alive it's like being safe
Being alive it's like being safe
If this world is not a safe place
Then let's live
That's my victory

Natural extension of gods fingers
Even in combat
Trying to help
But I'm not religious
So I can't believe that
Sometimes this gonna end

Being safe is not being alive
Being safe is not being alive
Or being alive it's like being safe
Being alive it's like being safe
If this world is not a safe place
Then let's live
That's my victory
