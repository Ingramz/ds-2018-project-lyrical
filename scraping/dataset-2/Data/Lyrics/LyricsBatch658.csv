Marianne Faithfull,"Charming, someone to fear
Handsome, very much here
Evil, dancing through fire
Whore of Babylon, world famous clear

Something to charm
Danger, someone to harm
Falling into the mire
Climbing, higher and higher

Someone to fear
Handsome, very much here
Evil, dancing through fire
Whore of Babylon, world famous clear

Ivory tower
Longing for something now
Waiting, hour after hour
Give me some of your power

Citadel, a prison of sorts
Only the rich make the laws
Using repression and force
Whore of Babylon, City of Quartz

Someone to fear
Hidden and very much here
Hatred summoned so near
Whore of Babylon, world famous clear",City of Quartz,2005
Marianne Faithfull,"Hated by all and everywhere he goes
Blazing contempt for human life and lies
Murder as art and what he knows he knows
From life and fear in other people's eyes

Crazy love is all around me
Love is crazy love is kind
But I know somehow you'll find me
Love is crazy love is blind

She walks the boulevard without a care
Knowing too much but having come so far
Pretending life is just a game you play for nothing
Loving no one and no where

Crazy love is all around me
Love goes crazy given time
But I know somehow you'll find me
Love is crazy love is blind

She looks as if expecting a surprise
Maybe an encounter that will change her life
Not knowing hot from cold or good for bad
If life is just a joke or if it makes her sad

Crazy love is all around me
Love is crazy love is kind
But I know somehow you'll find me
Love is crazy love is blind

Crazy love is all around me
Love goes crazy given time
But I know somehow you'll find me
Love is crazy love is blind",Crazy Love,2005
Marianne Faithfull,"Desperanto spoken here,
Today I hear it everywhere,
It is the language of Despair
It's in your nails and It's in your hair
It's in your mouth instead of air
It's in your house
It's in your heart
It's in your mind
It's everywhere

It's in your heart 
It's in your heart

To speak in Desperanto here
And I know you'd never dare
To speak the language of despair
C'mon baby get over here
C'mon baby get over here
It's in your mouth

It's in your hair
It's in your tiny little prayer

The Desperanto they are broken here
Broken darlin' by Despair
The rain it speaks
The wind the air

Today I hear it everywhere
It's in your tiny little prayer
It's in your tiny little prayer
It's in your breath
It's in your tears

This has been going on for years
It's in your mouth

Marianne Faithfull,"It's hard to believe
In the factory
How they made you
And they made me

Made of ideas
Made to think and feel
Do you feel too much?
Do you feel too real?

You're so full of life
What do you want with mine?
How I loved you once
How I loved you twice

Did I have to pay
Such a heavy price?
How I loved you more
Than my own life

Just to be
You and me
Almost real
Almost free

It's hard to believe
In the factory
How the satin feels
And the diamonds gleam

How they made our eyes
Made our hearts and minds
How they built us to
Leave it all behind

Just to be
You and me
Almost real
Almost free

Just to be
You and me
Almost real
Almost free",In the Factory,2005
Marianne Faithfull,"Lost his own, taken down
All his songs
Till his all alone
And all our love was harmed
'cept for you
I'm only young, favorite son
Say you tried, take it back
To where you belong
And all the things you say

Still untrue
We saw the green fields
Turn into homes
Such lonely homes
We saw the green fields
Turn into homes
Such lovely homes
Do what you want to do!
I was digging up, sorting out,
Only to built a song alone
Till you came along
But all my love was there
Just all for you
And in the darkest time
We crossed the line
Made a song
Cause all the talk was wrong
And all you ever won

Can still be true
We saw the green fields
Turn into homes
Such lonely homes
We saw the green fields
Turn into stone
Such lonely homes
We saw the green fields
Turn into homes
Such lovely homes
We saw the green fields
Turn into stone
Such lonely stone
Now all my love is out
It's just for you
It's not a love song 
It's the last song for you",Last Song,2005

Marianne Faithfull,"When you're not by my side
The world's in two, and I'm a fool
When you're not in my sight
Then everything, just fades from view
The mystery of love belongs to you 
The mystery of love belongs to you
Tell me, have you changed your mind?
Am I a fool, because of you?
Tell me, do we still have time?

But there are things that you must learn
That every man must stand alone
And family you must disown

Go home, find your own way

Go home, find your own way
Go on, find your own way

Don't cry my child, you must know

Marianne Faithfull,"Do you remember me ? how we used to be helpless and happy and blind ?
Sunk without hope in a haze of good dope and cheap wine ?
Laying on the living-room floor on those indian tapestry cushions you made
Thinking of calling our first born jasmine or jade.

Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it to me,
Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about what it might be,
Don't get up to open the door, just stay with me here on the floor,
It's gonna get cold in the 1970's.

You wouldn't listen, you thought you knew better, you just to had to speak to that man.
Please believe me, I'll visit whenever I can.
Laying in your little white room with no windows and three square sedations a day,
You plead with the doctor who's running the show,
""please don't take jasmine away and leave me alone.""


Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it to me,
Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about what it might be,
Don't get up to open the door, just stay with me here on the floor,
It's gonna get cold in the 1970's.

Do you remember me ? how we used to be helpless and happy and blind ?
Sunk without hope in a haze of good dope and cheap wine ?
Now in your little white room with no windows and three square sedations a day
You plead with the doctor who's running the show,
""please don't take jasmine away and leave me alone.""

Marianne Faithfull,"And under the boughs unbowed
All clothed in a snowy shroud
She had no heart so hardened
All under the boughs unbowed

Each feather it fell from skin
'Til threadbare while she grew thin
How were my eyes so blinded?

A rain cloud, a crane on wing

And I will hang my head, hang my head low
And I will hang my head, hang my head low

Marianne Faithfull,"I am walking through Rome
With my heart on a string
Dear God, please help me

And I am so very tired
Of doing the right thing
Dear God, please help me

There are explosive kegs
Between my legs
Dear God, please help me

Will you follow and know
Know me more than you do
Track me down and try to win me?

Then he motions to me
With his hand on my knee

Of thing happen to you?

Now I'm spreading your legs
With mine in between

Marianne Faithfull,"In Germany before the war
There was a man who owned a store
In nineteen hundred thirty four
In DÃ¼sseldorf

And every night at five o nine

Reflected in his glasses
As he watches her.

Many a smile to tell
Ask my bluebird to sing you
From the heart of a wishing well

Call all my reindeer to graze here
Call all my grain to grow
Then together we flow like the river
Then together we melt like the snow

Many a thought unanswered
Many a tale to tell
Ask my bluebird to sing you
From the heart of a wishing well

The reason for life that we know

Stars aligned and our webs were spun

To the things I learned so well in my youth
I think I'm returning to those days

No more electric trains, no more trees to climb
Thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
Now I think
I've got a lot more than just my toys to lend
Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
And every day can be
My magic carpet ride

So catch me if you can, I'm goin' back",Goin' Back,2011

The past, well now let me tell you about the past
The past is filled with violent joys and broken toys,
Laughing girls and teasing boys.
Was I ever in love? I called it love
I mean, it felt like love,
There were moments when
Well, there were moments when.

(The present)
Go out with you? Why not?
Do I like to dance? Of Course.
Take a walk along the beach tonight?
I'd love to,
But don't try to touch me, don't try to touch me
Cos that will never happen again.
Shall we dance?

(The future)
Tomorrow? Well, tomorrow's a long way off.
Maybe someday I'll have somebody's hand,
Maybe somewhere someone will understand.
You know I used to sing
'A tisket, a tasket, a green and yellow basket.
I'm all packed up and I'm on my way
And I'm gonna fall in love.'
But at the moment it doesn't look good.
At the moment it will never happen again.

Someone who could love me back

In my own particular way
In my own particular way
Capable of loving in my own particular way

In fact my whole life so far
So much rubbish I had to burn
So much I had to go through

Someone who can see all my faults
But love me nevertheless

What I am is not a game

But hard to get away from

And it's very lonely here tonight
Everywhere else there's a full moon

And pretend to be strong when I'm not
There's no moon, no moon in Paris tonight
And it's lonely and that's all I got

No moon, no moon in Paris
And it's very lonely here tonight
When I think of all the moons that shone for us
So distantly
All through the full moon night

It always made me gasp
Gasp with love to see
But that was when I still loved you
And you loved me

Their sins come home to haunt us
From the wrong side of the gun

Who is that creepin' up the stairs in black?
It's a murderer Mama, knife you in the back
They come at night, and the world goes blind with fear
Terror in Paris, the future is here

Cry for them, cry for us, playing the game of death, ah hah!
It's not a game when you are
Down to taking your last breath, whoah oh!

They come at night Mama, just like before
Turn the streets to blood red rivers
Turn your eyes no more
They come at night, and the world goes blind with fear
Iron bars in Europe, the future is here

Those who survived that night are still completely traumatized

You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy
And so I dealt you the blow
One of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
One of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling

She'd always stay at home;
All the neighbors knew little Lilly too well.
For when the boys would call, They'd hear her yell:
 
Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
If you peek in, Can't you see I'm goin' to weaken?
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ma, I'm meeting with resistance, 
I shall holler for assistance,
Ma, he's kissing me!""

But I see your treasures in my magazines

Got the kinda face that would be loved in Hollywood
On my television I get news from Hollywood
Daddy says I'm much too good for the neighborhood

There's a beauty in walking away

I float on the streets that are empty
Take the path that the wind only knows
Tonight is the last time that I'll ever be here

It's never quite simple, it's never that safe
It never seems perfect until it's too late
It's never the right time to find a new way

You're better off alone

Cause nothing that we do feels the same any more
And I'll admit, I'll take the blame

Marié Digby,"Its 3 am as I stumble over to my bed
Got a funny premonition that tomorrow's gonna be the same
But all I remember
Is how we think I heard you call my name
And your open invitation to come over for a drink or two

But when you do well
The true intentions of your secret smile
I couldn't stop
I couldn't tell you no
I hate to say I'm giving in to you

I wake up next to you
Oh we're through with it
I fell in love with a fool
And I know I'm not the only one
You lead your trap beneath the obvious
Until some good girl pulls through
It's true, I'm not the only one
To fall in love with a fool
I fell in love with a fool

At the end of the hall
In room number 804
There was the devil himself and his dark kept secret hell
And curiosity grew with every single following day
And I was dreaming, dreaming that you're here with me
I hate to say I'm giving in to you

[Chorus]

I tell the truth you find it fun to play another
But can't you see that I am only falling further
And tell me why you even took the time to bother
I always knew that you would only bring me trouble
And the way I move I think that I am seeing double
I know you know you will only cause me sorrow

Who sits under the bleachers
Just another day eating alone
And though she smiles
There is something she's hiding
And she cant find a way to relate
But she just goes unnoticed
As the crowd passes by
And she'll pretend to be busy
When inside she just wants to cry
And she'll sing

Take a little look at the life of Miss Always Invisible
Look a little harder, I really really want you
To put yourself in her shoes
Take another look at the face of Miss Always Invisible
Look a little closer and maybe
Then you will see why she waits for the day
When you'll ask her her name

The beginning, in the first weeks of class
She did everything to try and fit in
But the others they couldn't seem to get past
All the things that mismatched on the surface
And she would close her eyes when they laughed
As she fell down the stairs
And the more that they joked
And the more that they screamed
She retreated to where she is now
And she'll sing

Take a little look at the life of Miss Always Invisible
Look a little harder, I really really want you
To put yourself in her shoes
Take another look at the face of Miss Always Invisible
Look a little closer and maybe
Then you will see why she waits for the day

I think my heart is wrapped around
And tangled up in winding weeds

Being so afraid of showing
Someone else my imperfections
And even though my feet
Are trembling
And every word I say
Comes stumbling
I will bare it all... Watch me unfold
Unfold

These hands that I hold
Behind my back are
Bound and broken
By my own doing
And I can't feel
Anything anymore
I need a touch to remind me
I'm still real

Behind the glass house he came walking out the back-door
Into a crowd of screaming girls calling his name

I should be old enough to know
Not to fall in love with the voice on the radio

So here I stand fighting what I feel for you
Torn between what reason says and how I really feel
And here I stand, wondering what to say to you
Hoping that you feel the same, the same as I do

He's in a rock band with a voice like an angel
And eyes of a raven sky
And suddenly I find myself twelve years old again
Dreaming of you

But who am I kidding to even think that you might see me
It's in the stars that girls like me
And boys like you were never meant to be

Would you be scared if I told you I like you
And would you run if I told you I love you

Marie Dubas,"Tout en bas, c'est le Bled immense
Que domine un petit fortin.
Sur la plaine, c'est le silence,
Et là-haut, dans le clair matin,
Une silhouette aux quatre vents jette
Les notes aigües d'un clairon,
Mais, un coup de feu lui répond.

REFRAIN
Ah la la la La belle histoire,
Y'a trente gars dans le bastion,
Torse nus, rêvant de bagarres
Ils ont du vin dans leurs bidons,
Des vivres et des munitions.
Ah la la la La belle histoire,
Là-haut sur les murs du bastion,
Dans le soleil plane la Gloire,
Et dans le vent claque un fanion,
C'est le fanion de la Légion !

Les "" Salopards "" tiennent la plaine,
Là-haut dans le petit fortin
Depuis une longue semaine,
La mort en prend chaque matin ;
La soif et la fièvre
Dessèchent les lèvres,
A tous les appels de clairon,
C'est la mitraille qui répond.

REFRAIN :
Ah la la la La belle histoire,
Ils restent vingt dans le bastion,
Le torse nu, couverts de Gloire.
Ils n'ont plus d'eau dans leurs bidons
Et presque plus de munitions.
Ah la la la La belle histoire,
Claquant au vent sur le bastion
Et troué comme une écumoire,
Il y a toujours le fanion,
Le beau fanion de la Légion !

Comme la nuit couvre la plaine
Les "" salopards "", vers le fortin
Se sont glissés comme des hyènes
Ils ont lutté jusqu'au matin :
Hurlement de rage.
Corps à corps sauvages,
Les chiens ont eu peur des lions.
Ils n'ont pas pris la position.

REFRAIN
Ah la la la La belle histoire,
Ils restent trois dans le bastion,
Le torse nu, couverts de Gloire.
Sanglants, meurtris et en haillons,
Sans eau ni pain, ni munitions.
Ah la la la La belle histoire,
Ils sont toujours dans le bastion
Mais ne peuvent crier victoire :
On leur a volé le fanion,
Le beau fanion de la Légion !

mais tout à coup le canon tonne
Des renforts arrivent enfin
A l'horizon une colonne
Se profile dans le matin
Et l'écho répète
L'appel des trompettes
Qui monte vers le mamelon
un cri de là-haut lui répond :

REFRAIN
Ah la la la La belle histoire,
Les trois sont dans le bastion,
Sur leurs poitrines toutes noires
Avec du sang, cré nom de nom
Ont dessiné de beaux fanions

Ah la la la La belle histoire
Ils peuvent redresser leurs fronts
et vers le ciel crier Victoire :
Au garde à vous, sur le bastion,
Ils gueulent : Présent...La Légion",Le Fanion de la Légion,1996

Elle a appris l´amour par lui

En espérant qu´elles l´atteindront
Comme des bouteilles à la mer
En espérant, un jour, lui plaire

En attendant, elle auditionne
Avec d´autres, elle papillonne
Mais elle regarde son téléphone
En espérant qu´il la sonne
Y en a qui disent qu´elle est conne
Ceux-là n´ont jamais aimé personne
Elle accepte à demi-mot
De n´être qu´un simple numéro

Et pour ne pas désespérer

Un amour tenace n´est pas perdu
Un soir, le voilà revenu

Elle fait visiter ses dentelles
Et le beau se fait la belle
Combien de coups de couteaux
Pour arrêter un cœur si gros?

just a victim of my mind

How I look when I'm undressed to receive you 
Why do you think your love could ever change me? 
Why?
You don't know anything about me baby 
Should I wax or should I shave, 
Be a master or a slave 
Would a good girl misbehave like I plan to 
Do I smile or do I pout,

Baby can't you see that I
Just can't take it anymore 
I need to find some
Kind of light behind the door

And it gets me down, 
Yes it gets me down 
Everybody's got it right but me somehow 
And it gets me down, 
Spins my head around 

Life really should be easier by
Now I read another magazine, 
See the star I've never been 
Hope is something in between all the pages 
So I buy a promise in a jar, 
I try to cover up the scars 
There's no shelter from the storm when it rages 
I've tried so long and hard and nothing changes 
God must be laughing as he turns away

Cold as ice and full of fear

The night turned into black and blue
Still we wondered why me and you
After all we're still here
I held your hand, I felt no fear

Without the mountains or the sea

Why do my past just have to leave

That I loved you anyway
Will I still be proud

That this fight is all about me
Why can't you understand that I'm a child
And a grown up woman

Mother can't you see
That this fight is all about me

But I'm a woman and still a child

Disappointed and proud
I wish I dared to scream out loud
We've been the same
God give me words so I can explain

Don't say I never tried
Don't ever say I lied
Will I still be something

Whose answers I don’t really want to know

Did you whisper that you loved her, 
Drop your kisses on her neck
And with determination, down the wine

But my curves are my virtue
	
I've got no secrets, I'll bare my soul
Nothing to hide when a heart is open, oh
I am more than my reflection

We're all searching for ourselves
Standing before our own eyes
Begging to be noticed
Snowflakes aren't formed in a mold
Flowers don't choose their shades
And butterflies don't paint their wings

Don't try and save me,

Worth The Fight

Fire on your back, Sky painted black

Falling behind
Losing your way
Learning to pray
	
Brilliant parade
Blind masquerade
Waltzing in place
Weaving through space

Flashes of light
Season the night
Living is like 
Chasing fireflies

Twisting the proof
Turning from youth
Laughing at fate
Swinging too late

Loosening lips
Lost battleships
Fighting the lies
Burning inside

Flashes of light
Season the night
Living is like 
Chasing fireflies

A gallery of could-be’s
A library of would-be’s
A destiny of should-be’s
Waiting at your door
The mystery of maybe
A history of save me’s

Worth The Fight

I’d wear my heart on my sleeve to reach you
You guard your love with iron
You’re hiding behind your silence
I’m reading between your lines

I’m a beautiful mess beside you
I’ll try to pretend you’re blind
I’m biting my tongue, it’s eager
I’m fighting to buy my time

I’m lovestung, So lovestung
Waltzing around with my fragile glass heart in my hands
I’m lovestung, So lovestung
I masquerade but I’m learning that I can’t pretend
I’m lovestung

You step on my toes, we’re clumsy
We can’t seem to sway in time
Cause I’m red when you’re blue
And you’re difficult too
But I’d argue with you anyday

I’m lovestung, So lovestung
Waltzing around with my fragile glass heart in my hands
I’m lovestung, So lovestung
I masquerade but I’m learning that I can’t pretend
I’m lovestung

Lovestung, Lovestung
The slipper will break, midnight will chime
And the star that we wish on will fade over time
Cause growing pains ache, & tempers collide
But love like wine will grow sweeter with time

Cause we’re lovestung
So lovestung
We’re scared to death but we’re learning the thrill of the fall

I’m lovestung, So lovestung
Waltzing around with my fragile glass heart in my hands

Wrapped Up In Love
Worth The Fight

You rode a horse and wore your armor proudly
Let down my hair to make a way for you
To climb into the sky and catch the cloud that I’ve been dreaming on

Pulling petals at my window, I’ll be
Singing my songs to the man on the moon
And counting fireflies that dot the canvas of the starry night.

Beyond the mortal dreams of man
Where every tear will be left behind
But it must be in another time, oh

There'll be an everlasting light
Shining a purest holy white
And every fear will be erased
But it must be in another place, oh, oh

So I'm waiting for another time and another place
Where all my hopes and dreams will be captured
With one look at Jesus' face

Oh, my heart's been burning, my soul keeps yearning
Sometimes I can hardly wait for that sweet, sweet someday
When I'll be swept away to another time and another place

I've grown tired of earthly things
They promise peace but furnish pain
All of life's sweetest joys combined
Could never match those in another time, oh

And though I've put my trust in Christ
And felt His spirit move in my life
I know it's truly just a taste
Of His glory in another place, oh, oh

So I'm waiting for another time and another place
Where all my hopes and dreams will be captured
With one look at Jesus' face

Oh, my heart's been burning, my soul keeps yearning
Sometimes I can hardly wait for that sweet, sweet someday
When I'll be swept away to another time and another place
I'm gonna be swept away, oh

Car je sais que tu ressembles, oui je sais que tu ressembles,

un sourire en guise de discours.
Mais pourtant j'en suis certaine, ce soir autant que je t'aime,
oui ce soir tu ressembles à l'amour.

Qui jetaient des mots à tous vents 
Et qui discouraient sans parler 


Qui entendaient sans écouter 
En proposant des chants connus 
Que nulle voix n'a jamais repris 
Et leurs cris 
Couvrent la voix du silence 

Les hommes ne voient plus les fleurs 
Ils en ont pris des rides au coeur 
Ils espèrent en faisant du bruit 
Meubler le vide de leur vie 
Et même au ton, sans un bruit

And did we grow apart or did we just not grow together?

Do our ways converge or do they separate to nowhere?

With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

No one ever smiles the way that you do.

Won't you meet me in Montana.
I want to see the mountains in your eyes.
Woah, woah, I had all of this life I can handle.
Meet me underneath that big Montana sky.

I left home for Hollywood.
Lookin' for a part to play.

Not the joyful sound, when sleigh bells ring (ring ring ring)

Will not bring back the friend, you turned away

Thought I was dreamin' with my eyes wide open
I had to touch you and feel you near
Are you really here?

I plan to be the one who sticks around
Ooh, your love can lift me up above the clouds
I get so high when I'm with you
I may never come down

When forever starts, there's no stopping
No stopping, no stopping your heart
Like a river it just keeps on rolling
Till it fills you up to overflow and
There's no stopping, no stopping
No stopping your heart

When you touch me it's like paradise
Tropical islands and soft moonlight all night
It's almost like fallin' in love
For the very first time

When forever starts there's no stopping
No stopping, no stopping your heart
Like a river it just keeps on rollin'
Till it fills you up to overflow and
There's no stopping, no stopping
No stopping your heart

When you really found it
There's no doubt about it

There's no stopping, no stopping
No stopping your heart
Like a river it just keeps on rollin'
Till it fills you up to overflow and
There's no stopping, no stopping
No stopping your heart

Marie Osmond,"When it comes to love, darling
You can't stray far away
Don't let temptation steal your heart
Love's not a game to play

You think that you can have it all
But baby, that's not true
You'll wake up with the heartache
In a world that's painted blue

When it comes to love
You can't think with your eyes
You can't think with your lips or hands
You can't think with your mind

When it comes to love
You leave the world behind
You can't be worried about what others say
No, you can't think with your mind

Think with your heart
Think with your heart, sweet darling
Think with your heart
Think with your heart, sweet baby

Thinking with your eyes
Gets you into trouble every time
You'll never satisfy your appetite

You think that you'll be happy
If you leave my love behind
But it won't be long
Before you change your mind

When it comes to love
You can't think with your eyes
You can't think with your lips and hands
You can't think with your mind

When it comes to love
You leave the world behind
You can't be worried about what others say
No, you can't think with your eyes

You think with your heart
Think with your heart, sweet darling
You think with your heart
Think with your heart, sweet baby

Pain has no memory
The pleasure you can't forget
Once it gets inside your mind

Temptation takes control
And steals your heart and soul
Once you're thinking with your eyes

Think with your heart
Think with your heart, sweet darling
Think with your heart
Think with your heart, sweet baby

Think with your heart
Think with your heart, sweet darling
Think with your heart

Dans la pluie équatoriale d'un piano noir de concert.
C'est l'enfant de mes reves, il naitrait sans passé, sans regrets

Il prendrait des poissons rien qu'avec ses chansons dans le vent.

Dans le sable il découvrirait des paillettes de diamant

Et à pleines dents il mordrait dans les fruits de la passion.

J'aurais voulu devenir une femme fatale
Mais je ne buvais pas, je ne me droguais pas
Et je n'avais aucun complexe
Je suis beaucoup trop normale, ça me vexe

Je ne suis pas parisienne
Ça me gêne, ça me gêne
Je ne suis pas dans le vent
C'est navrant, c'est navrant
Aucune bizarrerie
Ça m'ennuie, ça m'ennuie
Pas la moindre affectation

Je ne suis pas cinéphile
C'est débile, c’est débile
Je ne suis pas M.L.F.
Je sens qu'on m'en fait grief
M'en fait grief, m’en fait grief

Bientôt j'ai fait connaissance d'un groupe d'amis
Vivant en communauté dans le même lit
Comm' je ne buvais pas, je ne me droguais pas
Et n'avais aucun complexe,
Je crois qu'ils en sont restés tout perplexes

Je ne suis pas nymphomane
On me blâme, on me blâme
Je ne suis pas travesti
Ça me nuit, ça me nuit
Je ne suis pas masochiste
Ça existe, ça existe
Pour réussir mon destin
Je vais voir le médecin
Je ne suis pas schizophrène
Ça me gêne, ça me gène
Je ne suis pas hystérique
Ça s'complique, ça s’complique
Je lui dis je désespère
Je n'ai pas de goûts pervers
De goûts pervers, de goûts pervers 

Mais si, me dit le docteur en se rhabillant
Après ce premier essai c'est encourageant
Si vous ne buvez pas, vous ne vous droguez pas
Et n'avez aucun complexe
Vous avez une obsession : c'est le sexe

Depuis je suis à la mode
Je me rôde, je me rôde
Dans les lits de Saint-Germain
C'est divin, c’est divin
Je fais partie de l'élite
Ça va vite, ça va vite
Et je me donne avec joie
Tout en faisant du yoga
Je vois les films d'épouvante
Je m’en vante, je m’en vante
En serrant très fort la main
Du voisin, du voisin
Me sachant originale
Je cavale, je cavale
J'assume ma libido
Je vais draguer en vélo
Maint'nant je suis parisienne
J'me surmène, j’me surmène
Et je connais la détresse
Et le cafard et le stress

",That's the Way My Heart Goes,2006
Marie Serneholt,"So you say there's nothing wrong 
Then tell me why I don't believe you 
Maybe you sound just to sincere 
Maybe I just saw right trough you 

Cause who's the girl 
Walking there by your side 
The way she smiles I just know 

I wasted love 
I wasted love 
I wasted all my emotions on you 
I wasted love 

So here the walls come tumbling down 
A heart's breaking into a thousand pieces 
I might be damaged but I'll be Ok 
Everything happens for a reason 

Who's the girl 
Walking there by your side 
The way she smiles I just know 

I wasted love 
I wasted love 
I wasted all my emotions on you 
I wasted love 

Everything happens for a reason 

Who's the girl 
Walking there by your side 
The way she smiles I just know 

(I can tell by the way you smile, yeah) 
I wasted love

I wasted all my emotions on you

Marie Sisters,"Bring it on back to me
Had you on my mind
Had to get you on the line
I'll admit I was a little afarid
I was...
Hoping that time
Would somehow change your mind
And make up for the mistakes I made
Couldn't stop
Thinking about you
Knew excatly what I had to do
I had to hear your voice and
I had to say...

Bring it on back
Bring it on back to me
Love walked away 
And lost track of me
But I still hear your voice
And I still call your name
I know it could still be the same
If you bring in on back to me

Boy was I blind
My once in a lifetime
Angel of love
Show me mercy
Wanting you bad
Missing all we had
I just can't live without heaven
So please

Bring it on back
Bring it on back to me
Love walked away 
And lost track of me
But I still hear your voice
And I still call your name
I know it could still be the same
If you bring in on back to me

I die with every emotion, every tear I cry
Oh and I cry for you baby
I swear I'll never stop hoping
Without us tell me what, will I do
Tell me what will I do

Bring it on back
Bring it on back to me
Love walked away 
And lost track of me
But I still hear your voice
And I still call your name
I know it could still be the same
If you bring in on back to me

I am the simple truth everyone knows
There in the shadow of every living soul
I'm just a child going home

Wherever you go
Whatever you've lost
I want you to know
Whenever you give
All that you are
Nothing is lost
In the circle of love

I am the love that was lost in cold war
I spent my youth chasing a dream
I am what's left of my good intentions
But I still want to believe

Whatever you've lost
I want you to know

Marie Sisters,"She gave him her reasons
She said, it would break her heart
To love without commitment
It would be just, too hard
She gave him an ultimatum
She said he would have to choose
Bewtween freedom and forever
And he didn't want to lose

'Cause he was crazy about her
But he was crazy to run
Wild with the horses
When he knew she was the one

He thought about trying
To leave her and live with pain
He knew the ride just wasn't worth it
But he just couldn't let go of the reins

'Cause he was crazy about her
But he was crazy to run
Wild with the horses
When he knew she was the one

But she agreed reluctantly as he stood there at the door
And when he held her as she said goodbye he just couldn't let her go

Because he was crazy about her
But he was crazy to run
Wild with the horses
When he knew she was the one

Crazy to run",Crazy to Run,2002
Marie Sisters,"Was it just the stars aligning
Or a matter of good timing
That made two separate hearts beat as one
Or perhaps a higher power
Giving us our finest hour
And showing us how real our dreams can become
And I'll make this simple promise
From somewhere deep inside
One thing will never change in this life

I will hold on
And if the earth should turn forever
It would not be long enough
I will hold on
And from this moment on together
I will hold on to your love

As natural as breathing
Falling came so easy
Like a feather drifting from the sky
No need to wonder
This magic spell I'm under
Doesn't know the meaning of goodbye
You're the wine and you're the water
You're the cleansing drop of rain
The mystery that only love explains

I will hold on
And if the earth should turn forever
It would not be long enough
I will hold on
And from this moment on together
I will hold on to your love

I never could imagine
That miracles still happen
Until I looked into your eyes

I will hold on
And if the earth should turn forever
It would not be long enough
I will hold on
And from this moment on together
I will hold on to your love",I Will Hold On,2002
Marie Sisters,"Sometimes I wonder why I end up alone
Why I always choose to cut and run
I want someone to love so tell me why
I find a million ways to say goodbye

Hope springs eternal and it says to me
Don't waste another chance so carelessly
I've got lessons learned if nothing else
So I'll make a solemn promise to myself that

If I fall in love tonight
It's gonna be the start of forever
When I face the end, I'll stand and fight
With all my heart
With all my might
If I fall in love tonight

I don't need a drop of sympathy
I chartered the course of my own destiny
I know the right one might have passed me by
But I'd be a bigger fool if I don't try and

If I fall in love tonight
It's gonna be the start of forever
When I face the end, I'll stand and fight
With all my heart
With all my might
If I fall in love tonight

Next time it's gonna be different
I won't close my eyes when love shines down on me

Kiss me goodbye
This is harder than it has to be, did we even try
And everytime you look at me
Your eyes can see right through mine
I'm lookin' at a memory, as it all goes by

Never again will I lie, oh baby
So don't ask me why

Just kiss me goodbye
Just one more time
Baby you know we tried
No more tears to be cried
So just kiss me, just kiss me goodbye

It took longer than it had to take
And I don't know why
I need a little time to break
So I won't let life pass me by
Say everything we have to say
There's no holding back
You'll always have a part of me
And I hope you can live with that

Never again will I lie, oh baby
So don't ask me why

Just kiss me goodbye
Just one more time
Baby you know we tried
No more tears to be cried
So just kiss me, just kiss me goodbye

This was harder than it had to be
But I guess we tried
We'll always have the memory
So come to me don't ask why

Just kiss me goodbye
Just one more time
Baby you know we tried
No more tears to be cried
So just kiss me, just kiss me goodbye

Marie Sisters,"There were guys lined up like dominos
I was sipping on a hot cappuccino
Waiting for my one true romeo
I just hadn't found him yet
Right about then right in front of my blue eyes
An old worn out faded pair of levis
Came walking by holding on for dear life
And my heart said

Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah 
(Where did he come from)
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah 
(How do I get one)
I'm falling in love with the way he walks
Don't stop don't stop
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah 

It's kind of a long story the way we got together
I'd love to tell ya but it would take forever
Just let me say things are better than ever
In my entire life
I'm not the only one who thinks he's something
Cause me and the girls were out doing nothing
He came to pick me up I turned around and asked them
So what do you guys think?

Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah 
(Where did he come from)
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah 
(How do we get one)
Whatever you do don't let him go
Oh no oh no

Tossed over waves of emptiness
Looking glass with no reflection

When I needed life, you were a breath of air
When my soul was a desert, you were a fountain
When I needed a rock, you were a mountain

Would someone reach down and touch me
Light drove the shadows from my heart

Don't be confused by my apparent lack of ceremony
My mind is clear
I may be low or miles high off in the distance
I want you near


I love you, even when I'm sleeping
When I close my eyes
You're everywhere


And if they take me flying on the magic carpet
See me wave
If our communication fails I'll reconnect it
I want to rave


I love you, even when I'm sleeping
When I close my eyes
You're everywhere


No matter where the road is leading us remember
Don't be afraid
We have a continent that sometimes comes between us
That's okay


I love you, even when I'm sleeping
When I close my eyes
You're everywhere

For all the hell that you've been through

The night a sinner kissed an angel,
He wanted thrills, she wanted love,
Oh but his sighs were tender

As he begged her to surrender,

And she believed that it was love.
How was she to know that every lovely vow
Was part of the game he was playing,
But to his surprise he realized
Somehow he meant every word he was saying.

Me feras-tu encore attendre des jours, des mois?

You say good morning
When it's midnight

I wake up to your sunset

Five more days and I'll be home
I keep your picture in my car
I hate the thought of you alone

And see the same sun rising
Turn the hour hand back to when you were holding me

(Turn it up! Turn it up! Turn it up!)
Yo, you see them Refugees right there, they goin' in the car

Woo woo woo woo woo
Keys they goin' in the trunk
Woo woo woo woo woo
Fiends they don't give a uh

And Flex couldn't save you even if he dropped a bomb in this
You still gon' be found in a ditch
My name should be Robin Banks the way I be robbin' banks
I'm a fiend for the S-500 I want it
Used to stay high and blunted, but all that had to stop
Chick like me be chasin' after cops
And they don't stop at my block after the Diallo shootin'
Soldiers in waitin', marksmen recruitin'
Salutin', thug confederates, rhyme and reason
Time and treatin', Air Force One we leavin'
Panama red, holdin' 52 hands for ransom
My man Johnny Handsome, itchin' to cancel 'em
I'm like hold up, wait a minute, let's get down to business
We could shoot up everything soon as the deal is finished
Blah, blah, I got two hours to kill
We want like 5 mil in a private jet so peel

Supreme see been after mean figures, ask my lil' nigga
Since back in the days, before he was raised
Ain't nobody puttin' fear in my heart, who need a jump start
My art sharp, shoot your posse apart
Nigga take you on one by one, gun by gun
Son by son, done by done
Whoever come murder fest, one of the best
I'm gettin' assets, collect ass bets, squat by your address
I come to kick it wit' you, walk beans stickin wit' you
Why try to hide from accomplice vibe
Yo we break bread, break heads, my people shake feds
Gamble and scramble, F what your man do
It's all about this husltin' game, muscle and fame
Tussels in rain, take aim, blush you with game
My language is unexplainable, switch, changeable
And I stay remaindable, with bigger guns aimed at you

Keys they goin' in the trunk

Fiends they don't give a uh

I run up in Da Cypha heavily armed with endless bars of metaphoric harm
A python with poisonous charm, extending my arm
Pushing figures way to the back
Out of your reach, excessive like Fatal Attract
Freeze, a renegade bar stroke, an ace of spades
I'll kiss you wit' a blade when I think I'm gettin' played
Made woman, you never in bed with the same woman
You say you want it, you don't want to see the omen
When my sixth sense start flowin' I bless like holy water
I don't want to die 'cause I'm my daddy's only daughter
But yo, sometimes I see the writin' on the wall
You know the ghetto testaments, the shootouts, the brawls
Close frames in the hall, will you stand or will you fall
Your whole click is on the run now would you tell it all
About the night shifters, me, I'ma cypher drifter
My sixteen bars is up so peace to the mixes

October 31st I was standing by the sour
These thugs don't want to talk they want these Pumas I just bought
Fresh outta school, picked on 'cause I'm bilingual
I barely spoke English but the gun language was universal
Ran in the grocery store, spoke to Gabriel
He said, you have problems, here's a feezy from Israel
Ran back outside, just before I could say another homicide
Threw the biscuit in the bushes runnin' like Jesse Owens
Police showed up, but I was nowhere in existence
Back in the crib thinkin' bout what I just did
I'ma police of defense but I'm bound to catch this bid
My hypothesis was right, they knocked the door, homie
Like a super in the projects wantin' rent money
Just when I thought I get my life straight in the states
Is when I found myself climbin down the fire escape
Bodies found in Virginia under the dumpsters, no
18 shell cases in front of the grocery sto'
Flee the scene of the crime before y'all kick the door
No your honor that must be some old rhyme that I wrote
And lyrics sometime man they misinterpretate it
For example when I say gun I mean my pen and paper
And every time I wave and spit the crowd jump
'Cause I'm still Digital Underground like ""humpty hump""
Feel the funk comin' through your elephant trunks
I ain't even ""Kriss Kross"" my clothes yet
And yet y'all want to ""Jump, Jump"" in Da Cypha, ""Jump, Jump""

And the promise to be near each time you call,

And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon

Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,

Marième,"À chaque jour que God fait
Pour nous c’est le same song
On s’allume un hi-tech
Et j’te parle pas de Samsung
Si le rap avait du poil
On m’appellerait Samson
Depuis le temps j’ai pris du poids
Je deviens balaise ça me semble
Si le Hip-Hop avait une âme
On m’appellerait Shang Tsung
Malgré tout je suis bien content
Surtout depuis que je chante souvent
Haute-ville Basse-ville
One love Québec All-ville
Ou bien One hate
Quand ça pop comme Orville
Redenbacher
La haine s’infiltre comme un hacker
Ce n’est pas parce qu’ils sont derrière toi
Qu’ils ont ton back up
Tu roules avec tes boys 
Jusqu’à ce que l’un d’eux te vende
Et tu te sens comme Kennedy à Dallas
Un 22 novembre
J’ai 1200 raisons 
De ne plus truster personne
Même seul je tiens mon flag
Comme Lester B. Pearson
But still c’est ride or die
LS jusque dans le hearse son
On vit la vie en live
Et il n’y a pas de rehearsal
Tué à l’ouvrage
Maintenant je sue une couleur sang
J’ai tracé mon sillage
Et il ne passait pas par Orsain
Protège tous mes angles
360 comme un oursin
L’essence d’un rap étrange
Un être hybride comme un ours-singe 

If you could see what we saw
If you knew what we know
If you could walk where we walked
In the dark Everyday
If you don’t know how it goes
Then listen to what we say
Cuz this song is the song
That we live Everyday

Notre lien avec en-haut
Se fait dans de drôles de circonstances
On évite Babylone
Dès qu’on voit le cirque on s’tasse
Ils nous empêchent d’avancer
Comme Katie Bates dans Misery
Avec une bûche entre les jambes
Et deux coups de masse sur les chevilles
Les gros beats ont tuent trop
Mais pourtant on reste discret
Pour tracer leur contour
Il leur faudra au moins 10 craies
Fait le bodycount
Des corps qu’on a laissés sur l’asphalte
Si la musique avait des fesses
La tienne a sûrement un ass flat
Ils visent le palmarès
À la T.I. et Lil’ Flip
Reste qu’on n’est pas comparable
C’est comme un tuba avec une flûte
Comme le Sida avec une grippe
Ou un foulard avec une tuque
Comme un Jedi avec Sith 
Ou Godzilla avec un tigre
Un chinchilla avec un pit
Ou bien des bas avec un slip
Un pain pita avec une frite
Ou l’un de tes bras avec ta …
Est-ce que là où t’habite
Tu vois les mêmes phénomènes
Ici il faut faire ses preuves
L.Land les faits nous mènent

Refrain

À chaque fois qu’on m’entend
Ton boy il dit Amin
Hip-Hop fou commandant
À la Idi Amin
Reste droit devant les tanks
Comme à Tienanmen
Des balls de pétanque
Quand je tire la mine
La nature est la même
Des couilles trempées dans le fer
Crache un rap qui t’écorches 
C’est comme ramper dans le four
Man j’te dis c’est so bad
Même les troupes d’élite chient
Entre les doigts on t’écrase
Comme un fruit un litchi
Et la vérité 
C’est que même assis on run shit
C’est Limoilou autour de la table
C’est comme si on brunchait
Je me fais du rap un festin
Et en déchire la carcasse
Faire face au Destin
C’est comme dans un car crash
Je me rappelle des bars crasses
Où les gens te regardent croche
Une couple de batailles trash
Où on te refait la tronche
L.Land c’est du Hip-Hop
Un moment clé dans nos vies
Garde l’oreille sur le sol
Pour mater la panoplie

Perfeccionabas tu guion

Se que perdi lo que te di why hay
Otra que esta detras de mi 
No llorare un dia mas por ti 
Entre la pasion why el amor 
Hay una fina distincion 
La mentira no la inspira el corazon.

So much more to think about when nothing is in the way
Endless conversation are shaking your head

That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,2003

If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

Y quedara evidencia
De que mis ojos nunca enfocaban
Lo que estaba cerca
Que esta vida tan complicada
Lo complicado lo traigo yo
Hoy reconozco fuiste lo mejor

Pues que me fichen de los locos el peor

Tu ya no estas

Que te he visto llegar
Pues a tu lado que declaro nuestra historia
Comienza Desde Hoy

Quédate un poco mas
Tenemos tanto tiempo recuperar
Se que no he dado suficiente
Que no he amado con la fuerza
Que se debe, como uno debe
Se debe
Y te presento un yeso en blanco Desde Hoy
Te propongo hacer historia Desde Hoy

Y si es de locos escuchar aun tu voz
Que me fichen de los locos el peor
Por mas que digan que aquí
Tu ya no estas
La realidad es que no es hasta ahora
Que te he visto llegar

Si no es sensato escuchar al corazon
Sera que este mundo habrá perdido una razón
Pues nunca he visto todo con mas claridad

Pienso viajar sin equipaje
Sin mucho rodeo
Sin buscarle sentido
Apostando todo en cada instante
Sin mirar atrás, borrando memoria

Necesitamos el silencio para respirar

Hasta que el frio que hoy sentimos
Se convierta en fuego
Hasta que llore el mar
Y el beso que quedo vaco ocupe su lugar

Pasan las tardes sin mirar sin ver
Nos aguantamos el cario
Por no portarnos como niños

Mejor sentarme al borde de tu piel
Que echarle sal a las heridas
De quien mas amo en esta vida

La calma esta por llegar
En cuanto aclare la tormenta
Nos vamos a encontrar

Y aunque otra guerra espera
Yo no me marcho, tu no me dejas

Que pisaste mil tormentas y siempre te has salvado
Solo tuviste que andar solo creer en tus pasos
Eres tú quien sabe más, eres quien saldrá ganando

Silencio de miedos, silencio de planes
Que son posibles, que tienen llave
Si dejas atrás la pregunta de cómo saldrán

Silencio y respuesta, elige el que sea
La que te hace bien, la que no duela
Verás como se abre una puerta
Sólo tienes que entrar, entra

¿Qué día no salió el sol que día no despertaste?
Recuerda cuando creíste perderte y te encontraste
Tan fácil como que vives que sueñas que sabes
Tan tuyo que si tú entras tú también sales

Que son posibles, que tienen llave

Pode ser mais mas sabe menos do que eu.
Porque a vida só se dá pra quem se deu, 
Pra quem amou, pra quem chorou, pra quem sofreu. 

Quem nunca curtiu uma paixão 
Nunca vai ter nada, não. 

Não há mal pior do que a descrença,
Mesmo o amor que não compensa 
É melhor que a solidão. 

Abre os teus braços, meu irmão, deixa cair.
Pra que somar se a gente pode dividir. 
Eu francamente já não quero nem saber 
De quem não vai porque tem medo de sofrer.

Ai de quem não rasga o coração,
Esse não vai ter perdão. 
Quem nunca curtiu uma paixão, 
Nunca vai ter nada, não.

Marilia Mendonça,"Quando eu digo que deixei de te amar
É porque eu te amo
Quando eu digo que não quero mais você
É porque eu te quero
Eu tenho medo de te dar meu coração
E confessar que eu estou em tuas mãos
Mas não posso imaginar
O que vai ser de mim
Se eu te perder um dia

Eu me afasto e me defendo de você
Mas depois me entrego
Faço tipo, falo coisas que eu não sou
Mas depois eu nego
Mas a verdade
É que eu sou louco por você
E tenho medo de pensar em te perder
Eu preciso aceitar que não dá mais
Pra separar as nossas vidas

E nessa loucura de dizer que não te quero
Vou negando as aparências
Disfarçando as evidências
Mas pra que viver fingindo
Se eu não posso enganar meu coração
Eu sei que te amo
Chega de mentiras
De negar o meu desejo
Eu te quero mais que tudo
Eu preciso do seu beijo
Eu entrego a minha vida
Pra você fazer o que quiser de mim
Só quero ouvir você dizer que sim

Diz que é verdade, que tem saudade
Que ainda você pensa muito em mim
Diz que é verdade, que tem saudade
Que ainda você quer viver pra mim",Evidências,2017

Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again

Marillion,"Catalogue princess, apprentice seductress 
Hiding in her cellophane world in glitter town 
Awaiting the prince in his white Capri 
Dynamic young Tarzan courts the bedsit queen 
She's playing the actress in this bedroom scene 
She's learning her lines from glossy magazines 
Stringing all her pearls from her childhood dreams 
Auditioning for the leading role on the silver screen 
Patience my tinsel angel
Patience my perfumed child 
One day they really love you
You'll charm them with that smile 
But for now it's just another Chelsea Monday
Drifting with her incense in the labyrinth of London
Playing games with faces in the neon wonderland
Perform to scattered shadows on the shattered cobbled aisles
Would she dare recite soliloquies at the risk of stark applause
She'll pray for endless Sundays as she enters saffron sunsets 
Conjure phantom lovers from the tattered shreds of dawn
Fulfilled and yet forgotten the St. Tropez mirage 
Fragrant aphrodisiac, the withered tuberose
Patience my tinsel angel, patience my perfumed child
One day they really love you, you'll charm them with that smile
But for now it's just another Chelsea Monday
[Hello John, did you see The Standard about four hours ago? 
Fished a young chick out of The Old Father 
Blond hair, blue eyes. She said she wanted to be an actress or something 
Nobody knows where she came from, where she was going 
Funny thing was she had a smile on her face 
She was smiling, what a waste]

Marillion,"Garden Party held today, invites call the debs to play,
Social climbers polish ladders, wayward sons again have fathers,
Edgy eggs and queing cumbers, rudely wakened from their slumber,
Time has come again for slaughter on the lawns by still Cam waters

Champagne corks are firing at the sun again
Swooping swallows chased by violins again

Straafed by Strauss they sulk in crumbling eaves again
Oh God not again, not again
Apertifs consumed en masse display their owners on the grass
Couples loiter in the cloisters, social leeches quoting Chaucer
Doctor's son a parson's daughter where why not and should they oughta

Please don't lie on the grass, unless accompanied by a fellow,
(May I be so bold as to suggest Othello)
Punting on the Cam is jolly fun they say
Beagling on the downs Oh please come they say
Rugger is the tops a game for men they say

(They say)
Thank God they say
I'm punting, I'm beagling, I'm wining, reclining, I'm rucking, I'm fucking 
So welcome, it's a party 

Angie chalks another blue, mother smiles she did it too
Chitters chat and gossips lash
Posers pose pressmen flash, flash, flash
Smiles polluted with false charm, locking onto Royal arms,
Society columns now ensured, return to mingle with the crowds
Oh what a crowd

Punting on the Cam, oh please do come they say 
Beagling on the downs, oh please so come they say 
Garden party held today they say 
Oh please do come, oh please do come, they say",Garden Party,1983
Marillion,"Midnight suns bid moors farewell, retreats from charging dusk
Mountains echo, curfews bell, signal ending tasks
They place their faith in oaken doors, cower in candlelight
The panic seeps through bloodstained floors as Grendel stalks the night

Earth rim walker seeks his meals
Prepare the funeral pyres
The shapers songs no longer heal the fear
Within their eyes, their eyes

Wooden figures, pagan gods, stare blindly cross the sea
Appeal for help from ocean fogs, for saviors born of dreams
They know their lives are forfeit now, priestly heads they bow in shame
They cannot face the trembling crowd that flinch in Grendel's name

Earth rim walker seeks his meals
Prepare the funeral pyres
The shapers songs no longer heal the fear
Within their eyes, their eyes
Their eyes, their eyes, their eyes

As Grendel leaves his mossy home beneath the stagnant mere
Along the forest path he roams to Hrothgar's hall so clear
He knows that victory is secured, his charm will testify
His claws will drip with mortal blood as moonbeams haunt the sky

As Grendel leaves his mossy home beneath the stagnant mere
Along the forest path he roams to Hrothgar's hall so clear
He knows that victory is secured, his charm will testify
His claws will drip with mortal blood, as moonbeams haunt the sky

Earth rim walker seeks his meals
Prepare the funeral pyres
The shapers songs no longer heal the fear
Within their hearts, within their hearts
Within their hearts, within their eyes

Silken membranes span his path, fingerprints in dew
Denizens of twilight lands humbly beg him through
Mother nature's bastard child, shunned by leaf and stream
An alien in an alien land, seeks solace within dreams

The shapers lies his poisoned tongue malign with mocking harp
Beguiling queen, her innocence offends his icy heart

Hounds freeze in silence bewitched by the reptile spell
Sulfurous essence pervades 'round the grassy dell
Heorot awaits him like lamb to the butcher's knife
Stellular heavens ignore even children's cries

Screams are his music, lightning his guide
Raping the darkness, death by his side

Chants rise in terror, free round the oaken beams
Flickering firelight portraying the grisly scene
Warriors advance, prepare for the nightmare foe
Futile their sacrifice as even their hearts must know

Heroes delusions with feet in the grave
Lurker at the threshold
He cares not for the brave
He cares not for the brave

So you thought that your bolts and your locks would keep me out
You should have known better after all this time
You're gonna pay in blood for all your vicious slander
With your ugly pale skins and your putrid blue eyes

Why should I feel pity when you kill your own and feel no shame?
God's on my side, sure as hell, I'm gonna take no blame
I'm gonna take no blame, I'm goin' to take no blame

So you say you believe in all of mother nature's laws
You lust for gold with your sharpened knives
Ooh, when your hoards are gathered and your enemies left to rot
You pray with your bloodstained hands at the feet of your pagan gods

Then you try to place the killers blade in my hand
You call for justice and distort the truth
Well, I've had enough of all your pretty, pretty speeches
Receive your punishment, expose your throats to my righteous claws
And let the blood flow, and let the blood flow, and let the blood flow
And let the blood flow, and let the blood flow

Let the blood flow, let the blood flow
Let the blood flow, let the blood flow, let the blood flow, flow, flow
Let the blood flow, let the blood flow
Let the blood flow, let the blood flow, flow, flow

Marillion,"We are jigsaw pieces aligned on the perimeter edge,
Intelocked through a missing piece.
We are Renaissance children becalmed beneath the bridge of sighs,
Forever throwing firebrands at the stonework.

We are Siamese children related by the heart,
Bleeding from the surgery of initial confrontation,
Holding the word scalpels on trembling lips.

Stand straight, look me in the eye and say goodbye, say goodbye.
Stand straight, we've drifted past the point of reasons why.
Yesterday starts tomorrow, tomorrow starts today,
The problems always seem to be, we're picking up the pieces on the ricochet.
This is the ricochet...

Drowning Tequila sunsets, stowaways on midnight ships,
Refugees of romance plead asylum from the real.
Scrambling distress signals on random frequencies,
Forever repatriated on guilt laden morning planes.

We are pilots of passion sweating the flight on course
To another summit conference, another breakfast time divorce,
Screaming out a ceasefire, snowblind in an avalanche zone.

Stand straight, look me in the eye and say goodbye, say goodbye.
Stand straight, we've drifted past the point of reasons why.
Yesterday starts tomorrow, tomorrow starts today,
The problems always seem to be, we're picking up the pieces on the ricochet.
This is the ricochet...

Are we trigger happy, happy, happy?
Russian roulette in the waiting room,
Empty chambers embracing the end.
Puzzled visions haunt the ripples of a trevi moon,

Dream coins for the fountain or to cover your eyes.
We reached ignition point from the sparks of pleasantries,
We sensed the smoke advancing from horizons,
You must have known that I was planning, considering an escape.

Stand straight, look me in the eye and say goodbye, say goodbye.
Stand straight, we've drifted past the point of reasons why.
Yesterday starts tomorrow, tomorrow starts today,
And the problems always seem to be,
We're picking up the pieces on the ricochet.

Curling tongs, mogadons, I got a headache baby, don't take so long
Single beds, middle age dread
Losing the war in the waistlands spread

Who left the cap of the toothpaste tube
Who forgot to flush the loo
Leave your sweaty socks outside the door
Don't walk across my polished floor, oh Judy

Whatever happened to morning smiles
Whatever happened to wicked wiles, permissive styles
Whatever happened to twinkling eyes
Whatever happened to hard fast drives
Complements on unnatural size

Marillion,"I am the assassin, with tongue forged from eloquence 
I am the assassin, providing your nemesis 
On the sacrificial altar to success, my friend
Unleash a stranger from a kiss, my friend
No incantations of remorse, my friend
Unsheathe the blade within the voice, my friend
Who decorates the scarf with the fugi knot 
Who camouflaged emotion in a thousand yard stare
Who gouged the notches from the family tree 
Who hypnotised the guilt in career rhythm trance
Assassing, assassing, assassing, assassing
Listen as the syllables of slaughter cat with calm precision 
Patterned frosty phrases rape your ears and sow the ice incision 
Apocalyptic alphabet casting spell the creed of tempered diction 
Adjectives of annihilation bury the point beyond redemption 
Venomous verbs of ruthless candour plagiarise assassins fervour 
A friend in need is a friend that bleeds
Let bitter silence infect the wound
You were a sentimental mercenary in a free fire zone 
Parading a Hollywood conscience 
You were a fashionable objector with a uniform fetish
Pavlovian slaver at the cash till ring of success 
A non com observer - I assassin the collector - defector 
So you resigned yourself to failure, my friend
And I emerged the chilling stranger, my friend
To eradicate the problem, my friend
Unsheathe the blade within the voice
I am the assassin
I am the assassin
And what do you call assassins who accuse assassins anyway, my friend?",Assassing,1984
Marillion,"To be the prince of possession in the gallery of contempt
Suffering your indiscreet discretions and you ask me to relent 
As you accumulate flirtations with the calculated calmness of the whore
I am the harlequin - diamonded costume dripping shades of green 
I am the harlequin - sense strangers violate my sanctuary
Prowl my dreams 
Plundering your diaries, I'll steal your thoughts innocence
Ravaging your letters, unearth your plots innocence 
To don the robes of Torquemada, resurrect the inquisition
In that tortured subtle manner inflict questions within questions
Looking in shades of green through shades of blue
I trust you trust in me to mistrust you
Through the Silk Cut haze to the smeared mascara 
A 40 watt sun on a courtroom drama
And the coffee stains gather till the pale kimono 
Set the wedding rings dancing on the cold linoleum
And accusations moths that circle on the light 
Char their wings and spiral senseless suicidal flight
You packed your world within a suitcase, hot tears melt this icy palace
Dissolve a crystal swallowed by the night
Looking in shades of green through shades of blue
Looking in shades of green through shades of blue

Marillion,"When footlights dim in reverence to prescient passion forewarned
My audience leaves the stage, floating ahead perfumed shift
Within the stammering silence, the face that launched a thousand frames
Betrayed by a porcelain tear, a stained career

You played this scene before, you played this scene before
I the mote in your eye, I the mote in your eye
A misplaced reaction

The darkroom unleashes imagination in pornographic images
In which you will always be the star, always be the star, untouchable
Unapproachable, constant in the darkness
Nursing an erection, a misplaced reaction
With no flower to place before this gravestone
And the walls become enticingly newspaper thin
But that would be developing the negative view
And you have to be exposed in voyeuristic colour
The public act, let you model your shame
On the mannequin catwalk, catwalk
Let the cats walk, and the cat walks

I've played this scene before, I've played this scene before
I the mote in your eye, I the mote in your eye
A misplaced reaction, satisfaction

You can't brush me under the carpet, you can't hide me under the stairs
The custodian of your private fears, your leading actor of yesteryear
Who as you crawled out of the alleys of obscurity
Sentenced to rejection in the morass of anonymity
You who I directed with lovers will, you who I let hypnotise the lens
You who I let bathe in the spotlights glare
You who wiped me from your memory like a greasepaint mask
Just like a greasepaint mask

But now I'm the snake in the grass, the ghost of film reels past
I'm the producer of your nightmare and the performance has just begun
It's just begun

Your perimeter of courtiers jerk like celluloid puppets
As you stutter paralysed with rabbits eyes, searing the shadows
Flooding the wings, to pluck elusive salvation from the understudy's lips
Retrieve the soliloquy, maintain the obituary
My cue line in the last act and you wait in silent solitude
Waiting for the prompt, waiting for the prompt

You've played this scene before",Incubus,1984

Extinguishing the fires in a private hell
Provoking the heartache to renew the licence
Of a bleeding heart poet in a fragile capsule
Propping up the crust of the glitter conscience
Wrapped in the christening shawl of a hangover
Baptised in the tears from the real
Drowning in the liquid seize on the Piccadilly line, rat race
Scuttling through the damp electric labyrinth
Caress Ophelia's hand with breathstroke ambition
An albatross in the marrytime tradition
Sheathed within the Walkman wear the halo of distortion
Aural contraceptive aborting pregnant conversation
She turned the harpoon and it pierced my heart
She hung herself around my neck
From the Time-Life-Guardians in their conscience bubbles
Safe and dry in my sea of troubles
Nine to five with suitable ties
Cast adrift as their side-show, peepshow, stereo hero
Becalm bestill, bewitch, drowning in the real
The thief of Baghdad hides in Islington now
Praying deportation for his sacred cow
A legacy of romance from a twilight world
The dowry of a relative mystery girl
A Vietnamese flower, a Dockland union
A mistress of release from a magazine's thighs
Magdalenes contracts more than favours
The feeding hands of western promise hold her by the throat
A son of a swastika of '45 parading a peroxide standard
Graffiti conjure disciples testaments of hatred
Aerosol wands whisper where the searchlights trim the barbed wire hedges
This is Brixton chess
A knight for Embankment folds his newspaper castle
A creature of habit, begs the boatman's coin
He'll fade with old soldiers in the grease stained roll call
And linger with the heartburn of Good Friday's last supper
Son watches father scan obituary columns in search of absent school friends
While his generation digests high fibre ignorance
Cowering behind curtains and the taped up painted windows
Decriminalised genocide, provided door to door Belsens
Pandora's box of holocausts gracefully cruising satellite infested heavens
Waiting, the season of the button, the penultimate migration
Radioactive perfumes, for the fashionably, for the terminally insane, insane

To bleed the lyric for this song to write the rites to right my wrongs 
An epitaph to a broken dream to exercise this silent scream 
A scream that's borne from sorrow 
I never did write that love song, the words just never seemed to flow
Now sad in reflection did I gaze through perfection 
And examine the shadows on the other side of the morning 
And examine the shadows on the other side of mourning 
Promised wedding now a wake
The fool escaped from paradise will look over his shoulder and cry 
Sit and chew on daffodils and struggle to answer why?
As you grow up and leave the playground 
Where you kissed your prince and found your frog
Remember the jester that showed you tears, the script for tears 
So I'll hold our peace forever when you wear your bridal gown 
In the silence of my shame the mute that sang the sirens' song 
Has gone solo in the game, I've gone solo in the game

Marillion,"At that time of the night 
When streetlights throw crosses through window frames 
Paranoia roams where the shadows reign 
Oh, at that time of the night 

At that time of the night 
Your senses tangled in some new perfume 
Criticism triggers of a loaded room 
Oh, at that time of the night 

So if you ask me 
How do I feel inside 
I could honestly tell you 
We've been taken on a very long ride 
And if my owners let me have some free time some day 
With all good intention I would probably run away 
Clutching the short straw 

At that time of the night 
When questions rally in an open mind 
Summon all your answers with an ice cubes chime 
At that time of the night 

At that time of the night 
Pretend you're off the hook with the telephone 
Your confidence wounded in a free fire zone 
Oh, at that time of the night 

So if you ask me 
Where do I go from here 
My next destination even isn't really that clear 
So if you join me and get on your knees and pray 
I'll show you salvation 
We'll take the alternative way 
Clutching the short straw 

If I had enough money I'd buy a round for that boy over there 
A companion in my madness in the mirror the one with the silvery hair 
And if some kind soul could please pick up my tab 
And while they're at it if they could pick up my broken heart.

Something about roman candles fizzing out, shine a little light on me now
Found a strange fascination with a liquid fixation, alcohol can thrill me now
It's getting late in the game to show any pride or shame
I just burn a little brighter now, burn a little brighter now

Doctor says my liver looks like leaving with my lover, need another time-out now
Like any sort of hero turning down to zero still standing out in any crowd

Pulling seventeen with experience and dreams, sweating out a happy hour
Where you're hiding 29 you know it ain't a crime
To burn a little brighter now, burn a little brighter now

The stony flowers and the matching graffiti were guiding me
To the steps inside of me

And what would you do if I got down on my knees to you?
What would you do if I lied to your face?
Could you still hold your dreams?
Could you live with your silent face?

So what would you do, would you walk right through me?
Would you stand in the way like the others before?
Get in the way
Would you drink to me next Beaujolais day?

Tell me the truth, save a prayer for me
I would love to leave you but you would cry all night long
Eternal romantic victory failed on Beaujolais day

I heard a wheelchair whisper across a stale silent gymnasium
Trailing an ivy league jacket like a matador
Through the jitterbug steps of the night before

Through the chalk white chill and the tear fandango
Heading away to the inner wrangle
Do we cry for a cell?
Do we need for a cell?

What would you do, would you cry for me?
Could you set off, could we go gently?
Blame it away
Do you really want to head for the open door?

Got to crack a bottle while you dream for me
Just an absent friend and a misery
Laying awake do we stay right there
'Til Beaujolais day, on Beaujolais day

So what would you do, would you lie to me?
Would you sit right back in a victory?
Would you play for me?
Could you die for me?

And noses in his private affairs

Earth rim walker seeks his meals
Prepare the funeral pyres
The shaper's songs no longer heal the fear
Within their eyes, their eyes

Wooden figures, pagan gods, stare blindly cross the sea
Appeal for help from ocean fogs, for saviour born of dreams
They know their lives are forfeit now, priestly head they bow in shame
They cannot face the trembling crowd that flinch in Grendel's name

The shaper's songs no longer heal the fear

As Grendel leaves his mossy home beneath the stagnant mere
Along the forest path he roams to Hrothgar's hall so clear
He knows that victory is secured, his charm will testify
His claws will drip with mortal blood as moonbeams haunt the sky

Earth rim walker seeks his meals
Prepare the funeral pyres
The shaper's songs no longer heal the fear
Within their eyes, their eyes

Denizens of twilight lands humbly beg him through
Mother nature's bastard child shunned by leaf and stream
An alien in an alien land seeks solace within dreams
The shaper's lies his poisoned tongue malign with mocking harp
Beguiling queen her innocence offends his icy heart


Hounds freeze in silence bewitched by the reptile spell
Sulphurous essence pervades round the grassy dell
Heorot awaits him like lamb to the butcher's knife
Stellular heavens ignore even children's cries

Screams are his music, lightning his guide
Raping the darkness, death by his side

Chants rise in terror, free round the oaken beams
Flickering firelight portraying the grisly scene
Warriors advance, prepare for the nightmare foe
Futile their sacrifice as even their hearts must know

Heroes delusion, with feet in the grave
Lurker at the threshold, he cares not for the brave, he cares not for the brave

So you thought that your bolts and your locks would keep me out
You should have known better after all this time
You're gonna pay in blood for all your vicious slander
With your ugly pale skins and your putrid blue eyes
Why should I feel pity when you kill your own and feel no shame
God's on my side, sure as hell, I'm gonna take no blame
I'm gonna take no blame, I'm gonna take no blame

So you say you believe in all of Mother Nature's laws
You lust for gold with your sharpened knives
Oh when your hoards are gathered and your enemies left to rot
You pray with your bloodstained hands at the feet of your pagan gods

Then you try to place the killer's blade in my hand
You call for justice and distort the truth

That I thought had disappeared

And I saw a magpie in the rainbow

More than surprised
To find the answers to the questions
Were always in your own eyes

Do you realize
That you give it on back to her?
But that would only be retraced
In all the problems that you ever knew, so untrue

With her life
And you've got to carry on
With yours

Now you've arrived

You've found the leading light of destiny
Burning in the ashes of your memory
You wanna change the world

To die a broken rebel
But that was looking backward

While I sit tied to the phone like an expectant father

Her daddy said, ""A whore"".

The sky was Bible black in Lyon
When I met the Magdalene
She was paralyzed in a streetlight
She refused to give her name

And a ring of violet bruises
They were pinned upon her arm.
Two hundred francs for sanctuary and she led me by the hand
To a room of dancing shadows where all the heartache disappears
And from glowing tongues of candles I heard her whisper in my ear
""'J'entend ton coeur""
I can hear your heart

It's getting late, for scribbling and scratching on the paper
Something's gonna give under this pressure
And the cracks are already beginning to show
It's too late
The weekend career girl never boarded the plane
They said this could never happen again
So wrong, so wrong

This time it seems to be another misplaced rendezvous
This time, it's looking like another misplaced rendezvous
With you
The parallel of you, yo

On the outskirts of nowhere
On the ring road to somewhere
On the verge of indecision
I'll always take the roundabout way
Waiting on the rain
For I was born with a habit, from a sign
The habit of a windswept thumb
And the sign of the rain
It's started raining",Bitter Suite,1988
Marillion,"When the taxis gather in mock Solemnity
Funeral hearses court the death of virginity
Was it paradise lost or paradise found?
Did we gain respect or were we holding ground? 
You had found true love, or so you believed
And the wide boys tattooed your hearts upon their sleeves 
So when you think it's time to go
When you think it's time to go
Don't be surprised, the heroes never show

And the patter merchants selling false impressions
Tipping eyes at the waitress with American expressions
Tie angels to the bar with sweet Martini's and their charms
They're lying on every word and every arm 
They're turning down their noses to the best lines
And the cheap wines

And the wide boys
They wear their love bites for their crimes",Waterhole (Expresso Bongo),1988
Marillion,"There's a line on her jeans that a ball-point made
From a careless mistake that she can't wash away
And there's a heart on her sleeve from a spill of red wine
There's a piece of green in the blue of her eyes
She named it after me

There's a stray dog she feeds that she found in the street
And he loves her to hold him, but he won't let her keep him
And he claws at the door to be let out at night
And she makes do without him, and she worries about him
She named him after me

So if you ever decide that you have to escape
And travel the world, and you can't find a place
Well, you could wind up believing
That paradise is nothing more than a feeling
That goes on in your mind
So if ever find out what that is
There's something you could do

'Cause if I ever hold that golden dream again
I want to tell you
I'm gonna name it after you",After Me,1989
Marillion,"The mascara'd blonde from the Berliner bar
Rises at twilight, gets dressed in a daze
Black leather crackles and cold water runs
As she touches the walls of memory maze

And the shadows of men she has known fill her day
She's held half the world in her arms so they say
But she wakes up without them with a hole in her heart
And she puts on her clothes lives her life behind bars

Dancing in the spotlight to the sound of clapping hands
Nobody knows who's side he was on
It's a risk that you take in no man's land
Nobody knows what made him decide
To run for freedom and to certain suicide
When they turn off the guns and his fingers uncurl
He's clutching a photograph of a Berlin party girl

Come in from your checkpoints on your lonely roads
Come in from your ditches in your silent fields
Where intensified light from a rifle sight
Makes the darkness day
And the day too bright,

And we wake up without you
We wake up without you
With a hole in our hearts

You mad dog shaven head bottle-boy freaks
In Martens and khaki, drunk on sake
You stare at yourself in the cruel flush of dawn
Terrified, sunken eyed, withered and drawn
The butcher, the baker, the munitions maker
The over-achiever, the armistice breaker
The freebase instructor, the lightning conductor
The psycho, the sailor, the tanker, the tailor
The black market mailer

A cog in the hurrying world

For proof you were right all along

The truth gets so disguised
In a kingdom built on madness and on lies

One day, freedom will unlock your door
So hold on, believe on
Be who you were before
In deepest darkness, the faintest light looks bright
So hold on, hold on
It's gonna be all right

Between you and the outside

A puppet king on the fourth of June
And butterflies from all around
Settled on his paper crown

An avenue of eternal peace
But he said, ""What is here can soon burn down...""
""I'm the king of Sunset Town.""

Some go up, and some go down
Some go thirsty, some just drown
""That's the law 'round here,""

And the square becomes a battlefield
Of staring eyes that can't explain
The insanity and the greater game

Some go up, and some go down
Some go thirsty, some just drown
""That's the law 'round here,""

The corridors of this white place
And as he lay his body down

I saw the scars that lined his face
And injured souls came to his bed
To hear the stories he would tell
Of butterflies and summertimes

And everyone assembled here
Remembers how it used to be
Before the twenty-seventh came
This place will never be the same

I heard somebody say
That it might never snow again
In England

Snow flakes in a new-born fist
Sledging on a hill
Are these things we'll never see
In England

We'll tell our children's children why
We grew so tall and reached so high
We left our footprints in the earth
And punched a hole right through the sky

We'll tell them how we changed the world
And how we tamed the sea
And seasons they will never know

Feeling so high you can feel so alone
Unable to breathe at the height that you flew

Falling towards something out of control
Unable to miss like the man in the tram
Crashing your car in Amsterdam

He did it without knowing, didn't feel a thing
He just wrecked it and kept going

In the sunken bones of a broken ship
On the shadow line where whispers creep
To the world above from the world beneath

On waves of silver I dreamed of gold
Till I lost the peace that dreaming gives
I dreamed of the moment of my own death
That no one ever dreams and lives

I dreamed I sailed to the mirrored edge
Of that murky world for an iron bell
That dragged me down to the ocean bed 
And rang to mark where my shadow fell

Till I lost the peace that dreaming gives
I dreamed of the moment of my own death 
That no one ever dreams and lives 

That no one ever dreams and lives

I dreamed I slept on the ocean bed 
And a silent grave of silver sand 

Rolled in the sway of an iron bell

She tolls for the mourning of her own death

They move silently on their greasy wheels

This town hangs around in the doorway and tells me I'm late

From the shop on the corner 
They didn't stop her 
Thought she was older
She took a bus ride 
To a name and a number 
A house full of music 
And a hat full of wonder
And some of the people that 
She thought that she knew 
Were never like this 
When she saw them at school 
She's never been anywhere like this before 
Everybody's so out of control
She was in a backroom 
Full of strange aromas
And noises and candles
That was where he found her
He took her to a garden
Full of rain and silence
And she could smell the soil and the trees 
And see the succulent light 
From the little fires in his eyes 
Pulling shapes out of the night 
She was enchanted....
Then it's twelve o'clock 
And the last bus is gone 
They're gonna go crazy when 
They hear what she's done 
And higher is lower 
And less is like more

Rolled from stolen lipsticks across the razored webs of glass 

Sharing cigarettes with experience with her giggling jealous confidantes
She faithfully traces his name with quick bitten fingernails 
Through the tears of condensation that'll cry through the night 
As the glancing headlights of the last bus kiss adolescence goodbye

Like a mothers kiss on your first broken heart, a warm wet circle 
Like a bullet hole in Central Park, a warm wet circle

In a life I used to live
But I have never seen these streets so fresh
Washed with morning rain

I have seen this face a thousand times
Every morning of my life
But I never saw these eyes so clear
Free of doubt and pain

Like the whole world has been made again

I have been here many times before
In a life I used to live...

And it's all because you made me see
What is false and what is true
Like the inside and the outside of me
Is being made again by you

And it's all because you made me see
What is false and what is true
Like the inside and the outside of me
Has been made again by you

Like a bright new morning
Like a bright new day
I woke up from a deep sleep
I woke up from a bad dream

To a brand new morning
To a brand new day
Like the whole world has been made again

As I shine on the outside more these days 
I can feel the outside feeding on my inside 
'Leaves a growing darkness in it's place

I think I have become one of the hollow men
I think I have become one of the lonely
Now that everybody talks to me
I feel I have become one of the empty

Hollow men can stop you with the twinkling of an eye
Hollow men can take you without even reaching out 
Hollow men have got you long before you realise 
The poison paralyses

I think I have become one of a pair of men
It's a feeling I've been having for some time
I look down upon myself and watch my movements 
A blind eye sees the fragile vandalised

Watch this cold world dishing up these endless hollow men
Find us anywhere you look 
Come and meet our friends 
Stand us in our silly clothes 
Put our batteries in
Line us up like fairground ducks 
Watch us grin and grin 
See the lies behind our eyes ... 
See the will to win 
We'll buy you and we'll sell you
But perhaps we'll save your skin ...

Sit quietly and listen to the breeze ... 
The hollow and the lonely listen too 
Sniff the air for something we can use

We're thin hard and we rattle when we're shaken 

",The Hollow Man [Acoustic],1994
Marillion,"It all began with the bright light 
The bright light and the noise
The chaos of the senses and the scream of desire

Touching and being touched 
A million loose ends to tie up
Ticking of the clock and the cradle rock

The colours stand still
And then they move around 
Comin' in and out of focus upside down

Empty winter trees
How space feels Love of the soft ... flowers and the sky

One fine day 
The chaos subsides
Bleeds into awareness
And a lifetime of surprise

The beauty of your mother's eyes
The pain when you fall 
You drink it in and marvel at it all 
But you never really figure it out

You get used to it

The babble of the family 
And the dumb TV 
Roar of the traffic and the thunder of jets

Chemicals in the water
Drugs in the food 
The heat of the kitchen and the beat of the system

The attitude of authority 
The laws and the rules 
Hit me square in the face, first morning at school

The heroes and the zeroes 
The first love of my life 
When to kiss and to kick and to keep your head down when they're choosing the sides
I was never any good at it 
I was terrified most of the time
I never got over it 
I got used to it

Alone in the city at seventeen 
With the hollow, the lonely 
The drowning and the drowned 
I was made to feel worthless 
The wretched and the mean 
Beat me up like a weapon 
I can't run away from or find a way round 
Holdin' on, holdin' on

The greed and the missiles
Exploding somewhere every day 
Hideous dark secrets under the sea and in holes in the ground

The cold war's gone 
Those bastards'll find us another one
They're here to protect you, don't you know? 
So get used to it Get used to it!

The clash of religions 
The loaded prayers 
Information 
The face of starvation and the state of the nation

The sense that it's useless 
And the fear to try 
Not believing the leaders, the media that feeds us 
Living with the big lie

You get used to it

And was the runaway girl all they could see ...
A teenage extra from the satellite TV
Runaway girl
Too bad, too bad

Too wild, too wild
Were they deaf to the prayer behind your lies
Maybe they didn't dare to ask you why 
Was a runaway girl all they chose to see 
All they were prepared to admit to

Too bad, too bad

You pretend to wait for washing in some Laundromat 
But you're damned if you'll give them the satisfaction of you going back
You'd freeze to death before you'd share a roof with them 
And you'd starve before you'd let him get his hands on you again

And her wet hair hugged her body like a long-lost friend
And I really tried my best to get across to her
But nothing she would say could be defended

Well her birthday suit it was her only present
When I looked into her eyes - no history
And I told her eating people wasn't pleasant
But she laughed a snake eye laugh and walked away from me

And I watched her as she walked across the coals
I watched her as she walked across the coals

And I'm your nightmare surfer babe
Mr. Wilson where's your sandbox and your beard
'You still looking for the perfect microwave?

So I really did my best to get across to her
I said: ""One day every pebble hits the beach""
And I kissed her face and held her like a long-lost friend

Mr. Wilson where's your sandbox and your beard

And the sun came up over the mountain
And the waves rolled in across the bay
And the fabulous brightly-coloured birds flew up out of the forest
And she said ""Well we're all heaven's beautiful children living together in paradise
Lie down my dear... you're going to enjoy this""

And she looked like she'd had sex
With a Tyrannosaurus Rex

Singing: I was born in nineteen sixty weird, old man
I'm your nightmare surfer babe
Mr. Wilson where's your sandbox and your beard
'You still looking for that perfect microwave?
Perfect microwave

And I watched her as she walked across the coals...

Marillion,"Saw you walking on your velvet lawn
Is it lonely on the moon? 
You took a dive and swallowed all you could 
Did you drink too much too soon? 
Nothing left for you to fight about 
And no one wants to see you try 
The nearest neighbours are a mile away
Does the ocean hear you cry? 

Punching at the sky 
They say the King is losin´ his grip again
They said you´re bullet proof, they said you feel no pain 
It seems the hero is misunderstood again 

Is it love or is it surgery 
Makes her seem so ill at ease
As she´s begging you to please calm down
In her silk Armani on her knees

Did you carry out those threats I heard 
Or were you only playing macho?
And the stains on her Versace scarf
Were they really just Gazpacho? 

They say the King is watching his back again
They say the King is losing his grip again 
Raging like a bull to an empty ring 
D´you think they will forgive a hero anything?

Now the ring is just a band of gold 
And your wife needs police protection 
While you´re sparring with the journalists 
You´re trying to win back her affection 
Is this what it means to be a man 
Boxing up all your emotion
So now she´s gone and you´re alone at last
You can tell it to the ocean 

They say the King is losing his grip again 
They say the King is countin´ his numbered days
You never lost a fight in your whole life 
You never had no trouble sleepin´ through the night 
The bottle and the doctor get you through the day
The boys who run the house´ll make it all okay

Maybe Hollywood
But maybe then again

I look down upon myself and watch my movements
A blind eye sees the fragile vandalised

Watch this cold world dishing up these endless hollow men
Find us anywhere you look
Come and meet our friends
Stand us in our silly clothes
Put our batteries in
Line us up like fairground ducks
Watch us grin and grin
See the lies behind our eyes
See the will to win
We'll buy you and we'll sell you
But perhaps we'll save your skin

Sit quietly and listen to the breeze
The hollow and the lonely listen too
Sniff the air for something we can use

We're tin-hard and we rattle when we're shaken",Hollow Man,1996
Marillion,"How long can you stand
Tightening up
Avoiding the fight
Avoiding the truth
Tighten the smile
Tighten the lie
Will you get what you want
To be cursed with your dreams
I hope for your sake
Something gets in the way

How long can you stand
Living under the lens
The kiss of success
The ensuing, all consuming, mess

Message of love
They arrive everyday
People you touch
Wasting away
People you don't know
Give you no choice

And you're sick to your stomach
At the sound of your voice
And the shape of your face
And the sound of your name
They send you pictures of yourself
It's someone you don't know
And they call you a genius
Cause you're easier to sell
But the fire in your belly
That gave you the songs
Is suddenly gone
And you feel like a fake
Is that what you want?

I hope for your sake
You've got what it takes
You've got what it takes
To be spoilt to death.",King,1996
Marillion,"Just when I thought I'd seen the last of you
You come here scratchin' at my door
Your pain and anger's in the howling dark
Of every corridor I walk

So tell me more about the love that you rejected
Tell me more about the trust you disrespected
I still don't know, why did you hurt the very one?
Why did you hurt the very one that you should have protected?",The Last of You,1996
Marillion,"It all began with the bright light
The bright light and the noise
The chaos of the senses and the scream of desire

Touching and being touched
A million loose ends to tie up
Ticking of the clock and the cradle rock

The colours stand still
And then they move around
Comin' in and out of focus upside down

Empty winter trees
How space feels
Love of the soft ... the flowers and the sky

One fine day
The chaos subsides
Bleeds into awareness
And a lifetime of surprise

The beauty of your mothers eyes
The pain when you fall
You drink it in and marvel at it all
But you never really figure it out

You get used to it

The babble of the family
And the dumb TV
Roar of the traffic and the thunder of jets

Chemicals in the water
Drugs in the food
The heat of the kitchen and the beat of the system

The attitude of authority
The laws and the rules
Hit me square in the face, first morning at school

The heroes and the zeroes
The first love of my life
When to kiss and to kick and to keep your head down
When they're choosing the sides

I was never any good at it
I was terrified most of the time
I never got over it

I got used to it

Alone in the city at seventeen
With the hollow and the lonely
The drowning and the drowned
I was made to feel worthless
The wretched and the mean
Beat me up like a weapon I can't run away from or find a way round

Holdin' on, holdin' on

The greed and the missiles
Exploding somewhere every day
Hideous dark secrets under the sea and in holes in the ground

The cold war's gone
But those bastards'll find us another one
They're here to protect you, don't you know?
So get used to it
Get used to it!

The clash of religions
And the loaded prayers
Information
The face of starvation and the state of the nation

The sense that it's useless
And the fear to try
Not believing the leaders, the media that feed us
Living with the big lie

You get used to it
Get used to it!
It's okay, I got used to it",Living With the Big Lie,1996

Burn me in the fires of wild heaven

Or was it something I said?

Marillion,"There was a boy who came into this world
At the hands of a holy woman in a holy place
He wore a red coat and walked a bulldog
Saw them reflected in the mirror of the lakes
Lived in the shadow of the mountains
With the smells of disinfectant, dusty old leather
And the polished wood of his bed
No more than a baby feeding swans on the river
Holding the hands of his mother
And the wax paper bag of yesterday's bread

And his father on the other side of the world
On the ships railings and some far away tide
With the silent dry tear of home thoughts from abroad
In his far away eyes
In his far away eyes

The smell of the wax on the wooden floor
Mixture of polish and soap
No children to fear or to play with
Rows of empty hooks for the coats
An upright piano and the boys in the choir
Still remind him of just before he was born
Remind him of just before he was breathing
Strange misty visions of God
Turn the cities into families
Into villages of souls
Hovering in the air while they're sleeping
With their houses invisible
Chase the moon between the buildings
Running as fast as I could run
Send to me the ghosts of Christmas
Whispering, ""You're the only one""

And ever since I was a boy
I never felt that I belonged
Like everything they did to me
Was an experiment to see
How I would cope with the illusion
In which direction would I jump
Would I do it all the same
As the actors in the game
Or would I spit it back at them
And not get caught up in their rules
And live according to my own
And not be used, not be used
To find the fundamental truths
It was going to take some time
Thirty five summers down the line
The wisdom of each passing year
Seems to serve only to confuse
Seems to serve only to confuse

Daddy came out the navy and took us away
To his dirty grey home town
And he worked down on a coal mine for National Service
So that he could be around
There was a magical purple in the chrome of the exhaust
Of his Triumph motor bike
And a warmth of oil and metal and the thrill of the hard corner
Holding tight

From the horizon
Came home from the Navy to the mine
From the horizon
To buried alive
Took his dream underground
Buried his treasure in his faraway eyes

And one day as the boy lay sleeping in the sunshine
Of a half remembered afternoon
A cloud of bees with no particular aim, and no brain
Found the boy, decided that his time had come
Came down out of the sky
Stung him in the face
Again and again
Blue pain
Screaming like baptism
Intravenous, Jesus!
Like being chosen
Blue pain from something with no brain
I can't explain
It's happening again
It's happening again

Oh Mummy, Daddy, will you sit a while with me
Oh Mummy, Daddy, will you jog my memory
Tell me tall tales of Montego Bay
Table mountain, flying fish, banana spiders, pots of paint
And the sun on the equator
Setting like an ember thrown to deep water
From crimson to black
But coming back
Tomorrow
On the horizon

The blue pain
Fades to a point where it doesn't fade
It stayed
Blue
Stirred his red coat heart to this strange engine
This love

This love
This inconvenient, blind, blood-diamond
This puzzle
I don't understand
That knows no faith
And tries and fails
And tries again
Stares at the sea
The night's dark deep
For one last time
And bleeds
And bleeds
And dies for you
And lies
And is to blame
And is ashamed
And is not the same
And is true
And is true",This Strange Engine,1997

In the parks and the old town
I came with a mission 
To patch up a dream 
We walked and I talked and my words were absorbed
Into the answering machine 

I came two thousand miles
Just to take a look at you
But you were broken and frozen 
A heartbreak of a statue 
In the bullet-proof mirrors 
Where your eyes used to be 
I stared at myself and I called for some help 
Into the answering machine

The day slipped by and I tried and tried 
You took me home and you said
""Goodnight, Sleep tight"" 
On the floor by the bedroom door 
I watched you sleep and I left before first light

To the land of the low

But we were always alone

Echoes silently around the cold grey places 
Ecstasies undared 
Tremble upon the edge of the tightly, respectably unfulfilled

Well dressed ordered minds on suicide's edge
Reflected in the rain-skimmed slate grey, battleship grey, hardship grey

[Blue grey]

And further South, and homeless
Here I am
Globally altered and dishevelled

And yet bound together and hopelessly in love
With the inevitable loss 
And the end

She measured up 
They moved into a basement

Hurting in a different way
Hurting in a different way 

I still have the hi-fi 
Quiet at all volumes 
As my dull thoughts 
Echo viscous and slow like the tolling of some great bell under water 

When she cries she cuts me 
And when she smiles I want to die 
Afraid of knowing myself 
Our eyes stare out while we hide inside 

Looking at it, not seeing it
Looking at it, not seeing it 

The open windows 
Let in the spring air today
And the birds sing their thankfully happy, brainless song 
But the silence here finds a way to stay 
Some kind of explosion
God, if you hear me 
Throw me a line or strike me down 
Do you refuse even to accuse 
c'mon, do your worst 
But lift this curse 

Built this house on solid ground
But now it's crumbling tumbling down
Will nobody here even cry out for help?
As it slowly collapses into itself 

Looking at it, not seeing it
Looking at it, not seeing it 

Hanging on to this pain 
It's no good 
It's no good 

But we try again 

We try again",House,1999

We rejoice at being ""connected""

Hit me square in the face, first morning at school

The heroes and the zeroes
The first love of my life
When to kiss and to kick and to keep your head down
When they're choosing the sides

I was never any good at it
I was terrified most of the time
I never got over it

I got used to it

Alone in the city at seventeen
With the hollow and the lonely
The drowning and the drowned
I was made to feel worthless
The wretched and the mean
Beat me up like a weapon I can't run away from or find a way round

Holdin' on, holdin' on

The greed and the missiles
Exploding somewhere every day
Hideous dark secrets under the sea and in holes in the ground

The cold war's gone
But those bastards'll find us another one
They're here to protect you, don't you know?
So get used to it
Get used to it!

The clash of religions
And the loaded prayers
Information
The face of starvation and the state of the nation

The sense that it's useless
And the fear to try
Not believing the leaders, the media that feed us
Living with the big lie

You get used to it
Get used to it!
It's okay, I got used to it",Living With the Big Lie (Album Version),2003

I drove towards it in my car
And I turned left and I turned right

And what gets in between
It's just somethin'

Between you and me
Between you and me

It sang around me. I went blind.

Fix it in the usual way
Meet me at the church and we'll get in a state
Stay up late and I'll wake up feeling like
A kid swingin' on heavens gate
With no God to complain
Or point the finger of blame
We'll get it all down on video 8
You comin' out to play?
Could be quite a day...

And I sang that pretty tune
An open airy song
And my heart looped the loop
Well I could do no wrong.

As I shine on the outside more these days
I can feel the outside feeding on my inside
Leaves a growing darkness in it's place
I think I have become one of the hollow men

I think I have become one of the lonely
Now that everybody talks to me
I feel I have become one of the empty

Hollow men can stop you with the twinkling of an eye
Hollow men can take you without even reaching out
Hollow men have got you long before you realize

The poison paralyzes

I think I have become one of a pair of men
It's a feeling I've been having for some time
I look down upon myself and watch my movements
A blind eye sees the fragile vandalized

Watch this cold world dishing up these endless hollow men
Find us anywhere you look
Come and meet our friends
Stand us in our silly clothes
Put our batteries in
Line us up like fairground ducks
Watch us grin and grin
See the lies behind our eyes
See the will to win
We'll buy you and we'll sell you
But perhaps we'll save your skin

Sit quietly and listen to the breeze
The hollow and the lonely listen too
Sniff the air for something we can use

Marillion,"She bought a bottle of cider
From the shop on the corner
They didn't stop her
Thought she was older

She took a bus ride
To a name and a number
A house full of music
And a hatful of wonder

And some of the people
That she thought that she knew
Were never like this
When she saw them at school
She's never been anywhere like this before
Everybody's so out of control

She was in a back room
Full of strange aromas
And noises and candles
That was where he found her

He took her to a garden
Full of rain and silence
And she could smell
The soil and the trees

And see the succulent light
From the little fires in his eyes
Pulling shapes out of the night
She was enchanted

Then it's twelve o'clock
And the last bus is gone
They're gonna go crazy
When they hear what she's done

And higher is lower
And less is like more
She's never felt anything
Like this before

And then it was yesterday
He said, ""Oh, by the way
Welcome to your first party""",The Party [Album Version] [Version],2003
Marillion,"There's a line on her jeans that a ball-point made
From a careless mistake that she can't wash away
And there's a heart on her sleeve from a spill of red wine
There's a piece of green in the blue of her eyes
She named it after me

There's a stray dog she feeds that she found in the street
And he loves her to hold him, but he won't let her keep him
And he claws at the door to be let out at night

And she makes do without him
And she worries about him
She named him after me

So if you ever decide that you have to escape
And travel the world and you can't find a place
Well, you could wind up believing
That paradise is nothing more than a feeling
That goes on in your mind

There's something you could do
'Cause if I ever hold that golden dream again
I want to tell you I'm gonna name it after you",After Me [Live],2003

And some of the people 
That she thought that she knew 
Were never like this

Full of strange aromas 
And noises and candles

He took her to a garden 
Full of rain and silence 
And she could smell the soil and the trees 
And see the succulent light from the little fires in his eyes 
Pulling shapes out of the night

Laughing at the world till the barman wipes away
The warm wet circles, the warm wet circles

I saw teenage girls like gaudy moths
A classrooms shabby butterflies
Flirt in the glow of stranded telephone boxes
Planning white lace weddings from smeared hearts
And token proclamations
Rolled from stolen lipsticks
Across the razored webs of glass

Sharing cigarettes with experience
With her giggling jealous confidantes
She faithfully traces his name
With quick bitten fingernails
Through the tears of condensation
That'll cry through the night
As the glancing headlights of the last bus
Kiss adolescence goodbye

In a warm wet circle
Like a mothers kiss on your first broken heart
A warm wet circle
Like a bullet hole in central park
A warm wet circle
And I'll always surrender
To the warm wet circles

She nervously undressed
In the dancing beams of the Fidra lighthouse
Giving it all away before it's too late
She'll let a lovers tongue move in, in a warm wet circle
Giving it all away, showing no shame
She'll take a mother's kiss
On her first broken heart, a warm wet circle
She'll realize that she played her part in a warm wet circle","Warm Wet Circles [7"" Version]",2009
Marillion,"When I hit the streets back in '81
Found a heart in the gutter and a poet's crown
I felt barbed wire kisses and icicle tears
Where have I been for all these years?

I saw political intrigue, political lies
Gonna wipe those smiles of self-satisfaction from their eyes

I will wear your white feather, I will carry your white flag
I will swear I have no nation but I'm proud to own my heart
I will wear your white feather, I will carry your white flag
I will swear I have no nation but I'm proud to own my heart
My heart, this is my heart

We don't need no uniforms, we have no disguise
Divided we stand, together we'll rise

We will wear your white feather all the children
We will carry your white flag
We will swear we have no nations Beirut children
But we're proud to own our hearts Jerusalem children

We will wear your white feather Tokyo children
We will carry your white flag Moscow children
We will swear we have no nations Washington children
But we're proud to own our hearts Munich children

These are our hearts Chicago children
These are our hearts Cairo children

You can't steal our hearts away

Where do we go from here, where do we go from here
Where do we go from here, where do we go from here
They boarded up the synagogues, Uzis on a street corner
You can't take a photograph of Uzis on a street corner
The DJ resigned today they wouldn't let him have his say
Surface scratched where the needles play, Uzis on a street corner

Where do we go from here

Terror in Rue de St. Denis, murder on the periphery
Someone else in someone else's pocket
Christ knows I don't know how to stop it
Poppies at the cenotaph, the cynics can't afford to laugh
I heard in on the telegraph there's Uzis on a street corner

Where do we go from here, where do we go from here

The more I see, the more I hear, the more I find fewer answers
I close my mind, I shout it out but you know it's getting harder
To calm down, to reason out, to come to terms with what it's all about
I'm uptight, can't sleep at night, I can't pretend everything's all right
My ideals, my sanity, they seem to be deserting me
But to stand up and fight I know we have six million reasons

They're burning down the synagogues, Uzis on a street corner
The heralds of the holocaust, Uzis on a street corner
The silence never louder than now, how quickly we forgot our vows
This resurrection we can't allow, Uzis on a street corner

Where do we go from here, where do we go from here

We buy fresh bagels from the corner store
Where swastikas are spat from aerosols
I sit in the bar sipping iced White Russian
Trying to score but nobody's pushing
And everyone looks at everyone's faces
Searching for signs and praying for traces of a conscience in residence
Are we sitting on a barbed wire fence
Racing the clouds home, racing the clouds home

We place our faith in human rights
In the paper wars that tie the red tape tight
I know that I would rather be out of this conspiracy
In the gulags and internment camps frozen faces in nameless ranks
I know that they would rather be standing here besides me
Racing the clouds home, racing the clouds home

You can shut your eyes, you can hide it away it's gonna come back another day
Racing the clouds home, are we racing the clouds home

Hollow men can take you without even reaching out
Hollow men have got you long before you realise

The poison paralyses

I think I have become one of a pair of men

I look down upon myself and watch my movements
A blind eye sees the fragile vandalised

Watch this cold world dishing up these endless hollow men
Find us anywhere you look
Come and meet our friends
Stand us in our silly clothes
Put our batteries in
Line us up like fairground ducks
Watch us grin and grin

See the will to win

That made all my past seem in the shadow
I always used to believe
That beauty was skin deep

Was the time that it took for me to fall
Hopelessly weak

No one can take you away from me now
Don't worry if they take me away
No one can take you away from me now
Don't matter how long we have to wait

Falling towards something out of control
Unable to miss like the man in a tram
Crashing your car in Amsterdam

In broad daylight, in broad daylight

And you don't even know

Took more than I could imagine, even now
You never knew how hard

The wave of a sleeve
Is the meaningless slew
Falls away from your feet

It's light, streaming free

From heavens fell

When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way

I did it my way""

If not himself, then he has naught

Marilyn Crispell,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Marilyn Crispell,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1987

Marilyn Harris,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies

Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything

It's the food pyramid,
And its approved the USDA

Oh grains of the foundation,
So please take my advice,
Of five to eleven servings of bread, cereal or rice,
Three to five of vegetables,
And four fruits is best,
Their antioxidensty fiber help you to digest,
Three servings of yogurt, milk and cheese,
Will help your bones and subsidize the cattle industry

A body needs to grow,
And grow and take regimes,
Why meat can be a tasty treat,
Like fish or even beans

And when you eat your sweets,
Make sure you try,
To limit your servings,
Or you'll

Die!

Marilyn Manson,"Paranoid, sitting in a deep sweat
Thinking I gotta fuck somebody before the week ends
The sight of blood excites me, shoot you in the head 
Sit down, and watch you bleed to death
I hear the sound of your last breath
Shouldn't have been around, I went all the way left
You was in the right place with me at the wrong time
I'm a psychopath, in a minute lose my fucking mind
Calm down, back to reality
Don't fear death, cause I know that it's promised to me
Flashes, I get flashes of Jason
Gimme a knife, a million lives I've wasted
The shadow of death follows me, I don't give a fuck
(In a mind of a lunatic)
Pussy play Superman, your ass'll get boxed up
Put him in a straight jacket, the man's sick
This is what goes on in the mind of a lunatic

Lookin through her window, now my body is warm
She's naked, and I'm a peepin tom
Her body's beautiful, so I'm thinking rape
Shouldn't have had her curtains open, so that's her fate
Leaving out her house, grabbed the bitch by her mouth
Drug her back in, slammed her down on the couch
Whipped out my knife, said, ""If you scream, I cut you""
Opened her legs and commenced the fucking
She begged me not to kill her so I gave her a rose
Then slit her throat and watched her shake till her eyes closed
(In a mind of a lunatic)
Had sex with the corpse before I left her
And drew my name on the wall like helter skelter
Run for shelter never crossed my mind
I had a gauge, a grenade, and even a nine
Dial 911 for the bitch
But the cops ain't shit
When they're fucking with a mind of a lunatic

I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at candles
Dreaming of the people I've dismantled
I close my eyes and in the circle 
Appears the images of sons of bitches that I murdered
Flashbacks of bodies being fucked up
Once I attack, I'm like a pit on a rage that's going nuts
Boys used to die when I'm full fo that fry
I be ebbin when I'm high 
So I say 'fuck' and just let bullets fly
(In a mind of a lunatic)
Like I said before, Scarface is my identity
A homicidal maniac with sucidal tendencies
I'm on the violent tip, so yo get a grip
And bitch, better come equipped, ain't taking no shit 
Cause here comes a mind of a lunatic

My girl's getting skinny, she's strung out on coke
So I went to her mother's house and cut out her throat
Her grandma was standing there, she was screaming out
As she reached for the telly, I put the blade on granny's ass
Went to the back and grabbed a shovel
Now granny's on her way to meet the devil
Pulled out my 38 and aimed at the bitch
A cop says Freeze, mutherfucker ! Bitch, suck my dick
(Mind of a lunatic)
I said, ""Die muthafucker !"" as I blasted 
Something clicked in my head, visions of bodies in plastic
The scent of buckshots in human flesh
Pigs dying from bullet wounds to the chest
No sheriff's gonna take me on a road
Dark as fuck, and let his pistols explode
Fuck that, cause I ain'ts to die
So I reloaded my Uzi and fired up another fry
It got me crazy as fuck
A ragin psychotic full of that Angel's Dust
The cops had the place surrounded 
Hunted for a way to get out - and I found it
Innocent bystanders watch me set an example
I popped one, ""Let me go, goddammit
Scot free
Or all of these mutherfuckers coming with me""
(In A Mind of a lunatic)
All of a sudden the shit got silent
I remember waking up, in an asylum
Being treated like a troubled kid
My shirt was all bloody, and both of my wrists was slit
Think this is harsh? This ain't as harsh as it gets
No telling what's being thought up in the mind of a lunatic

Janurary 5th 1969
A damn fool was born with the mind of a lunatic
I shoulda been killed
But sister fucked around and let me live
Now I developed a criminal behaviour
Fuck with me, and I'll slay your ass 
Beyond recognition, shit
Your dental records couldn't prove your identity, bitch
I beg your pardon, on talking to borden
You'll never find a mutherfucker, so save your milk cartons
(In A Mind of a lunatic)
Cross the line, your ass is mine
I don't give a fuck if you're 9 or 99
Blind, crippled, and crazy, don't faze me
Your funky ass will be pushing up daisies
You wanna know what makes me click?
My psychiatrist said I got the mind of a lunatic

I ain't got it all, so don't fuck with me
Unless your ass wanna be made history
I'll blow your mutherfucking house up
And if your wife and kids are inside, they're fucked 
I don't give a damn who I slay
Don't let me get a hold of some E&J
Cause when the shit hit the fan
I'll stab your ass quicker than a Mexican
The nightmares I leave you with on the scene

Instead of killing time, we'll have each other till the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face because I think our time has come

Digging your smile apart with my spade-tongue
And the hole is where the heart is
We built this tomb together; I will fill it alone
(Beyond the pale everything's black, no turning back)

If I was your vampire, certain as the moon
Instead of killing time, we'll have each other till the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face because I think our time has come

Blood-stained sheets
In the shape of your heart
This is where it starts
Blood-stained sheets
In the shape of your heart
This is where it starts
This is where it will end
Here comes the moon again

Six-nineteen, and I know I'm ready
Drive me off the mountain; you'll burn, and I'll eat your ashes
Impossible wheels seducing our corpse

If I was your vampire, certain as the moon
Instead of killing time, we'll have each other till the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face because I think our time has come

Marilyn Manson,"And then I found how to be what you want
I was out looking for something new
Digging too deep 
And now it’s too late
We just keep on
Breaking the same old ground
Breaking the same old ground

So you think that I asked for this
Let me show you
What I think of your lips
And you think that I asked for this
Come on
Use your fist

And then I found how to be what you want
When I was out looking for something new
Digging too deep 
And now it’s too late
We just keep on
Breaking the same old ground
Breaking the same old ground
We just keep on
Breaking the same old ground

So you think that I asked for this
Well, let me show you
What I think of your lips
And you think that I asked for this
Come on
Use your fist

When I found how to be what you want
I was out looking for something new
Digging too deep 
Now it’s too late
We just keep on
Breaking the same old ground
We just keep on
Breaking the same old ground

And
I’m in love with oblivion
I am owned by death
And
I’m in love with oblivion",Breaking the Same Old Ground,2012
