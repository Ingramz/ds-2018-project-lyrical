Ozzy Osbourne,"The fire started long ago
The flames burned out, still embers glow
So charred and black
There's nothing left to burn, to burn

We had the same dream
Lived life to extreme
A loaded gun jammed by a rose

The thorns are knots around your head
Your ego cursed you till you bled
You cannot crucify the dead
To me you're dead, yeah

The future is unset in stone
Decisions past leave you alone
Betrayed us all with your own selfish greed, your greed, yeah

New soldiers now say
That your beggars collect
Re-crucified and paid by you

The thorns are knots around your head
Your ego cursed you till you bled
You cannot crucify the dead
To me you're dead, yeah

We were like brothers with the world in our hands
You always have too much to say
Someday you look back and you wonder why
You let it all slip away, yeah

Crucify the dead
Crucify the dead

The thorns are knots around your head
Your ego cursed you till you bled
You cannot crucify the dead
To me you're dead, yeah",Crucify the Dead,2010
Ozzy Osbourne,"The light in the window is a crack in the sky
A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
The man in the dark will bring another attack

Your mama told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers
Look in the mirror tell me do you think your life's in danger here, yeah

No more tears

Another day passes as the night closes in
The red light goes on to say it's time to begin
I see the man around the corner waiting, can you see me?
I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here

No more tears

So now that it's over can't we just say good-bye?
I'd like to move on and make the most of the night
Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way
Your lips are so cold, I don't know what else to say

I never wanted it to end this way, my love, my darling
Believe me when I say to you in love I think I'm falling here

No more tears",No More Tears [Edit] [Edit],2014
Ozzy Osbourne,"Go
Come on

Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify
Can you help me occupy my brain? Oh yeah

I wanna see a fuckin' war cry

Come on
Come on you fuckers

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind

Everybody clap your hands
Oi, shout it out! Come on
Oi, shout! Come on put some fuckin' balls in to it

Hey
You ain't fuckin' shouting! Come on

Will you fuckin' wake up! Come on

All right

Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late

I can't hear you
Thank you! Goodnight! You are the fuckin' best!
Thank you! Goodnight! Bless you all
Thank you! Goodnight! You are the fuckin' best",Paranoid [Live][#],2014
P,"I signed my name with a smile
X marked the spot on the edge of denial

I got a deal one for two
And you said you’ll never have to settle on you.

I met the king of the rain
“Love for the pain?” I heard them say.
Here take my hands, wash them clean.
Cause I’m not the man I thought I dreamed.

Sometimes I’m dumb but I’ll never be numb
I can feel you.
You fill me like fire in my veins,
And I’m free cause you’re holding me down.

I might be lame but you move me the same
I can see you.
It’s a scene like stars in the day.
And I’m free cause you’re holding me down.

I threw my conscious away.
I’ve got my reasons, my problems today.
I turn and my heart skips a beat.
I see you running, smiling, welcoming me.

I might be dumb but I’ll never be numb
I can feel you.
You fill me like fire in my veins,
And I’m free cause you’re holding me down.

I might be lame but inside I’m the same.
I can see you.
It’s a scene like stars in the day.
And I’m free cause you’re holding me down.

Man, I’ve crashed out.
You know I’ve crawled for a mile.
And I’ve got pain, take it away.

I might be dumb but I’ll never be numb
I can feel you.

I might be dumb but I’ll never be numb
I can feel you.
You fill me like fire in my veins,
And I’m free cause you’re holding me down.

I might be lame but inside I’m the same.
I can see you.
It’s a scene like stars in the day.
And I’m free cause you’re holding me down.",The Deal,1995

What's understood ain't gotta be said SIMPLE

Don't Let em Down

I see you Zipo, I got ya homie

[Verse 1]
No mo Jose no mo Rosie
They locked my dog up and that ain't ro-zay
All he wanted was the fame make it last forever
You get some ones I get some ones we make it rain together
I'm talkin' Quabo dreams crystal fetishes
Smokin' everyday just to keep ya sanity
Just me and nigga like what up doe
Still partyin' the club closed an hour ago
I guess the back to back Lambo's a thing of the past
We used to talk on a chirp now we talking through a glass
Just like the glass I know he sees right through me
Transparent I can't hide my window pain
I'm thinkin' what to say to make him have a better day
I'm walkin' down this lil hallway like what the fuck I'm gonna say
As I'm walkin' down the halls I feel the stress in the walls
I need to lighten up man this shit is too tense
Feels like I need? my heart aches so bad
When he sees my face he's gonna be so glad
Then I look into his eyes swear to god I seen his soul
Tell me what can make a hot boy stare so cold
As I looked a lil deeper I saw a lil hope then he cracked a smile
He still got his pride
Keep doin' what you doin' hold us real niggas down
No matter what you do don't let us real niggas down

[Chorus]
Jeezy don't do it
Don't you let em down Young Jeezy
Don't you let em down Young Jeezy
No no no no no
No
Jeezy don't do it

[Verse 2]
I done been through so much real life done lose touch
And yet so much yell of my sense of smell and I don't mean that literally
But I mean this literally these niggas actors me I'm a factory
Known for movin' big money sh*t at least a tractor
No breaks no tires I'm a ride for these streets yeah till the wheels
Fall off
It's gonna take more then hate to get my focus off can't knock the
Hustle still stackin' dead presidents They say he on his way out well that's a
Reasonable doubt ain't no niggas like the ones I got friend or foe politics as usual
I'm feelin' it still livin' with regrets with all these imaginary players you must love me
I told y'all in do time the city is mine

[Chorus: x2]

No, no",Don't Do It,
P Cutta,"See you need to focus man
But my girl ain't got snobby, stuntin' like her Daddy
Vroom on her Yamaha, she ride me like a Kawasaki
I call her little buddy, sometimes I call her shorty
She only wears dresses, she sleep in Ed Harty (ya dig?)
It's young Weezy, the 80s baby
And we can get together make 80 babies
Now the house, brand new, the car brand new
But you're still the same old you
And that's why I love you

Girl, from the moment that I saw you, I knew you were the one
Though, we didn't have a lot of money, we still had so much fun (so much fun)
No, matter where you are you'll always be my superstar
If it wasn't for your love, I don't think I'd have gone this far

(Proud of you)
Baby, you never got brand new
Yo, baby, 'cause you never got brand new

I, remember livin' in the projects
I, remember spendin' welfare checks
That, something you never never forget
How could I abandon you now?
You'll always be a superstar
(You will always be)
No matter where you are
(My heart has never felt this before)

(Proud of you)
Baby, you never got brand new
Yo, baby, you never got brand new

Baby, we came from nothing
And we turned it into something
And we never ever act like,
We're too good, we too bougey for the hood life
Real recognize real, and you know this
Living with me in the streets and the show biz
(Now everybody know your name, and they caught up in the fame)
(You still the same, nobody can keep up with you, yeah)

'Cause you never got brand new (all the money)

P Cutta,"Back the hell off
Rock 'n' roll Jesus with all my nails on
All I need is a blunt and a bail bond
And give these blind motherfuckers something to feel on
Rollin' like a motherfucker put your wheels on
And lets roll down and heal till the heal gone
I started on the block but that something to build on
And how can I pray when I got nothing to kneel on

Hey
The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which cloud I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the ground is gone

Walk on air, 
show me to the edge and I walk off there
We ain't high enuff O'contraire, 
and sometimes life just don't compare
Say my name baby pull my hair, 
and I'm a fuck you like a bull I swear
I gotta lot of love that I could just share
I gotta lot of drugs that I could just share!
I know I know where should I go, 
a nice lil' mirror and a little white girl
Way at the top of the mountain, bouncing.
May I be everything but grounded!
I don't ever wanna see the bottom the bottom
I just wanna float, float like Muhammad.
I don't ever wanna see the bottom the bottom

I know a girl named Crystal her last name Ball
I look into her eyes and I can see it all
I see it when she cry, I'm there when she call
Cause I live inside of the mirror on the wall

Kill 'em all, die in the spirit of the war
Thinkin' would a mind be in spiritual for

P Cutta,"I want to be the best
I want to be the best that ever played
That's why I play the game
And to be the best you have to win
That's what drives me

He's the best player in the game
It's just that simple
There's nothing that Kobe Bryant can't do
He will defend your best player
He will shoot from the perimeter
He will get all in yo mug
He will do whatever it takes
He is the most complete basketball player
In the game today - bar none
He has an assassins mentality
I said this week, I said this when the trade went down
And I will repeat it again
Who's starving more for an NBA World Championship
More than Kobe Bryant? There is no one
This guy is highly motivated
What separates Kobe from the pack?
More than Kobe Bryant, there is no one

Okay
Kobe doin' work
Two four on my shirt
He the greatest on the court
And I'm the greatest on the verse
Going for the 4th ring like it was his first
Gotta get the bling
Do it for Kareem!
24 (two-four) so nice, my flow so mean
Catch me at the game sitting next to Goldestein
Kobe Bryant Nikes, purple gold strings,
Kobe in the game dunking on your team
Black Mamba, attack conquer
Basketball beast, rap monster
Crossover good, a turnaround jumper
Or just drive in the lane and dunk on dunkers
You know where it's going, it's going down yo
This is the Lakeshow, but don't drown though
I call him King Bryant, now let the crown show

I'm definitely, I'm just lost for words
I mean, he's amazing

Pass me the damn ball
I don't need a pick at all
And don't worry bout my shot
'Cause I'ma get that off
Yea, I drops 40 on your double team
Then I drop 81 on another team
Yeah, you better guard me with caution
And watch I work em like an auction
No such thing as exhaustion
No time for resting
'Cause I don't take breaks
I just break records
And I prefer the ball with three seconds
And I bet we gone win it all in three seconds
Ya dig? That is a guarantee
Apparently
And please tell your defense
Don't ever man to man with me
Double team, triple team
Your defenders sick of me
But, I never let em get to me
Literally
Step back and give em a three
Ain't no defending me

One guy certainly envious of the way Bryant's playing lately
LeBron James

I've been recorded saying that
He's definitely the best player in our League
Um, to me, in my eyes
The best scorer in our League
And there's not another guy in our League
That can accomplish some of the things
That he's doing

Never take a day off
Catch you at the top of the key
And get a J off
Baseline face time
Tongue out like two-three
Two-three gotta love how I do me
Practice while you sleep
Practice in my sleep
Straight outta high school
Tha' brackets ain't for me
I will be jumping over you
Like I got a mattress at my feet
And all the Phil Jackson teams
Better be passing it to me
I put the master in the beast
Attack you like a beast
I am starving for victory
And that means ima eat
And when they ask you who's the best
Then the answer should be me

Who's the best player in the NBA?
Um, I'll say Kobe Bryant.
Really? Why?
Because you never know what you're gonna get

Call me Mr. Clutch or Mr. automatic
I can post em up, or Lamar go get the ally
I'm going for the ring
I'm going for the ring
I went to Beijing
And came back with the bling
Who they want?
They want Kobe
And what he want?
He want the trophy
The victory
And the glory
No Shaq
No Robert Horry
Now break em off, Kobe break em off
You better be where that Laker don't
Yea, just give him the ball and he take it off
Or he properly dishing it to Gasol
Or give it to D-Fish on the wing, yeah
Or just let lil' Ariza do his thing, yeah
'Cause I'm great, and so is my team, yeah

(I thought you want to be the greatest)

Do it for Magic
It's your time baby
I see nothing wrong with doing it four times baby
I'm the best yes
And he the best yeah
Don't worry LeBron, get 'em next year
Now what's defense
To an assassin
Killer instinct
Murder the basket
Then steal the ball back
Hold it for ransom
It's more than a game
This is a passion
Been a All-Star, been a Champion
Free throw line, you hear em chanting
M.V.P. M.V.P.
Kobe Bryant aka Envy Me
In knee deep, smash any D
Whoever he is he can't guard me
He can't guard me

So, there you have it. The overwhelming answer was Kobe Bryant",Kobe Bryant,2009
P Cutta,"Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
Think I had the motherfucking plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I’m the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn, that punch line was predictable
I still got you shitting bricks, homie quit the bull
And we don’t need new members, to me the clique is full
And I be getting the same women that Tip can pull
Believe or not, I receive a lot
So I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buying the Louis that Kanyeezy cop
And I be ripping the same records that Weezy rock
This shit is easy pop
That’s why I’m ready man
I’d never copy Nor-bit like Eddie man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head, did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just trying to make a four fit
Yeah, they need to issue out a recall
I’m going up and they heading into a freefall
The fundamentals are needed, you playing streetball
And I was out at BET, but I didn’t see ya’ll
These Skee-Lo rappers wishing they could be tall
Letting all their fake friends use them like a free stall

No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya dig

I said I know you see me chilling super low key
If I’m with the right niggas, you can scoop an O.Z
All the hustlers and the bouncers and the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shades in a coupe with no keys
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cutting, we can cut some more
Then after you get high
Make em, get em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got a lota dough plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain’t heard? I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend even if they been offended
They ain’t really got a choice, it’s an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it’s a given
Plus a nigga famous, plus I got a vision
Not to mention having bars like a motherfucking prison
They taking too long, their records on hold
They threatened by my presence cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they bragging bout what they sold
Just remember where I lived at, fifty thousand's going gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
Instead of hatin’ on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man, you acting like a bitch
I ain’t acting like I’m rude
I’m just acting like I’m rich, rich
Riding with Weezy fucking Baby
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fucking, baby?

Black Ferrari with the red seats
I call it playin checkers
I'm never doing verses
I'm forever giving lectures
If you're tryna meet with money
I'd be happy to connect ya
Life is, better than its ever been
Scheduling million dollar meetings with the president
Someone cut the lights on
Where is Thomas Edison
Got a new condo watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you tryna zone I got a whole swisha sweet full
Rappers are liars and they women are deceitful
Adding till they subtract me I never be a equal
Last place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me just write every single thing you need down
Then he got it for me and I'm happy as can be now
Bout to start ballin' like I'm coming off ofa rebound
Yea
And I should have the most bragging rights
Because a nigga spit crack, bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they tryna get they swagger right
Cause I done came wit mo' fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you pussy ass hater you should do you
You ain't heard of me then you should go and get a Blue's Clue
Oops I mean a red clue
Wayne's here, su WOO
Bet he felt that like the end of a pool cue
But I ain't banging I ain't waving no flag
I'm ATF but they ain't seein no badge
Its heartbreak Drake I hate to see 'em so sad
I could son you, see a little me in yo' dad

Can pocket twenty thousand to be anywhere they ask me
Cash like Johnny, Banks like Ashley
Burning like a Camel Light
Stupid hoe ash me
But don't ask me shit about me
And kno the game really ain't shit without me

Suck nut you duck fuck your unlovin kin

Kick my princess up out my castle dad who
Never had that dude
Always had a black tool
Even when I was at school 'cause bullies aren't bulletproof
Red scarf hoodie too

Stupid motherfucker the only thing in the hood is you

And I just sold a lot of property to a buyer
And I think his name was kinda like drake drizzy rogers or
Drizzy drake rogers I'm too busy to play father
And when it comes to the game I'm to willing to play harder
So harder I go there he go
They chant mvp when I shoot a free-throw, CEO
Jazz what it do
The haters on their face and then their ass is a shoe
Faster than you
Badder than you
Radder than you, etcetera
I told you I get paid by the letter like
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY
ZZ top, yes he rock
And me and drizzy both wrote on detox
That was just a foot note
How long can he could go
Wonderin when he stop'
Bitch when the beat stop
So ima keep rockin
Till the sheet rock bend
In the heat I singe
Burnt skin

I see the NARCs stash my coat then hit the park
Don't wanna get knocked, for sixty rocks in a sock
You know the ghetto's red hot, gots to shot that on my block

I keep it strictly business, it's unfinished if there's a witness
I take it personal when bitch-ass niggaz start to snitchin'

And like Biggie, I'm ""Ready to Die"" for what you got
Got a crew with killas behind me, I'm grimey
I'm one of the big body, blowin' cushions where you can find me
For figures, we bust triggers, who could fuck with us?
Dub, E-40, Christ Bearer, plus RZA
Stick you with the Blade, we gots to get paid
And for the moolah, we intertwine like French braids
And I can't fight the feeling like one way
When it comes down to this gangsta shit and gun play
For the loot, we compute it, quick to shoot it
So hit the switch, punk blew it, and bang the music

Get two thirty off the head with cold dumplings
Niggaz jump when the AK bark
Crystal grip pump, make the gun niggaz spark
You dig? Niggaz ready for war
Been carryin' the world for so long, it ain't heavy no more
And even when the sirens roar, I taught the violence gore to start firing more
And when we run out of bullets, and you still want static?
I grab the three eighty and pull out the automatic
We better get the money, for shootin' Mossbergs and Beretta's
Niggaz ain't shit funny, when it comes to a brawl
Suckin' Northstar, trippin' in
Guns go off, why'all know why'all strippin'

I grab a bullet, travel, bodies hit the floor
Can't be scared of your shadow, you gotta have heart
Killas on my soil, will turn off the lights and park
Get out the car, unlock, fill out the chopper and let it chop
Walk off like nothing happened, give a fuck bout a cop
Touch you with the Blade, take off your toupee
Put my dirt in your glocks, sometimes I do my dark in the day
My momma didn't raise no sick, she raised a beast
And I can't rest til my enemies rest in peace
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Run up on me, I'ma knock the hell outta why'all
My back against the ball, strappin' and jackin', I'm puttin' hands on 'em
One hitter, quitter, bob & weavin', karate stance on 'em
Dance on 'em, ran on 'em, and land on 'em
Put my brand on 'em, stand on 'em, because I can on 'em

But I'm not every girl and I don't need that world to validate me
Cuz shorty's got a job, shorty's got a car, shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

I was a girl about the floss
It was all about the cost, how much he spent on me
Seek, for a man who's got the means
To be givin' you diamond rings
It's what every fly girl could want or even dream
But I'm not every girl and I don't need no G to take care of me
Cuz shorty's got a job, shorty's got a car, shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart, no no

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

Most girls want a man with the bling bling

And I don't need no G to take care of me, no
'Cause shorty's got a job, shorty's got a car, shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart, oh most girls

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

Most girls want a man with the mean green

'Cause I'm not most girls, don't wanna dance if he can't be everything

P!nk,"I've been a girl with her skirt pulled high
Been the outcast never running with mascara eyes
I see the world
As a candy store

With a cigarette smile saying things you can't ignore
Like, mommy I love you
Daddy I hate you
Brother I need you

Love or hate, fuck you, I can see everything
Here with my third eye
Like the blue in the sky

If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
love is the rhythm,you are the music
If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
you get what you're given it's all how you use it

I've been a girl with her finger in the air Unaffected by rumors the truth I don't care
So open your mouth, stick out your tongue
Might as well let go, you can't take back what you've done
Just find a new life style,reason to smile

Look for nirvana, under the strobe lights
Sequins and sex strings
You whisper to me
There's no reason to cry

If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
love is the rhythm,you are the music
If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
you get what you're given it's all how you use it

Take what you get and get what you give
I said don't run from yourself,man, that's no way to live( no, no)
I've got a record in my bag,you should give it a spin
Put your hands in the air so that life can begin

(If God is a D.J, if God, say if God is a dj, if God...then life is a dance floor)
Get your ass on the dance floor now!

If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
love is the rhythm,you are the music
If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
you get what you're given it's all how you use it

If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
love is the rhythm,you are the music
If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor

Touch of her skin feeling silky smooth
Color of cafe au lait alright
Made the savage beast inside roar until he cried,

But when he turns off to sleep memories creep,

I see you try to hurt me bad

That'll lay there let you come first

I'll just get back up

You can run over me with your 18 wheeler but
You can't keep me down

You got your shield and sword

So many players you'd think I was a ball game.
It's every man for himself.

This life gets lonely
When everybody wants something.
They'll smile up in your face,
But they'll get theirs eventually,
And I hope I'm there.

Surrounded by familiar faces with no names.
None of them know me
Or want to share my pain.
They only wish to bask in my light
Then fade away.

To win my love,
To them a game,
To watch me live my life in vain.
When all is done
And the good fades away
They'll get theirs eventually,
And I hope I'm there.

I drank your poison, 
Cause you told me it's wine.

Shame on me if you fooled me once.
Shame on me if you fooled me twice.

Seems its my destiny 
For love to cause me misery 

And, oh! I've been down this road before 
With a passion that turns into pain 
And each I saw love walk out the door 
I swore never get caught again 

But ain't it true? It takes what it takes 
And sometime we get too smart to late.

Told me he would keep it all on the low-low
But I told him, ""boo, I don't really know though""
He got closer to me, it started getting deep
He had me in a zone when he started to show me things
I never saw before

The way he licked his lips and touched my hips
I knew that he was slick

Gotta pull all the windows down
Eyes lead and I'm thinking bout the sheets now
Wondering should I really take it there now
He told me he would make it worth it
Again, how many times have I heard this
Kinda funny, but I wasn't even nervous
Well his slick-ass lines were kinda working
I felt my knees get weak, his body was calling me
Just couldn't take the heat
Anyway it was 2 or 3, I had to get off the streets
Baby was cool but I knew it was game
Said, he was too schooled to be screaming my name

Yeah, yeah, it's Pink, feelin' naughty

No way that I can fight it, I got my eye on you
You got me so excited, so what you gonna do'

I dig deep like the ship sunk, saw Pink cutie wink once
Had on fitted jeans, thong showing, pink pumps
Puppy named Fucker, back to her body, boom bow
Escalation push had ribs like, oh, child

Taking you to lunch, what you gonna do'
She said, ""I'm picking up the check and
Handing it to you"", fine and witty, oh, so pretty
Drop the Gucci, prop that coochie, oops

I lost my train of thought watching her walk
You know, I'm looking at that ass, it ain't my fault
Get drinks, get laugh, get talk, get long
Got Pink, got hash, got smoke, got blunts

Rhinestones spiffy, she's more than pretty
Lovin' my thuggin', rubbin' my fifty nine fifty
Bullets in your bra or your nipples, hey

Check it, first met her at the Fox Hill mall, getting out of her car
She had a homie with her stood about six feet tall
Both swing couldn't help but think manajatwa
So where you from we represent Crenshaw

Where they bang by law, slip your jack in your car
Oh, and I'm Kelly and her name is Sherry
And she likes to sip yeagermister from her belly
We'll show you if you wanna we can go hit the deli
Man, I don't think you're ready for this jelly

All pre-trick, a major erection before we go pull over at a 7-11
Protection is a must to survive and in ghetto heaven
You gotta wrap it up before you go and put your head in
We pulled up and jumped right in bed
While caressing my head, they looked up and said

I like the way you rock, I hope you never stop
I like the way you sound, the way you put it down
No way that I can fight it, I got my eye on you
You got me so excited, so what you gonna do'

that's the way, kay, kay
Naughty likes it, kay, kay

What I wanna do you had to pick that question
Kiss it, lick it, extra friction, flex it
Love the kitty, tongue and tittie, till you sweat it
Toss you 'round my room like boom' I'll press it
I like, I like, back forth, heave ho

Round and round, baby, round we go
And I ain't here to taste the poom poom for hours
I'm here to make your poom poom hours
In the shower, in the sauna, in the deli
Boom Machiavelli, KY jelly, ass to belly

Don't hide it, divide it, I'm two steps behind it

You fight about money, 'bout me and my brother
And this I come home to, this is my shelter

Love or hate, fuck you, I can see everything
Here with my third eye

Unaffected by rumors the truth I don't care
So open your mouth, stick out your tongue
Might as well let go, you can't take back what you've done
Just find a new life style,reason to smile
Look for nirvana, under the strobe lights
Sequins and sex strings
You whisper to me
There's no reason to cry

There's so much I would give ya baby, if I'd only let myself
There's this wall of emotions I feel I must protect
What's the point of this armor, if it keeps the love away too
I'd rather bleed with cuts of love then live without any scars

Baby can I trust this or do all things end
I need to hear that you'd die for me again and again and again
So tell me when you look in my eyes can you share all the pain and the happy times
Cause I will love you for the rest of my life

You follow every line, you wear your perfect patch and style
But you're like a satellite and you're driftin' through the sky
You can't make up your mind about this or that, or anything at all
So you go with the flow and hope to God that no one knows it


Everything you are, everything you say
Everything you do is not for you
Everything you feel, everything you know
You found it on your favorite TV show

And it's people like you that make me sick
I'm surrounded by you everywhere I look

You're telling everyone how different that you really are
But it's been said before, so maybe you're not special after all
If you put the same amount of effort into letting go
Just act yourself and you might like it, you never know

Cause everything you want, everything you do
You try so hard to be everyone but you
Everywhere you turn, you just gotta learn
It's easier if you don't try so hard

And it's people like you that make me sick
I'm surrounded by you everywhere I look

And it's people like you that make me sick
I'm surrounded by you everywhere I look

And it's people like you that me me sick
I'm surrounded by you everywhere I look
Is there somewhere I can go to get away
Where there's truth and people mean just what they say

You try too hard
You just try too hard
You try too hard

And it's people like you that make me sick
I'm surrounded by you everywhere I look

Is there somewhere we can go to get away
Where there's truth and people mean just what they say

You try too hard
You just try too hard",Try Too Hard,2003

You always said I'd be your wife
What happened to the days when
Life was simple (So Simple)
Everyone knows my name
I haven't changed, I'm the same girl

Everything's rearranged, you came
And changed it and gave me a broken heart

You want to take the easy route

When it's so easy for you to walk away

So here I am, driving down the street
Lookin' for a sign, when will I meet
The man of my dreams?
When will he come to me?
When will he come to me?
I'm sick of trying, I'm goin' home back
To PA where I come from
And you can stay here and spend your
Whole life running, But baby I'm
Gonna move on
You don't want to work it out, no
You want to take the easy route

What will you do, now all your fears
Came true

You had it all- didn't you
Cause I'm sick of tryin' I'm goin' home
Back to Philly where I come from

Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday

No one wants to hear the truth,
Coming from three political queers.

So you break up the band
And leave us all in tow.

Did it give you vaccination?
I saw it on my T.V.
Did it lighten up your load?
And every fuckin D.J.
Did you feel affilliated,

Like you really had a home?

Free to be a loser
Were the ticket prices too high?
Free to be a trend
Were the lights too bright?
Free to be a backlash over and over again.
Was it all a bunch of hype?

You say, ""I'm losing inspiration,
One band at a time.
I gotta know there's someone, somewhere, out there singing for our side.""

Where I come up, we share the mortar and the glue.
And what we build together, we share that too.
And the wind may come, and the rain may fall,
But we stand together or we don't stand at all.
Where are you going to now,
Now that the goings gone?

And swimming up the stream,
Crossing over one dam after another

Come take a walk with me
Let's pretend we're just two people and
You're not better than me
I'd like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly

What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street?
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?
What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
Are you proud?

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye
And tell me why?

Dear Mr. President
Were you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
How can you say
No child is left behind?
We're not dumb, and we're not blind
They're all sitting in your cells
While you pave the road to hell

What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say
You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye?

Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Minimum wage with a baby on the way
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Building a bed out of a cardboard box
Let me tell you 'bout hard work

You don't know nothing 'bout hard work

I've always been a sucker
Had a weakness for a boy with a guitar and a drink in his hand
His words were like heaven in my hurricane
My knees buckled under
I thought everyone was watching me
Watching you save my life with the song

You were mine
In the back of my mind
Oh, just for one night
Just for a while

There's always one that gets away
The one that sneaks up on you then slips away

Two weeks later I was sitting in his apartment
He was making cappuccino
I said, 'what kind of man makes cappuccino?'
We laughed
We laughed
We laughed
We laughed till tears ran down my face

Oh, but, my man, you're someone else's man
And that ain't the man that I want
But you keep drawing me in with those big, brown, lying eyes

You'll always be mine
In the back of my mind
Oh, we had a night
Just a little while

There's always one that gets away
The one that sneaks up on you then slips away

In a closed off corner of my heart, yes

I'm not a victim of cliches
I don't believe in soul mates
Happy endings, only one
Oh, and I met you, and all that changed
I had a taste, and you're still sitting on the tip of my tongue

You were mine
Somewhere in time
I'll look for you first
In my next life

There's always one that gets away
The one that sneaks up on you then slips away

Or guidance

And you always walk alone

Is it a light from the angels, or your devil deep inside?

There's a ring around my finger,
But will you change your mind?
And you tell me that I'm beautiful,
But that could be a lie

Are you a heartbreaker?
Maybe you want me for the ride
What if I'm fallin' for a heartbreaker?
And everything is just a lie

I won't be leavin' here alive, no

'Cause I'm always watchin' for someone to show their darker side
So maybe I'll sit back and just enjoy all this for now
Watch it all play out, see if you really stick around

But there's always this one question
That keeps me up at night
Are you my greatest love
Or disappointment in my life?

Are you a heartbreaker?
Maybe you want me for the ride
What if I'm fallin' for a heartbreaker?

You talk real loud
But you ain't saying nothing cool

I press record, I become a phene
And no one else is watching
I let my fingers do the walking

I'm starvin' for some attention
I'm beggin', pleadin', bleedin' for a suggestion

P!nk,"Dear Mr. President,
Come take a walk with me
Let's pretend we're just two people 
And you're not better than me
I'd like to ask you some questions
If we can speak honestly

What do you feel when you see 
All the homeless on the street?
Who do you pray for at night
Before you go to sleep?
What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
Are you proud?

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye?
And tell me why?

Dear Mr. President,
Were you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
How can you say, no child is left behind?
We're not dumb and we're not blind
They're all sitting in your Selves
When you pave the road to hell

What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?
What kind of father might hate his own daugther if she were gay?
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say
You've come a long way, from whiskey and cocaine

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye?

Let me tell you about hard work
Minimum wage with a baby on the way
Let me tell you about hard work
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
Let me tell you about hard work
Building a bed out of a cardboard box
Let me tell you about hard work
Hard work, hard work, you don't know nothing about hard work
Hard work, hard work

How do you sleep at night?
How do you walk with your head held high?

You'll never take a walk with me...",Dear Mr. President [DVD],2007

Breath before the phrase
Have you ever felt this way?

Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone?
You're whole life waiting on the ring to prove you're not alone
Have you ever been touched so gently you had to cry?
Have you ever invited a stranger to come inside?

It's only half past the point of oblivion
The hourglass on the table
The walk before the run
The breath before the kiss
And the fear before the flames
Have you ever felt this way?

La la la la la la la la

There you are, sitting in the garden
Clutching my coffee,
Calling me sugar
You called me sugar

Have you ever wished for an endless night?
Lassoed the moon and the stars and pulled that rope tight
Have you ever held your breath and asked yourself
Will it ever get better than tonight?

When it comes and everything's undone?
Is it 'cause we wanna be free?
Well that's not me,
Normally I'm so strong,
I just can't wake up on the floor
Like a thousand times before,
Knowing that forever won't be.

Always sentimental when, I think of how it was,
When love was sweet and new and we just, couldn't get enough,
The shower it reminds me you'd undress me with your eyes,
And now you never touch me and you tell me that you're tired.

You know I get so sad when it all goes bad,
And all you think about is all the fun you had,
And all those sorries ain't never gonna mean a thing, oh

It's like a train wreck tryin' to hit the right track,
We opened up the wine and we just let it breathe,
But we should of drank it down while it was still sweet,
It all goes bad eventually.

Now do we stay together cause, we're scared to be alone?
We got so used to this abuse, it kind of feels like home

Better call the cops on 'em quick fast

Does a bird chirp, Lil' Wayne slurps syrup 'til he burps

Of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic
Or your the kind of girl that I can take a liking to
Sike I'm spiking you like a football
Been this way since I've stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse
Gotta pretty mouth and a good jaw
Gimme good brain
Watch the wood grain, don't want no cum stain
Bitch you listening tryna' turn me down
Slut I'm talking to you, turn me back up
Are you insane tryna talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shits playin'
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
Whats the saying? Where there's thunder there's light-ening
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations
On four separate occasions?
And you can bet your stanking ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road took the psychopath
Poison ivy wouldn't have me thinking rash
So hit the dance floor cutie while I do my duty on this microphone
Shake your booty shawty I'm the shit

Hope is lost
And giving up
Is all you got,

Your confidence is cracked,

Why the holiest hearts can feel the strongest palpitations

That's when you can build a bridge of light,

That's when you can't give up the fight

That's when love turns nighttime into day,
That's when loneliness goes away,
That's why you gotta be strong tonight,
Only love can build us a bridge of light

When your feet are made of stone
You're convinced that you're all alone
Look at the stars instead of the dark
You'll find your heart shines like the sun

Let's not let our anger get us lost
And the need to be right comes at way too high a cost

You wake up fucked up and you grab a pen
And you say to yourself
I'm gonna figure it out, I'm gonna crack that code
Gonna break it break it down
I'm tired of all these questions
And, now it's just annoying
'Cause, no one has the answer
So I guess it's up to me to find the truth about love is it comes and it goes

A strange fascination with his lips on toes
Morning breath, bedroom eyes on a smiling face
Sheet marks, rug burn, and a sugar glaze
Shocking me all, they can eat your eyes
It's the truth about love

I think it just may be perfect
The only person of my dreams
I never ever ever ever been this happy
But now something has changed
And the truth about love is it's all a lie
I thought you were the one, and I hate goodbyes

Oh, you want the truth?

The truth about love is it's nasty and salty
It's the regret in the morning, it's the smelling of armpits
It's wings, and songs
And trees, and birds
It's all the poetry that you ever heard
(Terra) crudités, lifeline forget-me-nots
It's the hunt and the kill
The schemes and the plots
The truth about love is it's blood and it's guts
Purebreds and mutts
Sandwiches without the crust
It takes your breathe, cuts and leaves a scar
But those untouched never got never got very far
It's rage and it's hate
And a sick twist of fate
And that's the truth about love
The truth about love

I think it just may be perfect
The only person of my dreams
I never ever ever ever been this happy
But now something has changed
And the truth about love is it's all a lie
I thought you were the one, and I hate goodbyes

Oh you can lose your breath
Oh, you can shoot a gun and
Convinced you're the only one that's ever felt this way before
It hurts inside the hell we've been in
It falls to get a pocket-thin and
It's raised before the angels' lips and
It can turn you into a son of a bitch man

In our haste, our need, our thirst we lost our sight

When I trip from your lips my heart was like a kick-drum
And it silenced the guilt, I wasn't raised to hurt anyone

Never had to play with matches to start a fire
But it got so cold and I thought I'd forgotten desire

Do anything for 'em cause you truly do adore 'em

But they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore 'em
But you feel like they feel like you ain’t right for 'em
Therefore your heart’s torn
Between bein' with 'em forever, leavin' 'em never
But it seem like you arguin', fightin' over whatever
Maybe we can leave, find someone better
Even though you will, you never know nothin' better

Been head over heels since the very day I met her
Fell so deep in love I ain’t been able to get up
Sometimes I want some peace of mind and she don’t shut up
Love her to death, don’t know whether to kiss her or kill her

I buy a lot of Prada, Gucci and Balenciaga
To keep her content, and keep down the nonsense
With every corner we turn, around the conflict
Mostly dumb shit, like who she run with
Where the fuck you been? Your pants, they don’t fit
Really, honestly speaking, some things I don’t get
No matter how much she try she can’t make it make more sense
Therefore, here we go again
Screamin', yellin' at the top of our lungs, she goin' in
Seeing the kind of shit I be like ""if you was a man
I would go in your shit, for real, no shit""
But I love her so much that I can’t forget
That the feel of a kiss, it could heal when I’m sick
Still, I don’t like to feel like this
If I wouldn’t miss her, I would try to get her killed right quick

We need equality and for all to see that this is the new way (not gay)
It just seems (not gay) wrong (not gay)

This (not gay) madness has to end (not gay)

You were born your way (gay)

It's time to make a change (yes)
It's time to stop the hate (uh)

We can't live this way (n'gay)
We can't turn away (n'gay)

The time for change is now (sports)

Lying in bed next to ten beautiful girls (all straight)
And while I made love to every one of them
I was thinking about the world (hot wings)

How is it that I can have so much straight sex while two dudes are oppressed (not gay)
For having sex (not gay)
Or putting on a wedding dress (I assume)
I don't really know that much about it (beef jerky tastes good)
Politics are important
And if girls wanna have sex with me 'cause I said this, so be it (n'gay)
I'm not a hero, I'm just speaking the truth
I'm not a hero, don't call me a hero
(Beer, hoagie, sweatpants, not gay)
Yeah, not a hero (titties, not gay)

I'm not a hero
(I'm just a person)
So don't call me a hero
(Not some kind of world leader)
I just want equal rights (yeah)
And to sleep at night (yeah)
Next to a girl

True love trumps all (predator)
(Flying kicks, not gay, big watch)
(Not gay, missionary) one love
(Gym socks, nunchuck and not gay)
(Lighter fluid, HD, Ninja) world peace
(Four-wheel drive) gay marriage (love beef)
Free love (golf clubs)
Two guys (not gay)

I'm not gay

I was born this way (I'm straight)
You were born your way (you're gay)
Gay or straight, straight or gay, it's all okay

Said ""Do you think we’ll live forever?""

So shop with me or I'll lay ya down, I want it all 'cause I'm a hound

Finally came up, rich drugs, big plugs
Spit hollow tip slugs and the trigger fit snug

Buy from me or kick ducks 'cause the dope gonna sell it self
And I, good enough to play hard and invest the rest

Now, everybody wanna be the king of the south 
When, they ain't runnin' a damn thing but they mouth 
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just statin y'all opinion 
But in the south, in any hood, its understood without sayin' 
It's a given, and it ain't cuz of what I'm doin' for a livin' 
It's, more because of what I do and how I'm livin' 
Not to mention, when I'm rappin', I'm just hurtin' niggas feelings (niggas feelings) 
And still chillin' on Simpson and Center Hillin' 
Made provisions for the click and continue keepin' it pimpin' 
Whether crack was in the house or record sales went through the ceilin' 
So say what you want, and do what you please]
But for fun, I shoot 22 from ya shoe to ya knees
I run a record label and a crew of Gs 
So, niggas'll come and look for you if I sneeze 
Or even breathe the wrong way 
You better do what the song say 
And Be Easy, else it'll be a long day

(I'm a king) You pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams 
(I'm a king) Top topic of all of your magazines 
(I'm a king) Head of the body, leader of the team 
(I'm a king) Remember I can get your block knocked dawg 
(I'm a king) A Bentley coupe with the top chopped off

It's a mess when you flex, let's take away your belt 
Leave you stretched on the whips, take your head off your neck 
Shit I feel like Sha Po', I'll roll more or less (more or less) 
45s in my slets, I ride for the set 
You ain't live as a Tekk, assault rifle of a boy 
I treat 'em like pets, solid gold bullets 
I'll kill you with finesse (shh), this is not a test 
Desert Es at your request, it's poppin' all that shit, now what do you suggest?

To play in the NBA with MP and the rest

So I signed the contract and did what I had to do
It was a dream come true for a youngster like me
Playing with veterans like DA, Ron Mercer and P
Mom and dad, ??? in the waste they not
They think I should go to college and forget the shot
This is somethin I wanted to do ever since I was small
??? is the key and all I want is to play ball
I got a killer crossover that why'all might not like
Shake em up, I play ball but I'm bad on the mic
Papa told me don't stop till I get to the top

For the love of the tank my slam and my shots be No Limit
The skills that kill, on the court or the battlefield
Show my talent and separate the fake from the real
Players get chills and lay still on the be ball court
CBA, NBA or rappin, that's my sport
Take my shine and get it on what's rightfully mine
Got the game to make you stop, pause the tape and rewind

Where the leaders live in a house of a lie like Don Chito
That's now, and still see non believers
And I hear what's great of covers affair for dying divas, what?
What kind of celebrating do you like to do?
A right to passage or the flashing lights that's blinding you
Haters you, wanna bring you down cause you trying to
Have a good day like O’Shea back in ‘92
Giving myself a minus to, bounce like the beat I'm rhyming to
If I see you got the devil up inside of you
Name another rider who, will provide you with the truth
Or keep tighter than the bodies do
That's why they try to take him out like Chinese food
Cause of the special delivery, it’s a sign of the fertility, dead like shvelry

In the middle of the night
Bottom of the world
But the view ain’t that bad
From where I stand
‘Cause I can still see the stars
Behind the smog
And I ain’t giving up just yet on finding God

Excited of simple things like dimples in my girl’s back
She told me to hold her tightly but I’m wonderin where the world’s at
Stuck in the middle of nowhere, given a chance I wouldn’t turn back
I’d rather be broke than turning on people who had it when I was hurt bad
Some real shit
So I write like it was a key to unlock the holds inside of it there
Potential of what it could be
Fight to keep this life free as the stars
Because not even we could speak of what we could become
Given a week away from harm, let’s be sure that can start
A hungry writer from his heart turned into dark like his odds not even a spark
And when he heat up in this cold
Mess light up in this alone
This hole is the only thing I can hold on
2 nowadays as they begin to blur
My dreams are being more than I fiend begin to stir
From my need to be content inside of myself
To inspire inspite of my doubt

[Chorus]

Life only a dull reflection of death
So I ride, I need to make the best of what’s left
Living fast but none the less I’m dying slowly
And my heart just an engine and my mind is only just a spark plug
And I think I need a jumpstart
No matter where I turn I’m headed for the junkyard
Don’t want my time back
Who do I need to speak to
Bout everything I’ve been through for me to be who I am
Does anyone even know whether we die? Hello
You know that we never come back, right?
Ayo, anyone get the reply? Uh
Anyone livin their mind tellin me there’s a Messiah
Send some more than sky, huh?
Something I hope that you’re right
You really believe that, you really gon read that book literally
And then I need that, you never thought that maybe it could be history
Telling me that and then tell you I disagree
I’ll tell you the truth, it all just sounds like some bullshit to me

I… I’ll never believe in no god
But I believe in the skies
And when I die, I die

Buckle new, polished all my real shit
Adapt to whatever’s cracking

Gentleman and a scholar
So the money straight range from hood to white collar
By any means, this is the theme I will follow
M.O.P. forever the team, our honor
You niggas said you’re bottled up and stuck out on drama
We’re trues for the life, running tears from your mama

Setting the 21 edition, I just follow tradition
I remember when snitches got stitches
Nowadays those kids don’t care, they say them shits gonna hit ‘em
Too late, you get the clap and send that kick home square
That’s a lifetime cost and that shit don’t heal
And I’m not through the bullshit, my life style is in the city rules
Coincided with innocent and blues

She told me come through and don’t forget the foreplay

She got me tempted to taste it like it’s gourmet
Honey drippin slow like that Ohio playa’s album cover
Or like some sorbet in the middle of summer heat
No shelter went underneath of that fountain from her
She love me and like her back
I swear we make a perfect match
Got my hand on the bible flat

Stretch to the kings

P-Money,"Hmm let me go,
To see my family.
Please Father let me go,
As my mother sleeps.

I don't know about days gone,
But round here nobody lives twice.
When your gone, your gone, without no bye,
Cause only a judge can give you life.
This is my advice,
Trust me, I nearly lost my life.
3 weeks after I got this ride
It seems like I had too much wine.
Which that I I didn't get one,
Anyway, I was going to the [?] booked for a set,
Even though I didn't have a set one.
Skream hit the decks, I was like check one.
Put on a show, but it weren't my best one.
Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination,
Then I was off to the next one,
20 minutes later I was on the M1,
Tired.
But I kept on going,
Fell asleep without even knowing.
No emotion in my face,
No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going.
Woke up,
Lorry,
Flash,
Panic,
Break,
Skid,
Crash,
Skidded,
More,
Bang,
Smash,
Out,
Cold,
Ribs,
Cracked,
Ouch.
I was in so much pain,
Crawled out of a Megane that now looked like a Mini,
When I was still on the first lane.
Baffled, didn't even know my name.
Fainted, too much shock in my brain.
Surrounded by paramedics and feds,
Trying to get up but fainted again.

See I just want you to take a second, hear me out.
Don't think I'm happy cause I smile when you see me out.
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared,
Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go,
To see my family,
And keep it inside,
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps.
Save my soul,
Please Father let me go.
Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps.

Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open,
I can hear voices and my phone ringing.
Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning,
One of the worst situations I've been in.
I can hear all of the angels singing.

But when it stopped humming,
My brain turned on, stared running.
Still in pain, but it started numbing,
The stone cold comeback I made was stunning.
I still tried to do a few shows cause I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming.
But I was left with a permanent problem,
Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (inside).
Ever so cunning,
6 weeks later, jogging and running.
I used the first aid kit like a drum set,
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming.
Trust me, when it comes to mistakes,
You can't afford to let one in.
Never done dream for a while,
The pipeline was blocked,
So I learnt and done a bit of plumbing.
They say tomorrow never dies,
But he forgot to tell you 'you can'.
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang,
But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam.
You can try beg for another,
Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show,
Thinking 'I just wanna see my brother',
Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, Runner.

I just want you to take a second, hear me out.
Don't think I'm happy cause I smile when you see me out.
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared.
Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go,
To see my family.
And keep it inside,
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps.
Save my soul,
Please Father let me go.
Keep me safe.",Family,2011
P-Money,"In a time of the fallen lore
Only two powers governed the land
Good and evil

Oozing knives, super swab
But I see my mack black soaked up, super cut
Ever see that I’m ruthless and this one is a smash hit
Bubble straight through the glass
They ain’t touchin' me ‘cause I ain’t never runnin'
Sickened to my name and category, I ain’t number onin
Worst case scenario, is it won’t be a target
The message stood a happy ending, I’m coming
Come in and stop spraying through a keyhole
Wanna see me win this fight against evil
The tarots are only preying on the weak
I’ll have em on their knees in the long hall, cathedral
Yea, my head and mind drugged
They’re blowing it all the time but never when I flop
Sway fever, but it’s like hay fever
Eyes are wide open whenever I drop

I’m a savior here to save you
I’m a problem too, frustrating you
I’m all night here to contain you
I’m the part that’s still in plain view

For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction

Oh shut up, I’ll introduce myself
I’m flowing like a Pitbull
I’ve the nark, its pung flying as a fistful
I’m the shore where the kids wanna watch
I’ve got the power to make them stay up late and miss school
Girls are like ah, in school
Confusing nothing about me, simple
I’m a bad mother shut your mouth
I’d trust the girls and give all the pretty ones raincoats
I’m so great, flying around with no cape, I’m so baked
I graffiti my name on sky scrapers
Heroes tell me to stop, I’m like shut up, gon' hate
I use my power for entertainment
Some of mind the way I gave a you’re an orgasm in home base
Why you gotta take my dog? get your own date
Why you’re here in my galaxy? get your own place

(I’m a savior here to save you
I’m a problem too, frustrating you)

I’m a savior here to save you

I’m gonna need a riot squad to help control my breathing
Communicating with basses like I can hear it speaking
He says when you got off in a rave, it will not last this evening

In and out of consciousness, reclining like a car seat
Rat tat tat, all I hear is my hearing depleting
Cameras flashing, I’m getting tickets, my pulse is speeding

Find a way to stop this, save me from the darkness

Trying me hardest just to regain control (struggle)
But I feel my ears going towards the radio (struggle)
To save my old life, I’d probably have to stop listening
But I can’t stop, it’s like I swore to take an oath
Punchlines hard enough to break my nose
Sounding so serious, I don’t think it could take a joke
I could be in my bed, out cold
Dead to the world but then it’s like I feel the music raise my pulse

So you really can't budge a nigga' you oughta love a nigga
For the fact that it's my world and my life but still I'm a rugged nigga
They say you buggin' nigga, fuck it, I'm a thuggin' nigga
You talkin bullshit then kick it with another nigga
I got a bigger bed and I need a cover nigga
And I ain't got friends - I got enemies
So if they with me, then that means they my brother nigga

[Chorus]

Is a blunt to the head, a prayer for the dead
Run around hustlin', scared of the feds
They said death is eternal sleep
But the only thing is you ain't really sure if you prepared for the bed
So often we get merked in the head, instead of big money
They got big momma hurtin' instead
My life is makin' the verse, but the handcuffs
The bullpens, the jail cells is makin' it worse
Tell mom I don't go to the church, tell Oc' I don't' go to mas
I blow blunts, hold guns, and I'ma be right there when the soldiers'll march
I play the part, and my heart seem colder than March
But on the flipside of things, it's still warmer than June
I have talks with the Lord and he'll be callin' me soon, what
And my life is all I have, my family, my niggas, my flow, my grabs what

I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone
But, chicks don't romance me, don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy, that's not what my plans be
I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go to trips at the Lancy, trip to the Grammy's cause
Most of these girls be confusing me
I don't know if they really love me or they using me
Maybe is the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
'Cause you was depressed and now you abusing me
That's why I need a girl that be true to me
Know bout the game, and know how to do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit I ruin me
Forget the word girl it's just you and me

Now let's ride

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life

Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo, now I have had a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hood rat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cell phones and beepers, and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
'Cause now I'm getting money and the game getting deeper
I want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with
I need somebody I can build with
I need somebody I can hold tight
Winter time and the fall lives snow white
Anytime we together feel so right
You the girl I been looking for my whole life
God bless me, I'm glad I got the insight
Because of you girl, now I understand life

I need a girl

I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really want to
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's style
This shit is wild
All damn days that I reminisce
About the way I used to kiss them pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

P. Diddy,"Intro:
Uh
This is what I sound like after 5 years
(You back kid)
Why do I feel like I still got the floor
(You back kid, Bad Boy for real, Let's go)

Verse 1:
Before '99 I was born again
5 years later I'm on again
Man I think I'm born to win
Mase broke, that's an oxy moron
Forget a bus, I brought a drop to tour on
G-4's What I soar on, uh
You thinkin' I ain't hot you so wrong
Sorry for the prolong
But now life goes on
Long list of hits and it goes on
I wake up, and I don't even feel like a star
And man I'm getting a million a bar
Indeed I need not take no lie
Man, ya'll gonna make me cry
It's kinda eerie when you hear me
Ya hairs stand up
Been a change of plan
Rip your old plan up
Instead of hatin'
Help me lift the big man up (As we proceed...come on...yeah)

Chorus:
Awake these people up and show them they keep dreamin'
Breathe, Stretch, Shake, let it go
Breathe, Stretch, Shake, let it go
Wake these people up and show them they keep dreamin'
(Betha I love this one...endeavor, for real, Bad Boy)
Breathe, Stretch, Shake, let it go
Breathe, Stretch, Shake, let it go

Verse 2:
Some days I make thousands
Some days I make millions
Spend my day chillin
Coupe's with suede ceilings
Everybody out there wanna know what Mase got
Way hot gray drop Maybach gray yacht (Whoooo)
And that's just the way it be
Favor, people wanna pay for me
When I'm in Mr. Chows, they waive the fee
And I don't chase money man
Money chase me
I give my wife things that she dream and more
I give a little bit, and she fiend for more (lets go)
I'm back like Moses to bring the law (Come on)
Brand new saint Mase in mean velour
I had bling before you ever seen the tour
Fans from Iran and Singapore
And grown men beg me to bring them on tour
Even if it mean they gotta sleep on the floor (Let's Go!!)

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
I used to be the guy stood next to Diddy
Crucified for bringin sex in the city
Even though the girls think I'm extra pretty
How I know? I ain't got no extra wit me, oh
With the fist tight flow
Wit a wrist like whoa
What if this might blow
Ain't no if I...Know
I'm the man to plan the way
This ain't my life
I've become a saved (Say what)
Put up a good fight
Like its mandalay
Hate the game, but it made a man a man
Gone for a while, its like I ran away
God tI'me now, and I don't plan to play
I'm only here for the one thing you lack
And make dj's scratch is he is he back
Kids in the hood stutter it's a it's a fact
It's the kid resurrected it's a it's a wrap
(As we proceed, to give you what you need, he's back)

(chorus x2)

AHHHHHHH!","Breathe, Stretch, Shake",
P. Diddy,"Peep the scripts
Scope honey from the whips
Jumped out like yo!
Who the fuck you with
Flash the jewels cause that's the rule
Damn I like a girl who spend a little cash for her shoes
Face natural, Can I get at you?
Saw a spot on the body look nice with a tattoo
With my name, but didn't want to jump the gun
I Didn't Know how many niggas was humping hon
I said I never seen a face like yours before
And I been around some cute whores before
That either me or my boys tore it up before
So I'm hoping you different
Let you push the 6
And give you a different life and
Baby if it's right jump on it in the morning
And ride it 'til the night
Want to buy you I'll jewelery when it hits the light
Bitches will momentarily lose they sight

I know what boys like
I know what they want
I know what boys like, boys like
I know what boys like
I know what they want
I know what boys like, boys like me

So I'M a cutie with a booty like OW!
Deeper than the MOW!
Earrings Shine like,
I'm a real bitch so you know I do real things
Only real bitches live like queens, get it?
Safety deposit in the walk-in closet
Marvel fortress with matching Rolls Royce's
In the driveway from Monday to Friday
I be the richest, shitting on these bitches
While chickens cluck giving up the butt
I blaze the cut with the daddy raw buff
You can call me a slut
Who gives a fuck
That's fine nigga shit
I'm a good with mine
I can tell by your shoes you know what I want
Fuck a prenup give me half up front
My sex be the best so we split these CARS
You can stop saying mine
And start saying ours

I know what girls like
I know what they want
They want to sex me
They think I'm sexy
I know what girls like, girls like me

I know what boys like
I know what they want
They want to sex me
They think I'm sexy
I know what boys like, boys like me

Got the bomb place, fireplace John Blaze
Victoria Secret lingerie
Ice like Don King
The price was like 8 digits a long way, shit
Got the beachfront view
V 1 2
Cop you one cop me one too
On the place, jet ski's parked by the lake
No neighbors, make all the noise you want to make
Invite your friends over
LET THEM make their way through
The Benz's and the Rovers before they reach the door
Vacay, away, a week or more
First class to and fro, freaking off
Got the Hamptons locked
Champagne popped
Cruise around the world 'til the damn thing stop
Cop rembrandt, handle, pay the lot
Can't complain, we balling, true or not?

All my niggas, take a walk with me
You ain't gotta holla, you can talk with me
Just try to learn where my thoughts can be and how I stack figures
Learn why I'm real, still that nigga
I get money, I ain't gotta do a crime
Shit, I hit dimes, what I need with a nine
Before y'all judge me, be clear
We got nothing but heat here, beware, we here

I smash it, I don't harass it

It's right around eleven o'clock

Asked you how you look, are you ready?
You tell her you look hot
Not to worry at all

Oh, (Oh!) It's gonna be a show down, knock down, drag down, gun slinger shoot 'em up

You must have thought you had game, now you, what?
Walkin' 'round, like you're down, you don't give a?
But you don't really want to be forgot into the streets,
I'm a lover, not a fighter, but I crack your teeth
Boy I plead please, no, don't bother me.
'Cause when you had me you ain't know how to chill wit' me
You want to be in the streets with the freak-nies
But now you all up on them knees, still joggin' me.
But I'm gonna say it real, real, keep it real, 
What the deal? How you feel? Is it real? Is you sick?
'Cause I'm the deal, still here, what the feelin' 
Is real, don't front, 'cause boy I'm the?
I'm doin' better without you, playa, and I'm happy without you,playa,
This song is about you, playa
Motha f***** son of a gun, Janet!

Got a chip upon your shoulder, I just knocked it off,
Show me what you're gonna do, I ain't ?bout to run,
You have just run out of ammunition,
Shootin' blanks now, you son of a gun.

Missy, Janet, Carly

Oh, (Oh!) Who you gonna give it to? Who you gonna steal it from?
who's your next victim? (That's right now)
Oh, (Oh!) Who you gonna lie to? Who you gonna cheat on? 
Who you gonna leave alone? (That's what I'm talkin' about)
Oh, (Oh!) What you gonna tell her, after she discovers, you don't really love her?
Oh, (Oh!) It's gonna be a show down, knock down, drag down, gunslinger shoot 'em up

No, no, no, no, no, it's not what you say, it's what you do you're so vain,
You probably think this song is about you,
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you.

I betcha think this song is about you,

I betcha think this song is about you,
I betcha think this song is about you,

Let me tell you something

Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
I was on 1-2-5 and Saint Nich
Chillin' with these chick
Named Tondalea
Was a hot girl and everybody wanted to slay her
She wasn't fond of players
Only wanted ballers
To spoil her
Six figures and camcorders
So what you trying to tell me dear
I got Bentley, Benz send in Mr. Belvedere
I just want to blow your mind
I'm talkin' literally blow your mind
My repratoir is Menage Trois
And exotic cars chilling with the hottest stars
And it ain't no stopping this
I can't help it I'm an optomist
And Ima make ya head bop to this
And at the end you gon rock to this
Now say my name

Its the D the I the D the D the Y
The D the I the D

It's the D the I the D the D the Y
The D the I the D
Its Diddy, (Hold Up), It's Diddy (Say What!)

Ay yo, I came in the door
I said it before
I never the ladiez hyptonize me no more
But, back to the manuscript
'Cause I don't think you can handle this
From New York to Los Angles
I think the whole world scandalous
I'm just trying to keep the candles lit
Make the party people dance to this
Get out your seat and clap your hands to this
Cause I came too far
For me to be bouswar
It's a Bently to you, to me it's a blue car
So Branson pass me a jar
Cause these cats done went too far
One phone call send two cars
And still get searched by security guards
I guess that's what I have to do
Take the game international
Now what you call me

(La La La La La La La La La La La La)
C'mon work it out girl
I'm trying to see you work it out girl
(La La La La La La La La La La La La)
C'mon work it out girl
I wanna see you work it out girl

Now hold up, stop, wait a minute
We don't stop we rock cause ain't a limit
My aim is winning
Got asian women
That'll change my linen
After I done blazed and hit em
But I just wanna rock wit you
And take it straight to the top with you
And do what I gots to do
If it's possible
Cause I ain't trying to stop you boo
I got an agenda
Got on a ninja
One wheelin' and killin' it not to offend ya
That's when I met this chick named Brenda
Tender, her whole body bend like fender
So let me see you shake it girl
I just wanna see you shake it girl
For the return of the don
The world in my palm
My mom calls me Sean
But y'all call me

Everyday she had tears in her eyes for me
I caught a case shorty took the whole ride for me (Thank you)
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl we was like brothers
On late nights we would play fight under covers
Now you gone can't love you like I really want to
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would have had my child
A pretty little girl with Diddy style
Shit is wild, now these days that I reminisce
About my little mami I'ma always miss (I miss you)

Some in it for the love and some want the dough
But some of them confused and don't really know
The difference between a woman and a silly ho
But on the low

'Cause I be chillin' where the young willies be
Strip clubs, sit buzzed spend twenty G's
Shit bugged stick dubs where they titties be

Yo shorty all on me little hot tamale

Wide big Lincoln, why's this guy on the side for the stinking?
Watch task force dash forward lookin marveled
It's a big chance, big pants, might guard him

Strictly pimping, as long as tricks invest in women
From the Memphis Tenn., to the N-why-see I'm representing
I put mo' spice into yo' life than yo' entire kitchen
Big dicking, choking hoes with anaconda
If my pimping was a drink it'd be a can of Thunder
I slang lumber, a spell I keep my women under
Through all seasons, they fall winter spring and summer
I hit the highway smoked out pistol gripping
But I ain't tripping though I'm high as hell, spaceship'n

I'm on the run from the law (oh that's crazy)
These fools runnin' up and chickens raw (oh that's crazy)
It's a g from the streets (oh that's crazy)
That fool working with the police (oh that's crazy)
Don't bring that fool around me no more (oh that's crazy)
And to think he tried to sell me some glo (oh that's crazy)
Good thing I had my head on straight (oh that's crazy)
So I'ma snake his little freak on a date (oh that's crazy)
Went straight to the mizzel, tizzel (oh that's crazy)
I drove straight past my hizzel, dizzel (oh that's crazy)
It's a slizzel nizzel fa shizzel (oh that's crazy)

Don't worry about it dun I'm on the next thing smoking
Hit Bristal up on the speed dial
Yo these funny talking cats tryin' to do a nigga foul
It's goin' down nigga round up the team
I'm'll head over here just to map out the scene
Ship them things in route to climb walls
Infrared vision ear plugs and all
Digital surveillance linked with laptops
Express mail it to me can't ???

I'm splurtin' for certain Bris-pro working
Searchin' dippin' curvin' breakin' clean outta virgin
From servin' here Rob certain I'm burnin'
On my way from Mt. Vernon
Swervin' a stretch bourbon

Hey yo we gotta get him

Or who sent them
First nigga to find them better bend'em

Shit ain't a game, and Sean feel the same
So why'all niggas betta get on point

Well it seems like our bad boys have theirselves in a bit of a jam

Yo, who the fuck is this pagin' me at eight forty six

Sense of urgency on the cell
We gon' pick you up, when ya flight land
We in a tight jam
Me and Diddy fam sorta like his right hand
I touch down like two-thirty
If i was on you, your hoe's and them cowards I'm'll do dirty
Still a commssion and we all equal
All lethal
Caught'em doin' dirt to the wrong people
It's the family affair, I'm here
With all of me I'm'll deal with this one accordingly
Got the locations sittin' in the console pacin'
Get bagged murder be the case and
And I'm tired in jail
Even though through the riots I prevailed
Enjoyin' my freedom, got two kids as long as I feed'em
I'm here for the fam that's there when I need'em

[Mark Curry]
Yo, uh uh uh, hello
It gotta be the same cats
I can tell by they strange acts
When they mumble to each other
Like Milan they run for cover
New 'cause this bitch that I fucked with
One thought I loved her
Seas debate the storm pull him the the surface
That's a purpose
One of these faces, make'em nervous
Catch'em when they out for hamburgers
Turn they whole lunch into a murder
In a way all the rounds gon' be heard of
This shits big, the first thing to catch to where PD is
I'm on it, act like they want it
I'm'll bring the heat
Just let me know the place we plan to meet
And I'm in it sure as your heart beat

[Loon]
Yo I ain't really tryin' to duck no strays
So watch what the fuck you say
It's ya mouth that started the shit
Now you actin' all retarted and shit
Dog I came to play my part and that's it
We had a fullproof plan, all we need was the fam
Ammunition, a van, two chicks and one extra man
Two lincoln LS Sedans
Fifteen hundred yards of saran
And after the scam, we be out in Amsterdam
Yo, call Sean in Milan
Call Sean tell Sean we gone
We'll meet him in Hong Kong
With two chicks both they thongs on
Mabe Ling and Kim Long
Both of them dead wrong
Two rich bitches the feds on

[P. Diddy]
Yeah, well it seems like brother Loon is out in Hong Kong
He's found his self in a sticky icky icky situation
But you know somethin' I have faith in the bad boys
Bad boys bring it on home, bring it on home bad boys

Heh, I'm bout to do Santa Dimengo
On a horse named Bingo
A fugitive lookin' for Puff switchin' my lingo
Stayin' at a hotel called the pink flamingo
Callin' up MC from a cuatro cinco
The set up, tryin' on my way to uniform
Room service bumpin' Kain on the newest song
Holdin' gats knowin' everything I do is wrong
'Till I hi-jack the sky flyin' on a unicorn
Downstairs with a bag of money and two clips
Talkin' to Loons chicks wit' sombreros and toothpicks
Sayin' they commit homicides for two bits
And fuck for dough like I give two shits
Wildfire call from Hong Kong
Hello (Loon: Yo Kain I just spotted Sean Jean)
Hold up, some information was missing
I just got the same page from Bris
He told me he saw Sean and two chicks followed by four whips
Somewhere in the Florida sticks
It's a set up
Tell the crew to keep their heads high
I'm gonna flip if any one of my mens die
We've been fucked somebody told us a bent-lie/Bentley (what?)
Let's get back to the spot in NY
Seven glocks P-S-P-O pops
Hit both the hot locks
Let'em read it that Diddy is on them hot blocks
So we sent two teams to rush both spots
Ha yeah!
Suited up ready to dumbs out
Thumbs out watch the motherfuckin' door with our guns out

Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me that everything is going my way

Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibilities
Has the whole world opened for me
That's why I'm feeling...

I'm feeling so good
I knew I would
Been taking care of myself

Can bring me down
Nothing in this world gonna turn me round...

And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine
Like the stars above I'm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine
'Cause I'm loving life
And tonight's for feeling...

And I know it ain't about the chips
Just my way of sayin' thanks for the years you put up with my shit
I had to change like the chorus said
And I'm reminded why every time we do our thing in the waterbed
To me this is more than head

Took the time out to make things right
It may seem nice

Hey yo I'm back by popular demand and shit
Niggaz want the crown but can't handle it
This rap game's getting scandalous
I done lost my best friend in Los Angeles

My other nigga turned Evangelist
But I can't quit cause I'm on some Evander shit
Fuck the money and the white sand and shit
When it's said and done you gunna understand this shit

Your man talking about Hummers and little cars
That only fit in his little house little garage
His lifestyle is just a little mirage
He the type of cat that never had a menage

Backrub, you know a little massage
Tight shit you get when you Head Nigga in charge
I'm in the Rolls listening to the bars
Leaned back wit a chick smoking on cigars

From Bogota, Colombia, chicks from Panama
The diamond fellow, mami hello
Pull up in the drop my Ferrari yellow
Pull off your top make it shake like Jello
(Lenny Kravitz)
Drop everything! When you walk in the door
Free your self 'fore get ya ass on the floor!
Ah be a maniac-ah! lose control (just lose control)
Get naked! Strip down to your soul!

Well strip down! (work)
Show me some more! (work)
Is that all you got?! (work)
You got to make me believe it girl! (work)

Staring at my chain I kicked off your Jimmy Choos

That Rolls Royce Phantom, it ain't no joke ma
Weed brownie at 2, but I will not smoke ma
Don't talk about licking if it ain't deepthroat ma

I give you great dick, I make your face flip
Then take ya aboard a nigga Spaceship
Star Trak, my fault I mean Mother Ship
Put on the cameras, try it you'll be loving it

And you can bring your girl and we can get on another tit
Me? I'm a Mount Airy fellow
Or down in Florida wit the Maranello
Driving slow watch the mami mouthing ""hello""

Get wit ya man if you want love you better
Trying to get +Dirty+ like +Aguilera+
Yep, he's a skater the kids that's rhyming
But I'm also young and rich wit a big ass diamond

Hey yo my intro's crazy, I'm in a new Mercedes
Rocks the same colors as daisy's
Why'all niggaz is lazy, I'm on my j-o-be	
And that's why ya hate on me

And power from here to upstate
Why'all sweet as cupcakes
So why niggaz stay wit tough faces?
I stay trying to figure what Loon and Puff make

Bitch please! you ain't been in a helicopter
Flying 'round Jesus statue wit a mountain in Brazil
Bitch please! you ain't never been to Guatemala
Eating shrimp by the dollar taking flights to Negril

Bitch please! and you ain't been wit Lenny and Pharrell
Me and Loon in the hills giving mami's the chills
Bitch please! and you ain't never seen a hotter nigga in the game

Who better to usher you back through the gutter
Than America's number one hustler (Sean Carter)
Don't call it a come back
Unless there's some money attached to that
And you can call it whatever you like, in fact
It's something like a phenomenon
Like a young LeBron, gettin' my high school games on
TV just for dunkin' on
Whoever want it with Sean he can get it jumpin like Donkey Kong
We could get it thumpin' like bum-ba-bum
Travel the way of the gun, come on, see-come on
No, I'm not only beggin' I'm eggin' you on
Until you dead or gone that's the vendetta I'm on
This ain't no video game with wrestlers on it
The competitor on this is on some shit
Honest come through all black like a Amish
Holsters under the armpit, the arm spit, ha
Just that Brooklyn don shit
Along with the queen from Yonkers
Come on kiss the ring
Fore I let miss Mary sing
Supposed to you a soul in the everything, yeah
It's classic material
I see you bastards at the burial
Jay go first and then Mary go, round
I just ride, hold her down with the fifth by my side
Me and Miss Blige
Look up in the sky it's a bird and the 'caine
And the hydro flow that I brought to the game
I could go mo' but I'm a let ma do her thang
Brooklyn, we did it again

'Cause even before we hit the bedroom, I was friends with you
If they ask, I ain't gotta say whom in them interviews
My sweet thing, never believe them rumors that been a true
The fact I had numerous friends is true
But you was wifey could change me into a groom in a mintue, Boo
Maybe my sense of humor gets into you
But girl, they can make a perfume from the scent of you
I wanna take you where it feel like June in December, too
So what you think about Cancun 'til the winter through
I don't know what the other consumers you been with do
I put a day aside to go to Bloomies and spend with you
Like any other man, I woulda zoomed to the clinic, too
Now I wanna see if me and my junior's identical
A dude put a wound on the skin of you
I swear to everything that same afternoon will begin to move, feel me

Couple winter lodges, few summer homes
I'm there for every ooh, umm, and moan
And make sure when the new Hummer roams
The shoes come in chrome
I ain't new at buyin' white, yellow, and cucumber stones
That send chills through a woman bones
But life gets gruesome
Even though I got the kinda bread that won't matter if a few crumbs are blown
Flights I don' flew some alone
Now I wanna wake up every day with you in a new number zone
Mamamia it's you I'ma phone
Just to erase all the negative views from your dome
And I promise this fella's G
And so gangster it'll calm all that jealousy
And drama you tellin' me
So mama come yell at me
So I could put the top down and we could cruise like Tom and Penelope

Been around your girl believe I read faces
I can tell she don't want me prevail
But I, learn my lesson watchin' Sean bless it
So why listen to her and start guessin'?

But as long as we're here then we might as well shine together
Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that a last forever
So let's stop the pain, stop the rain
Put, stress to rest girl stop the games
Name the spot, mommy I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the range
Ma I got some thangs, knowned to put rocks in rings
Push a hundred foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever been to St.Tropez?
Or seened a brotha play a Mandalay?

No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin', do I believe in?
Love you till the day I stop breathin', I love you girl

Hard

Yea yea sittin' looking out my window the streets I see ain't pretty
Sometimes I wonder if I was born rich with plenty
Money, and everyday was sunny didn't no rain fall
Life was beautiful like the colors of a rainbow
Would I be the same prim row all my niggas know
If I didn't have to learn to beat them streets and get that dough
What if I never witnessed killings with my own two eyes
Bussin' leave they own folks layin' in the street to die
Life without respective if every second I was shakin'
Cause I injected dope in my veins
Divide and strain could I describe pain could I
Describe livin' life without desire mayne
Could I survive if I couldn't rap or entertain alive
And free you can't beat it
Who can you blame my world is like a picture and the frame
The picture might change but the frame stays the same

Hustling waiting on tomorrow
Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

What if you was on the other end of the bullet
When a killer wanna pull it would it seem like
The light flash in front of your face
Or would you run real slow like I ran in my dream like
Just the other day I tried to be a hero but it wasn't the side of me
Or maybe it just wasn't the time to be but if the shoe had to fit then I would be
Ahead of the game playin' the part I bring it all into the light from out of the dark
I hit the bat into the ball and out of the park
And live with the question alone that's meddlin' hard
What if you had to live under the bridge and do anything just to feed your kids
Think about that and the deed you did the first thing that impress me kid
Oh yes you did and I ain't even tryna choke your chain or pull your leg
And I ain't even tryna fuck with your head and I ain't even tryna sweat this shit
Just spit these messages cause I'm blessed with it
What if you had the chance to be able to switch hands with me or anyone you see
And if you really wanna take it deep this shit not quanum to me
For one and each and each and all for the sci-fi mat more religious superstitious
Politicious and all the listeners with us this shit be cold as Christmas
So put your head to the sky say a prayer for the sick and the old the young and the weak
For the bombs and the single moms with six kids askin' for something to eat

Hustling waiting on tomorrow
Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

And when you get up they seem to hold you down
Down to the ground gotta stay focused with your eyes opened wide
See the sun rise I keep my hands on the steering wheel when I'm creepin' up 75
(woo woo woo) changing lanes on the regular talkin' on my cellular fast
Watching cause they wanna take me away
I'm just trying to feed my babies face
But I'm just hustling I'm waiting on tomorrow

Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

And the only way is to keep your head on right

Her hair and her nails did show me love
Ya man say he got good green show me some bud
Give me the real hook up price like I'm ya 'cause
Baby see I'm above the bullshit and the playing
Them hoes you listening to don't know what they saying
They relaying that he say she say language
If that's the way we trying to swing it won't swing it

Just want to add something new to the list

What it do baby girl
Get on the dance floor

Money make the world go round that's what they say
Conversation rules the nation in every way
My mind thinking shit and I say it before I know
I'm at the condo busting condoms on the floor
We keep the crunk hyper than any who use a mic
We do the kinda music the pretty women gone like
A sweet smell you know with perfect nails and toes
A round cinnabun head under them clothes
I know you want to go and smoke out
Stay up all night and go eat at the Waffle House
You and me bring your friend that make three
I bet I can make you feel so sexy
Let the drank flow and burn the best dro
Put ya drank down and go hit the dance floor
Make a nigga want to get with you and spend dough
Love what you do to me mami I want to know

She'll suck a nigga dick for the flight but don't bite
We gone keep it on the low no gossip and no hype

My rubber on tight on the jet on the runway

Break a girl off that chain like Cunta Kintae

So will you dip with me baby girl
On a trip around the world while I play with your curls

Play with your titty nipples will that make your toes curl
You a bad motherfucker baby its your world

Dope crack that's going in the strip clubs tippin'

Fuck a blind date, oh no, I got to see her
The new millennium poet
Forever show it, can't blow it
If you reap it, you sow it

I, pay my, dues
And it's the rules that I play by
Carry the team like I'm A.I
I used to cook rocks, and hit the block

And gun in the bushes, and money in my sock
Shit, I had hoes way before I was nationally famous
I was in the hood strapped up good
Watchin' my anus

I'm a target splitter
The world strongest man hardest hitter
Even though you hate
I still elevate regardless nigga

Step to us boy, look what you done started
And we don't even care that your arsenal be the largest

Look, you niggaz play too much mayne
You need to pump yo' brakes
Keep a heater nigga need for them restless snakes
Right in my face caught a case tryin' to defend my space

Dodging snitches police niggaz jumping state to state
What kind of nigga run his mouth and snitch out everybody?
The kind of nigga that's gone end up being a dead body
Yo' wife and children gone be searching for their dear ol' daddy

They found his headless body tied up in a dark alley
It's cold like ice and snow on a nigga soul
For bricks or snow, niggaz will fuck you like a dirty hoe
Kick yo' door and put and your babies on the floor

See you in public fuck who with you let the thang go
A nigga tell you don't let business turn personal
Fuck what they say cause for gram a nigga hurtin' you
Niggaz out here hurtin' fool

Nothing is for free mayne
Fuckin' with the game
That's how that shit be mayne

[Verse 3: 8 Ball]
I was torn this bitch came from the streets I was born
Pussy like a little kitty back yellow as corn
I don't go around poppin' shit wit' niggaz who talkin'
Them niggaz ain't talkin' no more

Closed coffin
Not often do you see a nigga loyal as I
Like that boy from Best Eye nigga ready to die
For my bread and them niggaz that considered me family
Hold it down mayne I got you til we up there wit' granny

I'm still working with Diddy, still fuck wit the hood

[P. Diddy talking]",When It's On,2004
P. Diddy,"All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you


Don't let him sing you a sad song No baby
Waiting for love like this too long
You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby
All that you need I can give you
You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on
I do, satisfy you
You don't have to wait on him

I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

Security strapped, still stacking a million
It's doubt with the stallion, somethin' Italian
Or maybe Puerto Rican, you can catch me in Paris
I'm in it to win it but willing to carry

I buck clean about in a Phantom
The people go screaming like an opera anthem
I did it before, do it again
I got it to blow, got it to spin
Lies before, cool as the wind
Got hits go back like juice and gin, yea
Shine the best and diamond necklace

Because of you
And I'd be on the highway, if only I could leave my place
Because of you
I used to be a talker but I ain't got nothing good to say
Because of you
An I been trying to hide but it's written all over my face
So I

I really thought you were the one, the only one
I guess that I was wrong
And you turned out you wasn't it

What can you say when it's said and done

Yeah uh uh I remember that first day that I saw her face
The feeling I had sorta felt like my birthday
Beautiful I must say
She was my earthquake
Cute face, nice shape, she made my earth shake
I'm a try an keep the faith, do it like the church say
She the one for me and I don't care what him or her say
Thought I had a home run
But I'm just at first base I found out the long run
Just another heart break
So how much can my heart take
You was like air to me
You know I wouldn't leave, I needed you to breath
See life is but a dream, so is love and I believe
If you ever been in love you would know what I mean yeah
So lord help me please I wanna see the light
She keep telling me I'm wrong but I know I'm right
But trying to ignore cause I don't wanna fight
I know I make mistakes
But still I need her in my life

Tell me how I'm supposed to heal this open wound
Because of you
And tell me who woulda thought that id ever be trying to get over you
I'm stuck in the moment, of memories of me and you
And I can get over it, but I ain't sure if I want to
Cause you dun made your bed, now you gotta lie in it
You gotta lie in it babe
Now all the things you said don't mean a thing
Don't mean a thing to me now
I can't believe I gave you one, last, shot
I let it ride now baby it's your stop
Oh so so leave
Now the jokes on me
It took a while to finally come to my senses
But what
What do you do, what do you do after love? oh
What can you say ..what can you say when it's said and done
When its over, oh
Cause you can't hide a heart break

(i know you hear me..listen to me (please)
This is what you made me do
Pay attention
She know who I'm talking to, and I know you listening
I think about you all the time, if not every minute
I promise hurting you was never my intention
Something bout your style, the way that you presented her

I apologize for every time that you might have cried
There's not enough words to describe how I feel inside

I always knew you woulda made a beautiful bride
And that's why
I wish you could of stayed, so much
But I fucked up, an went and betrayed your trust (you know)
There's no more Dolce Gabbana, Gucci, Prada, trips to Nevada
And I admit what you probably heard was true
But outta of all these girls the only one I loved was you
I love you

You know I love you more then anything tho

I really feel I can do anything
I really truly believe in God that way
So much that I believe in myself

You know
He would stop at nothing to achieve his goal

It's Bad Boy, bitch
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it (It feels good to be back, I missed ya)
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
And I roll with the sounds of B-B-E
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it (You know what time it is, report to the dance floor)
It's bad boy, bitch (Talk to 'em)

See you out the corner of my eye
Leaning on the wall, looking fly
I want you to come be with me
You're the only one I wanna talk to
But I don't wanna rush

I'm here, when will you make your move?
I see you, I am me, I want cha, why don't cha
Come to me? I can be what you need, uh baby
I'm standing, been waiting, I'm yearning, I'm burning
Get to know me, come and get to know me
Come to show me that you wanna know me

You know who it is, I'm back in the building
Security strapped, still stacking a million
It's doubt with the stallion, somethin' Italian
Or maybe Puerto Rican, you can catch me in Paris
I'm in it to win it but willing to carry
The game, if you think I'm not, look at the carats
I buck clean about in a Phantom
The people go screaming like an opera anthem
I did it before, do it again
I got it to blow, got it to spin
Lies before, cool as the wind
Got hits go back like juice and gin, yea
Shine the best and diamond necklace
My extravagant taste, the style perplexes
They know I'm the ish, they wanna get next
That's why she had to fit 'cause she wanted to get next

I'm here, when will you make your move?
I see you, I am me, I want cha, why don't cha
Come to me? I can be what you need, uh baby
I'm standing, been waiting, I'm yearning, I'm burning
Get to know me, come and get to know me
Come to show me that you wanna know me

Anywhere I appear, they all stop and stare
Admire your body language, speaking loud and clear like (I want you to come be with me)
She be waiting, anticipating for oh so long
Fantasizing wild thoughts of me coming on like (I'm here, when will you make your move?)
She digging my style, my swag, my suede, my swerve
My way with words, the Boy's absurd for sure
You can't fall till my aura called
I make miracles like I walk on water
What you want, mama, order, it's on my tab
I'm so bad with the cash, I dropped the whole bag
Where you at, girl?

I'm here, when will you make your move?
I see you, I am me, I want cha, why don't cha
Come to me? I can be what you need, uh baby
I'm standing, been waiting, I'm yearning, I'm burning
Get to know me, come and get to know me
Come to show me that you wanna know me

I'm here right now, can't wait no more, no
You were the one who stole my heart
Can't you see the wait is over?
I need you to come closer
Please believe is getting stormy
You really got me hot

I see you, I am me, I want cha, why don't cha
Come to me? I can be what you need, uh baby

Gold pieces moulded with Jesus features, 
Give streets the fever from the way I spit the Ether,
Came on the scene at 19 a gritty fiend for, 
Money, power, respect, get it by any means uh,
New Yorker, slick talker, walk like a brick flipper,
Decimal doctor, multiply to get richer,
I'm a entrepreneur, I'm the heart of the city,
I'm a part of the sewers, I'm the honorable diddy,
I taste the dirt in my sweat, that's from the Harlem struggle, 
All in my swagger that's the reason why I got my hustle,
I got the highest stature, Miami diamond flasher,
I got you caught in the most flyest and stylish rapture,
My signature next to Christopher Wallace, get it honest, 
My first album through to him, that was my biggest project, 
Now I'm the illest known to walk like the illest soldier,
And when I smoke, only roll up with the illest doja
You sit and mull it over my venom a killer cobra,
It's Harlem USA I diddy bop and shop with Oprah,
(Yeah nigga, what.)

Nigga what,
From my voice I'm killing 'em,
I shed my blood,
About everything I love,

To the eye blacker, over handed face the palm smacker,
Good scrapper, cat stacker, good wood packer,
Tear up the Dom P wrappers faster,
Platinum patrone splasher, fuck cris, spit atcha,
I call it rich ignorant laughter,
Black American express card all grey now, its scratched up,
From constant usage, girl kidnapper, pop tags off tags, 
Poppa making monster music, and still I Costra Nostra, 
Big roaster, skin cola, girl when I send for ya,
Bring friends wontcha?
I'm from the 80's NYC 5 percent of culture,
Breeze through with that old school blue malaroma,
Wrist glowing, ho-ing, fly off in a Boeing, 
Slide off with your ho, and spend six figures on her, 
My persona, Sean John unforgivable cologne,
Copping the biggest diamonds makes me sorta bi-polar, 
Ferrari to Phantom, vehicles for high rollers,
The studded chain around my neck makes the night colder,
(Yeah nigga, what.)

Nigga what,
From my voice I'm killing 'em,
I shed my blood,
About everything I love,

The Queens Crypt keeper, Mets hat rocker, 
Pretty bitch slobber, Ex-robber,
Heister, my own life biographer,
Pants sagging, Bentley whipping, 
Summer jam stopper, Tim truck wearing,
Pineapple rocker, then I spray choppers, 
A doctor in the jungles of Haiti made me, 
Draped in paisley bandannas,
Suits with Adam Stacey,
Cigar like Dick Tracy,
Its dark I get spacey,
Alcohol and laced weed,
That was part of my 80's,
The Cartier consigieres be near me,
Canary yellow cuts in my pinky yearly,
Liz Taylor tried to joke me
Cause I keep it green like the other side of bill hicks be
When he gets mean, 
Think fast before I blast hoes,
Like Grassino, 
Went from scraggly old clothes to the illest fashion, 
And realest rappin',
Pablo bath on the scene, won't go back to no green,
Strictly paper cruising through the strip in Vegas, 
Two of New York's biggest niggaz,
Y'all used to hate us, but now you love us, 
Nas and Diddy, power hustlers.

The Afro-American dream is too evident
The potential to be the first black President

Dim the lights to a purple haze then answer the phone
(Hello?) Peep the moon through my retractable dome
What they thought they assassinated was only a clone
We about to venture off into the unknown (let's go)
Where sun rays hook off layers of ozone
Chips inserted in the brain, the new cell phone

You can picture like a photograph, envision the image
Of one-two-fifth street and Lenox
The old folks their souls are cold like tenants
Tryin' to keep your weight up better eat that spinach
For four twenty-five niggas lives get diminished
The world serious, I'm tryin' to win a pennant
Cops be on patrol through the block every minute
Itchin' just to pop somethin', swearin' I'm a menace
They disturb me but it's love like tennis
Man, cap to the side and my jersey is vintage
Chicks'll make a nigga dick hard like a Guinness
Damn it's a scam but I handle my business

Pop shit like needles through ? balloons

About my splurges, merges with Warner Brothers
Thugs actin' funny cause chicks call me honey
See a 9 figure nigga makin' Bugs Bunny money
Eons beyond bling bling
So I chose to get engaged to these sweet 16's
Make a name, let it bang so beautiful

Or, suitable for, a recruit-able whore
To service the whole crew when we out on tour
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

It's like the music will literally stop time

We roll up, 20 deep, cock D swoll up
Get inflicted by my verbal conviction
A Bad Boy but far from a Detroit Piston
You're not focused enough, you're not listenin'
You need to slow down, hold up like kickstand
Hop to it, get on your grind music
Across 110th sharp Caesar with a lime music
Fine-tuned with the proper soul seasoning
Your live shows are boring you're just not pleasin' 'em
Stop teasin' 'em you can't rock Palladium
We bring New York back like that West side stadium
Fuck the game and if the fame went away
Still be the hardest workin' man in entertainment today
Learn a lesson and that's, no questionin' that
No guesswork involved so stop stressin' the facts

Girl, maybe we should think about it
Boo, you know what? What?

The day when I first seen you
You know I was stammed but I didn't mean to
Back then it wasn't oh, so fair
You came through like some good clean air

Skin softer than the softest fabrics

We had a dream, we pursued it
'Member that conversation, all or nothin' before we lose it?

Came at a time I needed soothin', soul, body and mind

Now I know I done put you through a lot of s***
I know it's hard f***in' with a n**** like me
Yeah, you get a lot of respect for that s***
Ridin' with a n****, you know, you might as well

Now sit back and reflect on all our accomplishments
The mansions, the plush apartments
And the big boats and the cases of whole klicko

When got it right, then you know what's what

Can you feel me?
Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Oh yeah
On the dance floor
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's play a game
On the dance floor
(Oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Let's play a game
Let's pretend for a second
You don't know who I am, or what I do
Let's just put it to the side
I can feel your heart beating
I can hear you breathing
Look into your eyes
Trying to see into your mind
See into your soul
See, no limits to the levels
Me and you can go
When it's me, I take control
But it's something about you
That makes me wanna change
I like the way you dancing
And the way you play the game
I like the way you take away the pain
The way you tell me that you want it
Not saying a thing
The way you got me going
Got me going outta my brain
I see us going at it
Going in and out of them lanes

I don't want your innocence
I don't want you to stutter
I don't want a commitment
And I don't want you to suffer
I don't want your number
Baby, I want you to wonder
I want you to come up
Looking like something you wanna

[Christina Aguilera:]
Tell me, what you thinking about
When you got me waiting patiently
And usually, I don't have to wait for nobody
But there's something about you
That really got me feeling weak
When I'm trying to find the words to speak

Boy, I got my eyes on you
Tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning
I don't even know your name
Boy, I need to know your name
I'm hoping that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it

I know you're gonna like it (I know)
So tell me how you want it (Tell me)
And you don't have to fight it (You don't)
'Cause, baby, you're invited (Baby)
I know you're gonna like it (I know)
So tell me how you want it (Tell me)

[Diddy:]
You're dreams fulfilled
You're rockin' with the best
Unforgivable, I'm a put your limits to the test
You're pulsating; your heart is beating outta your chest
You're hyperventilating, trying to catch your breath
(Don't stop)
I'm the first, I'm the next, I'm the end
I'm the boss in your thoughts that'll make your mind bend
Look how I approach you, look how I expose you
Look how I then studied every move, now I know you
I don't wanna control you, I wanna console you
And do everything that I told you
Get high with me, come touch the sky with me
Fly with me, see life in new eyes with me
(Don't stop)
I'm the dream, I'm the one, I'm the reason you come
I'm a king, I'm a hung, I'm a beast
I'm the last thing your eyes see
The passion's inside me - it's yours
Now come try me, c'mon

[Christina Aguilera:]
Tell me, what you thinking about
When your hands is all on me
'Cause I've been thinking about
All the possibilities
Ain't no other place that I really wanna be
'Cause you're sweepin' me off my feet

Boy, I got my eyes on you
Tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning
I don't even know your name
Boy, I need to know your name
I'm hoping that you feel the same

So tell me how you want it (Tell me)

P. Diddy,"I need y'all to hear me out there
Can y'all hear me out there? Uhh

Through blocks and boroughs, cops is plottin'
Snakes slither while hustlers chop they product
Foreign cars exotic, got hoes hypnotic
While I cruise through the concrete, blowin' my chronic
And I move like a diplomat, hoodie and fitted caps
Dwell in the habitat where cons and killers at
Faced a thousand deaths, cowards'll bow to the feet
Of the almighty, a God to the black child
I told moms I would be somethin'
I gave myself to the world now it's like you owe me somethin'
Listen up, I got a story to tell
It's like I fell out of heaven just to walk through hell
It's what, fueled my fire, ignited my desire
You gave me the bricks and the sand to build the empire
Throw the seal on my forehead, my faith still strong
With all I've been through, you would think my faith gone
But nope, I hold my stance in stone
I move mountains with my will and succeed that's how I keep goin'
Won't stop been the motto, feelin' rich like I won the lotto
It's almost like seein' through the eyes of a crack child
Dodgin' crisis, three strike system niggaz trapped in a vice grip
You can't defeat me, I defy all odds and sabotages
I survived Reagan, I survived the first Bush
Thinkin' back when my moms gave that first push
Thank God for my life I came through the room
Until the evil of part two, when God gave me a sequel
Rags to royal, momma hand her hands in soil
Pops moved drugs in capsules and foils
I foiled your plans and made you aware
And turned America's dream into a nightmare
Yeah, you feel the vibe muh'fuckers
The first B.I., ""Ready to Die"" muh'fuckers
So ""Who Shot Ya,"" nine to five muh'fuckers
""Bad Boy for Life,"" is I muh'fuckers
And it's back, better than it ever was
I'm talkin like we was gone but we never was
So I deliver the truth uncut
We produce more hits got the booth fucked up
On top of the statue yellin ""Who want what?""
For the past ten years, the future is us
(C'mon man) Eyes closed like I'm blowin reefer
The preview is over, now enjoy the future
Niggaz

I wanna thank y'all for believin' in me for so long
Thank y'all for ridin with a nigga
As we continue on!
You are now listenin' to the sounds
Of the world famous, you know my name

Take a good look at me
I done cried from the lies
It hurts so bad inside
If you need a thing ain't never had nothing to me 
break me down to the floor til I hide the pain 
And to show you your girlfriend 
What you had me thinking you word was your bond 
(don't you know)
That your never gonna love if you knew it was a situation 
you knew you weren't ready for
I could see if your feelings had changed but damn you just slammed the door
You told me the one you said you would put down your whole life for 
I can comprehend 

How can you turn on me
(how can you how can you)
How can you purposely
(how can you how can you)

Lessened learned house can burn were close to heat
Betcha words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said thought you said that you need me
Thought you said thought you said you complete me
Thought you said thought you said you were never gonna let it go
Thought you said thought you said wen you held me
Thought you said thought you said when'd you tell me
Thought you said thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said thought you said that your never gonna let it go

The times that you weren't there
The times that you left me here 
The times that I needed you 
You know my love is true
My passions inside for you
The nights that I cried for you 
A man has these feelings too
Same shit that chall go through 
I been here before 
Sometimes the pain you ignore
Until its right at your door 
And then you just can't no more
Why does love feel this way
Why does it hurt so bad

Can't even look me in the face
Why does love hurt this way

How can you turn on me 
(how can you how can you)
How can you purposely
(how can you how can you)

Lessened learned house can burn were close to heart
Betcha words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said, thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said thought you said that you need me
Thought you said thought you said you complete me
Thought you said thought you said you were never gonna let it go
Thought you said thought you said when you held me
Thought you said thought you said when'd you tell me
Thought you said thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said thought you said that you never gonna let it go

The heartache and pain 
Sometimes it goes to your brain 
Sometimes it makes you insane 
Sometimes our joy is our pain
'cause it tears you apart these affairs of the heart
I think I'm strong but I'm not
And when I look in ya eyes you know it kills me inside
But I can't wait for that day that you come back to me girl
After we both go away its just to see if its real
There's no denying the fact its meant to be
If you let it go and then they come back.
If this is our last dance we need to practice our steps,
The situation I left behind but your hearts what I kept, 
You said I did you wrong you did me wrong we was both at fault 
And of course you lost me with your alibis and all of your talking 
And most important I just question my self

The pain is taking over I can't believe
(I need your hand)
What happened then compared to now is dreams
(I need your hand)
And I know now that you'll, me

I can't sleep, I can't breathe, I ain't eat in days, stomach pains from arguing
Didn't you cheat on me that's how the problems started 
And as far as I'm concerned we learned our lesson
Well its all in the healing and that process has got me stressin'
I'm so pressured I'm so physically drained 
I ain't thinkin' straight I loved you more than my own self
Although I couldn't bear the pain of seein' my old self 
Young wild uncontrolled self
I love you girl I don't need no one else

Lessened learned house can burn were close to heart
Betcha words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said, thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said, thought you said that you need me
Thought you said, thought you said complete me
Thought you said, thought you said you were never gonna let it go
Thought you said, thought you said when you held me
Thought you said, thought you said when'd you tell me
Thought you said, thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said, thought you said that you never gonna let it go

When I look in your eyes you know it kills me inside

Didn't you, didn't you, didn't you, didn't you, ooh ooh 

Lesson learned
House can burn 
We close to heat
Bet your words don't mean nothing to me

These affairs of the heart I think I'm strong but I'm not

Thought you said thought you said that you love me
Thought you said thought you said that you need me

Come back to me girl

There's no nigga like you and there'll never be another nigga like you
Put your foot on these motherfuckers necks
Do it to 'em daddy, do it to 'em

As my, Daytons spin lowrider sittin' low
Hittin corners so hard you can taste my rims
Hard top six-four, I'm Diddy no tint
I can't hide in New York City
I'm 'bout it in the South, sleep good in the West
Know a chick from Watts with Bad Boy tatted on her breast
I done been there and did it (I done been there and did it)
Ten years without gettin' sweat inside my Yankee fitted
1990-Raw I showed you ice
You ain't know who Jacob was so I showed you twice
When it was (All About the Benjamins) I had two bezels on my arm
Like a Don's supposed to, Sean
Ride with a chauffeur in Gucci loafers
And switch to All Stars without losin focus
These rap niggaz hopeless (hopeless) you can change the locks
But I'm a shine for niggaz that ain't know Big

[Chorus]
Do, seem, like, my, fu-ture's, here, now
It feels good to see the sun in the mornin'
I'm tired of feelin' that the people are talkin'
I heard a rumor that things ain't changin'
But Lord knows that we goin' make it

It's been so long
It's been so real
So magnificent, thank you

Tell me who shot Big (who shot Big)
And take the bullets out of 2Pac's ribs (take 'em out)
If I could I would reverse the car, reverse the beef
Put it all in a pot and boil it on a D. Dot beat (hit me baby)
Sometimes I get drunk, for stress relief
Other times I put ""Life After Death"" on and peep
We ride (we ride) what's a four door Bentley Coupe
Without my nigga on the passenger side?
And still I try (I try) to get money stay fly
Finish the race, holdin' my crown high (take that)
I fly next to God, my eyes on the prize
Been away a long time but now I'm re-energized
(AS WE PROCEED) The life and times of a mastermind (c'mon)
Dedicate every breath to claim my designs (it's mine)
And the day I die, let a G4 fly
And dump my ashes over N.Y.

[Chorus]

Y'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin' name
I told you I was gon' be great ma
I told you I was goin' be somebody!
Oh!! Feel so good
Feel so free
Put your fists in the air, aow!

I'm the King of all Kings, I abide by no rules
And do what I do by any means (c'mon)
Call him necessary, the great visionary
Born extraordinary, a life legendary
Who else put flows out, that put clothes out
Flee the cold weather, short sleeves with my toes out
Nine-six Big showed me what to do
But deep in my heart, this is ""No Way Out II"" (let's rock)
I spend absurd money, private bird money
That Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Bloomberg money (you know what it is)
Old habits die hard, the Vanguard award winner
New York torch gripper, O.G. of the floss nigga
I'm seein' visions like I did a bag of angel dust
This is life when you black rich and dangerous
I'm with God, I'm a live on forever
Bad Boy for life bitch, nobody does it better (nobody)

Y'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin' name
I'm in the best shape of my life!
Y'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin' name
Yeah! You created this monster!
It's so inspirational, it's so real
Bad boy bitch!

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Now
This song is dedicated to the one wit the suit
Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue
So called beef wit you know who
Fuck it he just let him kill all of our troops
Look at the bullshit we been through
Had the niggas sitting on top they roofs
Hurricane Katrina, we should've called it Hurricane (Georgia) Bush
Then they telling y'all lies on the news
The white people smiling like everything cool
But I know people that died in that pool
I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really going on
Make it look like a lot of stealing going on
Boy them cops is killers in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat
Man fuck the police and president (Georgia) Bush
So what happened to the levees, why wasn't they steady
Why wasn't they able to control this?
I know some fok' that live by the levee
That keep on telling me they heard the explosions
Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy
1965, I ain't too young to know this
That was President Johnson but now

Everybody crying but (Georgia)

Now
I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map
New Orleans baby, now the white house hating, trying to wash away like we not on the map
Wait, have you heard the latest, they saying you gotta have paper if you trying to come back
Niggas thinking it's a wrap, see we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Georgia)
Now it's them dead bodies, them lost houses, the mayor say don't worry 'bout it
And the children have been scarred, no one's here to care 'bout 'em
And fash out, to all the rappers that helped out
Yea we like it they calling y'all, but fuck president (Georgia) Bush
We see them Confederate flags, you know what it is
A white cracker motherfucker that probably voted for him
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollars, but he do drop bombs
R.I.P. Tay cause he died in the storm, fuck president (Georgia) Bush
See us in ya city man, give us a pound
Cause if a nigga still moving then he holding it down

Nine hundred to a grand, get you twenty eight grams
If you talking 'bout bricks, I'm the interstate man
And the women say damn, them niggas don't say a damn thing
Boy I bet that shotty make you bounce like a bed-spring
Walking a thin line, gotta defend mine
And wit no pen I'm sorta like a bomb BOOM
Young toon, yea that's what my people call me
Fifty thousand for the cross, trying to keep the reaper off me
I drink a lot of syrup, bitches say I'm sleep walking
Big money for the grill, so I'm never cheap talking, yea
Keep talking and the flame leap off the hip
And keep sparking, pap pap sleep softly
Yea, nap nap, nap sack, three forties
Like fuck another nigga, nigga just don't be the target
Young New Orleans nigga, nigga just don't be retarded
We done lost everything and you looking like a bargain
Purple weed, purple drink, purple heart sergeant
I'm the best rapper in the game no arguing (arguing)

And I don't even write, pause
Un-pause this, so keep ya bitch ass lines inside the margin

They usually want a baller and the young nigga balling
Mike Jordan, pardon my swaggy
Even my father rich as fuck and all my brothers left the family
We said fuck it bought two houses in Miami
I can't wait to do cribs, MTV c'mon get at me

Half four hundred for a feature, wanna battle, I'll beat ya

My dukes, my jeter, she the reason, she the reason
Everybody woman wanna beat a boy diva, not even
There's a 305 dime I wanted ever since I seen her
Got a topic of this evening, hotter than a tub steaming
Gotcha girlfriend dreaming of one day being Trina
Notta sip seemer, ten ki's in the Beamer
Got a white girl driving, couldn't do it much cleaner
I'm fly in the sky like that motherfucking ribbon
Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still living
Spend a condo and a club, one bottle won't do
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks
And bring me that Patrone, I don't play
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days
Behave, no ho, I'm on that Rage Rov
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove
Sorry mami I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed
Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hos
Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hos
Price sizing for a show and the flow
So either Drama is my nigga, or that boy got doe
Go figure that's my nigga, that's my nigga, my nerve

And the way I feel (way I feel)
I wanna curl up like a child (child, child)

I know you can hear me
I know you can feel me
I can't live without you
God, please make me better
I wish I wasn't the way I am

If I told you once, I told you twice
You can see it in my eyes
I'm all cried out with nothing to say
You're everything I wanted to be
If you could only see your heart belongs to me
I love you so much
I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free
Forever yours I'll be

And the way I feel
I wanna curl up like a child

Tell me what words to say
To make you come back, and break me like that
And if it matters, I'd rather stay home
With you I'm never alone
Don't wanna wait 'til you're gone

Just don't leave me

This goes out to my nigga B.I.G.
Listen to me playboy, check dis out
I go, on and on and on and
Won't take her to the crib unless she's bonin'
PD call her on the phone and
Promise I'll leave her moanin'
Now she zonin'
Tellin' me she's all alone and
Love the dark chocolate tone and
Ahead of my time, I live what's said in my rhymes
The cars and the chedda is mine
We ain't, the type to sit back and lose focus
Spit that mack-a-docious
Most ferocious
Cash all in my holsters
Burn more bread than toasters
You must know this, the cats 'm with is the coldest
Hip-hop quota but quote this
Back on the track again, that's what's happenin'
Please believe it, we on top and won't leave it

Sometimes I feel like I'm lonely
And sometimes I feel like I'm lonely

Hey yo see-I-O-F-F-I-E
Q-you-double E-N-Z
Come on ma your riding with me
Leave the lame respect the game
When you hanging on my arm you expect the same
And, ecstasy when you sex the Kain
I, only link with the wealthiest
And only cop jewels if it drop Celsius
Now, you can run but you can never hide
But, where you go when the temperature rise
It's Bad Boy see death in ya eyes
Kain Cioffe the next on the rise
Damagin' shit hot stamina split
You got screwball raps we the hammerin' clique
Limo, the club, and the cameras'll flip
Money, music women son we standin' in it HA!

Yo, yo, yo, yo
Don't panic, don't take this for granted
I did then still do and always ran it
A lot to gain when I say I'm off the chain
The shit I spit, burn flames
Who's controllin' this
I can make the bitches grin
Cause I get money and run with the richest men
Knockin' at ya door it's Curry again
Been down since the jump off begin
You know who I am
Don't get it all twisted up
Get the cash to my hands be all blistered up
We can pick it up, we can drop it low
Recognize what it is when I come through the door
Not partyin' and pimpin', I walk wit a limp
Once I took it to the top I ain't fell off since
Stay high stay fly stay cool in the fan
Ain't none of yall seein' ya man
Get a grip niggas

I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming

I'm back where I belong,
Yeah I never felt so strong
(I'm back baby)
I feel like there's nothing that I can't try
And if you with me put your hands high
(Put your hands high)

If you ever lost a light before,
This ones for you
And you, the dreams are for you

I hear ""The Tears of a Clown""
I hate that song
I always feel like they talking to me when it comes on
Another day another Dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math I'm gone
What am I 'posed to do when the club lights come on
It's easy to be Puff, but its harder to be Sean
What if the twins ask me why I ain't marry their mom (why, damn!)
How do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown
Shit! But I ain't finished growing
Another night the inevitable prolongs
Another day another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Taneisha I'll be back in the morn'
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place I belong

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home

I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming, home

""A House is Not A Home"", I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones are gone (no)
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'
Baby we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love
But we've been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your own
Pick up your phone, come on

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain from yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming, home

""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"", I love that song
Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
'Til we back cruising through Harlem, these old blocks
Is what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away than embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you big)
And here I stand, a better man! (a better man)
Thank you Lord (Thank you Lord)
Thank you all!

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain from yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes

Hey , back on the scene
Ain't nuthin' changed
Still doin' wild things
Whippin' something mean
The whole shorts in the Rolls Royce is off
For sure, bouncin' the bar on my next world tour
When we hit the sick, I'm the cure
We 'bout to pop it off so wild, hit the floor
Ain't nobody botherin' you
All I'm thinkin' 'bout is clobberin' you
Immigration always sayin' I'm harboring a few
Illegal aliens
Females, mostly Latins and Israeli-ans
The top story, evening news
I'm the shit, they been deceiving you
Drop the roof on the Coupe D'Ville
Shoot to kill
Ask niggas, Duke is real
Stay lookin' for the loot to steal
He determined
Don't try to touch Bad Boy, cause we burnin'
I want my glory
Duke is not a joke, and I ain't gotta story
Every time I grab the mic it's with the sole intent
To rip shots and give you 2OO percent
Man, I'm tired of doin' dirt
Tired of being on the the run from Wyatt Earp
Rather be somewhere in a quiet church, sayin' prayers
Not only sayin' mine, but sayin' theirs
That's cause my dogs ain't there

Watchin' DVDs on 5O inch screens
So cut it out, you ain't now Don Juan, please
I stay spillin' Dom on my Sean John jeans
I hit the bar, yo, it's all on me
Pop bottles, models, be all on me
You all goin' see how it's all gon' be
Front on me and see where you all gon' be

See man, hold on, I need to break it down
Yeah
One time like this

Now would you clap your hands
Your hands you clap
If your girl's outta place then your girl get tapped
Niggas keep thinkin' Diddy ain't on it like that
But you never see me standing on the corner like that
Cause, I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
Forget get the cash, the money ain't nothin'
Cause everything I talk about, you know I ain't fronting
I rock Sean John everyday
Boutiques from France to the USA
And I make all the chips off the hits I invent
So it really doesn't matter how much I spent
Cause, I'm droppin' hits
Daily
You burn me?
Really?

You could hop in when your man ain't watchin'
Give you one option, temperature's droppin'
Gettin' cold, control your soul when I'm locked in
You the type of chick that fold when you boxed in
Signals my watch and givin' you more reasons to hop in
This is a Bentley, not a Datsun
Don't confuse me with dude, I'm not him
Your man got a lot to learn
But you could leave with the cat if you that concerned
One day you goin' actually learn

For me to be bouswar

So Branson pass me a jar
Cause these cats done went too far
One phone call send two cars
And still get searched by security guards

This is for the niggas who ain't got shit to love
I cripple thugs, just because
You not Jada but you could, kiss the slugs
Until your place hit up
Rap niggas in the studio, wasting bucks
You're better off making sure papi know your name well
Guess who ghostwrite for me, my brain sails/sells
Now believe it, better place checks
Bad Boy, big things nigga, HF

I put it down for mine, my crew live a life of crime
Constantly non-stop, when they on the climb
And BK, no such thing, it's dark
The sun go down, the tool start to spark
Outline in chalk, moms lift the part
Cases handle in the street, motherfuck the court
Shouldn't talk the talk, you can't walk the walk
It's The Hoodfellaz, what the fuck y'all thought?

Now if you want this money baby
Then I guess you in the right place
And if your mind ain't right sugar
Then you need to get up outta my face
So what's the deal?
Cant' ya see how a nigga feel?
And let me know if you gon' ride tonight
Cause this paper we makin' is real, all day

It's like that y'all (that y'all)
Don't get it twisted with the rap y'all (rap y'all)
Still walk around with the gat y'all (gat y'all)
Don't make me have to point it at y'all (at y'all)
And clap y'all (clap y'all)

Aiyyo, let's get it where it needs to be
Tuned in to the, P-the-D, please believe

The only bars I ever be behind is the one's I co-write
Hold it down, hold the crown

Man I won't stop like a New York taxicab

We get money, hold money, no quotas
We gon' fuck around and do this murder, no motive
Aiyyo, I burn more
Wait till I drop it, then you can learn more (Why?)
Cause you a turn-off

Numb in my veins
And bought enough to numbin' the brain
Lovin' the brain, let a slob till it's come and arrange
Strollin' the block, honey holdin' the glock
1-9, come on baby, it's crunch time
In a truck blue, yellin' my fuck you's
Doin' a buck-2, circle hoods like Doug Ghouls
Huggin' the piece, ha ha, Sim is the word on the street
Come on, I can make dessert outta beef

Attack like a vulture, see what I told ya?
Said I'd get'cha, wear it if it fit ya
Y'all thirteen inches, I see the big picture
If it's to get richer, I'd probably get wit ya
If not burn it, get hot like a furnace
Shoot the video, motherfuck city permits
We own the city, on the phone with Diddy (*phone sounds*)
Red bone pretty, when she get aroused
like to suck her own titty; put it in the video

Once I throw the hook in proceed to get cookin

Since you came thought I owed you one
Wide big Lincoln, why's this guy on the side for the stinking?
Watch task force dash forward lookin marveled
It's a big chance, big pants, might guard him
with my man's type proper
Better learn quick, cause my clique don't argue
You ain't my crew, who are you? Beat it

If my pimping was a drink it'd be a can of Thunder

Bout the size of the hats in the back of my Porsche and
So you better use caution, knowing I'm the boss and
I'm sitting on pyramids, flossing
I don't really gotta talk son
I can get lost and sit back living off endorsements
I'm a pro, kid
Why you acting like you don't really know, kid?
Any records I broke it
Through the fame and the stardom, making my mark on Harlem like Poe did
I said, here's your eviction notice
But you probably already know this
I don't mean to be greedy, but turn on your TV
or pick up your CD, P.D.

Have your momma crying like that
Besides all that, I'm in to get it frying like that
Still on the block and move pies like that
Never my life dealt with guys that rap
In fact, I leave a nigga with his eyes all sad
Swoll up, why y'all niggas better hold up
Any nigga that roll up, could get fold up
Body get ripped up, and then sewed up
Every nigga I fucked with, niggas is growed up
We don't play games, get on the stand, and say names
All we do is cock back, and spray planes
Give a fuck if nigga hustle or gangbang

Predicate assassin, smashin
Open shit, rig scope, focus it
Give niggaz what they 'posed to get (shit)
Oppose the clique, I send five close to six

That's a purpose
One of these faces, make'em nervous
Catch'em when they out for hamburgers
Turn they whole lunch into a murder
In a way all the rounds gon' be heard of

Downstairs with a bag of money and two clips
Talkin' to Loons chicks wit' sombreros and toothpicks
Sayin' they commit homicides for two bits
And fuck for dough like I give two shits
Wildfire call from Hong Kong
Hello (Loon: Yo Kain I just spotted Sean Jean)
Hold up, some information was missing
I just got the same page from Bris
He told me he saw Sean and two chicks followed by four whips
Somewhere in the Florida sticks
It's a set up
Tell the crew to keep their heads high
I'm gonna flip if any one of my mens die
We've been fucked somebody told us a bent-lie/Bentley (what?)
Let's get back to the spot in NY
Seven glocks P-S-P-O pops
Hit both the hot locks

Deep down south I used to try to stack my fuckin' ends 
Hangin' on the set tryin' to stack some fuckin' dividends 
Till a nigga hooked me up with dat nigga Master P 
Flew me 2 tickets now I'm chillin' down in Cali 
Don't' have no money like Snoop Dog or Dr. Dre 
But I'm glad so say I think dat I'm on my way 
Dey say dis click has No motherfuckin' Limits 
Fuck with a nigga have yo guts hangin out like spinach 
Deep down south a nigga strugglin' tryin to survive 
If you down with me yes I'm down for a hoo ride 
Never down with bloods or no motherfuckin' crips 
But if you set trip I'll be down to bust yo lip 
Skip down the yellow brick road to the N.O. 
Deep down south motherfuckin' yeah you know how it goes 
Now I'm a down south hustler quick to make a buck don't give a fuck 
Leavin niggas stuck on the real nigga I ain't stuttin' 
Ain't hard to see where I'm commin' from 
'Cause if you from the streets you got to get the job done 
Commin' up in dem streets ain't no easy task 
Only a nigga with nuts nigga with guts got to get past 
Nigga need skills just to play up in dis game 
For the fortune and fame nigga tryin to make a name 
So peace to the real niggas and fuck all dem bustas 
And dis goes out to them motherfuckin' niggas dats down south hustlin' 

[Chorus] 

Tryin' to make dem ends strugglin' on the grind 
Got to feed the family chased by the one- time 
But dem laws couldn't mace me 
It take a hundred million motherfuckin' po po's to chase P 
Where should I go where should I go 
I know dis eight rap fuckin I hid the dope in the liquor store 
Changed my t-shirt fled out the back door 
Two hours later back in the hood slangin' dope 
'Cause its an everyday thang where I hang at 
3rd Ward Calliope projects I thought I name dat 
Where dem hustlers dwell I mean dem killahs roll 
Don't' give a fuck about you or ya life bro 
And the game get deep down south 
Cause every nigga roll through the hood with gold in dey mouth 
Killahs, dope dealers all dem niggas on the set you know for realah 
Gettin' paid transport narcotics from New Orleans to the bay 
Yo G man it's everyday 
Drop top cutlass,caddys with rags, impalas 
Delta 88 gold thangs and zags 
But we don't' flip flop 
We like to pop motherfuckers dat talk shit on the block 
From New Orleans (background Florida) to Texas (Atlanta) 
Fuck all ya'll bustas cause Master P about it a down south hustler

Lost my way while I was fighting the time
A big black cloud, stormy sky
Followed me, oh I was living a lie
So heartless, so selfish, so in darkness
When all your nights are starless
You're running outta hope
But I found the strength inside to see
Found the better part of me
And I'll never let it go

I've come a long, long way
Made a lot of mistakes
But I'm breathin', breathin'

A wonderful dream came to me
I saw Uncle Sammy weeping
For his children from over the sea

They had come to him, friendless and starving
When from tyrants' oppression they fled
But now they abuse and revile him
Till at last in just anger he said

If you don't like your Uncle Sammy
Then go back to your home o'er the sea
To the land from where you came, whatever be its name
But don't be ungrateful to me!

If you don't like the stars in Old Glory
If you don't like the Red, White and Blue
Then don't act like the cur in the story
Don't bite the hand that's feeding you!

You recall the day you landed
How I welcomed you to my shore
When you came here empty handed
And allegiance forever you swore

I gathered you close to my bosom
Of food and of clothes you got both
So, when in trouble, I need you
You will have to remember your oath

If you don't like your Uncle Sammy
Then go back to your home o'er the sea
To the land from where you came, whatever be its name

Whose microphone is this?

This guy over here?
Excuse me, is this you're microphone?

I mean, I've seen a lot of mcs on this microphone
But this is your microphone, right?
""yeah, yeah, it's mine""
I mean, what I really wanted to know is,
Is this really, I mean really, really your microphone?

Aceyalone:
This microphone is mine
Whenever I hold it, I transcend time
This microphone allows me to shine
Bright, with the light
This microphone is my weapon
This microphone is my confidant
This microphone is my magical wand
To make all y'all, all y'all
I mean all y'all respond
Yeeeaahh
This microphone takes me one step beyond
This microphone helped to save my soul
This microphone helped to pave this road
They say ""what do you do? ""
I say ""what do you mean? ""
They say ""what's your profession""
I say ""microphone fiend""
This microphone is the one and only thing
That lets me live, lets me open up and give
This microphone helps me not be broke
This microphone helped to feed my folks
This microphone always keeps me awoke
I tell the truth and I don't tell jokes
Now check it
I tell the truth and I don't tell jokes
Now check it out
This microphone, when it's in my hand
With or without a band, or a mic stand
I command, even if it's static-why and distorted
I still gotta automatically record it
This microphone, connected to the power supply
My thoughts blossom, like flowers in the sky
This microphone...

P.e.a.c.e.:

We fracture microphones
Is that a microphone? a microphone?

Now I know you not gonna sing that song
Why? 'cause ain't nobody gonna understand that, homes
This fool is the most assured ? ? and thongs on
Down car phones, somebody passed out
With the car door opened, assed out
Run up on him, see what he got
A nice box of microphones, microphones
These are the same ones being slung to the clones
Oooh, another busted busta getting broke by the microphone..

P.E.Z.,"Yeah, for all the festival heads, check it out

Alright it's that time of the year you've been waiting for, for months now
Saving up your pay trying to figure all your funds out
It's kinda funny when you think of all the fun
How it's taken this long to shake last year's comedown
Forget the past, as soon as December starts
Grab your parents' credit card and hope that you don't get in last
Yeah, 'cause if you let it pass these days
A week late can mean paying triple when you bpay off ebay (true)
It's hard to figure out what tickets you want, should it be Falls Festival or Pyramid Rock?
Well for me, I really don't care 'cause I don't listen to rock, or hip hop
I just wear earplugs and sit there and watch
If your favourite band's there you'll think you'll never forget
You'll probably get that wasted you won't remember their set
But if you're a festival head then you already know the plan
Go and pack up all your shit 'cause you're going on a trip for those summer days

Summer days
Oh, summer days
Summer days
For those summer days
I love summer days

Man I'm not squishing in the back
I'm telling you, shotgun front
Nah, bullshit man

Now when you finally make it there from driving up with your crew
You better get your mind set on finding something to do
'Cause you'll be stuck there lining up in the queue
Moving bumper-to-bumper until your arse hurts, all to get your car searched
And if your alcohol you're stressing 'cause you need it bad
Stashing bottles of vodka up in your sleeping bags
Maybe get a spare tyre with a heap of cans
It doesn't matter, everybody has their secret plan
Once your crew start picking your spot
Unpacking, realize all the things you forgot, or shit that you lost
Man, I swear I brought my pillows and socks
And dudes too excited already sitting there sloshed
It doesn't take long before you find somebody blazing up
Mate, what are you doing, I said to save the bud for Xavier Rudd
It's always the cheap fuckers who ain't paid enough, yep
But please note that we don't condone taking drugs

Summer days
Oh, summer days
Summer days
I love summer days
I love summer days

Man, how cold is it inside this tent?
I know, it's freezing man, Jesus Christ!

Now as soon as the sun rises you'll be ready to start
At six o'clock standing there outside your tent with a glass
You're in it for the long haul, it doesn't end when it's dark
We all know you've got your friends to make your energy last
And you gotta time it so you peak it while the acts play
Try and jump the fence and start sneaking into back stage
If you get caught by police then try to act straight
Nah, they're not those pills, I need them for my back pain
And dudes are flying, saying to their mates ""I love you man!""
Or on a walk so they can go and call their Mum and Dad (it's Pez)
And then there's people who so desperately just need a friend
They're going up to anybody trying to have a D&M (yeah, my family)
The next stage is you won't even watch the bands live
You're having too much fun talking shit around your campsite
Getting wasted while you bake in the sun
What can I say, yo, it's a fucking good way to get drunk
I love

Summer days, summer days
Oh, summer days, summer days
I love summer days
I love summer days

Hey, what happened to you guys last night?
I didn't even hear the countdown or anything

Now by the last day you're probably thinking summer's the worst
'Cause all that time out in the sun left you covered in burns
And smothered in dirt, the sight of all the dunnies is worse
And all the food shops are gone when you're so hungry it hurts
All you wanna do is sleep but you got packing to do
Then squash up in that car and jump back in a queue
Yeah, I know we all complain about the pain when it ends
But next year we’ll save up and do the same shit again
I love

Summer days, summer days
Oh, summer days, summer days

Feeding in the sand

Stacking up on my friends 
Feel the warmth of Mr. Sun 
And I`m back to the earth again 

On the wings of a butterfly 
I fly over the flowers 
Into the garden of your love 
Where we melt into the colors 

It`s funny how this beautiful garden 
Gives us what we need 
I like the smell of balsa wood 
I like the smell of weed

Barreling down the tracks

For my caboose to pass

Everyone is riding me 
But it never weighs me down

I`m a teardrop rolling down your cheek 
Familiar with your sadness 
It`s enough to make me weep

Right now I`m a boomerang 
Like karma I come back 

Like a guard growing dreams 
Or a farmer with forever corn

P.M. Dawn,"Yeah!

In a quest to become colorless
I exhault my eyes with a most profound trust
Yet they are masters at deception
I wonder why... a black 4 leaf clover
Prince be sends a purple valentine again

How does it feel to be some kind of beautiful? 

Once more my feelings have succeeded in confusing me
But whats most amusing is
I like the way it looks.

Distorted isn't it? 
But its beautiful!
Exceptionally beautiful!
Damn.

How does it feel to be some kind of beautiful? 

I drift along in a sea of compulsion
Whether or not I'm dead
I have no idea
I'm standing on a hill that overlooks a meadow
And I'm thinking

Of absolutely nothing
My current mood must resemble electric blue
Its always tranquil, but
It makes me bleed

Question marks constantly arrest my persona
Ironic how that creates one for me
Whatever is whatever

A phenomenon that consists of life and death
Hi Mr. Experience
How was your trip to the moon
I tear my thoughts with my own sarcastically piercing blade
I love you
Because you make me sick

Distorted isn't it? 
But its beautiful!
Exceptionally beautiful!",The Beautiful,1991
P.M. Dawn,"Pas quand jetais une femme solitaire, jai puieppe.
Oh never mind me man
I'm just rhyming here
Its an old one that no one knows anyways
That's the way it goes
Kisses directions through my mind every time
Guess he likes to collect blue hickies
I dunno
I remain the same
Comatose anyways
Whatever

Ask me that question again
Who am I what am i
Look at my face the eyes don't lie
If I was with a smooth tongue
Used for fun
I'd take a look at myself
And ask myself why I got a thread
A thread that I'm holding on for sandy
My minds taking things that are going on
Close to the soul
And actually steppin' on
These people are doing wrong
The list can go on and on
For ages
Tangled up through mazes
As lost as a meal that's pushed to a panther
I keep my eyes on those who pass by
They look to pm dawn the quest for the answer
Mercy mercy me till I see
The end of the human race is Grand Prix
Mr red knows I pose a threat
Yea I'd like to see him sweat
Dr vibe tends to get hypnotic
Reality thinks the prince be is erotic
The magic wand seems to be misplaced
I can't see it if its covered in lace
The best way to keep your word is not to give it
I don't make promises cause promises die
But those who use hate just wont participate
So that's why I choose to use my eyes
And stay comatose

A positive and negative impression on your brain
Whatever remains whatever stays the same
Results from an inside view or perspective
Other than that persona snaps under strain
But what remains to be seen
Is how you chose to use your time
And still the point blank calculations unclear
Of whether your text can catch these lines
Or toss 'em to the side
So you can't realize
Illusion only lasts until the scene is through
Approachin' this scenario
What would you do
Lose your noodle
Or try some voodoo
Accept defeat then what's the next phase
Rely on the brave
Rely on the copious
The secret of any victory lies
In the organization of the non-obvious
In a comatose

So they tell me a lie
To keep my head straight
But view sets the fronts like an unseen crime
I like to watch a watcher close
And see what they might take
A tick from a tock
A line from a rhyme
A leaf off an elm
A move might yell bold
An unseen realm
Or what that realm holds
Is nothing.. nothing that makes sense
They walk with small talk
And I watch the consequence swell up
And overflow into a large brook
Maybe its the undertow of what the tide took
The put together scenes
Make it all seem clean
A pacified pictures the life-fiend dream
Till its tried by the spies that's when they realize
The rose ain't red and the violets ain't blue
But those that are swift will pin point the trip
And everyone else'll think its de ja vu
Except the comatose",Comatose,1991
P.M. Dawn,"A question mark's on a question mark
And insecurities connect my parts
I thought you are me and I am you
So I talk to myself 'til my face turns blue
Ask me if my feet touch the ground
I drift away and explore the profound
A morph to satisfaction is the trip
It's you isn't it?
Father tell me what you think of me
Please, tell me what you think of me
The pressure and the weight comes in with the tide
I tell you that I love you a thousand times
Someone said a silver course lands my door
Now question marks talk to me even more
I'm tired.. and I wanna come home
But all that pains me is the thought of my own
The thought of you just reeks with divinity
A spark by my heart is the symbol of the trinity
I can understand that the stakes are high
But I'd really like to know what I've done and why
I'm floating in a sea of doubt when it comes to that
It seems as though all of my thoughts are now acrobats
I am you, now that's a thought to renege
But in the thought that stops it seems to get big
I wonder why father why it is what it is
Because I am what I am? What gives?
Alphabet soup brings uncertain T's
A kiss on the cheek is more trouble for me
Is it possible that I might decompose
And reassemble with a spark and a rose
I notice that oblivion follows me around
As ode to forgetful mind is shot down
Eternity is holding a Rubix cube
And everything inside it seems to be nude
I just don't get it sometimes it's weird
It barely shakes but escalates into fear
I'm so distraught that it now makes sense
The perfect pony.. but you'll only get a glimpse
Now someone tried to hit it with a stick of bamboo
I wonder wonder wonder wonder who
I grin as the era of the selfish fades
And I'm looking at the skies through a pair of dark shades
And I'm buggin' I guess cause it makes me feel good
There's so many things that I misunderstood
I guess I'll never know.. it'd probably cut me like a knife
I swore I spent my life trying to be Christ-like
But I love you father so I can't lie
I think I'll still be scared even after I die",Even After I Die,1991
P.M. Dawn,"If I wuz you

So surreal so surreal
So surreal that it can't be real

And they expect me to be okay
They see me in some other light
But who told them that I wasn't alright?
Get with it said the prince to the be
Doncha realize that they can't see
That's cool I'm in a tranquil state
But I can't see why they don't calculate

Since I'm you and you're just so me
I know they've lost themselves instead
I know that destiny's face is red
I can see my rainbow's real sweet
But for that quick quiz I gotta crib sheet
So what's the matter you? why do ya look sad?
Man this world doesn't look so bad
What's the deal with the heal of a shoe
Why's an ankle such a red kangaroo
It all depends on the way I think

There'd be a time where I wouldn't have a clue
But only if I wuz you

If I wuz you

Poor, poor aristocrat
Shaken down by a pussycat
Thought he was a strong believer in the now
He thought he was up so he got shook down
Deja vu, even I myself
That's why educated guesses I think might help
But a flat out reading, I don't see how
And things we gotta deal with right now
Like the fact that my complexion may offend you
Environment's protection may contend you
There's millions in the quest for synthetic dreams
It's now extreme and pullin' at the seams
I don't wait so it don't bother me
But please forgive me if I act rude
Save the bass for another part of me
But only if I wuz you

If I wuz you I think I'd find my way into the stars
If I wuz you I think I'd let me out of my jar

She used to be a pal real close to me
But she tried to hide from me what was in store
Tried to house me but a house has doors
I was insane and the picture was crazy
So the relevance here seems to be a bit hazy
But I tried to explain this in the simplest terms
But she let the cross burn and it was my turn to say,
""The roses are red, and violets are blue,j
and things are gonna stay that way, too""
And I was the nut to believe all of this
I figured life would just hand me bliss
Now I have to worry about certain doom
Or will I be here tomorrow afternoon
Now ask me about the future.

I just chose to laugh at her
And disregard everything she tells me
Believe in her and she's happy and healthy

Or a dream that's tryin' to tell me something
Or will I ever stop thinkin' about it

I wonder what I would find if I met you
Let my eyes caress you
Until I meet the thought of Missess Princess Who?

Often wonder what makes her work
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They're probably alone, solitaire

I can remember when 
I caught up with a pastime intimate friend
She said, ""Bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me""

She was right, though, I can't lie
She's just one of those corners in my mind

Trying to capture at age twenty-one
? beauty's only skin deep
But love likes to sail when I exhale my lungs.
Fine wines, good times
To try to be an angel's pantomime
That's the ticket but a different definition than the soul defines
Does ""X"" mark spot on a single heart
When it's borne the billion's of Cupid's darts?
To try to spread love to the multitude...
But then there's the few that tears things apart.
Moonbeams condition my dreams
To its current shades of purple and green.
I'm convinced that my aura has the same glow,
And this produces my affection toward rainbows.
Wondering why
Why only my eyes embrace you?
As if I was blind, I persist to chase you.
Through my window I'm watching you smile at me.
And I live for the times when you profile for me.
The breeze, the wind
It fluctuates my adrenaline.
See, it's an ode to the fact you've put your colors on.
Now all I've got to do is tell you it's wrong,
And counteract my tears with a grin.
To balance your feelings in a mind that spins
Is to serenade a rainbow,
While riding on the tail of the wind.

Loving you is easy cause your beautiful.
I don't think so. I think that that's a lot of bull.
My heart and soul are completely taken over.
I'm sick from one of those love hangovers.
I watch the comedy called intellect
Which wraps the nooses around our necks.
It seems the unreal is becoming more real.
They've taken me down to strawberry fields.
Leave me at the tip of Orion's nose,
And play me a song that your heart composed.
Why you can blow me away and I can still see blue,
Agape compels me to love you.
Break me down until you see the sun.
I look at you and smile and you ask, ""How come?""
Father, I talk to you for peace of mind.

And rarely wants to pay for what a person does

Without transforming it to daily life
Is a bad condition of contradiction
A rap like that can slap back afterlife

And spots the mask as to where it remains
On the opposite lane of a fortress bridge
Or the thought that lives on the positive plane

Or a dream that's tryin' to tell me something
Or will I ever stop thinkin' about it?

I wonder what I would find if I met you
Let my eyes caress you
Until I meet the thought of Mrs. Princess Who?
Often wonder what makes her work
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They're probably alone, solitaire
I can remember when 
I caught up with a past time intimate friend
She said, ""Bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me""

[Chorus]",So on and So On,1993
P.M. Dawn,"When you run away with someone
To the corners of your mind
Be it time or place or space of love.
I think you know, I think you know
Whatever magnifies you.
My heart won't let it go so,
Whatever the barriers,
Whatever the forces are.
I know that they don't matter,
But they do
And that's why

[Chorus]
I find it so hard for me to tell you
I want you to love me more
I find it so hard for me to tell you
I want you to love me more
I find it so hard for me to tell you
I want you to love me more
I find it so hard for me to tell you
I want you, to love me more

If you could see what I see
When I rest my eyes on you.
Be it people words or anything
I think they know, I think they know
If its you its you and only you
'Cause my emotions run my life.
So, wherever the rainbows go,
Wherever the teardrops are
I bet they feel the love I get from you
And that's why

[Chorus]

It's funny you should say
I dream you all this time
'Cause all the time, I think I do
It's funny you should say
You see the love. I push to your heart
I sure hope its in your nature
To love me more to love me more
To love me more to love me more",To Love Me More,1993
P.M. Dawn,"Holding on is like the ways of the wind,
Holding on is like the ways of the wind

I wore a ring that was taken so hastely,
Thinking naively that it guaranteed my safety
I'm looking at eyes that have stumbled across a shooting star
Saying that's alright, I know the kind of man you are

Holding on is like the ways of the wind,
Holding on is like the ways of the wind

How many things I recall I can't take too far
She's good at collecting
and counting on the things you are
Forever racing the flames she loved to put me through
I was never a good seahorse
But I can practice rides on you
Another world, another space,
another mind insists I'm crying
I once experienced time with you
Now a ll exists through rage and sighing
Simon says I love you
But not as much as you display
Who says its alright
Then Simon says she's yesterday

Holding on is like the ways of the wind
Like holding on a Nova Star
Holding on is like the ways of the wind
The constant search for who you are

Oh, life

Underneath love's theme lies a superficial chain
Whatever seduced the barrier
Thinks everything should stay the same
I'm meeting mind say,
Hi I think I love you
I never used to run from love
But calculate what I've been through.
Whatever love, whatever vibe,
Whenever I'm convinced you're lying
Ask me for my mind and I
Will ask you why your sighs are dying
Introduce the melancholy
I've felt since last I saw you
You say it's alright
But I'm crushed till it decides upon you

Holding on is like the ways of the wind
I only hope you'll understand
Holding on is like the ways of the wind
finding you've no place to stand

Send my deepest sympathy 
To the flowers of December's garden.
What's for sale of you're emotions.
Tell me. Trust can't buy me love.
Well, that's OK
Tell me of your adventures, you know.
I bet I could survive the wind if
Curiosity's killed the snow for real.

Holding on is like the ways of the wind
Like holding on a Nova Star
Holding on is like the ways of the wind
The constant search for who you are
Holding on is like the ways of the wind

Holding on is like the ways of the wind

P.M. Dawn,"Falling leaves and broken hearts.
I believe you are the same.
Have you noticed streaks and blurs.
Interrupting all the pain
Perish the thought of leaving you and living blind.
Ask me if I killed the questions of why the realm has lost it's shine

[Chorus]
So when it's raining cats and dogs.
I won't complain and I won't mind.
When it's raining cats and dogs
I'll understand the reasons why

If I'm looking for you and the pictures start to fade.
Pushing through the clouded hearts.
Still perplexed at what they've made
Reading the words.
That describe my frame of mind.
Pull me through the fears of nowhere.
Leave me waiting for the rhymes
So when it's raining cats and dogs.
I know it won't be no surprise.
When it's raining cats and dogs,
I kinda wonder if I'll cry

[Chorus]",When It's Raining Cats and Dogs,1993
P.M. Dawn,"If and betting on an if, and if that if might have a chance to survive.
It runs in to twelve different ways of existing each with capacity to change its mind.
The vibe says six, so be six, now it has a clone. That is a bit more feminine.
Pondering the paces of what's going down life. And the greeting is, ""Oh its you again.""
Now come the images so many images. The painful colors and the bliss like tries.
I'm taking notes till the end of theatrics, then it stops, ends, dies
Whatever is whatever, it calculates the karma.
And tries to adjust as it inquires whats shaking.
But through no eyes, I could see the entity crying.

[Chorus]
I cry, when midnight sighs, I cry, when midnight sighs.

Let's pretend its true, no, facade. The vibe says seven, do I look surprised? No.
You, you're so disturbing. Anxious tears do these paint my eyes oh.
The mysterious fee no one sees. And no one tries. 
Whenever tangible,
I'll fall out of love. But for now my mind isn't mine
Sporadic advice, never thinks twice,
But exotic thoughts conclude this frenzy. 
Pay no no attention to the scars.
However bright all the men see is precious you. 
Immaculate trues, Patient lies say,
""Prince your flying"", yeah. 
But through no thoughts, I could see this concept crying.

[Chorus x2]

When midnight sighs, 
If about to be me it's. 
So the vibe say five.
I put on hooves horns and an attitude. 
And nonchalantly find I'm alive.. twelve AM
I understand. I find the eight, too late, its gone. 
But I could see this woman crying
""Cussing, crying, and carrying on my God""

[Chorus]",When Midnight Sighs,1993
P.M. Dawn,"Whatever it is I do, I try to think about you.
I have a love for you that nothing hides.
Whatever it is I do, I'm always thinking of you.
I hope you look at me through patient eyes.
I've become amused.
I've become blind.
I've become what I know not breathes.
You seem illiterate to all my emotions.
I stand corrected, how well you read.
You speak the truth, you speak the me.
You fell the love I have yet to find.
I know it's there, I know it's there.
But I let the sandcastles kill my mind.
Pathetic me, I long to be you.
They think I'm close but i stand so fat.
The turbulent one sheds a turbulent tear.
I'm Mr. Love only 'cause they starve.
Oil and water, lust and sympathy.
I'll life and death my way through the sun.
Where originates all the pain that leaves.
My memory a traumatic sponge and sings to you.
Well define my love and attitude.
Open up your mind and it will sing to you.
You can always tell.
But I know remorse so well.
I left reality early due to the lack of love... reason.

Whatever I do, I try to think about you.
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie.
Whatever it is I do, I'm always thinking of you.
I hope you look at me through patient eyes.

The channel, a professional liar.
How I long to contradict those vibes.
Joni help me, I think I'm falling.
It's not the love and I quest the why.
I don't know, If I'm right, I'm right.
But if I'm wrong then show me I'm wrong.
The fear of pity is always awake.
But infinite sympathy completely gone.
It's the windows, the doors, the passageway to the truth.
Oh my god, it echoes the mind.
In total recall as wild as the deuce.
It's so deceiving is the clouded heart.
So superficial is the open wound.
I caress the infinite light.
That even at night. Overshadows the moon and sings to you.
Well, define my love, that lives with you.
Even when I die, it will still sing to you.
You can always tell if remorse has done you well...
The misconstrued my answers due to the
Lack of love...reason.

Whatever I do, I try to think about you.
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie.
Whatever it is I do, I'm always thinking of you.
I hope you look at me through patient eyes.",Looking Through Patient Eyes,1994
P.M. Dawn,"I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me
She showed me her room, isn't it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on the rug, biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said, ""It's time for bed""

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke I was alone, this bird had flown
