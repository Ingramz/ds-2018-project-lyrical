[Verse 1:]
Years and Feelings
Hopes and Wishes
How many of them we share
How many of them we dare
To show, To Grow
Promise not let it go
Now look, what we become
So gone now, And I don't even get it
How a love like ours could fall apart in one minute
I'm sleeping in a happy home
The next minute, I'm walking out an open door...

[Pre-Chorus:]
And I'm driving down the rear way, swerving off
Trying to get myself together, Hoping I don't cry
Wanting to be together
But this feeling getting worse
Oh I never thought I ever feel this hurt

[Chorus:]
Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel
So I'm hoping like hell that it ain't 4real
Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel
Wishing that it ain't but I know that it is
2 days ago I felt like a star
2 hours ago just lost my heart
Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel
It's all I feel, it's all I feel

[Verse 2:]
Now I remember when I first knew ya
And I was all that had on your mind
Did I ever mean anything to ya
Or was I just something you did to pass the time
Cause now you won't hear me out
You ain't even tryin' to work it out
But I ain't going back
And even though I'm scared
I got too much pride
So I'm in my ride...

[Pre-Chorus:]

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
What you gonna do when you miss my love?
I guarantee that you're gonna miss my love
I thought what we had was real
And the pain is all I feel...
What you gonna do when you miss my love?
I guarantee that you're gonna miss my love
I thought what we shared was real
And the pain is all I feel

So I'm Driving...

Ray J,"Yea creep with me( Come On)
Take you on a mission
Yeah, I know its crazy
Let me talk to you about some deep shit

I met your girl
I text your girl
I sexed your girl
And she loved it
We share affection
Special connection
And no matter how you feel
She's gonna do what she will
She said she needs you
She'll never leave you
And you can sleep better now that you know it
And I'm not here to
Take your position
She just needs to be rubbed a little different

[Chorus]
Is that your wife? (huh)
Is that your shawty? (huh)
So thats your wife? (that's my wife)
Well I'm her boyfriend
Is that your wife? (huh)
I that your shawty? (shawty)
So that's your wife?
Well I'm her boyfriend (boyfriend)

I think the problem is
You don't beat it right
Makin' love is cool
Just pull her hair sometimes
She wants to feel like a lover
Not a touch from a brother
She wanna wake up body achin'
Not fall asleep frustrated
She said she loves it home
Its just somethin' sexy 'bout me
Though all the haters so
What you expect from shawty
Remember when you're gone away
That she'll always be safe with me

[Chorus:]

She really loves you
She says it all the time
She really wants to
Be with you until she dies
I'm just a side
Temporary desire
You keep employed
I'll be her boy toy

Ray J,"[Chorus: x 2]
When a good good girl's gone bad
When a good good girl's gone bad she gone forever, gone forever 

You should be there girl
When I was in love, with you
Listen girl, I said
If I'm not here for love
What am I here for
Tell me baby, got me going crazy yeah, I'm like

Ooh, what am I supposed to do, when my heart is soul is still into you
Ooh, what am I supposed to do, when the girl that I once knew started changing

[Chorus: x 2]]

Ooh, if I'm not here for love
What am I here for, you, oh baby, I said
If you didn't think it was love
What did you think it was
Tell me baby, got me going crazy, I'm like

Ooh, what am I supposed to do, when I've giving all my loving to you
Ooh, what am I supposed to do, when the girl that I once knew starts changing

[Chorus: x 2]

Mommy nah, not at all
Pappies never forgiven you
I can only honestly say
I'm getting rid of you

I pity you 
You did it only to yourself
So when you cry
Understand that you neuced yourself

When a girl's gone bad
She's gone forever
Better said by J
I'm understanding that (unknown)

So all the Prada I bought
You can keep that
When I get to the pad
Have your shit out the door

Ray J,"Killa House
Brick City
Style P.
When Funk Doc start takin' the drag
It's like who in the hell left this apron to lad
broken glass
I'm swinging harder then cash is swung
The only kid with a Velcro, fabric thump
Neva! dropin' the blunt
Two for fine rollin'
Eighty nine in the bricks is fifteen and growin'
killa House fan, you know what it mean
It mean your sifa ain't fuckin' wit the lord of the ring
Diggy! I pack your pipe wit nothin' but bomb
It roll on, like the Power Stripe under your arm
Oh Lord, involge
Massive indo, I'm breakin' the dress code
I ain't rockin' kinda-gos
I just came to get high with Styles
Like my, block D with wider vowels
I'm talking about A, E, I, O, U, my skills already have niggas 'prest
Fuck an interview

You can't fuck wit me dawg, point blank period
I get high and  hallucinate
A pound cast six in New York
But its half in Miami
Nigga move your wait
My dimes be one point O's, 20's be two point 2's
Bring a snack and some fruit punch too
And you know I the purple stuff
I'm so high I can piss on a cloud
And make a bird look up
Smokin' haze in the Hummer wile the bird look up
Gettin' high wit the hammer so the bird shook up
I get high like Doc and Meth
And ""Let the Monkeys Out""
So I can ""Bring the Pain"" wile I pop ya chest
It's D block when the basters repin' (D block)
All I need is a lighter and some haze with a master collection
What

[Chorus]

Okay
Who ya know smoke more Earth then Tical
Hit up a weed spot

I Fight my way up out the D-Tox

Pull up your Rebox

Ray J,"Took away my soul
Changing all my clothes
I can feel it

Found out all my codes
Trying to take control
Of my feelings

I guess it's time now
To say good-bye now
Makes me want to cry
But i got to make alright now

All the things 
We've been through
Couldn't figure it out
Thought we told the truth 
But I guess it was all a lie now

I changed my number
Took down all our pictures
Always in the club now
Drinking a lot of liquor

I had to put my engagement ring
On the dresser
Thought I found my girl
But I guess I still haven't met her

I can feel it

I've got somethin' on my chest to get off I need u to listen lord
It got me trippin' lord
I'm even sippin' lord
Can't get it off my mind
Can't even sleep at night
I tried to talk to mama all my friends and my pastor
No one gave any good advice so I'm gettin' at ya
Because I'm so confused I don't know what to do
Like comparin' a Bentley to a Honda can't compare the two

One girl is my wife

So tell me what to do
Cause I don't know which one to choose
I just don't know

I was scared I was fallin' too deep off with my pimpin'
If I kept on playin' Russian roulette with all of these women like
I guess I broke a rule cause I ain't play it cool
But that ain't no excuse cause that's just what I do
Or either that you were tryna teach me a lesson
To appreciate what I got or recognize the blessin'
And so I see it now
And plus I'm bleedin' now for you to show me a sign and help me figure out

I don't wanna be right
I don't wanna be right
I rather live a lonely life.

Everyday I wake up I still think about the past
I would wake-up in the morning with the same clothes on my back
I would take the money that I made and give it to my dad
I was Present on the block but I was absent in the class
Oh so hard for a young brother
I hardly saw my self and barely every saw my mother
I got in trouble every-day because I loved the drama
Didn't understand how my first name had changed to brandy's brother
I grew up 'Insight' of you Everybody Know I was a fool red laces in my tennis shoes
I blow money on my dead homies funerals
The critics say I'm out acting a fool I'm tired of being excused I'm putting out these sex tapes I'm just living my life
Just because I'm making money and my chain so bright I make the night time day cause my wrist so light

But I always spend my time hanging out sawp chilling with this hoe in the Bronx digging her out.
Fucked her in the kitchen, hit it on the couch, I can't forget to mention I put it in her mouth.
And now it's a long ride home I know I was so damn wrong... but dam I had so much fun.
My girl kept calling my phone I'm thinking about what I've done.

[Chorus]
Dam I can't believe I...dam I can't believe I... dam I can't believe I... dam I can't believe I cheated on my woman with a girl from the Bronx

The next day I thought shit was all over but my girlfriend giving me the cold shoulder said she found some empty condom rappers in the rova, now she throwin fits telling me to go,
Crying in the bed room burning all my cloths taking all my shoes and put 'em on the stove all in the kitchen looks like a furnace...
Ten minutes later whole house burning, and now you see me in a robe running out and you can here the police coming without a doubt.
The cops saw us fussing my girl was tripping hard, they locked me up in handcuffs threw me in the car, and now I know that
It's over I called her over and over she won't answer my call's I thought my pimping days were over, I stood up only to fall.

[Chorus]

So put your Porche up, (uh) 
Get your divorce up, (uh) 
I'm sure she'll sign it when she seen me put my doors up

We have come too far to stop or give up
And I know you think it's better to just leave and this is where I disagree
But I know I'm shooting with my words,
Except girl they only words,
You know my actions are louder then what you heard,
I'm tired of this arguing and I wish for one last thing,
It means the world to me.

'Cause I know what we got, even when you don't,
We rock baby 'til the wheels fall off, feel me?
It's real love and I still believe if I wish on one last thing,
Last call, last kiss baby just one last wish,
Last wrong, last slip baby just one last wish.

Been through it all, fought through the pain,
And our love's even stronger girl we can do it again,
And so that's all, and that's it baby just one last wish

Girl I'm sick and tired of deja vu
'Cause here we are again at the top of our lungs,
Till we both know we love harder then we give each other chance to see,
And every time I see tears it hurts,
Tell me is it really worth
You crying me lying it's absurd,
A better man is what I'm a be
So I wish for one last thing,
And that's you and me

'Cause I know what we got, even when you don't,
We rock baby 'til the wheels fall off, feel me?
It's real love and I still believe if I wish on one last thing,
Last call, last kiss baby just one last wish,
Last wrong, last slip baby just one last wish.

Said we have been through it all, fought through the pain,
And our love's even stronger girl we can do it again,
And so that's all, and that's it baby just one last wish.

Damn if I could just wish for one last thing,
Oh baby we've been here before,
Got outta control then we let it go,
It's time that we pick it up and never have to sacrifice,
This a new setup, we can do it better,
Me and you against the world take over together,
Yeah that's how real love should be,
So baby one last call, last kiss, baby just one last wish,
Last wrong, last slip baby just one last wish,

Do you remember the time girl

That blouse on you fit just right
Them jeans she got on skin tight
Shes sexy cool but still shy

We know each other we go together
Like hamburgers and french fries
Everything's all right
We'll never have a fist fight
But last night we had a sex fight
Then told her have blessed night
I'm leaning I'm meanin'
I fall asleep might have dreams in it
Did the club thing, brought my team in it
Last night I bring my queen in it
I go get it you bullshitter's
I hit it, damn right the kid did it

Two bad streets off the main road
You had her but she left so 
That's just the way the game go
No one on my level 
So please get up out on my lane holmes
I met a girl so real no need to bring no game home
Reminisce of Gucci every time they play my same song
I'm on her like a long john 
Short skirt with no thongs on
Sexy naked sunbathing outside my house with frames on
I took her from some busters? 
And that boy ain't gon' shit bout it
Its alright we can tell that sucka to forget about it

Remember back rubs and pink champagne

I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first

I had her head going north and her ass going south
But now baby chose to go West
We deep in the building she know that I kill 'em
I know that I hit it the best
Candles lit with that wine, money still on my mind
And I gave her that really bomb sex
No matter where she goes or who she knows
She still belongs in my bed
Going hard in the streets, mobbin' with my homies
Sippin' on good, blowin' on OG
Me and ghost sittin' clean with the matching rollie
I did that first so everybody know me

Steady on at the top where we finna be
Apple juice and we mix it with the Hennessy
Give her no dough to come, but I gave her 10 to leave
I bet I hit it first, unless you took that girl virginity
First come, first served is all a player know
But I don't wanna be a player no more
That's a lie, I'm way too fly
I love anything with ass that walk by
Yeah you love her, yeah you hug her and you kiss her
She dome me up, she give me face like some whiskers
Tia’s and Tamera’s, I be knockin' sisters
And I still hit, while you lonely and you miss her

When I walk in the function
You already know I'm leaving with something
Girls know when I'm coming
I give a girl real proper loving

And if you were to come back to me girl
We'll make another movie

She might move on to rappers and ballplayers
But we all know I hit it first
I hop in the club and boppers show love, and I don't even put in work
I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first

That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

As the years say good-bye
One by one on silent wings they fly
What will last, what is true

This world will find its way somehow
I've got all that I need right here, right now

When the snow falls from Heaven
On the dreamers below

They're all of your rich friends who you knew in the city
And now they finally brought you home to me
When you left you told me someday you'd be returnin'
In a fancy car for all the town to see
Now everyone is watching you finally got your dream
You're riding in a long black limousine
The papers told of how you lost your life the party and the fatal crash that night
The race upon the highway the curve you didn't see
And now you're in that long black limousine

A chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine

I'm just dying to hear you
Calling my name one more time
Oh so don't pay no mind

Must be something in the air
That I'm breathing

It's just this heart on my sleeve that's a bleeding

You leave me here bereaving from the words so hard and plain
Saying the love that we had

Was just selfish and sad

Is just making me mad

I lost all of my innocence
When I fell in love with you

Where all of my wounds they turn into gold, when I kissed your hair

Now come to me Hannah
Hannah won't you to come on to me
And I'll lay down this bottle of wine
If you just be kind to me

Ask her why she cries so loud
Will not say a word
Eyes like ice and hands that shake
She takes what she deserves 
To celebrate her emptiness 
A cold and lonely room
You sweep the floor with your long flowered dress
If you cannot find a broom

Now come to me Hannah
Hannah won't you to come on to me
And I'll lay down this bottle of wine

Right down to the backs of her knees

And the Lord is hard to please
So she comes down from the Ozark hills to these very streets to roam
With a banjo and a bible and a fine tooth comb

Now come to me Hannah
Hannah won't you come on to me
And I'll lay down this bottle of wine 
You just be kind to me

Now I'd walk one mile on just broken glass
To fall down at your feet
Mmm Hannah you're the queen of the street

I climb the tree with my Hannahlee
My intentions they were pure
Oh the breeze did whip and I lost my grip
And I tumbled towards the earth 
Where you never would guess who it was that stood below
And his name I would never tell 
But His eyes were clear
And His arms were strong
And he caught me as I fell

Now come to me Hannah
Hannah won't you to come on to me
And I'll lay down this bottle of wine

I could hold you in my arms, oh

My worried mind, that you quiet
Place your hands on my face
Close my eyes and say

With no proper side
I could hold you in my arms
I could hold you forever
And I could hold you in my arms
I could hold you forever

And freedom can be an empty cup from which everybody want to drink

Ray LaMontagne,"10. Till the sun turns black

can you see the young and pretty
Confident as cops 
Blooming laughing in the shops
Till the sun turns black
Can you see the old and lonely 
Walking through the park
Pushing grocery carts
Till the sun turns black
Can you see the corporate man
He's winning on the telephone
His possessions are his throne
Till the sun turns black
Can you see him in his lounger
Watching tv in the dark 
Waiting for the spark
Till the sun turns black
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooo ooh wee ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooo ooh wee who are --
Can you see the working classes
Trudging through their days 
Time goes slowly when you're only waiting
Till the sun turns black
Can you see the wise man simply
Living loving quietly
Every breath he takes eternity
Till the sun turns black

To hear what you already know
And all you really had to do was ask
I'd have told you straight away

And all that was false was fact

Now you hold me close and hard
But I was like a statue at most
Refusing to acknowledge you'd been hurt
Now you're clawing at my throat
And you're crying, ""all is lost""

It took every ounce of faith I had to keep on keepin' on
And still I felt like I was only losin'

I refused then like I do now to let anybody tie me down
And I lost a few good friends along the way
I was raised up poor and I wanted more
And maybe I'm a little too proud

Afraid, hungry and old before his time

And those who couldn't choose a path worth taking

Who never knew his life was his for making

Lonely and old before your time

Ray Leonard,"Daddy waited up, in the kitchen by himself
I came stumbling in that night
With liquor on my breath
He said, ""Son I know you live here
But this is still my home
It's my way or the highway""
So I said alright, ""I'm gone""

And before I slammed that door
I said, ""I hate you""

But you can't stop my love for you
It'll be here that's a given
As long as I am living on this earth
One thing is true
You will turn away, forget me
Curse my name but love won't let me let you go
Son always know, my love is unconditional

Life is like a circle
Slowing turning on itself
And girl it took losing you 
To finally know how daddy felt
But we stood in this bedroom
A year ago today
Hangin' on to pride and anger
As we threw our love away

And before you slammed that door
You said, ""I hate you""
But tonight if only you could hear me say

That you can't stop my love for you
It'll be here that's a given

Ray McKinley,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,1965

Ray McKinley Orchestra,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,2001

Well come along with me boys it's just down the road a piece.

Now there's a place you really get your kicks
It's open every night about twelve to six
If you want to hear some boogie then you'll get your fill

You came here from the Middle West and certainly impressed the population hereabouts.

Show her!

Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me!

Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1969

But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be

Don't' blame me!

Don't blame; me.

Frankie was loyal to Johnny
Just as true as the stars above

Frankie went down to the drugstore
Some ice cream she wanted to buy
The soda jerk told her that Johnny
Was making love to Nellie Bligh

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

Now Frankie's dad was a policeman
She stole his old forty-four gun
Then back to the drugstore she beat it
Just as fast as she could run

After her man
Who was doing her wrong

Now Frankie peaked in on the party
She got a surprise when she saw
That Nellie and Johnny were making love
And sipping soda through a straw

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

So Frankie flew into a tantrum
She whipped out that old forty-four
And her rootie-toot-boom, that gal did shoot
Right through that hardwood swinging door

She shot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong

So bring on your crepe and your flowers
Bring on your rubber-tired hack
'Cause there's eight men to go to the graveyard
But only seven are coming back

Quite the best looking doctor in the state,
He looked after my physical condition
And his bedside manner was great!

When I'd gaze up and see him there above me,
Looking less like a doctor than a Turk,
I was tempted to whisper, ""Do you love me,
Or do you merely love your work?""

He said my bronchial tubes were entrancing,
My epiglottis filled him with glee,
He simply loved my larynx
And went wild about my pharynx,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my epidermis was darling
And found my blood as blue as can be,
He went through wild ecstatics
About my lymphatics,
But he never said he loved me.

And though, no doubt, it was not very smart of me,
I get on a-wracking of my soul,
to figure out why he loved every part of me,
And yet not me as a whole.

By my esophagus he was ravished,
Enthusiastic to a degree,
He said 'twas just enormous,
My appendix vermiformis,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my cerebellum was brilliant,
And my cererum far from N G,
I know he thought a lotta
My medulla oblogota,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my maxillaries were marvels,
And found my sternum stunning to see,
He did a double hurdle
When I shook my pelvic girdle,
But he never said he loved me.

He seemed amused,
When he first made a test of me
To further his medical art;
Yet he refused,
When he's fixed up the rest of me,
To cure that ache in my heart.

And for my spleen was keen as can be,

I'd the sweetest diabetes,

Jump out of bed and I head for the grapenuts

Trying to find a clean pair of socks and a shirt
Still sporting the same drawers even though they hurt
In the fridge, there's a Faygo, it tastes ill
'cause it's flatter then a bitch on a big wheel
I got a few money back and a little change
So I'm heading to the store when the phone rings
""What up man, check it out, I know this bitch
She's got another friend with her and her dad's rich
If we find us a ride out to Wyandotte
guaranteed, we can fuck em both on the spot""
Oh shit, let me call Bill Bill
I want to let my nuts through the windmill
He ain't home, fuck, I'll call Mike Clark
'cause I know he can get the fuckin Skylark
He said he can, but he's broke and it needs gas
But I want to buy these Faygo, think fast
I know my brother Jump Steady's got a few bones
But that's going through his shit when he ain't home
""Nevermind J, Legs loned me a ten
No need to get punched in your head again
Tell Mike to scoop me up right away
And it's Faygo and neden hoes all day""

Lock the house, and wait for em in the street
I wish I had a piece of gum or something fuck

I just have to ask them with who and where you've been

I cant turn you loose, though I know its self-abuse
I still cant get over lovin' you

But its just no use, cause I expect them to be like you, baby
I don't know what I'm gonna do

I still cant get over lovin' you

Knowin' you're with someone else (someone else), oh

Cause I want you for myself

And I'm not blamin' you, naw, baby

And even though I wish that you'd still love me
It still wont change the way I feel for you

Ray Pillow,"A story bout a pal of mine who worked down near the Georgia Line
A DJ in a little country station

Everybody loved him dear cause he played what they liked to hear
He built himself a quite a reputation

At record hops he stayed out late and his mom would always wait
To see if he had made it home alive

She warned against his loss of sleep and driving fast in that old heap
And that he had to be at work by five.

BJ the DJ you're living much too fast
And if you don't change your ways don't see how you can last.

Every morning just past four from the driveway he would roar
Overslept and he was late again.

Then at breakneck speed he'd drive to sign the station on at five
He had lots of records he must spin.

His mom said by the radio until his voice told her hello
She knew then that he made it there alright

Then she'd say a little prayer, giving thanks that he was there. And she'd wait up for him again tonight

Then one cold and rainy morn all the tires were badly worn
But still he screeched off just as fast this time.

BJ had a lot of nerve but he completely missed the curve
And he signed off down near the Georgia Line

Mom sat by the radio the voice she heard she didn't know
BJ'd never been this late before

But with the road so bad and all she'd wait a while before she called
And then she heard the knock upon the door

BJ the DJ only twenty four a wreck at ninety miles an hour he'll spin the hits no more. ",B.J. the D.J.,2009

The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
The cabaretes and honky tonks their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights

Lights that say forget her name in a glass of cherry wine
Lights that offer other girls for empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights

The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
The God who put the stars above I don't believe made those lights
Oh it's just a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
Just a place to run away and hide behind those city lights

Lights that say forget her love in a different athmosphere

But she'll find out one morning you reap just what you sowed
The sad part is she'll be alone once she starts to fall
There's no fool like a young fool who thinks she knows it all.
It breaks my heart to see her sitting there
With tavern lights shining in her hair
Life won't be as sweet to her tomorrow as today
There's no fool like a young fool who throws her life away",There's No Fool Like a Young Fool,1962
Ray Price,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

How can I go through life without you like it was before
When I can even make it to the door

Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why cant I free your doubtful mind,and melt your cold cold heart

You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sat and cry
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from lies,to try it just ain't smart
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart

I let you come and go at will it seems
You're back again this time you say forever
But I wonder just how long forever means
How long is forever this time
How long until one night you don't come home again
How long is forever this time how long until I'm all alone again

Ray Price,"Nights are longer when you're blue and all alone
Seems eternity will past before the dawn
I tried everything but I can't seem to lose
All these after affects from loving you

I never criticized the things you do
Now I see what I'm letting myself in for

What I was to know that too much love will always do the same

Ray Price,"Twilight falls, 
Evening shadows find,
There 'neath the stars a maiden so fair divine.

The moon on high seemed to see her there,
In her eyes was a light shining ever so bright,
As she whisper'd a silent pray'r.

Ev'ry word revealed an empty, broken heart;
Broken by fate that holds them so far apart.

Lonely there she kneels, and tells the stars above,
In her arms he belongs, then her pray'r is a song,
Her unending song of love.",Maiden's Prayer,1965

Now I'm so hurt and you're so unconcerned and our love's just another bridge to burn

But don't love me then act like we've never kissed

If they gave gold statuettes for tears and regrets I'd be a legend in my time

Fill up my glass till I reach the point past remembering
Where the music is loud the conversation is free

For she's constantly with me in memory
I go home but I couldn't sleep and after hours I'd be walking the streets remembering

Just out of reach of my two empty arms.

Memories time can not erase
Then I awake and find you gone
I'm so blue and all alone
So far away from lips so sweet and warm
Just out of reach of my two empty arms.

(Spoken)
Ah honey, you know that old lonesome feeling that I have all the time
It's just knowing that I know you'll never be mine
And the dreams that always keeps on hurting in my mind
I know we're only bound that she and I could never be.

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl
And still their heavenly music floats, o'er all the weary world.
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its babel sounds the blessed angels sing

Oh yeah, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
Oh, rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing

When the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their king

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk

Don't ever be too certain or you'll be singing too

If you're young at heart.
For it's hard, you will find, to be narrow of mind

You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams.
And life gets more exciting with each passing day.
And love is either in your heart, or on it's way.

Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth
To be young at heart.
For as rich as you are, it's much better by far

Look at all you'll derive out of being alive!
And here is the best part, you have a head start

Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad so I had one more for desert
Then I fumbled through my closet for my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
Well I'd smoke my brain the night before with cigarettes and songs I'd been picking
But I lit my first and watched the small kid coursin' at a can that he was kicking
Then I crossed the empty street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone frying chicken
And it took me back to something that I'd lost somehow somewhere along the way
On the Sunday morning sidewalk wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing (sure) short of dying half as lonesome as a sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk Sunday morning coming down
In the park I saw a daddy with the laughing little girl that he was swinging
And I stopped beside a Sunday school and listened to the song that they were singing
Then I headed back for home and somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed through the canyons like the disappearing dreams of yesterday
