Jay Hoggard,"Here we are on earth together
It's you and I
God has made us fall in love, it's true
I've really found someone like you 

Will it say the love you feel for me, will it say
That you will be by my side 
To see me through
Until my life is through 

Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world
In love you and I, you and I, you and I 
I am glad at least in my life I found someone 
That may not be here forever to see me through

But I found strength in you
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for, you see
Don't worry what happens to me

Cause in my mind, you will stay here always
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I 
In my mind we can conquer the world 
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I",You and I,1990
Jay Hoggard,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1991
Jay Hoggard,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,1991
Jay Hoggard,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1994
Jay Hoggard,"Ooh

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.
I don't mind the gray skies
'cause they're just clouds passing by.

Heaven is a goodness time. 
A brighter light on high.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe God is now, was then and always will be.
With God's blessing we can make it through eternity.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.",Come Sunday,1999
Jay Hungerford,"Get out of town
Before it's too late, my love
Get out of town
Be good to me, please

Why wish me harm?
Why not retire to a farm
And be contented to charm
The birds off the trees?

Just disappear
I care for you much too much
And when you're near, close to me, dear
We touch too much

The thrill when we meet is so bittersweet
That, darling, it's getting me down
So, on your mark, get set
Get out of town",Get out of Town,2007
Jay Hungerford,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2007

Another man done

Jay Jay,"Ombak lautan berombak
Mengapa mengubah pasir di pantai
Bayu bertiuplah bayu
Mengapa menjadi ribut dan badai

Begitu kita merancangkan
Belum pasti hadirnya kebahagiaan
Fahamlah apa itu takdir
Akan berseri hidup yang ditadbir

Hidup menggadai harta
Agar diri berharga
Janganlah kau salah mengerti
Kelak kau kan menggadai diri

Mencari penghormatan
Janganlah sampai terkorban
Yang mulia pasti kita hormatkan
Yang rendah jangan dihinakan

Tenang di air yang tenang
Jangan di sangka boleh direnang
Kail panjanglah sejengkal
Janganlah lautan hendak diduga

Itulah pesan orang lama
Menjadi bekal pada yang berusaha
Ingatlah pepatah ini
Menjadi panduan hidup berbudi",Senandung Hidup Berbudi,2016

Jay Jay French,"You got your invitation
A family dinner, and tonight you will meet

No need for hesitation, sugar
We're gonna love you and it's all we can eat

The steaks ala carte mama makes from the heart
And my pa's such a gourmet for gore
Jammed eyes, bleeding herbs

Called up your folks, and they'll join us for brunch

Jay Jay Johnson,"There was a boy
A very strange, enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return""

""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return""",Nature Boy,1988
Jay Jay Johnson,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Mode [Take 2],2002

Jay Jay Johnson,"Hide your heart from sight,
Lock your dreams at night,
It could happen to you.

Don't count stars,
Or you might stumble.
Someone drops a sigh,

Run when church bells ring.
It could happen to you.

All I did was wonder how your arms would be,
And it happened to me.

Jay Jay Johnson,"How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last.
How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

It's you or no one for me
I'm sure of this each time we kiss
Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Please don't say no to my plea

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove

Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,2004

That's cryin' for heat
He treats me awful
Each time we meet
It's just unlawful
How that boy can cheat
But I must have that man

He's hot as Hades
A lady's not safe in his arms when she's kissed
But I'm afraid that when he's cooled off
And maybe I'm ruled off his list

Jay Johnson,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time for waiting game

When days dwindle down to a precious few
September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,2009
Jay Kauffman,"I took your note and I folded it up
And I walked right out the door
Even though I had just woken up
It still felt like the night before
I thought the room had started to spin
When you gave me a second glance
I didn't know if you would see me again
But I was ready to take the chance

I've been waiting for you such a long time
I've been waiting for you such a long time

In my dreams I tried to call you up
On a thousand nights before
But every time I did the signal cut
And the phone slipped to the floor
I heard my heart beating in my ears
Louder than the dial tone
I knew that I would try again for years
Until I got you on the phone

I've been waiting for you such a long time
I've been waiting for you such a long time",Waiting [Acoustic Version],2009
Jay Klum,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,2002
Jay Klum,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,2002
Jay Klum,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me

Jay Klum,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is [Take 1],2002
Jay Kool,"Visualizing the realism of life and actuality
Fuck who's ""the baddest""; a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as 5 percenters
But something must of got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some resting in peace and some are sitting in San Quentin
Others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition
Keeping the effervescent street ghetto essence inside us
Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leaving thieving
We'll be leaving with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere else stacking plenty papers
Keeping it real, packing steel, getting high
Cause life's a bitch and then you die

Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff la
Cause you never know when you're gonna go

I woke up early on my born day, I'm 20, it's a blessing
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it
One quarter through life some Godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from
My skull cause it's pain in my brain, vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young, at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbing foreigners, take their wallets, their jewels
And rip their green cards
Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash and
Got my first piece of ass smoking blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of saying ""fuck tomorrow""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is Illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic that crack your whole cabbage

Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high

Jay Leonhard,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end,
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're so close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

A horse is a horse of course of course
And no one can talk to a horse of course.
That is of course unless the horse
Is the famous Mister Ed!

Go right to the source and ask the horse.
He'll give you the answer that you'll endorse
He's always on a steady course.
Talk to Mister Ed!

People yakkity-yak a streak
And waste your time of day,
but Mister Ed will never speak
Unless he has something to say!

A horse is a horse of course of course
And this one'll talk 'til his voice is hoarse.
You've never heard of a talking horse?

about that number, you know? I used to have a gal in my arm, you know...

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing

And call up sin-

You just don't own to it

Well, I'm not a sinner
Don't wish you well
But I won't reward

You're a bully and a cheating man
You could be a healer
And you'll be telling yourself your songs

You can put it out if
You just don't own to it

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams

Jay Pea,"Out on the long docks
With the smell of your red locks
There‚Äôs a feeling I cannot hush
When you told me to stay clear
Of the things that kept you here
Did you think I could learn to stop

Now the days become daunting
Cause I know that I‚Äôm leaving
To step back into the wild
Where the uncharted waters
Reunite long-lost lovers
Or set them off different trails

Hey don‚Äôt deny
Your smile‚Äôs a lie
You‚Äôre not coming alive
Before you try
And seize the one last chance you have of holding her
Against your heart

All your breakup suggestions
To me were out of the question
Cause I thought we were bound by faith
But if faith had a meaning
I‚Äôd meet you in the morning
And make up for all this waste",All Your Denials,
Jay Pea,"Marty thought about his brother
Planting trees in the middle of nowhere
He hoped he‚Äôd come
Back before his grandma died
His brother sent him out a postcard
Saying he was working real hard
He hoped he‚Äôd come
Back before the summer sighed

August came and Marty waved
As his brother returned
They went out straight to their grandma‚Äôs place
To wish her well
She said: ""I might be done soon,
But you gave me back my smile
You can go back outside,
Cause I‚Äôll be here for a while.""",Back in Tuscaloosa,
Jay Pea,"‚ÄúOn with the night‚Äú
She shudders and ponders about her last dream
The one where she let out the scream

The morning was clear
She knew she was near 
The old house she hadn‚Äôt seen
Since she hurried off in the spring

She walks past the gate
She knows she is late
So she runs through the door
Expecting to find her dad waiting inside
But there he is stretched out onto the floor

Oh Dalilah, what words could appease all your aching grief
I looked at the sky and it showed no clues about why you were chosen for
This hardship that bruised your soul

You‚Äôve lost your belief that strong things don‚Äôt brake
And you long for relief from this dream you can‚Äôt shake off
But don‚Äôt lose your faith, you‚Äôre never quite as lonely as you think

You‚Äôve lost your belief that strong things don‚Äôt break
And you long for relief from this dream you can‚Äôt shake off
But don‚Äôt lose your faith, you‚Äôre never quite as lonely as you think",Dalilah's Dream,
Jay Pea,"So round you go
Behind the wheel 
That‚Äôs been keeping you on your heels
You‚Äôve got your backpack and some beer
You‚Äôve got the fire, you‚Äôve got the fear
Of getting lost

Why don‚Äôt you take off and throw away the roadmap that guides your life
The unexpected things are always those that make you ripe
I‚Äôve been to Reno, I‚Äôve been to Spain
But if I leave this morning, I‚Äôll just go where it doesn‚Äôt rain

I‚Äôve found my love and my sorrow is gone
I‚Äôve found my love and my sorrow is gone
I never thought it‚Äôd come
As surely as the sun
I never thought I‚Äôd try
To explain to her how I‚Äôve been missing her all my life

Now that I lie
Against these raucous Atlantic tides
Now that I lie 
Alone without her by my side
Now I just try to explain to her that I‚Äôve been missing her all my life

So round you go
Along the lines
Of this journey you‚Äôve set out in your mind
You‚Äôve got the slippers and the hood
You‚Äôve got the fire, you‚Äôve got the goods
To survive

I‚Äôve found my love and my sorrow is gone
I‚Äôve found my love and my sorrow is gone

I never thought it‚Äôd come
As surely as the sun
I never thought I‚Äôd try
To explain to her how I‚Äôve been missing her all my life

Now that I lie
Against these raucous Atlantic tides
Now that I lie 
Alone without her by my side
Now I just try to explain to her that I‚Äôve been missing her all my life",Happier on the Road,
Jay Pea,"I left her down the road
And rolled away into dismay
I let the end unfold
Before I ever felt betrayed

The marbled skies
Reveal their ties
To imaginative wisdom 
And a cast that plays at random
Well who‚Äôs that girl
With the hypnotic swirl
That sweeps into my nights to cover me with her green eyes and says :

‚ÄúYou are all that I have
And you are all that I need
You are caught in this web
And you are caught in between‚Äú

There‚Äôs a gift under your scar
And a ladder to the stars
If you cut through its design
You will understand the signs
Of the silhouetted trees
Leaning over with their leaves
Barking words of great relief
Like remorses from a thief

The marbled skies
Reveal their ties
To imaginative wisdom 
And a cast that plays at random
Well who‚Äôs that girl
With the hypnotic swirl
That sweeps into my nights to cover me with her green eyes and says :

‚ÄúYou are all that I have
And you are all that I need
You are caught in this web
And you are caught in between‚Äú",Marbled Skies,
Jay Pea,"The river‚Äôs wide
And I‚Äôm taking in the good breeze
To wash away the homesick blues that hounded me
I spent the night with a girl in Buenos Aires
Whose smile was bright and spoke about the lights that had pulled her from the night
Her trip was almost done


I lost the track of time and facts
Until the water got me high enough
To feel the kiss, the singing bliss
Of fleeting love that takes off like a dove

I‚Äôm whistling along the silvery river chant
I think its patterns may be something we‚Äôll never grasp

I lost the track of time and facts
Until the water got me high enough
To feel the kiss, the singing bliss
Of fleeting love that takes off like a dove

Well I can I see the moon
And I can see the day
And I can see the moon
And I can see the day",Silver River,
Jay Pea,"The taxi cab kept speeding on
And you thought you were on your own
A quiet separation
A tender goodbye session

""Is this the last time I kiss you?"",
You whispered in a raspy voice
As time came flying by
Like a butterfly

Oh I won't shed a tear
But if I feel the wave
Pushing through my veins
And if I see you grin
I will weep all night

I threw an apple like a rope 
And tied myself to all her hopes
Desperate solitude
In southernmost latitude

Dieciocho cleared ahead 
As violet trees caressed my head
Like a rolling stone
The movement was my home

Oh I won't shed a tear
But if I feel the wave
Pushing through my veins
And if I see you grin
I will weep all night

I wish a four-leaf clover told me right
And you'd come shining back into my life
I wish a four-leaf clover told me right
And you'd come dancing back into my life

Love will bring you down
Into a realm so lush
Love will bring you down
Into a bleak distrust

I hope hiding out is a slippery slope
I nearly believed that I would be relieved
To stay with you...",Southernmost,
Jay Pea,"Walking down the hill, Carson sees
A signpost showing a man on his knees
He comes up to a girl who says hello
And he smiles and her eyes go kind
‚ÄúAre you also heading for the Tower of Slow ?‚Äú

The night‚Äôs a murmur and the moon is shining bright
Bathing the trail like a guide to destiny‚Äôs path
They feel the joy breezing from within
As the wonder softly spreads out under their skin

From the lonely tower people look out for shining truth
And all the lonely cowards cover their eyes to avoid the view
From the lonely tower people look out for eternal blue
And all the lonely cowards cover their eyes to ignore the clue

For miles ahead Carson can see a line
Through the land where the sand is so fine
Thousands of Dharma bums marching to the rhymes
Of a song everybody knows
The magic music from the Tower of Slow

From the lonely tower people look out for shining truth
And all the lonely cowards cover their eyes to avoid the view
From the lonely tower people look out for eternal blue
And all the lonely cowards cover their eyes to ignore the clue

UH! My style hurts doesn't it?
Turn around and your hole crews loving it
Uh, you tried stiff neck thugging it
Couldn't sleep 'cause your mind had a bug in it
Buzzing without weed, extract
And you thought I wasn't coming? Well you need a slap
Let me see, chapter three, verse one, and I'm on
Wait, fore warning you of the coming of kong
Come on, splash little fishy can you swim in the pond?
Are you that, breaking the wall will your building respond?
To the pressure, walking with the strength of my predecessor
Ancient, I never walk alone
I'm up against the stereo-mono-typical
Visualising wealth is not applicable

But I ain't moving (Excuse me?)
We can't keep joking (No no no no)
Break the lock if the door's not open now (Break it down break it down)
The Globe keeps spinning (The hole damn world is)
But I ain't moving (Excuse me?)
We can't keep joking (No no no no)
Break the lock if the door's not open now

Concepts get abandoned with no gloves
Traditional trends evaporate like soap suds
The innercity whirlpool will suck you up like
A person with a temper can [fuck] you up right?
Time to bring back down to syndromes
Custard in your eye like Bugsy Malone
You need to stay calm with napalm attached to ya
Embrace arm in gasoline strike a match to ya
Now, now do you feel enlightened?
Well I don't and I'm the one writing
Anything versus everything really means nothing
Can't be a king peacock - I hate strutting
Dressed up semi-jiggy I might frustrate somethin'
A lion in the wardrobe is ready to break somethin'
Mr Fantastic Fox
the Awkward individ' that makes the wack [shit] hot
My jazz addiction is a preminition of war
When visible tussels appear on the dance floor
The sweat breaks to the beat, freak of the month, year, decade
Vacuum the essay, now lets say
I'm one in a million, a million in one room
You want an interview with the killer of monsoons?
I'll sing sonnets to don and donnettes, ok?
I'm terrible with a broom sweeping your mess away

Fall in place
This is amazing grace
I'm 808 to change the game amongst the greats
A favorite based upon the latest
Page I wrote in papers
Homies rolling papers
Toked it up and choked it out
The same way that it came
Up in the cave for two days ain't shit been the same
So today I'mma prove it
Oh God I'mma lose it
Truth is hard for the dick that don't do shit
Hitting this, get dismissed with the business
Kick this, peak this
I ain't lying
Speak my mind
Feed the lions
Keep them quiet
Moment of silence trying to keep me behind closed doors
Though the truth that if I die though I put up a fight for our lives
Put up a fight for my life
No more killin' my time, my shine's now
I pull up in the building like whoa
I told these other niggas I know
I'm from the city where the buddies might roll to your mum's house
And tell her put your hands on the wall
How you doing my dude
That's the truth to the matter of the fact
Truth is cause I did them like that
Matter fact I'ma bring it right back
Playing games, cause I did them like that
Plain game, cause I did them like that
Shit great if you came from the trap
My nigga
All that I'm hearing is sounding retarded
Either pop mollies or getting this money
Either go beaches and condos you fucking but airfare
I get it you get it that something you do
Or something you don't

I'm just out here trying to hold on the rope

Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Now what's next
Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Now what's next

Caught up in the middle
My life's a riddle
Don't let it get ya
I wanna be legal
But it's this hustle that get me richer
One love to my peoples makin' money
I can see you bubblin'
Avoid all trouble
Beware of devils continue strugglin'
Nothin's impossible if there's a will there's a way
So get your mind on official business
You can be great
And it's been this way from the cradle to the grave
So get paid
My niggaz do this every fuckin' day
We parlay
Through politics and conversation
This information to my thug niggaz in the congregation
Watch and bare witness to the pleasures of participation
Separation is self destruction
What's needed is unification
Cause the world ain't hardly scared
If not prepared
Be sure to be bummy and be no longer there
But no one cares it's there to share
All we get is stares
Because of fear we'll evaporate
Say your prayers

And what's next

Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

(Aye its on A3)
Makaveli tried to warn us
But niggaz ain't listen to Pac
Naw (listen listen) nigga really listen to Pac
Shit yean got it yet (no)
Then you won't get it
Might as well measure 'em up
And have his ass fitted
Why
Caught slippin' dog trippin' didn't soak game
Got his wig split like dem shutters on the airplane
Never will change niggaz wit' no name no shame
Might open ya head foe mess broke change
I stay posted like a flag (flag)
Starin' through my rear view ballin' in a jag (jag)
Bounce wit me Cali body rock down in H-Town
We gon' put these artificial bustas in they place now
Time foe a change
Real niggaz rollin' wit' me
Money makin' swift decision we controllin' the streets
Side track by the broads and the frauds
Ain't it strange
It's the reason so many niggaz get scarred in the game

Whatz next

Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

That money gotta make it
What I gotta do to make it
Do I really gotta take it
Put this mack up to you face it
Doin' what we gotta do to survive
Just ask Kweli doin' what we do to get by
Some niggaz stick to the crime
Pitchin' nickel and dimes
What the fuck we s'pose to do
Who gon' give us a job
So I tried and tried
Tried to get out the grind
But the block kept on callin' me back
Fiends kept on callin' for crack
So I supply 'em wit' that
Gave 'em a reasonable fee
Nigga don't blame it on me
Shit just look where I'm at
Niggaz in gardens
LAPD is the target
Niggaz is heartless hustle regardless
Look that dope spot use to be an apartment
But now it's just a place to hide the guns in the closet
Watch ya step shift the grams under the carpet
We just tryin' hard not to see that coffin

Hard livin' got me goin' insane

Something must wrong wit em, he takin' this shit for granted
Try to write up in the house with no lights, you'll understand it
I can't teach ya how to dougie, but I can teach ya bout this thuggin'
Keepin' it thorough, keep your mouth closed, nigga, keep it one-hundred
Keep yo hand up out my goddamn pocket - keep it pushin'
Keep the reefer keep the white keep the soft and just keep it cookin'
But keep in mind that any given day you can die for this
As I bag this dope I'm prayin' one day that I could just
Make an honest piece of change, prolly change the way I live
MJ, fadeaway, something niggas can't defend

So what you talkin' bout, bitch?

Really ain't shit if you ain't talk bout this
I'm runnin' laps around these rappers scratchin' em off my lists
She off that vodka so it's hard for her to stay off my dick
Tryin' get rich and let the dollars flow throughout my click
So we can break bread and never ever be broken
Yac toastin', exotic bitches on my balcony smokin
Weed turns them out without a doubt they mouth about to be open
I let Alicia put her tongue on Valerie while I‚Äôm strokin'
But I ain't Jack Tripper, I'm that nigga plain and simple
Fresh out the G to MTV, check the credentials
Ain't been a nigga bigger since the Jacksons left the city
Reppin' the hardest niggas ain't know that we was rappin' in my city
And regardless if I got support or backin' from my city
They'll remember me as the the nigga that got it crackin' for my city, nigga
And on the mic I never have off nights
Cause every line I write is straight frostbite, nigga

I'm on fire
To keep the streets hot, that's my desire
And to hell with the labels
Till it's time for us to sit down at the table
If I don't focus on me
Tell me, who will?
And I speak from my heart
So you know I'mma keep it real
So much bullshit in the last six months tried to take my focus
But on a lotta situations them people have to hocus pocus
If anybody ever asks a dumb question like ""Will BJ make it?""
Give them a dollar and say ""God bless you, cause you must be a basehead""

Hit a lick, the whip reported stolen
Tell me who out here got my back
And my dawg just got forty flat
A lot of niggas wanna hold with your four
At the end of the day man I hold my strap
And it ain't been no holding back
Hear my life told in all my raps
You probably got a problem with that

Cab slammin on Chrome trill
Bitches who pack straps in their bag

Bitch niggas talk loud
Then it's complete silence when it bark BLOW
Niggas don't never talk it out
They spark it out, then them coroners come to chalk you out
That's what it is, another unsolved mystery
Bullets don't never have a name
Niggas just aim, squeeze and bust
When your time is up, dawg you history
Like a hieroglyph, every 24/7 on survival shit
If you floss flagging niggas kill you on some rider shit
Know who you riding with, friends backstab
Bitches will get you killed, in this field for sure
It's no joke on this front line
We in the trenches with big blammers, no punchlines
Ducking the one time
Got a heart of a soldier
Ain't no fear in my eyes
First signs of submission

If ""The Price Was Right"", I could get you a whole living room
Yeah, them was my gutter ways back in the gutter days
No education, but the gutter pays
Through it all came a long way
From sellin' the yay', fist fights to gun play
Back then

Sittin' on the block and I'm doin' bad
Dreaming about the things that I never had
Got me thinking to myself ""I gotta get it man""
You can play if you want, I'm gon' get it man
I say, all my life I've known
One day eventually I'll blow

Yeah
Times is torn as it is
That's why I got guns, and my guns got kids
That's why I be goin' so tough on them hoes
I play my own hand, I don't shuffle or fold
Fuck wit a nigga, let go fuck wit some hoes
Hear them bitches screamin' like they stuck in a hole
I am not a demon, but was once a lost soul
'Til I found myself a block away from the cross road
I have, outgrown the fishbowl
And I'm on my feet like a fuckin' insole
Yeah it may hurt like a fuckin' left no
But it's ""fuck the world"", like a fuckin nympho
And we spend dough, cause we make more
And I make sure, when I say so
It's Jay Rock and Weezy, need I say more
Close line the beat tear, DB I say flow

One day eventually I'll blow

Jay Rock, still that same O.G.
I ain't tryna see the grave or the penitentiary
Everyday living, tryna stay on my feet
Even though a nigga paid, but my heart in the streets
See my dogs I'm a beast, so hard on these beats
So my family can eat, I'll be damned if I see
No income, here come Jay Rock, they know crack music
Drug kingpin flow, oh

Kingpin hoe, need I say more
Your family could die, when I say go (go)
Green light green light, whatcha green like?
Before ya sign me up, get the scene right
And I just happen to fan it when I'm being nice
Cause drivin' slow in the Lam', it doesn't seem right
Yeah, and I remember them long nights
Livin' the wrong life, but I made that wrong right
Weezy!

Highs and my lows
Look both ways, where I'm supposed to go
Ah, shit, get out my pocket

The stench from the smoke could smell so ferocious
Winos in the alley, nearly slumped over
Demons in they eyes, glassy, no Folgers
Wake up sober, kill you for a cold one
Snotty nosed rascals, big ratchet toters
Give it up slowly, click, clack, it's over
Something like Velcro, stay attached to corners
Hood rats plotting, riding for the blue cheese
All for the Gram, grams and a new weave
All they gotta spend expands, and some loose knees
Niggas taking chances, tip-toeing with two P's
No one's a simp, weak or strong they do bleed
Candle light vigils, closure if they do leave
Bullets have a name defined by different calibers
Concrete jungle, beware of different challengers

Keep beat bursting, closing down all your curtains
When shit don't go right, gotta question your purpose
Denim with them serpents coming back to surface
EBT, zero balance, worthless
You either leave in limousines or them hearses
Too much bad blood, another problem emerges
You started the problem you motherfucking deserved it
Politicking, a lot of liquor, that be the answer
They Marlboro, trying to trick them, they be the cancer

Like your name Liu Kang, that be the mantra
Stop, look, listen, that's the words to live by
Know you gotta stake your claim, like a rib-eye

Bitch niggas get they hat brought to them, you don‚Äôt communicate
Well hands and the gat talk to you, what‚Äôs the convo?
Don‚Äôt think fast, you end up getting a combo
Think situations is calm, then they bomb though
Sleeping in the bando, it‚Äôs either death or jail
Something you never planned for, dreaming about Lambos
Wake up shivering, pillow next to a lamppost
Straight up out the motherfuckin‚Äô crockpot it‚Äôs Watts
One stops leave you with dope, socks is not boxed
No rats, re-rock that got them all losing weight
Got all they teeth shot but got a sweet spot
Gotta call up Dr. Dre just for the Detox
All of this in one zip code, keep the streets hot

Whip game cold, man this shit 'bout to bubble
Big bank rolls, either hate it or love it

Grab the Glock out the trunk, other Glock in the stash
Just a regular nigga, with no chains or nothin'
If I do get some shines, you try to snatch
There's repercussions, and concussions
You know what's after that, end of discussions
I came a long way from eatin' free lunches
From Mary County checks to makin' these numbers
Oh Lord, I'm just reminiscin'
Kill the beat, some intervention on some inner vision
But I don't know, 'cause I'm just goin' with the flow
Whatever's required, I got it goin' for the low

I parted ways with my old self, I'm a new man
New face with a new stone and the blue van
Blew weight on a bad day with my loosies
Suitcase full of merchandise, that's my new plan
This my new wave, this my new tan
This my summer days in the tropics by the cool sand
This my shakin' down you niggas' pockets, I don't do friends
And I don't do trends
Fuck it though I'll ride with you then!
Bring the troops in
I'll fuck around and let 'em loose then
We'll give 'em blues then
Oh fuck it, call me Bobby ""Blue"" Bland
Aye you a fool man
Ridin' by you, swervin' at the intersection
Baby come and get your blessin'

Jay Rock,"Fly away, sometimes I wish I could fly away

There was a young ghetto child going wild after running 'round
Who came from a happy home, then got lost in the jungle
Hit a lick for like ten chicks
Brought it back to the bricks then got everybody rich
Started his own clique, recruited all piranhas
His favorite phrase: that's on hundreds
His niggas trained to go where ever he point you got shitted on
Or smoked like a joint
Here comes his line-up, first 48 people remain silent
All his goons still remain violent
Damn, there goes another body, oh shit, sirens
Another bite the dust like Mickey Thompson tires
Lights flashing, niggas stunt like the grammys
No one‚Äôs exempt, they‚Äôll sell a rock to your granny
Now here's the part where jealousy comes out to play
Hood politics official when they want you out of thee way
Now back then we ain't never mention this word
‚ÄòCause if you caught snitching consequences fo sho
Niggas'll throw you out on the freeway with a shell in your dome
And no feelings is shown
Then look inside the eyes of these killers
A blank stare, that's different than stones
Got you wondering, where in life, where they went wrong?
Don't wanna cross these types, if you do think twice
It's life saving, don't get caught slipping when you ice skating

When you stand still you can witness it all
Picture the vision from a fly on the wall
When you stand still you can witness it all
Picture the vision from a fly on the wall

Now when the sun rise, this young man sees money's a big deal
New Chevelle, wipe in the morning do cross his windshield
Killer's saturation while the smokers run through sanitation
For the bags of hands, this young man, calculating for the long run
Since ya homies been on one lately
No one's safe, he keeping his chrome off safety
Headed to the function, momma's gone, they children out cussin'
See this young man hit this bitch for all them niggas she fuckin'
Knowin' one man's been intimate touchin'
Til the big homie found out, gave his ass concussion
He don't want nothin' now, he walkin' on crutches now
Couldn't see him from the shoulders
He thinkin' how can he buck him down
Hold up, the eyes is watchin'
Gotta be more smart now, devise this option
Watch how the plot thickens
The clock tickin', his weak spot is a thot
Just notice he can't stop trickin', got him
Now this how it starts
He take a bat when he know to go play with his heart
Had his nose wide open while gettin' head at the park
She set the GPS location like this where we park
Now you know what's next
It's crazy how life can end all through a text
Got us wishin' we was all born with a vest
I know you prolly witnessed it all
But picture the vision from the fly on the walll

When you stand still you can witness it all
Picture the vision from a fly on the wall
When you stand still you can witness it all
Picture the vision from a fly on the wall

Jay Rock what up though? I'm here with you
Let's give 'em a classic, you know I'm here and prepared with you
Keep niggas inspired, you know I'm comin' to share it with you
And when the wheels fall off I'll get out and put on a spare with you
Let me be real with you, mhmm
It's been selected, let me give you my fly on the wall perspective
Sometimes niggas don't listen, I'm hopin' this serves a purpose
Cause that's some of the realest shit that you talked about in them verses
Hopin' they feel this shit despite how the devils is workin'
To avoid tellin' on myself, I try to speak in third person
See we done been through some shit, throughout my lifeline
We was flies on the wall too from the shit we seen in our lifetime
And through these songs there were digressions
Some stories we shared through music
Question if we in our right mind
Now I'm a new fuckin' fly on the wall
I wanna see how many rappers really write rhymes
And we've been rockin' for a long time, Jay Rock
They ain't got a clue of the timing
I heard about you from Slay when you started shinin'
They ain't knowin' this our fourth collab from 2009 and
Slay heard about you from my nigga Wack
But they ain't know when Top Dog introduced you, nigga
The way we out, we always give you crack
Not knowin' that we had the raw just to split you, niggas
To tell the truth there's no problem we can't solve
So let me tell the truth, again I'm so proud of how you evolved
Me and Jay Rock kill these niggas 'til they dissolve
I hope you appreciate my view as the biggest fly on the wall",Fly on the Wall,2015
Jay Rock,"Keep it one hundred, I‚Äôm one hundred and one

I ain‚Äôt tryna run a train I‚Äôm just in the caboose
And I‚Äôm tryna give these niggas the truth
I ain‚Äôt ‚Äòbout to spazz on ‚Äòem, give ‚Äòem light
I‚Äôm just doing my Zeus

I pray that you niggas all playing fair
You can‚Äôt help but stare as you face the glare, yeah
I‚Äôm not up on in short yellow
With a helmet on my head while I‚Äôm eating marshmallows
Playing jigsaw while I‚Äôm picking off devils
I can rock this shit on all levels

I‚Äôm going hard ‚Äòtil they free us

Hold up wait a minute
Let me put some season in this Gumbo
Whole lot of flavor, flavor, for you

Have you ever put your hand over fire just to see what you could tolerate?
And you can find no escape
Life is a Dominatrix waiting for shit to pollinate
To make you mind your mistakes
Keeping my chin down, nose clean, with my guards up
Charged up ‚Äòcause this ghetto got me scarred up
Yes, I‚Äôm the child with the crookedest smile
Look at my foul, look at what the star bucks
You can‚Äôt swim if you don‚Äôt paddle
Wake up in the morning with my nose to the gravel
Bloodhound, for that federal reserve note
That‚Äôs when I noticed the switch niggas just turned coats
It's the way of the world, carry the weight of the world
Carry a blade too, for they forsake you
Yeah, I‚Äôm the vision, from the night I was born
To be the eye of the tiger in the eye of the storm
I don't own a clock, ain‚Äôt no need for alarms
Just get on your A-game when it‚Äôs time to perform
Yeah, and I can show you what it feels like
The moment they want you defeated but yet you still fight
So what it feel like?

Jay Rock,"It's like you're testing me now
This my testimony, look I got that recipe now
Keep that good book on the dash with that weaponry out
Ain't no mo' rules in this game plus no referees out
All that stressing, it taught me lessons
Caught blessings, went back to stressin'
And that moment when death is present
Heavy praying and asking questions
I had no answers so I had to bottle up that aggression
Load up them hollows and I had to follow in my direction
Don't know where I'm headed I can't look back though there's nothing there
But backstabbers, snakes that slither, decisions when nothing's fair
Keeping my faith in all, even if they come take it all
Stand on my ground, I was born to fight so I'm taking off
Me and my champs on a mission, work with the baddest intention
Sharp as a scalpel incision
Gotta survive these condition, vengeance is like a tradition
If you practice what you're preaching might just get what you wish

Never thought it would be a easy, I hope we understand that
Gotta earn it when you see me, I hope we understand that
I look up at these tennis shoes over the wire
I'm looking at these tennis shoes over the wire
But no change coming

Now we have to get whatever that we after
See past the regular shit that we master
Learn to survive through love and Jezebels and street pastors
Live as free as we can cause Hell on Earth is being recaptured
I'm caught in this ghetto rapture, spirit detached
I'm smoking backwoods looking for greener pastures
Hashtag we bastards, from money change to snowflakes
The body found, a cold case, we making it out from no place
Now can you walk in these shoes with no lace
Or push that S5-50 on shoes with no plates? I don't think so
Shit is insufficient when you think slow
That's why I keep one foot in the game like a flamingo
But here's the thing though, picking my spots yelling, ‚Äúbingo""
Post it with the work, 501's with the peacoat
This ain't no New Jack City and I ain't Nino
Wondering if change gone come, but we gone see though

Never thought it would be a easy, I hope we understand that
Gotta earn it when you see me, I hope we understand that
I look up at these tennis shoes over the wire
I'm looking at these tennis shoes over the wire
But no change coming
Never thought it would be a easy, I hope we understand that

I'm straight up out that East side, swangin' like ziplines
A 4G outta rim top, automatic spit fire
Yackin' a black canister, look at this bastard go
It don't take much to aim, fingers been snatchin' souls
Out on my grind, rhymin', stacking this cash to hold
And I could take you where them niggas get bodied
But that ain't nobody business, so what the fuck is you asking for?
Look, I'm just try'na blow good dope
And put my feet to the metal of life and see just how fast it goes
Fuck the world, gotta make that bitch grab her toes
And Rock game never goofy, no weapon shall prosper
Manoeuvre like I'm Bruce Lee, ya know I'm chucks
Been doing this since a young buck
Banging for fifty cent from a victim, while my gun talk
And somebody gotta get it
And when you make a dollar, know somebody gotta spend it

The struggle is real, the struggle is real, the struggle is real
You gotta do what you got to just to get over the hill
When you live in America, either kill or be killed, yo

Lord have mercy, have mercy
I know I ain't living right and know I'm not perfect
But plus I gotta eat what I'm doing it's worth it
So, Lord have mercy

Better ask your folk, I'm never the dawg to provoke
Niggas know the status and bitches come cast their votes
In my zone with codeine and plenty of grass to smoke
I'm surpassed and broke, stay trapping for mo'
Two chicks boosting, we hooking back up in the back of the sto'
I'm the jack of many trades, steady pimping my pen
Hustle in the shade, respond in a nigga's funny ways
I was raised by winners
Niggas who park benzes up at that Staples Center
Now that gangsta nigga, I'm on some new money
Nothing but raw, pop shit, catch one in the jaw
It's gutta law, I know, you wish you was a star
What I do is internal, smoking herbal
Try'na run up in some bitches who fertal, wow
Feel like this is my moment, feel it's time for change
Excercise in game, niggas vibe the change
No looking back at it, cause this is that moment
I step forward ready to go at each and every opponent
Give it to anybody that want it
Represent the underdog, training in the gym
Tell a minute, they get they number called
I'm speed bagging it's worth, the trainers see me smashing
With persperation on the back of my shirt, making them sweat
Better yet, just look at them vets
Like when I'm in that Nicks, cashing a check, you know it's real nigga

The struggle is real, the struggle is real, the struggle is real
You gotta do what you got to just to get over the hill
When you live in America, either kill or be killed, yo

Walk mellow talk mellow, plus I'm quiet as fuck
My exterior composed, but inside I'm a nut
And after drinks and a blunt, I'm redesigning your strut
Got you rewinding and take, wiling and smiling and such
Keep your vagina in touch, dialing my line in a cut
This hydrophonic and got you hot with the bottles and bubs
On top of that, this dick and dollars done got you in love

Jay Rock,"Um, yeah palms sweating guess it's time for the murder
My nigga my nerve, I swerve left you dead on the curb
Tell his family get them black clothes
Any witness gets a 9 cold, could do this with a blindfold
I'm that player on the corner looking dry when it rains
Pimp a dollar out a pussy, I ain't trying to change
Far from average, I'm smoking this cabbage
Bottled teeth, joint karats, say cheese, make the cops freeze
Big cribs, four bars, living pipe dreams
You only gangsta through your bop screen
Might set the reason for the crime scene
Fill up the city with madness
We the reason the hearses left your hood and holding up traffic
Let the riddles do the scrapping, keep the gun in my fabric
Better pistol than them badges, you get dealt with the maggots
Heard drive-bys everyday
Seen homies die early age, though we still gang bang anyway
Uh, yeah, Figg side

Though we still gang bang anyway, uh

B's and them h's, tats on faces, Glocks with extendos
Chucking up the hood then throw like 80 out that window
The chopper make you limbo
Gotta keep them antennas up, moving down Central
Young niggas with skinnies, moving with them semis
Catch your ass leaving the club, murk you at Denny‚Äôs
Squeeze till it‚Äôs empty, it seems so unreal
'Til the gunfire got you using tables as a shield
East side, west side, niggas getting chastised
Dropping like fruit flies, we all know who die
We all go on Insta and get the whole rundown
A 15 second clip until he put the gun down
Know OG‚Äôs who took more shots like diabetics
Had that MAC paint on your face like cosmetics
Chucking up big ass B‚Äôs is my fetish
Type of shit that make you go brazy if I let it
Niggas got zippers, wheelchairs and prosthetics

Though we still gang bang anyway, uh

Hundred days, hundred nights, nigga
Let the K'ss scream 'til we see the red and blue lights, nigga
From the hoovers to the hundreds, nigga
From Kelly Park to Bounty hunters, nigga
(Watch out for the shooters)
Same age as the kids in Iraq now
LA Chiraq now, funerals is packed now
Preachers at the pulpit, Jesus is the background
Grandmother get shot walking out the church
How that sound?
Niggas don't really like it but we grew up in it
City of angels, belly of the beast get chewed up in it
Started as Black Panthers, everything power, everything pro black
Started off unified the FBI know that
A little coke sprinkled on tables but wasn't no crack
False imprisonment, huey P, Geronimo Pratt
Now close your eyes, listen to me, your mind'll go back
Picture us chained together under the boat, that's a Kodak
And since today is Thursday, let me hit you with a throwback
Stolen identities, God left us here without lowjack
Forced to find ourselves, forced to break up outta chains
Got tired of getting hanged so we started our own gangs
Tookie Williams (Crip), Sylvester Scott (Blood)
Seventy two Lil' Country caught a slug
And that was the first time a crip ever killed a blood
Now the shit is worldwide cause it is what it was
We know the history and we know the shit could end any day

Jay Rock,"The devil thought he had me, I was on back burners
Moon walking fast, y'all respect my journey
Evil tapping in like the Feds was watching
No album, no dope, I was all out of options
I'd rather rob than get a job don't insult me
Remember it was nicks and dimes in '03
I was doing bad so I took your bag
Tables turned, lessons learned, karma come back fast
Flipped off that bitch, Milly Rocking the wheel
200 thousand in the bank straight to hospital bills
Momma still got the shakes, praying I'm all right
Dreams of enemies in the lobby when they hit the lights
So many niggas be wishing they was you bro
Same niggas that hit you with that ""I love you bro""
Tread softly see the snakes coming I pop em off me, nigga
My life costly

Bitch where? Tell me you a real one, bitch where?
Tell me you gon' kill some, bitch where?
Say you in the field huh? bitch where?

Battle scars and tribulations, downfalls from the situations
I bounced off with dedication, accounted for my participation
Getting pounds off, getting rounds off
Getting blocks back I facilitated
When I sound off, you a groundhog
That's a casket and a pillar waiting
Magic in a dope spot, four chickens that's Popeye's
More spinach that's pot pie, four women sipping Mai Thais
I'm a cold nigga, free my guys
Free PI, free Poota May
Free shooter ray from the foul line
We gon' get money or die tryin'
Jay Rock and I'm back bitch, watch out, blow your back, bitch
Be cool, gotta relax bitch, I'm only speaking facts, bitch
I been through the bullshit to the pulpit up shits creek
Been a nuisance to my OG, got a new sense 2018
Put that on the Bloodiest, whip clean, I'm the Bloodiest
Bitch cling on the Bloodiest, pull up, I'mma fuck with it
Slide in for the tape deck, got a best friend just say less
Fake threats, I'mma fade that, either pay checks or I pay debt

Can I do my shiznit?
Can I be specific?
Can I chase this grip without looking too big for my bridges?
Am I too prolific?
The vision my pugilistic moods insisted
Food come from them tools he so choose to use
Now Harriet Tubman say she freed a thousand slaves
Could've freed a thousand more if they was aware of the chains
What's under the rugs remainin' unexplained
Truth is mostly taboo
Even when it's staring back at you like a enemy tattoo
Refusing to play the statue, I take action
Without quitting until I reach my point of satisfaction
Not giving a crap what happens
I'm just part of a winning family, call me Marlon Jackson
As I'm working hard to get my spin right
Morphine and Novocaine, dull the pain

Pessimistic thoughts, carrying the bricks, we trying to find some hope

Give me a light, let's smoke
You either chasing this dirty money or living righteous broke

B is for the blood
R is for the ropes
O is for the opression
K is for the kush, needed just to cope
E is for the evolution, it's for this resolution
Now have you ever been broke, sick of forever losing?

The damage is done but who's to blame
Finger pointing, naming names
Nobody willing to pay that full admission to ride the gravy train
Death is a part of life, happens daily, gotta face the pain
I be limping through it with lacerations, both my ankles sprained
Can't rely on politics, all that 1%, the game power
Daily giving kibbles to let that own your life for 8 hours
Poison get to waters, make it hard, safely take showers
Nobody put in place to keep it straight, so now we slang powder
Chasing paper, aiming lasers at the opposition
Can't play with these streets and say you positive
It's a contradiction
I ain't have no pot to piss in
Had to make some tough decisions
Tired of dealing with these broke conditions

Back in the projects
I lost it all
Now I'm back in the projects

Big shots, hardcore drugs
Everything crooked, what you thought this was?
Steam pot, turned powder into rock
Plan go sour, that's how you get got
Aw shit, got it popping into bricks
Part of playing cool, now it's time to get rich
Keep in mind, never walk around block

I can't get all of you in it

All that back and forth gets me hot sometimes
Wanna see somebody get locked up, just box one-time, shit
Catch a fade, catch a fade, it ain't nothin'
Get your head up, at the gym, bring your knuckles
Look, I'm deep inside the projects where its bracken at
You know the zip
Where we take a quarter piece
Flip it, tell the corner lit
A1 yola, that fresh over the border shit
Shoot outs and abortions, situations so unfortunate
I knew a nigga, doing double digits, bust the head wide
For another nigga, who's scared to rep his set right
Now in solitary doing push ups by his bedside
All he want is a green dot, this homie keeping himself fly
Don't come around without your pass, niggas on they tip
Zero tolerance on niggas money, niggas want they shit
Don't start nothing without your blood, that's a one way trip
Six feet under real life that's all gunplay is

Jumping out of smoking rentals, K's with the wood grips

All red flags, swag on ten
We ain't in the club, we can't get our goods in
So we in the hood, let you wasters look grim
One time circling for colors of your skin
Black lives matter out here, no way
Cops get promotions while the family gotta pray
It's fucked up
Can't explain babies all in a dump truck
It's all about that money mane, miss me with that Trump stuff
Tryna make a dollar outta fifteen, don't get fucked up
You're shaking the bag, get a buck then you lucked up
You faking, you mad, you got a issue, you get fucked up
Get laid on yo' ass, you feeling bad your blunt's crushed up
We in the set, just bickin' it like the Cosbys
Tryna get dope, live happy days like Chachi

Credit cards, profiles, bank's always open
And if I smash, do the dash, that's hocus pocus
She 'bout cash, I ain't mad, I'm just not devoted
To fall in love with, doing exotic drugs and playing inside of clubs
I'm never the one to cuff
She like, ""Johnny, you know this pussy yours and only yours
Take the rubber off and smoke passion, you could explode""
Is it worth it?
She see me on TV telling the girls about me
And all she saw was a Benz and thought the world about me
She think her nigga a lick and I got rapper money
And child support is the legal way she can ask for money

Did I confuse you girl
Did I give you a sign
Coz this is not what we plan to do
I thought we'd talk it out
You told me that you didn't mind
At the time you understood
It was only for the night

Baby you know
Gotta let go
Come on act right
It was only one night

I told you, you got to allow this style
Coz I'm not ready girl, you can't persuade me to stay
Girl I'd like you to understand it was only for the night
You told me that, now you wanna act
Like I told you I'd commit but it's more then I can give
Was this all a plan, turn a one night stand
Into more than we agreed, I can't give you what you need baby

Baby you know
Gotta let go
Come on act right
It was only one night
Baby you know
Gotta let go
Come on act right
It was only one night

Girl I can see that you're hurt
But I didn't think that you would go back on your words
How am I supposed to change what is done it's too late
Girl I'm starting to believe that we made a mistake

It was for one night
Babygirl if you'd told me then it'd been alright
Now you're telling all your friends that I'm your man

Jay Sean,"There wasn't anything I didn't love about you,
You'd do some stupid things and I'd laugh at those too,
And we went together like the summer in June
But who'd have known that it'd rain so soon

Thought I'd be the only one that'd make you smile,
Thought I'd be the only one that'd really know how
But you showed me different and I know better now,
I gotta get you out my system somehow

I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we 'ain't even friends,
You could've been my all or nothing, all or nothing,
Now to me you're nothing, girl you are nothing, now you're nothing

Put you on a pedestal, girl I held you so high
Was never too good at finding the words to describe,
Just how I felt for you but you know that I tried,
But somehow we went and changed inside

You damn near were my everything you're still on my mind,
But I'd rather be here all alone and I'm doin' just fine
Gotta take it back to the days before we met
And live our lives as strangers again

I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we 'ain't even friends,
You could've been my all or nothing, all or nothing,
Now to me you're nothing, girl you are nothing, now you're nothing

I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we 'ain't even friends,
You could've been my all or nothing, all or nothing,
Now to me you're nothing, girl you are nothing, now you're nothing

December days, my summer turned to winter
When you went away, I can't help but wonder
Was he worth my pain, you should know better, and I should've too
And I cried, and you cried and we tried to make it work,
Almost died while we tried, is that what our love was worth,
If I could do it again, I would be a better man,
Now I'm living with just memories

I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we 'ain't even friends,
You could've been my all or nothing, all or nothing,
Now to me you're nothing, girl you are nothing, now you're nothing

I replay it over and over again

Now I know, that I might've done you wrong,
Didn't know I'd pay so long, 'til you did the same

I know I'd done you wrong I was making it up to you,
I apologized in a million ways but I thought that was that,
But I guess you got me back,
Didn't know it'd be like that, but you did the same

Now we're caught in a circle
A constant battle
The day that you hurt me
The clouds cast a shadow on us
And I hope that your happy we're even now, so cry baby cry

Let me see you cry, cry, cry
I need to see you cry, cry, cry
Until your tears run dry, dry, dry

Want ya tears to fall down on me

I need to see you cry, cry, cry
Until your tears run dry, dry, dry
Like the deserts need the rain
Want ya tears to fall down on me

Before the love just turns to hate,
Before I ask for you to stay,
And just before you walk away, yeah

What is this? What happens to relationships?
Started off so good and ended up so bad
Baby I just wanna know,
Ooh tell me do you know, baby

Before we knew it we were at it again,
No no no, somehow I don't think we can ever be friends,
Wish it wasn't so, wish it wasn't so, but you did the same

So we go on and on on this merry go round,
Trying to chase a love that can never be found,
Time to say goodbye and step off of it now,

I need to see you cry, cry, cry,
Until your tears run dry, dry, dry,

How can I change a million minds in this lifetime
What is it I have to do
If I erase my history, what defines me
If I let them change all I knew
Would I be good enough for you?

I wish they looked at me and they could see beyond
Everything they think I am
Cause pedigree don't make a man
Don't have to dig too deep to see I'm just like you
What is it they want from me, tell me what more can I prove
Why so many can't understand, when it comes you and I
I don't fit in their descriptions, though I try
Gotta change those old traditions

That it hurts but I do it again
I don't change, I don't learn, cause I can't let it in
Said it's gone, let it be, 'cause you don't need a friend
Baby I do,
I pull and you push and we cry
Til we laughing again, I
Promise you, you promise me backin' and why
Does it all fall apart in just a matter of time

So I'm thinking maybe
You've made up your mind
Cause you're distant (distant )
And I can't stand to fight no more
So please don't make me hurt you like I do
I don't really trust myself to leave,
Even though I hear you sayin' baby no, no
(no, no, no no no, no no)
I can't take no more of this and
I'm knock, knock, knockin' on your door
Askin' if you still let me in
Won't you stay
(ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
Won't you stay?

Memories of the fun that we had in photographs on the wall
Now I can't make you smile or hear you laugh anymore
And I can't help but ask, what's the point of it all
Tell me baby,
Call it love, call it lame, call it joy, call it pain
But I fell, call it girl what you may is but it's painful as hell
To be here while you're there don't need nobody else

So I'm thinking maybe
You've made up your mind
Cause you're distant (distant )
And I can't stand to fight no more
So please don't make me hurt you like I do

Askin' if you still let me in
Won't you stay
(ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
Won't you stay?

If your so meant for me?
And if I'm so meant for you?
Why does this have to be so hard on both of us two?
If your so meant for me?
And if I'm so meant for you?
Why does this have to be so hard on both of us two?

Still you're sayin' (no, no, no no no, no no)
I can't take no more of this and
I'm knock, knock, knockin' on your door
Asking if you still let me in
Won't you stay
(ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)

Forget bout all those years, and I
I can't take the thought of him
Alone with you (alone with you)
Its been a year or so, and you
Moved on and left me cold, and I
I wish that I could let you know
That I still got a thang for you

But you got another man
He says he loves you too
Baby girl I understand
This must be hard on you
And it gets so hard sometimes
To know just what to do
Stuck in the middle with you

You and I
Through it all
Sunny days
Through the storms
Still I know
That he can never love you like me
Girl I know he and you
Going new he messed it up with it all
No he can never love you like me
Can we go back again as lovers not as friends
Ccause I know
That he can never love you like me
Girl I've been there before
Time to close it up and go right on
But he can never love you like me

I was the one you can run into
When tears would fall from what he do
Who knew the friends would become lovers
Going crazy giving my all but getting halfa you
I'm not half the man so tell me what to do
Never gonna let you go
'cause you know our love is true

But you got another man
But he's not good for you
Baby girl I understand
But this ain't all on you
And it gets so hard some time
To know just what to do
Stuck in the middle with you

You and I
Through it all
Sunny days
Through the storm
Still I know
That he can never love you like me

Time to close up and go right on
But he can never love you like me

I know
That you will never find another love like
Me and you can look but won't find another man like
Me and even though you might have separated from me
Gotta make a choice can't wait forever

You and I

Jay Sean,"I was crazy man you wouldn't believe what I seen
Got me reminiscing down too much memories
The only girl you know that in my heart
The one I almost gave that ring

But we were so young, must've been only nineteen
I guess the time wasn't right and we said some mean things
A bitter day when I saw her face
She was the one that I let get away

I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her
I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her
The time goes on, goes on, goes on
The time goes on, goes on, goes on

There was talkin' in the room that everything's good
There was no love lost between us I couldn't
Believe how I truly noticed now that I wasn't over her

And now I'm like oh damn cause now I know man
Lookin' back at all our pictures while I'm playing slow jams
What can I say, is that the way our situation worked out
Wish there was something I could do

Like stop the clock just lookin'
Go back and revisit our relationship and start brand new
And do the things that I didn't do

I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her
I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her
The time goes on, goes on, goes on
The time goes on, goes on, goes on

Man I know it's crazy
She pulled me back with just a smile
Now I feel these things inside
I haven't felt em' in a while
And I'm sure that they will go away just a little time

Jay Sean,"(Let me feel you)

It's been about a month and twenty days
And were going 'round and 'round playing silly games
Now your saying, slow it down, not right now
Then you wink at me and walk away

Now, let it be, let it be, let it be known
Hold on, don't go
Touching and teasing me, telling me no
But this time I need to feel you

(Ride it) we are all alone
(Ride it) just loose control
(Ride it, ride it) come touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) baby let me feel you
(Ride it) turn the lights down low
(Ride it) from head to toe
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you

MoVida was the club on Saturday
Your acting like a diva saying you don't wanna pay
It's gotta be your feisty style
Raised that brow
I love it when you look at me that way
Now when you order a Mohita at the bar
Reapplying lippy 'cause it came off from the glass
The DJ plays your favorite song
Kanyes on
Now your backing in from me to dance
Mm, pulling me, pulling me, pulling me close
You close your eyes girl
Whispering, telling me we gotta go
Won't you take me home I wanna

(Ride it) we are all alone
(Ride it) just loose control
(Ride it, ride it) come touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) baby let me feel you
(Ride it) turn the lights down low
(Ride it) from head to toe
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you

Everything was right until her phone began to ring
She takes it to the corner, that's when I start wondering
I can hear her shouting, banging her fist against the door
Yelling ""Yo, it's over, I can't take it anymore""
Then I walk away, and acting I want to go chill
I ain't trying to get caught up in a mess for real
But she came around and backed me up against the wall
She said I know you heard, but I'll make you forget it all

Baby let me feel you

(Ride it) we are all alone
(Ride it) just loose control
(Ride it, ride it) come touch my soul

Jay Sean,"I would march across the dessert, to defeat my enemy
And I would lie here in the trenches, with your picture next to me
And when I told you it's forever, then that's how it's gonna be
Don't, won't let him, just take the place of me, no

Does he really know you like, I know you all the little things
Does he really love you like I love you, how can he compete
If he makes me fight for you, die for you, would he do the same
This has turned into way more than a game

Now it feels like, soldiers in a war, and none of us are backing down,
And I will show you victory is mine, before we leave this battle ground
'Cause he don't leave and he don't wanna go
And I know just how this battle goes
He don't wanna leave, and I don't wanna fight this kind of war

You know hes not the man you think he is, hes hiding all his flaws
So tell me whats the point in fighting, cause we'll all end up with scars
But girl if that's what I must go through, then I'm not prepared to lose
'Cause I've already bled so much for you, no

Does he really know you like, I know you all the little things
Does he really love you like I love you, how can he compete
If he makes me fight for you, I'd die for you, would he do the same
Baby this has turned into way more than a game

And I will show you victory is mine, before we leave this battle ground
'Cause he don't wanna leave and I don't wanna go
And I know just how this battle goes
He don't wanna leave, and I don't wanna fight this kind of war

I'm getting kind of sick of this battle
Wish I can take it back to when I had you
I'm almost thinking that he can have you
Just let him have you

It's getting kind of hard to convince you
After all the shit that we've been through
Why would you let all this happen?
You got a choice to make it stop,
It's already gone to far girl

We're soldiers in a war, and none of us are backing down,
And I will show you victory is mine, before we leave this battle ground

'Cause he don't wanna leave and I don't wanna go

Headed to the pen now he back up on the slab,

Hundred G's in cash,

The dump truck,
A stash spot,
Then came up,
It's more 1's nigga,
Versace sheets,
Serve is more money in a new fleet

Bought a new Phantom,
Suede with the gators
Brand new Louis always ready to spray it,
Like father like son,
Money is a must,
These hoe's we don't trust,
Brand new trucks,
Shined every summer,
Ran wit the numbers,
Stash spot cool got a 50 piece humming
Back up on my saddle nigga hustle for my shine,
Just an ordinary nigga on a million dollar grind,
Big timer old school, new school nigga,
Is more money homie,
More money more money more money homie,
My bitches paid Cavalli shades,
Blowin' haze, everyday

Flip another hundred,
Get another Hundred,
Spend another Hundred,
Burn another Hundred,
Blow another Hundred,
Fuck another Hundred,
Get big money nigga, stuntin' on a hundred,
50 whips extra clips did it for the sunshine,
Garbage bag full hard body wit' a fire line,
Flip another brick, drink a little dip,
Stunna Island nigga shinin' wit a bad bitch,
A-R nigga, riding skinny tires,
Fully loaded high when you floatin' in the sky,
Rockin' Gucci blades, ridin' triple blades,
Tatts on the face, of nigga's been paid

And these niggas ain't shit like their constipating
I get the coupe with the kit
Watch me lobster red it
Drop the top at the light that's when I be heading

Most of the time when a player shove it. I like that ass a lot but I never love it. See I'm gonna keep that, keep it fly. And I thought I'd be a player until the day I die. But somehow you got up in my dome. And begged JT to take ya home. Once we got there, all was good. You put it on a pimp like I didn't think you could. Your super thick and extra pretty. The kinda chick you usually find up Magic City. Her eyes were green and her skin was brown. I looked, wow, and then Mamacita kicked me down.

That was when she had no doubts about us

Then her heart changed like a whippin' winter wind

I'll never love again

Like I did in Dallas


I don't get wrapped up in the moon

I don't believe in all it's magic

I don't think too many dreams come true

Or that everybody wins


REPEAT CHORUS x2


Oh, I did in Dallas

I miss Dallas


",I Did in Dallas,2005
Jay Thomas,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you
",Getting Sentimental Over You,1989
Jay Thomas,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Jay Thomas,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Jay Ungar,"The sun is sinking low in the sky above Ashokan
The pines and the willows know soon we will part
There's a whisper in the wind of promises unspoken
And a love that will always remain in my heart

My thoughts will return to the sound of your laughter
The magic of moving as one
And a time we'll remember long ever after
The moonlight and music and dancing are done

Will we climb the hills once more?
Will we walk the woods together?
Will I feel you holding me close once again?
Will every song we've sung stay with us forever?
Will you dance in my dreams or my arms until then?

Under the moon the mountains lie sleeping
Over the lake the stars shine
They wonder if you and I will be keeping
The magic and music, or leave them behind",Ashokan Farewell,1991

(Anderson Howe Wakeman Bruford Dowling)
She gives me love
When love had gone away
When the pressure came so fast
She give me love
Long distance runaround
And in between the pressure
I was summoned

How did we dance on the south side of the sky
We saw the flags flying on the moon
And through the gates of delirium so fast
Believing in the light was a beginning
Only to believe in you
Only to believe in you

When I was losing fast
I was awakened by the dream
She was the love for me
the first and last
And all that I remembered
Was the roundabout only to believe in you

I hold you near me, oh darling hear me
I have a message I must impart

Yours 'til the stars lose their glory
Yours 'til the birds fail to sing
Yours to the end of life's story
This pledge to you dear, I bring

Yours in the grey of December
Here or on far distant shores
I've never loved anyone the way I love you
How could I, when I was born to be
Just yours
Just yours
When I was born to be just yours",Yours,2000
Jay Wilbur,"I'm the verbal-spit Smith & Wesson
I unload with sick spit
The quick wit could split a split-second
Bomb with a lit wick expression
You here a tick tick then you testin'
My saliva and spit can split thread into fiber and bits
So trust me, I'm as live as it gets
Everybody claiming they the best and they head the throne
Since B.I.G is gone, if you ask me, they ""Dead Wrong""
My flow is hotter than the flash from the click
When the hammer slaps the bullet on the ass from the clip
You wind up in a room full of my dogs
I'll have you feeling like a fire hydrant in a room full of dogs
So come, come now, get pissed on, shitted on
Tough talk turns to, ""Can't we all just get along""
You get blazed when the mic's off, shot when it's on
You probably ducked when they laid the gun shot in your song
My gun stutters when it speaks to you
Utter shit to repeat to you
Nothing the clip, then give a speech to you
Me and Premier, we kind of the same in ways
We both speak with our hands in dangerous ways
Rap now is a circus of clowns
A whole lot of lip from cliques I'd probably rap circles around
I'm the next best to reach a peak formerly known
As the best keep secret, I guess that I just leaked it

""Tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb""
""Boom..boom, bam, God-damn!"" 
""Royce 5'9""
""Tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb""
""Boom..boom, bam, God-damn!"" 
""Royce 5'9""

I'm a motherfuckin' star, I don't battle no mo'
I provide the gun clapping a round of applause after your show
We can go toe-to-toe cause they calling you hot
Stepping around all your punches like, ""That's all you got?""
Everyday I'm meeting somebody and all of they peeps
Quick to shake a nigga's hand and show me all of they teeth
And these bitches I be patting they asses
They be all dumb and googly-eyed looking at me, batting they lashes
Rappers think Detroit niggas not as down as them
Or since I'm down with Slim that I sound like him
Quick to judge me and tell me that my hook might sell
And say faggot shit to me like I look like L
My advice quit talking it's over
I was knocking niggas out when you was knocking sticks off of their shoulders
I got dirt done in my past, I know y'all sweat
I got regrets older than some of you so called vets
Niggas say I found God with the flow
Bring the police to the studio and bring the bomb squad to the show
Ain't a nigga touching mines
When you listen to my shit - you don't chew, you don't breathe
You'll miss a fucking line
Every time I spit, I tick to show you it's hot
Leave me in the deck too long I blow up your box: boom!",Boom,2001

But now I see, what one embrace can do

And cheerful greeting
Long lines of cars
And lovers meeting
Under the stars

Velvety dark
The trees in the park

Their windows beaming
Chiming of bells
The river gleaming

Be more than yearning?

Who gon represent for Texas, like I represent for Texas
And who this nigga talking down on Dirty South, niggaz rapping reckless
Scared took him out of the hotel, 'cause when Ro swang Ro swell
Eyebrows and jaws, so in my presence Mr. don't tell
I'm a motherfucking murderer, you the wanksta
Popping that gangsta shit on the radio, and it's disturbing you
Big Moe nigga that's my big dog, and my love ain't never gon withdrawal
So we clicked up coming to get why'all, my nigga Ja said you's a bitch dog

Fucking with the fire bitch nigga you freezing, then you burn

And can't nobody stop it, because the reaper's coming to cancel every one of us
And it's all gravy, all of my niggaz are hard plus we all crazy
Wishing I can be a peaceful man and, hoping that the Lord save me
Fuck a nigga named 50 Cent, you nothing but change
I'm a whole dolla nigga, hanging one in your brain

Mob figgas representing, and we here to do the job
Got my step-on nigga shoes on, 'case it get dirty
'Cause man it's going down, in the Thirty
It's for war thirty, fuck President Bush
If he was close to the edge, then I'll give him a push
And do this whole world a favor, hey there howdy neighbor
Shit, I'm sorry I took so long to save you
I was getting my dick sucked, by my secretary
She asked me my sign, I told her bitch Aires
I stay on Barbary and Scott, 5000 block
I paint the white house black, and start renting it out

In this underground game, I'm rolling with S.L.A.B
Black H2 Hummers, when we holding the Avenue
Got a itching trigga finger, when I'm holding my strap
Nigga they call me hit man, don't get your wig pushed back
Man some of these niggaz, is bitches too
Steady riding my dick, like bitches do
You a gangsta or a hoe, nigga which is you
Archie Lee been real, before I had a crew
Get it right don't get it wrong, I stay's in the zone
Plus my piece got yellow stones, like I stayed on the Stone
I spit that hood shit, that wood shit
Hershelwood for life, matter fact it's all good bitch

I heard a nigga in the game, was saying my name
But now my glock is fully loaded, and ready to aim
S-L-A-be until I'm gone, and I'm repping it strong
You don't want to see these gorillas, running up in your home
Everybody better clear the lot, when the lights off
I set it off, when I luger ride for the cause
And fuck the law, I'ma mash till I'm finished and done
And when it's all said and done, I'ma be number one

And sweep up, that street

Watch a nigga bob and weave, and then we break jaw

Ready for war boy we raw, I thought I told you cats
Who was the nigga that had to bust, and make the crowd move back
Never slacking or lacking, still attacking like I'm Sadaam
Set it off like the chirp that's going off, on the alarm
Doing harm nigga we swarm, on any and every hater in sight
Fuck around and call a nigga Teddy, steady turning off your lights
Night lights gon get burned, fucking with paper that I earned
S.L.A.B. gladiating on hating, see you cats gon learn

It's Jay'Ton, motherfuckers and if they don't know the name
From the wild wild West, slugging em like Jesse James
Dog better get the fuck back, 'fore I fuck around and leave a nigga flat
With a cardiac heart attack, slugs stuck off in your back
See I ain't tripping mayn, I'm one of the young guerillas
That's stacking scrilla, slash a killa cause I'm a made nigga
You don't want to get hauled on, or straight clicked on
I've been a G ever since the day, that I left home

S-L-A-be	, one of these motherfuckers finna see
I've been a sad cat with a fat cat all the way back, still spitting with heat
One of the rap game phenomenon's, me and my click be ready for war
You better get your entourage, 'fore you get calicoes through your car
Or you'll get a 44 to your jaw, ain't no love boxing we raw
And if you really think that we playing, step in the ring so you can get scarred
Guerillas ready for havoc, on a mission to let you have it
To tell the truth I done had it, this game is really fin to get tragic
I ain't having when I'm busting on first and ten, I'ma be rushing
Till a nigga left with concussions, bring the end of discussion dog
You don't want to get me pissed off or ticked off your ass is fin to get pissed on
Not dissed on but clicked on, for stepping inside my zone

50 Cent, baby that's nothing but chump change
Shooting slugs at my partna, disrespecting the game
So feel this verbal cocaine, your whole tape was trash
Now the whole Screwed Up Click, gon beat that ass
So when you come in H-Town, don't hide behind your circle
We gon' tear the club up, leave both your eyes purple
Hurt you bitch nigga, that's from the Boss Man
I'm known for slapping boys, knocking em out with my hands
Understand bow down, and show some respect
We clicked up and heated, with knives hanging round our neck

So call the ambulance, and put this bitch up on some ice

What have you done?
What have you done?

Down the corner got your name
Nothing more could piss me off
Like five nights in a travel lodge
Rock the mic, not turned on
Something tells me, somethings wrong
This won't work, pen and ?
Wish the time would travel faster

I can't wait until the morning
Went downstairs the telly's boring ?
I can't wait until the morning
Pack my bags and then I'm going

Oh you've more brain that Steven Hawkin
Just like him you shut up talking
One more day and then I'm walking
Your people skills are so appauling
All the time I'm so alive

And begin to dream

Turn off the light 
Sit down on the couch 
Pour me a whiskey too 
Take off your dress 
I'll help you with that

Gets to my head 
As the smoke from your cigarette do 
With Monk in the speakers 
And love in your eyes 
I fantasize of you 

I know I'm only dreaming 
Of spending my life with you 
But somehow I'm still believing 
It all one day will come true 

The ice in my glass 
Makes my lips so cold 
As I kiss you from top to toe 
You beg me to stop 
But I know you want more

When the world is fast asleep
I sit by candlelight with memories

I'd like to hold you in my arms just like before

I thought I could live without you

You were standing on the porch as I drove up the driveway as lovely as one can be
You would make any man so grateful of living and you choose a man like me

Though I work all day and sometimes all evening I never had no complaints
We've been friends though fighting that's why I'm writing a letter to lulu-mae

How am I supposed
To know when you're not talking
And feel when you don't show
The chain around your neck will strangle you soon
All that you still conceal
The gum that you chew will suffocate you
Secrets you should reveal

I who tried to focus on every need
Turned into an actor
When showing how I feel
The chain around your neck will strangle you soon
All that you still conceal
The gum that you chew will suffocate you
Secrets you should reveal

Such a big mistake
And don't you dare deny
It's hidden and forgotten

I search all over the world for you

Laid sleezy hands upon what's mine

The sly seducer, the sly seducer, the sly seducer stole my love

Vampire-teeth in virgin-necks
And paralyses them with words

Promise to act like grown-ups do
Is it in my genes or jeans I do not know
Stuck in a never-ending daydream
A well-hidden secret all those years
It's understood I send my regards to you

Tears of joy to tears of despair
Scratches my back with razor-sharp nails
The queen is gone and there's no time to speak
Still in an ever-lasting nightmare
The song of a ghost is following me
A salted truth out of false belief

A ray of bright light
Reflecting like a mirrorball
Leaves sunstains on me

You walking out on me
And leave me standing all alone

Well, it might be foolish of me
There will be other girls that I will meet

Jay-Jay Johanson,"You better watch your step
You must be on your guard and take it slow
And promise me be careful of what you do
I know you're strong
I know you'll make it on your own without my help
But please make sure you won't be by yourself

Everytime I hear my song on the radio
I keep moving closer and closer to you
Everytime the DJ is playing my song
I can feel you here by my side all night long

You gotta try much harder
Take it from the start and try again
You gotta be much faster if you can
You probably will fail
No matter how you try it's not enough
It takes so much to make it to the top

Everytime I hear my song on the radio
I keep moving closer and closer to you
Everytime the DJ is playing my song
I can feel you here by my side all night long

Let's go down
To the dance floor if you dare
Now's the time
To show that you're not scared",On the Radio...,2003
Jay-Jay Johanson,"It started out quite badly
It only got worse
She said that it depended on
What's mine but I know
It depended on what's hers
It could have been perfect
I guess you thought it was
You didn't understand what
Was wrong 'til I told you
It wasn't worth the cost
I thought it would be easy
To break up with you
But now when we've reached
This certain point I'm no
Longer sure how to do
Of course you won't be sorry
You've always said you're bored
It's better if it ends right
Here and now or maybe it'll
End up in the morgue
Oh darling please
You believe in me
I believe in you
How come that you don't believe in us

But I don't get no lovin' and that's no lie
We spent the night in Frisco at every kinda disco
From that night I kissed our love goodbye

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

That nasty boogie bugs me, but somehow how it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
I've changed my life completely, I've seen the lightning leave me
And my baby just can't take her eyes off me

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie, woo

I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't, I just can't

Sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

This magic music grooves me, that dirty rhythm fools me
The Devil's gotten to me through this dance
I'm full of funky fever, a fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a super trance

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't you blame it sunshine

Hear her voice

Who will love and treat me real nice

And my love, she will know

Children of a lesser God when your melanin‚Äôs got a tint
And I can‚Äôt even mention what I sent or what I spent
'Cause my name in 18 wheelers is evidence
I put my boos in those cruise collections
Life‚Äôs a bitch
A to Z on her shoe collection, take your pick
Paid in full like ‚Äô86, Gs on my body
The new Gucci has less monograms, God‚Äôs got him
Let he without sin cast the first stone
So I built that all glass quad level first home

14-year drug dealer and still counting
Who deserves the medal of freedom is my accountant
He been hula hooping through loop holes, working 'round shit
IRS should‚Äôve had the townhouses surrounded
Thanks to the lawyers
I marbled the foyer
I tore the floor up
Yeah, that‚Äôs for Koi fish
We been dining on oysters
I walk through the garage it‚Äôs like multiple choices
I told ‚Äòem pull the Royce up
I‚Äôm getting ghost, I‚Äôm hearing noises
I think it‚Äôs the boys, but I been banking at Deutsche
We got storefronts, we got employee stubs
We been opening studios and 40/40s up
The paper trail is gorgeous
Cases we buries ‚Äòem
Before Reasonable Doubt dropped, the jury hung
Bling bling
Every time I come around your city bling bling
My tenure took me through Virginia
Ask Teddy Riley ‚Äòbout me
Ask the Federalis ‚Äòbout me
Tried to build a cell around me
Snatched my nigga Emory up
Tried to get him to tell about me
He told 12, ‚ÄúGimme 12‚Äù
He told them to go to Hell about me
Drug dealers anonymous
Y‚Äôall think Uber‚Äôs the future, our cars been autonomous
Mules move the drums, take ‚Äòem to different spots
We just call the shots by simply moving our thumbs
I‚Äôm a course of miracles with this shit
Nothing real can be threatened, nothing unreal exists
Therein lies the piece of God
I always knew I was a prophet, but I couldn‚Äôt find a decent job
Life made me ambidextrous

Cruisin' down the west-side, highway
Doing what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl wit' me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel; it's true to the heart
She rides with me--the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during ""Sex and the City""
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together--how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend

The problem is you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
Dat ain't 'bout nothin
If ever you mad about somethin', it won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no, you won't see that
And, no, I ain't perfect; nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But, girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' at Hermes, Birkin' bag
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry--only worry is him
She'd do anything necessary for him
And I'd do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yup

[Chorus]

(Talk to 'em, B)
If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you if somebody hurts you
Even if the somebody was me
(Break it down for 'em, B)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend

Your mouth running, but where is you going?
What is you smoking, man? That ain't potent
What is you talking, man? That ain't important
Illuminati, High society
We in this party and nobody invited me
We going crazy and I always use my best sense
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxin', relaxin, shootin' some pool and
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre
You just look stupid to be ignoring
The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium
And parties at Richie is getting risky
Victoria's Secret show, they miss me
Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed
Ah, get out my fucking head
It's just me and my bad bitch
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us nigga
Cause I don't really trust niggas
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon' make it, that's on everything
Truest girls get half naked, every spring
They saying, ""Hey Kanye
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,""
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio, man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower.. that's what's up
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck

So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh right away
At first sight I felt energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
So shine bright tonight you and I

[Ludacris]
Now this is what they call poetry in motion
My soul bleeds on the paper, heart screems with emotion
This my daily devotion, the verses stay deaper then the ocean
So hip hop you owe me a promotion
Yea I do a little boasting and bragging
Whats all the commotion and nagging about?
Cuz Im Still the Champ in the south
Cuz rappers get in the booth and I keep dragging them out
For they fire at these pink slips im handing them out
Cuz this is theatre of the mind
Considerate a sign of whats to come next
My moneys just fine bank filled with dumb checks
Terrorist threat flow, proceed to drop bombs like mr.pump flex
But I don't do it for the money, I do it from the heart
I do it with the beatbox, I did it from the start
I do it for the DJ's, I do it for the chart's
The fan gel flow,luda do it cuz it's art
I do it for the fans, I do it on command
I do it for the front row, I do it for the stands
I spit it for the hood, I do it for the block
It's Nine Years old, I did it for HIP HOP!

I don't do it for the cars and the fancy drops
I do it for HIP HOP... I do it for HIP HOP... I do it for HIP HOP...
And I don't do it for the chains and the flashing rocks
I do it for HIP HOP... I do it for HIP HOP... I do it for HIP HOP...

I do it for HIP HOP and never ever stop
Till I get copped, popped, or arrested and locked up
Not for the lowrider with the chrome T-Top
Not for the money that can cop any shop
Not for any Hot Mamas, But nonstop change like obama
No need for drama yo I do it for my soul
To hold and control what I can and thats the goal
To puncture a hole in the bag and leak the movement
Improvement thats the destination, provin the obligation
Chainging the population, making the situation
Better now then ever, n' vow to educating
The hood to good choices and getting a place in
Society with the things we facing, while they hating
We racing to like the masons all the way to the top
Cleaning up the game from the same damn thing
Cats faking and acting lame just to attract fame
But lyrically we react and blast them with words not gats
We (w)rap words around them like an island on a map
[removed]As I put on my fitted cap, I think about the music
And why we do it and how we do use it
To be a nuisance to the common mind
And it's time for the whole world to see me with a blinding shine[/removed]
And I'll never flop or fake with any of them props
Cuz I don't do it for nothing other then HIP HOP!

I didn't know why
You didn't show up sometimes
On Sunday mornings
And I missed you, but what we talked through
All them grown folk things, separation brings
You never let me know it, you never let it show
Because you loved me enormously
And so much more then to say
If you were with me today

Miscommunication leads to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you on every station
Some wan' play young lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from bricks to kingston
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run
Now understand ""l-boogie's"" non-violent
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun
Can't take a threat to mi new born son
L's been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you want to ball over separation
Tarnish my image in your conversation
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?
You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

Now, now how come your talk turn cold?
Gain the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
Now you all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless, now I'm more hopeful
Every man want to act like he's exempt
Need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always want to play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment
I know you don't want to hear my opinion
But there come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change then the rain soon come
See you might win some, but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done?  it's so silly how come?
You just lost one

Now don't you understand man universal law?
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard!
You can't hold god's people back that long
The chain of shatan wasn't made that strong
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now, some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely you'll see what you've become
Cause you might win some but you just lost one!

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done, it's so silly how come?

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done, it's so silly how come?

You just lost one

When the gun is tucked, untucked, nigga you dies
Like numchuks held by the Jet L-I

No two, no three, no four, know why?

Because one's four-five might blow yo' high
You ain't gotta go to church to get to know yo' God
It's a match made in heaven when I 'splay the 7
Put you on the nigga news, UPN at 11

Where you been, you ain't heard, got the word that I'm
That I'm so sin-surr?

That's why I stay fly and flying on shows
Car's are so cool, Aston no shoes
Just a rubber band on my wrist no jewels
I ain't gotta prove I'm rich, I'm no fool
I know the rules I ain't got time for it
But a nigga will shine when its time for it
And they will hate you deal with the real cake

Silent pardon, I hear you loud and clear
You left your finger print, you ain't gotta be there
I'm just waiting 'till you dig a hole big enough to put your whole body in

Please explain this shit to me, How is it logical?
Have we forgot our history? lets open our bibles
Its like the disciples dissing Jesus becoming his rivals
Shunning the one thing that they owe their life to
You let that man hype you to go against your idol
Knowing good and god damn well this what I do
Think I'm in the office I lost my grind
That's how kids become orphans, you lost your mind?
I keep my enemies close
I give 'em enough rope
They put themselves in the air

Who at his funeral left us with the words that
He did it his way
So I have no other choice but to do it my way

While niggas are shootin' stupid
I'm carefully plottin' ways to make it rotten
Well, planned hits until you're long forgotten
Y'all niggaz that utilize my style don't hurt me
'Cause on the low half of these rappin' ass niggaz wanna work for me
Now picture me standin' on somebody block tryin' to rock
I drop bombs and niggaz see me with that dough by eight o'clock
My feet never touch the concrete, just street sweep awards
While you're starin' on my dick nigga, gimme yours
I don't hassle with capsules, 'cause that'll make the grass grow
And get a project nigga paid up the asshole
If I'ma risk a frisk, gettin' my wrists wrapped up in steel
I'm out here tryin' to make a mill', my shit is real for real
While others worship guns I worship tons of money
Tons of fun, laughin' at shit that ain't even funny
So I ain't pressed to make a CD, I took it slow
Eighty percent of these niggaz with deals
Can't see me with the dough, uh

In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough

Recrutin', I'm hittin' shorties with consignment but don't play me
Oh, you gon' pay me, y'all niggaz ain't crazy
I'm laid back in the five thousand Italian leather seat recliner
Under some vagina, discussin' the finer, things
My crib is mean, watchin' a hundred inch screen
Lettin' the shorties slide by once in a while and let 'em dream
They think I've mastered the game, 'cause dames scream my name
With passion, I tell 'em stop flashin' and start stashin'
And we'll all get off the corner, the only heat you'll feel
Is from a sauna, lettin' bubbles shoot up your ass if you wanna
And fuck that weed, it keeps you broke, invest in
Pounds of herbs and profit if niggaz wanna smoke dope
But keep your nuts, 'cause this is a man's game
And we'll all pop champagne till it's a damn shame

Schoolin' the dice like Vinny Barberino
Welcome back, the '95 version of the mack
As soon as these ladies see me they don't know how to act
'Cause like that, nigga, never twist the cap of malt liquor
Only pop and droppin' Cristal's down my throat, take a swigga
My style, ladies intoxicated by my profile
You're rollin' with a pro with, money to blow child
You need to feel how sweet the skills be
To come and slide down Sugar Hill with me
The high roller, rolled up on your dice game
Unfold a pack of bills, grab my balls then bet it all
I never slept, 'cause sleepin' keeps you deep in debt
On the block you lucky if you see my silhouette
I'm ghost, envied by most
So I keep a crew of crazy tenants that's sling toast, fucker

Gettin' men lynched, too intense, I'm killin' infants for ten cents
Cause I'm a street genius with a unique penis
Got fly chicks on my dick that don't even speak English
I'm makin' ducks shed much tears, I buck queers
I don't have it all upstairs but who the fuck cares?
I'm grabbin' brews takin' fast swiggas
I get cash and stash figures and harass them bitch ass niggas
After you your man'll get scarred next
And if your squad flex I'm lettin' off like Bernard Goetz
A Tec-9 is my utensil
Fillin' niggas with so much lead they can use they dick for a pencil
I'm known for snatchin' purses and bombin' churches
I get more pussy by accident than most niggas get on purpose
I got drug spots from New York to Canada
Cause Big L be fuckin' with more keys than a janitor

Yo I got a death wish
That's why I talk so much fuckin' shit
I want these bitch motherfuckers to try to flip
So I can fill up this clip
And stick the gun between they lips like a cigarette
And let 'em smoke the four fifth
Ah fool, ah goodbye no need to try to lie or cry
It's time for motherfuckers to die
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards I'd be missing a whole deck
Strap up a Mac clack clack motherfuckers are runnin' like rats
The blind bats are fuckin' crazed cats
Cause the Microphone Nut's loose
And you're wonderin' how the fuck did this madman get cut loose
From 25 consecutive 25 to life bids
For murderin' up some fuckin' white kids
These were the kids of the prison guards
Then I startin' killin' squads of prison guards in the prison yard
One two everybody's through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm back to haunt shit and talk shit
Whoever flaunt shit I leave 'em unconscious
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Wreck like Das EFX straight out the fuckin' sewer
Please show me where the crack is at
While they quarter crack the sack I crack they backs like Cracker Jacks
So I'm the one you should run from
Because the Microphone Nut is like a motherfuckin' stun gun

The way I rock no way you could stop
I shock pop and drop when Jay gets hot
When I'm in the zone better hold ya own
Cause I like to break when I finish a poem
Pound for p-p-pound the best around
No way you can get up when I get down

And beat a nigga ass half silly on the one

Jay-Z,"I keep it fresher than the next bitch
No need for you to ever sweat the next bitch
With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit
Indeed, you gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me
You get the keys to the Lexus, with no driver
You got your own '96 suh-in the ride
And keep your ass tighter than Versace that's why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me
They conniving shit
The first chance to crack the bank
They try me, all they get is 50 cent franks
And papayas, from the village to the tele
Time to kill it on your belly no question
I got more black chicks between my sheets than Essence
They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less than 8 seconds
Still poundin' in my after life
Laugin' my shit is tight
You who askin' right

Ain't no nigga like the one I got
No one can fuck you betta'
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
Keeps you in diamonds and leathers
Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone
Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah ha
Tell the freaks to find a man of their own
(Man of they own, man of they own)

Fresh to def in Moschino, coach bag
Lookin' half black and Filipino fakin' no jacks
Got you a beeper to feel important
Surrounding your feet in Joanie Degas and Charles Jordan
I keep ya dove but love
You know these hoes be makin' me weak
Y'all knows how it goes B and so I creep
I've been sinnin' since you been playin' wit Barbie and Ken and
You can't change a players game in the 9th inning
The chrome rim spinning keeps 'em grinnin'
So I run way the fuck up in 'em
And wrinkle the face like linnin'
I play hardah till they say God
He's keepin' it real jigga stay hard
Lord don't even trip
I never slip, nigga what you don't see is what'cha get
Weapons concealed what the fuck y'all feel
When you nigga play sick we can all get ill
Whats the deal?

Yo, ain't no stoppin' this, no lie
Promise to stay monogamous, I try
But love you know these hoes be makin' me weak
Y'all knows how it goes B, so I stay deep

What up boo, just keep me laced in the illa snakes
Bank rolls and shit, back rubs in the French tubs
Mackin' this bitch, wifey nigga
So when you flip that coke
Remember them days you was dead broke
But now your style and I raised you
Basically made you into a don
Flippin' weight, heroin and shit
You know my pussy is all that
Thats why I get begets 5 carats and all that
From Dolce Gabana to H Vendell I'm ringin' bells
So who the player? I still keep you in the illest gators
Tailor made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscin'
On how I fuck the best a shit
Specially when I'm flippin' Baileys
Don't give a fuck about how you move with them other mami's
I push the Z, eating shrimp scampi with rocks larger than life
Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was
I got you frontin' in Armani sweaters
Before this rap shit
When you was in letters and bullshit berettas
And eek classes with mo in the glasses
Shows in Cali wit all the flavor suede Bally's
Now all your mens' up in your Benz's
High post, I swear you be killin' me
Playin' inside my pubic hairs
I never worry bout them other chicks
Cause you proved who was your wiz
When you was spinnin' that bitch
I took a little when you was up north
Your commissary stay pilin'
How you livin' large on the island
All them collects have me vexed
But when you come home
Knew I was comin' off wit half of dem checks
Now we on the rise
Your diamond mami wit the slanted eyes
Holdin' this grip cocked the green and the shit
Fuck's no, I see half the dough
Made you into a star, pushin' hundred thousand dollar cars

Ain't no nigga like the one I got
No one can fuck you betta'
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
Keeps you in diamonds and leathers
Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone

Jay-Z,"Aiyyo Jay word up; these motherfuckers
Fuckin' talkin' that comeback shit like they cookin' crack
Shit I ain't frontin' all I want my pockets green like slum change
Yaknahmsayin? Front the roll we roll back like rubbers motherfucker
For real; with no trace of AIDS
We keep our pockets fully blown, Roc-A-Fella click nigga

Aiyyo we pattin down pussy from Sugarhill to the Shark Bar
Fuck a bitch D in the marked car
We got the bad bitches gaspin' for air in Aspen
Searchin' for aspirin when I ask then, we swing
You cling we do our thing and bring
Sling your ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy Brooklyn to Beijing
East coast hostess hostile colossal, money flarin'
Like nostrils for drug dealin' apostles, huh
Al Pacino down to Nino Brown
Me Jay and Primo, got it sewed across the board like poquino
Teflon, make sure your jammy is full
Cause I heard, Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull
Tropical leaves where I got a few keys
With my man I'll stock a few G's, now it's unstoppable cheese
Said we was garbage, so fuck college
Street knowledge amazin' to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars
Star studded bitches with crystals, get fucked with pistols
Just to see my shit, discharge puss
I drop the stellar, even acapella
I got to tell all about Roc-A-Fella

Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thang

Mannerisms of a young Bobby DeNiro, spent Spanish wisdoms
In a whip with dinero, crime organized like the pharaoh
I cream, I diamond gleam
High post like Hakeem, got a lot of things to drop
Brooklyn to Queens, I gotta keep my steam
Niggaz wanna try to hem my long jeans
Uptown fiend for Jay-Z to appear on the scene
In the meanwhile, here's somethin dope for y'all to lean
Liaison for days on in
Money make the world go around so I made songs to spin
Can I Live, did dough, with my nigs, dividends flow
Like the Mississippi riv', lookin jig'
Can't do for dolo, had to turn away when Tony killed Manolo
That's real, mixed feelings like a mulatto
Thug thought he was O.G. Bobby Johnson
I played him like Benny Blanco, mano a mano
You ain't ready, I find no trigger straight up shoot my guns
Horizontal, get your weight up, I am
Two point two pounds you're barely a hundred and twenty-five grams
Wouldn't expect y'all to understand this money
Do the knowledge, do the few dollars, I'm due to demolish
Crews Brooklyn through Hollis to a hood near you, what the fuck...

(""Bring it on if you think you can hang..."")

Money is power
I'm into cheddick with facial credit
Pure platinum fetish for cheddars
Spread letters you move you're deadish
I make moves that remove pebbles out of shoes
You suck pistol like pipe with the crystal
John Stockton couldn't assist you
Cowboys or Benzes like we foulin in the U.N.
So what the fuck you doin?
Whatever nigga Fahrvegnugen, rugged yet polished
Spankin dollars with the commas
Bangin bitches out the Bahamas
On hides of llama we cry nada, fly frather
Fry hotter, you die gotta
Fuck with me witness manana
Absence of malice in my palace
Call cousin now Dallas trigger finger with the callous
Tip scales from mail to keep these niggaz off balance
Your frequent stops to O.T.B. you feedin me
Steam a nigga schemin on the wrist action with the gleams
Jewels for Pop Duke fulfill your dreams
Never put the pure brown sugar before the dirty green cream

Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thang
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang

But on the contrilli, I packs the mack-milli
Squeezed off on him, left them paramedics breathing soft on him

We invite you to, something epic y'all know?
Well we hustle out of a sense of, hopelessness
Sort of a desperation
Through that desperation, we 'come addicted
Sorta like the fiends we accustomed to serving
But we feel we have nothing to lose
So we offer you, well, we offer our lives, right
What do you bring to the table?

While I'm watching every nigga watching me closely
My shit is butter for the bread they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked then clap from closed feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
A brother gotta admire from four fiends away
My pain wish it was quick to see, from selling 'caine
Til brains was fried to a fricassee, can't lie
At the time it never bothered me, at the bar
Getting my thug on properly, my squad and me
Lack of respect for authority, laughing hard
Happy to be escaping poverty, however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks, expectation
For dips, four percent pertation we stack chips, hardly
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in
No more, Big Willie my game has grown prefer you call me William
Illin' for revenues, grateful dim the light
Channel 7 news, round seven jewels, hand getting the mic
Forgetting all I ever knew, convenient amnesia
I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure
Lock my body can't trap my mind, easily
Explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant that's how we on it
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speaking in codes since I sense you peeking
The INXS rental, don't be fooled my game is mental
We both out of town dog, what you trying to get into?
Viva, Las Vegas, see ya, later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no fraud Willie's present gambling they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time, sipping margaritas
Yeah, can I live?
Can I live?

My mind is infested, with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes, in unity, my crew and me
Commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it, manifest it in tangible goods
Platinum Rolexed it, we don't lease
We buy the whole care, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation, EXPLODE
On detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it balls to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends gotta do it, even righteous minds go through this
True this, history school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and, watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous, dreams of
Getting cream let's do this, against T-D-S
So I keep one eye open like, C-B-S, ya see me

Yo, yo, yo, I blacks out, I pulls the mack out
Scream ""what's that about,"" then I clap out
I get my plot on, in my drop on
Through the rotten, don't even hate on those who hate me
I got popped on, feelin' it (feelin' it)
Chickens are ice grillin' it
Cops pullin' it over, Jigga react militant
Speed off, officer told me to turn the beat off
I turned it a level higher, then return the devils fire
I'm raised different, reactin' situations
Niggas lay stiff and, rookies blame it on the age difference
My subliminal flows create criminal O's
Sing along if you with me, til the end of the road
I'm cynical when in the view of the public
And this is because, I'm defensive when I'm in interviews
The percentage who don't understand is higher than the percentage who do
Check yourself, what percentage is you?

Can I live
For all my niggas with all white air force ones and black guns, stack ones yo

For all my chicks, pigeons, hoes stand bow legged like the bulldog, know what

I got the feds sending me letters 'cause I'm schooling the youth
But they can't lock me down 'cause my tool is the truth
Yeah I sold drugs for a living, that's a given
Why is it? why don't y'all try to visit the neighborhoods I lived in
My mind been through hell, my neighborhood is crime central
Where cops lock you more than try to defend you
I push you to the limit when I'm needing the wealth
And all I see is life cycle just repeatin' itself
Ran into shorty boppin' down the ave
On his way to clockin' mad then
He proceeded to show me a block of slab and said

Hey yo there's money I there I just gotta have
When I catch up to these feinds I'm'a knock 'em on they ass
Not to brag, sometimes I look at life and laugh
How I think about school and it taught me not a ?
When I backed out, let one one, let the barrel turn
Holla at you fagots that its my block to burn
That credit you dead it, I know heads gettin' annoyed and knew all
About a dope feind before reading Donald goings
Flipping boying, using the right cut
One thing that's fucked up is bad dope that I can't pump
This slab gotta re-up and re-bag, blend it in with the raw
Bubble it fast cop more, once I get it I got it I lock it
Nobody pop shit, selling twenties on my block bitch
For some blacktop shit
What you want nigga, what you want nigga
What you want, what you want nigga

Tryin' to win in the construction Timbs yo
Can I live,

Like a hymen, when I'm rhymin with remarkable timing
Caviar and silk dreams, my voice is linen
Spittin venom up in the, minds of young women
Mink thoughts to think thoughts type similar
Might you remember, my shit is cold like December
Smoother than Persian rugs, the cashmere
Chromosomes make a nigga Jigga Jay-Z lethal drugs
Eighteen carat gold pen, when it hits the sheets
Words worth a million like I'm rapping em through platinum teeth
I got the Grey Poupon, you been warned
Cause all beef return well done fillet Mignon
The Don, smell of Dom on my breath as I
Yawn, (slow) when you hoes try to con a pro
As if you didn't know, Jay's about getting dough
Spitting flow like fine wines down your earlobe
I'm smooth but deadly like a pearl handled pistol
Honies hum in melody when I, rub it like crystal
The proper etiquette, when I drop the subject verb
Then the predicate, with this rich nigga preterit
I'm solid gold, I rap like a mink stole
I stick pearl tongues your world'll never know
From New York, to Paris, the vocal style vary
From nice to deadly like a bad bag of D, now
Notice, the child swift like a locust
Focus on the loc' I be the greatest nigga that wrote it
Return of the Jedi, from Rio Degenero
Worn da red eye, yet I, still feel the need to be fly
I did die when I'm rapping then slide like satin
You know the black eye white china in the brain cabinet
I never cry if I did I'd cry ice
From my nigga Sauce, I hit you with this advice
Life's short, so play hard and stick hard
And the only time you love em is when your dick hard

Doin your best Jay-Z rendition
Too many rough motherfuckers, I got my suspicions
That you're just a fish in a pool of sharks nigga, listen
Too many bitches wanna be ladies, so if you a hoe
I'ma call you a hoe, too many bitches are shady
Too many ladies give these niggaz too many chances
Too many brothers wannabe lovers don't know what romance is
Too many bitches stuck up from too many sexual advances
No question; Jay-Z got too many answers
I been around this block, too many times
Rocked, too many rhymes, cocked, too many nines, too
To all my brothers it ain't too late to come together
Cause too much black and too much love, equal forever
I don't follow any guidelines cause too many niggaz ride mine
So I change styles every two rhymes, hah, what the fuck
That's twenty two too's for y'all motherfuckers out there, yaknahmean?
Shall I continue?  Check it out, what?

Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Well I'm gone, yo, yo, yo
Copped to reach my quota, push rock, roll up smooth like on ya
Whole groove like hold-up, swoll up
Too many faggot niggaz, clockin' my spendin'
Exercisin' you're, gay like minds like Richard Simmons
If you could catch Jay right, on the late night
Without the eight right, maybe you could test my weight, right
I dip, speak quicker than you ever seen
Administer pain, next the minister's screamin' your name
At your wake as I peak in, look in your casket
Feelin' sarcastic, ""Look at him, still sleepin'""
You never ready, forever petty minds stay petty
Mines thinkin' longevity until I'm seventy
Livin' heavenly, fuck, felony after felony, what?
Nigga ya broke, what the fuck you gon' tell me?

(""Oh!"")

Jay-Z, Jay-Z, now you know this is a fat track (aight)
Now this is comin' on your new album, on Roc-A-Fella records in ninety-six
(no doubt no doubt) well, it is definitely the bomb
But you know I do wanna say somethin' to you, I know
You've been havin' a lot of problems with the law
But I know you innocent, and I'm behind you 100%
Mad Wednesday's, Ruby King, DJ Ace, Dang Dash
Roc-A-Fella Records, we all behind you, you can come back anytime
(Hah, thanks a lot)
Wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute
Ace, turn that music down
I smell some reefer, now you see?
That's why, our people don't have anything
Because we don't know how to go in places and act properly
(""Hey shut the fuck up!"")
Wait a minute wait a minute who told me shut the eff up?
Who told me to shut the eff up?  Get him out of here
I'm not gonna continue this show, until you throw him out
Get him out right now, then I'ma continue my speech
Thank you, he's out of here now, now like I was sayin'
We gotta build our own business, we gotta get our own

Jay-Z,"Ah shit, okay, okay, alright
Big man! You wanna make some big bucks, huh?
Let's see how tough you are
You know something about cocaine? Digame!
You kidding me or what man?
There's a bunch of Colombians coming in Friday, new guys
They said they got two keys for us, openers
Pure cocaine, you tell 'em, capiche?
I want you to go over there
And if it's what they say it is, you buy it, you bring it back
You can do that you make five grand
Meet them at the Bodegas, noon Friday
You get the buy money then
Oh and chico, if anything happens to the buy money

Yo, I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to free a Big Willie
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Shopping sprees, cop in three
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah, yes
Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 Gs to the crap shooter, niggas can't fade me
Chrome socks beaming
Through my peripheral I see you scheming
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Niggas is fiending, what's the meaning
I'm leaning on any nigga intervening
With the sound of my money machining
My cup runneth over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it, six digits and running

('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star

Last seen out of state where I drop my sling
I'm deep in the South kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway switching fo' lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thang
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
Why play with fire, burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
'Til legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
What y'all don't know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause you can't knock the hustle

But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel ('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
The way you make me feel
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real

Yo, y'all niggas lunching, punching the clock
My function is to make much and lay back munching
Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew something to watch
Nothing to stop, unstoppable
Scheme on the ice, I gotta hot your crew
I gotta, let you niggas know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle
It's a damn shame what you're not though: (who?) me
Slick like a gato, fucking Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
Straight bananas; can a nigga see me
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son you're too eager
You ain't having it, good me either
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us, huh
At my arraignment screaming
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
Thieving, as long as I'm breathing
Can't knock the way a nigga eating, fuck you even!

Come experience... life as we know it
As some of you should know it, yeah, yeah
Place, Marcy, Brooklyn
Actions... well, y'all know the actions

Uhh, I got this shorty on my block always clockin my rocks
He likes the style and profile I think he wanna mock
He likes the way I walk, he sees my money talkin
to honies hawkin I'm the hottest nigga in New York and
I see his hunger pains, I know his blood boils
He wanna, run with me, I know this kid'll be loyal
I watched him make a few ends, to cop his little sneakers and gear
then it's just enough for re-up again
I see myself in his eyes, I moved from Levi's
to Guess to Versace, now it's diamonds like Liberace
That's just the natural cycle, nobody wanna be like Michael
where I'm from, just them niggaz who bounce from a gun
We out here trying to make hard white into cohhhhld green
I can help shorty blow out like Afro-Sheen
Plus I can relive my days of youth which is gone
That little nigga's peeps, it's time to put him on

It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)

I'm out here slingin bringin the drama, tryin to come up
in the game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name
I'm out here servin disturbin the peace, life could be better
like my man reclined in plush leather seats
He's sellin weight, I'm sellin eight... balls
sixteen tryin to graduate to pushin quarters y'all
I ain't gon' sweat him I'ma let him come to me
If he give me the nod then these niggaz gon' see
I'm tired of bein out here round the clock
and breakin day, and chasin crackers up the block for my pay
I'm stayin fresh, so chickens check
I'm tryin to step up to the next level, pushin Vettes to the Jets
Diamonds reflect from the sun, directly in your equilibirum
and stunned I'm waitin for my day to come
I got the urge, to splurge, I don't wanna lifetime sentence
just give me the word

On the low?
Yeah, the only way to blow
You let your shit bubble quietly
AND THEN YOU BLOW!
Hey keep your cool
The only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand
Then you play your cards

Jay-Z,"This shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak
We're all trying to win, but then again
Maybe it's for the best though, 'cause when they're seeing too much
You know they're trying to get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out couldn't understand the mechanics
And the workings of the underworld, granted
Nine to five is how to survive, I ain't trying to survive
I'm trying to live it to the limit and love it a lot
Life ills, poison my body
I used to say 'fuck mic skills,' and never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti
That's right it's wicked, that's life I live it
Ain't asking for forgiveness for my sins, endz
I break bread with the late heads, picking their brains for angles on
all the evils that the game'll do
It gets dangerous, money and power is changing us
And now we're lethal, infected with D'Evils

We used to fight for building blocks
Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killing
The closest of friends when we first started
But grew apart as the money grew, and soon grew black-hearted
Thinking back when we first learned to use rubbers
He never learned so in turn I'm kidnapping his baby's mother
My hand around her collar, feeding her cheese
She said the taste of dollars was shitty so I fed her fifties
About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced
So I kept feeding her money 'til her shit started to make sense
Who could ever foresee, we used to stay up all night at slumber parties
now I'm trying to rock this bitch to sleep
All the years we were real close
Now I see his fears through her tears, know she's wishing we were still close
Don't cry, it is the (beat?)
In time, I'll take away your miseries and make 'em mine, D'Evils

My flesh, no nigga could test
My soul is possessed by D'Evils in the form of diamonds and Lexus's
The exorcist, got me doing skits like Homie
You don't know me, but the whole world owe me strip!
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life
So now I'm down for whatever, ain't nothing nice
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me
Liquors invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off, mama forgive me
I can't be held accountable, D'Evils beating me down, boo
Got me running with guys, making G's, telling lies that sound true
Come test me, I never cower
For the love of money, son, I'm giving lead showers
Stop screaming, you know the demon said it's best to die
And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'Evils",D'evils,1996
Jay-Z,"Presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me

While others spit that Wonderama shit, me and my conglomerate
Shall remain anonymous, caught up in the finest shit
Live out my dreams until my heart give out
Involved with cream, you know exactly what this shit's about
Fuck y'all mean? Handling since a teen, I dish out
Like the point guard off your favorite team, without doubt
My life ain't rosy but I roll with it
My mind was fine 'til the dough hit it and told me that the Mo' did it
And now it's kosher, shit is so Hasidic
I blow a digit on a diamond in a minute but no bitches
Watch how I'm walking cause even the thoroughest niggas be narkin'
Tryin' to strike a bargain hoping that they might get pardoned
Shit I'm involved with got me pins and needles
And my cerebral breeds the wickedest evil thoughts that this sport'll feed you
Peep facts, in the game so deep fiends could catch ya
Freeze off my knee cap, can y'all believe that?
Got the city drinking Cristals, re-up the fee
Rappers going broke, tryin' to keep up with me
My rise to riches surprised the bitches: think harder
You know this nigga, Jay-Z, Shawn Carter
G.S. the fuck up, dress the fuck up
Watch me shine like a Breitling, begets the fuck up
All rhymers forget it like Alzheimer's
Small timers, I said it, I'm addressing all dramas
Talk to me

Presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me

So sick of niggas, ""I want money like Cosby"" (who wouldn't?)
This the kinda talk that make me think you probably ain't got no pudding
Niggas got them kinda dreams from Jay
You in the streets, nigga, make your moves, get your mill
Niggas'll coast in the SL but can't post bail
Niggas'll roast a L but scared to throw your toast, well
I'm here to tell niggas it ain't all swell
There's heaven, then there's hell niggas
One day you're cruising in your 7, next day you're sweating, forgetting your lies
Alibis ain't matching up, bullshit catching up
Hit with the RICO, they repo your vehicle
Everything was all good just a week ago
'Bout to start bitching ain't you? Ready to start snitching ain't you?
I'll forgive your weak ass; hustling just ain't you
Aside from the fast cars, honeys that shake they ass at bars
You know you wouldn't be involved
With the underworld dealers, carriers of mac-millers
East Coast bodiers, West Coast cap-peelers
Little monkey niggas turn gorillas
Stopped at the station, filled up on octane
And now they not sane and not playing, that goes without saying
Slaying day in and day out with money playing, then they play you out
Trying to escape my own mind, lurking the enemy
Representing infinity with presidencies, you know?

No waiting I'll make your block infrared hot I'm like Satan
Y'all feel a nigga's struggle, y'all think a nigga love to
Hustle behind the wheel, trying to escape my trouble
Kids stop they greeting me, I'm talking sweet to keys
Cursing the very God, that bought this wreath to be
My life is, based on sacrifices, jewels like ices
And fools that think I slip, you fuck around
You get your guys hit, they built me to be filthy
On some I-do-or-die shit, for real
The price of leather's got me, deeper than ever and
Just think, with this here, I'm trying to feel made nigga

Politics as usual, I took my
Frito to Tito in the district, blessed me with some
VS somethings I can live with, stop fronting
And for the dough I raise, gotta get shit appraised
No disrespect to you, make sure you word is true
I'm taking wages down in Vegas just in case Tyson
Have a major night off, that's clean money, the tax write-off
You ain't seen money in your life, when it
Comes to this cheese y'all like Three Blind Mice
A smoking bro, who pump Willie Ike spokes
The furthest you Chiles been is the Pocanos
My portfolio reads, leads to Don Corleone, nigga please
Ten year feleon, heavy on the wrist, our face used
With the diamond blooded Jesus and blind your face
Youse for life, sharight, Jigga, I keep it tight nigga

You feel my triumph never, feel my pain I'm lyin
Low in the leather Zion, the best that's ever came
The game changes like, my mind just ain't right
We 'gwan get this dough, I guess it ain't your night
Sucking me in like a vacuum, I remember
Telling my family I'll be back soon, that was December
Eighty-five and, Jay-Z rise ten years later
Got me wise still can't break my underworld ties
I wear black a lot, in the Ac', act a lot
Got matching VCR's, a huge Magnavox
To nitch, green like spinach pop wines that's vintage
It's a lot of big money in my sentence
Hitting towards a mil', lip a, written I kill like that
Chick faked me one-two cat, yeah, I do that
Ain't no stopping the champagne from popping
The drawers from dropping, the law from watching, I hate 'em

Jay-Z,"Stress
Sunshine, geyeah

I sold it all from crack to o-pium, in third person
I don't wanna see em, so I'm rehearsing
with my peoples high to GM, from a remote lo-cation
in the BM, scoping the whole situation like, ""Dayamm!""
Metamorphic, as the dope turns to cre-am
but one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean
It's difficult to read em, the windows to his soul
are half closed, I put the key in
Pulled off slow, hoping my people flee-in
Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in
Coppers was watching us through nighttime binoculars
This time they got us on tape, exchanging dope for dollars
Make me wanna, holler back at the crib in the sauna
Praying my people bailed out like Time/Warner
Awaiting call, from his kin not the coroner
Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner
Beads of sweat second thoughts on my mind
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets
This time, stress, giving this shit up, fuck

This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the, rise to the top, many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
And through our travels we get separated, never forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

As sure as this, Earth is turning souls burning
in search of higher learning turning in every direction seeking direction
My moms crying cause her insides are dyin'
her son trying her patience, keep her heart racin'
A million beats a minute, I know I push you to your limit
but it's this game love, I'm caught up all in it
They make it so you can't prevent it, never give it
you gotta take it, can't fake it I keep it authentic
My hand got this pistol shaking, cause I sense danger
like Camp Crystal Lake and
don't wanna shoot him, but I got him, trapped
within this infrared dot, bout to hot him and, hit rock bottom
No answers to these trick questions, no time shit stressing
My life found I got ta live for the right now
Time waits for no man, can't turn back the hands
once it's too late, gotta learn to live with regrets

You used to hold me, told me that I was the best
Anything in this world I want I could possess
All that made me want is all that I could get
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets (when I was young)
You used to hold me, told me that I was the best
Anything in this world I want I could possess
All that made me want is all that I could get
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets (when I was young)

I found myself reminiscing, remember this one
when he was here he was crazy nice with his son
I miss him, long as I'm living he's living through memories
He's there to kill all my suicidal tendencies
In heaven looking over me, or in hell, keeping it cozy
I'm coming life on these streets ain't what it's supposed to be
Remember Newton, mutual friend well me and him feuding
On your life I tried to talk to him
But you know niggaz, think they guns can stop foe niggas
Fronting like they're, Big Willie but really old niggas
Hoe niggas, this year I'm sho' niggas think I'm slipping
I'm bought to send you a roommate, no bullshitting
for my hustle's going too well to hit him
You was right niggas want you to be miserable wit em
Anyway, I ain't trying to hear it, I think I'm touched
this whole verse I been talking to your spirit, a little too much

This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the, rise to the top, many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
And through our travels we get separated, never forget

Ah, who wanna bet us that we don't touch leathers
Stack cheddars forever, live treacherous all the et ceteras
To the death of us, me and my confidants, we shine
You feel the ambiance, y'all niggas just rhyme
By the ounce dough accumulates like snow
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, you feel me?
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill three quarts of my blood into the street, let alone the heat
Fuck em, we hate a nigga lovin' this life
In all possible ways, know the Feds is buggin' my life
Hospital days, reflectin' when my man laid up
On the Uptown high block he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slippin', this is a minor set back
Yo, still in all we livin', just dream about the get back
That made him smile though his eyes said, ""Pray for me""
I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process
And I ain't got nothin' but time
I had near brushes, not to mention three shots
Close range, never touched me, divine intervention
Can't stop I, from drinkin' Mai-Tai's, with Ty Ty
Down in Nevada, ha ha, Poppa, word life
I dabbled in crazy weight without rap, I was crazy straight
Partner, I'm still spendin' money from eighty-eight what?

Geyeah, know what? I'll make..
You and your wack mans fold like bad hands
Roll like Monopoly, ad-vance you copy me
Like white crystals, I gross the most
At the end of the fiscal year than these niggas can wish to
The dead presidential, canidate
With the sprinkles and the presidential, ice that'll offend you
In due time when crime fleas my mind
All sneak thieves and playa haters can shine
But until then I keep the trillion cut diamonds shinin' brilliant
I'll tell you half the story, the rest you fill it in
Long as the villain win
I spend Japan yen, attend major events
Catch me in the joints, convinced my iguanas is bitin'
J-A-Y hyphen, controllin', manipulatin'
I got a good life man, pounds and pence

Catch me swinging for the fence

Pay five dead it from blow, better believe I have
Eleven sixty to show, my doe flip like Tae-Kwon

All of my rhymes fall all of my days I trade
All of my dimes and all of my bad ways I fade
Killing late nights cruisin'
All you see is the break lights
And hair blowing you know where we going
Or at the club in the rear frontin'
Poppin droppin'
The amounts of cats but we ain't trying to hear nothing
Probably was wilder than wobbly are you the wiggy to give me
Hold me down and make me slow down to be twissy
Keep the ice out the club life - change face
Get on love wife while he on the license plates
Wait - make me think about you even when your not around
Use the bathroom put the toilet seat back down
Got me some sprinkles the hair with the wrinkles
If preferred his and her furs to the ankles
Keep your friends buggin' lovin' all my ways
Jigga keep me jiggy all of my days

In the middle of the night
Got me thinkin' bout cha babe
Got me dreamin' about cha baby

Keep it on the low are Kelly style it's quite shockin'
A year ago all I did was spend nights hoppin'
In the club in search of pretty faces and night stalkers
Who would have thought I'd walk down the aisle
Rice droppin' got you a nice rock and
Now it's on and poppin' droppin' holiday platinum bracelets
Jigga - are Kelly - Changing Faces

All I want is to be with you all of my days

Exuberant, change, cross, exhilarated 
Flamboyant, but bouncy on beat breaks, I'm animated 
Now it's been stated, I'm lyrically enthusiastic 
I'm dope like all east coast CD's wrapped through plastic 
What's the meaning of life, y'all should know 
In my lifetime I need a whole lotta dough, bro 
No need to get zealous, you jealous, say you jealous 
I spike on that like Monica Seles 
I split a divine rhyme, exquisite like some elegant wine 
Here's a toast, the world is mine 
I promise I'm a keep it punk 
I represent the real hip-hop, I ain't no freakin' country bumpkin 
Hooparistic, freakaristic, poetic frenzy with conception 
I got more flavor than a mystic 
Fringe benefitic, urging y'all to get wit it 
Style postulates, now pause while you gets splitted 
I'm not just taco, I'm the whole enchilado 
Enter any center blowin' up like Desperado

L.A. to Bronx to Bekailen 
Together we provide a ton of better on the way and 
We rhyme related 
Very under-estimated, that's why I'm winnin' 
In this world of sins, steady grinning, money boss spendin' 
Distanced from dirty women, Lord, I'm quite influential 
Spiritually and mental, what you into I'd a been through 
Preachin' my words and don't know it, you owe it 
It shows you want to be me but won't show it 
Ain't nothin' changed but the playas 
The game remains the same 
I had a ten year run, hey, I can't complain 
Took the next step see, from Coke to Pepsi 
From the B.X., we ridin' to South Beach on jet ski 
Play to survive, you ain't live, you just livin' 
You breathin' a good one, but where I'm from y'all forbidden 
Come around, bad decision, you'd rather be in prison 
Ain't no duckin' when I'm delivering, won't be forgiver-in' 
Layin' there shiverin, half the night 
You gotta walk towards the light, everything is aight 
Make sure, everything you endure stays tight

We stepped it up, y'all don't ever want to showdown 
Get wetted up by the sleeve that leave the bets wild 
Y'all don't like it, sue me 
Got settled out 
Ghettoed out, in the vehicle bent 
These days I mellowed out 
See, success make a fella content

I know you rappers want to see me fail 
But quick to see a six-hundred S.L. B-12

Triple platnum nigga with the solid gold fade
All that nickle and dime shit, don't hold no weight
Fortune 5, top 5 in the Forbes (you'll see) as you
Thumb through the Source I read the Ride report
Class C, cold me down with the plastic
That's all I Ask Of You, like Raphael Saadiq
At the hotel, Nico, robbin' the val suite
My people's eyes through the peep hole
I'm lovin' you down freak as I
Shoot through the city like a rumor
Not soon enough, to stop 'em from spreadin' the news
Paper headin' read ""Jay-Z breaths, 80 degrees""
the only thing to cool them off is a Malibu day breeze
Can't sop for the feds, say cheese
You know they wanna take a nigga picture 
Pray for the day to get ya, but I'm a parlay and stay richer for now
Jigga hasn't done dirt in a while
You know my stomach getin' weak from livin' on the streets for real
Tryin' to oversee it from suites, orderin' eats
At the top where the criminal minds meet
That's where the cream is (right) , that's where your dream is (well ain't it?)

You're only a customer (uh)
Walkin' in the presence of hustlers 
You spend money all night long
""All night long"" 

A-yo my youth had a nigga too aggressive
I use to speed excessive, both eyes closed
No thought infested
Hittin' pot holes, cop-o's will snatch your weight
But your game most precious
Had to rethink things, is pinky ring worth
Life on the run and time served in Sing Sing
I don't know to tell the truth
If I'm pressed for doe, I got to consoul Irv Gotti y'all

Heads got to roll

I was raised to live, Lord I pray you forgive
If not, I just handle it like Jason Kidd
What you're facin' is official (it's official)
Most cases when I""m blazin' won't miss you (won't miss you)
Case and point mad bullshitted issue
I see it to the end, my writting is so personal
My heart bleedin' out my pen, make no mistake aobut me
It's only one nigga livin', I got a half a cake about me
I got love, to make a nigga die bleedin' is nothin'
You make a motherfucker die breathin' then you sayin' somthing, beeotch

More flavor than y'all can image havin' 
Graphic like Sega, Saturn, traffic like the Bodega
It just so happens, you caught me at the the tail end of my dive
My brain ain't right from inhaling the work of my life
Fuck it, 3's in ya, had to hold
D.C. high pissy off Cristle
3 G's high seasoned Bacardy, UV's 
Blesses my body, we be fresh at the party 
Play yourself go head if you don't no the ledge
It's like spittin' to God
Get it in your face fuckin' with niggas over your head
Take your time with me, shiftee 
Use to make Coke stretch like the samplin' a 950
Shit with that, while I'm o a Kawasoki bike
At the light, doin' a pike, with a bitch on the back
And take flight, my life like it was directed by Hype
In 35 slow-mo, with the Rockafella logo
Accapoco to Arruba, bay breezes and caviar baluga
Very little loot, a loser
In the grashish blueish, Les Coup it's the root of evil in these people

Those dreams you say you got give me the chills
But these mils make me hot y'all feel me
Enough to stop the illin right?
But at the same time these dimes keep me feelin tight 
I'm so confused
OK I'm gettin weeded now I know I'm contradicting myself
Look I don't need that now 
It just once in a blue moon when there's nothin to do and
The tension's too thick for my sober mind to cut through

I'm sending niggas back up in campuses
Chance is slimmer than that chick in Calvin Klein pants
Let me guess, they said it was money round here
And the rest is me stopping you from getting it, correct?
Sorry to hear that, my guess is you got work at the hotel
I'll take care of that, you'll see, now please
Give me the room key
You're twitching, don't do that, you making me nervous
My crew, well, they do pack, them niggas is murderous
So would ya, please put your hand back in sight
They don't like to see me nervous you can understand that, right?
You draw, better be Picasso, y'know the best
Cause if this is not so, ah, god bless
You leave me no choice, I leave you no voice
Believe me son I hate to do it just as bad as you hate to see it done
Now calm your boys

Why wouldn't she cheat on you 
Why wouldn't she cheat on you 
If she got with you when she already had a man 
Why wouldn't she cheat on you

See it's all good, and it's all sweet 
All women flirt, all women cheat 
So I might spend a week down in Virginia Beach 
Out of inner sheets blaze plenty freaks 
Be the bad boy everybody want to meet 
Practice what I preach, never caught when I cheat 
If I didn't work late, I say I was wit my peeps 
And quick to tell a hoe, yo I didn't get the beep 
And all these girls is quite the same 
So it ain't your pencil, it's how you write your name

Ain't nobody hotter than the jam, don dada

39 in my Benz them niggaz and super size them 
Girl talk slick but I see through the lies 
You don't got TV, whatcha mean who am I

If you know that she cheat why you live with the girl 
Have your cats come live in my world 
Cause you couldn't picture another nigga hittin your girl

Nice is lawless, recite for ballest 
And I fools y'all fake players every time 
Cause you only hit chicks that you think is mine 
You know I paid his due, but I'm unfatable 
Mommi screamin pappi can I skate wit you 
They want to ride wit me, stay fly wit me 
Want to help me get rid of my rivalries 
Want to be the ebony to my ivory 
But I'm straight though, thanks ma, I only chase doe 
We can lay for tonight but in the mornin

Basically made you into a don

So who the playa, I still keep you in the illest gators
Tailor made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscin'
On how I fuck the best a shit
Specially when I'm flippin' Baileys
Don't give a fuck about how you move with them other mamis
I push da Z, eating shrimp scampi with rocks larger than life
Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was
I got you frontin' in Armani sweaters
Before this rap shit
When you was in letters and bullshit berattas
And eek classes with mo in the glasses
Shows in Cali wit all the flavor suede Bally's
Now all your mens' up in your benz's
High post, I swear you be killin' me
Playin' inside my pubic hairs
I never worry bout them other chicks
Cause you proved who was your wiz
When you was spinnin' that bitch
I took a little when you was up north
Your commissary stay pilin'
How you livin' large on the island
All them collects have me vex
But when you come home
Knew I was comin' off wit half of dem checks
Now we on the rise

Jay-Z,"I'm done talking
Ran up in the spot gun smoking
Shot it in the air, one woke him
Sun-soaking, sweating in his bed like Dunlo
Thinking to himself what done provoked him
His thoughts is racing like a Vulcan
I swear I saw a light bulb when
He finally figured out who was the culprit
I said yeah, remember me from Friend or Foe when
I told you don't ever ever come around here no more
Time to pay now, he tried to rise, I wave the gun - lay down
This time you're really going to listen to Jay now
I try to talk sensibly, hoping that eventually you realize
I had this locked and it just wasn't meant to be
Plus I had sympathy and we all bought rims with your keys
And it wasn't afterthought that maybe you'll try to revenge me
But I was like ""Nah"", Homes had to know he was wrong
And if you caught me on the foul know you would sing me the same song
Plus you promised
And that's really no fun
And here I find you in this Motel 6 with all these guns
And all your goons, lined up in adjoining rooms
Like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon
But my mind's like a flower in bloom
Peep how my eyes just scower the room
I'm alert, plus I paid the clerk I got it laid out
You think you the first nigga I played out, in a 2 hotel town?
Come on now, I peep your Lexus at you
Left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town
Money well invested, rudely interrupted
Jamaican accents (Boy you know who you dun fucked with?)
A gun in your face and that's all you can come up with?
I'm done talking, back up and clap them, one in the abdomen
Do me a favor dude, get 2 ice cubes I pass them
Take that ice up, for the nicest MC
And please yo, tell BIG, he's unbelievable

Where is all the ice with all the platinum under that?
Those ain't Rolex diamonds, what the fuck you done to that?
Y'all rapping-ass niggas, y'all funny to me
Selling records, being you but still you want to  be me
I guess for every buck you make it's like a hundred for me
And still you running around thinking you got something on me

I ain't panicked, I been here before
Seems like only yesterday when I got up on that stage
In front of that crowd
And showed them who was who, and what was what
Man look at these suckers
I ain't no rapper, I'm a hustler
It just so happens that I know how to rap
Okay, I'm reloaded!

I did it again niggas
Fucked up, right?  I know
I know what y'all niggas asking yourself
Is he gonna ever fall off?
No

A lot of speculation
On the monies I've made, honeys I've slayed
How is he for real?  Is that nigga really paid?
Hustlers I've met or, dealt with direct
Is it true he slay the beef and slept with a tech?
What's the position you hold?  Can you really match
A triple platinum artist buck by buck by only a single goin gold?
Roc-A-Fella ship fold, and you're left out in the cold
Is it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for an O
For the millionth time askin me
Questions like Wendy Williams, harassing me
Then get upset when I catch feelings
Can I get a minute to breathe?  And in that minute you leave
While I'm looking at my Rol' ice spinning on my sleeve
Uh, nice watch, do you really have a spot?
Like you said in Friend or Foe and if so, what block?
What you doing in L.A., with Filipinos and ese's
Latinos and Cheve's, down by Pico with Frederico
I answer all your questions but then y'all got to go
Now the question I ask you is how bad you want to know? blow!

Roc-A-Fella y'all, uh
Know my style

Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, bout crime no more
Til I'm no more, cause I'm so raw
My flow expose holes that they find in yours
Wasn't for me, niggas still be dying for whores
But I hate when a nigga sit back, admiring yours
Young blood you better get that, we frying baccars
Niggaz don't want to be confined to riding the iron horse
And don't listen to the rappers, they dying to floss
I used to be O.T., applying the force
Shoot up the whole block, then the iron I toss
Come back with the click playing Diana Ross
I'm the boss and this is how it's gonna be
Burnt the turnpike, wild miles on the V
I got mouths to feed till they put flowers on me
And kiss my cold cheek, chicks crying like I was Cochise
Tombstone read 'He Was Holdin No Leaks'
Started from the crack game and then so sweet
Freaked it to the rap game, Jigga the old-G
On MTV, telling em how I sold D
And used to back work up out of apartment 4-B
Me and my homie, started out coldies
Picked the mailbox lock cause I ain't have no key
Had the cable with the anchor when Jaz made 'Sophie'
Then I went low key, but now I'm back it's on

There's gotta be them times you'll be wrong. Nah Mean?
How can a motherfucker go round and hate a nigga
He never even met that he don't even know and shit?
I think this rap shit is all beef

Y'all don't even know every day I'm living with stress
Got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest
Can't even enjoy myself at a party unless
I'm on the dance floor hot ass vest
You think I'm freakin' these chicks right?
I'try not to brush against they chest
You get a lawsuit for shit like that, I feel trapped
Swear to everything when I leave this earth
It's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
You could try me fucka but when I squeeze it hurts, fine
We'll lose two lives, yours and mines
Gimme any amount of time don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor drippin' tears on my sleeve
Told the judge didn't budge it was him or me
And I ain't trying to be hard but I'm guilty as charged
Put my mercy on this court and my faith in God
And pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars, Lucky Me

You only know what you see,
You don't understand what it takes to be me.

I hate all girls with alterior motives
That's why I'm twenty plus years old, no sons no daughters
Hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters
Hear the hate in my voice right? I hate that you noticed
Niggas wanna strip to the bone for shit you own
Hate a nigga like that fagot, get your own
Hate that I can't roam the street without the clip and chrome
Knowing one day I'ma have to flip, c'mon
You know the shit don't stop 'til the Crist don't pop
And you have to kill a nigga and your wrist don't lock
I'm trapped the whole worlds against me in fact,
It ain't no turning back. Bring It On
Hate the price of fame cause it cost too much
Can I live without y'all niggas saying I floss too much?
Hate the way you make this hate flow all through us
Steady looking for flaws through us, Lucky Me

You only know what you see,
You don't understand what it takes to be me
You only know what you see,
(Since I was four years old, I been told, everything that glitters ain't gold)
You don't understand what it takes to be me
(And now that I've arrived
I see those truths unfold before my eyes in this world so cold)

Nigga see you in the street, pretend to be friendly
But I know any type of success breeds envy
I know in the back of your mind your conjuring ways to hen me
Leave my friends in a circle pouring out Henny
But G's is heaven bound so how I'm goin' receive
Anything y'all pour to the ground next time throw it up
And ain't nothing changed so even in my afterlife I show it up
Don't grieve for me my art remains
Like a dart from the speaker to your heart
Spiritually through the portal now my words as a mortal
Plan to leave without a fight I plant a seed I give life
Though I can't see past the girls greed to call her wife
Next time your thinking heist better be precise
Cause I'm fully prepared. One of us is goin' leave here
I have no regrets even though I wanna see grow

Let the fiends know hey, we got some dope shit
Goin' need a middle man, so we look to radio
Let em test the product, give em a promo show
Just a breeze, not enough to catch a real vibe
Then we drop a maxi single and charge em two for five
Ain't trying to, kill em at first just, building clientele

You need another fix, you better cop these last two bricks
Cause when this shit flip, I'ma get on some other shit
Never pitching for a label, Jigga's the hook-up
You know my shit is fish scale, y'all niggas is cook up
Just blow up, scream my name from Brooklyn to Da-kota
They know my shit stretch without the baking soda
Went from an eighth, to a quarter, to a half a key

Busting my toast off the roof drinking ninety proof til spring
Real niggas do real things, check

We started out making, small time bacon
Two little niggas baking, talking bout whipping cakes
Get clothing and big cheddar, hoping it gets better
We had no knowledge of this shit we just was with whatever
In front of your building clocking, thought I was making a killing
Right in front of your children, eight ball in my side pocket
They was corrupt too, disrespecting the fiends I used to
Look up to, take it or leave it, fuck you
In different parts of the planet, Oakland to New York
I'm hollering Lifetimes, he hollering Life's Too $hort
Parallel lives and jewels held high
To the Range, to the Rove, get exchanged, for your souls

You criticize the way I walk, you wanna see my bankbook?
I'm not a crook, I flipped the script and changed my ways
So I can get paid, everyday
I see the same old shit, I see in the streets
I know you think I'm selling keys but I only sell beats
Dope fiend music, it's drug related
You can buy it on the corner get a radio and play it
It always sounds better when you turn it up loud

I know these gay ass record labels keep fucking niggas
It's just like in the streets main, how much you get?

That's right, I been a hustler for a long time
Always got the right beats, never saying wrong rhymes

Always see me at the bank and yes I'm going again
There ain't no dollar amount, that can make me happy

Jay-Z,"Look, if I shoot you, I'm brainless
But if you shoot me, then you're famous
What's a nigga to do?
When the streets is watching, blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake
Can't ignore it, that's the fastest way to get extorted
But my time is money, at twenty-five, I can't afford it
Beef assorted like Godiva chocolates
Niggas you bought it, I pull the slide back and cock it
Plan aborted, you and your mans get a pass
This rhyme, you're operating on bitch time
Y'all niggas ain't worth my shells, all y'all niggas
Trying to do is hurt my sales, and stop trips to John Meneill
The type to start a beef then run to the cops
When I see you in the street got one in the drop
When I'd rather be on tour getting a hundred a pop
Taking pictures with some bitches in front of the drop
The streets is watching

When the, streets is watching
Blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake
Can't ignore it

Now it's hard not to kill niggas
It's like a full time job not to kill niggas, can't chill
The streets is watching
When you froze your arms
Niggas want to test you whenyour gun goes warm
Can't get caught with your feet up, got to keep your heat up
Sweet niggas running 'round swearing shit is sweeter
Once you're tagged lame the game is follow the leader
Everybody want a piece of your scrilla, so you gotta keep it realer
Kidnap niggas want to steal you
Broke niggas don't want no cash, they just want to kill ya
For the name, niggas don't know the rules
Disrespecting the game, want you to blow your cool
Force your hand, of course that man's plotting
Smarten up, the streets is watching, it's on

When the, streets is watching
Blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake
Can't ignore it

My street mentality: flip bricks forever
Know me and money, we like armed co-defendants
Nigga we stick together
Shit whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground
Hustle harder until secret indictment time came around
And you can look up and down the streets and I can't be found
Put in twenty-four hour shifts but, that ain't me now
Got a face too easy to trace, niggas mouths got slow leaks
Had to hire a team of workers, couldn't play those streets
See out of space like Mercury, you jerkin me? Hectic
Had to call upon my wolves to send niggas the message
I said this: 'Let's play fair and we can stay here
I'm trying to transform you boys to men like daycare'
Ay there's money to be made and niggas got the picture
Stopped playing with my paper and we got richer
Then hard times fell upon us
Half of my staff had warrants
The other half in the casket lay dormant
I felt like life was cheating me
For the first time in my life I was getting money
But it was like my conscience was eating me
Was this a lesson God teaching me? Was he saying that
I was playing the game straight from Hell from which few came back?
Like bad coke, pimp or die, was my mind frame bad?
Was niggas thinking simplify was turning cocaine crack?
Ain't a whole lot of brain to that
Just trying to maintain a stack
And not collide like two trains that's on the same track
But get my life together like the oils I bring back
In the bottom of the pot where the water gets hot
Got my transporter take it across the border then stop
To set up shop with a quarter of rock
Here's the plan:
For three straight weeks, niggas slaughtered the block
But you know the game is food, it fucked up me and my dudes
One drought can wipe a nigga out, faster than the cops
And this unstable way of living just had to stop
Half of my niggas got time, we done real things
By '94 became the subject of half of y'all niggas rhymes
Public apologies to the families of those caught up in my shit
But that's the life for us lost souls brought up in this shit
The life and times of a nigga mind, excited with crime
And the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind
I figured, ""shit, why risk myself I just write it in rhymes
And let you feel me, and if you don't like it then fine?""
The mind state of a nigga who boosted the crime rate
So high in one city they send National Guards to get me",Streets Is Watching,1997
Jay-Z,"Uh-huh, je-je je-je-jeah
Ye-ye-yeah, ye-ye-yeah
How real is this, how real is this
Uh-huh huh, Inspect this here, check

I'm from where the hammer's rung, New's cameras never come
You and your man houndin' every verse in your rhyme
Where the grams is slung, niggas vanish every summer
Where the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run
Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
Faced with immeasurable odds still I get straight bets
So I felt some more something and you nothing check
I from the other side with other guys don't walk to much
And girls in the projects wouldn't fuck us if we talked too much
So they ran up town and sought them dudes to trust
I don't know what the fuck they thought, those niggas is foul just like us
I'm from where the beef is inevitable, Summertime's unforgettable
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
Your world was everything, So everything you said you'd do
You did it, Couldn't talk about it if you ain't lived it
I from where niggas pull your car, and argue all day about
Who's the best MC's, Biggie, Jay-Z, and Nas
Where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs always are
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars
Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R and R's
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
I'm from Marcy son, just thought I'd remind y'all

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, Ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, Ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, Ain't nothing nice

Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, Ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own

I'm from the place where the church is the flakiest
And niggas is praying to god so long that they Atheist
Where you can't put your vest away and say you'll wear it tomorrow
Cause the day after we'll be saying, damn I was just with him yesterday
I'm a block away from hell, not enough shots away from straight shells
An ounce away from a triple beam still using a hand-held weight scale
Your laughing, you know the place well
Where the Liqour Store's and the base well
And Government, fuck Government, niggas politic themselves
Where we call the cops the A-Team
Cause they hop out of vans and spray things
And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eight-teen
Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies
So tell me when I rap you think I give a fuck who criticize?
If the shit is lies, god strike me
And I got a question, are you forgiving guys who live just like me?
We'll never know
One day I pray to you and said if I ever blow, Let 'em know
Mistakes ain't exactly what takes place in the ghetto
Promise fulfilled, but still I feel my job ain't done
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, Ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, Ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, Ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, Ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own

I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards
Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen
I'm up the block, round the corner, and down the street
From where the Pimps, Prostitutes, and the Drug Lords meet
We make a million off of beats, cause our stories is deep
And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet
Niggas get lost for weeks in the streets, twisted off weed
And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat
Whether your four-feet or Minute size, it always starts out with
Three dice and shoot the five
Niggas thought they douce was live, now hit 'em with trips
And I reached down for their money, pa forget about this
This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist
And this glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this
Niggas will show you love, That's how they fool thugs
Before you know it your lying in a pool of blood

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice

Frames with the french name in the same night
Pull you and your tight friend
Lift your little dress like light wind, hah, then I slide right in
You know the whole repertoire, U.S. to the U-S-S-R
Sexing in a Lexus car
Match wits with the best of y'all the rest of y'all
Is like vege-tables in my presence, check it
Reminiscing to nothing you ever heard, Iceberg
Slim baby ride rims through the suburbs
Funds come in lump sums never ends deferred
Get money like I'm down South Wednesday the 3rd, it's on

Dough to get, more shows to rip
I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick
More O's than you know exist, bitch who you wit

Can't scheme on em, Roc-a-Fella got a team on em
Chicks dream on him trick cream on him
Lose it when dudes think it's just music
Lean on em flash green on em and diamond rings on em
Sex around the way girls down to mida's
I'm something every girl gotta have like Levi's
Chiquita, me got more, see I brawl
You can love me or hate me, either or

We taking all ya bitches, taking all ya money
Jay-Z rated A.G. baby that's All Good
I sink this ball in your hole, I'm Tiger Woods
If the money was the grass and your ass was tee
When I hit it with this club love you coming with me
Grip you right up under your ass, put your back on the wall
Kinda tipsy, seeing triple, so I'm fucking ya all
You remind me of this dream I had the night before
I'm kinda hoping the condom break to have a reason to go raw
I'm playing, hit the showers, hit the money spot
Where all the models play and big money is dropped
Drop the top, let her feel the moonlight it entranced her
She jumped all in my seat like some private dancer
I tell you something new, if you don't hop down off that
Butter soft shit with your shoes, I'ma step on the gas
She laughed, put her ass back in the proper place
She said, 'I played my cards right and look I got the ace'
I told her... 'Slow down baby'
You dealin with a baller, who, hold ground crazy it's on

Jay-Z,"Throughout my life (uh huh uh huh uh)
No matter what I've done.(Right)
You've been merciful and your love endureth (yeah)
Through all things (ye yeah) For that
I am eternally grateful.

Since my date of birth
Bought you nothing but hurt
Play those video games
Stole change from ya purse
Sat on the cold court bench
'til I was arraigned in ya skirt
Saw the pain in ya face
Through you maintained a smirk
All you did was motivate me
Don't let 'em hold you back
What I do I turned around
And I sold you crack
I was a bastard for that
Still I'm drowning in shame
Just remember one thing now
You're not to blame
You was newly separated
Tryin' to escape ya world
And through my thirst
I didn't help you
I just made things worse
I hated me and everybody
That created crack
Had me thinkin'
The newest kicks and the latest gat
Still haven't apologized
So please play this back
While I try to come to terms
With such a heinous act
You know in more than one way
Cocaine numbs the brain
All I did was think about
How the funds once came
Then I ran across this memory 
And it stung the brain
How can you ever destroy the beauty
From which one came
That's a savage you're the reason
Why me and these beats make a marriage
Why I rhyme above average and
I ain't shit
Glad you got yourself together
No thanks to me
Strong and beautiful the way thangs should be
You must love me

(You must love me)
Say that you love me
All I know say that you must love me.
Ohh yeah

We used to fight every night
But I never would suffer
Just smile my big brother's
Tryna make me tougher
As we grew fussing and fighting continued
As I plundered through ya stuff
And snuck ya clothes to school
Got intense real intense
As we got older
Never believed it would lead
To be popped in one of ya shoulda
With my rings knew you had it
Cause you took too long
As Mickey, Andy, and the girl that bought it looked on
Huffin' and puffin' gun in my hand
Told you step outside
Hoping you said no but you hurt my pride
Made our way down the steps
Maybe you thought it was just a threat
Or maybe ya life was just that crazy
And you was beggin' for death
Try to justify this in my young mind
But ya drillin' it
And my ego hurt combined
Drove me berzerk
Saw the devil in your eyes
High off more than weed
Confused I just closed
My young eyes and squeezed 
What a sound 
Opened my eyes just in time
To see ya stumbling to the ground
Damn what the fuck I done now
Runnin' around in a circle
Thinking I'm assed out
Hot gun burnin' my waist
Ran straight to Jazz' house
Like a stranger damn I just shot my nigga
And ran off into the night as if it was not my nigga
Left the scene how could I go out that way
Still you asked to see me in the hospital ya next day
You must love me.

(You must love me)
Say that you love me
All I know say that you must love me.
Ohh yeah

What after all the wrong I've done
I know you must


Everything in my power and within my frame
To protect you from this life and
Keep you away from the game
But you was one of the few people
That I can trust
And the fact of the matter I slang
These pies for us
You put the pressure on me dearly
Rarely would you let it go
Was a thousand and one times
I had to tell you no
When it was one of those days
When nobody was around
And I needed emergency trip
Out of town
Searched my mental rolodex
For all the numbers I know
As you stared in my face
Asking me could you go
I'm agreed said sender
Everything'll go smooth
Just tell her what to do
And everything'll go through
Strapped her body with them thangs
As you boarded the plane
Couldn't explain these strange feelings 
That I caught and the pain
I'm thinkin' why would I send you
When I knew it ain't right
I'm thinkin' what would
Make you sacrifice ya life
You must love me

(You must love me)
Say that you love me
All I know say that you must love me.
Ohh yeah

After everything that I've done wrong
I know inside you must love me
I know that you love me
You showed me I know it
I know
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
I know you must love me
Oh yes you do

Through the city, play Monopoly with real cash
Me and Biggie and the models be, shaking they saditty ass
And Parada be, somethin' you cats got to see
And the watches be all types and shapes of stones
Bein' broke is childish and I'm quite grown
Run up in the club with the ice on, me and Paisan'
Scope the spot out, see somethin' nice and I'm gone
You cats is home, screamin' the fight's on
I'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watchin Ty-son
Same night, same fight
But one of us cats ain't playin' right, I let you tell it
People place yourselves in the shoes of two felons
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get
And any chance you hit, we live for the moment

And rack up frequent flier mileage

Flights back and forth, pop corks of the best grapes
Make the best CD's and the best tapes
Don't forget the vinyl, take girls break spinals
Biggie be Richie like Lionel, shit
You seen the Jesus, dipped in H classes
Ice project off lights, chick flashes
Blind your broke asses, even got rocks in big mustaches
Rock top fashions
Ain't shit changed, except the number after the dot
On the Range, way niggas look at me now, kinda strange
I hate y'all too
Rather be in Carribean sands with Rachael
It's unreal, out the blue Frank White got sex appeal
Bitches used to go, ewww
Still tote steel, tryin' to see five mil
Off the sin-gle, for real
You ain't fazin' the amazin'
While your gun's raisin', mine is blazin'

Miraculous, pockets stay full
Niggas skip the bull 'cause we matadors
Snatch the P89s that we pack in the drawers
And we clap the doors of your Acuras
Snap like cameras on amateurs
Make you all dance, hold a hammer to yours
Jig and Big rock ice, no cracks or flaws
Everybody got a part to play, back to yours
Run up in your crib now, crack your doors
Watch the real players live, it's a habit to floss
Play the charts like The Beatles, y'all adapt you lost
And toast Cristal on behalf of y'all
Too bad for y'all
Ain't too many as bad as yours truly
Do we, we laugh at y'all
Little bastards y'all

Uhh, uhh
We hit makers with acres
Roll shakers in Vegas, you can't break us
Lost chips on Lakers, gassed off Shaq
Country house, tennis courts on horseback

Who say mobsters don't prosper
Niggas is actors, niggas deserve Oscars
Me I'm, critically acclaimed, slug past your brain
Reminesce on dames who, coochie used to stink
When we rocked house pieces and puffy Gucci links
Now we buy homes in unfamiliar places
Tito smile everytime he see our faces
Cases catch more than outfield-ers
Half these rappin' cats, ain't seen war
Couldn't score if they had point game, they lame

There's a bunch of Colombians coming in Friday, new guys
They said they got two keys for us, openers
Pure cocaine, you tell 'em, capiche?
I want you to go over there
And if it's what they say it is, you buy it, you bring it back

Yo, I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to free a Big Willie
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Shopping sprees, cop in three
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah, yes
Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 Gs to the crap shooter, niggas can't fade me
Chrome socks beaming
Through my peripheral I see you scheming
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Niggas is fiending, what's the meaning
I'm leaning on any nigga intervening
With the sound of my money machining
My cup runneth over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it, six digits and running
Y'all niggas don't want it
I got the Godfather flow, the Don Juan DeMarco
Swear to God, don't get it fucked up

I'm taking out this time (yeah, yeah, what)
To give you a piece of my mind
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star

Last seen out of state where I drop my sling
I'm deep in the South kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway switching fo' lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thang
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
Why play with fire, burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
'Til legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
What y'all don't know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause you can't knock the hustle

But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel ('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
The way you make me feel
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real

My function is to make much and lay back munching
Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew something to watch

I gotta, let you niggas know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle
It's a damn shame what you're not though: (who?) me
Slick like a gato, fucking Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
Straight bananas; can a nigga see me
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son you're too eager
You ain't having it, good me either
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us, huh
At my arraignment screaming
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
Thieving, as long as I'm breathing
Can't knock the way a nigga eating, fuck you even!

I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star
But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real",Can't Knock the Hustle [Radio Edit],1997
Jay-Z,"Uh, check it out, uh
I steps in where the Mo's and the hoes at bay-bee!
Fuck all that pretty shit
Takin' it back to the gutter for you motherfuckers
Niggas know the deal
Niggas know who the Don is
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Peep game, uhh, what, what

Out of this world like Mars, when I spit these bars
Come fuck with these stars up in luxury cars
We built them radars to stay free from the cops
Crucial choices to make, like A-C or the drop
Are we gonna stop?  Shit man never my squad go broke
Your squad arti-choke
Watch your circle vanish like cigar smoke
Ain't no joke, when your ones don't show
Nigga I know, might say 'Been There Done That' like Dre
Through hard work I earn the vault
Promise God to never look back or I turn to salt
Got nice watches nice cars nice bitches and rings
Guess it's safe to say a nigga like me got nice things
Can't relate to motherfuckers, who ain't go no cake
When you all fucked up, and can't get no break
When your fake ass friends, don't help you out when you need it
Be on some real bullshit, politely tell you to beat it
Fuck that, get your own nigga, don't ask me for shit
That's what I did, now they all askin' for hits
Nigga it's on for the simple fact I let it be known
We still fly but separately cause now I, charter my own
Propellers, Goodfellas, leave all them playa haters jealous
Billboard charts should tell us, they can't touch us
Why niggas bring the ruckus?
Because release day is bigger than Mandela's, motherfuckers

Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets, these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive
It's just reality

Yeah, make you a deal, check
These here's the dog years and motherfuckers don't shed
I try to bring you life but motherfuckers want dead
So I travel with the babble, with the chrome, with the lead
Cause when it's on, then it's on, the shots flowin' through your head
I been rich I been poor I saved and blown bread
Some say I been here before because of the way I zone
Some said, Jigga zone is like the fallin' of Rome
Reoccurring, that he thinks like that cause he's observing
Won't be known until I'm gone and niggas study my bones
Mentally been many places, but I'm Brooklyn's own
In the physical, one seems, like a lost body
In fact my thoughts don't differ much from that of God body
But it's the odd shottie, that got cats, likening me
to the mob John Gotti, rap dudes bitin' me cause
I got it locked like the late Bob Marley
Pardon me y'all, the great Bob Marley
Solemnly we mourn, all the rappers that's gone
Niggas that got killed in the field and all the babies born
Know they ain't fully prepared for this New World Order
So I keep it ghetto like sunflower seeds and quarter waters
You walk em through it, you know, talk em through it
Know these beads is more than music whenever I talk to it
Destined for greatness and y'all knew this, when I doubled the pie
Had a shorty and a girdle comin' out of B-W-I (in school)
I hated algebra but I loved to multiply
And I told my nigga Big I'd be multi' before I die
It's gonna happen whether rappin' or clappin' have it your way
Cause if that's my dough you're trappin', I'm clappin' your way

Living in these ghetto streets, these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive
It's just reality

Damn it feel good to see people up on it
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
GS's with BB's on it, supreme schemes, to get Richer
than Richie, quickly, niggas wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat
High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
in my circumference, mad bitches, with mad lucci
Bulletproof vestes under they coochie
Spittin' my Uzi, don't lose me, my trigga niggas represent
Drivin dirty in J-30's gettin' bent
And to my hit hoes, my murder mommies
I be smokin' trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin' niggas with punany, like heiny
and Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw you on the floor with the virus
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds to choke
Got lawyers watchin' lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it
Them country niggas call me Frank White
I'm squirtin' off in my loft of course I know my shit's tight
Sunrise open my eyes no surprise
Got my shorty flyin' in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half black half oriental eighty-six she got me rental
The situation ain't accidental
What? From a, from a young G's perspective

While others spit that Wonderama shit, me and my conglomerate
Shall remain anonymous, caught up in the finest shit
Live out my dreams until my heart give out
Involved with cream, you know exactly what this shit's about
Fuck y'all mean? Handling since a teen, I dish out
Like the point guard off your favorite team, without doubt
My life ain't rosy but I roll with it
My mind was fine 'til the dough hit it and told me that the Mo' did it
And now it's kosher, shit is so Hasidic
I blow a digit on a diamond in a minute but no bitches
Watch how I'm walking cause even the thoroughest niggas be narc'in
Tryin' to strike a bargain hoping that they might get pardoned
Shit I'm involved with got me pins and needles
And my cerebral breeds the wickedest evil thoughts that this sport'll feed you
Peep facts, in the game so deep fiends could catch ya
Freeze off my knee cap, can y'all believe that?
Got the city drinking Cristals, re-up the fee
Rappers going broke, tryin' to keep up with me
My rise to riches surprised the bitches: think harder
You know this nigga, Jay-Z, Shawn Carter

Niggas got them kinda dreams from Jay
You in the streets, nigga, make your moves, get your mail
Niggas'll coast in the SL but can't post bail
Niggas'll roast a L but scared to throw your toast, well
I'm here to tell niggas it ain't all swell
There's heaven, and then there's hell niggas
One day you're cruising in your 7, next day you're sweating, forgetting your lies
Alibis ain't matching up, bullshit catching up
Hit with the RICO, they repo your vehicle
Everything was all good just a week ago
'Bout to start bitching ain't you? Ready to start snitching ain't you?
I'll forgive your weak ass; hustling just ain't you
Aside from the fast cars, honeys that shake they ass at bars
You know you wouldn't be involved
With the underworld dealers, carriers of mac-millers
East Coast bodiers, West Coast cap-peelers
Little monkey niggas turn gorillas
Stopped at the station, filled up on octane
And now they not sane and not playing, that goes without saying
Slingin' day in and day out, 'til money play in, then they play you out
Trying to escape my own mind, lurking the enemy
Representing infinity with presidencies, you know?

Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick
More O's than you know exist, bitch who you wit

Down in the grill in the Villa gettin hilla
Never know em at the resort, readin to ride with us all
Checkin out this new wine, inhalin the cork
Million miles from the puddles the rainy days the tussles
Reign in ways to hustle, so we won't get caught
Had beef of all sort but I turned it around
Chose my steps more wisely, I'm learnin the ground
I was so gung-ho when I earned my first pound
Now it's million dollar deals, straight turnin em down
Roc-a-Fella make or break me, til death do us
Won't be in your right mind, you ever step to us
Been there, when I was in my tenth year, went there
Then I realized that it didn't make sense there
Backtrack, show me where the cash at, and plus
frivilous beef, please, we lookin past that
Y'all can gossip while we learnin the world
Drop the hot shit never returnin your girl, it's on

Jay-Z,"(Jay) Fuck that 
(This is it right here baby)
You know what it is

Yo, I used to have bad luck 
Now you might see me in a Jag truck
Mad stuck, either with a dime or a bad duck
Double-R T with the matchin' bandana
38-snub blue steel with no hammer
And I see y'all niggas tryin' to glance at the 'Kiss
'Cause I walk around with your whole advance on my wrist
Phoning your women, drunk off Corona's and lemon
And you know I'm still writin' the mean, lightin' the green
I need the bugy, even though I look, right in the beam
Judge find out it's my team, he boost they bails
Niggas throw us on they album, try to boost they sales
We put our pies on the table and our eyes on a label
'Cause them rednecks up in the mountains'll try to slay you
(They call me) Raspy, tell you what I want you to know
Fuck what you ask me, you probably don't want me to blow
I got a lot of horsepower so I'm able to skip
Usually a good nigga, even though I'm able to flip
You pay 30 for the 'Kiss (uh-huh) a 100 for The L.O.X. (Yeah)
And if we cool, then I write a hook for a drop
Whatever's in the bank is my bet, a z-bull's my pet
And you can bet he'll get the legs and the neck

Yo when my gun bust, send niggas to the fish like Swanson
New York's youngest Bumpy Johnson, I put fear in y'all heads
Sheek Luc', type of nigga gasoline y'all beds
And that's warnin', if you all alive in the mornin', that's fine
Now I suggest you hit the block and get what's rightfully mine
I want PC, see me?  Tuck in your chains
I got niggas my pop's age that lifestyle ain't changed
It's like wake up, move a brick, half of it slow
Make car money, check with Sheek, go fuck with a hoe
I rock a waist length mink, do-rag under my fitted
And I don't even want waves, Timbs be halfway new
That's Sheek in the dress-up club 'cause I don't fuck with shoes
And for my nigga's life, I swear to the Bible, let it be told
I put thirty in your head, all in the same hole
'Cause we got the same goal, and you try an' tamper with mine?
Don't make me motherfuckin' leave you with some shit in yo' spine
Fuck with me you be a was nigga, nigga was dope
Nigga was gettin' money 'fore I extorted your coke, 'ju crazy?

Ayo, catch me with a thirty-eight, box and shells
In a ninety-eight Lincoln eatin' pasta shells
Order to go, always got a box of L's
Blow, stay on the low, get a Heine' and swig
I'm Pinero, so I hate a snake, rat, or a pig
I pop shit 'cause I'm the second best, the first was B.I.G.
Y'all niggaz is son-ned out, let me speak to your father
'Cause I like to play chess and I swing the revolver
If I don't like a nigga, I don't even be bothered
I spit, I'm just a crooked nigga goin' legit
You hold your nine if you holdin' a brick
Common sense, Fed drama, you hit the Bahamas, get bent
L.O.X. get respect like Sonny from ""Bronx Tale""
Us and DMX, the Ruff Ryder cartel
Thirsty to live, are y'all niggas eager to die?
I tell all my niggas ride, you won't leave with a dime
Motherfucker

Yeah, yeah
I'm a monster, I sleep whole winters, wake up and spit summers
Ghetto nigga, puttin' up Will Smith numbers
Surrounded by 6's and Hummers, bitches among us 
Tryin' not to let this bullshit become us 
It started from hunger, til it all went insane
Now bitches notice the chains now that I hit my number
The chickens I twisted see the digits unlisted
The beeper done changed, you dead bitch, the Reaper done came
I suggest niggaz stop speakin' my name
'Cause trust me, y'all can still feel the heat in the rain
I keep creepin', streets keep watchin', I keep poppin '
Niggaz is hot heads and the bullets is heat-seekin'
Jay flow for pesos, chase hoes, not
I just circle 'round the block in a drop
Tell them jump through the top (Uh-huh) 
Where the sun roof used to be
I could see y'all not used to me
Nigga flows like none other, I'm the meanest
Toughest Don Dada, the gun butt ya
You the type that bust a lot of shots and none touch ya
I'm the type that get excited, when the gun touch ya, motherfuckers
Y'all niggas 'bout to witness a dynasty like no other

Grr. I'm headed nowhere fast
Run in the place, gat in my waist
Niggas wanted a taste, but wouldn't come to my face
So what that mean?  You cats is playin' games again
So now what I do?  Start namin' names again (What)
All you motherfuckers know, that I speak from the heart (Uh)
Play like you don't know, L.O.X. is gon' bark
We can take it there, but to make it fair, get some more niggas
Styles, Sheek, Jay, we comin' with like four niggaz (Aight)
Y'all niggaz, best to stop playin', it'll be the ones you forgotten about
That'll get you shot in your mouth
Got my dogs covered (Uh)
Plus it's all gravy like chicken when it's smothered (What)

So I outblast til it's empty clips
And I outlast niggaz, survival of the fit
One life, I gotta make sure it's done right
Cause them yet to have a conversation bout reincarnation
Ball out, until I fall out
Stick thick chicks, try to tear they wall out
Hard to think about your future with, nothin to gain
Hard to concentrate on school with stomach pain
Life's harsh, I know y'all runnin from 'caine
but it'll only catch you and track you down
With no deal, who you gonna rap to now?
Start your own record company, that's profound

Gettin fly is the minimal, holdin somethin is the principal
Respect this young nigga that's, holdin the torch
Preachin shit like the crack game, don't take shorts
Throw it down it's a bet, nigga roll hard

So So Def
Yeah, yeah

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Come on, y'all wanna floss wit us
Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Ya slackin on your pimpin, turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

I flex the Rol', sign a check for yo' hoe
Jigga's style is love, X and O
Save all your accolades, just the dough
My game is wide, all lames aside
Tryin to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it
Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up
Multi til I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas
Me and J.D. got it locked crazy
Where you at haters?

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

My cake thick, I live the life
Eatin' crab, watching bitches shake shit all night
I make the big moves, do the big things
Take small groups, turn them into big names
The big dog with the big chain, frostbit bracelet to match
Cats say I'm the shit man
The type of nigga that you need in yo' crew
Type of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do
Get more burn than a candle
Too hot to hold, too much to handle
In the black C-low, he know if she look
She go bye-bye with da-da and I ain't gotta say no mo'
I'm ""The Truth"" like A.I., got the proof and stay fly
In the safest shit you could never buy
Know why?  Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing
I don't know about y'all but every night I swing

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Ya'll shit ain't for real til y'all ship a mil'
And ya hit a R&B chick and she fit the bill
Said she loved my necklace, started relaxin
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
Went from wholesome to Jigga, you awe-some
Baby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey
Platinum, spend your whole life in the day
What's down is a bet, roll the dice

Yeah, yeah, so let's play
So what you went gold and rock a Roley with the ice bezel
It's gon' take a lot mo' to see my level
Where I'm at, your check, you better double that
And personally your raps is where the trouble at
I'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain
In the platinum frame screamin it's not a game
Gleamin, from ear to ear, wrist to wrist, ring and chain
Even me and Jay-Z got it locked, crazy

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam

But it's all good watch me do this shit

[Cam'Ron]
Yo yo yo yo ay yo from my town to Chitown
R. Kelly got some thugs to make you lock down
Voice cry hot sounds tied down cop twisters
Shop lifters with Benini schemes
Smoke greenie green candyman up in Cabrini green
Some cats I know like to splurge on they wrists
But my man karate man cut the nerves out his fist
But yo put your hands up y'all it's love in here
It ain't shit but a thug affair
I'm at the bar spendin' thug money
Hustle much huh, they say I love money carats like Bugs Bunny
So let's slide you got the right thong
Ju don know I'm all night long
The DJ playing all the right songs
To the BM, rims are muy bien
It's R. Kelly killer camp
Girl can you dig now
Next time you see him yo he lay Mr. Big style

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
To all my players and my thugs, to the all the honeys in the club
To all the hoods that show me love, we ride, we ride
To all my ballers rocking ice, getting a room for the night
Taking first class flights, we ride, we ride

[Noreaga]
I used to be in Chitown and collect panties
When I'm in Cabrini green you know I hit Sammy's
Thugged out yo my people giving eye jammies
Now them shorites say I'm cute when they can't stand me
R. Kelly yo I'm right from the belly you know the soul
Everything that we spit on is platinum gold
But now it's on the love all the players and the thugs
Yo it's a party going on meet me right at the club
We got some chickens in the living room getting it on
And they ain't leaving til six in the morning
Thugged out some people gettin' head while we on and
Tear the club up every time we performin'
Gun up in your waist please don't shoot up the place
Because this shorty right here lookin' good in my face
Hey yo it's so deep I told shorty just last week
Uh huh, it's like you remind me of my jeep

[Vegas Cats]
Only ballers be allowed up in here
Moneymakers got my thug niggas watchin' my rear for player haters
18 and I'm livin' the dream go figure
How a nigga that's younger than you ice bigger
Don't sweat that stick the rap nigga try that
Call my nigga R. Kell if you need a hit black
And when you get make it known baby who did it
It'll make your fans hit the stores and go get it
Now here come a bitter sweet note for the fellers
Left out the club with her friend now she jealous
Mad 'cause she chan't ride on the LS
Yeah she kinda mad but a baller could care less
While you sleep sleep sleep
I'm inna Benz going beep beep beep
Got your girl sayin' yo who he
So let's ride to Rockland's party

Ghetto prone federal Jay-Z shake the dice let 'em go
Better know I tear down every show better known cheddar prone
Like the chrome big Rolls say it y'all all I need is four bars
I'm hotter than a lot of men switch up cars like Rodman's hair color
And hit your broad I'm borderline too much for the mortal mind
Every time you order me wine finder's mortify now pop that cork then pour the wine
Represent New York to Chitown like what floss mine like of course mine what
Never cross my family can we all get along hell no I'm tryin' to tell y'all
Here it is that rule that biz got your baby daddy but Jay-Z true that is
Better school that kid on whose shoes that is or who I be nigga V-I-P jigga

Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya

Contend with six, two jobs to survive, or

You a punk
I been with made people, connected people
Who you been with? Chain snatching, jive-ass, maricon motherfuckers
Why don't you go get lost
Get out of here, go kick a freestyle or something

You're now tuned into the greatest
Motherfuckers can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us
Can't touch it, fuck it, can't see em, try to be em
Both shows sold out your coliseum, 8th wonder
Locked rap for trey summers, poker faces with the aces under
Face one up, to take over, the break's over
Nigga I'm the god MC, me, Jay Hovah
Shit knocking, almost a crime, get Cochran
Banging to the hearse where my doctors hand
Hot land, FBI, DEA, I did crime, got away
They want to see me pay, motherfuckers better ride
If they try to plant, under the seat of my car
Even a half a gram, better flame those, plainclothes
Same goes for lame hoes, cocaine rapper
Rep ya game pros

We celebrate this, while you sitting back screaming you hate this
Try to rape this, get caught in my crime matrix
Spitting sperm inside of latex
You get, no respect like a child rapist
Delegate this, men just giving face lifts
Leave your melon spacious, career felon, no hiatus
Nor Caesar's, the CIA flooded my block with diseases
Informants, heating the spot up like global warming
Who start shit? my style is laced with arsenic
Odorless tasteless, cause of death is traceless
I know you want to see me wasted
You call the order, I'll be in hell
Team Roc sweater and ice water
Righteous, dominate the global, my life's a novel
Blazing in Barnes and Noble, idolize the vocals
Y'all niggas is local but that's evident
I'm resident evil, moving like ?

Millionaire that flow like water, rap niggas running
I, oughta applaud ya, clap at ya
Point the mac at yea, niggas caught up
Brought up in the rapture, my flows torture
Like a compound fracture, can't fuck with it
For the love of sex money and drugs
Affiliated with the sets tecs honies and thugs
Let the four power, rain on niggas like a spring shower
And bring flowers for the bodies that surround us
If you was looking you found us
Moving with speed, tried to play superman
Ended up like Chris Reeves
Paraplegic, precise minds like the Pharaoh's of Egypt
Shot through a barrel niggas narrowly weaved it
Keeping my team top seeded with the sweet 16's
Bulging out of my jeans, on the ten-speed weeded
Holding, ? shots with you like a secret
It's like a story never told, but believe it

Street anthem anchor, quick to trade shots just like a banker
Lick a round, niggas hit the ground like Sanka
I got ya screw face in forty-two ways, aim better
Than toothpaste, Jerry McGuire
""Show me the money"" like clue tapes
Run up in your spot with a few eights, zoning
Known men, home in, all of my homies condone sin
Four shots spin ya like chrome rims
Put a part right through your dome like the omen, foaming
White sheets got ya wrapped like a roman
Back in new york, honey wants it, just spit blood and talk funny
Niggas is cartoons, picture styles that's fully developed
Like dark rooms, hits fat, cub with a harpoon
Heat-seeking, grill hunting, still fronting?
Keep squeezing, fuck it, I leave the whole street wheezing
No motherfuckers hope I fail, and gotta provoke the frail
Got em scared to drop like soap in jail

Yeah, there you have it
Just think of ours as can't be touched, tested, whatever
Never disrespect this thing of ours

So I sorta say my goodbyes to the straight and narrow
I found a new route, you 'bout to see my life change
I make the means justify the ends

Jay-Z,"Back again and back again
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
And back again and back again
As a youth I used to hold the weed up
Old heads said I thought more like a soldier than a leader
In order to succeed I had to slow my speed up
Didn't listen to stuff took another puff of the chieva
They said believe us or not trust is somethin' you earn
With every mistake you make back to us you return
Probably would go Hollywood I thought he was jokin'
My first taste of fame I hit the first thing smokin'
All engulfed into honeys the pussy was tight
If she threw the pussy right I got mushy like
Damn baby I love you take all my cash
""You ain't got to lie Jay,"" you already gettin' the ass
She loved that I was a thug it turned her on
Soon as I got soft it turned her off
I got relaxed put my feet up start dissin' my friends
And that's when the ceiling fell in
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
And back again and back again
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
And back again and back again
I came through with the shines
Like the streets was blind
Didn't master my Algebra no caliber
Stick me? I was thinkin' how and for what
But reality bites like a thousand mutts
Nothin' worse than the person that's foul with guts
To stick you quicker

This brand new nigga
Yup this is the foulest this ain't Hollywood
It's the Wild West whoever guns is the loudest
That's who's the best now take ten steps and draw
Who dope can take ten steps and remain raw
Who has no regards for the law?
Me that's who now let me ask you
Did you not know if we all don't eat
Some day that we all would beef?
Did you know about the crabs in the barrow
They would hear me creep
It's a muthafuckin' war in these streets
I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto
And I'm back again I'm back again
I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto
And I'm back again I'm back again

From Marcy to Hollywood
And back again and back again
From Marcy to Hollywood
And back again and back again

As a youth I used to fold up
Old heads said I thought more like a leader than a soldier
Back in the days never no heat thought shit was cool
Good cat personified even went to school
Learned wild shit made me feel kinda live
Off of nothin' with this bullshit 9 to 5
I stayed broke made me easier to provoke
Ready to yoke the first muthafucka that joked
Same dude with the hard bottom
Went from laid back to locced out
From talk it over to t...I shot him
Ready to perish all the shit you cherish
Leave you the wettest I got a ""You die first,"" fetish
I can recall helpin' old chicks across the street
Now I help myself liftin' cats off they feet
Can't give a fuck nigga I just lost my moms
Why I need to feel something steel in both my arms
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
And back again and back again
I went from Marcy to Hollywood

I'ma make it real easy for why'all. You got three different
Types of nigga. First cat, as a youth is real wild and
For whatever reason he hit the money or whatever,
Cooled out. You got one cat that's ghetto, grimy always
Remained ghetto. You know that type. Then, you got
One cat very smart young man. E'rybody wanted him
To be a lawyer doctor whatever. Pressure drove him crazy
He wiled out. Ha geah...

I take nine to the chest and I swear to the heaven sky's, I bless
The mics until the day I rest, till they can feel what I feel
I'ma try my best, and if you real like I real
You can provide the rest
Anything left out, you can blame it on the brain, not the heart
I'm playing my part, stretched out, just about the best out
Any nigga realer than me, is in a mess hall with their chest out
Any rapper with less clout, sell more records than me
We extort them as soon as they record 'em,  bleek
My name is clear, back when a shorty used to braid my hair
On the project stairs, once I drop to a ceaser ma I don't need ya

Like flubber I hover above the city in a private jet, the livest set
Press you're brakes, feds wanna investigate, mr. I don't cop nothin
Less than eight, and anything involved with my name
Regardless of the fame
It's hard, I can't even walk through harlem again,
Charge it to the game, I'm platinum like american express
My boy died, and all I did was inherit his stress
To make every jam tougher, you ain't my man fuck ya
I suggest let you live right?  negative, I swear
It's dough or die, I hope your soul provides you with an afterlife
Close you're casket tight
Take you're last two deep breaths and pass the mic

Soon as the slang's spitted
If you came you get it
Plain as a game with them thangs with it
On co-sign and the whole nine
Leave you where I find yo ass - lost with no signs

Got a vest on, went to Folsom

Nigga, dangerous, watch your language with me
It's People's Court, we hold court in the street

I give a shit if it's small claims like stealin' your bitch
Or if it's Supreme Court like stealin' your bricks
Look, my guns is all-range, more pain
Indifferential, whether you're big money or small change
When I cock it - ball game
My pistols never miss-trial, here's the determent
With no chance of parole bullets comin' concurrent
I'm like ""Why, nigga, try Jigga?"" You must remember
It's like bein on trial for your life with a public defender
Let the jury fill the seats up and start the court calendar off
With docu number 9mm
All rise
The Honourable Jay-Z presides
Instead of a mallet I hold a tool
All objections over-ruled
Say your opening arguments, hope you understand it
Two guns, right over left, that's how I cross-examine
Like Tom Cruise, popppin' with the Top Gun you lose
Jigga's no lie, and why'all can't handle the truth

No flow's sicker, no cell can hold Jigga
Since I dropped 'Reasonable Doubt' no cocaine convictors
No contest in a rhyme fest, I'm best
Under oath raise my hand, and I spit it - honest
Know our facts for real 'fore why'all decide to act ill
When you blow trial ain't no comin' back on the pill
It's Murder One, bail set at a half a mill
It's Murder One, for you backwards muthafuckas: red-rum
Commit hate crimes, fake crimes, I hold in contempt
You get state time for fakin' like you greater than Him
So cop a plea to lessen charges, pay your fine at the Desk Sergeant
Say you're sorry, then - take your property
I be sho' defended, flow splendid, no co-defendant
While you niggas hold trial with no motions in it

Pick up the pace quick, why worry about a replacement?
When I stepped in came wit' my feet in the pavement
Leave niggas in amazement

And guess what the ingravement say?

In association with the streets 
The Black Gangster 
In conjunction 
With everything official 
Yeah 

I ride through the ghetto windows down halfway 
Halfway out of my mind music on 9 blasting Donny Hathaway 
Me and my niggas spending half the day 
Plotting how we gon get this math with out getting blast away 
I wake up to the same problems after today 
Life is harsh, niggas gotta ? 
Right from the start they place me in the ghetto tender age of nine 
My tender mind had to surrender to crime 
Wouldn't wish this on nobody like the end of like mine 
Ever since I was quite young a nigga been in divine 
Had to scratch for every plaque, even rap ain't even all its cracked up to be 
Niggas don't stack up to me 
Had to hustle in a world of trouble 
Trapped in, claustrophobic the only way out was rapping 
America don't understand it, the demographics I tapped in 
I'm the truest nigga to do this nigga and anything else is foolish 
Like those who stay high, under God's grey skies 
My lyrics is like Bible, made to save lives 
In the midst of all your misery nigga, stay fly 
Never let em see you frown, even smile when you down 
Shit, I floss on my off-days fuck what they all say 
Niggas can't stop me with rumors, I'm too strong 
All-day 
Socks explode and sweatpants pockets is bulging 
Holding it down on the corner with my glock holding 
My spot is golden, drop the price on the coke and 
Drove the competition out and let the dough flow in 
The cops is closing in, I can do the time 
But what's really on my mind, is there's no hoes in the pen 
I play the low and try and make it hard to find me 
Feds still tryna build a case since '93 
I told them, I'm retired but they like whatever 
You know them pigs don't want to see you get your life together 

[Chorus] 
I'm stuck in this life forever 
The more things change the more they stay the same 
Who am I to change the game? 
You gotta move quick like heroin and cocaine 
The blocks hotter than its ever been 

Once again 
Hold the gun at eye level, I ain't afraid of conflict 
I let the nine rip, nigga say ""hi"" to the devil 
I blind with the bezel, I'm in line with the ghetto 
What y'all niggas afraid of my mind or the metal 
Niggas tryna subtract my life, my mathematics is precise 
I carry the nine, so fucking with me just ain't the answer 
I just can't lose when I was young I was like Fresh 
Poppa raised me to chess moves 
And though your gone I'm not bitter you left me prepared 
We got divided by the years, but I got it from here 
Don't sweat that, sounds bump from Marcy to Lefrak 
To that project in DC where my man caught his death at 
Over my years I've seen Rooks get tooken by the Knight 
Lose they Crown by tryna defend a Queen 
Checkmate, in 4 moves the Bobby Fischer of rap 
With raw moves in a time where we all move 
Lets face it either your dough chasin, or basing 
Lacing, cranks got your face sprung like mason 
Careful, any infultration I'm leaving niggas 
Leaving more than just information

Busters they wanted to rush us
Love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya
When you blush you turn blue if your grade is right
You can light up the whole room, turning day from night
When the summertime is in and the tops are down
With you around my neck we lock the whole block down (that's right)
It took shortsleeves and loungin' to understand
The reason they call you ice, everybody freeze
Ain't a pendant in the sun who can shine like you
And that platinum in the charm who can blind like you
The direct reason why niggas do they crimes they do
I used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools
Guess I was jealous that they was so next to you
So I devoted half my time to invest in you
The other half was spent on protecting you
Cause you belong to me, now sing ya song for me

I'm often with you so they wonder bout the juice I got
I took you from the projects and an abusive pops
From the bottom to the top
The skateboard to the drop
From the nada to the Prada
I got ya like I got ya
From the first time I put you round my neck and locked ya
It was then I knew everywhere I went you'd follow
Soon I spent every dolla you became my habit
other brothers vice was smoke, mines was carats
The more checks I got the more I laced my crew
The rocks got bigger, watch face got blue
Tricked a little bit, shit I lace my Boo
Fuck it, my mistress I laced her too
Cop my jewels twice, like deja vu
If they ever met in the mall, it's ova ya'll
Just the way I do, and either way you win

And the wedding band you love
In the gold chain you thug
Sometimes you given just because
And the tennis bracelet means they want relations
Know that they wanna fuck the only reason they give you up
In the hands of goldiggas you never enough
Rings, things,  just never enough
With me and you together gon shine to the end
I mean the thugs love ya but ya girls best friend

I'm your average, ghetto nigga turned maverick

I don't have step, I leave it in you're averix
Then shoot it it the air, whatever I have left

Wether clubs or the street, I out ball y'all

Make a bet I turn the ace up, and Jay, what

I never stop making money don't give 'em no slack
Drinking dirty motherfuckers til a hoe come back
With my scratch, bitch I was born to mack
To uphold the pimping, I was sworn to that
I hear a lot of shit talking when I listen to rap
Only a few MC's get to hang that plaque
On the wall rappers ball, but they don't live phat
Nigga, I doubt if you go gold or platinum
What we do has only been mastered by a few
I take a half a million tapes sell 'em straight to you
All that shit niggas talking just cant be real
I don't need a record deal, I need eighteen wheels

Somebody, she got a new Too tape
And hes spitting pimp game with his homeboy Jay

Now here they come again the gold diggas trying to get paid,
Wanna trick the old rich niggas, trying to get laid
She'll suck his dick, as soon as she meet him
Don't have to sell a body for me I don't need her
To turn tricks for me, how much you cost bitch?
I'm all about large bank deposits
On and off the mic I always set trends
Either you see with bitches, or I'm rolling with pimps
Brook-laan to Oakland, I keep smokin'

The kinda niggas that'll take a square bitch around the corner
Put this pimp game on her
I don't fuck with broke hoes and I don't trick
But I'll still rub my big ass dick on her clit
Get her hooked, wanna be mine I need some money
If she ain't kicking in all the time she don't want me

Hoes, flows, money, cars
Y'all wannabe stars cant fuck with none of these bars
This is real nigga rap, we can spit it through the mic
And you can feel niggas scratch, and sell a mil if that
So real when we drop this shit its in trouble
When I guess the pair you gotta ship it double
In the independent phenom, y'all miniature dons
Wannabe jigga, pops styles and hennessy richa'
When I die, leave my canopy richa'
I put it down hard ever since I entered the pit'cha
Can fuck with me for records to the recreational cent'a

When will you see
That there's no one like me (no one no one)
No matter how hard they try to be
Cause they just don't flow (they don't flow)
The way that I flow (The way I flow)
So baby don't fight it

It seems the more that I try
The harder you make it for me to get by
If you only knew how I felt inside
I'm sure you would be so blind 
Cause another like me you won't find

You better think it over before you try 
To say that no one can give you what you like
Cause I know just what you want
And there's no way you can front on me
I hope you see
That you belong to me

Trick don't leave for ten months

I'm tight though, mad that you're platinum plus
Let me find out that some broad got you acting up
Spread your wings so I figure you'll be back in touch
Wondering if whats-his-name will he tap my stuff
Yo, all I wanna do if get this doe together
Even if you want this on the low whatever
Fuck around, it's gonna be a hoe forever
Cause when it's beef, I know that we're gonna throw together
But we got issues nigga, cause what you did for me lately
To be a little skanky with them bitches that hate me
You know the kind, door knockers hollering at that

Popping the Crist, shit hoppin' outta your wrist
Popping your shit, New York's hottest bitch
