Keith Murray,"Yo, now when you hear the name Keith Murray, don't think violence
That's nonsense, me and Meth put that to silence
I'm a product of the streets, master of the breaks and beats
Lyrically headstrong and can't be beat

Triple minded, mentally combineded underground pirate
Microphone tyrant, always comin' sideways
And Topsy turvy, lyrical crash-up derby
Come, Filthy McNasty, pretty gritty dirty

Lyrical sayin' MC slayin', 'Hip Hop Quotable'
Unquotable, sociable thirty-eight caliber style swayin'
Open your mind to visualize what I'm sayin'
The products of the streets don't be playin'

It's a bloody ambush like a dirty douche in ya tush
When I push, push up in ya bush
Superstar status, break off beats, the baddest
Style's the baddest, bring extra clips to stop the madness

Yo, we in the place
(Now whut's up?)
DJ, pick up the pace
(Now whut's up?)
Gyrate, feel the bass
(Now whut's up?)
What the deal, huh?
(Now whut's up?)

Aiyyo we ain't playin' fair no more, there's somethin' new in store
A Hot Boy but not from the 504
New technique to rock the mic
Lyrical 'Blade' sharp like Wesley and N'Bushe Wright

Soundbombin' could be a catastrophe
When NASA blast off, Flex blast off me
E-vincible, rap round your left ventricle
So let's be sensible

E temperamental, quick to dismember you
Wyclef that 'November' you
They wish they can do what I can do
If you could switch brains, you would, wouldn't you?

My style is Mike, Vince, Earvin
Jordan, Carter, Julius, servin'
MC's at will, I'm trickery, Lou ain't stickin' me
A curve ball, Mark ain't hittin' me

Yo, we in the place
(Now whut's up?)
DJ, pick up the pace
(Now whut's up?)
Gyrate, feel the bass
(Now whut's up?)
Yo, what the deal, huh?
(Now whut's up?)

Yo, rapid gunfire destroy ya boys and unemploy some
Put the headphones on your kid like Castor Troy's son
Darts'll damage ya dogs where the you-Haul in my truck
The camera installed, hand upon my balls

Call the morgue, I'm killin' 'em, even Kyle is not feelin' 'em
When I drill 'em with skills of ten Eminems
You feminine, don't even call my name
I stay locked down walkin' with a ball and chain

Put the mac where you tongue at, I done that
These young cats'll get thumbtacked and sent where Big Pun at
Smoke so much, the doc asked where my lung at
I took it out to stash my gun, son run that

Pop mega shit, I pop mega clips
Fuck a system, I keep the heat where your Sega sit
Then I bang the controller 'til the game say, ""Over""
In the Bricks, we'll stick ya when ya plane lays over

Yo, we in the place
(Now whut's up?)
DJ, pick up the pace
(Now whut's up?)
Gyrate, feel the bass
(Now whut's up?)
What the deal, huh?
(Now whut's up?)

Yo, y'all know me, maniacs and addicts add it, at it
Venomous addict snake biter, I the, at it
'Cause I'm a little odder at it
In the Ac' with the aircraft and then leave inactive

My alter-ego make niggaz alter their egos
I flow and turn the East coast to one big creep show
South premisy, Filthy-delphia pistol bangers
Pistol changin', pistol bangin'

I lift metal like Lithuanians
Two thousand nail me Sy Scott rap's new insanian
It's humane, punish ya mayn
'Til no skeletal remains remain remain mainly main

To bitten man made disease that's made by man
Crackin' the DNA code to see how God made man
I storm the mainland, scare MC's like slave hands
Put microchips in they wristbands and make 'em rain dance

Lay hands like Mike Strahand
Puttin' ya face and hands in Ace bands
Tryin' to lift more than ya waistband

I travel every shinin' sea, sea and land to finally see
When niggaz land in the error era wherever, forever no error
Easily cut niggaz careers down like ever
Ever forever and ever, don't you ever
Fuck with Sy, Khi and Erick when we come together, what?
",Now Whut's Up,2001
Keith Murray,"Yo rock, cue me in
We, got, that, funk
Murray's, packed, with funk (you need to know)
We, got, the funk for yo' ass (let's go)

[Keith Murray]
Yo, a lot of rappers holler tough stuff, they don't live it
When you hear me emceeing I'm speaking from experience
Keynote speaker, rock funk freaker
This lecture is conducted from the mic and through the speaker
Now who gets weaker, not this dunn
Look I'm never shook down even when, I was on the run
I'm a rebel! I love rebel people!
You're not equal, you damn creep you
I, wake up in the morning with my game face on
And play hard all day, word is bond
By the way whatever happened to, word is bond?
The brother ak lied to me during ramadan
I'm taking no prisoners, takin no shorts
Still drink olde e, cans 40's and quarts
With creativity, and original thought
And a twist of fate I twist your face, don't get caught

[Chorus: Keith Murray]
Yo, we got the ghetto funk, you need to know
Where the funk is at, funk that bump that
Murray's back with that
Funk to make a person catch a heart attack (he's back!)
Yo, we got the ghetto funk, you need to know
Where the funk is at, funk that bump that
Murray's back with that
Funk to make a person catch a heart attack (you need to know)

[Keith Murray]
We, got, funk, for, y'all, stank, ass, c'mon!
Yo, here's, what I'ma do for you
Choke you out 'til your lips and your face turn blue
Oops! now look what you done made me do
I, did it again, and the joke's on you
I'm more than official reputable indisputable
Lyrical phrasologist (you know how I do)
Not one of you or any combination of you
Can ever mess around (boy you know how I do)
Dialectical linguist, unlimited thinker
Descriptive mental photographer
L.o.d. and p.p.p. gets it on
We strong to cause bodily harm to king kong
Stock lock and barrel, empty, reload whoa
This funk here, glocks up, c'mon
I'm not an r&b pop star rock'n'roller
I'm a underground rapper with a chip on my shoulder
You mindless, spineless, jellyfish I eat mc's
which is my favorite dish
I sailed the seven seas, pack 'em in like sardines
And eat fruit right off the stress tree
Keith kill beef like mad cow disease
Spazz on me? negro!
Some say I'm sarcastic, with a bad reputation
But ignore 'em, don't listen, they mr. murray hatin

[Chorus]

[Keith Murray]
This is to my, negroids, spaniels and caucasoids
Even chisel-faced, hardcore, rap be-boys
With my high wire, tightrope, trampoline style
Tear your ass up, with service and a smile
I'm the, local hero, global player
Make your grandmother get up and do the murray rainer
Grab you going to a death row, like an alligator
Good god, my squad got too much flavor
Rainbow style like a pack of now or laters
This funk shit goin' shake the equator
My, squad, stay true to the game
We the trillest mother-effers this side of the grave

[Chorus]",He's Back,2001
Keith Murray,"Breathe it in, breathe it out
Flying high ain't no doubt
I take it to the head yo love
On a ride, in the clouds
Feeling good won't come down
I take it to the head yo love

Stepped in the room I saw you
Instantly knew I had to
Present my game and keep it cool
Wanted so much to kiss you 
To let you know I miss you
I just laid back and let you move

Fronting like you don't want me
Acting like you don't need me
But it's okay that's just your way
There's a physical attraction 
Cause a chemical reaction
So come on boy
Inhale...exhale

The time is right for romance
And I want you for my man
I know you want me for your girl
Baby I know you're willing 
So let's not fight the feeling
Give it to me and rock my world

Don't have to feel you
Just when I'm near 
Where are you at
Get a contact
Got my head spinning
I'm in a whirlwind of your love
And it's got me all choked up",Take It to the Head,2002
Keith Murray,"Fuck the whole industry you tried to get rid of me?
Y'all must be kidding me y'all must be kidding me
Aye yo fuck the whole industry come on
Staten Island come on hold me down
 
Monster cut truck balley shit
Champagne spilling while we hitting every bump that my Denali hit
Outfit is four thousand and better
The rhinestones in my Flintstones look crazy in my sweater
 
Pah it's not a big fairy tale that's my M.O.
Fuck bitches on the reg' with no problemo
Iceberg rabbits and the fox and more
Where I coped two more brought four for RZA
 
Bad Boy thank you for this special delivery
Catch me by the pool in my Tony Starks slippers

In my life
Track Masters
You're all I need in my life
Make money
You're all I need in my life
Duece, duece
You're all I need in my life

Uh huh, yo, yo, yo, yo
I remember in the days 
y'all niggas talking all that shit about keepin' it real
But when it comes to this game I'mma play the field
Rockland  had loot before we signed the deal
Haters get in the way and catch the sky like Seal
We used to use the streets for the football field
In church free lunch was our only meal
But now we push whips with Lorenzo wheels
Living it up in Beverly Hills

[Tone]
You know 9 to 5 was only temporary
Now the ladies want to find Tone in a hurry
Got 'em hittin' notes that Mariah couldn't carry
All you player haters going down like Mary
Cop the Rolls Royce a player with a choice
Ladies stay moist from the sound of my voice
The lady killers pass the keys to our villas
Rockland, Track Masters top billers

[Chorus: x2]
Only the loot can make me happy
(Nothing but the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot)

I never thought that I 
Could make someone like you
I felt energized 
When you went through my groove
I'll never let you go no
You're so right for me
I've got to let you know
Forever you and me
(The balla's anthem right here)

[Chorus]

You must be heaven sent
Sent into my life
And I compliment you honey the money
We have a love that's long 
And true I make you in many ways
I've got to roll with you
In each and every day

[Chorus]

You're all I need in my life
I don't need no one I don't need no one but you
You're all I need in my life
I don't need no one I don't need no one but you
I said you're all I need in my life
I don't need no one I don't need no one but you
You're all I need in my life I don't need no one

Keith Murray,"Yo, the fruit don't fall far from the tree
Yeah, uh

My grandfather use to tell me
This place ain't got nothing to offer you
Don't you see all the changes everybody going through
This family got problems and they do too
But everybody wanna tell you what they think you should do
He said watch them so called friends and them girls too
Sonny do you like they did Jesus crucify you
As he sat there in his chair looking out the window
I'm thinking when you can't get away where do you go?
(Inside your mind) man child never had a chance to be young
Either you selling drugs or out there on the binge strung for some
There's only two places to go the morgue or the Pen
For some school is an option entertainment to alternate them
Then they'll try to exploit you discriminate you
Use you as a tool make money and live in luxury off you
And we so confused we wanna believe in something
So they promise us the world but give us nothing

I say we can be all in this together
Yeah, will you end up like, your family tree
Tell me what you gonna do what you gonna do
What you gonna do
Your mind ain't too far from the sky

The death of a loved one remind you of yourself don't it?
Knowing you could be next at any given moment
Like Twine I used to call him a brother of mine
His pops was a drunk and his mother was blind
He use to stay at my hose sometimes my moms didn't mind
We was just nickel and dime hustlers wasting time
Living in the streets targeted and forced to kill
Dualistically we learned how to lie and steal
Gangsters of the future modern days thugs
Seem like me whole hood is covered in blood
Traveling a ruff life in the eye of the storm
Now I wear their life stories tattooed on my arm
Psyc's grandmother passed away on April fools day
Then her funeral was on her birthday shit is real
My man had four baby moms and two on the way
And trying to make a living for them passes away in vein
God bless him, ask Skeeta

Child of the streets well, well, well, well
Will you end up like your family tree?
Tell me what you gonna do 3X
(Child of the streets, understand the habits
Behind the child of the streets)

They try to fuck my fame up tear my name up
Turn around and sue me fuck my little bit of change up
I knew it was going to be some shit to get me for some cream
I saw it in my subconscious world like a vision
At first it hurt me like a knife in the heart
But by nature I continued to live out my part
As art imitates life and life imitates art
Don't respect the streets and they tear your ass apart
It's important that my understanding understood
But it's more important that it's understood in the hood
And to all the females in the Pen stay strong
Any day in jail girl is a day too long
And for those who had to do what they did to slide
Now running like a fugitive to save the live you live
Put in a box saw my step pops
He said boy Keith what the blood clot how much time you got?

Child of the streets little sister
Tell me where will you lay your head?
Child of the streets little brother
Where will you make your bed?
Y'all tell me what y'all gonna do
What y'all gonna do
Tell me what y'all gonna do
Tell me",Child of the Streets (Man Child),2003
Keith Murray,"Yeah, this the build up, oh no, you knew we was coming back
But you ain't know we was coming back like this

Yeah, uh huh, Keith Murray, uh huh, Def Jam, yeah, Def Squad
Keith Murray gon' make you go uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, Def Squad gonna make you go ah, ooh, ooh, ah

I come on stomping mud holes in tracks like Timbaland
The producer and the booth, niggas so don't get cute
I come through in the coupe with the chopped off roof
Humiliate you then blast you in your birthday suit

You a small side order of apple cider
I'm a three hots in a cot dungeon rider
My hardcore street team crash the party with Def Jam
And incorporate murda like Gotti

How about in back of the yellow cab like Seinfeld
Chew you like little neck clams on half shells
I got a hypochondriac flow that get real ill
Get nauseous to the beat, I spit sick at will

And the time has come and your shit is sour
You need to turn your flow up an hour
Give you a permanent lean, like the Pisa Tower
With a hoes that will wet you down like a cold shower

Yo we got the shit on lock, uh huh
Come through and blast the spot, yeah man
And my name is the record, so check it, when I put it on record
Everybody say, ""Oh, my goodness""

If you love what I'm doing holla back, talk to me
And when I step on the scene, a lean mean wrecking machine
Everybody scream, ""Oh, my goodness""

And yeah, I hear you talking motherfucker write the check
And if you in the house then protect your neck
I'm 'Mister see you anywhere it's gon' be a showdown'
So ya'll better have lyrics when I come 'round

Cause I ain't lost a battle since God knows when
Some niggas tried to front but they gots no win
Taught how to prevent to lose and handle the win
Like birds are made to fly and fish made to swim

Wait a minute, homie you don't really know me, homie
I'll take you to a picnic boy you lunch meat
With my dazzling appearance and my world wide clearance
I am treacherous, inferior, impermanent, impetuous

I rock like an archaeologist
Draw a picture like a forensic artist, perform like a dramatist
I'm fabulously wicked, miraculous
Rustic, majestic, ridiculous, oh, my goodness

Yo we got the shit on lock, uh huh
Come through and blast the spot, yeah man
And my name is the record, so check it, when I put it on record

And you in line motherfucker like them people in court
So when I see you I'm a pop your top like a cork
I pack flow like ammo, spit like camels
Come through and bless your whole crew like achoo

But some still wanna holla, pop they collar
Fucking with me like I run a funeral parlor
Linguist, lyricist out for chips like Estrada
Bilingual emcees even couldn't even couldn't do me nada

With this mic I'm handy, flows be dandy
It's a full moon and hoes wanna fuck like Brandy
Yeah, I've been hated on, you probably heard it
And I kicked their little ass but them niggas deserved it

And I'm still in the hood and I still rep the hood
Still tee'ing off for a long green like Tiger Woods
I ain't even gotta say it, ya'll know when it's hot
So ya'll go back up in the vocal box

Yo we got the shit on lock, uh huh

Meet the villain with a thousand faces
I'll stab you up in a thousand places
I might catch you with a blade or a rap
Cause it's always more than one way to skin a rat
Them young boys fucking up hip hop
We've always been original get your own props
I show up in boots to your black tie affair
And physically put this funk up in your ear
I got friends in all the low places that keep me high
And we be up all night just like the red eye
I never sleep like nueva york
Miss me with all that body waste she's talking
Hit me with your best shot fire away
I'm da super easy minded MC OK!
I'm skin tight and knee deep shit
So long on you both my feet fall asleep

So it comes as no surprise
Nigga you snooping around like a private eye
But idiot the victory is mine
Ya niggaz can't chew gum and walk at the same time

With enough energy to make a car start

You a savage kid you might as well run around with a pet pig
I see a ugly chick and she's scoping
And I'm like got damn who left the gate open
Most prominent and dominant
shittin like I'm like lactose intolerant
Meanwhile I hopped the turnstile
with the L. O. D. Ichbabod Crane style
I stepped into some shit them wiped it with my hand
See that's what makes me who I am, goddamn
No if and buts or maybes
Yo! E this shit is crazy baby

OH! That's how it is, that's how you living

Yeah but she's a picture post card pretty fat kitty little bitty, who!
You're provoking me, giving me the notions
To make me want to lick your funky emotions
She can make a crippled man walk and a blind man see
How can I put this? hmm
She can make the Grinch love Christmas
How can I manifest her uniqueness in vernacular?
(Like a chocolate candy bar) yeah that describes her

[Chorus: x4]

(She looks like a)
I seen her at the park on the black top watching the kids play
Hey style complimented the sunny day
There's a mild nature about her
Gentle but firm for all the bullshit life brought her way
You reflected beauty of a starless night by far
Like Billy Joel said ""I take you just the way you are!""
I had a crush on you since the days of love tap
Karate shoes you had jelly cornrows with the peas in the back
I knew you'd grow to be a fine specimen someday
You the very inspiration for the song I sing
The way you sprint the runway and scale the catwalk
Your life is a movie and the camera's never off
It's like love at first taste, coming deep from within
From your DNA structure to your whole body ova
Your beauty is respected in the eye of the beholder
I love that little chocolate bar tattered on your shoulder

[Chorus: x4]

(She looks like a)
Oh yeah the time is now and the place is here
So come a little closer let me kick it in your ear
And share this wit you girl you super official
I just want to bite you girl you look good like a Snickers
Ooh la la, ah wee wee, walking by looking all like I Ecstasy
Got doe ma didn't know, good gracious alive!
Aw shuck now, there she go
Hey yo come and rest your feet my little chocolate soufflet
I know you're tired you been running through my mind all day
And Oh My Goodness! can I get a witness?
This roundy brownie is something to see
I never had a craving like this before, I'm addicted
Lord have mercy! please give me strength!
Dark, rich and thick like a fresh baked cake
Just thinking of your shape girl I catch a tooth ache

Keith Murray,"Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Yo the streets is hungry - word
Its time to eat most definitely
Grab ya plate
Get ya knives and ya forks yea
Keith Murray Get ready

Yo as I look out at the high rise
And right about my life into the sunrise
Lookin' at the smoke where the twin towers stood
Forty blocks away forty stories high I could see it good
But we been at war and under attack
We got P.O.W.s fightin' to get back in jail
And these affected by the poverty war
We pack gats frontline and will endure
I go to bed with god and wake up with the devil
In a battle I blacked out and beat a man with a shovel
Its obligatory that you hear my side of the story
He had the face a fear, shakin' like a leaf on a tree
You just another potential casualty
This is a walkin' corpse song and the beat is your conspiracy theory
And the time is getting more scary
So pack when necessary and say your L.O.D. Hail Marys

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Yo I'm eye of a tiger inside the head of a liar
Give 'em pure hell brimstone and fire
This is MC cannibalism by connoisseur
From the lyrical lexicon matador of metaphor
Yo from the little voice in my conscience
I might just leave your fuckin' ass unconscious
Yea I seen you wit with that smirk on
You little fuckin' clown I turn that smile into an upside down frown
Produce chaos in the culture of the enemy
You will never posses the skills to defeat me
I be the all eye seein' you hear it sporadic
I rhyme at will be on your ass automatic
With thoughts of power I rain thunder showers
I eat a lot of brain food and you'll get devoured
Man hunt chase of the night stalker off da leash walker
My dog is a fire barker

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Yo from the instinctual coming of the insect
To the mind of a genius and the heart of a prophet
To them bootlegged niggas and the chicks that cop it
Ask anyone they know how the fuck drop it
And coastin' constant motion essential
With fusion nuclear potential
You hear a cold whisper you see da mask of a phantom acts wailin'
Deranged assailant
I tame the rage, isolate, chase and kill my prey
Walk the lion outta da cage
And that's a part of life or should I say death
Reach in your mouth snatch out ya very last breath
Searchin' my subconscious for the meaning
I'm sweatin' blood bullets cause my whole world is bleedin'
Ooh now check how I come at you
I will eat you defeat you I'm parasitical

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

There's no where you can run
No way to hide
The world is a cage and we all locked inside
So you might as well fight to survive
Yea yea

Keith Murray,"I'm always getting shitted on son, ain't gonna be no, no different
Can you accept me as I am? I ask you
Always, the love lords? I need you
Can you open your heart to mine and accept me and all my faults
During the human course activity, watch me give me my room
I am radiant, give me my space, I am light

[Verse 1]
Yo, 2/27/98 I wrote a check out
to H.W. funeral home for my little sister Christina
15 years old damn man this fuckin world is so cold
8 months before I had to do three years
Coming from the air port my face burning with tears
I had this black cloud hovering over me
Far back as I can check back down my family tree
Its been with me since my first LP
2nd LP I was sittin in court
3rd LP I was trapped in the belly of the beast, got it back to the streets
by the power of the mind and positive of light
some say livin is death and dying is life
I say pray for me that I should be born tonight
I remember roaming the streets in those cold winter nights
Look at me this is my life

[Chorus]
Suddenly my life feels so alone, tell me what the hell is going on
Tell me, tell me, why my life feels so alone, so wrong
Tell me what the hell is going on
Help me, please help me

[Verse 2]
I can't even begin to explain the mental anguish
I went through as a child when I heard my pops had passed
I went to see him on the sick bed
with my grandmother, that day I knew it was the last
I loved him but I had to grow up without him
Over the years I've lived through frustrations and questions
In 90' I went to jail as an adolescent
Then in 92' my moms had to go back to the essence
Got me thinkin about the meaning of my existence (I lost my best friend)
I realised the devil was spying on my from a distance
He don't want me to receive my blessings he fear me
My family suffered more deaths then the Kennedy's
This is real and if you don't believe me ask someone that grew with me
Know them and feel my energy
Please never fabricated nor duplicated so I ask you
Can you open you hearts and minds and receive me with all my faults
Can you open your hearts and minds unconditionally to begin to understand my cause
Hey yo this world is a pool of sharks
But I'm the animal right when I stand up for myself and bark
And this year I gotta go all out for it
I've been hustlin for 13 years, nothin to show for it (I mean nothin)
Lookin over my bills damn they eaten me up
Entertainment task force watchin so what the fuck
I paid my taxes too fuck you and your uncle
The laws of nature will see me through
And yeah I peep it and naw it ain't no secret
How niggaz give their word with no intentions to keep it
I'm givin you the roots of the real
My emotional feelings bi-polar is how I feel

[Chorus]",Christina,2003

Right jab like Zab Zuda
Every member on my team is the shooter
Tight like a womb, no room for intruders
Spark Buddha, twistin' the Philly
And Good Humor, don't be silly
It's gravy baby, I got it all smothered
Like makeup, I got it all covered
Want a jewel, don't be cruel
It's authentic, don't be fooled
By these phony accusations
Backlash and slanders
Front, and they put pits in ya
Stunts and propaganda
Keep it private, 'cause I'm the commander

Gimme a break, I might shake the building place

Kid you sonned out, let me speak to your father
Matter of fact, hold these here, and don't even bother

Keith Murray,"Brother remember, remember what momma used to say
We'll get over it, we won't stay under it

[Chorus]
Momma wasn't rich (unh uh) my dady was poor (uh huh)
I couldn't take no more (I had to get my hustle on)
Momma wasn't rich (unh uh) my dady was poor (uh huh)
I couldn't take no more (I had to get my hustle on)
Momma wasn't rich (unh uh) my dady was poor (uh huh)
I couldn't take no more (I had to get my hustle on)
Momma wasn't rich (unh uh) my dady was poor (uh huh)
I couldn't take no more (I had to get my hustle on)

Growin' up I ain't never had nothin'
Had to get out in the streets and get myself somethin', feel me
Chillin' with the Legion of Doom at an early age
Watchin' all the older niggas in the hood get paid
Yo I knew I could get it if I wanted to
Cause I lived on the corner where all the base heads came through
So it was only write that I get me just do B
Shit, I ain't choose hustlin', hustlin' chose me
This my block, I live here I sell drugs here
Let a nigga come through and slit my throat
I dare I swear, I got the tre eight in the tree
And the guage is right over there! Where?
In the bushes for you douches with one eye out
A nigga keep lookin'
For the police and them base heads juxin'
Shit, I looked for a job, but that ain't last long
I couldn't take it any more
I had to get my hustle on

[Chorus]

Now I'm addicted to Carlton Ave servin' the hood
My basketball coach told my moms and that ain't good
I'd hide when she slide through every chance I could
She said ""Boy I see you tryin' to get back over in them woods
Wher u get the new sneakers from I know I ain bought 'em""
I told her ""[? ] my uncle Tejuan bought 'em""
I grew up around hustlers, she knew I'd try it
She asked me was I doin' it you know I denied it
But I was tired
I wanted what I wanted when I wanted it
Fuck the consequeces I knew just how get
Cop that, cook that, chop that, pitch that
Save that, get stacks, fresh kicks, new hat
[? ] new rules, more smoke, more loot
Have crack, get dough, just like rap
Baseheads came back for the hit
My neighbors lookin' 'cause of the traffic
Man, but fuck that shit

[Verse 1: Keith Murray]
Keith Murray, the lyrical hannibal floe cannibal
Animalistic tough guy man handle you
I came into this b*tch my style hardcore
Then I heard a hater say he ain't fire no more!
What?! That was me standin on your block with the razor blade
In my mouth back when hip hop was hip hop
For those who don't know or forget
To make y'all happy with Mary J. who Puff came to get (Me)
Then who called for Total to make y'all see (Me)
Then who he called again for Special Delivery (That a be me)
There's nothin you could tell me, I rocked every hole in the wall
Then arena to arena with R. Kelly
Who made you feel beautiful while gettin lifted (Me)
I rocked bells with L you must be stupid
I don't need no permission, to do what I do
Come through and show the whole world how I do

[Verse 2: Keith Murray]
And who you know get out of jail and get them figures
Get back into the game like f**k the system
Hit the studio and bless y'all with Fatty Girl
Who got 'em sayin ba donk a donk around the world
Now I'm hearin I got anger issues on the street
The only anger I got, is when I'm f**kin up a E beat
Keep runnin your lips and I'm a have you dancin like the crips
Turn your six pack to some barbeque rib tips
Mother hot damn this man jam like a phone
And plus the sh*t I get more draws than a dresser 
When I flow, there's no one deafer
Make you make the ugly face like Lamont's Aunt Ester
You can't stealth me my tank is too healthy
Even negative situations help me
When E lace the beat, and me and Ty bust one
Trust son that's money in the bank like a trust fund

[Chorus: Tyrese] 
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better (Can't nobody)
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
I'm gonna be right here to get your shit together

[Verse 3: Keith Murray]
Yo! Keith Murray is your (?) MC Ultra
With the sickest comeback like ni**a I told ya
Honeys sweat me like conversation, mind affiliation
House niggas like the Fannie Mae Foundation
The K don't play f**k around touche' and toupee
What you say get done away like Faye
I rhyme flagrant you sweeter than a sugar fragrance
Ignoramus, blow your brains out on a pavement 
The game we been milkin for awhile like a green cow
You seregant MC, that ain't your style
Metaphors dawn on you in time like revelations
Battlin Keith, self mutilation
Let it be sensible, I'll make you invisible
Ni**as can't see me the flow is invincible
My style royalty like residuals
You subjectable, hospitable y'all niggas is despicable

[Chorus: Tyrese] 
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better (Can't nobody)
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
I'm gonna be right here to get your shit together

Clip out the gold glock, pimp out the whole spot
Sell out the whole stock - stop sleepin' on me
Motherfuckers, wake up, last stop
And I don't play games, y'all dudes is Tetris

Hood down, car kinda loud from the muffler
Like DAMN when I profile at the Rucker
Bitches (Got Game), I'm (Above the Rim)
Call my gun Magnolia Soulja Slim
Do ""The Freak"" on the floor, two steps to the side
Talk greasy like Popeye's breast and a thigh
I got sour diesel roll
One hit of this bitch, your whole staff is (out of control) {""Ohh!""}
I'm programmed for winnin, Sean John to denim
Fly guy got shoes with fish in water swimmin
You pointed me out, bad guy with the mouth
I'm Oscar, no wonder muh'fucker I'm a (Grouch)
I work around dirt, eyes focused on turf
You tried to hide before your NexTel chirp!
Blaow gotcha, you the best nigga call the doctor
Like Chinese tryin to salsa
It's never gonna be in (Groove), call Stella back
Holiday Inn 'em, then back in the shuttle van
Bitch give me head on the first date, what a fan
Three best MC's I think on the other hand
Stand like an officer, not a gentleman
Niggaz get rich off of stolen car settlements!

I ain't par tomorrow but the E is connected
Look what happens when you spin the records
Hip-Hop at its best, nothin to mess with (yeah)
I'm right here, there's no need to download
I attract hoes, I ain't gotta hound those

Cut the check at 40 grand for shows
I'm (Fresh) like Doug E., I show ya
The beat got it (Clap) like them boys from 'Nolia, I told ya
Yeah, I do it real big by a coat check
With no bling-bling around my neck, yup

I ain't a Blood, but I'll throw you out the whip (word up)

With a mean street team outside posted up
Toasted up, ready to roast a duck (uh-huh)
When I say street team, I don't mean niggaz that put posters up (word)
Let's be blatant, you achin and ancient
We capered in your hood with dirty machetes and bloody aprons
I'll acquire a tec, quiet your rep
Stay quiet as deaf, or Kanye's choir rep (uh-huh)
As I make another left, quiet I crept, quiet you slept
I'm back with the tec, like I never left (surprise niggaz!)
See frivolous beef'll get you curiously shot (uh-huh)
You fuckin with Keith, I think seriously not (hell no)

Keith Murray,"Yeah
Something has to be said
Uh
Somebody tell me something
Whats up?

That it's on right now and we about to let off
And that the industry is sleepin' and Hip Hop is soft
EPMD is the boss like Rick Ross
We don't knock or ring or else we kick down the door with force
Bust you down, leave a sign on you that say you lost
Game over, no more quarters, plus the machine is broke
Money don't really remember nothing, all he has seen is smoke
No witness, no statement, no case
Incorporate you eat cheese, then you get a raise
Rubbed out return to the earth
Six feet deep in the dirt
With the snakes and maggots cause you got murked

Yeah, and they keep telling me that
You're only as good as your last record
And if I was to do something now they wouldn't second
Hardcore respect it and that is enough
You got more props then call your bluff
Same thing happened to Marry and Mariah
They both came back with fire, fuck retiring
I got belts around my waist
You keep holding your pants up
Homeboy male up!
That's your opinion, cause you're not feeling it
How you know they're hot the fans not hearing it
The record pins steering it in one direction
You, there is some music in the real niggas section

That EPMD is a corporation it's not its the group
And that they always stack paper so put up your loot
Ghetto celebs that's why niggaz salute
Orange juice and grey goose
We dramatic backwards now that P is loose
Me and E is back for the kill, no troops
That's why we spit the real in the vocal booth

Yeah so called gangster and you ain't even hard
So called boxer and you ain't even sport
When them ribber hit you got punked in the yard
You said you got shot and you ain't even scarred
But they believe this and you keep betraying them
You are a bitch and I'm not the only one saying it

Now he from the BX but he really soft
And he from BK but his guns don't go off
He from cop killer Queens but he still getting robbed
And he from money making but he ain't on his job
Now he from LA but he's scared to bang
And he from Texas but he will do the damn thing
He'd stay in VA but he is scared of the streets
And he's from Chi-a but he's sweet as a peach
I can tell you 'bout the dope fiends and all of that

But I let them tell it 'cause they sell their moms crack
And that ain't gangsta that is wanksta
Went to jail and the homo shanked ya
Don't get caught between my city and the moon
You'll be screaming at night, you loose your life at me to doom
I really hung with BIG, squared off with Pac
Shook hands in the House of Blues before the shit popped
First fought niggaz in the industry and kept it cool
You ain't see me running my mouth in no interviews
And you fools on them DVD's waving tools
No that ain't something that a gangsta do",They Tell Me,2008

And let my balls hang like I'm on a toilet takin a shit
My style is all that, and a big bag of chips wit the dip
Fuck all that sensuous shit
I represent intellectual violence
And leave your click holier than the Ten Commandments
Like Redman I shift with the ruck
If ya if was a spliff we'd be all fucked up (Word up!)
No need to ask you who is he, Son I get busy
Scuff my Timbs on the boulevard of many ruff cities (Chicago, LA, any of them)
I'll have to Norman Bate ya I love ta hate ya
Cause you'se a freak by nature
Can't wait to face ya, mutilate ya
Drink your style down straight wit no chaser (Word up!)
My verbal combat's like a mini-Mac to your back
As soon as one of you niggaz try to over react
The L.O.D. love good confrontation or vamp (Word up!)
Break your concentration, murder your camp
For the jealous, overzealous, we fellas
Blow the the spot like Branford Marsalis

Y'all commercial niggas better have a Coke and a smile

Yo, I conversate wit many men, it's time to begin again
Forgot what I already knew, hey yo you hear me friend?
Illuminati want my mind, soul, and my body
Secret society, trying to keep they eye on me
But I'm stay incogni', in places they can't find me
Make my moves strategically, the G.O.D.
It's sorta similar but iller than a chess player
I use my thinker, it coincides with my blinker
While you wondered what we saying on the records real
Yeah you motherfucking right kid you know the deal
My Mobb is Infamous just like the fucking title read
You get back slapped so hard make ya nose bleed
Some, kids feeling guilty bout the,
But you first baby girl so just face it (alright)
But anyway, back on the real side of things
My niggas sling cracks and wear fat diamond rings
Not only is it inside the songs that we sing (kid)
Everything is real not just a song that we sing (word up, it's real)
From my life to the paper (what), very accurately
Give you all of my two so maybe you can three
Prodigy will forever will S-H-I-N-E (shine baby, just shine)
My shit attract millions like the moon attract the sea
How dare you ever in your life walk past me
Without acknowledging this man as G-O-D
I shot ya fagot ass

Now who the fuck you think you talking to, I pay dues I spray crews
Look I'm Joey Crack, motherfuckers be like he's bad news
Running this racket, from New York to Montego
Slaughtering people, bring a ton of keys from Puerto Rico
I'd rather be feared than loved because the fear lasts longer
These bitch ass niggas know we stronger
Than these weaklings, seeking, for respect that ain't there
Knuckleheads beware, there's mad tension in the air
Tommy guns for fun, shotties for block parties
While fresh lead heats up your insides like a fifth of Bacardi
Call the ambulance, this man's wet
Bullets cut him down from the root up just like a Gillette
Razor, which I keep hidden in my oral
Ready to spatter, at any ad out, that wants to quarrel
These feds want me for some tax evasion
Now that the fact that somebody's getting lucci that's not Caucasian
Bullets be blazing through these streets filled with torture (what the deal pop)
Joey Crack, a.k.a. Kaiser Ceaser

Thug niggas give they minks to chinks
To' down we sip drinks rockin minks, 
Flashing rings and things (what the deal)
Fronting hardcore deep inside the Jeep, macking
Doing my thing fly nigga you a Scarface king
Bitches grab ya ta-ta's, get them niggas for they cheddar
Fuck it, Gucci sweaters and Armani leathers
Flossing rocks like the size of Fort Knox
Four carats, the ice rocks, pussy banging 
Like Versace locs pops (what the deal)
Want ta the creep, on the light raw ass cheeks
I'm sexing raw dog without protection, disease infested
Italiano got the Lucciano

To lay low, I play slow

What the fuck? I thought I conquered the whole world
Crushed Moe Dee, Hammer, and Ice-T's girl
But still, niggas want to instigate shit
I'll battle any nigga in tha rap game quick
Name the spot, I make it hot for ya bitches
Female rappers too, I don't give a fuck boo
Word, I'm here to crush all my peers
Rhymes of the month in The Source for twenty years
Niggas scared, I'm detrimental to your mental state
I use my presidential Rolex to be debate
Niggas fight, glock cocked ya temple gets fucked
MC's, that fuck with LL they gets bucked
That's real, what's up with that I Shot Ya deal?
Light shit, niggas slip now how the bullet feel?
New York appeal, in L.A. they gang bang
But if you touch a mic your motherfucking ass hang
That's facts, niggaz don't receive no type of slack
Cause if they do, they ass is always running back
Not this time, but next time I'ma name names

When I was bumping ""Roxanne, Roxanne""
I got gin and an O.J.
Rock 'Friday' to 'next Friday' like O'Shea
Hit the west coast, six four on tray
Doctor Bombay, sick flow all day
I don't play fair, niggas can't see me
That's why I make it do what it do, baby, yeah
You want some, yeah, niggas hit the floor
When I kick in the door, wave in the four four
For sure, Uncle Snoop, where's the coupe?
'Cause I keep a hoe fighting like New York and Hoopz
Strap up your boots, move around
Pick it up like engine number nine
It's mine, homey, Tech, what's good?
And it ain't hard to tell how I rep my hood
You a beast like me, rep your hood
Sign the check when I mic check, one-two

[Chorus]
West Coast niggas love getting it started
Down South niggas love getting it started
East Coast niggas love getting it started
But when we in the house shit get retarded
When we in the house shit get retarded
When we in the house shit get retarded
We came to finish what ya'll done started
""Everybody just scream!""

Aiyo, fuck your prognosis on who's the dopest
You get skate like super chronic holitosis
If you looking for beef, you know you gon' get it
Got ya'll niggas yellin' 'callin' the cops, get the paramedics'
Keith Murray, Method Man, Redman
Hip hop got Barack in his be-Boy stance
Like a nigga with no legs, you don't stand a chance
Against the Wu-Tang, Def Squad, L.O.D. wardance
One glance, watch Keith Murray hop out
In a hurry, cold like a McFlurry
No Mickey D's, show me the money like Jerry Maguire
L.O.D. for hire, I'm ready
I rep Strong Island, bums get rushed
I pack house like Biggie in Notorious
We warriors, who the fuck are you?
I pop an E and the gun go Pikachu
Niggas know how deep the crew, get at me
I'm nasty, but I went from ashy to classy
Got badunkadunks waving all at me
'Cause I be, doing my thing and making everybody scream

[Chorus]

Yo, Brick City, Staten, Long Island, we back
More violent on the track, black talent and a gat
Bomb shit, like a nigga wilding in Iraq
See the truth of the fact, niggas lying in they raps
Me? I'm a diamond in the rough in the cut
Like paroxide, got mine frying in the Dutch
Forget about your top 5, try and top mines
Take shine like I got mine ironing your guts
You know I keep it fired up, fire in the hole
To the game, old and tired, I be tired when I'm old
I'm trying to keep it hot like the pile up in the stove
While these rappers losing power putting powder in they nose
Meth, Keith Murray and Redman, yo
Fuck you and your mama on a headband, hoe
You can call the kid a modern day Van Gogh
Take the art to a place where the fake can't go
My chain and my pants hang low
Got my own namebrand, I'm the man made, bro
Cash in advance, I'mma blow up with the dough
Whoa ho ho, don't let me like slow up with flow

The east to the west 
Up north to the down south 
Live wires connect 
So if you swangin' on thangs 
(Keith Murray, UGK and oh my Lord Jamar) 
Or down to gangbang, or waitin' on the train 
It's still the same thang 

You cut your mind and your body with the rhyme and the shotty 
Go and find me or hidin', with wine and Bacardi 
Get down like John Gotti then I gotta get lost 
I'm gone in the wind 
My momma keep on tellin' me there's Bun in the sin 
I guess I'm hell-bound destined 
To learn my lesson, sess in my chestin' 
It burn but I keep on puffin, no bluffin' 
They don't call me Big Bun for nothin' 
No homeboys you come dead, well put em to rest 
Bumba clocks em all dead, wit two in his chest 
Botty bwoy you come dead, and if in all die 
Will you run dead em again? Well go on buddy let em fly 
That's how it is in my city, and your city 
Sir it gets no prettier just more gritty per capita, all around 
From the five boroughs on down to the mighty Bro town 

[Chorus]

Now watch this current rock it current for a sentence 
For a triple homicide, cripple any drama that reside in the mind 
Of those livin' outside of my state line 
Let em know we all the same kind 
With the same crimes, catchin' the same time, which translates to hang time 
Organized gangs slangin' dime 
Lord Jamar is black G-zuz, I sees this 
Everywhere I go, brothers hustlin' to make the doe 
Fast or slow, ya want to see your cash grow 
Like grass, but meanwhile take a blast of the el 
And let the smell resonate, never hesitate 
When it comes to puttin' food on your plate 
Devise schemes by all means 
Like a sunrise when it beams, keep your eyes on the cream 
Live wires on the team Connect, get respect for they realness 
I know you feel this 

[Chorus]

Uhh, now who that tryin ta claim they be thumpin' 
That's only when your funky little fake tape be bumpin' 
You can catch a square and get done unfair 
Because aah, I'll be there, I'll be right there 
Cocoa butter, got that, make em all for 
Real life hustler movie maker, I know how y'all feel 
But long as I'm alive I'ma do the right thing 
And block out this stress my past criminal life might bring 
The only way I use to nip it in the bud 
Was ta try and put some bullets in some of you joker's guts 
I got victims, G it ain't about the face you make 
It's all about the place you take between yourself and snakes 
Now everybody open up your arms for the cocoa- 
Mr.Former Football Player-ex drug dealer-gold digger-
Killer with scrilla, they be missin' me with the bomb breakin' 
'Cause I gets busy like no cornwheat 

[Chorus]

I'm tryin' ta stack paper, these pigs can't stand me 
It's all about my family, it's all about my candy 
It's all about the crush, all about the feelin' good 
All about the rush, all about us, the first family 
Somethin' that a young fool never really planned to be 
But funny situations, do bring change 
And young fools do out here in this wicked game 
That's how I'm gon' starve when fools eatin' steak 
Man, I can't stop now, too much money out here to make 
Now you could turn your nose up and you can suck your teeth 
But I gotta get this money, ain't nobody gonna get it for me 
And I might have to do shady things 
Stick up kid all out, no shame 
Run your rings, ear ring in change 
Don't make me give it to ya 'cause it ain't no thang 
I do it for the glory man, cuff the thangs 
I gotta let em hang, I'm stuck in '87 tryin' to regain my brain 
Too many undercovers know my name 
A phone line like fire 'cause I'm a live wire

Who is this with malicious onslaughts? 
Keith Murray, UGK and oh my Lord Jamar 
And we bustin' on all you losers 
Ridin' twenty-deep in two black Land Cruisers 
Recognize or get paralyzed with the drum 
Where I'm from they promise you a fair one, then blast you with the gun 
And everybody standin' around like it's funny 
Junior L.O.D pickin' your pockets for your money 
The checkered, I slide off and make a funky record about it 
No more than four minutes and some seconds 
And live wire connected, from my peoples on the street who respect it 
And the jeeps, hoopties, Benz and Lexus 
My squad stretches from New York to Portland to Texas 
Let's see who's next to test this 
Some herbs, ready to get their heads served 
To the hard curb

Keith Relf,"Diamonds of silvery rain in the fountains
And ten-cent red roses from department store counters
Watching the moonlight reflect off the river
Beside where the trains cross the bridge and slow down
Trains with white letters on black iron sides
And white rushing water that all rolls away
And Little Miss Someone does not want to stay
Everyone's moving, with places to go
And Mr. Zero, he sadly stands still
As the water goes one way, the train goes another
Mr. Zero stands still, and Miss Someone don't bother

Yesterday's kiss will be cold by tomorrow
As campfires of midnight dissolve in the darkness
The room is deserted, the blinds have been drawn
Little Miss Someone has packed up and gone
Fast moving cars disappear down the highway
With signs that say ""hitch-hikers, do not disturb""
Mr. Zero looks quietly up from the curb
Morning has faded, and shadows have grown
And Little Miss Someone is on her way home
Mr. Zero stands watching, her plane flies above
And with frost-bitten hands, waves goodbye to his love

Walks through the park on a bright summer Sunday
And tapestry kittens that hung on the wall
They all die in the air like a soft minor chord
A vacancy sign and a bulletin board
Mr. Zero is wrapping his jacket around him
Speaking kind words that should have been said long ago
But Little Miss Someone does not want to know
The night is deserted, there's dust on the shelf
Mr. Zero sits lonely and talks to himself
It's too late to change, the fine line has been crossed
The charades are all done, Mr. Zero has lost",Mr. Zero [Performed by Keith Relf -- Solo Single],1966

Linger a while on the lies

This song was written in a hotel room in New York City
Right about the time a friend of ours, Little Steven
Was putting together a record of artists against apartheids
It's a song written about a man in a shanty town outside of Johannesburg
A man who's sick of looking down the barrel of white South Africa
A man who is at the point where he is ready to take up arms against his oppressor
A man who has lost faith in the peace makers of the West
While they argue and while they fail to support a man like Bishop Tutu
And his request for economic sanctions against South Africa

If I ain't dead already
Ohhh girl you know the reason why.

The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bone
I feel so sucidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones

Lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ohhh girl you know the reason why.

Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so sucidal
Even hate my rock and roll

Want to die
Yeah
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ohhh girl you know the reason why.",Yer Blues,1991

Then at first what they said didn't hurt me
Until they mentioned her name
Then slowly the tears overtook me

Screaming she moans, ""I've just been made""
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
Says, ""My advice is to not let the boys in""

He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
""Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it's not poison""

Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
Saying, ""Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?""

Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry""
And dropping a bar bell he points to the sky
Saving, ""The sun's not yellow it's chicken"" Chorus

The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
Put jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves

With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle

'Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
At Delilah who sits worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter

I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after

[Chorus]

Where Ma Raney and Beethoven once unwrapped their bed roll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college

Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle",Introduction,2000
Keith Rowe,"If it's love that you're running from, there's no hiding place.
You can't run it, you can't hide it, you can't run it
Love has problems I know but there problems, we'll just have to face.
If you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
We're gonna walk and don't look back. 
Don't look back
And don't look back
And don't look back, baby. 
Don't look back

The places behind you let them re-remind you
If your first lover broke your heart,
There's something that can be done.
You don't run it, you don't hide it, you don't run it
Don't end your faith in love because of what he's done.
So if you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
Keep on walking and don't look back.
Forget about the past now.
Don't look back, baby.
Keep on walking and don't look back
The places behind you let them re-remind you.

Love can be a beautiful thing.
Though your first love let you down.
'Cause I know we can make love bloom, baby.
The second time around.
So if you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
Keep on pushing and don't look back.
Now, till I say, we won't look back, girl.
Keep on walking and won't look back.
Forget about the past now, baby.
And don't look back.
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't look back.",Don't Look Back,

Now you say you're sorry

I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river

How can we face adversity?

How can we stand in the midst of trouble when the enemy laughs at our beliefs

There is no way out.

Christ is singing in you then the song that you sing will never end

(Why me, baby) What did I do, girl, what did I do
(Why, why me, baby)
You broke my heart

Check this out, honey
It seems like 99 years have gone by
Since the last time I talked to you, you know
I never realized that somethin` so innocent and so sweet
Could make a man feel so much pain
Times you`d jump out of my car and I`d chase you till I was out of breath
Go to your job and pick you up
But you never showed up that day
Where were you, baby
Who was you seein`, it`s a hurtin` feelin`, sugar
How could you, why would you abuse my love, sweetheart
Cursin` me out in front of my friends
And I could never do anything to you
'Cause there was no way I could hurt somethin` I treasured so much
Thought I was right on time, but it seems like I was too late
You hurt me, baby
But hey, I`m man enough to admit it
What I want to know is why

(Why, why me, baby) {Tell me why, baby, tell me why}
(Why, why me, baby) Tell me, baby
(Why, why me, baby) Tell me, baby
You broke my heart, baby {Check this out}
(Why)

Yo`, the way it happened was crazy
We had a argument
I didn`t see you for two or three days
And then when I go to the movies to get you off my mind
I see you sittin` there holdin` hands with the next man
Caught you on the phone a couple of times, but it was always your cousin
Step off, just a friend
People used to tell me, ¡°L, she was fakin`¡±
But I couldn`t see it, I was blinded by love
Nothin` was too expensive
No night was too rainy
I was always there for you
I did things few call me a fool for doin`
Droppin` your friends off, all that
All I wanted in return was your undivided attention and love
If my heart had eyes it would cry
You`re still in my world
Life is worth livin` love
Tell me why

(Why, why me, baby) Why would you do it to me, baby, yeah, yeah
(Why, why me, baby) You hurt me so bad when you left me, baby

You broke my...heart, baby {Tell 'em what time it is, Keith}
(Why) {Tell 'em what time it is}

I walk around talkin` to myself
Do another day gets nothin`
Am I goin` crazy, baby
I look at the photograph that we once shared
And think about the moment, yeah, yeah
About each other
Remember the poems I used to say to you, girl

There`s a right and a wrong way to love somebody
I`ll always give all my love to you

Watch as I land in my man's crotch

Now there's a crew in perusin' what I'm doin'

You and who you knew but as I'm rollin'
Through your exes with my triple O
I'm yellin' tic tac toe from the waist below yo

You say tomatoes I say tomatoes
So pick up on my lead and lick on those toes
Me and my kitty cat is wearin' a hat
To the throne so baby take us to the end zone
I'm catching 80 in my shady to the top nickel
I'm the lady goin' crazy on your Popsicle
And as we come a little closer to the end of the game
You know I'm taking all the sweat out your name

You got to make your mind up
Yeah, Kut Klose, hear me out

You know you are my lover
You got me twisted over you
I know I got what you need
So what you want to do

Baby, baby I know
Baby I love you so
But you don't feel like I do
Tell me what can I do

But I gotta be strong
You did me wrong
When I thought that we were really down
So you say you want me
Make up your mind
'Cause I'm not gonna be here for long

Baby, baby in time
Baby I know you'll find
That what you needed was here
And think about it my dear
(rpt 2, 1...)

Breaking up down
You got me twisted
Thinking about the way that things use to be
When It was you and me girl I was so free
See you had my life
Like Cupid and I was just down right foolish and stupid
But now I know the reason for the pain and the headaches
You left me all alone now I can't even concentrate
I guess I'll wait for the day until you come back
Because my heart is where your love is at
You got me twisted

I'm the type you see at the bar  fresh  buyin' it up 
And every girl I talk to  yeah I'm tryin' to cut 
I tell'em all I'm Chi Chi and it's nice to meet ya 
Real quick  I tell how she got all the right features 
The jams come on and the glasses get refilled 
We dance and watch the relations build 
Now I'm all up in her ear and she listenin' 
At the same time, watchin' how a nigga glistenin' 
BLING! BLING! I'm thinkin' it's bout time to go 
Get the be	 out of valet and start the late night show 
Niggas hate, I know but I don't stop I shine 
I'm in the club every week, same place, same time 
Same thing on the mind, PARTY! PARTY! 
So the hell with all that, we tryin' to find somebody 
The right kind 'fore the lights come off 
Shit, I'm tryin' to take sumpin' home 

[Chorus] 
Now if I buy you a drink and you drink it up 
Then, uh, you goin' home with me (and all my niggas say) 
And if you talkin' at a party and we talk too much 
Then, uh, we goin' home with me 
Now if you came with a friend that don't want to do my man 
Then you need to give her your keys 
Tell her to call you tomorrow or give you a beep 
Cause tonight, you going home with me, ya heard? 

[JD] 
Now, is it because my name's Jermaine? no 
It's all about how I kick my game, you know? 
I just flow with it, spend a little dough with it 
Entertain, before you know, I'm in your brain doing my thang 
Tellin' you how good you smell 
Send you up for a drop top cruise through the A-T-L 
Now when they tipsy, it's risky, you don't know what you facin' 
Fuck around and end up like Anthony Mason 
So I let'em know a few things before we leave 
Like, ""it's true, I tapes damn near everything"" 
So don't even think about lyin', baby 
Or try baby, to set me up for rape cause it's all on tape 
Where you said put the cake 
How you fed me the grapes 
What I did with the ice that made you shake, shake 
Now when the night's over and the girl is gone 
I'm back up in the club singin' the same damn song 

[Chorus] 

Now, walk in, I'm the grown man that you figure to trick 
But I'm feelin' your dress, girl and lovin' your hips 
But I'm buggin' off this, ""Why you stuck on the wrist?"" 
Golddigger, huh, mommy? Oh, you ain't that bitch? 
Ain't that some shit? Suddenly, you hugs and kisses 
Gotta be the dough you holdin' so obvious wit' it 
I get G's to flash, T.V.'s in the dash 
See Sinbad, watchin' Vibe, ladies clockin' to ride 
Luxury flows, lengerie hoes, R.O.C. hit'em mo' than Jose Conseco 
Uh, RBI's, orange top fly, the brown skin, slim 
The nice braids, brown eyes 
R.O.C.'s stay pimpin' from Jersey to Richmond 
y'all playas waitin' to ball like 6th men 
I'm done with the game, point spread by a hundred 
Speakin' of hundreds, five's is a nice way to slide it, let's ride

Do you remember
The time we spent lovin' each other;
How much it meant?
You'd said we'd never,
Never intend to fall apart,
But you left me,
You really broke my heart.
I tried to play you,
But you played me first.
It was so foolish, oh, how it hurt.
I think about you, each and every day.
Oh baby, hear these words I say:

Can we make love for old time sake?
I remember, girl, the love we used to make.
You were mine before you were his.
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on.

As I sit and wipe my eyes,
I begin to question why.
Ask myself what went wrong;
Why we didn't last for long?
You blame me and I blame you,
There was nothin' left to do.
If we woulda thought it out
We prolly coulda worked it out.
Now you don't belong to me,
I think about you constantly.
What am I supposed to do?
I musta been a damn fool
To let your lovin' slip away.
I think about you everyday.
I must have been crazy... to let you get away.

A little patience, the time we pray

Gotta run for shade

We gotta cool this anger
What a mess we made
So long ago you were my love
Oh my love

Flyin' high we never took the time
To stop and feel the need
Funny how those years go by
Changing you, changing me
I remember love's fever
In our hearts, girl and in our minds

Oh ich weiß es nicht 

(Refrain) 
Dieser Brief 
Ist nur für dich 
Lies die Zeilen ... Ich vermisse dich 
Diesen Brief oh yeah 
Schreibe ich nur für dich und die Zeilen sind 
Ich liebe dich! 

Die Tinte ist genauso schwarz 
Wie dieses Loch in mir 
Die Sehnsucht ist nicht zu ertragen 
Wärst do doch nur hier 
Ich falle weiter tief hinunter 
Spürst, dass ich dich brauch´ 
Fang mich auf! 
Ich zähl´ die Stunden, die Sekunden 
Bei Tag und Nacht 
Wärst do nur bei mir 
Was hast do nur mit mir gemacht? 
Ich will dich mehr als ich beschreiben kann 
Vergehe nach dir ... Komm zu mir

And the cheatin' type, it wouldn't, couldn't, shouldn't be you
And when it comes to the lovin' that I gave (nobody)
Could ever to the wonderful things I did to your (body)
You confessed I was the best to caress your flesh
And pressed her with the S all you could say was yes
But I guess your ex made a harder impact,
Caught you cakin' at the mall its like you want him back, 
Nowadays all you do is lie to me, probably tired of me
My woman, you ain't gotta be
I tried to be your friend but I gotta go off intuition
Our relationship is a play, it needs an intermission

Make you spin around and 'round
Flip you girl from left to right

Baby can I just spend the night

You know what I'm talking about baby
I never meant to hurt you

Maybe I'm being major everything he does

I'm sitting here wishing it was us. 
Oh how can I take the game flip it upside down instead of him 
Baby girl I should be your man you should be sleeping in my bed. 
You're supposed to riding in the passenger seat of my car 
Let me make a move 
It's telestar sunshine baby I will steal you 
Tell your man he don't deserve you

Its painful to sit around watching the girl of my dreams
Its painful cause im alone and she the reason being

Down on the corner

That's when I first saw you girl, yeah, yeah, yeah
Looking so sweet, I said, how do you do, at the candy store
Down on the corner
You were my girlfriend, I was your boyfriend ?
I met you, at the candy store

[Chorus]

? in the back, sunroof top, TV in the seat with the gangster lean
Holler at the shawty, with the afro puff
Light blue halter top with bell bottoms with tops
Hat to the back, tube socks to the knee 
Me and my girlfriend, carved her name in the tree
We often fantasized about a life with me
Now all I have left is just a memory

Miss Mary Mac, Mac, Mac, all dressed in black, black, black
With silver buttons, buttons, buttons, all down her back, back, back
She asked her mother, mother, mother for fifteen cents, cents, cents
To see the elephants, elephants, elephants,
Jump over the fence, fence, fence

[Chorus: x2]

If you remember the candy store
Everybody clap your hands
If you remember the candy store and how it used to be
Just clap your hands
If you remember the candy store
And how it made you feel good
Close your eyes
If you remember the candy store
And wanna go back lemnme hear you say yeah",Candy Store,2011

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Has a searching soul inside

Never asking why, why would I
When I've felt the hand of eternity
It's a legacy I will leave, I want to leave

Heaven plants a special seed
And we must have faith for these

I will stand for the truth I've seen
So the truth is seen in me
I will give from the source of love
So all that I believe is handed down
For the road that's yet to be travelled on
By the ones who will carry on, I'll carry on

And give them the light of love to lead

Keith Thomas,"A king is crying from his throne
He had a queen but now she's gone
What is this magic that we seek
The mighty strong turn mighty weak
Every good girl hears it
Every bad boy fears it
No matter what i see
I believe, i believe

The power holds my hand

And through it all we still survive
A poor man screams but no one hears
Ain't nothing changed much through the years
Every bad day needs it
Every good day breeds it
No matter how it feels
When it's real you know it's real
Stronger than any bomb that any man has ever made

Just how amazed i am

Keith Urban,"Billy left on Friday night with twenty dollars cash
Had a thousand more and a diamond on his hand
When he got back
I don't know just where Billy got that dough

Saturday he spent in style
Drinks were on the house
Lincoln here, and a Jackson there
Suspicions were aroused

A dime was dropped and a name was named
A body soon was found
A travelin' Bible salesman on his monthly trip to town
Three bullet holes

A .38 done took his soul
What do you know
No diamond ring no money roll
A quick investigation

They dragged Billy to the station
And broke him down with the third degree
His alibi unraveled
Judge Riley banged his gavel

A 12-man jury all agreed
So he must be guilty
I knew Billy spent that night 
Winning big at cards

And the salesman was a married man
Who broke my sisters heart
Billy sits in Levenworth 
Waiting for the gas

And I know lots of other things
But no one ever asked
So they'll never know
Swear to God they'll never know

He had a pillow by the bed he used to pray on 
And a beat up old guitar he let me play on
I knew where my fingers went
From his greasy fingerprints
Yeah, he was passin' on
What was handed down to him

I never work on a Sunday
I've got a life of my own
And this here is the one day
I spend with my family at home

I left the office in a flash on Friday
Threw my boots in the car
Cashed my pay cheque & headed for the country
To sleep underneath the stars
I drove all day Saturday and right into the evenin' 'till there were no more city lights
Those broken lines were gettin' blurry through my windscreen
Well I guess I drove all night
Then Sunday mornin' found me rollin' into sunrise
With my fuel gauge dead
I pulled into fill up, found the place deserted and a little sign that read...

All I could do is call up a tow truck
To take me further down the road
I fumbled round & round for some change in my pocket, 
Walked fifteen minutes to the phone
There in the phone book I found a business ad-vert, saying ""Use Us Instead""
I dialed the number and a tape recorder answered and it politely said

I finally got back home and it took forever
Then at work the next day
Somebody said 
""Hey the boss said he wants to see you in his office right away""

And on the weekend could I stay

Sometime it's hard for me to understand
But your teaching me to be a better man

I want to love somebody, love somebody like you

I'm ready to love somebody, love somebody like you
I want to love somebody, love somebody like you

Hey I want to love ya baby, ah uh

I want to be the man in the middle of the night shining like it's true
I wanna to be the man that you run to whenever I call on you

I wanna be a better man I can see it in you yeah

Keith Urban,"Lately I've been noticing
I say the same things he used to say
And I even find myself acting the very same way
I tap my fingers on the table
To the rhythm in my soul
And I jingle the car keys 
When I'm ready to go
When I look in the mirror
He's right there in my eyes
Starin' back at me and I realize

[Chorus]
The older I get
The more I can see
How much he loved my mother and my brother and me
And he did the best that he could
And I only hope when I have my own family
That everyday I see
A little more of my father in me

There were times I thought he was bein'
Just a little bit hard on me
But now I understand he was makin' me 
Become the man he knew that I could be
In everything he ever did
He always did with love
And I'm proud today to say I'm his son
When somebody says I hope I get to meet your dad
I just smile and say you already have

[Chorus]

He's in my eyes
My heart, my soul
My hands, my pride
And when I feel alone

And I think I can't go on
I hear him sayin' ""Son you'll be alright""
Everything's gonna be alright""
Yes it is

The older I get
The more I can see
That he loved my mother and my brother and me
And he did the best that he could

I hope everyday I see

I never could stand that still
Ah but you changed so much in me

I got a hole in my jeans
I had a job and I lost it
But it won't get to me

'Cause I'm ridin' with my baby
And it's a brand new day
We're on the wheels of an angel
Flyin' away

And the sun is shinin'
This road keeps windin'
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
And I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't want to be me

Now she's strummin' on my six-string
Across her pretty knees
She's stompin' out a rhythm
And singin' to me the sweetest song

I rattled off names like I really didn't know
But all along I knew it was you

And, the longer we talked, the more we laughed
And wondered why we didn't last
It had been a long time, but later last night
Baby, we caught up real fast

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt

That's right
You look good in my shirt

Well now I'm not saying that we solved overnight
Every way that we went wrong
Oh, but what I'm seeing I'd sure love seeing
Every morning from now on

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt

c'mon now
Aww that's right
Oh you look so fine

Keith Urban,"There was a world outside my door
I wasn't in touch with anymore
There was a way I used to feel
I knew what was and wasn't real

You built a bridge, I tore it down
I felt safe on shaky ground
And I was a master of despair
Making believe I didn't care

[Chorus]
I shouldn't be standing here today
After all the crazy things I've done
I'm ready to fall and that's OK
I ran as far as I could run
You won

Out of a world turned upside down
It took some time to come around
Out of a dream you made me whole
Yes you did
You lit a fire down in my soul

[Chorus: x2]

And you won

I'm ready to fall
I thought I knew what I was doing
I thought I was in control
I thought nobody could slow me down
But what did I know
I was just a kid, a motherless child
No one to watch over me I was runnin' wild
Free of all responsibility 'til my life
And my love for myself caught up with me
Yeah, it caught up with me
And now I'm (ready to fall), yes I am
So ready",You Won,2002

[Chorus]
And call it an angel
Call it a muse
And call it karma that you've got comin' to you

It says, ""In God We Trust""
A little sure felt good
But a lot was not enough
And everybody loved me when I was on a roll
And I thought I had everything
When I held the gold

But you're not my god
And you're not my friend
You're not the one
That I will walk with in the end
You're not the truth
You're a temporary shot
You ruin people's lives
And you don't give a second thought
You're not my god

Little white lies on a mirror
Cut neatly in a roll
Medicine that kept me from lookin' in my soul
I thought you were the answer
To all of my despair
And you almost had me six feet down
But I'm still breathin' air

But you're not my god
And you're not my friend
You're not the one
That I will walk with in the end
You're not the truth
You're a temporary shot
You ruin people's lives
And you don't give a second thought
You're not my god

From the cradle to the grave
Temptations all around
But no matter how good the fix
It's gonna take you down
Now some call it a weakness
Some call it a sin
But it's all the same behind each game
I see your evil grin

But you're not my god
And you're not my friend
You're not the one
That I will walk with in the end
You're not the truth
You're a temporary shot

I can't believe I'm here again
So much for ever thinkin' that I could change
My good intentions still remain in chains

[Chorus]
She's gotta be over me now
Probably moved on with her life
Found someone she knows she can believe
God I would give anything if I could just go back again
And be the man she needed me to be

I thought I was a hero
I played him well
He saves the day but not himself
I acted out the lover
My finest part
Had all the lines but not the heart
No look where we are

[Chorus]

Be the man that she could trust, who put her first
Who tamed his demons, who healed her hurts
In health and sickness, who helped her grow
With no resentment, true repentance, God as my witness

She needed me to be, oh

Yeah, I could be that man she needed me, she needed me to be",She's Gotta Be,2004
Keith Urban,"My grandma was a wise old soul
Took me by the hand not long ago
Said, ""Son, what's your hurry, boy slow it down
Taste the wild honey, listen to the sound
Of the wind that's blowin' through the trees
Rivers flowin' to the sea
Yeah they're all headin' home just like you and me
Life's for livin' child, can't you see that?""

These are the days we will remember
And these are the times that won't come again
The highest of flames become an ember
And you gotta live 'em while you can

These are the days we will remember [Repeat: x4]

Take 'em by the hand and live your life
Take 'em by the hand don't let 'em all fly by

Keith Urban,"Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on, the sound turned down and a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and I on the walls around me
The way that it was and could have been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walkin' away

I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that bein' strong meant never losin' your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I want to cry

Would it help if I turned a sad song on
""All By Myself"" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
It's gonna hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you by hidin' this way

I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that bein' strong meant never losin' your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain

I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show

Keith Urban,"Car door slams, it's been a long day at work
I'm out on the freeway and I'm wondering if it's all worth
The price that I pay, sometimes it doesn't seem fair
I pull into the drive and you're standing there
And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all gonna be alright
You take my hand
You pull me close and you hold me tight

And it's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything
'Cause when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you 'cause baby
You're my better half

They say behind every man is a good woman
But I think that's a lie
'Cause when it comes to you I'd rather have you by my side
You don't know how much I count you to help me
When I've given everything I got and I just feel like giving in
And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile

In a cabin by a meadow where the wild bees swarm

And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us

I wanna honor your mother
I wanna learn from your pa
I wanna steal your attention like a bad outlaw
I wanna stand out in a crowd for you
A man among men
I wanna make your world better than it's ever been

And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us

We'll follow the rainbow
Wherever the four winds blow
And there'll be a new day
Comin' your way

I'm gonna be here for you from now on
This you know somehow
You've been stretched to the limits but it's alright now
And I'm gonna make you this promise
If there's life after this
I'm gonna be there to meet you with a warm, wet kiss
Yes I am

And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us
I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you baby

Keith Urban,"Outside my window, I swear on my mamas grave,
Faded out the street noise like an out of focus Polaroid,
So I shot the moon, and I cursed the wind,
Making me think that you were, here again,
Smoke and mirrors, somebody stole you away,
That's the biggest conspiracy since, JFK,
So we combed the corners, and glass houses,
Right directions, but, never found it.

Well I'd trade in all the rest of my days,
Just the mere reflection of your face,
For one shining moment

With you, or somebody like you,
With you, or somebody just like you,

Called inspectors, the cops and the CIA,
The drew chalk circles round, the place that we used to lay,
But nobody testified, not a single witness,
I swore I was crucified with, no forgiveness,
The sheriff shined his light like I was drunk and dangerous,
My hands were already tied, so he , put away his handcuffs,
And in my blindspot, I saw the silhouette,
Your crazy legs smoking a long black cigarette,
But I'd trade in all the rest of my days,
Your crooked smile, your wicked ways,
I'd fill up all this empty space,

With you, or somebody like you,
With you, or somebody just like you,
Oh you, or somebody like you, oh

Now I should of learned my lesson,
Done what I was told,
Should of counted all my blessings,
Like fingers and toes,
And now I'm, tripping like a blind man,
And searching high and low,
For you, or somebody like you
For you, or somebody just like you

For you, or somebody like you,
For you, or somebody just like you, oh oh

Where we can dream as big as the sky
I know it's hard to see it now
But baby someday we're gonna fly
This road we're on, you know it might be long
But my faith is strong
It's all that really matters

Keith Urban,"I woke up early this morning around four a.m.
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been tryin' my best to get along
But that's okay
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cap and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons

Gunners like me afraid of coming in last

So you better start livin' right now
'Cause days go by

Out on the roof just the other night
I watched the world flash by
Headlights, taillights running through a river of neon signs
But somewhere in the rush I felt
We're losing ourselves

Days go by
I can feel 'em flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind as the cars go by

So you better start livin' right now

And if you just can bare to be alone, then I'll stay

With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep

I've been trying my best to get along

Take your memories, I don't need 'em

In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been

I'm out on the freeway and I'm wondering if it's all worth
The price that I pay, sometimes it doesn't seem fair
I pull into the drive and you're standing there
And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all gonna be alright
You take my hand
You pull me close and you hold me tight

And it's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything

And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you 'cause baby
You're my better half

Something that you're looking for

And I won't do
So let the wind chase you

Just because it hasn't yet been found
And no one blames the moon for not shining
Just because it's hidden by a cloud

I don't wanna blame myself
Thinking that I'm not enough
And wonder what's wrong with me
Because I couldn't win your love

Keith Urban,"The water is wide, I can't cross o'er, 
And neither have I the wings to fly. 
Give me a boat, that will carry two, 
And both shall row, my love and I.

Oh love is handsome, and love is kind, 
Shining bright like a jewel, when first its new; 
But love grows old, and waxes cold, 
And fades away, like morning dew.

There is a ship, and she sails the sea, 
She's loaded deep, as deep can be, 
But not as deep as the love I'm in. 
I know not if I sink or swim.

The water is wide, I can't cross o'er, 
And neither have I the wings to fly. 
Give me a boat, that will carry two, 
And both shall row, my love and I.

Keith Urban,"I never was a straight-lace, straight A student
Teacher's pet or child prodigy
I wasn't gonna get rich throwin' a football
It take too long to get a law degree

So I sat down with momma and daddy
They tried to talk some sense into my thick head
But the best advice that I ever got
Was from my sister's rock star boyfriend

Just get you a guitar and learn how to play
Cut up some jeans, come up with a name
When you're living in a world that you don't understand
Find a few good buddies, start a band
Start a band, start a band

And all those girls that were too cool to talk to,
They'll be waiting in the line out back
Might get your picture in the hometown paper
Maybe buy your momma that Cadillac

Just get you a guitar and learn how to play
Cut up some jeans, come up with a name
When you're living in a world that you don't understand
Find a few good buddies, start a band

Start a band, scrape up some money, buy a van
Learn 'Free Bird' and 'Ramblin' Man'
Never buy another beer again

So get you a guitar and learn how to play
Grow out your hair, come up with a name
With a little bit of luck you'll be packing the stands

And you're feeling guilty
And you're wishing I was there
So you wanna say you're sorry

Well, please forgive me if I'm too gone to care
You can take back your goodbyes
Wipe off those sad eyes
?Cause I've got some tears of my own

Weather man says it?s gonna rain tonight
The kind of storm where the basement floods
And you lose the lights, should have thought of that before
?Cause I'm not your blue sky anymore

So you heard the pitter-patter of a lost heart beating
And learned what it was for
So you made a list of shoulders
That you'd be needing

Well mine aren't yours anymore
Come on, show me your temper
Be the man I remember
So I won't forget what you've done

Keith Urban,"Another long summer's come and gone
I don't know why it always ends this way
The boardwalk's quiet and the carnival rides
Are as empty as my broken heart tonight

But I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go, I understand
But you promised you'd be back again
And so I wander 'round this town
'Til summer comes around

I got a job working at the old park pier
And every summer now for five long years
I grease the gears, fix the lights, tighten bolts, straighten the tracks
And I count the days til you just might come back

And then I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go, I understand
But you swore you'd be back again
And so I'm frozen in this town
'Til summer comes around
And it comes around

And I close my eyes and you and I
Are stuck on the Ferris wheel rocking with the motions
And Hand in hand we cried and laughed
Knowing that love belonged to us girl, if only for a moment
And ""Baby I'll be back again"" you whispered in my ear
But now the winter wind is the only sound
And everything is closing down

My life used to be
And how without a single warning
It all slipped away from me

And like a fool I thought that I could fight
The shadows on my own
To the dark I was no stranger
But this was stronger than I'd known

And by the time I knew that I was in too deep 
I'd gone too far
And the light that used to guide me
Had faded from my heart

And I don't know how you found me
All I know is I owe you everything to you
Yes I do

I, I saw that you couldn't care less about what you do
You couldn't care less about the lies
You couldn't find the time to cry

We forgot about love
We forgot about faith
We forgot about trust
We forgot about us

Now our love's floating out the window
Our love's floating out the back door
Our love's floating up in the sky
In heaven, where it began
Back in God's hands

You said that you had said all that you had to say
You say, 'baby, it's the end of the day.'

We gave a lot
But it wasn't enough
We got so tired
That we just gave up

Now our love's floating out the window
Our love's floating out the back door
Our love's floating up in the sky
In heaven, where it began
Back in God's hands, back in God's hands

We didn't respect it
We went and neglected it
We didn't deserve it
But I never expected this

Our love floated out the window
Our love floated out the back door
Our love floated up in the sky
To heaven, it's part of a plan
It's back in God's hands, back in God's hands

No, we didn't understand, oh, just what we had (just what we had)

Keith Urban,"Last night I fell asleep, and I saw you dancing in my dreams,
Just like the autumn leaves have fall for you.
All for you.

You changed my life, you changed my ways.
I don't even recognize myself these days.
It must be a reflection of you.
Only you.

I can't remember feeling love like this in so long.
I can't imagine living life without you by my side.
Day after day you find a way to make this grown man cry.
It's so true, I'm all for you.

My arms still hold you tight, keep you warm in the coldest night.
My hand to pull your hair right back away from your eyes.
For you. Only you.

If I knew how to do it,
I'd paint the moon, the stars around you.
Paint the perfect kind of sunset.
But I couldn't make it more beautiful than you.
Oh, nothing compares to you.
You know it's true.

I can't remember feeling love like this in so long.
I can't imagine living life without you by my side.
Day after day you find a way to make this grown man cry.
It's so true, I'm all for you.
I'm all for you.

I can't remember feeling love like this in so long.
I can't imagine living life without you by my side.
Day after day you find a way to make this grown man cry.

Some might call it insanity.
Without a doubt for the rest of my life,
I'm going to be crazy.
Baby, crazy for you.

All for you.
I'm all for you.",All for You,2010
Keith Urban,"What kind of spell is this
That you've cast on me with your kiss
Its like I've lost all control of my senses
Its just not like me, to give in so easily
And drop my guard and leave my heart defenseless
Oh, but I'm feelin' good here beneath the pines of the Georgia woods

[Chorus]
And what a surprise, here by your side
Its more than a full moonshine and its driving me crazy
I waited so long, for something this strong
And now I gotta be fallin' 'cause I'm already callin' you baby

There's nobody here to see
These sparks between you and me
We'd better be careful my love, or these woods will be burning
Or maybe we just give in, throwing caution to the wind
Its funny how we ain't got any say in the matter

[Chorus]

Uh huh
Oh take me downtown
Uh huh

Yeah, I waited so long, somethin' is strong

Keith Urban,"I can't sleep, ain't no sleep a'coming
I'm just lying here thinking 'bout you
I'm in deep, falling deep into the picture
In my mind of everything we're gonna do

Over at the lake and down by the river
You can feel it start to rise
Wanna jump in my car, go wherever you are
'Cause I need you by my side

It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it's such a beautiful sound
But when you say my name in the middle of the day,
I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind,
Just waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go down

I wanna see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time
I try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile
One chance of meeting, you were walking by me on the street and I said hi
And that was the beginning of my heart spinnin' like these wheels in my head tonight

It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it's such a beautiful sound
But when you say my name in the middle of the day,
I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind,
Just waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go down

The only place that I wanna be is where you are
'Cause anymore than a heartbeat away is just too far

It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together
All I really want is more than this moment right now
'Cause when you say my name in the middle of the day,
I swear I see the stars come out
And when you hold my hand and I look into your eyes
Oh I swear it looks like you're waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go down

I swear it's like you're waiting on the sun to go down
Waiting on the sun to go down

Pull the car over
Now I'm sittin' alone on the roadside
I tilt the mirror down and say to me,
Why you always think the answers gotta be,
To just leave
I'm making the same mistake
I'm hoping its not too late
Because I

[Chorus]
I don't know where I'd be without you now
I guess I get scared 
And that's why I act like such a fool
Cause you're the one thing I can't lose
I feel the tears coming
And I wanna cry
I think of us baby
And all the love inside comes shining through
And it always leads me right on back to you

I never felt it,
I never knew
Someone who could get inside my soul the way you do,
Yes you do

Yeah you got me in the palm of your hand
Its beautiful and terrifying,
Can't you see
For someone like me
But instead of running in,
I know
Its when I should hold you closer
Because I

I don't know where I'd be without you now

Keith Urban,"Let's gettin' to the point, we're not even listening anymore!
We're just walking around in circles, and wearing holes out on the floor
I'm tired; I know you're tired and it's late,
And it's almost four.

And what are we trying to achieve, baby?
What are we trying to win?
I said the same thing three hours ago,
And now I'm saying it again.
And I know you and I well enough to know,
Neither one of us is giving in!

[Chorus]
Baby, I love you I'm not going to bed angry,
And baby, I need and I want you to be happy,
We've been going around in circles with no end in sight!
Maybe we should just
Shut off the lights,
And wait till the morning!
Shut off the lights,
Wait till the morning!

It's amazing all the old wounds
We still carry around,
Wait to bring 'em all up, when it all comes down.
Like it's coming down now!

Cause I don't wanna lose you,
And I don't wanna hate you,
I don't wanna feel that

Baby, I love you I'm not going to bed angry,
And baby, I need and I want you to be happy,

Keith Urban,"I've loved you since the very first day
When I caught you looking my way
A smile and just knew it.
And up until you came along, no one ever heard my song,
Now its climbing with a bullet.

Its nice to have someone, so honestly devoted,
But when it's said and done, girl I hope you know that,

The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to,
This life, this love that you and I have been dreaming of, for so long
It'd all be as good as gone, without you.

Oh ho, without you, hey hey

Along comes a baby girl, and suddenly my little world,
Just got a whole lot bigger, yes it did.
And people that I barely knew, who love me 'cause I'm part of you
Man it's tough to figure
How two souls can be, miles from one another
But still you and me, have somehow found each other.

The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to,
This life, this love that you and I have been dreaming of, for so long
It'd all be as good as gone, without you.

Without you, oh oh
Without you I'd survive, but I'd have to have the notion
That I could live this life, just going through the motions

The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to,
This life, this love that you and I have been building up so high
It's never gonna touch the sky, without you.

Mm, without you
Without you, baby, baby, baby without you

Just like that you gotta brand new life

Yeah where you wanna go, baby name the town
We can go up north or head down south

Come on turn it up, yeah
Start living your life
On the double, leave your troubles behind
You knew we're gonna be alright

You could be a black bird
On a country street
Hiding from the world with a broken wing
But you better believe, you gonna fly with me
You could be a songbird from the New Orleans
Scared of the rain just scared to sing
But you better believe, you're gonna fly with me

Well, here we are baby in the back of my van
Sun's going down sky's turning red
Stars coming out
Baby look at you now

God know how long but its been a while
Since I heard you laugh and I'd seen that smile
Felt that kiss and I can get use to this

You were so hot in your pink lipstick
Painted on the end of a lit cigarette
And I loved you girl, yeah, I loved you girl

And if I put it back on, I'm sixteen sittin next to you
Down by the river you got the shivers, so I put it around you
Were countin down the memories in the moonlight and red wine, vinyl static
Three polaroids, two young hearts, and one real cool, black, leather jacket

A little tattered and torn, it still keeps me warm on a Friday night
Bandana patch from kickin some ass in a frat boy fight
You wore it in the stands at the football games
Some ink beneath the sleeve, I still wear your name
And I loved you girl, yeah, I still love you girl

And if I put it back on, I'm sixteen sittin next to you
Down by the river you got the shivers, so I put it around you

You got two kids, hell, I got two kids, too
Thank God they look like you

And every night I put it back it on and Im sixteen sittin next to you
Down by the river if you get the shivers, Ill put it around you
Were makin them memories in the moonlight and red wine, vinyl static

There was no need to rush
That's when those cops
Came pulling up
And I thought
Man, ain't this some shhhh

Your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing

I know it sounds crazy

But there was somethin bout the way
The blue lights were shinin
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you
Going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that
Running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so
Innocent
But you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

Man, they weren't playin
They sure threw those cuffs on quick
You tried to sweet talk 'em
They didn't fall for it
But I did
You were on the left
I was on the right
I knew you didn't smoke
When you asked him for a light
And I laughed
He got mad and slammed the door

Side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didn't mind

We talked
And we laughed

We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all
When I think about those summer night
Sneaking out the window, running back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time 
All that wasted time
We were swinging out on the line

Tell your papa that I understood his looks
If I put it all together, you're a piece that wouldn't fit

Was in Miami

Even in the taxi I could hear my telephone ring
Calling me from

Now Amy just called and said ""Please come back""
I said ""I'm on my way, I ain't even unpacked""
""I want you, I love you"", that's all she had to say

It was perfectly clear,

Then head on south by any means
Thought I might blend in 'round New Orleans

I saw your face in a cloud
Saw your tears out on the wing

Birmingham would have to wait
For a little later date
And I said I’d see you later, New Orleans

Had seen their better days
And suddenly I had a change in dreams

Caught a plane from Birmingham
Back in your arms is where I am
At times we laugh and talk about
The day I did the Birmingham turnaround

It ain't nothin a little bit of love won't fix
It ain't nothin but a scratch, a little bit of love can't stitch.
It ain't nothin a little bit of love can't heal.
Your love makes me feel.
No matter what hands me -- it ain't nothin, it ain't nothin.
It was written all over her face she was about to climb the walls.
She said you gotta get me out of this place cause even

Well it's lonely out tonight down here in Georgia
And the oldest friend I've got I met today
The woman that I love just up and left me

Get me anybody on the phone
Look there in your book and pick a number
Cause you can't be choosy when you're this alone

The railroad had him haulin' cows through Texas at the time
The night I kicked a field goal at the big homecomin' game
Dad was kickin' hobos off another damned ol' train

Mama did her best to do it all when Dad was gone
And every night she'd swear he'd really rather be at home
Sometimes we'd believe her 'til we'd look in Daddy's eyes
He'd have that faraway look he never could disguise

Number two diesel fuel flowed through his veins

I wonder if she's singin' along

And realize how much I miss her call

Wishing that ol' phone would ring

And I'm good at finding shelter in a downpour

If I don't keep my head up, I may drown
But it's hard to keep believing, I'll even come out even
While the rain beats your hope in the ground

And when the player rolls on the big screen
So what about they running up to me
Like hey girl don't you remember me

I'm thinking yeah that's great, but who are you
They seem to ask the same questions every time
And I help em' out, help em' out, bring em' round'

You wanna try and get something from me but I know what's up

And a twenty inch flat HD

That's why I, I hate Madden

Messed around and took my boyfriend

You know how I'm takin’ this personal
Hands on my hip, muggin', neck rollin'
Snatched the controller, game over

Tried to act up, put his card like a school ID
Made him bounce, he don't really want me

So he couldn't have been that committed

He was all up in that tick, tick, boom

They think you're made here just a stuffler, you're up to no good
They think these brothers don't know nothing else but bling and white tees
And they think that all these women can do is somebody's weave

They think these hustlers and gangsters and goons riding by
But be easy with your mouth ?cause you don't know nothin? ?bout
The life that gets lived, the struggles to deal with
It?s hard some days, man, if you feel me then say I'm hood

Yes, I'm hood, H O O D
Don't speak on it if you don't know what it means
I was raised in the hood, overcame in the hood
Not ashamed of the hood ?cause the hood is in me

Yes, I'm hood, H O O D
Don't speak on it if you don't know what it means
I was raised in the hood, overcame in the hood
Not ashamed of the hood ?cause the hood is in me

Everybody put your hands up and rep the hood
If you wanna you can stand up, I know it feels good
Don't be ashamed of the hood, people change in the hood
Ain't nothin? strange ?bout the hood, it?s in everybody

No matter what you do they'll never see us no different
No matter what we accomplish [Incomprehensible]
We gettin? honors for Grammys, on Billboard chart toppers
Thought that they could stop us but we still got an Oscar

They can give it up because we ain't [Incomprehensible]
It?s a movement, baby, and there ain't no stoppin? that
So I?ma keep doin? me and hope you keep doin? you
We're look out for one another, at the end of the day I'm still hood

Don't be ashamed of the hood, people change in the hood
Ain't nothin? strange ?bout the hood, it?s in everybody

I don't matter if you got some hood in your blood
It don't make you any less, represent it like what?
It don't matter, it makes you more real than the rest
People think it?s disrespect, consider it a blessing

?Cause you grew up on another side
Saw the world with a different eye, people don't realize
Learn to appreciate the little things and the joy life brings
Ain't nothin? wrong with bein? hood

Yes, I'm hood, H O O D
Don't speak on it if you don't know what it means

[Verse 1:]
I know there is something that I'm feeling
But I can't quite put it into words
It's got me hopin hopin that you feelin it too
Cause for me it's a first
Does anyone truly understand what real love is about
Don't say I'm too young to know what's real
My heart skips a beat
I can hardly breathe
Every time that he comes near

It's so amazing almost crazy how
I'm thinkin bout you lately
Tell me how in the world did it come to this
It took me by surprise
When you opened my eyes
To hopefully show me what love is

[Chorus:]
How will I know
Could it be the butterflies I feel whenever I'm with you
How will I know
Or the way I'm at a loss of words I can hardly keep my cool
How will I know
Everyday now stop stop stop I keep thinkin bout you
How will I know I'm in love

How will I know
Could it be the butterflies I feel whenever I'm with you
How will I know
Or the way I'm at a loss of words I can hardly keep my cool
How will I know
Everyday now stop stop stop I keep thinkin bout you
How will I know I'm in love

Somebody tell me
Will I ever know
Somebody tell me
Will I ever know

[Verse 2:]
If it ain't love
Then tell me why am I always searching for excuses to call
And if it ain't love
Then tell me why am I always hopin' to see him in the halls
And if it ain't love
Somebody tell me why I lie awake at night starin' at the walls

And if this isn't love
Then I don't really need it cause I'm happy here with no love at all

It's so amazing almost crazy how
I'm thinkin bout you baby
Still I don't really know if this is real
I want you so much more
But I'm unsure if this is true love
That I feel

[Chorus:]
How will I know
Could it be the butterflies I feel whenever I'm with you
How will I know
Or the way I'm at a loss of words I can hardly keep my cool

Keke Palmer,"Listen up, turn your box up, gather all around
This one's strictly for the ghetto
Some of y'all recognize, some of y'all won't
Better pay attention and listen close

There was an old lady who lived in my hood
That sold freeze pops for a quarter
Had so many kids that I lost count
More sons than she had daughters

And every night before they would fall asleep
They'd pray for shelter and food to eat
But the landlord huffed and blew the house down
Now they out on the streets

And now she cleans, she mops
The tears they drop
The only sound that drowns it out
Comes from my music box

So just let the music play
Don't let it stop
It ain't easy growing up in the hood
But I got my music box

When the sirens sound wind it up
Or the shots ring down just wind it up
[Incomprehensible] the hood but I'm up to no good
?Cause I got my music box

There was an old man, he lived in the hood
Had rubber bands, dimes, and quarters worth a block
Put him away, left his wife and kids
And a sexist teenage daughter

Couldn't shake the reflections, starved to perfection
I've seen it all before
Now she ignores the advice of a kid folk
Tell her stay home but she creeping out the back door

And now she pays the cost
Young girl so lost
I feel your pain, try to maintain
Wind up your music box

So just let the music play
Don't let it stop
It ain't easy growing up in the hood
But I got my music box

When the sirens sound wind it up
Or the shots ring down just wind it up
[Incomprehensible] the hood but I'm up to no good
?Cause I got my music box

This hood situation's got me sick
Call the doctor, quick, quick, quick
Doctor, doctor, will I die?
Na, na, young girl, just let the song play

So just let the music play
Don't let it stop
It ain't easy growing up in the hood
But I got my music box

When the sirens sound wind it up
Or the shots ring down just wind it up

But you're giving me this feeling that we're drifting apart
You don't come to me like you use to and I don't cry on your shoulder
I'm trying to understand this before darkness takes over

Did we lose touch cause' I didn't show you love?
Did I say too much, didn't I say enough?
Did I let you down last time you came around?
I hate to see you pull away

It's like our rainbow's fading to black and white
And I just don't know why we have to fight
Do we have a problem? Can we resolve it?
Is it something that we gotta talk about? Can we figure it out?

'Cause if we can't make it work, make it right
Our rainbow's gonna turn to black and white
White, white, white, white

The distance between us is growing everyday
Filling up with words, we had no chance to say
What we had was like magic, we?d always thought the same thing
I'm afraid we might lose that, the colors are already changing

Did we lose touch cause' I didn't show you love?
Did I say too much, didn't I say enough?

Our rainbow turns to black and white
Can we resolve it? We gotta get over it

The shades have turned to black and white
Every color disappears when you're not here

Can we resolve it? We gotta get over it

I just wish we could go back to the way we were before as friends
I mean right now it just seems like something?s wrong
No more fights, no more violence
Wanna be best friends

Just doesn't make sense, I mean I know how it can be

Keke Palmer,"I'm gonna make a change,
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good,
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right...

As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street,
With not enough to eat
Who am I, to be blind?
Pretending not to see their need
A summer's disregard,
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on
The wind you know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)

I've been a victim of
A selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home,
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me,
Pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred,
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
(A washed-out dream)
They follow the pattern of
The wind, you see
Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Ooh!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that...
Change!

I'm starting with the man in the mirror,
(Oh yeah!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
(If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause if you close your heart
Then you close your...)
Mind!

Starting with the man in the mirror
(Oh yeah!)
I'm asking him to change
(Better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah
(Oh yeah!)
Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life",Man In the Mirror,2012

Until I had them memorized.
But when I get up the nerve to tell you,
The words that never seem to come out right oh

If only you knew how much I do,
Do love you, oh.
If only you knew,
How much I do, do need you.

I dream of moments we share, but your not there,
I'm living in a fantasy.
But you don't even suspect,
Could probably care less,
About the changes I been going through.

If only you knew how much I do,
Do love you, oh.

How much I do, do need you.

And baby I been thinking

Said I remember how you used to love

How you used to love, you don't love no more
How you used to care, you don't care no more
That's alright, that's OK

Now boy I can remember how I used to foot the bill
And yes I do regret the day I took your broke ass in
To my life, to my home, to my bed
Said that I must have lost my head

I guess you thought 
That I'd let you walk on me like the floor
I guess you thought 
That you'd keep tracking dirt inside my door
You got it all wrong
It's been too long 
All of the love is gone
Now I'm singing you this song

How you used to love, you don't love no more
How you used to care, you don't care no more

I don't want to hear it
Get your shirt, shoes, pants 
And draws up from outta here

Sit back, close your eyes
Peep back, got you open wide
I'll let you get a taste of me
It's going down in mystery
Sit back, close your eyes
Peep back, got you open wide
I'll let you get a taste of me
It's going down in mystery

Well it's the microphone ripper, party-rockin' gift of gab
I hit the scene, lift you on my beam
And send you through my high plains
Mind-train shiftin' through your migraines
Spit with that I hit with patterns get you twisted sideways

And I'm the head honcho, sport golden tonsils
Inventing new styles all the time like pronto
Four by four, runnin' over suckers like a Bronco
Haters say the lyrics ain't Gonzo but they wrong though

We walking up and locking up the game and sparking up the flame
You're not gone' be the same when our flow reach your brain
It's about to bust

Not your crush, show up at our show in a tacky dress
Sparking us, talking 'bout your prowess but we're not impressed

Checkmate, populous crush, monstrous plush
Rhymes that just thrust onto your buck buck
Just rush

Just rushing like the Nile River, power we deliver
See it's (going down in mystery)

You know, I know, you know, I know
(It's going down in mystery)

(Gift of Gab won't you learn 'em and assure 'em)
(That the fire that you spit will burn them)
Burning up the track and turning up the action
(Murder one attack him)
Serving what you're rapping
Urban gutter anthems
(Certain of the fact)
Curtains for the wack
Searching for the knack
(You're pervin' off the fatness)
Fury of the rather early mornings after
(Worldly like disasters)
Purely just the baddest, the chief clamp down on 'em
(Like a vice on a melon squeezing tight on your temples)
Feel the bass (as the wind blows)
In your face (and your mental) hear the taste
Instrumentals even break down on you like this
(We surpass your previous standards) drastically
(Mastering bass), setting nights so bright
(Beneath the skylight)
And days (and weeks) and months (go by)
And years (and decades) and we still so fly
(While the others are just fly by night)
And not tight (we keep writing)
Like scribes (but we tight) and so wise (c'mon)

The rhyme historian exploring everything that we got
And even more so we exploring everything that they not
These are the glory days for lyricists, forever we plot
Wait wait wait wait hold on a second bring it back (we plot x 4,
C'mon)

And even more so we exploring everything that they not
