I guess that this is where we've come to 
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me 
But I, won't be there when you go down 
Just so you know now 
You're on your own now, believe me

Ryu:
Yo, I don't wanna be the one to blame
You like fun and games, keep playin' 'em
I'm just sayin'
Think back then we was like one and the same
On the right track, but I was on the wrong train
It's like that, now you gotta face the pain
And the devil's got a fresh new place to play
In your brain like a maze you can never escape
The rain, every damn day's the same shade of grey

Mike:
Hey, I used to have a little bit of a plan
Used to, have a concept of where I stand
But that concept slipped right outta my hand
Now, I don't really even know who I am
Yo, what do I have to say? Maybe
I should do what I have to do to break free, and
Whatever happens to you, we'll see
But its not gonna happen with me

I guess that this is where we've come to 
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me 
But I, won't be there when you go down 
Just so you know now 
You're on your own now, believe me

Mike:
Back then, I thought you were just like me
Somebody who could see all the pain I see
But you proved to me unintentionally
That you would self destruct eventually
Now I'm thinkin' like the mistake that I made doesn't hurt
But it's not gonna work cause its 
Really much worse than I thought
I wished you were something you were not 
And now this guilt is really all that I've got

Tak:
You turned your back and walk away ashamed
All you got
Is a memory and pain, nothing makes sense
You stare at the ground, and hear my voice inside your head 
When no one else is around
What do I have to say
Maybe I should do what I have to do to break free, yeah
Whatever happens to you, we'll see
But it's not gonna happen to me

I guess that this is where we've come to

Come walkin' out

Yes, I'm goin', babe I'm goin'
And your crying won't make me stay
Oh, the more that you cry, baby
More I'll go away
More I'll go away
More I'll go away

Well now I know
I know you don't want me

Bobo General,"Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her, whenever it starts
And it's magic, if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout rock and roll

If you believe in magic don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen it'll start with a smile
It won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind

If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning 'til there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me

Yeah, do you believe in magic
Yeah, believe in the magic of a young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Ohh, talking 'bout magic

Do you believe like I believe (Do you believe in magic)
Do you believe like I believe (Do you believe, believer)
Do you believe like I believe (Do you believe in magic)",Do You Believe,
Bobo General,"The room has suddenly grown cold
And outside in the street it's raining
You packed your bags and said good-bye
You took my heart without explaining
How could you go
How could you go
We had a love most people never know
Stop
Before you break my heart

[Chorus:]
I want you back
Don't care what I have to do
I want you back
I want you back
Gotta get it through to you
I want you back
If I can make you see only you can fill the need in me
If you walk away you'll regret it someday
Please
Stay!

This room is full of memories
And shadows of the past remind me
Of all the love I gave in vain
And all the hurt I feel inside me
I want you back
I want you back
We had a love most people never know
Stop
Before you break my heart

[Chorus:]

I want you back
I
I want you back

I want you back
I
I want you
I want you back!

Stop

Bobo General,"Music is my life, music is the key 
Cause the rhythm's gonna get me, music takes me higher 
Music is my life, music is the key 
You're my first, you're my last, you are burning like a fire 
Nananananananana, nananananana 
Nananananananana, let's sing together 

Say go, say when, say now, say hit-it, 
Ready to rumble dance here we go 
So, going up and down round and round on and on 
Yo - how to throw a pair of dice 
Be hot, be cool, be cold as ice 
This is the time you better don't think twice 
Be nice, emergency 
Go mad, go wild, go nasty, go free 
Like a maniac, you're feeling wild with me 
Ringdingdong ringadinga ding dong 
In a seventies style, it's a bobo song 
Time for the old school, play that track 
Mister deejay - bring the beat back, bring it back 
Place is packed, so many different people 
All ages and races, sweet faces 
Come from different places 
Get on the floor you better dance tonight, music is my life 

Five, four, three, two, one here we go, 
Get dressed get going it's time for the show 
Now tonight is the night we're dancing you know 
How - how to dive in the sea of sounds 
Right place, right time, right moment, right spot 
Everybody in the place feel hot and dance 
Wiggle around you better take this chance 
Feel free, feel wild, feel crazy, feel young 
Like kids are playing, have some fun 
Everyday like a playball, everybody party all 
Day no work, I'll play, okay, hooray, summer holiday 
Dance to the beat of the street 
Where the heat is on, till the break of dawn 
We gonna moove on strong - sing this song 
Everybody in the place enjoy the party, music is my life 

It's a new generation 
Without hate and frustration 
Promised land, promised nation 
Without pain, without control 

",Music Is My Life,1999
Bobo General,"[Chorus 1]
We are what we are - Together
And we went so far - Together
We are what we are - Together
We all long for a land to be free

The promised land is close to you
The rain is gone, the sky is blue
Hand in hand we can survive
We're fighting for a better life

It's a new generation
Without hate and frustration
Promised land, promised nation
Without pain, without control

[Chorus 2]
Together forever for all the time
Together we welcome the secret sign
Together in freedom we take the chance
Together forever we will be friends

[Chorus 1]

Planet earth is our place
Insanity is lost in space
A world of dreams is what we share
Where honesty is in the air

It's a new generation
Without hate and frustration
Promised land, promised nation
Without pain, without control

Together we welcome the secret sign
Together in freedom we take the chance
Together forever we will be friends

Bobo Hope,"We're off on the road to Morocco
This camel is tough on the spine (hit me with a band-aid, Dad)
Where they're going, why we're going, how can we be sure
I'll lay you eight to five that we'll meet Dorothy Lamour 
(Yeah, get in line)

Off on the road to Morocco
Hang on till the end of the line (I like your jockey. Quiet)
I hear this country's where they do the dance of the seven veils
We'd tell you more (uh-ah) but we would have the censor on our tails 
(Good boy)

We certainly do get around
Like Webster's Dictionary we're Morocco bound

We're off on the road to Morocco
Well look out, well clear the way, 'cause here we come
Stand by for a concussion
The men eat fire, sleep on nails and saw their wives in half
It seems to me there should be easier ways to get a laugh
(Shall I slip on my big shoes?)

Off on the road to Morocco
Hooray! Well blow a horn, everybody duck
Yeah. It's a green light, come on boys

We may run into villains but we're not afraid to roam
Because we read the story and we end up safe at home (yeah)
Certainly do get around
Like Webster's Dictionary we're Morocco bound

We certainly do get around
Like a complete set of Shakespeare that you get

Bobo in White Wooden Houses,"You and me feeling good and obviously
Together we were so strong
I felt so nice when I walked down to the city
On the way to you away from here
Now it's spring again
I come home with a bunch of flowers
Only to stimulate my mind
Sometimes I need such a thing for confidence
I'm looking for improvements of sense
You know it's a worn out old phrase
That you don't love me anymore
I appear four times a day with a new make up
Just to hide my tears
I want to be so strong but what do you want?
I want to be so strong
But hey what do you want?
I look for compensation my vision falls to pieces
I look for satisfaction when I can't sleep at night
But I don't need a substitute

It might be better I go my own way please tell me

But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone

How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far

Qui davanti a un fiume ce ne stiamo qui
Sotto al cielo che ci cade giù, giù, giù

Que lame el mar
Su pequeña huella
No vuelve más
Un sendero solo
De pena y silencio llegó
Hasta el agua profunda

De penas mudas llegó
Hasta la espuma

Sabe Dios qué angustia
Te acompañó
Qué dolores viejos
Calló tu voz
Para recostarte
Arrullada en el canto
De las caracolas marinas
La canción que canta
En el fondo oscuro del mar
La caracola

Te vas Alfonsina
Con tu soledad
Qué poemas nuevos
Fuíste a buscar?
Una voz antigüa
De viento y de sal
Te requiebra el alma
Y la está llevando
Y te vas hacia allá
Como en sueños
Dormida, Alfonsina
Vestida de mar

Cinco sirenitas
Te llevarán
Por caminos de algas
Y de coral
Y fosforescentes
Caballos marinos harán
Una ronda a tu lado
Y los habitantes
Del agua van a jugar
Pronto a tu lado

Bájame la lámpara
Un poco más
Déjame que duerma
Nodriza, en paz
Y si llama él
No le digas que estoy
Dile que Alfonsina no vuelve
Y si llama él
No le digas nunca que estoy
Di que me he ido

Bobo Stenson,"I remember holdin' on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

I only miss you here every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowin up from the Carribean
Most Novembers I break down and cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye",Goodbye,2005

Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,

One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Boby Lapointe,"Ceci est une guitare...
Je ne joue pas de la guitare classique. Je ne joue
pas du Flamenco.
Je joue de la guitare sommaire.
Je suis professeur de guitare sommaire.
Je ne suis pas ici pour vous distraire, mais pour
instruire.
Maintenant, s'il y en a que ça amuse de rire, je
peux aussi distraire...
Je peux instruire en 'distraisant."".. treize ans et
demi maximum...
Après je prends ma retraite.

Petit cours de guitare sommaire :
Une guitare...est un instrument... en forme de
guitare...qui comporte six cordes. Si l'on partage la
guitare en deux par le milieu (ce qui n'est pas à
conseiller...)
On obtient deux moitiés de guitare... et ...3 cordes
d'un côté... 3 cordes de l'autre.
Ces 3 cordes du haut s'appellent par conséquent
les basses.. en guitare ""classique"" !
En guitare ""sommaire"" on ne les appelle pas : on
les ignore !
La grosse difficulté de la guitare sommaire est
d'éviter de toucher à ces cordes du haut qu'on
appelle ""les basses.""
Pour ce : ne tripotons pas la guitare avec tous les
doigts...
Servons nous uniquement du pouce...
Comme son nom l'indique ""Pouce"" ça ne compte
pas.
Pouce, c'est pour rire : Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah !... Assez
ri : 1re leçon :
Les deux accords : en guitare sommaire, nous
avons deux accords. C'est beaucoup...
Ce n'est pas trop.
Pour effectuer ces deux accords, nous avons une
main gauche avec un pouce (qui ne compte pas...
ah ! ah !) et un index.
Avec l'index, nous viendrons appuyer sur les
cordes à proximité (c'est-à-dire pas trop loin).
Soit sur cette corde-ci (que nous appellerons la
corde ""si""), soit sur cette corde-là que nous
appellerons donc la corde ""mi"") et, nous
obtiendrons les deux accords suivants : bling et
blang !...
C""est très facile : bling... (c'est facile mais il ne faut
pas toucher la corde à côté...)
Bling !... et blang !... (comme j'ai montré tout à
l'heure).

Debaixo de 7 chaves
Dentro do coração
Assim falava a canção
Que na América ouvi
Mas quem cantava chorou
Ao ver seu amigo partir

Mas quem ficou, no pensamento voou
Com seu canto que o outro lembrou
E quem voou, no pensamento ficou
Com a lembrança que o outro cantou

Amigo é coisa pra se guardar
No lado esquerdo do peito
Mesmo que o tempo e a distância digam não
Mesmo esquecendo a canção
O que importa é ouvir
A voz que vem do coração

A little more every day

I'll stand naked
(And I'll find my way through the darkness)
If you'll stand naked with me

BoDeans,"When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn


And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am",Paradise,1991

And everybody needs a chance once in a while
Everybody wants to be, closer to free

Everybody needs to touch, you know, now and then
And everybody wants a good, good friend

This heart hit the sidewalk wonderin'
Why you left it on

Was stuck out in a blizzard in it's summer clothes

When the love comes
And when it goes

This heart's gonna let it go
'Cause this heart knows the bells she's hearin'

They came a long time before me
Now, we've come on the steamship Atlantic
From our home far across the stormy sea

I have their letter in my pocket
They said, we would meet on the pier
But the day it is now, almost over
And the darkness and cold, soon draw near

Will they know, their lost little children?
As they look for my face in the crowd
It's been so long since they've seen me
And I wonder if they'll know me now

We gave them, our four pounds and twenty
One last look, at that green rocky shore
And they told us, the new world has plenty
But we'd never see Sligo, anymore

And I wonder if they'll know me now

For we have a good father and mother
And soon we'll be safe by their side

Bodega Bamz,"Cry first and laugh last
Television was on, we never had Dash
And the city was flooded with mad crack
'Cause they experiment on minorities like we lab rats
Priorities, it's fuck authority
A man that can stand on his own and show maturity
I ain't ever ask for a loan, I've been supportin' me
Takin' cash from hoes like a sorority
Oh yeah they comin' for your life
I'm comin' for your life
It's bonded, I'm livin' out of spite
You ain't bleed then it wasn't worth the fight
I'm givin' y'all bread and water, ah bread and water all they get
And it ain't shakin' no hands, so fuck your politics
This isn't makin' a ?, I burn a lot of bridges down
Then I played in the ash like fuck your following
All we ever wanted was good pussy and credit scores
Their own cars is better than all our rentals are
I'm sick of y'all, dudes switchin' and gettin' hot
Like Bruce Jenner and menopause
Ain't never told us detox the senators
I say they sent us to detox the criminals
So the minute that we pop his genitals
Emilio ain't gon' ever fall, I told y'all

Everybody pressin' charges, they ain't change where I'm from
It's no game, even Ndamukong Suh
Connect try to keep me out the loop
It's canine proof, all my birds in the coop
Niggas wanna see me in the cage, but why?
My lawyer gets surprised with the money I save
I'm low like Fetty Wap's left eye
I coulda sworn I saw Left Eye at Best Buy
Nike slippers, read the paper on the milk crates
Sippin' Arizona, I got stripes like a Zebra Cake
Believe me, fast money like a relay
Shopped in SoHo when Prince Street had replays
?, I love my heritage
And fuck the race, if you real you my relative
Why so sensitive?
The revolution will be tele-vized
Excuse the grammar, I'm a ghetto kid
My grandma still alive and all 11 kids
Only my father made it, let's reminisce another time
Bought a watch with these bars to kill time
Sick in the head, now that's an ill mind
Shine like a d-d-diamond ? young
I said one day I'd have a Lambo, not a Hyundai
I kill for these stacks like Jimmy Caan
Wait let a G win like the Padres
Let a G win like Tony's last name
Who played first base for San Diego
Had to break it down
Fuck the cops, we gotta triumph
Fight for Freddie right now, it's about to be more riots
They wanna kill the youth when they need more guidance
With more violence you can only expect more defiance
It's hard to be vocal when they shoot you up and choke you
Die unexpected if the wrong one approach you
Sharpton ain't doin' enough, where's all the leaders?
Breakin' the same laws, we follow how they teach us
I never seen a thug win a million with Regis
Or a single mother from the ghetto either
Fuck y'all

It's a small island in the Caribbean that we be in
Goes by the name of Puerto Rico

Nigga the champ is here, Cassius Clay in his prime
The Mike Tyson, Bruce Lee, Stephen Hawking of rhymes
Combined with Einstein's mind and then refined like it's wine
I write divine rhymes, I fill my time by feelin' these dimes
Fill my satisfaction with valid rappin' and Magnum wrappin'
Fact I haven't felt emotions that's potent since daddy's passin'
I'm the Marilyn Manson of ? relax in baths of acid
I got True Religion jeans, if I kill you it's act of passion
I'm a dragon from ?
Aptitude is ample to pass all the rap masters
Who master it, cracking ribs
Put you in the earth, what it's worth you can act natural
The pragmatical mathematical rappin' cannibal
Who fight with animals, Bronx nigga that has an attitude
You see my avenue is compatible with a battle room
I never sold crack, just wrote dope lines to hand to you
Package that, I got the Cadillac of flows
Cataracts these hoes cause I'm soundin' like platinum gold
You never see a ghost, that's what me and my dad was told
So now I'm pickin' up the torch while these labels haggle my soul
Y'all can suck the undercuts of my nuts while I take a shit
Only spend nights, I don't gotta know what patience is
All you niggas bitches, to exist you gotta take my rent
Blow your fuckin' head off clean bro, save the witness

Latino, I'm that and I'm proud
If you don't know us, let me tell you about
Niggas that slam their dominoes loud, let you see copy
Beef copy ox cutter make his cheep choppy
Cherry coco, peña drip 'til your teeth sloppy
Hustlers become connects when they need papis
Lease a Honda, Chevy on the back block
Runnin' routes with the bow bow in the stash box
When I speak it's chop yaow, I'm a New Yorican
Calderon on the phone, I'm in ? creepin'
Y'all hangin' on resorts to just chill
I'm in the caserios take a walk down the hill
One way in, one way out, where y'all all could get killed
Leave them niggas alone, that's how the officers feel
Nigga, my people, beach, 98 gettin' our tan on
Slippers walkin' on ?, hittin' the sand strong
But plan wrong, it will transform
Wet you then find a Jet Blue out to San Juan
We don't look for parties, the party's wherever we go
Turn the corner section to the 4th of Julio
Too much to fit in one 16
So let me cook like the festival on 1/16
Mean, my career's been like one sick dream
A nightmare, scary how I does this thing
You ain't elite, I'm made of deep
God thought he was stuntin' when he created me
Rap's Bobby Fischer, nigga please take a seat
I made you in three moves: ink, paper, beat
Y'all keep playin', nigga, we play for keeps
Stop claimin' to be what my eyes don't see though
Every verse I spit, you get an 'ay dios mio'

Dismember contenders with every word I speak
With any word that's wrote, the King James I preach
The insane I see, clear view my peak
Mountain top, no sweat like Keith Cool collect
You gotta prove me wrong
You can't prove these set traps
Like boobie setbacks
My uzi det dat
Loosie puff up, coughing lungs up
I'm from NY, we pop Chris like Tucker
This brick got locked up
Duct tape tucked up
This traffic fucked up
But nothing get me nervous when I'm trafficking weight, wait
The time and the place
You bring me static, your death come
I select the date
I hate the hate, I hate the love
I hate the fake
I don't need to flex like Gray, what his name?

Bodega! Bodega!

If you fucking on the plane for the first time, Fly Virgin
I put ice on the finger roll, what am I, a Spur like Gervin?
I made a living off rap, on purpose
Should I chase the money like JPMorgan?
Pay me portions, nah ah, I need that fortune
Like no sorcerer, I need sources
Check for the wire taps on cordless
Gorgeous thug, I don't need a course to put a hole in one
If they tryna cap a 10, they could hold the sun
Black boy with the golden tongue
Spit carrots, blow purp like puns
Heartburn, no tums
If you bite the hand that feed you, I'm a cut off thumbs
No lie, come try

Hey lover am I the only one 
Or are you selling your baby a dream

Hey lover boy am I the only one 
Or are you selling your baby a dream 
(Am I a sucker for love a sucker for love) 

Damn I'm trippin' 'cause I never really felt like this 
To me women used to be only fuck foxes 
But it's like with you I cherish every kiss 
I know it's a risk but you make me want to come clean 
I want to make you my queen 
Put you in a crib and give you plenty green 
To help you fulfill all your childhood dreams 
Only for your love I fiend 
'Cause the way you put it on me make me want to scream 
And fuck you in places you ain't never seen 
In a private boat as we float down stream 
Yeah I already know you done heard this before 
But the way you make me feel is real 
Playas don't love no hoes but stayin' true like you do 
Got me head over heals, so tell me what's the deal, baby 
'Cause you lookin' too fine to not be mine 
And I ain't gon' never be satisfied 
Unless you're on my side to the end of time 
I can tell you think I'm lying 
But I swear to you girl this ain't no scheme 
You stay on my mind, even in my sleep 
You keep a nigga havin' wet dreams, on the real

Wearin' black and white and some brand new Mike's 
Draped in ice, attitude nice 
You the type of woman that I need in my life 
To add a little spice, cookin' nigga steak and rice 
I can see you'd one day man and wife 
Walkin' down the aisle, havin' our first child 
Plus our marriage worth while 
With a brand new lifestyle, I could walk that mile 
But baby I need you right now 
In my arms caressin' me 
I can see your eyes undressing me 
Girl it's destiny and love is the recipe 
But this way's got the best of me 
On everything, I can guarantee you better things 
If you just get rid of ""what's his name"" 
And let me in your world 
So I can show you, baby, that my love is real and not a game 
So can a brother come through 
So I can show you, boo, just exactly what I mean 
It don't matter if you fuck me tonight or next month 
Babe, only time can reveal a dream

Baby I'll drink your bath water about a pint 
Think I'm ever gon' give your love away, uh-uh 
I ain't sayin' you never lovin' another nice stud but shit 
I'm cravin' you every night and we just met on a night 
But it seems like I've been knowin' you all my life 
Ain't it funny how you be thinkin' you never be true enough, but you the one 
A helpless seeks succumb, lovin' you more than everything 
But my dollars, ? and smokin' sticky up through the lungs 
I can see you havin' my sons, screamin' your name on my next tape deck 
In the city, no hear my pretty go

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

About now, I want to tell you a little love story, you know
What I'm sayin', this is a Body Count love story check out
The lyrics, you know, I'm a tell you 'bout what happened
When we went down South last year on tour.

Out on tour yo, I been all around the world
Went to Georgia, met this fine-assed white girl,
Blonde hair, blue eyes, big tits and thighs,
The kinda girl that would knock out most guys.
She got wild in the backstage bathroom,
Sucked my dick like a muthafuckin' vacuum,
Said ""I love you, but my daddy don't play,
He's the fuckin' grand wizard of the KKK.""

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha fuck her dear old dad.

You know what I'm sayin'. So we was down South fallin' in
Love, you know, D-Roc had this Nazi girl, my man
Mooseman had a skinhead, I fell in love with Tipper Gore's
Two twelve year old nieces. It was wild, you know what I'm
Sayin', it got even worse, you know.

So one night they took us to a meetin'
White sheets, white hoods, no room for seatin'
There was Skinheads, Nazi's and crazies,
Talkin' 'bout black people pushin' up daisies.
They hated Blacks, Jews, Puerto Ricans,
Mexicans, Chinese, even the Indians.
We had our hoods on,
We were slick
She pushed her butt up hard against my dick.
Then her daddy jumped on the stage
Talkin' 'bout killin' in a goddamn rage.
I got mad, my dick got hard
Entered in her ass
She said, ""Oh my God!""

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha fuck her dear old dad.

So what we really tryin' to say is Body Count loves
Everybody. We love Mexican girls, Black girls, Oriental girls,
It really don't matter. If you from Mars, and you got a pussy,
We will fuck you. You know, that's all we're sayin', word.

So every year when Body Count comes around
We throw an orgy in every little Southern town.
KKK's, Skinheads, and Nazi
Girls break their necks
To get to the party.
It ain't like their men can't nut,
Their dick's too little

All my life I loved this girl so much,
All my life I loved her simple touch.
She cared for me and put me on this earth,
Oh the pain of just a simple birth.
But now I find that she has left me dumb and blind,
Poisoned, twisted, and destroyed my mind.
She taught me things that simply were not true
She taught me hate for race
That's why I hate you!
There's only one way I can make it right,

Momma, momma, I always loved my momma,
I always loved my momma.
I loved the way she hold me,
I love the way she talked to me.
She used to teach me a lot of things,
She taught me good things, she taught me bad things.
""Don't trust white people, don't trust white people.
Don't trust white people, they're no good, they're no good,
They're no good, they're no good.
They're just gonna rip you off, they're just gonna rip you off.
Don't trust 'em, don't trust 'em.""
I said, ""Why momma?"", she said, ""I told you don't
Trust 'em they're no good.""
I said, ""Momma, I thought we were all the same momma,
Why momma?"" She said, ""Don't ask me any questions.
Don't you challenge your mutha."" Momma.

So one day I found I fell in love
And I brought my girlfriend home
And I introduced her to my mutha and
She smacked me, was a white girl and
I said, ""Why momma? Why momma? What did I do wrong?""
You know, I found out my mutha was a evil woman.
She hated Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Jamaicans,
Indians, Orientals, momma was no good.
I learned to hate my mutha, hate my mutha.
So I got some, ha ha, some lighter fluid, from the corner store
And I put it around her bed, and I set her on fire!
Ha, ha, ha.
Burn momma, burn momma, burn momma, burn bitch
Burn, burn, burrrrrn. Ha, ha, ha. Burn you racist bitch!
Ha, ha, ha.
But she wasn't quite dead. She jumped up from the bed
And I grabbed my Louisville Slugger that she had bought
Me for my twelfth birthday and I came up behind her and
I hit her, I hit her, I hit her twice. Ha, ha, ha.
Now she was out.
I went into the kitchen
And I got that handy carving knife
That we only use on special occasions like
Bullshit Thanksgiving, and I took her and I laid her ol'
Fucked up corpse on the floor and I cut her in
Little bitty pieces. Cut off her arms, her feet,
Her neck, and I put her into little green hefty bags
And I put it into my car and I said, ""Momma, we're goin' on
A vacation, a permanent vacation bitch.""
I took some of her around the world to Arizona, New York,
Chicago, Atlanta, Miami, Oakland. Ha, ha, ha, yo, you
Want to go to Connecticut, bitch. Ohio, Detroit, Texas, L.A.
Whose laughin' now momma, whose laughin' now bitch,
Whose laughin' now.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

So if you got a mutha or a grandmutha or a father
Who wants to carry on the same racist bullshit that's
Fucked this world up from day one,
You can either look 'em in the face and tell 'em to
Suck your dick or do like Body Count does.

Someone you can id with, how?
When you and I come from two totally polar opposite lifestyles.
Under normal circumstances I would be
Waking you and your rich parents up at gunpoint.
Demanding the combination to the wall safe.
While your little sister screams suffering from pistol-whipped pain.
Or looking back at you in a courtroom
Filled with absolutely none of my peers.
Why are you here? Is this some voyeuristic bullshit?
See black man sing?
Or maybe, just maybe, you've been subjected to so many audio drive by's
And gang shootings that you yourself have
Become numb to the pain like me.
And you, check this out, have become
Insane from overdoses of reality.
Well stomach this, at the rate we're
Going right now white boy, yeah you, you
And I will die holding each other's throats.
That's real, the world's at war, we're at war.
Check yourself, don't be me check your goddamn self.
It's goin' down 1997, see the light, red
Lasers rip through my neighborhood at night, time is short.
Homocide is the number one sport.

Last days,
Last days,
These are the last days.

So now that all the reality's soaked, I and
You start to reanalyze every word I ever said, am I a racist?
Or am I just someone who tells it how the fuck it is?
Well the truth of the thing is I was raised on crime.
Walking through an environment so filled with so much hate,
Honesty I do not feel that you are able to
Comprehend the magnitude of the evil.
But trip this, there were no white faces there.
Just black on black genocide.
The only white men there were the cops
That showed up late in the fourth to outline
The teenaged bodies in chalk.
So who do I hate? Do I hate you? Do I hate myself?
Or possibly am I intelligent enough to only
Hold the conditions of the ghetto itself to blame? - Not!
Who creates the conditions?
Who stops affirmative action and welfare?
Who loves the 3 strikes law?
Didn't see 'em at the Million Man March,
Or the three hundred and fifty-thousand
Man march, let your daddy tell it.
There's a lotta lies out there, what side ya on?
Armageddon is near,
I am the fourth rider of the apocalypse, recognize game.

Last days, these are the last days.
Last days, these are the last days.
Last days, these are the last days.
Last days.

(But maybe I'm all wrong, maybe everything is ok.
Maybe we're all just gonna get along.
Maybe I'm trippin', maybe life is perfect - yeah right)

I hate you, you hate me, and what does that equal?
It equals nothing, and that's exactly what we're gonna have,
Nothing, I we don't make a change soon,
And who am I to tell you anything?
I ain't nobody but a brother from South Central,
Who's had the opportunity to go around the world,
And I found out that we're all not really that different.

There's only one race, the human race,

Another mother cries every motherfucking night
Ghettoes of deep crack, made to never escape
A place to store the poor, made to never escape
They're all over the world, people go to die
Murders go unsolved, I understand why
They remove hope and then we sell dope
Pain in poverty has us at each other's throat
Families are broken and so we gang bang
A bit form of unity but most love some of us ever seen

And this is how we die

And this is why we ride

Oh man, coming up and surviving in the ghetto
The smallest argument goes from little drama to big drama 
Next thing you know, somebody's dead
I don't think you can understand if you've never been in your streets 
And held your best friend in your arms
Your child in your arms and watch them breathe their last breath 
'Cause somebody shot them dead in the streets 
You ain't thinking of calling the police
You want revenge and you want it now 
I gotta be honest with you 
If somebody were to kill me, shoot me right now, 
My last words wouldn't be peace 
It would be get those motherfuckers

I keep my doors locked, windows shut, shades down, so pound

When I do sleep I dream about pain and unrest
About gunfights and dum-dums exploding my chest
I see my boys that've died sitting with me again
And when I wake I realize that I've lost most of my friends
Will my past come back to get me?
Will them bosses that we shot come back to wreck me?

About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?
I grow up and you think the hippies would dig me
I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

CHORUS
And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

Mama aan de lijn, zij laat tranen los
Want ze ziet me op TV, en dat maakt d'r trots
Met mijn vader heb ik vaak gebotst
Terwijl ik gisteren zijn lievelingswagen kocht
Ik post niks, ik bewaar mijn trots
Ze wouden mij zien vallen, maar ik sta d'r nog
Ben je skeer is er niks meer dan hoop
Want succes dat ligt niet in de winkel te koop
Maar zeg mij wie is daar als je ligt in de goot
Ik ging spitten enzo, en die shit werd beloond
Ik duw, ik trek, ik ren
Geef een PS aan een fan
Ah, al die mannen hebben niks op mij
Omdat ik vroeger altijd dit al zei

Een miljonair
Dat is wat ik word, ik kom van ver
Op een dag dan word ik miljonair-air-air-air
Op een dag dan word ik miljonair-air-air-air
Op een dag dan word ik miljo-nair-nair, nair-nair
Op een dag dan word ik miljo-nair-nair, nair-nair",Miljonair,2018

[Verse]
Tuurlijk zie jij de shine, maar nooit zag jij de pijn
Zonder ouders ik was klein, ongeveer een jaar of nine
Wanneer d'r iets verdwijnt sla je dat op in je mind
En me oom die sloeg me tante maar zo wou ik niet zijn
Was gedoemd om te falen als me moeder en me vader
Vader zat in jilla, met hem kon ik niet praten
Me moeder dronk een glaasje, en niet van die water
Ik zag haar als een leeuwin maar ze leefde met een kater
En ik zweer ik moet het maken is wat ik zei in mijn kamer (kamer)
Kwam ik door je deur was het niet om te beramen (never)
Ik hoef me niet schamen voor de dingen die ik deed
Want al heb je lege magen is het honger dan dat spreekt
Maar goed, jaar of 10 en ik wou me vader zien (zien)
Ik had zoveel vragen vriend die ik aan me knagen liet
Zocht een uitweg met muziek ik bereikte een publiek
En nu steel ik al die shows maar ik was altijd al een dief
Waar is mama, waar is papa, waarom ben ik in me eentje (waarom)
Waarom is hij rijk en waarom heb ik niks te eten (niks)
Ik zat in mijn kamer, weet nog hoe ik heb gebeden
Hopelijk word ik die gene maar ik heb het in mijn genen
Vaak problemen met justitie als we zochten naar vellen
Als ze me stopten in cellen was niemand om me te helpen (niemand)
In die tijd was er geen hoop, het was struggle en vechten
Elke ochtend werd ik wakker en begon weer hetzelfde, hah
Inmiddels veertien, moet zorgen voor mijn eigen saaf
Mij ga je niet meer skeer zien al moet ik over lijken gaan
Ruzie met je vrouwtje dat moet zeker over liken gaan
Als zij tegen je uit wilt snap ik niet dat jij nog blijft bij haar (hoe dan)
Ik we-ik werk niet voor een baas ik word een eigenaar (eigenaar)
Soms deed ik fucked up en vond ik me eigen naar (fucked up)
Ik ben op cijfers, klaar, al moet ik naar bajes gaan
Zien ze mij voor gajes aan, is dat dan hoe ze mij zien? (mij zien)
Jaar of vijftien, Mootje liet een pijp zien
Hij zei me als je seerde, dan ga je mama blij zien
Hoe meer ik ook riskeerde, hoe meer kon ik d'r pijn zien
Money maakt je blind, ik ging verder in die crime scene
Dus ik werd zestien, belande in detentie
Overval, je ging gestrekt vriend
Werd verdacht van .16 (woo)
Ik kwam in me cel en ik dacht ik schrijf een zestien
Rappen op de groep jongens zeiden jij bent heavy
Jaar of zeventien ik dacht alleen aan stelen vriend (stelen)
Reed een Vespa, in mijn hoofd had ik al Range verdiend (skrr)
Was met een bitch in die tijd maar ze meende niet
Omdat ik zonder paper liep maar ewa dat moest zo zijn (ewa ja)
Jaar of achttien en weer was ik verdacht vriend
Officier gaf advies en rechter gaf me straf vriend (straf)
Ik moest met Koevoet even op vakantie
Ik ben zo weer thuis maar zo verliep het plan niet, nee
Slecht nieuws voor de vrouw die mij had opgevoed
Want zij kreeg kanker en moest daarvoor naar onderzoek
Ik zat tussen muren maar ik wist het toen al dondersgoed
Als ik haar ooit nog levend zag dat ik hopen op een wonder moest (ha)
En dat gebeurde met een hele hoop gezeik (gezeik)
Kreeg ik vijf dagen verlof wat ik herinner van die tijd
Dat zij lag op d'r sterfbed creperend van de pijn (pijn)
En ze keek me huilend aan: 'Beloof me dat je iets bereikt'
Terug naar de bajes met belofte op zak
Ook met wat hasj in me buik, wat als dat bolletje knapt (wat dan)
Wat ik toen nog niet besefte dat ik teksten van goud had (goud)
Jouw flow is altijd dood net als Kenny in South Park
Ze willen aan me trekken ik heb God als mijn houvast
We luisteren Tupac en we schreeuwen hier outlaws
Ik had geen ouders om te zeggen wat fout was
Nu breng ik vuur voor elke dag dat het koud was
Het is best wel knap als je het maakt en niet breekt
Riva zei me altijd wat je rapt dat maken we mee
Frenchie zei me als je rapt broer dan maak je ons heet
Bij m'n allereerste sessie zat ik zwaar in de kweek (wierie)
Maar als ik niet zou rappen was dat zwaar een mistake
Ik zei ooit word ik de beste, ik ben aardig op dreef (ha)
Praten over mij maar zelf maak je niks mee
Ik neem een pof van mijn assie en denk na in mijn Range

Boel Dirke,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You,1992
Boel Dirke,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1992

You can buck if you want to buck mothafucka (git gone) 
And be an example for them other suckers (gone gone)

I really ain't givin' a fuck and even if I did,
I still wouldn't even hesitate to split yo wig, pop back
In the whip like ain't nothin' happened 
It'll appear as magic I disappear in traffic,
A lot of folks goin' hate 'cause they know I'm a fool
And they know I'm the shit, I finally got out the school,
If I spit out the tools, I'll spit out the blues,
Don't bug it and confuse, I will not lose,
I come through on shoes and why two hoes choose,on you
Know who,I have no clue, 
I just do what I do, I just know what I know,
I'm a tell you once nigga don't fuck wit Bo

I'll hit yo ass so hard, feel like tearin' midgets,

But I don't take deadly threats so likely,I'm a G,take
It to the streets, it's about to go down when I pull the heat,
If you can't stand my click you can kiss my ass (kiss ma ass)
Fuck around make you jump in the grass,

When I was small I seen mama in the freezer with a ice cream jug 
Worth more than the visa she used to hide the money in the ceiling 
Having stacks on deck now that's a mighty good 
Feelin' fuck the days I'm gettin' paid by da hour 
Been in the wood to long for da shit to go sour 
When da feign come i'm a give em what da want 
The definition of customize now put that in yo trunk 
If I ain't got g's i'm a get it from the streets leavin'
A.v.e's offa zone 3 on da corner wit da g's 
That's how its gon be my whole family in hood 
Surrounders gotta eat gotta dough connect

And my daughters is too 
Just think of all the thousands of dollars we run through

That I ain't neva' seen a key I was sellin' break down back 
When dey made lean on me now I got dat bling on me 12 carat ring 
On me yellow black charger dats my waffle house machinery feds

And he had a leg for every limb
Now he's got no legs at all
They're both shot away with a cannonball
Well were you drunk or were you blind
To leave your two fine legs behind
Or was it from walking upon the sea
That took your legs from the ground to the knee
I wasn't drunk and I wasn't blind
To leave my two fine legs behind
Was a cannonball on the fifth of May
Took my two fine legs away
And all the foreign wars I'll now denounce
'Twixt this king of England or that king of France
I'd rather my legs as they used to be
Than the king of Spain and his whole navy
For I was tall and I was slim
And I had a leg for every limb
Now I've got no legs at all
You can't win a race with a cannonball

Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon

Who's Sorry Now?
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?
Who's sad and blue?
Who's crying too?

Just like a friend,
I tried to warn you somehow.
You had your way,
Now you must pay;

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2007

Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know

Lately I find you're on my mind

Keep 'em with heat in case they involve gats

Don't paid to get dirt done, now what you call that?

Hold it down control the frequency in cash and sex 
Another beat, hit the street, neat deposit the checks 
Baby girl freaked it and ?stump? in those discotechques

But these MC's steady schemin lookin all down our throat 
Organized and Ill Rahlos got your bubble on float 
Now think about but overall nigga consider it broke

in the chamber of the cockback, waiting to be fragnated 
Just in case it's deadly the occupied skated 
Then faded into a state, that made them obligated to wild

rapid fire Star Trek phaser, ain't nuttin over here

De ganarse a cada paso la vida

Con experiencia sedienta, ambición de llegar
De cebollita soñaba jugar un mundial
Y consagrarse en primera

Sembró alegría en el pueblo
Rego de gloria este suelo

Carga una cruz en sus hombros
Por ser el mejor, por no venderse jamás
Al poder enfrento, curiosa debilidad
Si Jesús tropezó por que el no habría de hacerlo

La fama le presento una blanca mujer
De misterioso sabor y prohibido placer
Que lo hizo adicto al deseo de usarla
Otra vez involucrando su vida

Y es un partido que un día
El Diego puede ganar

Leaving bodies at a party, cause somebody gotta pay

All you remember is a barrel and a mouth full of gold
Spreading terror on the street like they was in the past

And I never feel sorry for a sucker I gained on
Any slick talker, yo, he's bound to get rained on
At any Farmers party at my side is a Mag

I want to crawl inside your head
To kiss your mind and lips of red
I dig the things you do to me

Underneath hot white light
Give a scream
Take us up into the sky

Wonder why,
We could live a life that's never satisfied

For life's just one of the games we play
There is no special way

Everything will come in time.

Don't just left life pass you by

Can never last
When you find yourself still livin' in the past

Los bajos de esta canción
En este momento no me hace falta inspiración
 
Viernes otra vez y caí en cuenta
Caerse con dolor y levantarte cuesta
Tiren sus apuestas, que yo le voy a ésta
Andaba por ahí con mis sueños en la cuesta
Al fin sabes lo que quieres y es muy sencillo 
Caminando tranquilo sin nada en los bolsillos
Muchas veces nos caímos contra el piso
Y nadie me avisó, yo hice caso omiso
Te chocas contra el mundo si un par de veces
Te rompe tu por dentro y luego crece
Crece, y no se desaparece y no porque es necesario
Sino por que lo mereces
 
Si estoy diciendo lo que tengo que decir
Así es el camino y lo tengo que seguir
 
Qué bonito este camino que ahora andamos caminando
Como si fuera el destino tú vas comunicando
De vez en cuando se te van las ganas
Pero ahí es cuando más hay que pelear por la mañana
Mañana cuando te levantes en tu cama
La vida te devuelve aquello que no esperabas 
Y buscabas por andar desesperada, 
Un día te despiertas en tu propio cuento de hadas
Y no es difícil curar cicatrices 
De esos momentos malos y de otros más felices
Miles de pensamientos se me vienen con certeza
Yo también salí corriendo y me dí duro en la cabeza
Sólo me queda pensar en lo que he vivido
Los momentos disfrutados y el tiempo compartido
Ya todos esos miedos han desaparecido
Que valió la pena to’ lo que hemos recorrido
 
Si estoy diciendo lo que tengo que decir
Así es el camino y lo tengo que seguir
Aquí estoy diciendo lo que tengo que decir
Así es el camino y lo tengo que seguir
 
Vamos otra vez si
Estoy buscando una razón para gritarte
Hacerte caer en cuenta y luego levantarme
Nada complicado, sólo encontrarnos
A veces con mirar yo, puedo tocarte
 
Late mi corazón
Los bajos de esta canción
En este momento no me hace falta inspiración
 
A veces me quejo, a veces me dejo
A veces por las noches, yo me miro en el espejo
Y me quedo ahí sin nada para decir
Pero satisfecha porque soy feliz
Hice lo que quise porque yo lo quise así
Dije lo que dije, lo que tenía que decir
Miles de momentos y kilómetros de historia
Muchos pensamientos guardados en la memoria
Gente que te hiere, gente que te apoya
Mucha información, es que no basta esta canción ni este momento

Más de uno, más de dos

But believe in yourself even if your own mother begins to doubt you

And take everyone you love and write them down
You might not want to tell all of them, cuz that could wierd some people out
But let them know you care somehow

Now hold the one you love in both your hands
Apologise for what you did and he will understand
And if he doesn't, well fuck him, you've done all you can

But I just want to say 'Thank You'
For all the times that you stayed by my side
What a wonderful feeling to feel like everything is right
What a wonderful feeling to know that everything is fine

Keep your family close
'Cause when you get in trouble they'll be the last to lose their hope

And say your prayers every night
They don't have to be to God, it just helps to sort the thoughts
And you never know, they might be right

Now if I die tomorrow, would you say nice things?
Or would you tell the truth, even if it sounds a little mean
So if I'm remembered, I'm remembered realistically

But if there's something you want with all your heart
That you want so much, it's tearing you apart
Well don't try to kill the fire, it has to go out on it's own

Say Lil' Kevin Boy, you know I'm still makin' moves with thugs 

Part two nigga, ha ha all dem thugs get em up out there nigga 
I leave the house ten o'clock and jump in my lac
Call my niggas fiend N Mac 'cause they got my back 
And even the one time you was tryin' to hack 
I still pack a strap and recock my gat
Eliminatin' all my enemies tryin' to blind me
I'm still makin' moves but it's hard to find me 
Steadily gettin' richer pursuin' my dreams
I just cashed a check for three million D's
I told why all niggas last year don't play no games
Got dem no limit niggas out there callin' my name
Went from sneakin' in stores to dem sell out shows 
Went from crime to rhyme already did my time 
I say you don't want to go to war wit me
I got hot boy n' big swoll wit me
Just some more ghetto muthafuckas ridin' wit me 
'Cause makin' moves wit thugs is a hobby
 
[Chorus]
 
All my homies know that deal 
If you thuggin' keep it real 
Don't forget to pack that steel
In case we got some caps to peel
You know that deal this thug's for real 
We pack that steel, got caps to peel 

How many niggas want to ride wit me? 
Throw a party thug girls get wild wit me, 
It's involved wit green nigga bother P 
Fifty-six million like they lottery, 
From the Charlotte Hornets to MTV 
How many patnas do you see when I'm on TV? 
And if I get cut I'm gonna buy that team
'Cause I made my money from that triple beam 
I lived that life of a dealer nigga hangin' wit killas
I fucked around and come back to slangin' keys
But that's alright cause these niggas get paid 
Young niggas gonna be thugs to the grave

Bombay S. Jayashri,"The night is gone
The time has come
To find a new day has begun
An' it promises to stay
To soothe the pain of wasted years
An' kiss away the bitter tears
A love to light the way

And from the darkness
Comes a smile
That reaches out for many miles
Touching everyone
No more shadows of the past
Your spirit free to fly at last
Shining in the sun

Like the rolling thunder
I feel the power of love
It's a gift from heaven
And the Lord above

We walk toward desire
Hand and hand
Through fields of fire
With only love to light the way
On the road to Judgment Day

Take it easy, take it slow
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go
Places never seen before
'Cause I love you, an' I need you
I'll do my best to please you
My love can open any door

When you hear the thunder
In your darkest night
I'll be there to hold you
When the lightning strikes

So don't you worry,
You can ease your mind
'Cause we'll be dancing
At the end of time

Who loves you, who needs you
Who'll do his best to please you
I love you, I need you
I'll get down on my knees

We walk toward desire
Hand and hand
Through fields of fire
With only love to light the way
On the road to Judgment Day

So don't you worry, baby
On the road to Judgment Day
Who loves you, who needs you
On the road to Judgment Day

So I love you, and I need you

My love can open any door",Kuzhaloodhi,2008

And no one could take it away

Bomfunk MC's,"Da poetry
By now you should know it's me
The brother of word
Giving thanks and praises
To so many names and faces
In different places
From '84 to '99
It's been a very long time
Since the movement called hip-hop arrived
To this cold country of mine
Seen the old, the new
And now the true school
And for once I can say
Something has changed
Or is it just me
In the place to be (hardcore)
Am I about to take it in my face
Question, where were you at at the time of the fat shoelaces
When the hell was really raised, huh
I know every face
Writers, breakers, DJ's, MC's, Fly girls
Representing, respecting, unwritten laws
Rules, star wars
But even though
There's one thing I know
And it's been said before
Eliminate the distance
It's not where you're from, it's where you at
Mentally
The poetry
Enough love, peace and respect
Come correct
You gotta pay your dues
If you've got something to prove
It is a competition
Cause the business side can't see the mission
a-k-a the be	-boy vision
Two thousand and still counting

Yo it S-you-see-K-S
And I gotta run but come for the Bomfunk crew
So you'd better listen if you don't want to be missing
The perfect combination on a mission to rock the dancefloor
To hit you right where it hurts, I'll leave you begging for more

Gotta have some and put the rest to the trunk
We deliver the brand new formula

Piece of this you ask what it is
It's the way of the flow that throws away you missories

It's a effect of direct approach that you cope even if ya ruffneck
The ingredients - hard funk dividends
Make you move even if you don't wanna dance

Spread all around all the major cities

You feel the shakes - transform aches

So make a room, make a room, make a room now

You gotta learn to live

Life can kill you, it's written on you
But who is writin' struck by lightning
Pop you gone changed, who planned it
What planet? I thought I had it, damn it
Amazing craze lost in a speed chase
My mind is a blur, foxy ladies fake like the fur
Words occur, reporters need more germs for terms
To sell well and excellence is just an expense
For what it's worth, it makes no sense
Living a lie under magnifying lens
It gets intense, so you promise yourself
Not to hate it but fade it 'cause it really could be devastated
Re-evaluated, it's a game and you play it
You can say what you will but it always will be speculated
Turned around so the truths not found
Instead of your story it's a new compound

You gotta live your life,
You got to find your own way
You gotta learn to live,
And make your own decisions
You gotta live your life ,
That is how the story goes
You gotta learn to give,
Life is hard we all know

Spill your guts out, heard you talking 'bout
The way we changed 'cause we got some money now
Burning bridges, fuckin' bitches
So much snii that my nose is uplifted
Rumors going around talk of the whole town
Strange peeps comin' up you better slowdown
It gets weird, so watch yourself
Evil lurks within, it might take your health
I've seen men twice as tough come and go
No hard shoulder, just the elbow
The mental state of slave,
Camouflaged in a gansta teenage behave
Hold it, wait no need to go that route, doubt

Get it together, it's all in your mind

Rocking and shocking the hops the hips

The sound, the scratch, electroclash, the revelation, kickin' ya ass!!
The new phenomenon taking over town,
Feel the force, coming over ground.

It feels so good to be alive:

It's been so long since I felt this good inside

I ain't gonna rush, gonna take my time

Gonna drink my coffee in the warm sunshine

A little vacation in my own backyard

I ain't gonna worry an' I don't have to be anywhere:

I think I'll kick around in my robe

I ain't gonna put a lick of make up on my face

Yeah, I might just pull out my old guitar,

Just to see if I've still got what it takes

That honeysuckle summer breeze,

Gonna take it all in, it smells so sweet

Tomorrow's gonna be here soon enough


But today ain't my day to care

I'll have me a pitcher of Bloody Marys before noon if I want to

I ain't gonna worry an' I don't have to be anywhere:

Ain't my day to care


I'm gonna tend to my soul, pamper myself,

Let it all go, get it all out

It's about time,

I spent a little time on me


Today ain't my day to care

I'll have me a pitcher of mamosas before noon if I want to

And some big ol' guy just walked on by with a devil tattoo and an earring in his nose
Well I tried to introduce myself but no one took the time to say hello

And I couldn't help but wonder what would make a guy wanna wear women's clothes
When finally a real man sat next to me and ordered a tequila
He turned and smiled and shook my hand and said hi there, my name is Sheila

He said I heard you from across the room - is that what they call a mountain music song
He said I must admit I laughed at first, then I found myself singin' along

In the power of one, oh

All the little things we do everyday
The smallest step can bring on a change
Oh, that's the power of one

One single spark can light the night
One simple dream, one gentle word

One act of love from someone
Can start a chain reaction
It all begins in the heart

The power of one, the power of one

I won't be showing off to often at sixty five
This butterfly tattoo might be something I tell my kids not to do
Spring break shouldn't last the rest of your life
There were things I should not have done
Then again, well, I sure had fun

Being free, being wild, being bulletproof
Back then we were rebels without a clue
Nothing in the world that we wouldn't do
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Didn't give a damn what people say
We were doing it, doing it our way
I wish that we could always stay
Nineteen and crazy

I fall in love with those guys that keep my dad awake at night
Running his knife across a red stone
Maybe he hates their long hair
The tattoos or the chains that they all wear
Mostly he hates your black Camero
We were young so in love and we still haven't grown up

Being free, being wild, being bulletproof
Back then we were rebels without a clue
Nothing in the world that we wouldn't do
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Didn't give a damn what people say
We were doing it, doing it our way
I wish that we could always stay

Oh the only things that I regret are the things that we didn't do
Those crazy days (those crazy days) that I have left (that I have left) have led me here to you, oh

Being free, being wild, being bulletproof
Right now, we're rebels without a clue
Nothing in the world that we can't do

In a bar, breathing smoke
Snorting whiskey, drinking coke
It was a time when no-one would die
And there wasn't a care

Sometimes I wish it was that way
'cause sometimes I have to get away

[Chorus]

This guy turns around
And he's pointing up the stairs
I found myself in her doorway
But there wasn't anybody there
She walked in the room
With nothing on but a red light
And with a smile she got so close to me
And whispered something 'bout midnight
You know I didn't understand a word she said
But it felt so good
She knew that I didn't have any money
But baby I knew she would

[Chorus: x2]",Tokyo Road,1985
Bon Jovi,"If you could see inside my heart
Then you 'd understand
I'd never mean to hurt you
Baby I'm not that kind of man

I might not say I'm sorry
Yeah, I might talk tough sometimes
And I might forget the little things
Or keep you hanging on the line

In a world that don't know Romeo and Juliet
Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget
We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets
Into the fire we cry

I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
I'd do anything
I'd lie for you
You know it's true
Baby I'd die for you
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
If it came right down to me and you
You know it's true, baby I'd die for you

I might not be a savior
And I'll never be a king
I might not send you roses
Or buy you diamond rings

But if I could see inside you
Maybe I'd know just who we are
'Cause our love is like a hunger
Without it we would starve

In a world that don't know Romeo and Juliet
Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget
We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets
Into the fire we cry

And if I could have one wish come true
I wish everyday could be full of peace and harmony
I wish everyday could be like Christmas, I do

I saw a child sit with old Mr. Claus
Looked him in the eye and he asked old Santa what peace on earth was
Now the old man grew cautious on how he would say
That is the greatest gift, one you can give everyday

I wish everyday could be like Christmas
And if I could have one wish come true
I wish everyday could be full of peace and harmony
I wish everyday could be like Christmas, I do

Now the mistle-toe and the house a-glow
All the world seems at ease tonight
And all that I ask when these precious moments pass
Is why can't every day be so bright?

I wish everyday could be like Christmas
And if I could have one wish come true
I wish everyday could be full of peace and harmony
I wish everyday could be like Christmas, I do
Honest I do, yes I do now
Very merry Christmas",I Wish Everyday Could Be Like Christmas,1987
Bon Jovi,"You need someone to make it last
No Romeos who'll love and leave you fast

I'm gonna take you all the way tonight
I like 'em down and dirty, hold on tight

Come on get ready

You're looking sharp in your dancing shoes
You got the style and you got the moves
Oh you're so hot, girl and on the loose
You're caught up in a danger zone
Just seventeen but you act full grown
The nightlife is turning you on
You want to take me all the way tonight
Take my hand, you can feel the heat
Make you feel alright

Bon Jovi,"Shot through the heart it's all part of the game we call love

Would you be content to see me crying
After all those little games you put me through?
After all I've done for you you're lying
Wouldn't it be nice to tell the truth?

Didn't somebody somewhere say
You're gonna take a fall?
I gave you everything
Now here's the curtain call

Shot through the heart as I lay there alone in the dark
Through the heart it's all part of the game we call love

Now you've come back here to say you're sorry
But I just don't know who you're talking to
It could be the man I used to be, girl
But I've grown up and now I'm over you

Standing there just a livewire
With nowhere left to turn
You were gonna set the world on fire
When will you ever learn?

Shot through the heart as I lay there alone in the dark
Through the heart it's all part of the game we call love

Didn't somebody somewhere say
You're heading for a fall?
I gave you everything
Now here's the curtain call
And I'm shot

When it's down to you and I
When the sun appears
And there's nothing left but good-byes
We'll just turn and walk away
How could we let it end like this
Just turn and walk away
Should we seal it with a kiss

It's too late
Now you're out and on the run
It's too late
Held up in love without a gun

[Chorus:]
Silent night
We hold up our candle light
Silent night
The night our love died
No words to say
And we're both too tired to fight
Just hold me close and don't let go

It was all so simple when
You were to be queen and I'd be your king
I guess those dreams got lost
Cause baby you're still you and I'm still me
Now letting go
It's always the hardest part to fight
When we both know
We're just two more victims of the night

It's too late
Too late to wonder why
Much too late
To save a love that's died.

I'm gonna see those senoritas lying under the sun
Yeah they're greasing it up with their stereos on
You know I want to be their blanket, gonna tell every girl
Hey baby you're the one

Whoa, tell the boys I'm on my way
I got the radio blasting in my old man's Chevrolet
I got a party in my pocket,
And you know I just got paid

When the sun goes down, that's when the street heats up
Senorita, margarita, fills your empty cup tonight
She makes me feel so right 
A good time here doesn't cost much money
Just a little sweet talking, let the pretties in the party
And you're set for life
Or one hell of a night

I can see those sons of beaches
With the surf and the sand and they're living it up
Yu know life ain't so tough
So get me in the action
Gotta tell every girl she's the one

Haven't changed, had much to say,
But man, I still think them cats are crazy.
They were askin' if you were around,
How you was, where you could be found.
Told them you were livin' downtown,
Drivin' all the old men crazy.

The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town.
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town.

You know that chick that used to dance a lot,
Every night, she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she's got.
Man, when I tell ya she was cool, she was red hot.
And that time over at johnny's place,
Well, this chick, she got up and slapped johnny's face,

Man, we just fell about the place,
If that chick don't want to know, forget her.

The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town.
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town.

Friday night they'll be dressed to kill,
Down at deano's bar and grill
The drink will flow, and blood will spill,
And if the boys want to fight you better let 'em.
That jukebox in the corner blasting out my favorite song,
The nights are gettin' warmer, it won't be long,
Won't be long 'til summer comes,
Now that the boys are here again.

Bon Jovi,"We would take no prisoners
'Cause there was nobody giving in
They came walking through my jungle
And met an angel about to sin
I heard a voice from inside of me
When the youth of america cried:
Can you help me, hear me call

I don't wanna fall (I don't wanna fall)
I don't wanna fall (I don't wanna fall)
To the fire
I don't wanna fall (I don't wanna fall)

When you're a part of society
You know, the heart of your innocence dies
When we met with authority
I looked him right between the eyes
'Cause all we had was our innocence
All we had was our hearts to try to win the fight you tell me...
Can you save me, from it all

I don't wanna fall (I don't wanna fall)

I thought it was my own
I could feel it in my heartbeat
I could feel it in my bones
My momma thinks I'm crazy
My dad says I'm insane
I got this boogie woogie fever
That's burning in my veins

They tried to take me to a doctor
But it's too late for me
Then they took me to a preacher
That they saw on their tv
Who said that for a small donation
My lost soul would be saved
I said I don't think so preacher
I'll come back another day

All I want, is to be a rolling stone
They don't understand what we all know

It feels so good that it ought to be illegal
I got my vaccination from a pornograf needle
I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old
Blame it on the love of rock & roll

My teachers didn't like me they always
Tried to put me down
'Cause I wore my hair too long
I played my music way too loud

Every little boy wants to learn to play guitar
So he can pick up all the chicks
And be a rock-n-roll star

They said it won't last, but they misunderstood
If people think it's bad then I'll be bad for good

It feels so good that it ought to be illegal

Bon Jovi,"Across the border they turn water into wine
Some say it's the devil's blood
They're squeezing from the vine
Some say it's a savior
In these hard and desperate times
You see it helps me to forget that we're just born
To die

I came here like so many did to find a better life
To find my piece of easy street
To finally be alive
And I know nothing good comes easy
All good things take some time
I made my bed I'll lie in it
To die in it's the crime

You can't help but prosper
Where the streets are paved with gold
They say the oil wells ran deeper here than anybody's known
Now I packed up on my wife and kid
And left them both back at home
See there's nothing in this pay dirt
The ghosts are all I know

Now the oil's gone
And the money's gone
All the jobs are gone
Still we're hangin' on

Down in dry county
They're swimming in the sand
Praying for some holy water
To wash the sins from off our hands
Here in dry county
The promise has run dry
Where nobody cries
And no one's getting out of here alive (Not this time)

""In the blessed name of Jesus"" I heard a preacher say
That we are all God's children
And He'd be back, back someday
I hoped that he knew something as he drank that cup of wine
I didn't have too good a feeling as I head out to the night

I cursed the sky to open
I begged the clouds for rain
I prayed all night for water
For this burning in my veins
It was like my soul's on fire
And I had to watch the flames
All my dreams went up in ashes
And my future blew away

Now the oil's gone
And the money's gone
All the jobs are gone
Still we're hangin' on

Down in dry county 
They're swimming in the sand 
Praying for some holy water 
To wash these sins from off our hands
Here in dry county 
The promise has run dry 
Where nobody cries 
And no one's getting out of here alive 
						
Men spend their whole lives waiting 
Prayin' for some big reward 
But it seems sometimes the payoff 
Leaves you feeling like a dirty whore 
If I could choose the way I'd die 
Make it by the gun or knife 
'Cause the other way there's too much pain 
Night after night after night after night

Down in dry county
Where they're swimming in the sand 
Praying for some holy water 
To wash the sins from off our hands

""Do your time"" everybody's doing
their sentence
It's just there ain't nobody here

Just being here we're
breathing heart attacks
We can run and chase
The setting sun we can run
And we won't ever look back

Take my hand I know we'll make it
I'll let nothing slow us down
I know you want to curse
This place but there's only
One thing that's stopping us now

Fear fear fear
Of a new thing
Fear fear fear
Of the brass ring

You work and live and breathe that 9 to 5

That's surviving to me

And surviving is living to die in

What we need right now is, soul

I can't do this, you can't do that
They feed us lines but I won't act
And all good things will come to pass

And would you lie for it?

Are we the ones that put it there
Would you scheme for it
scream for it, bleed for it
Would you

Believe we're still worth
The fight you'll see
There's no hope for this world tonight

In record stores or magazines
Close your eyes and you will see

Was the night she said goodbye
She said that loves a stranger
And it's sure to pass you by, yes she did
As she packed up her belongings
Baby wouldn't look me in the eye
But I could see a tear roll
Off her face
As we both tried so hard
Not to cry she said

I never wanted the stars
Never shot for the moon
I like them right where they are
All I wanted was you
So baby just turn away
Because I can't face the truth
All I'm trying to say
Is all I wanted was you

I tried so hard to remember
Where when how why love went away
I tried to drown myself in pity
But your memory kept calling your name, yes it did

I bought you fancy cars and diamond rings, baby
All the things that money brings
And the servants to paint the sky blue
And I worked so hard seven days a week
And built a fortress for your heart to keep
If I could I'd wrap these words up for you

I never wanted the stars
Never shot for the moon
I like them right where they are
All I wanted was you
So baby just turn away

I want you, I want you, baby I want you

But never thought you were alone
I filled the party up with company
But never made our house a home

All I've got is my guitar these chords and the truth
All I've got is my guitar, but all, baby all I want

De casa nunca me alejo

Pues tan lejos estas hacia el norte o el sur,
Intento so??arte entre la multitud,
Mis ojos cerrar y decirte:
Solo tu amor es la luz

Quiero tener tu Amor entre vino y rosas
Y olvidar por fin el dolor de ayer
Cerca de ti, ser tu nombre, ser tu sombra,

Hacia un futuro desierto,

Que sea su payaso otra vez,
Yo, le digo, no
Si tengo tu amor no estoy solo,
Ella es soledad y t??

Would you feel alone in a world like this?
Did you ever feel like you needed shelter,
Did you ever laugh when you wanted to cry?
Did you ever dream about evolution,
Don't you ever feel like your living a lie?

Oh, whoa, too many children grow up blind to the truth.
I say, oh oh, oh, oh,
Say a prayer for me,
I'll save a prayer for you.

Did you ever feel like you were helpless,
Did you ever feel like an open wound?
Did you ever feel that there ain't no forgiveness,
Did you ever feel that close to the.truth.

Oh whoa, the world closed their eyes on the blinding truth.
I say, oh, oh, oh, oh , say a prayer for me,
And I'll save a prayer for you
I'll save a prayer for you, I'll save a prayer for you,
I'll save a prayer, for you, for you, for you.
I'll save a prayer.

Did you ever feel like you need shelter,
Did you ever feel like you lived through the flood?
Did you ever feel a lust for survival, did you ever feel, feel, feel?
The world keeps turning.
Rooms still burning.
There's too many hearts that haven't found a home.
This train's on the tracks and the world's on my back,
Save a prayer for me and I'll save one for you.

No one to blame , but it's hard to explain,
Why too many soul's are feeling so alone.
You've got to hold on if it's all you can do.

Bon Jovi,"Sitting here wasted and wounded
At this old piano
Trying hard to capture
The moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of vodka
Is still lodged in my head
And some blond gave me nightmares
I think she is still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist I wake up and
French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
Its own beat in my head
While we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and
What you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need

I want to lay you down on a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on bed of roses

Well I'm so far away
That each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night
Just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper,
Baby blind love is true

I want to lay you down on a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on bed of roses

The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died

When you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight I won't be alone
But you know that don't
Mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend

I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is

It's alright, just two hearts breaking even tonight

Yeah
Yeah

Oh I'm going, gonna walk out the door
Saying you don't care for me anymore
That's alright, just two hearts breaking even tonight",Hearts Breaking Even,1995
Bon Jovi,"I played the part of a broken heart upon a shelf
I played that part so lonely and so well
Thought that love belonged to someone else not me and you
Yeah, I know that you've been shattered , you been bruised
We both know what it feels like when you lose
But I'd bet my life on the roll of the dice for you

If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do
Tonight's the night, I'm gonna prove it to you
Do I have to break down, baby just to break through
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do
If that's what it takes

I bet you counted all the tears I bet you've cried
I bet you swore you'd never let love back inside
'Cause it hurt you way too bad to say good-bye
Now, there'll be times when I might put us to the test
And it's hard for broken hearts to just forget
But I'm driving blind, I'll lay it all on the line for you

If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do
Tonite 's the night, I'm gonna prove it to you
Do I have to break down, baby just to break through
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do
If that's what it takes

So, when you feel like jumping,
Just when your heart starts pumping
When you're standing out on that ledge-staring over the edge
I'll be there to talk you down, I'll be there before you hit the ground

If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do
Tonight's the night, I'm gonna prove it to you
Do I have to break down, baby just to break through
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do
If that's what it takes

If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do
If we take the time to do it right, I know we'll pull through
If it took all my life, I'd prove it to you
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do",If That's What It Takes,1995
Bon Jovi,"Rumour has it that your daddy's coming down
He's gonna pay the rent
Tell me baby, is this as good as life is gonna get
It feels like there is a stranger standing in these shoes
But, I know I can't lose me, 'cause then I'd be losing you

I know I promised baby
I would be the one to make our dreams come true
I ain't too proud of all the struggles
And the hard times we've been through
When this cold world comes between us
Please tell me you'll be brave

'Cause I can realize the danger when forgiveness fades away
If you don't love me, lie to me
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be
Right now if you don't love me baby, lie to me

Pour another cup of coffee, babe I got something to say to you
I ain't got the winning ticket
Not the one that's gonna pull us through
No one said it'd be easy, let your old man take you home
But know if you walk out on me
That darling, I'd be gone

If you don't love me, lie to me
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be
Right now if you can't love me baby, lie to me
Baby, I can take it

It's a bitch, but life's a roller coaster ride
The ups and downs will make you scream sometimes
It's hard believing that the thrill is gone
But we got to go around again, so let's hold on

If you don't love me, lie to me
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be
Right now if you can't love me baby, lie to me, lie to me
Baby I can take it",Lie to Me,1995
Bon Jovi,"Misery likes company I like the way that sounds
I've been trying to find the meaning 
So I can write it down
Staring out the window it's such a long way down
I'd like to jump but I'm afraid to hit the ground

I can't write a love song the way I fell today
I can't sing no song of hope
I've got nothing to say
Life is feeling kind of strange 
Since you went away
I sing this song to you wherever you are
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms

I'm tired of watching TV it makes me want to scream
Outside the world is burning 
Man it's so hard to believe
Each day you know you're dying 
From the cradle to the grave
I get so numb sometimes that I just feel the pain

I can't write a love song the way I feel today
I can't sing no song of hope 
I got nothing to say
Life is feeling kind of strange
Strange enough these days
I send this song to you whoever you are
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms

Staring at the paper I don't know what to write
I'll have my cigarette-well, turn out the lights
Maybe tomorrow I'll feel a different way
But here in my delusion I don't know what to say

I can't write a love song the way I feel today
I can't sing no song of hope
I've got nothing to say
And I can't fight the feelings 
That are burning in my veins
I send this song to you wherever you are
As my guitar lies bleeding

I can't write a love song the way I feel today
I can't sing no song of hope
There's no one left to save
And I can't fight the feelings buried in my brains
I send this song to you wherever you are 
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms",My Guitar Lies Bleeding in My Arms,1995
Bon Jovi,"Happiness, it's been no friend to me
But forever after ain't what it's all cracked up to be
Yeah, I had a taste, you were my fantasy
But I lost my faith when I hit reality
I don't need no Guru to tell me what to do
When your feeling like a headline on
Yesterday's news

Come on, come on, come on
Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when
I feel I've been danglin' from a hang-man's noose
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel all right,
Something like you

Loneliness has found a home in me
My suitcase and guitar are my only family
I've tried to need someone, like they needed me
I opened up my heart, but all I did was bleed
I don't need no lover, just to get screwed
They don't make a bandage, that's going to cover my bruise

Come on, come on, come on
Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when
I feel I've been danglin' from a hang-man's noose
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel all right
Something like you

Pull me under (Help I'm falling)
Run through my veins (Night is calling)
To a place (Feels like I'm flying)
Where I feel no pain (Christ I'm dying)
Be the pillow under my head
Cover me when I'm in your bed
Take me higher than I've ever been
Take me down and back again
Come to me, be my disguise
Open your coat, let me crawl inside
Come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on
Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when
I feel I've been danglin' from a hang-man's noose
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel all right,
Something like you",Something for the Pain,1995
Bon Jovi,"I lost all faith in my God, in his religion too
I told the angels they could sing their songs to someone new
I lost all trust in my friends
I watched my heart turn to stone
I thought that I was left to walk this wicked world alone

Tonight I'll dust myself off
Tonight I'll suck my gut in
I'll face the night and I'll pretend
I got something to believe in

And I had lost touch with reason
I watched life criticize the truth
Been waiting for a miracle
I know you have too

Though I know I won't win
I'll take this one on the chin
We'll raise a toast and I'll pretend
I got something to believe in

If I don't believe in Jesus, how can I believe the Pope
If I don't believe in heroin, how can I believe in dope
If there's nothing but survival, how can I believe in sin
In a world that gives you nothing
We need something to believe in

If I don't believe in Jesus, how can I believe the Pope
If I don't believe in heroin, how can I believe in dope
If there's nothing but survival, how can I believe in sin
In a world that gives you nothing
We need something to believe in",Something to Believe In,1995
Bon Jovi,"I was walking around, just a face in the crowd
Trying to keep myself out of the rain
Saw a vagabond king wear a Styrofoam crown
Wondered if I might end up the same
There's a man out on the corner
Singing old songs about change
Everybody got their cross to bare, these days

She came looking for some shelter with a suitcase full of dreams
To a motel room on the boulevard
Guess she's trying to be James Dean
She's seen all the disciples and all the wannabes
No one wants to be themselves these days
Still there's nothing to hold on to but these days

These days, the stars seem out of reach
These days, there ain't a ladder on these streets
These days, are fast, nothing lasts in this graceless age
There ain't nobody left but us these days

Jimmy shoes busted both his legs, trying to learn to fly
From a second story window, he just jumped and closed his eyes
His momma said he was crazy, he said, momma, I've got to try
Don't you know that all my heroes died
And I guess I'd rather die than fade away

These days, the stars seem out of reach
But these days, there ain't a ladder on these streets
These days are fast, love don't last in this graceless age
Even innocence has caught the morning train
And there ain't nobody left but us these days

I know Rome's still burning
Though the times have changed
This world keeps turning round and round and round and round
These days

These days, the stars seem out of reach
But these days, there ain't a ladder on these streets
These days are fast, love don't last in this graceless age
Even innocence has caught the midnight train
And there ain't nobody left but us these days

These days, the stars seem out of reach
These days, there ain't a ladder on these streets
These days, are fast, nothing lasts
There ain't no time to waste
There ain't nobody left to take the blame
There ain't nobody left but us these days",These Days,1995
