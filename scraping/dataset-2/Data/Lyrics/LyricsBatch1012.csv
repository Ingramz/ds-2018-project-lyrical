Siouxsie and the Banshees,"Hibiscus head-in a flower bed
A finger hewn-planted and sewn

Oh magic in her hands-she could make anything grow
Magic in her hands - she had green fingers

It's curious
Where animals don't go
Mandrake-rooted deep into the soil
Where the sun won't fall but it flourishes
See the pretty maids all in a row

[Chorus]

It's reaching
And groping a clammy handshake
Clawing the ivy
Crawling the tightrope along the lattice work
With this hand I thee wed
With this hand I thee bed
With this hand I",Green Fingers,1982
Siouxsie and the Banshees,"You are the melting men
You are the situation
There is no time to breathe
And yet one single breath
Leads to an insatiable desire
Of suicide... in sex 

So many blazing orchids
Burning in your throat
Making you choke
Making you sigh
Sigh in tiny deaths 

[Chorus]
So Melt!
My lover, melt!
She said melt!
My lover, melt! 

You are the melting men
And as you melt
You are beheaded
Handcuffed (in lace and blood and sperm)

Swimming in poison
Gasping in the fragrance
Sweat carves a screenplay
of discipline...and devotion 

[Chorus] 

Can you see?
See into the back of a long, black car
Pulling away from the funeral of flowers
With my hand between your legs
Melting...",Melt!,1982
Siouxsie and the Banshees,"Do you hear this breath it's an obsessive breath
Can you feel this beat it's an obsessive heart beat
Waiting to be joined with its obsession

I close my eyes but I can't sleep
The thin membrane can't veil
The branded picture of you 

The signs and signals show, the traffic lights say go
Again you baffle me pretending not to see, me

I broke into your room, I broke down in my room
Touched your belongings there, and left a lock of my hair
Another sign for you

You screamed into my face get the hell out of my place
Another sign for me? can you forgive me?
For not understanding your ways

You know sometimes you take it all too far
Then I remember it's a game between you and me
A divine test for us two

It's all in my imagination
Yes they even say that our mission, is only
My obsession

Do you hear this breath it's an oppressive breath
Suffocating in the poison of your obsession
Can you feel this beat it's a possessive beat
Your pulse stops in the claws of your obsession",Obsession,1982
Siouxsie and the Banshees,"On lead poisoned wings, you try to sing
Freak beak shrieks are thrown at your confusing hue
The peacock screaming eyes show no mercy oh, oh no mercy

Painted bird, it's absurd
Just a tainted bird hurting their twisted nerve

Painted bird, it's absurd
Just a tainted bird hurting their twisted nerve

The flock will make you choke on this sadistic joke
And the whippoorwills they make a din
In laughing unison, you're Hitchcock carrion
In laughing unison, you're Hitchcock carrion
Carry on

Painted bird, it's absurd
Just a tainted bird hurting their twisted nerve

Painted bird, it's absurd
Just a tainted bird hurting their twisted nerve

I hear your sorrow, may lose tomorrow
You'll lose you sorrow
When a fated weather will cleanse away
That painted feather and all that sorrow, sorrow, sorrow

A coquette in fur purr for the painted bird
Confound that dowdy flock with a sharp honed nerve
Because we're painted birds by our own design
By our own design, oh there's no more sorrow, sorrow, sorrow

Have you heard about the painted bird
Just a tainted bird hunting their twisted nerve

We've lost our sorrow, now it's tomorrow, tomorrow
No need to hide your feather under a fated weather
No more sorrow, sorrow
We've lost our sorrow

Now we're painted birds
Mocking that twisted nerve
It's absurd, it's absurd, painted bird
",Painted Bird,1982
Siouxsie and the Banshees,"In the heart of the night
She smiles like Mardi Gras
Spinning in a dizzy haze
Her circus head giggles
It's a friendly disease
Catching colors from the air

So with your hands upon the hips
Of the dancing flesh
She's a carnival
And when it's lip to lip
In a surprise-time kiss
She's a carnival
She's a carnival
She's a carnival

Mosaic eye, gypsy eye
Glowing as it dazzles
She's a portrait of a poison
For you to quench your thirst
A portrait of a poison

So with your hands upon the hips
Of the dancing flesh
She's a carnival
And when it's lip to lip
In a surprise-time kiss
She's a carnival
She's a carnival
She's a carnival

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"Git yer head down to the ground

Emit a howling sound

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"Look to the hills, now look at my face
Do you notice my eyes, are they in the right place?

There's a Mantovani backdrop to pucker up a tummy tuck
A voice soft as lint mashed up with shades of pink

Hide your genetics under drastic cosmetics
But this chameleon magic is renowned to be tragic

Look to the hills now look at my face
Do you notice my eyes are they in the right place?
",Paradise Place,1983
Siouxsie and the Banshees,"Tongues are clacking words of one vision
One tiny incision and teeth are cracking
On thin air, on thin air
And teeth are cracking on thin air

Pulled to bits in silence
Left rotting on the ground
Slowly pulled to bits in silence
Without a sound, without a sound

Buildings bleached with shatter, shatter, clatter
Fill their senses with cement
Watch the people scatter
One by one, one by one

Pulled to bits in silence
Left rotting on the ground
Slowly pulled to bits in silence
Without a sound, without a sound

Young lungs snapping coming up for air
The mindless ones yapping, slashing through the thoroughfare
One by one, one by one
Oh one by one without a fucking care

Pulled to bits in silence
Left rotting on the ground
Slowly pull to bits in silence
Without a sound, without a fucking sound

Pulled to bits, yackety, yackety, yack, yack, yack
Pulled to bits, shatter, shatter, shatter, clatter
Pulled to bits, yap, yap, yap, yapping
Pulled to bits without a sound

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"Different lives
In different places
Familiar problems
Same old faces

Shuffle lives
Into wrong categories
Cross the wires
And fuse humanities

Watch the muscles twitch
For a brand new switch...

Scientist G.P.'s
With patient guinea pigs
Curing their headaches
With drastic side-effects

Watch the muscles twich
For a brand new switch?

Doctor rectorates
Condescending from on high
For all hallucinators
See druggist in the sky

Vicar experiments
But it's blasphemy
Dismissing thought of progress
As the mark of devilry

And even talk
People listen
Then they halt

Won't come down

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"Sunrise breaks its fatal perfume
And I'm dizzy to distraction
The scented clutches of a siren's lament
Embrace the sound of enchantment

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"Weaving in his basket chair
'twist you round a lock of hair
Made of straw -- the wicker man
Made of straw -- I'll blow your house down
Bishops falling from the windows
The lightening makes your hair stand on end

This dervish frenzy -- will make you run around
This dervish frenzy -- will turn your head around
Blow the house down

Feel where we stand
Shift the ground -- caterpillar man
Crumbling castles in the sand
Blow the house down
Feebly we put our heads out of our foxy laire
We feel the chill from the night soare
Standing in the storm -- waiting for the flash to crash
Counting seconds before we turn to ash

It's getting nearer ...
Blow the house down
This dervish frenzy -- will turn your head around

Standing on the stairs that want to fall down
It's getting nearer don't turn your head around

Down to the ground

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"Following desire in your eyes
You're mine, you're mine all mine
Following the signs in your mind
You're mine, you're mine, all mine

Bring me the head of the preacher
Man in the sickening daze
O, the rotting sun washes down
The moonshine boys, the vultures drool

They pluck the gold dust from his eyes
And pick his bones until they're clean
The book of sorrows, the American dreams
Bring me the head of the preacher man

On the blazing trail
Heaven holds lone star promise El Dorado
The insane theater, once more we rise
To drain the last of liquid sleep

The gift of chance
Eating the worm as the vapor drops and dances
And everything stops and dances
Bring me the head of the preacher man
We tumble down these lonely days
",Bring Me the Head of the Preacher Man,1984
Siouxsie and the Banshees,"The stars that shine 
And the stars that shrink
In the face of stagnation the water runs
Before your eyes

Swallowing diamonds
A cutting throat
Your teeth when your grin
Reflecting beams on tombstones

A jamboree of surprises
Playing Russian roulette
Or the lucky dip
A clenched fist to your heart
Coal dust on your lungs

A silver tongue for the chosen one
Heavy magnum in your side
Or a bloody thorn

Skating bullets on angel dust
In the dead sea of fluid mercury
Baby piano crys
Under your heavy index and thumb
Pull some strings-let them sing

The stars that shine 
And the stars that shrink
In the face of stagnation the water runs

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"From the fury pit, a reek of misery
Like a trumpet groan, tornado moan
The splendor splits like a golden skin

He and the wizards cry like hummingbirds
In treasure glows, your weeping wings
And a slaughter grins, on a pleasure spike

When held on high by the riverside
Like a torn-throat child in a jackals hide
Cool water dies, vile diamond eyes

Silent in flamingo ease distant in troubled trance
Within a whirlpool, we're breaking our backs
The tears of the moon, the sweat of the sun
Sacrificial hearts for a pointing bone

With a gorgons head and a coal of skulls
They're kindling fires in open wounds
Pointing bone, in a jaguar skin, blood matted mane
Beacons blaze toward a waning moon

Rattlers at your feet

Dead before born 
Words fall in ruins - but no sound

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"A ravenous greed for a brood to feed
A lusting spawn on a weekend fawn
Do you hunger for this, hunger for this?

Sucking leaches feel the need
Sucking dry unsated stomach pops
Sharpened knives, oh, with flying sparks
Sagging bodies with stretch marks

And your belly aches
Do you hunger for this, hunger for this?
Hunger for this, bled white with avarice

As the rust creeps
Corrosion seeps a rotting seed
Eat me, oh, feed me
With your belching foul breath

Your destructive kiss, death
Do you hunger for this, hunger for this?
Hunger for this, just a taste of a sweet kiss

Shanghaied on a locust flight
And the thirst from a vampire bite
Fills the emptiness inside
Consuming everything green eyed
We hunger, we hunger

We are hunger for this
Hunger for this
Hunger for this
The bliss of a sweet kiss

Ready
Waiting
For the story to begin

Fringed in white
Breathing and living
And anticipating
A colour
All transformed to a fairytale
Unreal and inviting
Inviting you to step in
And follow the path neverending

you're now leaving

And somehow expecting
Expecting someone

maybe the prince in disguise
Suffering a snow queen curse
But you're wrong of course

The approaching disease, 92 degrees
The blood in our veins and the brains in our head
The approaching unease, 92 degrees

Long ago in the headlines, they noticed it too
But too late for the loved ones and nearly for you

Shaky lines on the horizon
Snakey thoughts invade each person
Watch the red line creeping upwards
Watch the sanity line weaken

The volcanic depths of Hades' ocean
Bubble under these crazed eruptions
It wriggles and writhes and bites within
Just below the sweating skin

I wondered when this would happen again
Now I watch the red line, reach that number again

Eat the cactus with bleeding mouth

Flames lick closer to the core
From city limits fireball
And in a headless chicken run

Race red and screaming fire engines
Then the cannons came

Oh 'neath the brooding sky
Beneath its baleful eye
The cannon shot, the cannon crack
Disturbing night dreams

People fled in droves
To the lakes and to the shores
Left behind a near ghost town
Save the life of the cannons resounding

Still there was no rain

Sleep on endless in your wrecked designs

Forever and eternally, the cliffs around the crashing sea
Unsolved and endless, wait for me

Undulating far below, where lucid waters flow
Their faces seem to know

Where the land falls to an end

The dream swan spins 
And cartwheel turns 
Down deep within your violet side

Wheels spin round and you hear the sound
Of autumn's call at party's fall, autumn's call

Through rose-tinted glass you still remember
The gladness, not sadness, only laughter

In your mind vicious lights rebound
Wheels spin round and you hear the sound
Of autumn's call at party's fall, autumn's call

The smile in the mirror grows weaker
The laughter you heard is growing fainter

Your parties fall around you
The night forgets to rouse you
Your party's fall astounds you
An aura of sadness abounds you

Glad rags sigh, maybe you're alone
Maybe you're alone inside, don't hide
Hurting all the time, hurting deep inside
Don't cry, don't cry

My happiness depends on knowing
This friend is never alone
On your own, a party on our own
We'll have a party on our own, inside
No sighs, don't cry, don't cry

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"Hearing you in my sleep
Feeling you, your cadence seeps
Whispering in flashback
The specters of your memories
Fall in glistening showers

Such a tender descent
Intones this haunting lament

The sweetest chill

Fearing you but calling your name
Icy breath encases my skin
Fingers like a fountain of needles
Shiver along my spine
And rain down so divine

The sweetest chill
The sweetest chill

A drowning so sublime
Spins in a heavenly climb

Calling you, tears thaw my sleep
Wanting you, this hoary web is weaved
From this strange confusion
Grows a perverse communication
It enthralls me and coils me around

The sweetest chill
The sweetest chill
The sweetest chill

Enchantment ebbs and whirls
The sweetest chill
Enchantment ebbs and whirls
The thrill, the sweetest chill

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"This unrest beats out my breath
Disconnected thoughts jangle in a mess

This unrest crucifies my chest
Without anesthetic it cuts
Through tumorous flesh
This unrest beats out my breath

This unrest beats in my chest
Discordant limbs watch unimpressed

At the aimless walk, the mindless talk
The pictures leap out and dance for me
They laugh at me

As your bitterness closes in
You're feeling very old again
Ah, just to sleep, without these thoughts
But the angels shout, resurrecting doubts

Ah, we meet again, my trusty friend
Demanding new favors for old time's sake
Inside this captive frame
Oh, come and claim your liberty

Metal and flesh will fuse today
These visions jump out and blast my days

Clean away, clean away, clean away
Clean away, clean away, clean away
Clean away, clean away, clean away
Clean away, clean away, clean away
Clean away

Dissolve these eyes so I may cry

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"Now me and my partner we work on the run
The quick try to get quicker and the creepers get hung
It's you that got wasted tonight on the job
One lost his liquor, the other lost his hand

Ten sticky thumb prints on the door and the sink
But nothin' saw nothin' just smell the stink
Five hundred mugshots and a hundred to one
Four forgotten and the rest just won't come

When you've begun to think like a gun
The rest of the year has already gone
When you've begun to think like a gun
The days of the year have suddenly gone

Blood on the windows and blood on the walls
Blood on the ceiling and down in the halls
Papers keep pounding and everything that burns
People getting restless but they'll never learn

I picked up a doctor he's good with a knife
Says anesthetic's a waste of his time
Works in a hurry but always worthwhile
Knows they won't be back for a long, long time

Top of the staircase was ready to fall
We were still waiting downstairs in the hall
Well, watch out for big mama, she'll set you on fire
Or go for your neck with the chicken wire

When you've begun to think like a gun
The rest of the year has already gone
When you've begun to think like a gun
The days of the year have suddenly gone

Mother of plenty, mother of none
You've got me cornered I'm still on the run
I don't care nothing about you anyway
Stuck in this hole I'm well on my way

The rest of the year has already gone
When you've begun to think like a gun

My little Johnny Jewel
Oh he's so cool
He had no decision
He's just trying to tell a vision
Well some thought it sad
And others thought it mad
They're just scratching the surface
JJ couldn't be with the other kids
Was he on display?
No, no, not today
And all that guy ever said
He said ""I want my little wing-head""
He'd be half-asleep at night
Over his head the sensation of flight
And he'd wake up dreaming
Dreaming....

And he'd run down to the airport
The rush, the roar
And he'd crouch down behind the fence
With a chest full of lights
And then he'd lose his senses
He'd lose his senses....

Oh my little Johnny Jewel
Oh he's so cool
But if you see him looking lost
You ain't gonna come on so fast
Ah, but you know that he's paid
You know that he's paid the price
All you gotta do for that guy
Is wink your eye

How to go my own separate way
It's a shame to think about yesterday
It's a shame, a shame, a shame, a shame

We've been running 'round in our present state
Hoping help will come from above
But even angels there make the same mistakes
In love, in love, in love, in love

Now that we are lonely
Life seems to get hard
Alone what a word lonely
Alone it makes me cry

Thought-train set in motion
Wheels in and around
Express our emotion
Tracks up, then it cracks down

Hoping help will come from above
But even angels there make the same mistakes
In love, in love, in love, in love

And the fire starter from within
Pokes out from fever blistered grin

A desert maker that's his aim
The benign cremator, branding iron in his hand
Eager and willing to torch the land

All fire and brimstone, this Jack-O-Lantern

His ardor smoulders, phosphorous flies
He radiates with urgency, hypnotize
Stoke the furnace, feed his need, this thirst for fire is all he seeks
He's the blazing rubber making tracks, the blue touch paper at your back

All fire and brimstone, this Salamander King
He basks while all around him burns

Giddy up, burn-up, not fade away

Giddy up, burn-up, stoke it up and turn it up

The hands that strap you to it's back
You turned around and look behind
Their smiling eyes won't help you down

Their tiny hands, their tiny feet
Such little hearts to miss a beat

Grotesque dwarves in mirrored rooms
Pulled and taut a thousand yous
Staring back through stinging tears
Remembering those fun house thrills

The paintbox tunes and wild balloons
Their watchful eyes, you start to swoon

Little sister, now you're gone
Let's just say it's a mercy kill
But little sister, you've left me
Howling at the moon

If you touched my heart
You might be surprised
You'd be paralyzed

If you touched my heart
A truth might lie disguised
You'd be paralyzed

Just once little sister

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"Alone and left to ponder everything
Alone and left to puzzle out all the pain
Such a silly, silly, silly thing
You must catch it and cease it while you can

Accusations flying, colliding, cheek to cheek
Button up your lip and think before you speak
Oh, see him fly into a rage
And see her cry in her tantrum cage
Too blind to halt this stupid game

Silly thing
Silly thing

Now, all that's left is a feeling very grim
Alone and left to think about the stupid thing
Yes, she would fly into a rage
And he would cry in his tantrum cage
A replay of this dumb charade

Silly thing
Silly thing

I misunderstood you, I buried my head in sand
Please accept my feelings of remorse and take my hand
Such a silly thing, can destroy a man
For such a silly thing to come between such friends
Is hard to imagine or believe

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"Softly into your broken veins
Softly into these broken dreams
Will you ever come home?
Will you ever be found?

Standing on shattered windowpane
Softly I whisper your name
Concealed in bedclothes of frosting cold

Softly the snowflakes start to fall
Fleecing the velvet skin
Suspended in frozen time
Icicles slowly drip outside
To the rhythm of your wounds here inside

I entered your dream, I entered your scheme
Softly to swim inside your veins
Softly in rippling cellophane
To float and glide in time
To the rushing in your brain

I wanted your lips, yes, I wanted your kiss
So softly the moment had flown
My body outside yours softly collects the falling snow
And disappears far away so softly

Thro' a dance of dynamite

I dreamt I crossed the seven seas

In this vacuum a vampire reversed

By the crescent disc rising amethyst
How can love remain the same unchanged?

Meet in veins on the stained glass
Like the lifeline in your palm

Now hidden in disguise, cheap wrappings of lies
Keep your hearts alive with a song from inside

Even though we're all alone
We are never on our own when we're singing, singing
Home, home

There's a man who's looking in
And he smiles a toothless grin
Because he's singing, singing

Their hate is clanging, maddening

Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town

Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town
 
We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?
It's the talk of the town
How can you face them?

What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,

How can love like ours be ended?

Sir Charles Thompson,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1980

Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory
Singin' jive

I like to vocalize
There's nothin' swellah

At the mall they bags empty, and the Boss stay flaunting
And I do it, with a straight face

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Sometimes I ask myself, what is life like
What would I be without this rap, without a mic life
Or will I die young, like my partna Mike like
Won't get to see my girl grow, and see what a wife's like
But my life's alright, no I ain't finished yet
I just got started, I ain't ready to end it yet
I'm 24 years old, I ain't even beginned it yet
I just started having money, I ain't got a chance to spend it yet
I want to be a millionaire, but I'm losing my life line
My ticket out this ghetto, is for me to write rhymes
I know I can get this money, if I write rhymes
Opportunity knocked for me, at the right time
Cause I was losing hope, getting sick of this bullshit
Losing my faith, not listening to preachers and bull pits
God pulled my card quick, nope no more pain mayn
Sunshine for now, no more rain mayn

[Slim Thug]
I grew up around a bunch of gang bangers, and caine slangers
Stayed in danger, cause I played with strangers
Was born and raised by gangstas, taught by the hood
Proud of my block, everyday fought for the hood
Stand up kid, ain't too many did what I did
Saw half the shit I saw, or lived like I lived
When my mama went to work, my brother went to work
In the kitchen, pyrex shifting till it hurt
I watched him grind, fascinated by the cash
Patiently waiting, for my time to mash
Never tagged along, see I had my own gang
We had our own ideas, on how to get this change
We did our own thang, small time hustling
Some young niggaz, never asking for nothing
It ain't take us long, to peep what's going on
The broke niggaz was weak, while the rich was strong we got it on

[Lil Mel]
By all means I had to get it, I'm a hustler black
This rap thing what I dreamed, don't want to fuck with crack
But damn, being broke I can't fuck with that
And being po' ain't what I hoped, so I hustled stack
Have nuts have money, that's the code in these streets
And when my money got low, I was holding the heat
I'm just a young nigga living, trying to sip and ball
And even though these streets wet, I can't slip and fall
I ran with killas pull triggas, up out they stacks fo'
And if they broke, they hitting your back do' with the Mackno
Fuck worrying bout haters, cause that'll freeze em up
That's what the heat is for, guaranteed to heat em up
These streets bad and yeah lil' daddy, from has-fect
A young nigga could lose his life, over a glass set
It'll take a cell in a jail, for us to do some mad thinking
That's how it is that's how it go, I know it's sad ain't it

[Chris Ward]
You gotta know, that you can't take your life for granted
Cause it's a loaded game, out here on this lifeless planet
Smoke till my eyes get slanted, just to focus better
Thinking over pass times, when I wrote this letter
I just hope it gets better, for the future's sake
Trying not to make the mistakes, that I use to make
Been out in the streets, since the age of 17
And witnessed all type of bullshit, most have never seen
Damn near homeless, I slept on flo's slept in cars
Been through all kind of battles, nigga just check my scars
My backgrounds my resume, and my repitwa
That's why I walk the way I talk nigga, and wreck this hard
Please God, no more rainy days just sunshine
Cause me and my homies tired, of ducking one times
If I could I promise, I will put this gun down
But how can I, when I'm a soldier on the frontline",It's So,2004

So Sir fucking Daily, is still on top
And your fucking lady, is still on my jock

When we vacate it's Kaynan Islands, and cuban cigars
When we pull up we back to back, in European cars

We entrepreneurs conessuors, slash superstars

It's Killa nigga, but not the one up out the Dip Set
It's the one that hang with that blue gang, like a Crip set
That'll get the clip set, leave you niggaz whips wet
Bust in your chick face, leave that hoe lips wet

It's Slim Thugger motherfucker, tell it like it G-O
Making niggaz get in line, like a fucking P.O
Boyz N Blue, run the H-Town streets
Niggaz better bow down, when you see the badge piece ha

Trunk open top down, swanging 4's showing surround
Make a hater go blind, once he see that blue line

It's some new sheriffs in town, look at the badges on the necklace
You boys best respect it, or it'll get hectic
So I suggest, that you chill with that plex shit
Cause you don't wanna be behind the barrel, when you see the tech spit

Et peut-être que l'Rap certains l'font pour rire
Mais moi j'cautionne pas
Est-ce que quelque part dans ce monde pourri
Des gens pensent comme moi?
J'entends les foules hurler, jamais j'ferai le vendu
J'fous le boucan, je vous l'ai juré
Faites péter du Group Home, jure pas sur ta maman!
Sur la tête de ma mère... J'aimerais mettre une couronne
J'suis qu'un serviteur des notes, pas le plus sérieux des hommes
Un périlleux désordre déforme mes terribles révoltes
Et comme les rimes récoltées, c'est ça qui m'fait vivre
Des phrasés asymétriques, t'en verras pas d'si maîtrisés

Musique, je t'ai pas choisi pour me dégoter d'la thune
Tu m'as soutenu quand la déprime voulait dérober ma plume
Quand un frérot fait la une, c'est un exemple d'amour
Et même en plein jour j'pourrais te décrocher la lune
Musique, t'es incendiaire depuis que je t'ai déclaré ma flamme
On est des gars pas très banals
Qui pourraient dévaster Paname avec des phases
Et je sais que t'étais là quand j'ai squatté l'asphalte
J'ai failli déraper mais j'ai taffé pour ne pas rater ma life

Toi et moi on s'entend bien
J'ai besoin de toi autant que t'as besoin de moi
Quand je rentrais dans l'Rap, c'était pas sans lendemain
Et j'le savais re-fré, et ouais j'taffais le verbe
Surtout pas zapper le thème, en grattant sans fin
T'étais toujours là avant mes embrouilles
J’avançais dans le brouillard, sah, mais jamais dans le doute
J'ai pensé sans le vouloir, qu'tu me mettais tant de coups bas
Quand j'étais dans c'trou noir et que j'partais en couille
Mais c'est fini cette époque, j'fais d'la zik auprès d'mes potes
Moi, j'suis sélectif quand j'déteste des types, moi, j'me téléporte
Moi, j'suis le maître au mic et je baise des miss
Sur tes mélodies, moi, je t'aime très fort

Personne, non personne, ne t'aimera plus que moi
Dois-je encore te le redire, musique, quand voudras-tu me croire?
C'est pour toi que j'suis devenu maître de cérémonie, merde
Faut qu'les jolies fesses bougent sur nos chroniques, mec
L'usine, grâce à toi nous est pas destinée
Shoot dans cette fourmilière, nique tous ces pourris d'traîtres
Oui oui, tu m'as fait quitter l'école
Fuck, le Rap c'est mieux, personne va m'dicter mes codes
Personne!

Personne, No one
Ne pourra t'aimer plus que moi
Can love you more

Personne, No one
Ne pourra t'aimer plus que moi
Can love you more

Personne, No one
Ne pourra t'aimer plus que moi

Quelques jambes dans mon lit, quelques pieds dans mon placard

Ce train de vie m'atteint, chaque jour est un samedi
Cinq heures du matin, nouvelle insomnie
Une partie de poker, du pain sur la planche à billets
Non, strip poker, OK, je ne veux plus voir de blanche habillée
Quand mes gavas font les fous, les voisins font les fous
Mon mot d'excuse dans l'ascenseur

Why do you cry?
Holdin' your head so low
May I ask you why?

And don’t you know that He loves you?
And don’t you know that He cares?
And He will never leave you, no
And never leave you there

‘Cause you are perfect
You are perfectly, perfectly done

And hey, little brother
I know life has been rough
But I believe in you
‘Cause in God, you are tough

You must stand tall
And leave it all
Never let this whole world
Take away your soul

Tääl on liian monta suuta ilman sanottavaa
Eikä se mitä sä sanot vaan miten kauniiksi kaikki puetaan

So if you see me with tricks, you know I just hit a jug
You wanna shine with a nigga, I think you definitely should
Cause when I step on the set, I fuck yo rep in the hood
But I got a rep in Tibet, I pull the Tech on a monk
A real asshole, badboy, I don't play sports
The type of guy make your thighs get a divorce
That's right, anytime of the day you down for the ride
I'm findin' a way, rain, sleet, hail, snow, no job in the way
Look, homie, I stay hustlin' and toll takin'
These bitch niggas, I can't fail them
I can't imagine that type of life you livin'
Ain't no champagne where you sittin'
Ain't a damn thing on yo body fittin'
You watchin' Twilight, nigga
But all the thotties that you ain't gettin'
I don't give a fuck
They shadow clones
They wanna be us
Bussing my cut
Being the blood and guts
You gotta bless the bottle
It seems the only kingdom that we read in bibles
Is closer than we really know

Tongue lashin' suckers, black it like a statistician

Sir Mix-A-Lot,"Here's a gory kind a story about a ole be freak
With a forty-inch waist and a ten-inch beak
Overweight and out a shape with a triple chin
Her brassiere strike fear in the hearts of men

The girl's a Bremelo
The girl's a Bremelo

Me and Terry hoped the ferry we were lookin' suave
When I dip, hit the shift we were almost horse
It was a big Bremelo standin' on my toe
Had an over jelly belly tryin' to say hello
I was really kind a frightened as she looked my way
I tried to run because her buns made the ferry sway
To be blunt she was fat and ready for combat
All the way to Bremerton were the fat is at

The girl's a Bremelo
Let's go

I love bacon over steak and about those big ole ducks
She had hairy underarms and a whopping gut
My hair was short and wavy, drove my pit bull crazy
A Bremerton beast chasin' fellas in the Navy
After movie she's the feature, the Bremerton creature
You wear a life jacket if you ever try to freak her
Look at her physique she ain't my kinda freak
The floor creaks when the beast starts reachin' her peak

The girl's a Bremelo
Just a Bremelo
Change the beat!

You can't ignore the way she snores, cause she blows down doors
Baby's got the kind a face only a mother adores
A big basketball head with a 10-inch beak
Big lips, no hips with the smell of a beast
I couldn't put her in my Caddy or my tranny would break
I heard a dirt because of poverty, but she took my cake
When it comes to cool-Aid the girl would drink it in pints
You go to school for twenty years and your still in the ninth?

You're just a Bremelo
Just a Bremelo

You pink triple-chin unattractive duck
Your boyfriend beats freaks up to make a buck
Hangin' round third and Pike, on a ten-speed bike
You can say that I'm a liar, but you know I'm right
You talk behind my back, because I dropped you flat
And you never take a shower 'cause your too damn fat
So your man was smart when he broke your heart
Because if Mix-A-Lot a cut ya, you a fell apart
Wearin' polyester slacks, with elastic in the back
You could flatten Schwarzenegger in a wrestling match
You got lips like a character in some cartoon
With a pink posterior, you big baboon

Your just a

Now Bremerton's a city right outside of mine
Most girls there are ducks, but a few are fine
But the ones that I speak about
Used their face for catchin' trout
Vacuum clears for a mouth
You know what I'm talkin' about
Mud ducks, hockey pucks, drivers of Mack trucks
Lame brains, diesel trains, pick 'em up you have to strain
Big butt, crew cut, extraordinary gut
Big momma, kinda buff, facial hairs a kinda rough

Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck

Wrapped and sealed by a freak named Shelley (huh huh)

One day I kissed my freak, hit the street
Looking for something to eat
In a 18-wheeler, lookin' real swass
All the girls smile 'cause I'm the big boss
And I gotta eat now, can't eat later
Made a lot of noise to attract my waiter
The boy walked up, and what did he say?
""Say, buttermilk biscuits free today!""
So what you waitin' on boy, get up shake a leg
Gimme 10 of them suckers with grits and eggs
A glass of Koolaid and a whole stick of butter
Them biscuits make me a superfast cutter (huh huh)

Now grab that can and wrap it in your hand
Bang that sucker till it don't expand
Cook them suckers up in your oven
Grab your girlie and get a little lovin'
Add a bag of honey if you want to get funny
Microwave the suckers if you want your honey runny
Kinda get naughty at the Mix-A-Lot party
And rub them suckers all over your body (huh huh)",Buttermilk Biscuits (Keep on Square Dancin'),1988

Body by Nautilus and you ain't even with this
I'm the man, all the homeboys want to dis
Crushin, killin, never beat stealin
But I'm hell when it comes to rhyme dealin
Death to competitors, long live Mix-A-Lot
You understand motherfucker I'ma hard rock
Beat 'em up and pick 'em up and make 'em miss the stick up
But my gat close range, take his wallet, kick him in his cup
Drop the games, cause they really ain't necessary
You can be a water rated, boy you ain't legendary
Sue it far in the Caddy, I'ma chillin
To your girlies I'ma hero, to you suckers I'ma villain
I've done, get me mad I might try
Can't find a better rhyme, if you do you better buy it
Serious and callous could be deadly to competitors
What am I sayin? (your gonna get yours)

Memories of bein broke, keep me on the war path
Hittin like a wreckin ball, Lord it's like a punk blast
Swayed, raid in effect, my posse's with it
Put a fifty on the floor, like a punk you wouldn't get it
Neck snap, head crack, put you on a meat rack
I ain't playin with you boy, you know I mean that
Physical rhymes all meant to intimidate
All niggaz take note, don't imitate
Rippin is the cut, freaks scurry for my T-I-P
Tryna get an autograph from M-I-X-A-L-O-T
Down for the title match and you know what I'm talkin about
Muscle bound, full of things, knock a sucker's lights out
Bring it to my level, boy you better start climbin
When she's grindin, I'm hardcore rhymin
Lyric to your gut and all your lines just buckle
When you make it to the top, I put these boots on your knuckles
Walk into the party like a mob, wearin jet black
""Swass"" skin in effect, sportin coon hat
Walk by sucker punk, look like eat crackers
He mumbled somethin, so my posse walked backwards
Catch 'em on the corner stone and hit 'em with the gat chrome
Let 'em know my posse's gettin bigger, when were back home

Reconnect my dialect with modified jargon
Heavy snaps, never lookin for a bargain
Tumble when the pressure's on, walkin like a movie clips
Slow mo, pants low, jeans layin off my hip
Big shoes, laces loose, a rap warrior

Transform, super fast, nice slice, what a blast
Movin like the speed of light, so quick I shatter plexiglass

You like my tuning cabilities, admit it

All you wannabe gangstas, drivin' Volkswagons
Chillin' at the high schools, broke but braggin'
Under educated, your style is dated
You talk behind my back and your rope's gold-plated
But I'm back to take revenge, my beef will never end
I'll tear your midsection, 'til your body start to bend
Like a pistol, I'm a smokin'
I'm crushin', not jokin'
Whippin' sissies for a past time, and no I'm never chokin'
I blow away suckers with the flicker of my index
Not brass monkey, it's a natural reflex
Go getter tactics, makin' suckers holla
A vicious motherfucker with a rope around my collar
I carry lots a cash, I whip a sucker's ass
I drive a big Caddy, and I pull the trigger fast
Down at Arnold's on the Ave, I fight 'til the death
I let you suck my in my chest, and then I break your damn neck
I got the cold beats rippin', your needle's not skippin'
So many damn weapons that the military's trippin'
People in Seattle hate me, cause I'm not like a hood
But you rock heads wish that you could

Be a hip hop soldier ...
I'm a hip hop soldier

Now let's get one thing straight, my weapons are great
You 22 automatic suckers are late
Got a quarter Moon clip, and a Smith and Wesson
I'm about to give you roody-poos a cold gun lesson
I'm the wizard of mayhem, master of destruction
Got a 44 mag, with the blunt instructions
Page 1 says open, page 2 says feel
Page 3 says cock, page 4 says kill
A mini 14, full combat dress
A thirty round clip, and I ain't takin' no mess
Cause I'm a rough eyegrasser, a camouflage dresser
My M16 has a flasher presser
My Sterling mark six , it's funny but it hits
It looks sideways but the sucker will kick
A pack of dangerous beretta, kinda small but its good
Some of you wannabes wish that you could

Be a hip hop soldier
I'm a hip hop soldier

Now I'm about to get go, so I better clean up
I'm not avigatin' crime, but you gotta get tough
I don't believe in gun control, the theory is proven
Give a criminal a gun, and your public is losin'
For you gotta fight back, cause the pigs ain't black
No protection in your section, now it's time to act
A 22 won't due, you need rapid fire
I'm a ammo gum gun buyer
Big battle rifles, can make a suckers day
You mess around with me so lot, you might get blown away
Wearin' 5 gold rings, never intimidated
In Seattle they are jealous, cause a brother has made it
But they don't mess with me, cause they might get Iked
I'm not a gay rapper, I don't like to get knifed
The devil made me do it, and I wannabe good
Don't you roody-poos wish that you could

Be a hip hop soldier ...
I'm a hip hop soldier ...
I'm a hip hop soldier ...

I'm runnin' hollow point bullets, in my 38
So if you plan to get ill, you better stay in your place
Cause I'm not a game player, I'm just a rhyme sayer
My vigilante group includes my mayor
I pack two uzis cause they stop all crime
You might get yours, but don't let me get mine
I never beat woman, romance is better
If a freak wants to leave, boy you might as well let her
West coast rappers we all bust hard
When we chillin' on the set, we never need a bodyguard

I did nothing but stare
I looked straight in your eyes and I sing, ""Let's do it!""
But you didn't even care, oh girl!

But now we're all alone
And you're looking oh-so-fine
I like to whisper my two things in your ear
And try to blow your mind, baby doll, oh!

Put your head up on my chest
Feel the pounds of my heart
Rest assured once I lay my foundation
We would never fall apart, girl!

These crowds are paths that haunt me at night
Call them romantic dreams
But it's so realistic I toss and I turn
And I wake in a sweaty scream, ah!

A romantic interlude  [x5]

While driving I was thinking, as you slept in my lap
I was thinking of the things we could be doing, baby
Back at my flat, you know what I mean? Oh!
The sun was rising, I had driven all night
And be weary at the wheel

I looked down at you while you were sleeping
Your beauty seems so unreal
You open your eyes and said, ""Mix-a-Lot's hours of sleep
Because you are on my mind
Why don't you search for my hidden treasure
There's no telling what you'd find""

By this time I was tripping, girl
You're such a tease
But it was love, baby, not a one night stand
You're not a sleaze, girl, oh!

A romantic interlude  [x4]

You woke up with a worried look on your face
Something was on your mind
You got out of bed and walked towards the window
And stared through my venetian blinds
You would turn and look at me
As you stood wrapped in lace
I crept up behind you and held you tight
And a tear ran down your face, oh baby!

You said, \""Now you got what you want!
Don't you want to leave?\""
I said before it's love, girl, not a one night stand
You're not a sleaze, ah!

That frown soon turned to a smile!
You realized I was deep
Deep in love in the holistic sample of sophistication
In other words, my freak!

I knew this song's a hard bit too
But the test song's full of grief
Making songs full of heartbreaking regret
It's not my belief, girl
To see your smile is all I want
Your tears I exclude
The next time you see me you crave, whatever!

Hey Mix-A-Lot, what in the world is that noise cotton picker?
Sound like Grand Ole Opry
Hear what I say Mix-A-Lot, say sound like Grand Ole Opry cotton picker
Now before we end this filthy cut, we got a few things we have to say
To the home girls sprung on the hum drum beat, check out Sir Mix-A-Lot Ray
His style is fresh, so clean and new, he pulls so many tricks
If you give him ten bucks and a brand new tape, he'll put you in the mix
A ha ha, hey Mix-A-Lot I caught you that time, cotton picker

My beats are icky",Square Dance Rap,1988

Sir Mix-A-Lot bread the ultimate freak
So cute in a suit, my beats can see
Intelligent freak, wardrobe complete
You can fold my robe, if you be my freak
I got a big Cadillac with the bass in the back
Try to take my freak, boy you must be whack
Bicep's flex, so kiss my neck
Buying pounds of gold with royalty checks
And I'm Swass

Packin' more dollars than chase Manhattan
A, after eaten sure my bill for fatten
Yep, my phone be ringin' like you wish yours would
But my girl stays cool cause she looks so good

All imitators I will spank

Innovative beats with a brand new twist
Don't you wish your man could rock like this
Break it down

Eighty dollar slippers to wash my car
It attracts more freaks than a beach lifeguard
Ah, imitate me and you'll bring about pain
Better wear dark shades when you look at my chain

I work for myself don't have no boss
Boy you gotta have brains if you want to be swass
And I'm swass

(*chanting*)

[Verse 1]
You could strike a match in my hand
Too black to tan, heavy-metal rhythm from a one man band
Bust my knuckles in a junkyard scuffle
Whippin' adversaries with a brass belt buckle
Born in the ghetto, hard like metal
Got a '87 'vette with a fat gas petal
Live a hard life, shave with a knife
Love to get freaky on the gloomiest nights

[Chorus]
I got childhood scars in the streets of my life
Girls laughed, now they beggin' to be Mix-A-Lot's wife
The new breed is here, vigilante's of rap
Got eyes like fire, with my boys at my back
Now I'm back for revenge, all the rumors must end
Freaky breathin' is out, bold music is in
I lot of dummies gettin' money, just by clappin' their hands
Not the style or desire of a true Iron Man

(You know what I want to hear)

[Verse 2]
A southside broola don't drink coolers
Big money maker, not a dumb drug user
It's real not drama, hate pet llamas
Met Clint Eastwood, slapped his momma
Billboard thriller, Avenue chiller
Hard rock lover, and soft rock killer
Girls in the house, watch your blouse
I'm the man your momma was warnin' you about
The bad boy of rap, givin' no slack
Talk behind my back, and you might get slapped
You might get paid, but your metal ain't real
Your rock's like mush, this rock's like steel

[Chorus]

(uh, everybody now, *chanting*)

[Verse 3]
A big ego crushin', MC's fussin'
More lines in my face than a sunburn rushin'
Hardly ever speakin', girl's be tweakin'
Buggin' off the drums, cause the snare be peakin'
World's most hated, too bad to be rated
Makin' you mad and I'm elated
Beats sickapater, your bad I'm greater
Tougher than Schwarzenegger in ""Terminator""
Guitar cord ripper, Perrier sipper
Transform scratchin' and not a needle skipper
Flesh like steel, MC's kneel
Mickey D's Shrimp Salad not part a my meal
Heavy drum hitter, can't stand kidders
Hate boss metal and I'm not a bullshitter
Girlies want to kiss, suckers throw a fist
A lot of rappers try to rap, but it ain't like this

(Peek a boo)
This is the true story about a young lady I know
(Peek a boo)
A walkin' zombie, product of the system
(Peek a boo)
Now she's play a game by her own rules
(Peek a boo)
The peak a boo game

[Verse 1]
Deceptive, her game is in the thick lane
Pick up tips, while you cause some pain
Hundred dollar bills, pot bellies on the prowl
Pick up your shirt to work is fly but foul
A nympho, I don't know but she can dance though
Start the show her system says go
Naked on the stage but lovin' the pay
Peek a boo is the game, the pure never play

[Chorus]
(Peek a boo) The peep show
(Peek a boo)
(Peek a boo)
(Peek a boo)

[Verse 2]
She's seventeen, but claims to be eighteen
Boss on the tip in the back they do the wild thing
Sayin' please won't get this sleaze to skease
Goes this skease only G's for fees
Only works late, downtown 1st and Pike
Yours for the night, if the money's right
She's a stripper, an Avenol sipper
Down with the zipper, cause nobody wants to kiss her
She's the peek a boo pro, yeah you know
Sportin' high heels and swimsuits, dancin' at the strip show
Used to have a real name now they call her Cocoa
Cocoa went loco so they paid to see her solo
Dancin' on the stage, crowd's a rage
They fill up the garter belt to keep the girl paid
It's a trip cause the girl's clockin' dollars with her hips
Like a ape doin' flips for gratuity tips
Such a shame she's lookin' up the deep throat fame
A porno queen with a plastic name
Hot black babes meet chocolate men
That's the peek a boo game and you know the end

[Chorus]
(Peek a boo) - 4X

[Verse 3]
Girls, girls, girls flesh for sale
But you ain't worried cause your pimp puts up the bail
That's the game, table dancin' led to prostitution
Payin' some punk to avoid prosecution
Sleepin' with cops, chasin' jocks
Twenty dollars a knock, now your smokin' the rock
You started out topless, but tricks want the bottom
Then the rock man got 'em
Rolled you, sold you, then the punk told you
Get on the strip, get me paid or I'm a fold you
Your sellin' yourself, but you say your just a stripper
Your mother's at home, alone, but you forget her
Never mind, your contemplatin' a suicide
Trippin' on black tar, trapped and you want to hide
Strippin', but they would get you through college
Girl you know that whacked out game, ain't solid
But you chose it, and you got stuck wit it
Jump on a table for a dollar a minute
Gamble with AIDS when you ramble
But the Mobil's got your mind all scrambled
Bandits, but the song just a canvas
I paint a picture of life, cause some demand this
From here to Japan, freak show for pay
Peek a boo is the game your daughter just might play

[Chorus]
(Peek a boo) - 4X

[Verse 4]
Now your big time, lookin' up to Hoochieoni
Your butt got bigger, your fingernails phony
Dollars for dames it's a game full a sellouts
I know your name, so I'm qualified to yell out
Baby, seventeen wit a child
Strippin' for perverts and drivin' 'em wild
But there's a man in the back, red eyes and a hat
He wants more than a dance, and a sit on the lap
He wants you Cocoa, he's gone crazy
He thinks pain is a pleasure for a lady
Why? Because your dancin' like a bimbo
Touchin' yourself, makin' love to a pencil
He's hot, turned on, wants to beat your brains out
And he'll pay if you let him just plain out
Beat you, like your some kind a pet
And yo wit it Cocoa, did you forget?
There's a killer on the loose, nickname Green River
Creative with the knife and a young girl's liver
Elusive, smooth, never been spotted
Lookin' for a girl with a Jones and you got it
Cash, the root of your sin
Opportunity knocked but you were never in
But now it's over Cocoa, forever you will sleep
it off, it all started when your father took a peek

Laugh if you want, but you might get crushed
Walk through the dangerous Hilltop brush
Bullet-proof, steel-toed, down to kick butt
Roughin' up character who drop weak cuts
One twenty five was the price tag on 'em
Cool brothers buy 'em, even though they don't want 'em
Style is a must, but the style is rough
China Beach boots couldn't crush more stuff
Strap 'em down, lace 'em up, get in the bucket
Reach for the tongue, pull it out, then tuck it
Ten pound boots could destruct all comers

Runnin' over punks like Iranian troops
Trample, crush, hittin' like a dump truck
Jump in my face and a size twelve get stuck
In your butt, 'cause you wanted to box
One-two punch and the GoreTex drops
On your toe, your brother got caught
By GoreTex boots from the GoreTex shop

Tightly knit, my script is legit
I'm force feedin competition, more rebel shit

I did ""Posse on Broadway"" in cruise control
Runnin like a wart, rap's my sport
Of course loss, and then you pick the part
But don't cry and say you wasn't warned
Cause my voice keeps comin like a STORM
Bass should it be let go, heck no
Want to be hard, cause you failed to be techno
Rugged, ripped and rough hittin like ""Thriller"" (boom)
My bass drum is a killer
Packed like a musket, tough to test it
Your arrested (Yo, was he in a trial?), you guessed it
His eyes are big, his crew ran away in the crunch
Then I hit 'em with the ""Batman"" punch

No cute sweatsuits, just sweat and chains
Step off strapped, I let off caps
Ha, Hitchcock couldn't write more wicked raps
Rip the Godfather, then you start that braggin
I never jumped on a James Brown bandwagon
A malla ralla, makin MC's holler
My rope's so big, your girl's callin me a baller
Bad is played, so I choose to use mean
Diabolical mind, the remorse is unseen
Quick to cut on any concert quack
Lip-synchin rhymes off a raggedy tracks
He claims to hate me, swears I can't beat 'em
I drop a new jam, the punks come like I beep 'em
Tried to jack, stepped up and got popped
Cause I'm takin out scum like ""Robocop""
Twistin off rhymes in a lyrical knot

My words so cold they known to freeze up warts
The scope is focused, notice no hocus pocus
Your girl's a square, but she'll tell ya I'm bogus
Saw you on the street, your middle finger was flippin
And your the victim of a drive-by lyrical whippin
Read my song, lyrics are strong
The critics were wrong, I kind to suckers like pong
aggression the lesson, pain is the ultimatum
Reachin and grabbin, hittin like Jack Tatum
They are crushed, turnin suckers to slush
Heavyweight beef for you punks that fuss
Whippin like handball, punishin the face

Goin for mine, and fight time, still down to grind

I stomp all comp, for it's you I romp
My drum's kickin harder than paternity stomps

Trapped in a box called the ghetto we shout

The governments strong but the dope got in
Punish the accused, but the trial was short

Ollie took orders from the number one man
But the crap hit the fan and superiors ran
Democrats tripped, the committee said can em

Verse Three: Sir Mix-a-Lot

Am I a communist? No. But my brain ain't slow
Not long ago, Mix-a-Lot was po'
Never helped out by the ones with clout
I was mad at the world cause I felt left out
Stealin hub caps, stereos, anything to get paid
I realize I'm a modern day slave
Posse downtown, the sight was set
I saw my home boys mother with a buggy and a bag
People walk by, laughin at poverty
I looked in her face and I soon saw me
College educated, but she can't get a job
The american dream once again got robbed

Runnin' like a Rolex, stuck in the hype mode, track after track, keep it real for a fact
I paid my posse unlike you boy, they all roll tough and they all stay strapped
Get up in my face, shake my hand, saw you on the screen and your head got fat
Forgot where your from, but I'll tell ya where you at
Lip synchin', lyin' and about to get slapped
Smoke some of this, suck it up then think
If your group's not paid then you might get backstabbed
You's a brother, but you actin' like another
Who was tryin' to get rich, now he's workin' wit scabs
I'm a genius, brains are the new thing, knowledge is in, and I'm pour somethin' wit it
You attend my dope Seminar, and listen to the lyrics, hit it

Debonair your nightmare, don't stare down when I clear from Greenpuff Square
Dare to squares, break 'em up into pears, yours boys got scared
I bang, bang hardware
Four four shoot 'em up, cock and pop pop
Desert Eagle Magnum and it stops
Waitin' for crime to roll and pick locks
Mauseburg pump blasts, he got dropped
That is the life of a 'Hip Hop Soldier', I'm hated in the hood so I gotta stay strapped
Rollin' in a drop top SEC, cops stop, wanderin' why I'm heavily packed
I'm legally armed and like dynamite I'm ready to blast on punks who play hard

Sir Mix-A-Lot,"Tell y'all what I'm rollin

There's something about my Benzo with tinted windows
It's kinda slick, how I'm made for bimbos
Cruisin down the street with this gip on my hood
I'm gettin points like a Benzo should
I said ""yo skees you lookin for the flesh
You want to ride, better dust off your dress""
I ain't dissin you .. skees
But my Benzo's the ultimate tease
Walk into the Spectrum, some suckers want to kick my rectum
Got up in my face, tellin me I was deaf
I slapped the boy cause he had bad breaf
Looked down had his rope I saw VNLW
What you tryin do, you dumb brother you
Call yourself a baller in a Volkswagen
You better hush homes and squash that braggin

There's something about my Benzo

(Mind if I be broke but)

Shut up Ron, it's the way I gotta do this
You on my tip boy, like Popeye on Brutus
Don't worry home cut I'm still chill
Just kinda twisted off a Benzo peel (ok)
Four door, I likes mine bigger (really)
I stay strapped for them Buffalo niggaz (me too)
(*voice with accent*) ""Get these seats man there good though""
I ain't no pimp but I'm ""Bad to the Bone""
Cellular phone in the middle
So many buttons on my dash, it's a riddle
Rollin up to Ave., I'm chillin
Grill's dirty from the birds I'm killin (Got 'em)
Girls please step back don't touch this
The kinda car jack artist don't mess with
Yes, my rollouts in effect
It's time to go, too many skirts want sex

(That's what I'm sayin)
There's something about my Benzo
(Oh yeah, that's right, sing it Mix, sing it)

Bought it in Miami, rode it to Cali
Hit 150, through the Fernando Valley
AMG down with the big gold grill
Tack jumps when it's time to get ill
15-inch woofers, boom in the trunk
""Posse on Broadway"" for maximum bump
Cruise like Deletho, playin my rhyme
Rewind the tape kid, that's the wrong line
Back to the car, automatic on the floor
Points with the skirts bought a Benzo, scores
Whole gold shot, that includes gold mirrors
The wipers on my lights make the word a bit clearer
Whip, dip, munchin barbeque chips
Honkin at pimps at these flip for the tip
Roll up on baby I said ""aight, a-a aight""
Some old player riffin of big old players day
Baby dropped her vanity workin that makeup
Wavin at her friends, thinkin she's a taker
But I let it slide
You use me for the ride, I use you for the high
You know what's up, that's the way the game rolls
Use me I use you, and so the story goes
Ho pimpin on pimpin, the chant the homies scream
Bring them skirts to the Benzo king

A ha haha, yeah
Just something about my Benzo

Not just one, I got three
I collect 'em you see
SEL, a 190, and a SEC
I ain't no dope man Mr. Lolly jump on TV tryin to diss
Brothers like you hate to see black success when it's legit
But it's real, check the latest Vibe
Sixteen nahs, and the reader make it five
CD, cassette, big amps make it rock
Turn that AC off girl it's a drop top
SEC, hog of hogs
Hit the funky street lights when I'm rollin in the fog
Cruisin at a 100 when I spotted this car
It was a trap .. they call it radar
State Trooper in a 5.0
Will he catch my SEC, now you know
Gunnin 130 on the outskirts of Seattle
Ha, that's the end of that battle

Sir Mix-A-Lot,"Oh, my, God.  Becky, look at her butt
It is so big, she looks like
One of those rap guys' girlfriends.
But, ya know, who understands those rap guys?
They only talk to her, because,
She looks like a total prostitute, 'kay?
I mean, her butt, is just so big
I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there
I mean gross, look
She's just so, black

I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waste
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, want to pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh baby, I want to get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But with that butt you got makes (Me so horny)
Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you want to get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen her dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat, wet,
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back

Now here's my scandal
I want to get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I want to get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I want to fuck
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies (Yeah) Ladies (Yeah)
If you want to role in my Mercedes (Yeah)
Then turn around, stick it out
Even white boys got to shout

To do with my selection

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers want to play that ""hard"" role
And tell you that the butt ain't gol'
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that
'Cause your waste is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down,
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts

Ain't nobody heard my latest
You thought Mix-a-Lot was through
But I'm back; this boot's on you
What happened to all the old homies?
When the money gets funny it's lonely
My ex turned into a slut
Down at the Hollywood, slangin' that butt
Cheap perfume and a mini-skirt
Girl, what's your line of work?
Now that I'm rollin', you want to roll with me
But have you been to the clinic lately?
Yesterday you had six condoms, see
Today you got three
Tossed you out like a paper sack
This brother ain't Sprung On The Cat
What about all the old homies?
I got paid so they call me phony
But I refuse to lay it low,
When a brother like you tells me I can't flow?
So here we go, bro, the leader of the Flow Show
Let you know, I roll and get mo'
I yank the bank and I ain't been ganked
Cause my back you're trying to shank, but no thanks!
My face shows pain and strain as I stand in the rain
With this fame, you go insane
The game I run is not fun to some,
And now I love no one!

Beggin' for a few hun?
Son, your fun meets my gun!
Now you scream you're true black
Boy, you need to chill with that!
Cause I'm an e-qual op-por-tu-ni-ty de-stroyer
My gat's my lawyer
Last week you's a stick-up kid
And this week you're in show biz
Standin' on stage, another black want to-be
want to get paid, so you're as balck as you gotta be
Throw up a peace sign, fakin' the rhymes
Run out of lyrics, scratch in a Malcom X line
Hypocrite, your hits break the bits
The boss of brain lays pain when I spit
Criticized, cause I'm takin' the dares
And now you're tryin' to tell another brother what to wear?
Come off that tip, you know how it goes
Another brother gets shot and punks blame it on gold
Gold ropes?  Naw, that ain't your problem
The job of a rapper is to find em and solve em
Now you're crying bout what a brother owns
King died so you could buy your throne
I ain't got time to take steps in reverse
You or the KKK, who's worse?
You told me to stay low in my ghetto
And so did the Klan, so wake up, bro
Why do you think brothers is sellin' dope, fool?
America, boy, the bankroll rules!
Play that hard role and say you ain't with that
And everything you're cryin' bout money on your contract
Talked about me bad, it's time for the payback, black,
The boss is back!

I don't know the meaning of trust
I gotta live so I do what I must
Some girls'll cross you when you're soft
That's why I'm my own damn boss
They'll run you down with stress
If you're spring on the butt and chest
I'd rather be sprung on the ducat
And put another damn freak in my bucket
I deal with women, not girls
Cause them young ones'll shake your world
I'm tellin' it like it is
Cause a brother like Mix ain't losin' his
I got about two or three clowns
That try to kick me when I'm down
But when I come up, they all play dumb
All of a sudden, it's we, not one
I zip up lips when I spit these hits 
I'm equipped to make misfits quit
Young bucks should all duck cause jaws are gettin' struck
The luck gets chuched, so wussup!
I ram and cram my jams in the mouth of a man
I'm kickin' quicker than Van Damme

Don't you want me?  
You paid for me.  kneel to me.
Smoke me.  breathe me.  inhale 
Ha ha ha ha ha ha, I'm your new god.

She's only sixteen, she looks lost
Bought crack from the dopeman, and got tossed
Livin' on the streets, smoked out
Perfect individual for me to bust out
You can sniff me, or you can puff me
But the girl shoulda known, you can't trust me
She's only ninety eight pounds and lonely
She calls to her god for help, and that's me
Cocaine, go ahead n' use me, heh heh
Momma won't know you're a junkie
Just put me in your pipe, light and suck
Cluck cluck cluck!
And while you're high, grab a twelve gauge
Jump back on the streets, in a crack rage
The only way out is the suicide route
Put the gauge at your dome and take it out
Now I'm on the six o'clock news
All my movies get the rave reviews
60 Minutes had a special on me
The god called crack is killin' your society
Colombia is where I get picked
I can kill with a ninety-ten split
I work through the week, my pleasure is pain
And I'm your new god
You can call me cocaine

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

Heh heh heh
Go ahead n' smoke me

Brothers throwin' up a set to protect me
I'm worth a lot so money so respect me
Doin' damage on the boulevard, just like that 
Shoot 'em over crack
Dope dealers would kill for me
'Cause if ya sell me, I help ya live lovely
You want a Porsche?  move a few ki's 
Just remember that your god is me
The task force bum rushed one of my employees
A big score, twenty three keys
Now ya see another dopeman sink
And one young cop on the brink
The cop's thinkin' bout pinchin'
And alimony checks to his wife for the rent and 
Kids, so the profit is slow
And he wants to make his bankroll grow
Twenty three just sittin in the back seat
I can make the best man weak
So the cop hits the streets to sell a little pain
Now the cop has a god
You can call me cocaine

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Cocaine
Smoke this
Smoke it
Smoke it

The only way I can be stopped is with intelligence
And you don't get it, so that's irrelevant
So you die, or else go to jail
And I'm happy as hell
I tried to get a young kid but he just said no
Because of some sports hero
So I entered the hero's house in the form of a line
And let him snort one time
Now he'd dead, cause my dose was pure
Got him too quick for the cure
So the headlines read, ""dope made another hit""
Dead on the first sniff
Now the kid is lookin' for another hero
I let him know the other fool was a zero
He hits the streets, lookin' for a remedy
They introduce him to me
I don't need another junky, just a flunky
Besides, the little punk was spunky
So I put him in a fresh pair o' Dickies
Give him a beeper, and let him terrorize the city
Put him in a gang, teach him to slang
Another young punk deep in the game
He'll be lucky if he lives til' eighteen
And I'm his new god
You can call me cocaine

Klan, run 'cause revenge is fun! And I'm that one
To make you tap dance with a shotgun
On Donahue they said they had weapons
Just to teach black people one lesson
But I ain't goin' to your school of fools
So come here, and look at my tools!
You can meet and greet the Glock 19 in your nostrils
I'll splatter your dreams
Plans to overthrow are left in limbo
'Cause one loco bro chose to dispose of you
And your skinhead crew
I ain't a house nigga with a twenty-two
I dump a hollow-point slug in your windpipe
Try to breathe believe the hype
'Cause this ain't the jungle fool
And I don't throw spears, and I ain't leavin' here!
A Nazi and you ain't never seen Germany
But you was lookin' for a enemy
So you found a young brother with cash
Crashed my glass, snatched my whole stash
Boy I'ma getcha back, like it ain't no thang
Show you what I learned from the gangs
Stack 'em up deep in a six-nine Deuce
Long range scopes for the whole damn group
Hangin' outside a club called Moonshine
Waitin' for the right time
There he is, walkin' in the Levi's blue cut
The Wicked One dropped two shots in his butt
I can't solve racism with a gat
But this is where my head's at get 'em with a jack back!

""You ask me the niggers around here
been treated awful bad for a long time""

I've been sayin' this, I gotta fix 'em
I want to fix 'em with a crucifixion
Nail 'em to a cross and burn 'em
Burn 'em burn 'em burn 'em!
It's been said that this would happen
Skanless skinheads jackin
All up in the crib insult for takin' my force
I had to break North
The leader had a spraypaint can
And on my wall wrote, 'Death to the black man'
Burned a cross in front of the hideout
Hopin' they could get my race to die out
I'ma 'cause 'em pain, physical and mental
I speak slowly through the temple
The Wicked One is talkin' trouble
Blastin' skulls into pieces of puzzle
Damage 'em so bad, they can't stop me
Not enough body left to get an autopsy
Skinheads, stakin 'em out
Bloodshed, takin' 'em out
Caught one of 'em, Mix said, ""Go ahead""
Thirty-eight, straight to his forehead
I hit 'em hard and it hit the spot
I punish and plot with Mix-a-Lot
Now where's the leader at? Gotta get him back
Gotta get the gat, gotta get the axe
Call it a revengeful murderous pact
Call it the jack back!

""Some things are worth killing for""

They burned a cross in my yard, caught a brother off guard
But I can't cry, 'cause I'm hard!
They jacked another black, but this black wants payback
I rack up killin' stats!
Now I'm on the hunt with a 12-gauge pump
Massive hardware's in my trunk
Creepin' low and slow
There's one roll down the window
What's up, fool?! (""No!"") buck buck buck
It ain't done til the punk stops breathin',
Watch Kunta Kinte get even!
It goes like that when a brother stays strapped
Couldn't get a job so I learned to rap
Livin' kinda large and the skinheads hate me
Run up in my house and they tried to take me
Now I got the metal to his dome
A Desert Eagle, dipped in chrome
I got a black stocking cap yanked over my face
Anger is takin' rationality's place
Hitler's in the house and I'm takin' him out
He shouts but the barrel's in his mouth
Before I shoot, he wants to know if I'm white or black
I yank my mask this has been a jack back!

""These boys were trained activists""

I'm not a slave but the Ku Klux Klan
And the Aryan Nation say I am!
What's behind the skinheads out to getcha?
The reincarnation of Hitler
Now I got a murderous attitude
I'm in a put 'em in a casket mood!
Remember the days of slavery?
They hung many black men from a tree
We fought to be free real hard
And the black man's freedom must not be scarred!
Callin' me an African Sambo
But after this, ""American Psycho""
And I'll smoke any skinhead racist
With the black glock that's in my fist
And the morgue'll be packed in body stacks
Memories due to the jack back
Caught the leader of the skinhead clan
You know the one with the spray paint can
Drilled him with a crowbar die!
In the left ear, out the right eye
Then I took a knife to his chest
Carved a wicked message in a bloody mess
It was a warning for the rest of his pack

He went down to the concrete ground
I'm a hound when I get down
And I'm back, the mack with a lyrical knack
To pack sacks and never pay tax
And when I leave they diss me
Knowin' they can never get with me
But he who laughs last gets the most cash
And lives the blast past of rap trash
Gone!  Left ya, son
Gimme a call when you're done
Your silence is my trade, shut up!
{Your silence is my trade}

2x:
Lockjaw!  (Shut up!) {Your silence is my trade}
Givin' MCs lockjaw! (Shut up!) {Your silence is my trade}

Run, run, run, your time is done, son
Move out for the well-hung young one
And I'm rackin' up stacks of greenbacks -
Dead presidents, black!
Peace to my fans and I love ya
And I got yo' cover
'Cause I'm back to please 
And cool off the hot MCs
'Cause they're runnin' around like ants, tryin' to grab their pants
That shit don't make you dance!
What's this beat doin'?
Leavin' your posse ruined
Stuck my fist in his mouth
Caught him on a whole shout
No pity on the lyrically weak
Face defeat, retreat, but don't speak
'Cause I ain't through, fool
And you ain't true to the Mix rules!
You try to flow so you go for what you know
But yo, bro, you ain't the flow pro
(Ohh!) I can't go slow
Gotta grow 'cause I want to get mo' dough
Full blown, bad to the bone 
And known to get it on with a microphone, homes
Leave my throne alone
I've been to the low zone
Your silence is my trade, shut up!
{Your silence is my trade}

2x:
Lockjaw!  (Shut up!) {Your silence is my trade}
Givin' MCs lockjaw! (Shut up!) {Your silence is my trade}

Come on, Punish!
Punish!


Your host on the coast is known to boast
And roast most that choose to get close
Put 'em in a lyrical knot
My spot: the number one slot
But I gotta have beats 
When I lyrically de-feat the weak that try to compete
Get 'em up, if you want to go head-up
What up?  Do as I instruct, black
'Cause my gat is jack-backed 
And lookin' at your baseball hat
I rolled over that mess you stole
And took control, and then broke the mold!
Now here I stand, boss man
The NorthWest tip is where I am
And I'm runnin' this work like dope
Shippin' it in planes, trains and boats
Up the charts I go
Steppin' on toes and throwin' low bolos
My group is large, and hard
No need for a bodyguard
We flex, rippin' off MCs' necks
Run 'em into Critical's pecs
Your silence is my trade, shut up!

2x:
Lockjaw!  {Your silence is my trade}
Givin' MCs lockjaw!  {Your silence is my trade}

Come on, Punish!
Punish 'em!
Punish!
Punish 'em!

Ain't you tired of that gameless mark smackin' you in your face baby?
Mack Daddy
You better roll with the big mack, the man with the game
Mack Daddy
Gotta big snake, all you gotta do is make it dance, you know what I'm sayin'
Mack Daddy

I'm rollin' to another neighborhood
Me 'n my boyz, up to no good
Chasin' miniskirts 'n the ride is packed
Rollin' to a mall called SeaTac
Cruisin' 'n the cops don't like that
'Round the mall once 'n don't come back
Four-door Rolls with the black exterior
Turbo Bentley, white interior
A Rolls Royce fulla big black men
In the suburbs, messin' with citizens
Walkin' in the mall, looka how I spit
Sloppy dressed brothers make the females blitz
Big long starters, black low tops
Mack daddy hat got me lookin' like Pops
But that's cool, 'cause, I'm mackin' anyway
'N your females my prey
'N I'm callin' out skirts like Chuck D
Sista we missed ya, get wit' me
Comin', runnin, your boyfriends gunnin'
The big boss is so cunnin'
Some of my home boys hate me
They get a microphone, then try to take me
But you ain't slip, sayin' what's up Mix?
Boy I'm hip to your tricks

I'm the Mack Daddy
Mack Daddy
Yeah ain't no reason to bet ya
'Cause I'm the Mack Daddy
Steadily mackin'
Mack Daddy

Kickin' in a buffed up Lamborgini
If your females proper she gots to see me
'Cause I'm the king of the roll outs
Mack Daddy is back still runnin' my mouth
I see a freak on the SeaTac strip
My Lamborgini's brakes get grip
So I pull up on to The Spot
I start frontin', 'cause I want to get jocked
Topped off the gas, whipped out my cash
'N one girls starts to laugh
But I'm still smooth
'N my game is on, so I make my move
Say, you in the white pants
I'm a step close to ya, but I won't dance
'N what you laughin' at
All the girls start pointin' at my hat
'N I'm a giggle wit' 'em, 'cause I just want to get wit' 'em
I don't hit 'em, I just want to stick 'em
So I pull baby girl to the side
She said she likes my car
I said take a ride
So we flipped up the doors on the Contach
But gettin' in a Lamborgini is hard
So I grabbed baby girl by the rear end
I thought she might need help gettin' in
So I clos' the do'
'N now you kno'
Mack Daddy is about to sco'
The girl said, baby you can have me
So I stopped at the tail
'Cause I'm the Mack Daddy

Mack Daddy
All you all gameless marks know
Mack Daddy
I'm the Mack Daddy
Mack Daddy
Yew

I don't smoke no weed, but I like to G
I don't mean O.G., I mean sex baby
'Cause a brother like me don't date
I sling records 'n tapes
The Rhyme Cartel with the Def American
Gettin' brothers sprung like Farrakhan
'N I'm stuffin' my ladies pumps
In the backa my Benz I humps
I'm nasty 'n proud
To hell with cool, I'm G'in' 'em loud
Other people at the hotel gets no rest
'Cause Mixalots bumpin' them headrests
She got booty for days
Other brothers is pullin' up
But she ain't phased
'Cause I laid my game like a concrete slab
She's the kinda skirt a mack gotta have
Rollin', showin' her off
'N some fool tried to call me soft
He's in a one nine seven two skin head caddy
A old superfly mack daddy
So my girl stepped out 'n he tried to mack
But she ain't havin' that
You see your game is weak, G
My girl, I ain't slappin', I'm mackin'

Sir Mix-A-Lot,"""the police, urge people, to keep their guns locked up and unloaded""
""congress today, seems on the verge of approving gun control""

It's, time to fight back cause the new jack black macks
Ain't did shit about that, whack, jackin'
And I'm packin'
'Cause I'm down for the bank I'm stackin'
And in a straight up brawl I'll mall alla y'all
Ya try to crawl for Tylenol and I install
Big fists in your face, the blow is well placed
Spray 'em with mace in case mace is his taste
Throw up the dogs, the competition is fogged
'Cause he was smokin' the yang, iced and drink the 8-ball
Drunk, stumblin', threw him with the lean
I sweep him, then attack the spleen
Play the congas on his backbone
He's funk baritone until I twisted his dome
Creep up on my house and try to roll me up?
And got stuck in the gut with a black, Glock
And he starts to wobble
Self-defense is what I'm claimin', let's squabble
I pick up a pipe to take plenty of quick swipes
One grazed his dome and sliced his eye whites
I don't give a damn bout a stupid ass burglar
It's all circular
The dope dealer sells dope to the dope smoker
The smoker breaks in and tries to choke ya
But I ain't the one to run from ya son
This is my house, and it's fulla guns!
I'm down for mine and my choke is nice and hard
When you jack the boss there ain't no holds barred!

No holds barred
No holds barred
No holds barred

I'm crushin' most hoods like katie-dids(?)
I'm pleadin' guilty for the damage I did
This ain't about random violence
The (?) crept into my house, fuck silence
Now most punks want to run for the stun gun
Fuck a stun gun, I got the big one
Forty-four mag, automatic, chrome
Mercury-tipped bullets, melt the dome
It's the 1990's, and crack is
Talkin' to the criminals, ever so subliminal
Some crackhead wants mix-a-lot dead
A jack move instead, another fool bled
I can't cry cause my tears are nearly froze
My interior's cold, it possess my soul
I'm on the paranoid tip
And each of my socks got a clip!
When my house got robbed, a top notch job
Cops laughed while my mom just sobbed
9-1-1 only works for the rich ones
So I collect guns!
So step right through if you're down for the wrong move
Most crews are moved by my twelve gauge boom!
How can I love when I gotta
Protect my neck from a punk suspect?
Gun control - I ain't wit it
They banned the AK and any fool can still get it
The innocent have been beaten, bruised and scarred
But for this citizen, there ain't no holds barred

""it is an absolute infringement on my second amendment rights""
No holds barred
""when is this attack on gun owners going to end?""
No holds barred
""education, versus restriction""

Hypothetical situation
Gun control starts sweepin' the nation
Now you got a bunch of unarmed innocent victims
Gettin' fucked by the system
Sittin' at home with a butter knife, huh
Any fool could rape your wife
So what's up when the criminals can't be stopped?
The only one with guns are the cops
But it's hard for a brother to trust police
Huh, so the shit don't cease
So I go downtown to buy a hot gun
I hated criminals, and now I'm one
Because I bought a gat to protect my house
The cops want to bust me out?
So it's illegal to protect yourself?
Hell, you either get killed, or you in jail
So when you vote
You better think about what I just wrote
And fuck writin' a note to yo' congressman!
You got the fool hired
Now help get the fool fired
A scary scenario
And I put it in your stereo
So when a fool tries to run up on my car
R.i.p., no holds barred

No holds barred

No holds barred

Sir Mix-A-Lot,"I'm rollin' in a Nine-Oh van. California, that's my plan
Got memories Mixalot left in limbo, first stop Sacremento
Here we go, hit a club called Bentleys
Want a skirt to git wit' me, hit me
There's a girl with a back like a Cadillac
I walked up and got pushed back
Her boyfriend tell her I'm a play-a
Dropped salt on a dope rhyme say-a
My reputation offends this man
Next day hit Williamland Park
Creepin' like a shark
Spot a bad freak and I swoop like a hawk
""What up?"", ""Howya like to roll wit' a champ?""
""Please! All ya'll rappers is tramps""
My reputation is stoppin' my mission
Every freak in Sac is dissin'
Back on the four lane freeway
Next stop, the two-one-three, L.A.
The two-one-three is rough
But the Mixalot game is tough
Spot a young girl and I start that gamin'
Baby girl asks what set am I claimin'
""Just 'cause I rap, I gotta be in gang?""
It ain't a black thang, it's a rap thang
Censorship is sweepin' the nation
Messin' up a rap stars reputation

A rappers reputation, that's what I got

So I'm finished with the two-one-three
I knock, baby, but it's time to leave
Two days on the hard rock, boys is cruisin'
Interstate Ten, straight to Houston
They tell me 'bout the girls in the fifth ward
You know the boys must score
So we hit a fly club called Guchies
Lookin' for the skirts with the largest booties
Girlies in the club wasn't takin' no shorts
Showin' no remorse
For a brother like Mix, lookin' for the smooth
Didn't need a Houston skirt to get with me
But the nights still young
And the hunk ain't done
So we stepped to the van
Attitude's out of it
The next club, The Main Event
We never think about a dress code
Just step up in the club and let the game roll
But as soon as my boy Maharaji pulls up
Some punk starts runnin' up
He said you don't want to be with a rap star
They play you for your money and your car
Well my boy got crushed but the girl stepped off
With a rap stars rep, the girls are lost
""Hey yo, what's up, this is Mix I had to make a run
right quick, but leave your name and number 'n I'll
getcha right back, peace.""

So the posse left Houston Texas
All the girls keep callin' us sexist
Houston media is givin' us rappers no pity
So we all hit Kansas City
In K.C. we go The Gates and Suns
Gotta get grub 'fore we run
Met a little freak named Stacy
I said I'm not just here for the Barbecue baby
She gave me that look, like Pebbles
I'm acked with bass not treble
So I say, Oogley-goo oogley-doo-goo-doo
""What'd you say?"" I ain't tellin' you
You see the Mix game is laced with riddles
It ain't moaney, it's Mix in the middle
In walked my ex named Wendy
She got a fresh Dooney Bag
'Cause she's tired of Fendi
Oooh, could a brother be busted
Because Wendy trusted, Me?
An' ah told a lit'l lie 'n
Said I was a loyal guy
Wendy got mad and she wants to dis me
In Kansas City
Wendy starts to groovin'
Hands on her hips and her hair starts movin'
She said the Mixalot game is phony
Just 'cause I said I'm runnin' girls like ponies
But talkin' that stuff is my occupation
That's how I got this reputation

Sir Mix-A-Lot,"[Mix-A-Lot] Yo Attitude (talk to me)
[Mix-A-Lot] We got some bustin ass marks out here
[Mix-A-Lot] Claimin some motherfuckin place they ain't never seen
 [Attitude] Huh, sellout
[Mix-A-Lot] Boy this is the S-E-A-T-O-W-N, clown
 [Attitude] Forever (Seatown)
 [Attitude] Yeah, and that's from the motherfuckin heart
 [Attitude] So if you ain't down witcha hometown, STEP OFF PUNK
 [Attitude] Mix, tell these fakes what the deal is

[Verse One: Sir Mix-A-Lot]
I was raised in the S-E-A-double T-L-E
Seattle, born in the C.D. nigga
19th and yes LeBorda(?) pimpin was hard
Caddillac was the car I wanted
And I got that seven-seven Coupe with the trues and straps
I couldn't roll no hubcaps, huh, it wasn't easy
Tryin to compete, with my homies in the C.D.
Here's my plan, funky-ass sedan
Laid down with the vogues, money in my hand
Hair all whipped up
Carload full of freaks with the butts
I used to cruise around Seward Park
Flip the funky eighty-one, and La Vista
Lookin for freaks to be G'd
Most mini-skirts wanted please
In them days boy you had to be pimpin
Just to keep motherfuckers from trippin
Now punks want to run up pokin
With a nine double-M, is you jokin?
Cause I'm packin - a HK-91 son
308's is what I run
A lot of clowns tried to take this town but they didn't
Huh, cause Seattle wasn't bullshittin

[Interlude: Attitude]
It ain't nothin but the real up in the Northwest (real deal nigga)
So don't step to the 2-oh-6 tryin to kick up dust
Or you might get floored, sucka (get FUCKED UP), think about it
This is from the Attitude Adjustor

[Verse Two: Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Do we got gangs?  Hell yeah, brothers gotta get paid
Mickey D's ain't payin no way
So they take to the streets with gats
And they'll put 'em on ya just like that
So I'm undercover, when I'm rollin through the C.D.
A lot of niggaz want to get me
I see a freak in front of Garfield, I swoop around the block
Gang of niggaz yellin out, ""Fuck Mix-A-Lot!""
Do I hate 'em?  Naw, I gotta love 'em
They think my head is big, and I'm tryin to be above 'em
Huh, but to the masses I'm just another coon
Gettin paid for a little bit of boon
So even though a lot of niggaz talk shit
I'm still down for the Northwest when I hit
the stage, anywhere U.S.A.
I give Seattle and Tacoma much play
So here's a shot to the Criminal Nation
And the young brother Kid Sensation
I can't forget Maharaji and the Attitude Adjustor
And the hardcore brothers to the West of Seattle
Yeah, Westside
High Pointe, dippin fo'-do' rides
And my homeboy Critical Mass in the back
With the bat to smack back all packs who try to jack me
Just because I'm in a S-E-see
Droptop A-M-G
The cops say Mix-A-Lot's a dope dealer
But I'm more like a dope deal sealer
I sell rap deals, not drug deals
Handin out contracts like meals
The Rhyme Cartel, I own the motherfuckin label
And Ricardo got the papers on the table
And I'm signin 'em, just like that
No sluts so my pockets stay fat
A lot of clowns tried to take this town but they didn't
Huh, cause Seattle wasn't bullshittin

 [Attitude] Huh, nigga this is MY town, what you talkin
[Mix-A-Lot] Punks tryin to tell me where I come from
[Mix-A-Lot] Who the fuck you talkin to, clown?
 [Attitude] Need to shut the hell up, Seattle Tacoma strong
[Mix-A-Lot] Shit, you was a young lil' rudy poot motherfucker
[Mix-A-Lot] 'fore you picked up a nine millimete
 [Attitude] Who you smokin?
[Mix-A-Lot] Punk-ass, cake, faggot ass nigga!

[Verse Three: Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Let's take a trip to the South end, we go West
Hit Reinert Ave and bust left
I'm in a funky-ass Porsche Gambala
No bitches, just women on my collar
S-E-A-T-O-W-N
Yo' nigga is back again
Huh, who you callin sellout fool?
I was puttin caps in clowns when you was still in school
But I choose not to talk about that
So many gangsta crews now, I'd rather kick back
So I drop my own style
Fuck bitin somebody else, and jumpin on a pile
But that's another subject, gettin back to the hood
Me and my boys is up to no good
A big line of cars, rollin DEEP through the South end
Made a left on Henderson
Clowns talkin shit in the Southshore parkin lot
Critical Mass is beggin to box
But we keep on goin because down the streets
A bunch of freaks in front of Reinert Beach, was lookin at US
They missed that bus, and they figured that they could trust us
Six cars in a line and the girls was fine
I had ""The Wicked One"" playin on my Alpine
Two Porsches, two Benzes, a Ferrari Testarossa
And a Rolls Royce roaster
Miami Vice tried to get with this, but they didn't

But them drinks ain't cheap out there son
Five dollars for one of them daiquiris
And Dave was treatin'

But at the swap meet that ain't jack
But she bought it, cost about three hun
Mary Pong said you're the one
But when the girls Louie got wet she started complainin'
Baby girls Louie started fadin'
Now she's tryin' to take it back
But the swap meet don't play that
'Cause when a customer tries to intimidate
Mary Pong pulls a point three eight
She ain't about to get bum rushed
She's strapped an' she's ready to bust
But at the swap meet you don't pay tax
They're movin' out fake Louie by the batch

Swap Meet Louie, clockin' lotsa dolla's
Swap Meet Louie, we all got gold
Swap Meet Louie, black silk jackets
Swap Meet Louie, rich flaunt clout
Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie
Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie

Me an' Attitude Adjuster stepped smooth at a swap meet
Buyin' much gear for the feet
When we spot Mary Pong with a blank face
Sellin' bootleg Mixalot tapes
The brother bought the tape and kept steppin'
Mary Pong starts lookin' for a weapon
I got a plan 'n' I'm about to use it
What's up with the bootleg music?
Mary Pong is about to get jacked
She had a stack of big bootleg racks
Me and Attitude creeped like snakes
Grabbed the tapes and the Louie and break
The whole swap meet went crazy
I'm sockin' more fools than Patrick Swayze
Toss a mess of fake Louie in the trunk
Hit the gas and the tach just sunk
Like that, I'm outta there
Swift brothers like to roll in pairs
So we jet, to the boulevard fast
Slingin' swap meet Louie for cash

Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie
That's right, tell em homeys

Won't stop the jock in some American car use a lyrical radar

Lost on the boss, it's finish is flawless

It accelerates smooth
Move or else get move
Run for cover my brother, suckers are getting smothered

My rep is kept, muthafukas must step
The best get swept and let out to rest
Huuuu, look at that air intake

Revolution per lyric get higher
How can I chill when my rhyme's on fire

Sir Mix-A-Lot,"My hooptie rollin', tailpipe draggin'
Heat don't work an' my girl keeps naggin'
Six-nine Buick, deuce keeps rollin'
One hubcap 'cause three got stolen
Bumper shook loose, chrome keeps scrapin'
Mis-matched tires, and my white walls flakin'
Hit mickey-d's, Maharaji starts to bug
He ate a quarter-pounder, threw the pickles on my rug
Runnin', movin' tabs expired
Girlies tryin' to dis 'n say my car looks tired
Hit my brakes, out slid skittles
Tinted back window with a bubble in the middle
Who's car is it? Posse won't say
We all play it off when you look our way
Rollin' four deep, tires smoke up the block
Gotta roll this bucket, 'cause my Benz is in the shop

My hooptie - my hooptie

Four door nightmare, trunk locks' stuck
Big dice on the mirror, grill like a truck
Lifters tickin', accelerator's stickin'
Somethin' on my left front wheel keeps clickin'
Picked up the girlies, now we're eight deep

Cars barely movin', but now we got heat
Made a left turn as I watched in fright
My ex-girlfriend shot out my headlight
She was standin', in the road, so I smashed her toes
Mashed my pedal, boom, down she goes
Law ain't lyin', long hairs flyin'
We flipped the skeez off, dumb girl starts cryin'
Baby called the cops, now I'm gettin' nervous
The cops see a beeper and the suckers might serve us
Hit a side street and what did we find?
Some young punk, droppin' me a flip off sign
Put the deuce in reverse, and started to curse
Another sucker on the south side about to get hurt
Homey got scared, so I got on
Yeah my group got paid, but my groups still strong
Posse moved north, headin for the CD
Ridin' real fast so the cops don't see me
Mis-matched tires got my boys uptight
Two Vogues on the left, Uniroyal on the right
Hooptie bouncin', runnin' on leaded
This is what I sport when you call me big-headed
I pot-hole crusher, red light rusher
Musher of a brother 'cause I'm plowin' over suckers

In a hooptie

It's a three-ton monster, econo-box stomper
Snatch your girly, if you don't I'll romp 'er
Dinosaur rush, lookin' like Shaft
Some get bold, but some get smashed
Cops say the car smokes, but I won't listen
It's a six-nine deuce, so the hell with emissions
Rollin' in Tacoma, I could get burned
(Sound of automatic gunfire) Betta make a you-turn
Spotted this freak with immense posterior
Tryin' to roll smooth through the Hilltop area
Brother start lettin' off, kickin' that racket
Thinkin' I'm a rock star, slingin' them packets
I ain't wit' dat, so I smooth eject
Hit I-5 with the dope cassette
Playin' that tough crew hardcore dope
The tape deck broke
Damn what's next, brothers in Goretex
Tryin' to find a spot where we could hunt for sex
Found a little club called the N-see-O
Military, competition. You know.
I ain't really fazed, 'cause I pop much game
Rolled up tough, 'cause I got much fame
""How ya doin' baby, my name is Mixalot""
""Mixalot got a Benz boy, quit smokin' that rock""
Ooooh, I got dissed. But it ain't no thing
Runnin' that game with the home made slang
Baby got ished, Bremelo gip.
Keep laughin' at the car and you might get clipped

By a hooptie

Runnin' outta gas, stuck in traffic
Far left lane, throwin' up much static
Input, output, carbeurator fulla soot
""Whatcha want me to do Mix?""
Push freak, push
Sputter, sputter rollin' over gutters
Cars dip low with hard core brothers
Tank on E, pulled into Arco
Cops on tip for Columbian cargo
We fit a stereotype, that's what he said
Big long car, four big black heads
Cops keep jockin', grabbin' like 'gators
'Bout stereotypes, I'm lookin' nuthin' like Noriega
Cop took my wallet, looked at my license
His partner said ""Damn, they all look like Tyson""
Yes, I'm legit, so they gotta let me go

Me and Kid Sensation at home away from home
In the black benz limo with tha cellular phone
I'm callin up my posse its time to get rippin
I'm freakin each sunroof to keep you suckas trippin
Everybody's lookin if ya jealous turn around
The AMG kip keeps us closa to the ground
We're gettin good grip from the 50 series tires
The Alpine's bumpin but I need the volume higher
'Cause the 808 kick drum makes the girlies get dumb
We're rollin Rainier and the jealous want to get some 
Every time we do this sucka mc's want to battle
I'm the man they love to hate the J.R. Ewing of Seattle
Picked up the posse on 23rd and Jackson
Headin for the strip yes were lookin for some action
The limos kinda crowded the whole car was leanin back
Maharaji's watchin tv with two girlies on his lap
On Martin Luther King the set looks kinda dead
We need a new street so posse move ahead
We all look kinda swass the crew you can't forget
The mix a lot posse cold rippin up the set

Ahhhh rollin in my posse was getin kinda bored
There's not anotha posse with more points scored
We don't walk around like criminals or flex like big gorillas
My homeboy Kid Sensation is a teenage lady killa
Maharaji's on the def side dancin like a freak
The girlies see his booty and their knees get weak
Larry is the white guy people think he's funny

I'll be askin' the questions Leroy.
My name ain't Leroy, man.
Heh, all right Jerome, outta the car.
Man, why I gotta be Jerome man? Why can't I be Tommy or Philbert or something?
Just put your hands on the hood Muhammed

It's the man that you love to hate
Coming outta Washington state
Cops don't like my profile
'Cause Mixalot kicks much style
So the man is on my trail
He want to take Mix to jail
If he does, I'll make the bail
'Cause I know a lot of rich females
I'm shakin' 'em just like this
Keepin' that Porsche in fifth
King County cops don't quit
Even when a young brothers legit
So they follow me wherever I go
I hear 'em on the radio
With a scanner that I bought from the sto'
'Cause a brother like Mix gotta know
I'm checkin' them cops with radar
They don't believe I'm a rap star
That my brain is up to par
An I'm ready when they follow my car
I know they want to spray me with mace
'Cause my trunk keeps pumpin' much bass
But they best get outta my face
'Cause one-times got no case, give it to me

One-times got no case

The police think I'm movin' them keys
They trip cause I clock much D
They pull a gat an' they yell out ""Freeze!""
I'm whippin' out my I.D.
My gat sits under my seat
The cops throw me out in the street
They found my gun like thieves
Officer Friendly has got a new beat
So I show him my gun permit
I told him I roll legit
Give me a test to see if I'm drinkin'
They claim my breath was stinkin'
They had me walk on the line
I walked backwards stopped on a dime
My female just reclines
'Cause she knows I know the time
I'm hip to the cop procedure
They get ya every time they see ya
They stop ya, they cuff ya
They roll ya an' they rough ya
They ask what I do for a livin'
Should this information be givin'?
This is what keeps me driven
Some cops want a brother in prison
So I got me a few attorneys
Just in case a cop want to burn me
They protect me from the state
'Cause one-time's got no case, break it on down

One-times got no case

A cop asks me ""What's my name, and don't lie""
And I'm askin' officer ""Why?
Why ya want to mess with a brother like Mix
When you know I'm livin' legit?""
The cop said ""Don't get smart.
I tear soul-brother apart""
I said ""Well take off your gun, if you want to get done
An' I'll show you that I ain't the one""
The cop rolled up his fist
Puts the handcuffs on my wrists
Then he threw a straight jab and he missed
A female cop pulls up and she's pissed
But this cop had K-9
A soul sister, yes she's fine
I said ""Won't ya help a brother outta bind?""
But that badge was going to her mind
So she stuck a billy club in my back
She said ""Don't think because you're black
That I won't beat you"", crack, ""hit you with the gat""
Her partner starts to laugh

Oooh, hit 'em again. Hit 'em again.

So they took me on down to the jail
P.L.B. came to pay my bail
Then we called Goldstein and Claire
Them's my lawyers
Walkin' up the stairs
To the courtroom dressed in suits
'Bout to give a couple cops the boot
So the female cop takes the stand
Took her oath with the wrong damn hand
My lawyers ate her up like catfish
The other cop pleads the fifth
She lost her job

Uncle Sam might think I just dissed him
But nah I'm just pumpin straight facts
You either be a mack, or you get macked

But this HK's keepin em tossed
Cause I duck them deuce deuce treys at point blank range

I'm about making these dividends
and every motherfucker ain't my friend

And niggaz that snatch get slapped
Girls want to roll, that's cool
but I'm not to be played that fool
Some niggaz think a brother with money is slippin
but I've be down, so quit trippin

I hold, and bring up the brothers whose down
to roll, and keep all the shit under my control

Sir Mix-A-Lot,"The Mack Daddy, rippin up skirts in the back of Caddies
If +Baby Got Back+ then baby can have me
Controversy made them ban me, understand me
Girls, bringin many problems to my world
Tryin to make Mix pay for them pearls
One had a baby and it's a girl *baby giggling*
I swore I had protection, got an erection
Must resist temptation
Girls flock, ride my jock
'Cause a big fat Porsche went around the block (mmm)
Met a young girl named Angel
She had a big long weave I'd love to mangle
So I'm puttin in work, lovin tight skirts
So you know a mack poppa gotta flirt (woo!)
Room triple deuced me and baby got loose
Look at baby wiggle that big caboose
Got a little tiny waist, everything's in place
I'm pacin, facin the situation
It's on, put it on tape, troop
Got a little sex now I'm sittin on a lawsuit
Nine months later, little baby pops out
Blonde hair, blue eyes, with her feets in her mouth
Well that can't be me (nope)
'Cause I'm a nappy haired black man, dressed like a O.G.
Angel's gold diggin, this girl's driven
Tryin to catch Mix on slippin
Just because I get paid don't mean I get played
For the bank I've made
And after the blood test I got proof
Your baby is cute ... but don't call me Da Da!

The next story, met a young skirt, said her name was Laurie
Smoked much dank, but her life was boring
Got with Mix, now she adores me
Nasty nigga named Mix (yep)
On a tour bus with the porno flicks (mm)
Anxious 'cause I want to knock boots
And I don't sleep with the girls in my group
So Mack Daddy is strollin and patrollin
Big fat bank I'm holdin
Bus pulls up to the mini mart
And that's where Laurie works and my game starts
Laurie knows nothin bout rap though
And that peeled my superstar cap, so
I'll just go back to the basics
And even that game is stiff, baby, face it
So now Laurie and me is headed to the ?monkey dope?
Straight gettin to the ?monkey poke?
Dip dip dip, one two three
*she moans* 'Cause I'm a vet'ran, see
I kissed her cheek while Laurie was asleep
Let one more groupie use me (mm)
One year later she's tryin to creep
ON MY MONEY
But I ain't the one to get played the sap (uh-uh)
When I hit the sack, big Richard is capped
Your man's a punk for leavin kids with you
The baby's cute, but don't call me Da Da!


 

Don't call me Da Da!
 



I'm sittin, in Long Beach Cali, eatin Popeyes' chicken
Thinkin bout the next snake charmer I'm hittin
Met a fly skirt, nickname was Kitten
And I start spittin,
WhassUP with the brother in the passenger seat?
Homeboy bailed 'cause his game was weak
And he was callin her bitch, I was callin her baby
He got the finger, I got the lady
Me and Kitten left the place quickened (yep)
Busta, you and cousin Kitten need a stickin
TO THE 'TEL, TO THE 'TEL, TO THE 'TEL WE RUSH

I start sweatin, conscience bettin
That I'ma have to deal with bed wettin
But I'ma handle this thing like a man
Settle down and bring the kid up, that's the plan
Three weeks later I get this call though
Kitten sounds happy on the telephone
She said ""Go on and live your life, bro,
'Cause EPT said no,"" so don't call me Da Da!

Early in the morn', it's cold and her knees hurt
She got a .38 sittin in her purse
Cause my moms was the King County Jail nurse
So how in the hell could you tell Mix
That I never lived this, when you was just a snotty nose age six
Young buck, just graduate
And your lyin when you say your street educated
Cause I'ma veteran boy and you's a new booty
So stop frontin to your friends like you knew me
Cause you don't and you never did, kid
So FUCK your respect and the shit you claim ya did
To all ya real, when ya claimin ya gang bang
Doin everythin to gain fame and get yourself a name
But I done seen my homies gettin smoked over dice games
When you was still at home doin nice things
Back in the days of turtle wax on Cadillacs
Life to a brother was hoes and macks
I had to come up some way
Pimp daddies and ex-Black Panthers used to school me
Why moms was puttin in eight to twelve
I was in the hood gettin schooled on makin mail
I can't let my moms die a poor black sister
Gotta make her richer
So tell me what's real, partner

[Break - Sir Mix-A-Lot]
(Da-da-da-down for mine)
(You gon' buy me a motherfuckin car?)
So what's real fool?
(Da-da-da-down for mine)
(You gon' buy me a motherfuckin car?)

[Verse 2 - Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Back when MLK Way was Empire Way
I was stuck on broke, but I used to hear pimps say
Better get what you can get before you get got
Come up and snatch yours and buy yourself a nice spot
And that's stuck in my head 'til this day G
So I apply pimp game to life you see
But I ain't beatin on my sister in the streets
I'ma focus on my real enemy, yeah
So if I'm pimpin, then who's my hoeys
In D.C. livin in a big white house bro
Changes his name every four years
Mr. Carter caught me slippin, but Reagan wasn't gettin his
I never wanted a hand out young Jake
I never got jealous over how much a brother makes
So I was on my own, no love in the school zone
No blacks in the books, so I'm gone
And now the only color that I love is green see
Cause my history books never taught me about me
I may not like where I've been, but I'm lovin where I am
Prime rib, fuck Spam
So tell me what's real partner

[Break - Sir Mix-A-Lot]
(I fought back, then heat check)
(You gon' buy me a motherfuckin car?)
So what's real fool
(I fought back, then heat check)
(You gon' buy me a motherfuckin car?)

[Interlude - Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Yeah, I'd much rather be behind the mic, then the gat
But the simple fact that my pockets is fat
Means I can't relax, you know what I'm sayin?
Haha

[Verse 3 - Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Criticized by the main stream
For not bein the house jig and keepin things squeaky clean
But I can't, so I ain't
But I won't play the hard role just because you think
that is real, to say you kill, when you never held steel
You try to sing when you rollin in cake-ville
Back in the days you was breakdancin see
I remember when you had tight pants G
So Mr. Rap Critic when you trys to check me
about my cars and my girls, claimin you never could respect me
You really think I give a damn partner?
The shit I've been through man
I used to roll with the hoes
Hit the Caddy, slam the doors
Livin alone, cellular phone
Havin no furniture in my home
Rollin to Canada, makin my mail
Givin a trick a piece of tail
Livin it large, keepin it hard
Life was kinda odd
And rat a tat tat with my gat, sat in my lap G
The Hilton Hotel was my spot, I'm runnin my things see
I went from hustlin cheese, to double platinum LPs
But you still can't feel me
Boy the head don't get fat if you know where your at
Instead of ridin my back, check your own dat and that's facts
Now what's real partner

[Outro - Sir Mix-A-Lot - talking]
Haha, so what's real?
Yeah and all you clown runnin around town
Tellin people me and yous was down
When I was doin parties at the Boy's Club
You was sellin match books of weed, partner
I was about handlin my business
And you was about smokin your gri-nass
So check yourself, you want to see the big head champ
And that's real to the fullest and I'm out",What's Real,1994

Want to be hard, false face nigga
shaky ass finger on the deuce deuce trigger (Ainsta)
Think about your pimping square

want to be down, now you want to claim Sea-Town (Aintsta)

Not if you is an undercover busta

[Verse 1: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
What about this motherfucking aintsta
Wannabe gangsta
Sittin' in the mirror throwin' sets at your self like a pranksta
Lil' punk-ass mark
Playing hardcore but you gots no heart
Nigga never had a set of these
Worshiping G's
How can you be down ?
Nigga please
You want to play hard for your hood
Tell them how you whooped Mix-a-Lot's ass good
But what your homeboys don't know
I'ma let them know
If you ever want to squabble
I'ma crack your skull, bro
'Cause you need your narrow ass kicked
You little buster ass snitch
And I'ma say it once and never say it no more
You ain't hard 'cause you once sold-- dope
'Cause you was slangin' like a straight up bitch
Rolled over on your whole damn click
And you can't spell dirt
Let alone do none
Paid your homies, but your Mom is broke son
Now tell me who is a sell-out
I'ma read your ass on the spell out PUNK!

You is a motherfucking Ainsta.

[Verse 2: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
First you want to sound like Ice Cube
Jumping on stage with a mic trying to mean mug fools
Now you want to be like Snoop
But you can't
Cause you fake with your shit, Nigga you and your crew
Bitch Motherfucker out of Woodinville
Faking just to get a little record deal
Used to try to rap like Chuck D
Ain't had a soul sister since I known you G
Huh
And that's real
Now ask your homeboys how they feel
And they will tell your ass the real
Scoop up your cats
With your fake gangsta ass
You could fool them for a minute
But that shit won't last
You sound kind of hard on your demo
But If your Mom and Dad heard it, they would beat your ass though
Cause you is a bitch made gangsta sap
Tellin' all these stories about your see through gat
Ever since I known you
you had one gat
But like a cluck motherfucker you sold that
Yeah
You wanted me to come real
Huh
Now you got your cat peeled beeaatch
And don't start frontin' bout your pimp game youngster
You fuck your own hoes like a trick ass busta
Learn the game brfore you claim it son
Study Hustlers 101
You's a motherfuckin Ainsta

(chorus:)

[Verse 3: Sir Mix-A-Lot]
What you did on the grind don't impress me
Four years of slanging and your pockets is still empty
And you say yu got street game
Need to buffalo your money like a baller man
But bitch made niggas get no love
I done seen your pictures with your fake ass mean mug
Kind of lookin' like a sweet thang
An old pretty motherfucker with a swap meet ring
Khakis nice and fit
looking like your punk ass at the Chevron bitch
Got your gut all bunched up
Shirt tucked in'
A forty in your hand with a stupid ass grin
Fake like a motherfucker
Swearing you is a player when your girl is with another sucker
But you won't cut her loose, cause you can't shake her
You is a motherfucking Ainsta

You'd see that I puts in work, and puts hurt

But you'se in love with a fantasy, trick
You want to 'sit on yo ass, collect checks and shit'
You was younger than me, so I schooled ya
Gave you the tools to come up and get down like a ruler
Took you to executive brunches, high-powered lunches
Gave you dough in bunches

I get around cause I got a tight thing up in Sea-Town
5'9"" with dimples
Caramel skin, straight fine, hella tight, no pimples
Thinkin my game was concrete
But I gotta watch for them other entertainers and athletes
Especially the ones who want to settle down
Cause they'll beg and drink out your shoes and get they nose brown
Just the kinda man you wanted, ain't it, honey?
A big buff dumb-ass fool with hella money
Down to spend till his knees bend
Then the athlete's broke and his girl's in the wind
And my girl gets mad, cause I never spend time like I'm s'posed to
Plus I'm a boaster
Shaggin up too damn quick, now she's lookin for a sugar daddy
Just to get a '96 Caddy
A big truck she found
You young scrub on the bench for the Cleveland Browns
He never had nothin, thicker than a cheerleader
Now he got juice, so he eats her
And treats her to a big wad of cash
Too weak, so she left his ass
You can have her

(You can have her)

Just rollin by the Playboy Mansion...

I got me a, I got me a, I got me a, I got me a 
Young bunny, young bunny in La-La Land
want to get freaky with the papa man
I smack her to the front, I smack her to the back
I smack it with the whiffle ball bat, remember that?
One happy black man I be
When my L.A. bunny want to trip with me
Her name is Teresa
She was freakier than me, but I figured I could please her
She had the long braids
Chocolate sister, loved to cuff men like slaves
Arrived at the house at last
Seen two shades of lipstick on the same wine glass
Provocative artwork around me
Four pink slippers on the floor surround me
One pair's for her, the other pair's for who?
Plus she only lives in a one bedroom
Well hm - it might be on
Ménage-à-trois, open la bouche, taste la bomb
Teresa's roommate walks in
6 ft 2 with a wig and a stupid-ass grin
(Oh my goodness!)

You done brought a big-ass man up in the room?
Girl, what's wrong with you?
Honey, that is gay
Yo partner, you can have her

Puttin holes in my old clothes, even stole my pose
Got my sky, fly, who that guy?
Slip 'em my third eye, falsified
Don't lie, break with a girl, you cry
If you wants game, slip me some change
But you must refrain, from saltin my name
Now your girl's at my door, I told ya bro
Salt me, I take what's yours, that's the rules though

I'm rough as a cactus
Now I gotta change what I practice
So I went to the suburbs and bought me a big house
And now they want to run a brother out?
I'm a well-educated young maker of revenue
Rollin' in a big black BMW
So I'm supposed to fit because I'm straight legit
But the police still want to trip
They accuse me of robbin' myself
Never seen a brother with wealth
Hell, I thought I was big, and now I'm trapped in the house
'Cause the cops got my crib staked out
The police chief is runnin' for commissioner
But if I get outta this, chief, I'm gettin' ya
Chief needs a cover-up plan 'cause he heard I'm famous
Called a crazy white boy, name was Amos
I thought Amos was a burglar
But when he saw me, he said I never heard of ya
He couldn't tell north from south
But Amos was my only way out
Of this suburbian nightmare

Huh 
Yeah
My suburbian nightmare

I may not look like Beaver, but you don't either
I bought a big house for the breather
Even in the suburbs, cops are my enemy
And all the rich liberals ain't friendly
So Amos got a shotgun and I got a skillet
Anything movin', I'ma straight up kill it
I'm a black man on the come-up, I got done up
And roughed up by a cop tryin' to get hooked up
I got a meal and I just sealed two more deals
And now I'm runnin' from the cops? This ain't real!
You see, the cops sent Amos in to play that role,
Be a burglar and rob my home?
They offered him a deal and then took it back
Ol' Amos should have signed them a contract
Chief walks in talkin' that +nigga+ smack
""Oof!"" ""nigga, take that!""

The craziest case that a brother ever heard of
The neighborhood fears me, they're scared to get near me
The cops want to smear me

I used to eat pig feet, now I'm eatin' lobster
Gettin' my check, boy, the hell with them propers
Life still ain't changed 'cause I gotta get my hustle on
Just to get these cops gone
Four or five mil' can't make my race change
It can make the pace change, but it won't maintain
I can't go outside to jog
'Cause my next-door neighbor got a prejudiced dog
But it's America, home of the free
Life in the 'burbs ain't nothin' like TV
Now I'm runnin' from the cop clan
'Cause my neighborhood told the cops: ""It was a black man""
Mr. and Mrs. Gilman next door
Puffin' on a joint, kinky to the core
And that's the typical role model
White picket fence, big house and a bottle

Digging through the sands of time to find my way back home
Your memory's the thing that keeps me hanging on
To know I'm not alone, we're stronger than the bonds of blood
Even on the darkest days together through the valley of the gun

Je donne jamais du mou
La vie c'est pas gentillesse!
j'tend jamais la joue c'est ma devise pour progress!
C’est mental offishall,
Force et courage ti mal!!!!
 
Faire vivre mes rêves, y'a personne qui m'en n'empêche,
J’ai testé la vie avec ou sans anti-sèche,
Elle m'a rouée de coups et elle m'a rendu fou,
Elle m'a foutu le blues mais je suis toujours debout!
Sur la route des problèmes, moi j'étais en panne sèche!
Les yeux inondés et le coeur en sécheresse,
Face à moi même j'ai vu l'ampleur des dégâts!
Je voulais lâcher l'affaire avec le son plus d'une fois mais...
J’donne jamais du mou

L’amour faut le mériter, le cœur à vif , ça tu vas détester...

C’est p't'être banal mais c’est comme ça que je progress,

Alors au mic j’tiens l’coup , je veille et pare 
Les coups en solo ou en crew,
Nous on nous cherche des poux!

Tant que ma family me supporte avec foi, moi

En panne de papier, en manque de gomme arabique
J’les ai vus traverser l’équivalent de l’Afrique
Red eyez, pour leur Red eyez

J’ai vu des sœurs excitées prenant l’odeur de la chronic
Puis ensuite regretter, quand arrive le bad trip
Moi perso j’ai flippé, quand c’est d’venu mécanique

Trying to love the little things, even if they're hard to love
A monument to love unspoken
Carved into stone, unwilling to come undone

It feels good to be running from the devil
Another breath and I'm up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds
It feels good for the first time in a long time now

I remember back in Oakland
I was lying there in rapture on the bathroom floor
Moving hotel to hotel
Out on the road, no idea really what's in store
Light it up just like a flashlight
Let it shine, let it rise just like a foreign sun
Turn it over and it's capsized
It's finally done, the battle's lost yet I feel I've won

It feels good to be running from the devil
Another breath and I'm up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds
It feels good for the first time in a long time now

It feels good for the first time in a long time now
It feels good to be me

I'm high, staring at the ceiling
Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling
What comes next, I see a light
I'm along for the ride as I'm taking flight

I'm high, staring at the ceiling
Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling
What comes next, I see a light

It feels good to be running from the devil
Another breath and I'm up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds
It feels good for the first time in a long time now

It feels good for the first time in a long time to be me
It feels good for the first time in a while I'm free

A rub dub, just relaxing in the tub, thinkin' everything was all right
Well, I stepped out the tub, put my feet on the floor
I wrapped the towel around me and I opened the door
And then a splish splash, I jumped back in the bath
Well, how was I to know there was a party going on?
 
Bing bang, I saw the whole gang dancin' on my livin' room rug (yeah)
Flip flop, they were doin' the bop, all the teens had the dancin' bug
There was Lollipop with Peggy Sue
Good golly, Miss Molly was a even there too
A well a splish splash, I forgot about the bath
I went and put my dancing shoes on

Ask to who? Maybe they can fund me moving out

Wearing a band of gold around your hooves
Collecting the stars, the glint of the stars
In your great and empty eye

The drink I drink is a drink as strong as
The strongest poison in the land
Riding on the back of my horse with his golden band
Who catches the stars in his eye

His great and empty eye
That had never smiled, never noticed me
I would like to think of that he dreamt of me
When he went to sleep at night

That he thought I was the special thing in his life
But to those great eyes, they see nothing
They don't profess poetry
Don't profess insight into me

Now I stand on empty man
Beside the stable door on the stud farm
And the green and gray attendant
Hands me straw, says, ""Go feed the horses""

You know, of course he's a dreaming talking horse
Who wears gold bands around his feet
And dreams of stars, and dreams of stars
In his empty eye, in his empty eye

A velvet voice is calling me
Yon this scornful deep blue sea
Take my hand, I'll follow thee
Into the sombre placid deep
Beyond the waves and far beneath
Where I can rest, forever free

I'm going under
In writhes I'm going down
In a lunar sea on the siren's night
Beneath the surface
I choke tenderly drown
And a thousand scornful sirens come around

Fear the sounding sea
Don't give in like me",Sirenian Shores,2005
Sirenia,"I can feel the eyes of your despair
Even where you're not here
I can feel your pain within myself
It's still keeping me down here
Life keeps on growing colder year by year
With a winter heart and my frozen tears
I stand lone to face my darkest fears

I've been wasting away, I' ve been fading inside
I've been drifting away from the lights in my life
I've been living in vain, living insane
I've been tripping down all the darkest of lanes

There's a shadow that dwells inside your head
Within mine as well
Turns our lives into a living hell
Like a curse and a spell
I've been drifting away from days of light
I've been swept away far into the night
I guess I'll never ever make it back

On a morning, a summer dawn
You speak in riddles and rhymes
From a distance your life it seems
Like a frozen heart in neon dreams",Absent Without Leave,2007
Sirenia,"I can see you walk out away
Turn your back on all your feelings
Seems you're loosing yourself again
To a void so devastating
And I can't deny I am the one,
The one to blame
For all your loss and your fading flame

Life it feels like a frozen winter dream
Like a silent scream
Life it feels like a thousand frozen tears
And the night dwells within me

I can see you break down again
All your life you've been bound to treason
On your knees and your tears descend
Oh your life's a fallen season
And time can not heal these wounds my friend,
Not again
So here you'll stand to face the end

Beyond the silence
Where your voices whisper to my heart
In the midst of December
On a night that comes without a star
I fall into darkness
Like I've done a thousand times before
I've burned all bridges
To the treacherous world outside my door",Downfall,2007

I will dance away with you
I never knew the pain would see us through
And though we fear the silence
We never ever realized
That life was only passing gently by

When the darkness seems to fall
Then I can hear you call
Your voice is clearer now than before
And in the summer rain
I'll carry all your pain
If I could only see you again

In the glades of summer
A light still wanes in you
Like winter days long gone
In midst of June
And though the cross feels lighter
On a warm midsummer night
Why do we then still feel so cold inside

Your voice is weaker now than before

Speaking to myself

And broken down bye the treason in your eyes
I've been turned around
Burned upside down by the fraud in all your lies

Feel the lights are fading within me
There's a void and a growing anxiety
I can feel the bitter end draws near
I concede this life has nothing more for me

I fall through rays of light
In the hours of redeeming
Last call and far too late now

You will never realize
What darkness lies inside
Inside my mind

If you are down
I will come to chain you to the ground
And penetrate your mind.
If you are lost *if only you are lost*
I'll be there to break your trust
And ravage all your lust for life, my love

But I can't lead you on, not this time

I've been dreaming for far too long
And my dreams all break one by one
I'm still standing, still facing the fall
Will I give in the distant calls

I've been watching your crumbling walls
I've endured a thousand tears or more

In search of better days
I've been strolling down the darkest of lanes
Just to find it's all in vain

The sundown gives birth to another night
As the moon comes crawling across the sky
My soul feels cold and my heart is tired
I'm burning inside, can't stop the flames, the fire

From a distance
I can see you pretend
That your life's on the mend
A thousand riverines weeping

I've faced all the ages all alone by myself
Never ending is the treason in every night and every day

And where the waves are raging free
Sing for me all of your sweetest melodies
And then let me drown into your arms into the sea

And they will have them eventually
Sing for me all sirens of the seven seas
Take me away, lead me astray in your deceitful ways

Hear a thousand voices calling me
Down by the deceitful sea they sing for me
The sirens of the seven seas
Their eyes are all fixed on me

On a stormy day from beneath the waves
I watched you slip away
And I knew it was far too late

It darkens all my pride and drives away the light

Darkness falls inside of me
And the sorrow's growing day by day
And though my life's a broken memory
There's a door and there's a key

Sorrow comes with silent tears
And the dawn still haunts my darkest fears
What have we both become throughout these years
There's a serpent in our tears

There is a river in my dreams that runs so wide, that runs so deep
And by its riverine I still can hear you weep
There is a winter in my heart so freezing cold and utter dark
It keeps me down and tears my sanity apart

Darkness falls inside of me
And the sorrow's growing day by day
And though my life's a broken memory
There's a door and there's a key

That I'm even still awake?
Still alive, still I take
Poison that debilitates

Fuck a little line
We can go ahead and kill a K
Livin' in the killer's state
Maybe that's a good excuse

See me taking shots at the bar
Like I'm bulletproof
Now my belly full of juice
I'm walking every day with a
Bruised lip, battered eye
Beat up stained liver

Wish I never tried none
Saturated chemical
But I don't wanna die mum
Maybe you could try some

No point wasting it
First it was a little bit
But now I got my face in it
Run around chasin' it

Everything is so hot
Everybody's screw faced
Looking like so raw
Pressure and it won't stop
Pushing up my heart rate
Arguments and attitude
Mate, you don't wanna start me

Listen man, I can't wait
Now I got a closed fist
Woke up shivering and
Swimming in my own piss
It's just my own risk

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,

And I don't know if you feel the same

I'm taking this time to write you this letter
Cause what we got is good but want to make it better
Yo boo, I'm digging you, you got all of the equipment
Now I'm ready for a commitment

I'm not trying to rush things
Not looking for an engagement ring
But the queen needs a king
And I choose you, cause what we got is in tune
Since you promised me the moon I hope to see it soon

I know you love it when I call you big poppa
My thoughts are pure
I heard you left your last cause she was insecure
I'm not tryin' to compare myself but
I got health and wealth
And now you dealing w/ the top shelf
My orgasmic thoughts need support
Thinking of positions you taught
While I stare at the gifts you bought

The things you do for me make you my number one
When you're around I have a lot of fun
Check me now
Like the time we went to six flags
Boostin', tearin off tags
And sticking souvenirs into our bags
Slipped up, almost got caught then tried again
You're more than a lover you my best friend

Do you remember the first time I letcha get it
I was nervous you were too but wouldn't admit it
You were the best I had that's why I want all of you
Now tell them hookers to stop calling you
I'm dead up I want to wear your name
So I pray and ask god to make you feel the same

(place to ease my mind)
(think about you all the time, yeah)
Show me a sign and wish that you would offer me a sign
Relax my mind

Let me close by saying stop delaying our fate
Let go your fear I'm here come hold your soul make
I want more but I don't want push
It's never to late so be straight
Don't beat around the bush

I'm all woman if you don't feel like I feel that's fine
Let's stay friends but I want you to be mine now check it
But I'll take what I can take it can't get no plainer
With love sincerely yours your boo dana

Oh p.s. guess who's back around
My ex he called me said he bought a house up town
But I told him that my love for you was too strong
Write back and don't make me wait to long

Everything in this world that a man could want
I got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still I'm lonely now
Pretty Faces from the covers of a magazine
From their covers to my covers want to lay with me
Fame and Fortune still can't find, just a grown man runnin' out of time

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't want to be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars, all the money don't amount to you
So I can make believe I have everything, but I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete
Without you girl my life is incomplete

Listen
Your perfume, your sexy lingerie
Girl I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday you told me you had fallen in love, I wasn't sure that I was
It's been a year Winter, Summer, Spring and Fall
But being without you just ain't livin' ain't livin'at all
If I could travel back in time, I'd relive the days you were mine

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't want to be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars, all of the money don't amount to you

I'd give anything and everything to hear you say, that you'll stay

All the expensive cars 
All of the money don't amount to you
So I can make believe I have everything 
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete

Listen
Your perfume, your sexy lingerie 
Girl I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was
It's been a year-winter, summer, spring and fall 
But being without you
Just ain't livin' nothing at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine

[Chorus]

I just can't help loving you
But I loved you much too late
I'd give anything and everything 
To hear you say that you'll stay.

You want to get freaky again, aight
A-ooh-ah-ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Lil' Kim:)
I've been a lot of places, seen a lot of faces
Ah hell I even f*** with different races
A white dude - his name was John
He had a Queen Bee Rules tattoo on his arm, uh
He asked me if I'd be his date for the prom
And he'd buy me a horse, a Porsche and a farm
Dan my nigga from Down South
Used to like me to spank him and cum in his mouth
And Tony he was Italian (Uh-huh)
And he didn't give a f*** (Uh-huh)
That's what I liked about him
He ate my pussy from dark till the morning
Called his girl up and told her we was bonin'
Puerto Rican papi, used to be a Deacon
But now he be sucking me off on the weekend
And this black dude I called King Kong
He had a big as* dick and a hurricane tongue

Beatin' they d*cks to the double-X-L; Magazine (uhh)
You like how I look in the aqua green? Get your Vaseline
Roll some weed with some tissue and close your eyes
Then imagine your tongue in between my thighs
Baby...ohh...yes ohh!
Jailer...open up...cell, block, eight
All right nigga, that's enough
Stop, look and listen; get back to your position
Kim got your dick hard, startin' fights in the yard
Hotter than a Pop Tart fresh out of the toaster
Niggaz do anything for a Lil' Kim poster
Eses, Bloods, Crips, all the thugs
Up North in the hole, they all want to know

How many licks does it take till you get to the centre of the?

If you drivin' in the street, hold on to your seat
Niggaz, grab your meat while I ride the beat
And if you see a shiny black Lamborghini fly by ya
(Shoom!) That's me the Knight Rider
Dressed in all black with the gat in the lap
Lunatics in the street - gotta keep the heat
Sixty on the bezel, a hundred on the rings
Sittin' pretty baby with a Cash Money bling
12 A.M. I'm on the way to club
After three bottles I'll be ready to f***
Some niggaz even put me on their grocery lists
Right next to the whip cream and box of chocolates
Designer pussy, my shit come in flavours
High-class taste niggaz got to spend paper
Lick it right the first time or you gotta do it over
Like it's rehearsal for a Tootsie commercial

And I stay smashin lip cause the shit was tight

If you thought it was sweet, ain't not tonight
I won't go that how and it ain't my life

Got a body like pow,
Make me want it right now
Drivin' me crazy while
I'm layin with my lady
I hope she don't see
It started one night,
After we had a fight
No make up, got me frustrated
And I'm actin'
So I took a shower and
Fell asleep in an hour
This hot, hot pretty
Young thang came
Picked me up with a bang-bang
Got me stuck and
I couldn't say a damn thing
Can't believe this scene
I'm feenin' for the
Girl in my dreams

CHORUS:
Last night had
A dream about a freak
Had me wakin' up in
Head from my sleep
The girl made me sweat,
Got my sheets all wet
And I don't even know
Who she be
She's fine as hell,
I can barely handle it
And oh the breasts
Got me all out of breath
So fine, on my mind every night
Trippin' off a dream,
But damn she was tight

Oh, I'm startin' to feel funny
Like I'm creepin' on my honey
It's a dream but it feels so real
Feel her body cover me
Waiting for the freak
When I'm with my lady
It's a shame,
I don't even know her name
But I know her measurements 36-24-36
Why am I seein' her eyes,
Them thighs
Could it be that love just hit me? 
In the form of a hot girl fantasy
I hate to say it but the
Lady drive me crazy
That girl, got me
Actin' shady to my baby
I can't shake the spell,
Can't break it 
Goin' crazy thinkin'
Of her butt naked
What to do every night I crave?
Girl I can't behave
Last nigh

Repeat chorus twice
Uh, got me goin' crazy
(Could it be my last chance?)
I don't know
(Ooh, ooh)
Oh
3-2-1

The vision of my lust 
Hunger for her touch
I can't understand 
I'm caught up in the
Thought of her so much
So at night I lay
Hennesy got me
Slowly driftin' away 

Baby I'm so confused
What am I gonna do?
But until then dreamin' 
Oh

And I pray that I never fall god protect me

Just to set the record straight homey

I'm not afraid (shit) no I'm not afraid of anything
And I swear that I'm goin' not be young forever
Pump ya fist pump ya disc never miss

In the dark then you do the same is you with me

Yeah. yo, where you at?
Yo, I'm at the airport I just got back from Paris

Oh word? Yeah. Where niggas at?
Oh, we all up in the studio
Oh it. Won't you drop this joint?
Yo I can't yo I might not be able to make it there
For real? Yo, I got a idea
Put the put the joint up to the phone
And I'm goin' I'm goin' just I'm just goin' rock to it, just over the phone
Ayo, yo put that joint on the big speakers
Yo, see get me some water yo
Turn it up real loud
I'm just goin' rock this joint yo go head, go head
Here it go. Press record
All eyes over here we about to show ya you know
Homies that's not here

Ayo my mental is keep the rock cut keep the glock up
Keep the rock pucks in the basement with the lock shut
Used to sliding under street lights with the peace pipe
Keep the heat tight by my side so I can eat right
All I knew is hit the block and how to crack deals
Make it hot with this rap shit and stack bills
All I'm used to is struggling juggling bugging
With thoughts in my head knowing crack kills
Out for papes gotta let the desert eagle blow
I get cake, this rap shit is legal though
Check the resume, slit that spit that
I put my name in the game Mr. Book
I'ma shine till a nigga can't shine no more
I'ma smoke so much weed I can't find no more
I'ma keep my chest bluish
Keep hitting 'em hard like Ray Lewis
Till they can't feel they spine no more

[Chorus:]
Oh, slow it down walk away and then you swear you heard this shit before
Niggas say they from the ghetto legend has that they from Baltimore
Get the niggas off the corners now and we goin' hold it down
Associated now we made it what can stop us now

Ayo we bash in brains
Then hit a nigga pockets for the last of his change
Then put a slash through his veins
Bullies of the block we harass in the game
With a sound that so hot it turn gas into flames
Keep jumping around like my raps entertain
Fuck around get beat down with some bats and some chains
When y'all was on them lots dropping cash on the range
I was tongue kissing blocks stashing them things
And now my nigga on only half of the chains
See the corners in the past but my ass is still deranged
I rumble in your ear like that flash when it rains
When I hits ya get the picture
Knock the glass out the frame
Rap for the name dope crack and cocaine
And I'ma drill it in your ear so you can lapse from the pain
And after the fame I'm going back to the wane
But for now nigga, feel the wrath from my game

[Chorus:]

The whole swell hold it down for my hometown
Show the world how we live how we feel we get down
That's my mission show up in my diction
Rep Baltimore every show till there's tension
Hate the fact that we iron we just go hard
High confidence got us feeling that we should bogard
Take over like bush did the poll sheets
A lot of rappers falling off 'cause the flow weak
That's what we here for to bring competition
Battle anybody we them four lynchmen
A yo I bet we won't lose what track you want to use
Let's do it acappella freestyle for your shoes
Nigga make it hot don't get it twisted
Dumb gifted. Baltimore once again if you missed it
Can't miss the butch make it hot Cooley High
Associates coming and we knocking niggas out

I'm free to fly like a bird

Unveiled take me away when

When I envision your eyes
You light up the sky
Holdin' my dreams in a cry
Now I feel my
Heart's been revealed
Hiding so long
Feeling all alone

Could never see myself
Without you living
So far from home
I could never
Be myself without you
Don't leave me alone

Soaring from a valley so low to
A mountain so high
What a life

Exploring why your love
Never grows old
Bo hug is too tight
This is right

You light up the sky

Like I was quit acting up bugging
Since when we been messing
Flexing love has been good no doubt
But now trying to get me on lock down
Trying to figure out what I'm all about
If I'm going out
Who I'm chilling with, what I'm dealing with?
Just can't, just can't handle it

You're not my girl and I'm not your man
I'm a tell you again so you understand
I'm not trying to be caught in, I'm not moving
Not budging not trying to get stuck in
Something I can't get out of

Need to get off of my back

Met you in the club you was bumping
Drunk as hell off the Henny with the thugs
And smoking something
I saw you wit your girlfriend acting like
You're cousins but cha really wasn't
Plus I caught you with the horny face and I loved it
So I took you to the crib for some fucking
Touching, hugging, lotta rubbing few hours later
Not busting I hollered at you

'Cause your body was right
And I stayed smashing 'cause the shit was tight
What was your plot coming here tonight?
If you thought it was sweet, it ain't not tonight
I won't go that route, it is not my life
I'm a baller you a dick, you need to get it right
Stuck in my ways now why you testing me
Need to stop stressing me you can't handle it

Never gonna have forever
With me you're not good enough to fill me
Nothing's changed from the beginning
This is the end so be it

I look and see a girl that I feel fatally attracted
Ain't trying to go home to the smell of old rabbits
That's why we going to chill till I instill it in your cabbage
The meaning of your space and to clarify your status
You ain't my Gina and I ain't your Martin
So chill with that crazy bullshit that you sparkin'
Pagin' off the hook like you bent off of Henrock
Reply's in your signature smothering my inbox
Call all the time but never saying nothing
You for now when you call boo, you get the end button

So why you keep binoculars and like a cuffing
You gray baring me
Nah better yet fuck that boo
You scaring me
Fuck you want to marry me

Sisqó,"Bright Lights, Fancy Restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
I got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still I'm lonely now
Pretty Faces from the covers of a magazine
From their covers to my covers want to lay with me
Fame and Fortune still can't find, just a grown man runnin' out of time

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't want to be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars, all the money don't amount to you
So I can make believe I have everything, but I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete
Without you girl my life is incomplete

Listen
Your perfume, your sexy lingerie
Girl I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday you told me you had fallen in love, I wasn't sure that I was
It's been a year Winter, Summer, Spring and Fall
But being without you just ain't livin' ain't livin'at all
If I could travel back in time, I'd relive the days you were mine

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't want to be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars, all of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything,but I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete
That without you girl

I just can't help lovin' you
But I loved you much too late
I'd give anything and everything to hear you say, that you'll stay

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't want to be a lonely fool
All of the women, all of the expensive cars, all of the money don't amount to you
(you can have it all) I can make believe I have everything,
but I can't pretend that I don't see (Just give me my baby)
That without you girl my life is incomplete

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't want to be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars, all the money don't amount to you
So I can make believe I have everything, but I can't pretend that I don't see

The words will never show
The you I've come to know

If a face could launch a thousand ships
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you
You're all that left me too

And when my love for life is running dry
You come and pour yourself on me

If a girl could be to places
At one time, I'd be with you
Tomorrow and today
Beside you all the way

If the world show stop revolving
Spinning slowly down to die
I'd spend the end with you
And when the worlds was through

Then one by one the stars would all go out
Then you and I would simply fly away

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care

Is waiting strong and true

For this child of mine
She?ll forever shine

And you kiss my lips and tickle my chin

Going where the lost ones go

The near and the dear ones, the old and the young.

A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear.

But your blind if you can't see
That his love is holding me

I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make it

How can they turn their eyes and walk away?
How can the blue bloods hide while brothers killing brothers?
Why do they divide I and I for diamonds and gold?

And wires and watchtowers can't bring their demise
Tell me, why, oh, why are we so blind?
The treasures of love lay buried inside
Tell me, why, oh, why do we deny?

Like a well that has no end

Cause a friend in love is a friend in need 
There's a soul out there that yours wants to find
Set your spirit free and I said

Let me tell you about something that you don't know.

But I've been sinkin', I've been sinkin'.
Well I tried to find a corner in my mind leave it all behind 
But I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'.
We can put it all together babe, we've got plenty of time 
I remember sittin' 'neath the stars, talkin' 'bout love in a broken down car. 
He said what are we gonna do we've lost our way 
And love keeps gettin' in the way.

Said love's not a time or convenient place.

Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.

I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.

Where I go    That's for me to know and ...
Now I lead    And I will not follow. 

My hands they bleed from the pounding on the door.
I fell face down and still I pounded on the floor.
My hear it hurts and my throat it's gettin' sore.
But I'll talk my way, I'll talk my way
And then I'll talk some more.

Tomorrow dawn it lights the way for me,
Down a road that goes on and on And on and on and on ...
Just survivin' it ain't the way to be.
Tried it once and it took it's toll on me.

He hesitated, never acted in the now.
I never waited, wiped the sweat off of my brow.
They congregated so I looked at them and bowed.
And I'll have my way, I'll have my way,
And never turn around.

Wonder if I'll always be with you

Sister Hazel,"On final approach my brother and I  we were so sure 
Knew exactly the plans we'd made and what we were here for 
Didn't have a care in the world  got by day by day 
Struggled with the plans we'd made who was I anyway 

Workin' on both night and day  in a famous rock and roll cafe 
Never thought I'd meet a girl for me 
Never thought I'd meet a girl called Cerilene 

Cerilene  the road of life is dark without you and I, I just can't see 
Cerilene, share my life with me 
We'll go together hand in hand and we'll fulfill our dreams 

Walked along the beach there hand in hand, it felt like a dream 
But things that felt so good were never real or so it seemed 
The magic that this girl possessed 
Changed the heart of a child to a man (to a man) 
Through the warmth of love his dreams and drive had direction again 

A girl who strongly believes in me, and visions that we both could see 
As one of my dreams, it came to an end 
My life and love felt whole again 

[Chorus]
I've grown to love this family, my friends 
And this woman that I've found 
Just as much as the family I left in a small, small Southern town 
On a day the island breezes brought my loved ones here with me 
We made our families one, I love you, oh I love you Cerilene 

Cerilene, the road of life is dark without you and I, I just can't see 
Cerilene, share my life with me 
We'll go together hand in hand and we'll fulfill our dreams 
Cerilene, share my life with me, on this island oh, fulfill my dreams

Where's the pride and the glory
Where's the pot of gold

I'd forgotten what it meant to me
Some things we should carry from the past
There's a boy and he's singin'
And in the wind his words are ringin'
His innocence, it is buried in us all

Now I look and see
That boy inside of me
May have seen a storm or two
But the dream is alive

Sister Hazel,"I'll go away
I'll go on my wordless way
Don't say anything
Say nothing, just leave me. 

I've been merely, an actor
In your painful play.
But I feel too much to stay.
Just cast me out. 

[Chorus]
You can have the pictures 
You can have the jacked up car.
And take the book on meditation
I'll just take home what I brought, 
My, big painted velvet Elvis... 

Well take it away
Take it all away
Don't leave anything
Leave nothing, except me 

'Cause I've been sadly misinformed
I thought it mattered a little more than this
I wish I was a thousand miles away... 

[Chorus] 

Well I'm frozen here
Caged in silence
It's better that I 
Regret these words 
Than to stand aside 
And watch your tragic
Storyline unfold...
Just let me go 

[Chorus]

Well you took my heart 
And you took my soul
And you used me,
I've had plenty of that.
It gets harder and harder
And farther and farther
From what I need for me.",Elvis,2000

Tastes a lot like winter
And will it- release me 

So heavy

And I've been feelin' sorry 
For myself
And I've been resurrecting my
Fortress to protect myself

Can you-even hear hear me?
What do you expect out of me
I'm being buried alive and screaming 
Can't you see - Can't you see me ?

Weary
My hands slapped I'm cautious and leary

Without my home - I'm so lost...

Don't stand there smiling, at me 
Don't think it's me

Why even bother if I'm always wrong.
Give in, give out, give up, it's over.
So much for trying it's time to move on. 

You try, to back, me in, a corner.
So sick of playin' your game.
Too much, too hard, to take, You're giving.
So much that I don't need.

I've heard the same old lines
I'm tired, worn out, so weak, don't push me.
Don't try it one more time.

If she's out there somewhere-somewhere 
I would give everything to know.
Just to hold and to finally have her,
Take me to sunrise from indigo

I'll try not to cry much
So no one will see
But if it's to be

It took so long but you believed

What did you want 
And why would you want it at all?

For a wondering Jones
I'm here but you look right through me

I wonder how I'll ever get through
Then I think of the things you said

May seem like a strange cup of tea,
But if its all right with you than it all 
Right with me

In my arms I'll hold another day

And with my hand to my face I pray 

There's times I feel with the stains of life 
I could just turn around, turn around walk away 
Then a strength like a beam from above 
Lifts me up by the hand and it leads me to say
Good things for good people you see
Good things they seem to all work out

If its all right with you well then its all right with me

I know what I like I like what I see
I'm not only flesh and blood but 
I'm heart and soul I know 

Sometimes I feel at the end of the day
Was it worth while or have I settled for less
I sit back and your there by my side sincerely you say, 
We're both so blessed
Count your blessing count them one, two, three 
Don't give up cause it'll all work out

Sister Hazel,"With my head above the water 
I can breathe to stay alive
But I'll try a little harder 
If you want me to survive 

Won't somebody tell me?
How I got to this stage?
When consequence is inconsequential
And
Staring in the spotlight
Is better than real life 

It's been surreal, how do you feel
When the seas part before your eyes
It's just so real how does it feel
When the stars that follow die 

With my head above the water
I could drift along, beyond the tides
But I can try a little harder
If you help me to reach the other side.

When the colors have left you blind
It's just so real how does it feel
To have left yourself behind",Surreal,2000

That brought me to my senses

Far away 'til you could not find me

Liberated and you're far behind me

And I'll make some time

About the things that you don't understand

It's all about the love
It's everything you've been thinking of
It's all about the love

Give it up for love

These days in the gallows
I'm kneeling at the block
With my neck outstretched
And I should've stayed in the shallows

Carry me through another day

I can see it falling off their face

By losing faith
Bein' guided by fears
And I'm hangin' on every word
With the hopes that you can
Help me away, and its all I know
Oh, how death don't like to let you go
It's killin' me to see you slippin' away, yeah

Cause you can't even look at me
No, you can't even speak to me
No, you can't even walk with me
Until I save myself
Oh, I have to save myself

Now the systems we have placed
To protect ourselves
Are hard to erase
And the egos that we bring
Are the guarding walls that have brought us this far
And its all I know, That addictions don't like
To let you go
It's killin' me to see you, slippin' away, yeah

No, you can't even speak to me

Are familiar ghosts that won't go away
And the patterns that we break
Are the only hope that can shatter their grip

Waiting for someone to come by
One little Christmas tree that never had grown
Cried as he looked up to the sky

Could one little Christmas tree so tiny and small
Light up someone's home? 'Cause

One little Christmas tree can light up a home
So one little child can find a toy
One little Christmas tree can light up a home
So one little heart can find some joy

One little angel who was riding a star
Cried as she looked down at the tree
Please Mr. Father tree, wherever you are
May I give him the star you gave to me?

Then in the heavens came a voice from afar
A voice that was heard throughout the world
Go down little angel girl and give him your star
For tonight he'll light the world, whoa

One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So those who are lost may find their way
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So all men may see you on Christmas Day

She blowed and throw'd on the airbrakes

She was tippin cars on automatic switch

When she run 'cross the last one
She squalled in

She commenced to singing an crying

It was summer, we were so in love.

Look at me, I'm thrilled to your touch.

We sat in the booth where it all began

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed

You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell

And then change that truth into love

I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As,2000

So what you want to do

Baby I love you so
But you don't feel like I do
Tell me what can I do

But I gotta be strong
You did me wrong
When I thought that we were really down
So you say you want me
Make up your mind
'Cause I'm not gonna be here for long

Baby, baby in time
Baby I know you'll find
That what you needed was here
And think about it my dear

You got me twisted
Thinking about the way that things use to be
When It was you and me girl I was so free
See you had my life
Like Cupid and I was just down right foolish and stupid
But now I know the reason for the pain and the headaches
You left me all alone now I can't even concentrate
I guess I'll wait for the day until you come back
Because my heart is where your love is at
You got me twisted

Sister Souljah,"(Intro):
(Man says): We're gonna slow it down at this time
And sing a soulful number.
This song is a song that, why' know, we all want to sing sometime
why' know what I mean?  This is the love crowd right?
We all love each other, don't we?
Ai-ight?  ""All right!""
Let me hear you say yea!!!!
""Yeah!!!!!""

(Verse 1)
I needed love from somewhere. Somebody to interpret.
My mother was supposed to, but she's far from perfect.
My body was young.  Feeling n' thoughts were so sexual.
No one to explain, so my body had no schedule.
And when it was right, or if the time was wrong.
My nursery rhyme turned to a passionate song.
So we tossed n' turned. Burning in heated sweat.
No one ever explained.  There's nothing to forget.
An explosion of rain like there is in a storm:
Body wet.  Heart beating.  Body burning and warm.
No mama never said to say no, not even how to
Tell one from another, or what to expect to
Go for or demand, except or reject,
Or when to say yes.  And also to protect.
So I had no choice.  I imitated what I saw.
My mother had one man, plus three, equals four:
One for his car, one for his job, and one for spite.
And one did her right as I listened in the night.

(Chorus)
(In background a lady sings): ""Souljah, Souljah, Souljah, Souljah!""

(Man say's): The children cannot raise themselves!
The television, the baby sitter, the radio cannot raise your children! 
Anything you want the children to know, you must teach them!  
You must teach them!
If you do not teach the children, they will not know. 
They will not know!

(Verse 2)
Now she yelled and hollered, and sometimes even screamed.
And never explained quite what she would mean.
Mad at the world for the way she never understood.
And if she couldn't explain, what makes you think I could.
So there's life in my belly-or say, ""A biscuit in the oven""-
Kicking and hitting, and pushing and shovin'.
And my biggest fear is that it'll ask me those questions.
All I'm qualified to give are mistakes and confessions.

(Interlude)
""I never thought that this would cause so many problems. 
I wish I had somebody to talk to.
God, I'm so confused?""

Now a cycle repeats over and over again.
Make it topsy turvy: the lives of women and men.
Bringing life into the world should be considered a blessin',
But it isn't 
when you haven't been taught the lessons
Of motherhood?
Now, adoptions not an option. Not even abortion.
Won't make the baby pay for societies distortion.
Got to go for self, despite societies abuses.
Schools built to destroy minds.  Upset and confused.
Met a friend the other day.  She said her name was Souljah.
She said, ""I'm here to tell ya what your mama never told ya.""
""Raise your child"" she said.  ""Raise your head like a warrior.
If you don't, the world will destroy ya.
We need your baby: mind body and soul
To reestablish the laws of the old,
Wise, life-giving ways of our people.""

(Chorus)
(In background a lady sings): ""Souljah, Souljah, Souljah, Souljah!""

(Man say's): The children cannot raise themselves!
The television, the baby sitter, the radio cannot raise your children! 
Anything you want your children to know, you must teach them!  
You must teach them!
If you do not teach the children, they will not know. 
They will not know!

(Verse 3)
She said, ""Girl, you're original.  And that's definite.
You're first.  Your wisdom is infinite.
Ex-plore your mind.  You have so much to give.
If you seek knowledge, you'll have reason to live!
In a war, 
there can be no excuses.
Two camps: 
the used and the users.
Your mind:
You've got to read and nourish.
Your talent
Then unfolds and flourish.
We can't blame your mom.  We know she did what she could.
But girl, you've got to be twice as good!

(Chorus)
(In background a lady sings): ""Souljah, Souljah, Souljah, Souljah!""
(Man say's): The children cannot raise themselves!
The television, the baby sitter, the radio cannot raise your children! 
Anything you want the children to know, you must teach them!  
You must teach them!
If you do not teach, they will not know. 
They will not know!",Umbilical Cord to the Future,1992

When you're away, it's hard to sleep at night
So, my pillow, like my thoughts of you, I hold tight

Girl, I never thought I'd find someone to love me
Now, you're the only one I want in my life
And the special tough you give comes from you only
I guess that's why you're always on my mind

You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind

Every day of my life I got out of my mind thinking
How I was wrong and you won't be mine.
Take another look could I change your mind?

Let me tell you I'd doe anything to be your everything
Even though you're hurt give it one more try
Let me tell you I'd do anything to be your everything
You say I left you nothing but a bitter taste

You say I locked you in a cage
Say I pushed you over, say I made you crawl

Got a safe job
And you can call a little house and Chevy your own

You've been craving for this
And now you're stuck just like a snail in it's shell

All that matters is that you can be free to live your
Life the way you sincerely feel it
Cause life's too short
You don't want to be a prisoner of your own illusions
And I shout it out

You could be so happy
You got somebody to love
You could be so happy

Ain't no use to sit and drag it on,

Nothing's wrong, just bring it on

You jerk

You are such a jerk
There are other words
But they just don't work

Sometimes I wish I'd mailed you that letter
That said the things I dare not say
Instead I set the thing on fire
I had to say this out loud anyway

I'm so glad I found the nerve
To say what you deserve

You jerk

You are such a jerk
There are other words
But they just don't work

They try to be so cool
Insult you like a fool
Never take your call when you're nobody at all
Until you're somebody
And then they want to be your friend
How comes jerks don't know they're jerks (I don't know)

So next time someone makes you feel little
Just sing this song inside you head
And like a great big cartoon bubble
These lovely words will dance above their head

Impossible vain
You told me I was totally without shame
I thought to myself
This kind of luck is my middle name
Boy you need to know
Sometimes I think I'm out of my head
The bigger the words
The stranger I feel
So give me a chance to explain
And erase all bad things
I've said

You tell me I'm selfish,delirious
That's not what I am
I tell you I'm speechless,Do do do do
You know who I am
I've got a little sparkle,Do do do do
Inside of me
And you tell me I'm selfish,delirious

In between days
I wanna paint a rainbow
To cover all the gray
In between days
I wanna kiss and tell to end
This game we play
I wish you could read my mind

You tell me I'm selfish,delirious
That's not what I am
I tell you I'm speechless,Do do do do
You know who I am
I've got a little sparkle,Do do do do
Inside of me
And you tell me I'm selfish,delirious

Tell me do you cry
I cry all the time
Tears that are turning to ice
I cry
Sparkle come alive
Sparkle that melt I

I wish you could read my mind

You tell me I'm selfish,delirious
That's not what I am
I tell you I'm speechless,Do do do do
You know who I am

Yeah I've been learnin'
All of the art of playin' by heart
See I'm burnin'
Just out of school of breakin' the rules
Yeah I've been hurtin'
Findin' the key,the code to what's me
Now I'm certain
I feel what life's about
Still I'm just finding out

Strong winds are turning deep inside
And I feel it,and I know it
Strong winds are blowin' all around
And I ride,and I ride,and I ride
Strong winds are learnin' me to fly
And to make it
Strong winds are movin' me around

Never look down but always think twice
That's what ma mama told me
Changes will come when the future is bright
Yeah you'll see it comin'
Like the fool on the hill in need of the thrill
Pushin' you slowly
Nobody else but you and yourself
Have to worry

You'll find a time and a place
Just when you stop the chase

Voices inside will let you know
When it's time to just let go
Don't be afraid of what you feel
Just be ashore of that it's real

Strong winds are turning deep inside
And I feel it,and I know it
Strong winds are blowin' all around
And I ride,and I ride,and I ride
Strong winds are learnin' me to fly
And to make it
Strong winds are movin' me around

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time

Were at the best place around

Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
