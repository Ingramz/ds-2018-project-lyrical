Sho Baraka,"I was taught that living the good life meant getting everything I could
But I've been shown a brand new picture of the good life, and it's glorious

Aye I was raised in that lone star state where we go hard
Can't do it small at all, 'cause big things our state
My dreams as a buck was to make a large bank
Daddy told me be the best, no one can tell me I can't
Be the best baller, or be the best rapper
Got a little older, and went after the latter
Grind until I shine, trying to climb that ladder
Grab a couple girls, 'cause your boy looked dapper

But at a young age, I saw I had it wrong
Full of drive, but moving in reverse all along
Dreams full of pride, heart full of stone
You know I had to redefine what I grind on
Success is dangerous if you don't do it right
He gave us everything for pointing to him right
So toast to the king who gave me some new dreams
Everything for his name, that's how I do things

[Chorus]
Never knew how lost I was 'till I found out
That I couldn't hear his voice, it was drowned out
I was chasing things, selfish dreams
Now I see what he has for me
It's the good life

(Wake up!) I grew up with those doctrines and those angels
When wings get mangled and they rock a broken halo
Success is an idol from Hollywood to Diego
No hablo if you don't speak with the pesos
And their favorite dollar sign is too much
More greed, more lust, more taste, more touch
I had an appetite that ate from the devil's power
With every bite 'cause he would rise
I'm kissing my life goodbye

If I find I have a need this world cannot meet
Then I know this life is a place where my hope should not be
I've been chasing those things that are real fake
This is not a real place, this is a dream state
Functional saviors ain't hip, their a real waste
What's the palace going off of without a major king
Pain, sorrow, and empty treasures
Spite the creator and deem creation simply better

The ward off is a lot of things, but it's really lying
And to the Lord, the good life is really dying
I'm the Lord's procession, so my heart's in the heavens'
True religion in my jeans, now stop guessing

[Chorus]

Even the sun goes down, heroes die eventually
Great careers end in the industry
Empires implode; you may go down in history
But everything will go down eventually
Look, you can stack bread, but you can't stop death
And there will be no comforter for you in that bed

We all get laid out, the games get played out
In a maze headed to the grave, and there's no way out
You can't outlast life, it fades out fast
Death is coming for us all, everything's gonna pass
So look at it from that angle down
My dreams gotta be bigger and greater than that

I was with the persecuted martyrs in Asia
Were living out their dreams, though they was walking in danger
Their dreams were lifting up the heart of the savior
And living in a way that shows that he's all that they wait for
One's stacking up the cake, but one's walking in favor
Living a good life, 'cause they walk with the maker

My dreams are different, you know that I've been changed now
The good life is the life that's been laid down.
The good life
Yeah it's the good life
The good life
Yeah it's the good life",New Dreams,2011
Sho Baraka,"Who's got the power?

The key to life: money, power, respect
Louie this, Gucci that, two private jets
Big money, big business, watch that paper stack
Treat life like a game, it ain't pool but I'm racked
Up, big bucks, no whammys
I swear I prolly lump somebody head for a Grammy
My heart black as the Lambo Kim bought for Kanye
And I ain't fronting, I'm just telling ya'll what God say
Blood thirsty
Seek my own will since the day that Adam cursed me
The lust for power go to ya' brain if you let it
You say, ""What up dog?"" I hear ""god."" I'm so dyslectic
Sit on the throne, it's really a toilet, heart is septic
I have no power, I get handed death, I must accept it
It's hard to see the light when you never listen
Our whole life's blacked out, the power's tripping

[Chorus]
Who's got the power?
Do you really want it all, whole world in ya' palm? Tell me, 
Who's got the power?
It'll make you a leader or a tyrant, you do the decidin'
Who's got the power?
Do you really want it all, whold world in ya' palm? Tell me, 
Who's got the power?
It'll make you a leader or a tyrant, you do the decidin'

It was all a dream
I grew up readin' hip-hop magazines
Double-XL got me wanton to excel
They tellin' me it ain't hard to tell, I rock well
And now with every sale I'm feelin' my head swell
Well, I'm a genius in my dreams
Even if I was, it was stitched inside my genes
I'm self-inflated, self-infatuated
And somehow I convinced myself I finally made it
The truth is I was made like the mob
Geppetto put me together; my strings lead to God
Pride come befo' the fall, I seen it in the script
So if you see me fallin', prolly a power trip

[Chorus]

Welcome to the culture where humility is not allowed
They do it big, if you don't see that, you Shallow Hal
Tryna show them how love and power, it goes together
If they call us losers, that just means we last forever
I been connected to the power, I don't have to chase it
I roll with the Trinity, this is sorta the Matrix
A hard pill to swallow: we're evil to the core
Wicked power exploits the poor, and it brings war
Power can be a field of dreams loaded with land mines
We know the ruler so you can't say these are bad lines
(You might lust for that power! ), but don't forget that we're forgiven
I know the Lord gon' catch me when I'm power trippin'

Who made the crowd put they hands in the sky? Me.
Who made the sky with they hands? What if y'all can't see?
This is kinda strange, God makes the weather change
And we braggin' up on our change like ""look how we make it rain!""
We Invictus, this sin sickness is in us
Running a muck and causing that mischief, tell me this then, ""Who could really fix us?""
I'm, trippin' to think that I'm really not limited in this position in sitting in, 
Gravity pulling me back to earth gradually, reality's hittin'

Sho Baraka,"Don't mean much
It don't mean much to me

Yo, so they may be like Kevin you got it goin' on
In twenty years they'll forget me like Kevin in Home Alone
Sown, grown and blown, mown and then its gone
That's the history of grass, and man ain't much more (Talk about it)
(Hit me) No one will care what you invented
Half the stuff that we use we can care less 'bout the origin
Listen, I ain't trippin' I love to lift up inventions
But more than liftin' inventors, who invented the inventor That's God (Talk about it)
My whole clique Christ lovers,
My outfit it might be plain, but I'm fly with the right brothers
Life covered, Jesus he saves well
Free's the mind for those doin' time in a brain cell
Jesus 'til I expire, I may have a good year of
Fire stones fall from the sky, I'll never tire

Secret of the dark
Everything, everything the world wants
It don't mean much
It don't mean much to me

Yeah, Lord sometimes its envy on my lips, lust on my hips
Feet prone to slip because I'm so weak
We often fake like we're meek, say we're the least, speak deep 
But the Lord is like son please
We exaggerate our strengths, hide our mistakes
That's a bad place, cuz we only make his grace cheap
When I'm angry my pride wants to slay me
I know one person who needs to take up his cross daily, that's me
Yeah, and our deepest desires might be the worst thing
Our hearts are wicked, you don't know what that curse brings
I get something new then I look at you
If you have one and a litle that that, I want two, greed
We have peasants mimicking' the life of kings
Yeah you have fame and things, you never had peace
Made in his image, but then we made a mess
Win, lose, or draw, he's a picture of success
Say cheese

You make a song about Jesus, you never going to hell
Yeah that's written in the first book of (what was it) nowhere
I know that's no bail , but his fare won't go well
Lord help us 'fore our days end, like a hotel
'Cuz death doesn't care how many albums you sold
And death doesn't schedule like this time or no
Death clock reading it's sooner time to go
But it'll be soon time to go
Chose God and grow
Watch the throne all you want, but it'll never be your seat
The throne's occupied like it's palace on Wall Street
My God so great that He puts great to shame
Ain't a man bad enough, he ain't bad enough to save
Jesus, came here to save the worst of sinners
How you think I'm able to rap these verses with Him
To the earth He entered

Haters can't touch this we Too Legit to Quit all we need is some Hammer pants and an s-curl kit
Some will celebrate someone want you to struggle
Don't get bent out of shape but just keep those Squares Out Your Circle
We too mature to be acting like teenagers
Acting like I'm fake to impress these strangers somebody must have found the Fountain of Youth. Bottled it up and didn't give that bottle to you!
We stay dating with no expiration put the kids to sleep and have adult conversations
Far from drunk but what's in my cup is only for the heads in the room that's 30 and up

Girl you know we got to work to stay in love
When I'm feeling high when I'm feeling low

Yeah that new Peter and Paul
Gordon Parks, off the charts
It's Kobe without a ball

Booker T, giving knowledge for cheap
Smart and cool, that's a college degree
Excellent like building strong families through years of oppression
There is no recession when all you know is the great depression
Reading Phillis Wheatley I'm tryna avoid the greedy
Mother Teresa in sneakers, tryna serve the needy
Cool in school, FAMU & Tuskegee
New school educators - Dhati and Thabiti
Focused like Moses but I'm feeling ill-equipped
I'm praying for a rod and the Red Sea to split
A crew to hold me up and a pharaoh to beef wit'
Just point me to the promise, I'm exiting Egypt

Serena with nothing but love, we still serve the haters
Feeling old, gimme soul, rap Leon Bridges
When I commit to drop these hits, y'all gon' need some stitches
Excellent
Fight for justice from creation to the tomb
I know Black lives matter, and they should matter in the womb
I don't do a lot of talking
Most of you who claim you woke are really sleep walking
Praying for the strength so I can fight for the people
Only thing I'm afraid of is God and my ego
Following false heroes, giving my vote to Nero
If they Marshall Law I'm playing Danny DeVito

Excellent it's when information turns into wisdom
Excellent like the peace that came with Mandela out the prison
Excellent it's knowing I'm not defined by the wealth and stuff
Get the rich, line 'em up, they'll tell you money is not enough
Forgive us Lord 'cause we want love without truth
The world is spiritually poor 'cause we want heaven without you
It's malpractice, we want healing without patience
We don't want a heart transplant, we want facelifts
I was poetic so they forgave my poor ethics
A misogynistic skeptic with methods of good aesthetics
I was so dirty, unworthy and insufficient
I don't worry, he loves me when when I'm inconsistent
Commitment greater than talent, service over status
Passion over tactics, I don't drive your bandwagon
I keep grinding until they name a climate after me
Until it's common knowledge you jokers shouldn't be rhyming after me
I'm wired to be inspired by the lovers and the haters
I take it to different levels like I'm rapping on elevators
If you reaching for the top you better learn to survive
You can either fall or fly when you reaching for the sky
Fly excellent
Or fall excellent
But never quit
Never quit","Excellent, 2017",2016
Sho Baraka,"I'm a lover, a provider
I'm a teacher, I'm a fighter

How do you spell dad?
It goes L-O-V-E
How do you spell dad?
It goes L-O-V-E

Son in the land of the passive make sure that you man up
When introduced to a lady its always proper to stand up
Never talk behind the back of someone you're not a fan of
Know when the cops approach you, you might have to put your hands up
Respect all people and show honor to the king
No matter what they think the Lord created all human beings
Be critical, but never partner with defiance
Be happy with who you are all alone in the silence
Pray without ceasing, but keep your eyes on the system
Always speak up for the weak until somebody listens
Don't marry her if you don't plan to bury her
If you sweep her off her feet then learn how to carry her

Through thick and thin you know we gon' hold it down
Through good or bad you know we gon' stick around

It goes L-O-V-E

You better believe I know that may be hard to achieve
You're beautiful, I will always remind you
Never let the culture's idea of beauty define you
Baby girl don't be easily impressed
Stay clothed in righteousness cause it's harder to undress
I'm tryna raise the next Lena Horne
Fannie Lou Hamer a lady who can bring reform
Be wise and strong
Don't be a side chick for the ride along
Always be humble whether right or wrong
And know I'll be here when your friends are gone
When your friends are gone

If you want love, get love
If you need love, spread love

Yeah, I got new goals its family business I handle now
The kind of stuff that brothers over thirty be bragging 'bout
Tell my son that he's more than some target practice
Tell my daughter that she's more than an extension to a mattress
Never reach a goal by pulling others down
Royalty is much more than a throne and a crown
Your knees should be hurt from praying with your people
Your shirt'll be wet from crying over evil
I learned that love ain't based on performance
Make a mistake and I will love you in the morning
I see life in my children's eyes
And when I'm wrong I'll be the first to apologize
Peace to all my fathers who are working through their flaws
Fulfilling their duties and they don't do it for applause
It's true, any fool with a tool can reproduce
But a father is that dude that'll see it through
Forget the stereotypes lets be clear
There are good men out there we are here

Through thick and thin you know we gon' hold it down
Through good or bad you know we gon' stick around

Yeah, hello
Quick introduction before I narrate
I'm from the west, between Cornel and Kanye
I grew up between section eight and cloud nine
During my youth I lost my sense of being colorblind
In between white supremacy and black nihilism
AME churches, corner stores and the prison systems
Hoteps and preachers on the block, they was dropping wisdom
I would pick it up and just give it a little rhythm
They said my lineage had a couple of kings
A couple queens, a couple thieves, a couple fiends
Despite the struggle, I was teached that we are equal
I fall short like a midget but I'm down for the people
The people, argue I died with integration
Their false liberation is really assimilation
The youth view my history with some suspicion
They wanna progress past religion and tradition

Hello average, let me introduce you to awesome
That Harlem renaissance age had some excellent artists
That miseducation, that midnight marauding
That life before Eve ate that fruit in the garden
They say 'You might be on the wrong side of history'
Well, that depends on who's writing
Who's reciting, who's typing and who likes it
If we want peace somebody has to do the fighting
We exit Egypt, happy to speak resistance
Then turn around, and ask pharaoh for his assistance
Huh, what is logic to the ignorant?
What's forgiveness to people who think they're sinless?
We are those, fully exposed, Adam and Eve hiding our weakness
Folks who wanna be close but the devil stands between us
Who knows the dirty souls with an urgent need to be cleaned up
They oppose my solution, everybody hates Jesus

Don't close the book, I got more to write

Yeah, was protesting a law?
Should I pray or should I write?
Do I want peace, or do I want power so I can try it?
Who's gonna give the truth when these church moms retire?
When censorship gets you fired and nobody gets inspired
I don't care what you look like, black, white or magenta
I don't care where you come from, Africa or placenta
We all desperate and broken, given the same dilemma
Do I serve God, or do I make off in my agenda?
I remember thinking I was Daniel with the lions
I'm like Israel in hiding when it's time to fight Goliath
I've been broken, I've seen death working
I've fought doubt, I've been knocked out, I know what hurt is
I run from the truth, but I know where church is
I failed doing my job but yet I know my purpose
Praise Jesus I was blind but now I see
But my problem is I think I see too many things

Let us chiropractic crack open the spine of this book
Turn a few pages and take a deep look
This is not the Catcher in the Rye
This is the African who caught the slave catcher's eye
Yet an invisible man who has the whole world watching
Shall we meet the protagonist?
For I am the colored cog in the capitalist wheel
With baby faced bronze skin and melon and a peel snatched from the craterless civilization
My name is Louis Portier
Arrived on these shores but I've got more to say
From Bali to Barbados to Beaufort, South Carolina
Sierra Leone to Sapelo
Sugar cane on my fingertips and shackles on my feet
There are limitations to a man so pity me until I sunk my tooth into Jude's freedom
Tastes like grandma's sweet potato pie
But it goes from master's plantation to mass incarceration
As the Jim Crow flies, all of this happened, more on less
This is up from slavery, meets Porgy and Bess
August Wilson, and Kenya Barris
James Brown and James Burr
Kehinde Wiley, and Cara Walker
George Carrothers, Clinton and Washington
Carver, the great migration and reconstruction
From black wall streets, to Harlem Artilliers
This is black survival and success, put on full display
Whether it's the Little Rock, or the Charleston Nine
Trying to integrate, or praying to stay alive
Thinking that if my work was good somehow y'all would recognize my personhood
But nah, instead I had to hustle this chocolate charm
This black brilliance, this ebony ingenuity
I know what this nation has done, can do, and is doing to me
Also what it could be and therefore still, I rise
From 1619 and beyond here I stand
From being three-fifths of a compromised plan
Using the breath in my black lungs
Shouting words from a place of black love
'I am a man'","Foreward, 1619",2016

If you're here for the love, if you're here for the love, for the love (can the church say amen?)
If you're here for the love, if you're here for the love, for the love (amen, amen)
If you're here for the love, if you're here for the love, for the love (can the church say amen?)
If you're here for the love, if you're here for the love, for the love (amen, amen)

Yeah
What up Sho?
Just like old times, right?
Look, I'm here for the young'uns with they pants saggin'
And homies is flaggin, some say 'What up 'cause?' or 'What's bracking?''
Nothin' lacking on the corner, bread stacking
Pray to God that nobody have to toe tag 'em
He ain't be trapping in a minute
Use the re-up money for the tithes and the rent
Told his baby momma that he love her any minute
Pastor dipped him in that water after he repented
Granny told him he don't need a souvenir in church
Straight up out the street, think he made the deacons nervous
We just tryna learn a word and keep from getting murdered
We be on that Kirk and Kendrick Sunday after service
You can call it worship, Tamir Rice done got us nervous
Innocent and killed like Christ is how they hurt us
But I'm here for that
Probably ain't gonna get a lot of cheers for that

I just do it for the love, I do it for the love (I do it)
I do it for the broke and the poor, those all feel ignored
I'm here for that
Tell 'em we woke and we alert now
I promise there's healing for your hurt now
Yeah, tell 'em we came to put in work now
Yeah, can I get a amen from the church now?

Love over hate, love over hate
I'm here for that
Real over fake, real over fake

For my sisters who be fighting for that justice, uh, I'm here for that
Real fathers, loving on they wives and kids, I'm here for that
My wife is classy but a little ratchet, yeah I'm here for that
West coast feeling but I still live in the A homeboy, I'm here for that
When I walk on the courthouse judge feel the case out, definitely here for that
Y'know when that unexpected check comes in the mail, 'cause, I'm here for that
Always here for that
Uh, always I'm here for that
Gotta love it, gotta love it, gotta love it, gotta love it

It means to be broadened, y'know, beyond the understanding that black women are strong
Body and souls and so we're not only strong, we are, we are helpers
We are lovers, we are fighters, y'know, we, we love strong
But we are also human, y'know that mean's we are vulnerable
Y'know we are, we hurt, y'know we ache, like everybody else
We need somebody, to, to be strong for us when we are taking the bumps
The bruises we're here on the frontlines, fighting so many battles 
That many people are not privy to and so I think that
So y'know we are sisters, we are aunts, y'know we are deaconesses
We are leaders in our churches, y'know, we are speakers
We are writers, y'know we are corporate, y'know, CEO board executives
We are advocates, we need our brothers to stand up and defend black womanhood
Don't silence us, y'know, be happy that we are here to enable you, to empower you
But we also need that empowerment to go both ways","Here, 2016",2016

You better watch your mouth
I'd rather pray for forgiveness for what might come out
Lord, have mercy on the words I speak
I'll have an opinion but might change my views next week

But when they share their hate it's called scholarship
And why ain't no Whole Foods in the hood
All I see is fast food here, can we eat good?
We need black-owned, and less bad loans
Less liquor shops and pawn shops and we by gold

We busy being mothers while you chasing platforms
You fat for them you living backwards

Is this Rap or a cry for help?
Because many times, I think that I confuse myself
I'm just small time, but some think I can change rap
They think I'm BET They me to bring the game back
They like Sho, you inspire so many folk
But what is it all for when you're creative and broke
I know, I know, money don't solve problems but
Influence don't stop Sallie Mae from calling
It's enough to drive a brother to depression
I'm rich in spirit but my pocket's in recession
This is [?], I'm only telling you how I feel
Only fake people gotta remind you they keep it real (I keep it real)
I'm fighting my pride trying to be the nice guy
But my Michael Jackson's just trying to see the bright side
My white friends think I'm all about black power

You more precious than a diamond, girl, I see you shine
I ain't insecure, girl, I know you mine
You ain't Oakland, girl, but I call you my ""bae""
When silence is violence, you know what to say
I'm eyeing you (I mean, I mean) you and I
I know it's hard to stay grounded when you know you fly
We can take this to the floor and we can groove
I ain't got nothing to prove, I'll just leave that up to you
Translate your body language every time you move
Even in a crowded room, it's just me and you
We can build a future, build dreams, build children
Man, forget these other women, you Number One in the building

If it wasn't for love, where would I be?
Let me tell you 'bout love, it'll set you free

I used to be scared of the Holy Ghost
Now I'm just scared of them holy folks
Should we disagree with God or should we change Him?
If I'm made in His image, then why do we feel like strangers?
Is He a battery that's charged by my faith?
Who's at fault when I race but then I fall on my face?
Is God to blame for our intentions?
Like scientists didn't bless the world with eugenics
Like media ain't teachin' a new religion
Every time I watch the news, I'm gettin' a baptism
Should I prophesy or should I proselytize?
Is it culture engagement or compromise?
When I keep the doors closed, I'm gettin' ostracized
But when I open up the doors, I'm gettin' colonized
Everything is straight when you have no moral compass
Everything is new when you thinkin' like Christopher Columbus
Is everything just a social construct?
Who's allowed to judge our moral conduct?
I was an insecure boy who just thought he was a genius
But always pissed off, that's because I thought with my penis
It's all strategic, I'm just asking us the reason
Share my faith on the track, I'm just exorcising demons

Okay, let me preach

The rich man wants more
The poor man wants your's
The oppressed want a peace of mind
The thief want a piece of mine
The doubter needs a little faith
It ain't cliché to say ""let us pray""
Who gon' call the fouls if everyone balls out?
So open-minded that your brain falls out
G.K. said it best, nothing fails like success
And being consumed with it is much worse than death
They killin' you with money, they just bought your silence
You can't worship in a land full of pirates
The more booty, I promise the more scary
Success can be a drag, you can ask Tyler Perry
We sell sex then get mad that we have rapists
We promote greed then get mad that we have haters
I hated the police until a brother got robbed
I hated welfare until a brother lost his job
When I'm at work, I watch my pockets for them corporate thugs
When I'm at home, I watch my back for those crips and bloods
If my words bring conviction, let's call in context
I'm realizin' life is pretty complex
Thoughts of abortion taught me sanctity of life
A divorced man and woman taught me how to love my wife
A poor man sat me down and taught me about dignity
A blind man's vision taught me all about imagery
It'll leave you broke, that's why it's called the record industry
I forgot who I am, trying to get them to remember me
We adapt and evolve, the problems just revolve
Industry creates the very problems that they try to solve
I know I trace my image way back to the beginning
We done lost so much, we don't know when we winning
I'm hated, I'm loved, I'm both, I'm a challenge
I'm clean, I'm redeemed, I'm a recovering addict
I have baggage, I am damaged, I am unequally balanced
I'm a servant, but I have a room in the palace
Uh, never told a lie
Uh, never told a lie

Sho Baraka,"Ya'll ready? Ok, Marty, we ready!
Let's put it in the red

I lost it, I lost it a long time ago
I died already, I got one life to go
Executives, they put us on the shelf, they say we counterfeit
I got the answers but they don't know what the problem is
I fight the power but they want me to dance
I do the right thing cause I ain't Rosie Perez
I'm praying ""Lord, can you change my position?""
As if my position can make for an easy mission
I get possessions, they tell me to set 'em free
I cancelled, does that mean my possessions they own me?

I wanna be a activist, but I don't wanna get shot

I get lost in my own head, I'm so amazed
You could choose to be the book or either read about it
You could speak about it, be a prophet or just be a product

A silver tongue, gold pockets
Fat belly, stolen wallets
Empty words, loaned knowledge

I'm undervalued but I can be a prophet
I'm undervalued but I can be a prophet
I'm undervalued but I can be a prophet

Help me find it, I think I'm losing my religion

I told him find somebody outside the church who was innocent
They only throw stones at trees that bear fruits
So don't be shocked when the mob attempts to throw stones at you
The ancestors told us we should wake up
And when I stop dreaming, failure, we gon' break up

Maybe we don't need words to communicate our love
Maybe

All I wanted a perfect life
Some perfect kids and a perfect wife
Some perfect days and some perfect nights
Even though I'm flawed, I should be alright
A child with special needs didn't fit in my plans
I'm a needy man, wanting more that what you put in his hands
All I wanted was a perfect family core
Now I'm envying the family next door
Trying not to trust therapy more than God
I am walking the street where fear and love collide
I am learning in weakness, you still gotta serve
And my connection with my boys is way deeper than words
But damn, words, I thrive with 'em
Words are my life, my career, I survive with 'em
I'm given a life sentence that words can't fix

Yeah maybe words don't say much
Maybe we don't need words to communicate our love

My sons are not a punishment or an accident
Just a little abstract masterpiece of what the master did
I try not to doubt the power of prayer
But sometimes, I just feel like the power ain't there
Some days I'm feeling good, some days I'm feeling torn
I'm getting praise for activities a father should perform
I get applause when I excel, thank you
Is there grace for me when I fail and I'm feeling shameful

Yeah, well maybe words don't say much
Maybe we don't need words to communicate our love

My father said he needed greater trust in the Lord
And the Lord used cancer so he could trust in Him more
He died without complaining, that's when I understood
He taught me more in his silence, that a sermon ever could
Words can be lies to help us disguise our phoniness
Feeling insecure, in the midst of pride and loneliness
I learned the meaning of contentment really fast
Wanting change, while appreciating everything that you have

Yeah maybe words don't say much
Maybe we don't need words to communicate our love
Maybe words don't say much
Maybe I should just learn to shut up

Only you know

Only you know
Only you know
Oh oh oh

Truth is your presence speaks much louder than when a choir sings
I never knew I'll find joy up in the smallest things
The counsellor said ""Live long, love strong, stick together""
This is a thorny rose you two will carry forever
Find value in your interactions, and not in your treasure
Find strength in Jesus, increase your faith in good measure
Avoid evil, your kids need a home that is peaceful
Don't be a passive man, understand that your family needs you
Pray for healing, hoping they find a cause
But after all, I resolved, you are not a problem to solve
Maybe I wouldn't change you
Maybe I'm just unable to see your potential
Because I'm blinded by the labels

Yeah maybe words don't say much
Maybe we don't need words to communicate our love
Maybe words don't say much

Who you wit, or where you at, nigga
Go Crazy, nigga
Go motherfucking Crazy, nigga
Get motherfucking sick wit it!

Sometimes I might get a little Crazy
Dipped and sticking doors with one-eighty
Ever since the G's raised me
The streets couldn't fade me, go Crazy

[Christ Bearer]
Yeah, all why'all niggaz go Crazy
Leave the bitch-ass niggaz braindead in the daily
Too many ho's yelling, ""Christ Bearer, save me!""
Bitches can't swim 'cause the water too wavy
My nigga, get a little nuts
The Wu don't give two fucks, Clan like Klu Klux
Lace the Digi with the 'dro
Tai Bo, bust ya fo'-fo', let ya hair down, ho
Ya gotta get a little sick
Let niggaz try to play you like a step-child and click
Fuck the dumb shit, nigga, trip
Lose ya grip, pull a semi-automatic out the whip
Get psychotic, neurotic, they want it, they got it
Bang it to the boogie, hypnotic
Dip a stick and do a quick one-eighty
Like G's that raised me, a Long Beach baby
Taught me the difference of a bitch and a lady
The streets can't fade me when I'm liable to go Crazy

[Shoshot]
Crazy, like hitting a bank with a three-eighty
And maybe, flip and pistol-whip an old lady
That's shady, ya think that's shady?
Hell, not as shady as the bitch that had my first baby
And maybe, that's why I blow big dope on the daily
And maybe, I'll fuck ten more bitches and have ten more babies
And lately, I've been wanting to take shit back to the eighties
And maybe, I'll drive-by shooting at niggaz that hate me
See baby, you know my story and that's the way it still goes
Real crazy, I'm still rapping baby and I still hate ho's
Shoshot is sick wit it, gots nothing for ho's
but conversation and some dick wit it, can you dig it?
I'm a zipped down fool, and niggaz pause when I spit it
I might strip to my drawers, when I trip off the liquid
See maybe, I need to get fucked up 'til I hurl
'cause I'm Crazy like 2Pac screaming ""Fuck the world!""

[Chorus 2X]
[Christ Bearer]
Yeah, fuck that, go looney
Screaming ""Bitch, sue me"", off the wall like a young Paul Moonie
Break a rule, act a motherfucking fool
Roll a cutty on D's, solo at the carpool
Play Clyde Bearer's like a young Warren Beaty
Let Bonnie be ya lady so the bitch go Crazy

[Meko the Pharaoh]
While niggaz go Crazy I stay amazing
Doing what I do, straight blazing
Re-arranging, the time structure in the streets
Rotating planets like my people far out, you can't see
Believe it or not, a drop
NorthStar make ya heart stop
Too hot.. yeah, my shit stay live.. wit a vibe
that makes niggaz go Crazy when they get high (pass that)
Bitches button down ya button-fly
Niggaz bust ya fo'-five, get real live
'cause ya only live this life once
So bounce to this motherfucker like you own one (bounce)
Dip a stick and straight trip on a nigga
Take a sip and straight spit on a nigga
'cause the streets straight raised me
But they couldn't fade me (nigga), go Crazy

""He's part of some scheme""

Your enemy whispers

So you have to scream

I know about whispers

I see how you look at my sister

Don't

I'm not naive

I have seen women around you
Don't

Think I don't see

How they fall for your charms
All your charms

I'm erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder how Eliza reacted
When you broke her heart
You have thrown it all away
Stand back, watch it burn
Just watch it all burn

And when the time comes

Explain to the children

The pain and embarrassment

You put their mother through

When will you learn

That they are your legacy?
We are your legacy

If you thought you were mine (mine, mine)

It's Thugged Out Entertainment nigga 
Straight like that
We club, shoot, stab, sell crack
Straight like that
We eat, sleep, shit street life
Straight like that
We get knocked by the same ?
Straight like that

We gettin' bitches, bitches, money, money, basically
There ain't no kissin', we just fuckin' honeys, basically
You see why'all snitchin' niggaz talkin' funny, basically
Me and my niggaz is known to keep it ugly, basically


I'm off the ?yelzabob? I walk wit the mac in my sweats
Air forces, wife beater, fitted cap to the left
My chain hang 35 inches, my heat 7 and a quarter
Beard 8 and a third, and my piece be Orca
There's no need for peace offers, my niggas be shootin', we riot
We run the streets quiet, 'cause the law's biased
Skip the battles back in 86, now niggaz tattle, chop crazy bricks
Cop new kicks, quick to say they rich
Fantasize and flatten the hills, for niggaz in ghettos
Its crack, bullets that kill, dreams are fulfilled
Murders, ink in cold blood, holdin' grudges for years
I keep two bitches, two hot biscuits, four dot sixes
The sorrow to swallow, I follow my motto
Squeeze first, since the day I slung, ready rockin' a bottle
I stand and deliver like Edward Olmos, wet whatever
Respect whatever, I talk with a tech forever


Our show's at your service on behalf of Final Chapter
? I'm not a rapper, quick to slap ya
Got scheme, its not a factor, we gotta shine first
Have 'em coppin' your album just for our verse
Straight like that, why'all better tell 'em
I hope they don't act like we won't smack to back of their cerebellum
Oh and did I mention? if I feel tension
Get the full arm extension, get the whole block's attention
I know you keep your life in your cash
Your cash in the stash, stash in the car, car in the lot
So when I blow up the lot ::BOOM:: your whole shit stop
Why'all rappers is backwards, make the game flip flop
I'll take you to the spot with no witnesses and no cops
Better have your glock out and cocked, about to pop
To hustlers like Flynt, sellin' cracks like Sprint
A dime a minute, now roll the dice, five in it

[Chorus: ] 

Aiyyo, aiyyo
I peeped your true colors while why'all niggaz was blinded
I been down and spit a pound before you knew I was rhymin'
You know me, illest flow, ain't no seconds for timing
My sixteens'll rip through beats, cut deeper than diamonds
Make ya niggaz start to worry 'cause my hood is dark and blurry
When shots flurry, niggaz point guard like Marbury
Ain't no arguing, all my click'll do is get the targeting
Final Chapter split pies in two, its half bargaining
I've seen you niggaz come up quick and then fall
I've seen you frontin' for your broad like her pussy's the bomb
Clowns findin' their stash gone but my cash is long
So I'ma let why'all pass on, 'cause you ass like a thong
My click is movin' out, now is you rollin' along?
'Til I perish I'm spittin' strong, it's that shit that I'm on
Final Chapter's comin' at ya, now the drama is born
Settle in this street life from the hoods to the lord

Aiyyo I'm still ghetto, that's why these niggaz love me
I'm still on the run eatin' so I got chubby
I spaz up in the Tunnel, stab niggaz with pens
That's why 'til this day they don't let me in
I be in New York smokin' LA weed
I hate a bitch named Pebbles like LA Reed
I dead niggaz like Pac and Big, blocks to live
These niggaz can't eat like hostages
Fuck Camry's and fuck Honda Accords
I rob niggaz like the Crips at the Source Awards
And everything that went down was cool with me
As long as I came back with my jewelry
We had machine guns, I think we had two or three
And two or three limos, me and my nigga Timbo
For bitches that suck nuts and spit it out the window
You know my tempo, like Bloody Money 3

Throwin extra clips and all that shit
And we gone waste ya
Relissin naked bones up on the pavement

Forty niggas in the black streets
Came out the Cain house
Left a nigga lyin for dead
Screamin one of his hommies names out
I was thirteen rained out
Couldnt see identify
Two keys and fifty G's
And one dead nigga off inside

Smokin bees

Now you back where you begin while I'm livin on ten
Got inns sittin in a Benz wit rims sippin on Hen
Wit Stokes, Twist, and Mayze while you broke bitch I'm paid
Should of stayed but betrayed look at the cheddar you could have made
You started with the mob thought you was harder than the mob
But ain't no one motherfucker larger than this mob
Swear to god, for why'all see-Wall ain't got love
No only one that's gonna be on you side is this hot slug
For the dead and locked I'm throwin my mob up
Cock and bust to all why'all bitches die for crossin us

and always end up fucked watchin other niggaz backs
I broke hamps wit my folks and get pounds

would they really bust rounds?
I get woozie when I inhale all the badness
I swear to the Lord when I was young I never had this problem
I stressed the fuck out gotta doubt my own niggaz
I try to solve my problems wit hamps and liquor
I used to swig a 22, graduated to a 64

Most likely it's the scene of creamery
I'm petrified of the whole scenery

Or give up because the game is quick to make a nigga stroke it

So it came to plannin missions damn near shittin in my drawers

Tryin to scoot out, carry the bloody glock
Cause niggaz they plot, it was a shoot out
Tryin to take the loot out my pocket 
But I'm quick to let the glock spit at his 350 rocket
Then I split runnin down the block 
No sense of dick made them bitch made niggaz whip out a gauge
Then blaze my ribcage, I'm dazed
on the ground hella bleeedin ass out
I remember seein somebody put me in a glass house, I passed out
Then my spirit arose up out my flesh, I'm old
No more bullet holes in my chest
A gold vest when I awaken for Mista Go-Tec-9 is awaitin
The Lord has no love for playa hatin
I'm facin Shock Jesus cause I'm the G-ist nigga to do the job right
Because I'm trained up in that mob life
Come back tonite strapped tonite
He said if I succeed he'll bring my family and dead homies back to life

Flyin through the cuts goin the secret hill route
The whole scene was a disaster
Friday the 13th the final chapter 
Lookin niggaz wit casper the ghost
But I float until I smoked the big man
Slipped in quick sand

Overseas whylin while they profilin on the TV's 

Some of em cool though, see I like that nigga Bill 

Hittin everything in town, and he got that smile down 

Now let's break down the meaning of a smile 

Is it happiness and blissfulness? Well let's go down the list 

You got the ""Real Deal For Real Real"" smile 

You got the ""Phony They Don't Know Me Let Me Have My Feel"" smile 

The ""Dumb embarrassed"" smile 

The ""Oooh She Look Delicious Sure That Girl Is Lavish"" smile 

Then you got the ""Shake Your Head, Naah Black, 

That Shit Was Wack"" smile 

The ""Across The Bar, Yeah It's Cool, 

We Can Hit The Sack"" smile 

The ""Crack"" smile, the ""Caught In The Act"" smile 

The ""Over My Shoulder Caught You Scheamin On Me 

Delayed React"" smile 

The smile you're really glad to see, when it comes round 

The spot's hot, they got you boxed in, it's bout to go down 

You glance back, your man who packs that, once in a while 

gives you the 

""Oh I'm Strapped, Do Your Thing, Baby I Got Your Back"" smile

Smi-ling fa-ces, some-times 

Pre-tend, to be your friend 

Smi-ling fa-ces, show no tra-ces 

of the evil, that lurks within 

Whaddya think I joke? (Nope) 

Whaddya think I sniff coke? (Dope) 

Me a Wild T'ing, like Tone Loc, you betta be go 

When the sound clash erupt, rev up 

Step up to the cut, ""Wassup?"" 

I show up to blow up and leave the spot to' up 

You know what? I'ma go nut 

And you know what? Yeah so what? 

It's the regular, when you check for the 

one that perfected the 

smiling face people posing as your equal 

Knowin they want to beat you defeat you and eat you 

but they greet you with peace and love 

Not with the beast but the dove 

Not beneath but above 

Now the cheek, give a hug, snug 

No grudge, til you turn your back and learn the facts 

It's called learn the truth 

The tree is only known by it's fruits 

These smiling faces, in many places, sometimes they racist 

Sometimes they sexist, sometimes they want your Lexus 

Sometimes they be your family members remember, 

""Oh no not my lady, oh no not my fellow"" 

with them you thought you'd never ever sever 

But they was two-faced and headless 

with a whole 'nother agenda but clever to say whatever 

forever, let me make this relationship better 

If you're real, stay real, be real 

The truth, we got to treasure, not these 

Smi-ling fa-ces, some-times

If you can't take me home with you
Then a lap dance will have to do
If you can't take me home with you..

Anybody got change for twenty?
Mmm, shake it up, shake it up
Yeah, I know it's rough out here, love
But we got your back

[Chorus x2]
Give it up cause she's a man's girl
She's bubbling in a man's world
Give it up cause she's a man's girl
She's struggling in a man's world

[Shock G]
Now tell me, can you tell the difference
Between a fast-tracking, skank-gaming tramp
And a man's girl
Kind of seems the same with just one glance
See, both of them cause erections from afar
But upon closer inspection it becomes clear
Money be	 gonna get you in there

[Money B]
See, a clever girl knows
Not just hoes work them skirts that's mini
Prostitutes that dress this way
Try to imitate most of the uptown bitties
Now we don't really want to speak upon
Those girls who act real slutty
But we will talk about those man's girls
Those are the one we're studying

[Shock G]
She's real secure, pretty toes pedicured
Baby got her own money
She thinks brothers who floss are funny
Ain't afraid to lick that honey off my body
Feminist party issues she don't care about
Understands men well and knows the power of long hair

[Money B]
I doubt
If she'll fall for the type whose pants are tight on
His pookie
Likes her sex fresh and fruity with the light on
That booty

[Chorus]

[Clee]
Oohwee, she popping! Gotta be, got me jocking
Even Nike and Reebok, the girl I'm talking about be rocking
Them pumps with the toes out
Super saucy when we go out
Or with her patnas, she can blow clout
Cause she's the shit, no doubt
She's so about her scrill, that gives it all the more thrill
Can't lie, a little high
Couldn't get a better ride out of an automobile 
Never make it hard to go chill
Let me do my thing, let a brother breathe
But she make it so convenient when she around
I don't ever want to leave

[Shock G]
She's never stressing who
What I'm gon' do, how I've been riding with my crew
She says play on, ain't nothing wrong
As long as eventually I come home
(Money B: Ooh, she cool) When a brother finally do
The joke's on me cause she's gone
Taking care of she instead of worrying about me
(Money B: For shee?) For sheezy, she pleases me
Knowing that I got her back with what's important
Knowing that I'm down and when I clown with my homies
It's a necessity Â­ she gets to me, yes, I confess it
Secure with her intellect
Never afraid of flexing them hoe-ish dresses

[Money B]
Sex appeal drapes her whole vicinity
I'm worked on, those girls that want to get they lurk on
They get into me

Where you going, love
(Can I be down?) Can I be around?

Come on, now
Get up on the table, baby, get on the table
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about
Can I hit that puna? Punana, punana
[Chorus x2]
[Shock G]
And I appreciate it too, love
I love them shoes, love that dress
I love the whole program
I know you can't keep it up everyday
But when you do I'm loving it, just like that
Now take 'em off
You deserve a foot massage
And I'm about to give it you..
Can I get that puna? Punana, punana
Somebody give me change for a twenty
And get up on the table
Oh no, I ain't giving you more than a dollar

Shockwave,"I won't fall in line - 
You said by this time I'd be a slave to the world 
But I'm resisting and I'm changing all the things I have known 
Never looking back on the battles that I've lost or won 

I'm bruised and barely breathe 
I won't fall in line 
You know I won't turn away from you at all 
I'll look you straight in the eye 
This one thing 

This frenzy burns inside me 
This one thing will not die 
It will never die - chemical rebellion 
Rebellion towards what you fight 

You fight mortality and lose 
You've always told me that I'm going down 
But I'm still here 
Staring straight into your face 

I'm going to make it
Fist over fist 
I'm bruised and barely breathe 
It will never die",Frenzy,2001
Shockwave,When it generates like this when it opens holes and gouges undignified lines when it reaches deeper than I ever thought it could when it resounds like pealing bells when it shakes the groud I barely crawled on when it shocks when it seethes when it bleeds and scabs and rubs when it's infected it has a name and that name burns it's more than a wound it carries a name when its raw when it's real when it breathes and lives it claws and rips and breaks it has a name and that name burns for nothing.,Revenge,2001
Shockwave,"An open letter to the fat, arrogant, anti-charismatic
National embarrassment known as President John Adams
Shit!

The man's irrational, he claims that I'm in league
With Britain in some vast international intrigue
Trick, please!
You wouldn't know what I'm doin'
You're always goin' berserk
But you never show up to work
Give my regards to Abigail
Next time you write about my lack of moral compass
At least I do my job up in this rumpus

Oh

The line is behind me, I crossed it again
While the president lost it again
Aw, such a rough life
Better run, tell your wife
""Yo, the boss is in Boston again""
Let me ask you a question who sits
At your desk when you're in Massachusetts?
They were calling you a dick back in '76
And you really haven't done anything new since
You're a nuisance with no sense
You'll die of irrelevance
Go ahead, you aspire to my level
You inspire to malevolence
Say hi to the Jeffersons!
And the spies all around me
Maybe they can confirm
I don't care if I kill my career with this letter
I'm confining you to one term
Sit down, John, you fat motherfucker!

Shoddy,"J'en ai plus rien à foutre
Done deal le shit est set
J'vais aller jusqu'au bout
la tête droite et les yeux secs
Plus rien ne peut m'arrêter
Pas même ma mom ou mon father
Pas même babyluv ou ma soeur
LS ou Raf le manager
Pour de vrai j'm'en crisse
Focus sur l'objectif
J'me sens comme dans l'autobus
avant de détonner l'explosif
Si c'est moi contre le bunch
alors le bunch a un problème
Je persévère jusqu'à la fin
Abandonner est peu probable
Et même si je die
le message vit encore
Porte le à bout de bras
Affiche le haut comme Viacom
Si tu t'opposes t'es un obstacle
Que je contourne ou je surmonte
Tu ne le feras qu'une fois
One time comme juste une montre
Je viens laisser ma marque
Indélébile la scarlatine
Rien à foutre de ma life
Imagine donc c'que vaut la tienne
En paix avec  moi-même
Est-ce que tu peux en dire autant?
C'est l'ascension vers Heaven
ou bien descends rôtir longtemps

Nothing's gonna stop me
Rien ne pourra m'arrêter de milliter, manifester pour l'égalité
Sans cesse harcelé par les cops, me
Intimidé, médiatisé, humilié par la société
Mais je persévère avec mon hip hop, me
Pour répliquer, m'expliquer, m'exprimer 
En guerre contre l'humanité
Nothing, nothing's gonna stop me no
Nothing's gonna stop me no

J'ai les sentiments d'une pierre
et une volonté de glace
C'est encré dans mon être
Deep down d'au moins 20 brasses
Esprit volatile
N'essaie pas de jouer les émotions
Car j'aurai zéro pitié
pour quiconque veut léser mon son
Je vais aiguiser mes ongles
T'arracher le cœur de la poitrine
L'âme teintée par la peur
Tu portes l'odeur de la latrine
Ne laisse rien ni personne
Se mettre en toi et ta mission
Surtout toi car tout s'écroule
Si tu gères mal tes ambitions
Si à la base tu sais 
à quoi ressemble ton pire ennemie
Tu traverseras l'impossible
comme Hannibal au Pyrénée
Mais aussi réalise
tu es ton plus grand allié
Soit une force indéfectible
quand sortent les armes du râtelier
Ce peut-il être si simple?
Can it be so simple?
Une révélation soudaine
comme la vécu Saint-Paul
Ce peut-il être si simple?
Can it be so simple?
Une révolution humaine
C'est la Vie qui s'impose

Refrain

Je me sens comme une star déchue
sans cesse descendu par les paparazz
Devant la foule crucifié comme Jésus 
Battu par Barabas
J'ai presque plus de carapace
devant tous ces préjudices
Ils ont pendu ma carcasse
devant le palais de justice
Depuis tout jeune, la popo
veut me radier 
Ils se sont moqués de mes propos
dans les radios
Ma tête est coupée, accrochée sur un pic 
devant le parlement
Ils font la fête tous ces flics
Chaque fois que les journaux de moi parlent mal
J'ai  perdu mon permis, mes autos,
ma compagnie, mon condo
Depuis 2005 mon album est repoussé
Ils sont sans cesse sur mon dos
Font annuler mes shows
en appelant les promoteurs
Leurs disent que je suis trop chaud
Un gars de gang d'être relié au motards
Mais j'aimerais savoir
quelle est ma couleur, mon territoire
Je suis ni bleu, ni rouge
ici c'est déjà assez dur d'être Noir
Plus rien ne peut m'atteindre 
Mon cerveau est braindead
J'ai purgé ma peine
mais pour eux je reste prisonnier du système",Rien Ne Peut Nous Arrêter,2010
Shoe Lace,"[3] - I'm going to vauco in my black seville
I follow two my behind a truck with half a mil
I make my first stop at my homeboys ranch 
I ask him ""what's in the bag"" he says ""two acres of plants
It's easy going in but hell gettin out
I want to make this paper and I think I know how
surprise surprise I done made it back home
in an ice cream truck ""who want to buy a snow cone""
  
Hook - repeat 2X

I'm going to the valley
Vauco the valley
I'm goin to the valley what you think fo
  
[4] - From Texas to Cali we get our ye from the valley
We be hustlin on blocks moving in and out the alley
We call it medicine that's what you need when you get sick
Sometimes it's hard rock sometimes it's white pearl brick
Across, across the state line just me and my girlfriend
From powder to pine I got money on my mind
Stop wasting all my time and get me over to the spot
Unload all the cargo and meet me at the docks
  
[5] - Going back to the valley staying on top of my game
Meeting up wit my bitches snow white and mary jane
Only thing that ever mattered to me 
Stacking dollars shit we making a week
Who the cowards who the killas who's the niggas wit scrilla
Felt all up in they pockets rocking fo' niggas that try to kill us
Then maybe later you bitches bother me 
You wanted to pay you too late don't bother calling me
  
[6] - Going to the valley fo' soldiers in a caddy 
And in the back of the caddy got fifty pound of smally
Tryed to jack but can't catch me
I just keep that paper stacking
Always packin never slacking 
leaving you hoe ass niggas unhappy
Chopping burs when able, fucking hoes on the table
Watching cable in a Sable, Dope House is the label
Selling em three for ten to my closest friends
Rolling back to H-towm big body Benz
  
hook
  
[7] - Houston Texas cowboy wit a dime and a fiesta saddle
And I'm moving mo weight then a whole herd of cattle
I grip up the grain blowing up the panhandle
mobile phone on scramble cause rap hustlin is a gamble
Brick moving these H dudes gonna keep you grooving pursuing
Shit, hell on my surella ice water lyrical good fella
SPM got the hook up, say watch out 
I hit the highway, let twenkies crawl
I'm going to the valley
  
[8] - Man I'm flipping up to Mexico to hit some licks
In a Navigator bus bringing back some bricks
Get to checkpoint now I'm past the border
tell my guy alemar to play some more
Fat money cause we in the mix
I got that white girl and that stinky bitch
Better ryders and roamers can't really ask 
""We going out T?"" ""Bitch I'm headed to the valley
So I'm out about to make some money
Pull up to a trailor wit about 800
Unload it I flip it get paid let's ride
Chunk a deuce to the guys and I'm back to Southside
Cruisin wit a couple of pines
Trying hard as hell to make it back to H-Town
Flippin but only make one stop
Then I'm buring out moving shit to a dope house
  
[9] - Cruisin to the valley checking up on me campos
Make thirty calls so I can wire free samples
Get me a plane so I can make my drops
Flying real low to avoid the cops
Weighing my weed on a digital beam
Wrapping it in a plastic quick so I can make my green
My windows are tinted so nobody sees in it
Wit mary jane and snow white the sky's the limit
  
Hook

[10] - My package is small, stack em in the entire wall
Fuck the chotha must be loca
Everything a nigga want make it to the border wit the motha
Pockets rising better quit sizing me up
But these coffe beans fucking the smell up
What's up, back in the city 
de bull lada I'm talking pronto
Call me the head honcho start a new revloution
like a back poncho 
He yah see yah wouldn't want to be yah
Gots to flee, start the G
Switch the ride I'm headed back to the valley
  
[11] - Get um up hit em up
They want to know what it is all about
They way that we roll down south
Start baby wit dope house josie wells gonna 
there ain't nuthin funna then being and outlaw runna 
stunna pimpin in a humma millennium smuggler
Dope game juggla, no nuts no glory
Real mobsters, they never worry
but we ain't home yet so don't get happy
we ain't paid Officer O'Malley
Thinking of my profits going to the valley 
It's all cavi
  
[12] - I'm flipping to the valley federalies
Fucking wit michael decodie motorcycles
?? cruises my disciples 
I'm the type to crew smoke two and synas
wit my G's I'll hunt you 
like Arnold hunts Sarah Connors
Primadonnas big tymers, playa, and rob reports
benz sports,courts, naked hoes, lascivious resorts
I get short my last resort tell L
to keep the Cali cause little down wit his essays 
parlaying down in the valley
  
Hook
  
[13] - I'm a creep 59
to the end of the rainbow land of the llello
Dope fiends on my payroll, got rocks to blow
behind the stop and go they holla 
goodness graious great balls of snow
Don't speed or trip when you see the lights
cause they can tell you're nervous just by looking in your eyes
in H-Town the business in booming
but it won't last long if you don't know what you're doing
  
[14] - Yeundo pal el valle in a nice Expedition
Got me creepin for mi ruka and my boys blowing swishas
Mcallen brownsville harlingen
six hour trip to get my endz
I'm out to get my Benz
on the lean coming clean
lean man flashing green
el meadow meadow meadow
???
thendo vact is none stop
daily stackes to the top
???
keep my hoes by the flock
  
[15] - Who rides like me come wrapped that tightly
L be's moving by the ton
Packed up in tanks under the trunk, 59 to 77 
Collecting my lot not even sweating, back on 35
wit my cheeder just gettin mine
You know me your boy O-Z
Never left lonely wit out my G see
One trip cocks a flip 
The way I flip multiplies a chip
I'm steady ?? cash flow
Transactions stacking paper rolls
The currency connect from Houston to the valley

How can I, keep loving you endlessly
How can we be so far out of reach

All I need to know (need to know that the world)
That the world is nuts snap my fingers (fingers) and
Everything is fine

Sitting looking in the mirror like Alice
Through the looking glass
Life's a never ending journey be careful not to go too fast
Sometimes I can't help myself from falling in too deep
I know it may be hard to tell your love is calling me

Take control of my destiny I know it's just a matter of time
That I will find that midas touch

I will lay my hair down for you a thousand times to show you
That when you reach me at the top
I'm gonna give you all I got
And wherever we go our hearts will follow

It's a UK thing, stuff that we bring
No one to burn, let the journey begin
We're the Mis-teeq, we're in chorus we sing
Quick off the mark, ring a ding ding ding
In a mix with a bag of tricks
Feel the vibe with the one sun-ship
Move to the beat it's about music
Roll through these tracks with fresh tactics

Body-guarded, heart in bits 
A blue-eyed honesty 
Indigo injury 
The family tree is felled 
Bereavement worn so well 
Giving up on certainty 
Wilderness society 

Wearing the fame like a loaded gun 
Tied up with a rosary 
I'm glad I'm not a Kennedy 

Imagine being a Kennedy 
Rule without remedy 
To watch your family die 
The world loves a sacrifice 
Prophets longing for the three 
Honoring the tragedy 
They hunger for the crime 
The privilege to take a life 

Wearing the fame like a loaded gun 
Tied up with a rosary 
Ooh, I'm glad I'm not a Kennedy 

And is not peace basically 
A matter of human rights? 
The right to live out our lives 
Without fear of devastation? 
The right to breathe air 
As nature provided it? 
The right of future generations 
To a healthy existence? 
Let us if we can step back from 
The shadows of war and seek out 
The way of peace

I love the look in your eyes 
I can see your soul sometimes and we laugh 
When we try too hard we stop and start

The cost of freedom is always high, 
Yet one path we shall never choose 
That is the path of surrender or submission.

The scriptures tell us, 
He maketh even his enemies 
To be at peace with him'.

Risk the course of worldwide nuclear war

Would be ashes in our mouths

Ashes in our mouths

Keep it locked away 
For some future rainy day.

Spin before my view, 
Like some toy kaleidoscope 
Images of you.

On fleeting lovers 
They can turn the briefest hour 
Into a day 
Turn a moment 
To a lifetime 
Making it to last 
Blending future with the past.

I shall save it

Let daylight dry your tears;

To guard you and to guide you.

Turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always;
Promise me that all you say is true,
That's all I ask of you.

Let me be your shelter,
Let me be your light;
You're safe, no one will find you,
Your fears are far behind you.

All I want is freedom,
A world with no more night;
And you, always beside me,
To hold me and to hide me.

Let me lead you from your solitude.
Say you need me with you, here beside you,
Anywhere you go, let me go too,

 Would curl upwards like the wild sea
 A special friend knowing all the ways of love
 Would talk his way back inside a tiny second

 One in a thousand (maybe even me)

 Sooner or later eveyone'll say the same thing

 That all I want is to be with you
 Call me over sooner
 Call me right now
 I'm standing underneath the blackest rolling sky
 I don't know my way forward
 I'm dizzy with the wind
 Turning like a compass never true only spinning
 All I want is to be with you
 In the sad and lonely pines
 Where no midday sun ever shines
 As the clouds all float into thin air
 Underneath the blackest sky somewhere
 I hear the soul of man never dies
 I hear that special will survive
 Keeping time over the rolling roads
 Staying with me as my thoughts all go
 Chasing away in the green fields
 Where every breath gives up and yields
 To all I want",All I Want,2004

Out of the confusion
The static and the noise you got my attention
It made me want to live

Live its the last moon rising
Scream just like none is there
Lose all of my defenses
Hold you touch you love you like its
The very last moment in time

It seems like I woke up beneath a different sky
And I'm drunk on what I'm seeing through these open eyes
All the little ways you move me
All the pieces you expose
The illusion I held on to
You've got me letting go

I just want to stay here soaking up the rain
Falling all around me wash the world away

Let me feel you next to me
Let me taste the breath you breathe
Open up the space between us

Shonen Knife,"Raindrops keep falling on my head 
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed 
Nothin' seems to fit 
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling 

So I just did me some talkin' to the sun 
And I said I didn't like the way he' got things done 
Sleepin' on the job 
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling 

But there's one thing I know 
The blues he sends to meet me won't defeat me 
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me 

Raindrops keep falling on my head 
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red 
Crying's not for me 
Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin' 
Because I'm free 
Nothing's worrying me.",Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head,1998

Shonie,"I wanna take this time out from rapping right now
(oh oh) and share something really personal to the world 
(oh oh yeah) 

I wanna dedicate this to my baby (yeah)
Since I know that he listening 
I'm gone always be yo girl
(oh oh ooh)

See maybe y'all never been in love like I've been
In love and maybe you've never felt the things that I've felt (oh oh)
See I've never had this tingle inside from a man 
Feels like he makes my heart melt 
I mean the way that he looks at me is a look 
I've never got from another brother 
He's cool, got swag, calm, collective, and you know
What else he's a damn good lover 
See he knows what it takes to keep up on my face
And he knows when I'm feeling unconvertable 
And our relationship is out of place
The taste of his lips the swag in his walk 
How he so disciplined ambitious and the way that he talks a Capricorn 

Hm hm hm stole my heart and I don't even want it back
He can have it, he can have it, he can have it, he can have it
Cause he got it like that 

(he can have it baby, he can have it, oh yeah he can have it)
So independent, focused, 
And he knows how to love yes 
Who would of dreamed in a million years
It would be you I'd be speaking of the tent sign of a zodiac 
One of the most serious and stable, reliable, responsible,
And the characteristic that I like most is ladies 
He always ready, willing, 
And able now when God created him 
I know he had to be in good mood 
Because my man gives me the up-most respect

And ladies he's never disrespectful and he's never rude
Loving, caring, and giving he's all of the above I just want to say
'Thank You God for giving me all I've been dreaming of'
I feel like Cinderella when she found her prince
I can remember I was looking for love but I ain't been looking since
My Capricorn, my Capricorn, my Cap-ri-corn

So sexy his charm, his motivation, his patience, 
All combine together as one man, my man
Strong, but careful of every move that he make 
All the steps that he takes real not fake
The Capricorn, the Capricorn, the Capricorn, 
That's all I ever needed
All I ever wanted
So I took this time out of my life 
To let you know how I was feeling about my Capricorn
My Capricorn, my Capricorn, Capricorn,
Baby I Love You your love waiting here for you
So where ever you are, 
Whatever station you listening to right now I'm here
Somebody call my Capricorn home for me 
Or better yet I'll do it myself.

We can get loose do-it baby till the crack of dawn,

I've been around the block
I got the keys to the city if the gates are locked
And a freak like me ain't bout to stop
I got a hand full of dreams and a heart full of God

Everywhere we go they wonder where we're from
Well its diverse city ya'll welcome to come
It sits high on a hill you can see it for days
And even if you can't you can hear our praise
We go

'Cause we're boomin' out the stereo system
This goes out to anyone listening
Boomin' out the stereo system
Here to rep the most high with this one
Boomin' out the stereo system

This goes out to anyone listening
Boomin' out the stereo system
'Cause we rock for sure in stereo

If you're looking to slide, come slide with us
And if you're looking for a ride, it's a big old bus
We got black folk, white folk and Middle East
Mexican, Filipino - Jesus Freaks
Got a Haitian Princess, an Aussie Mate
East Coast, Midwest to left side of the states
And when the bus rolls, it's out the dirty south
Tennessee and we keepin' it good and loud we go

Portable sounds to take me higher
Portable sounds to lift me up

Broken in, stumbling, you still have a friend, a friend
I'm reaching out, dark clouds get out of the way
Today's the day, it's OK, remember what you've prayed

We walk on water
Don't you let go, don't you let go
When it gets harder
We get back, get back up and do it again
Don't you let go, don't you let go
When it gets harder
We get back, get back up and do it again

You standing out on the edge, don't know how to begin
You never know if you don't go, just embrace the wind
The oceans roar and the shore seems far away
The path is laid, come with me, they'll just have to obey

We walk on water
Don't you let go, don't you let go
When it gets harder
We get back, get back up and do it again
Don't you let go, don't you let go
When it gets harder
We get back, get back up and do it again

No longer sinking
I can see the surface now
No longer sinking
I can see it, I can see it
I can see it, I can see it
I can see it, I can see it
I can see it, I can see it

We get back, get back up and do it again

Don't you let go, don't you let go

Seven of us crammed into that truck of mine
Paying no attention to them highway signs
Doing ninety miles an hour toward the county line
Quick sack, twelve pack, back again
It's a B double E double, are you N.

My buddies and their babies letting down their hair
As long as we're together it don't matter where
Ain't got a lot of money but we just don't care
Knowing half the fun is getting there
Aztec, long-necks, paychecks spent
oh, it's a B double E double, are you N.

I can't stop thinking 
What the hell they were drinking 
When they made this county dry
I got a week long thirst 
And to make it worse
Lord, it's my turn to drive

Laughing and a bragging and a carrying on
We loaded up the wagons and we headed home
I guess a half a dozen cases doesn't last that long
Come tomorrow morning it'll be all gone
Then, it's turn around, leave town, sounds again 
Like a B double E double, are you N.",Beer Run,2006

Without you

And frozen tears fall from my eyes
Like icicles in mid-July

Gonna run yourself like you do the ground
You're not invincible and the fact is
Nothing's guaranteed but the darn taxes?

Enough lies will be told, with each day the truth will unfold
Picture if you can, a mountain so high that you can't see the top
An ocean so wide, you can see where it meets the sky
Well that's how far you're gonna have to go
Hold on tight shorty don't let go
Those rains will fall and those winds will blow
Out in those streets it can be so cold

Each river you cross, filled with the unknown not so treasureous
All envy and greed, Will rip you apart and leave you to bleed

Enough backstabbers and informers
Hate and disease so let me warn ya
Sharks in the ocean will raise their teeth

Don't you know I love you",I Crave You,2008
Shontelle,"[Chorus]
Life is not an easy road
A true you just a struggle with your heavy load
I know
It seems it seems you lose the battle more and more
Life is not an easy road
You have to play your part and take control
Don't you ever ease up
Never give up
Don't let go

Hopeless youths them out inna the street
And them no have no job so just to win they have to cheat
Tell me why so many see it and don't speak
And why they'll never find a peaceful home they cyaan retreat
And them cyaan find no food to eat
And where you lay your head them have a bed of concrete
And your momma she ah cry when she ah see it
It's not a revolution just a cycle that repeats cause

[Chorus]

See the sunshine will come one day
And prejudice and inequality will fade away
Man will not judge man but he will say
It's time to love my neighbor as my brother and not hate
And the world will unite as one
And governments eliminate all chemicals and bombs
We will no longer have to run
The uprising has only just begun, so hear me song

[Chorus]

You see them little youth a cry them have cold cold feet
Dem prostitute them life them ah so them world get defeat
Dem politicians try fi take your life you see
But just trust you will survive and keep your dignity
Never mind how them a treat you never mind what them a say
Keep you eyes pon tomorrow but you live for today
You stop you drop you roll to save your soul
You never let them take it away
Sing

[Chorus]",Life Is Not an Easy Road,2008
Shontelle,"Carry me home away from all these things
That keep deceiving me
I'm all alone nowhere no one
To show me where to go
Take my money wear my shirt
Using me to do your dirt
Judging me when all the time
You're the one that did the crime
Someone tell me what's the truth
Save the children, save the youth
What about our hopes and dreams
You're not what you really seem oh

Nation of the plastic people
Here's the church and here's its people
Preaching good and doing evil
Trying to treat you less than equal
Saying this and meaning that
Twisting up into your back
Don't be cast into the sequel
Living in a nation of plastic people (plastic people)

[Verse 2]
You're just like a rose I wanna grow
So I can serve my purpose here
I wanna fly before I die
Be like a bird and touch the sky
Take my home, and take my name
Generation cellophane
There's no difference all the same
I don't know when I'm ashamed
Can you walk inside my shoes?
Don't be mad if I refuse
Artificial attributes,
Different leaders same old news

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
What do you know,
It's a situation begging for salvation
Looking to the sky to answer to all my frustration
There's a choice I'm making
And there's a chance I'll take it
It's the only life I got to live so I can't fake it
Yeah

Shontelle,"When I, was young, and the light, had only begun;
To shine, down on me, I've been blind, now I've started to see

I don't have to be right
There's no power in empty passion
Lots it takes for the fight
Find the strength to be out of passion
Everybody knows me
You're the one who won't hear my story
Give it to ya for free
You're the man who won't share my glory

Sing it out
Play it out

Meet some thin
So I can love again
Shout it out

Tell the whole world the spell is broken
Break these chains
I'm only human

[Bridge: x2]
No superwoman
I'm only human

Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did
And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible

Falling for betrayal is worst
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear

There is nothing to say

Feels like I'm standing on the outside looking in
At the mess we left behind
And it's a long way to fall
I gave you everything I had
I gave it all
And then my heart was on the line

I can't hate you
Any longer
I know I'm going to miss you
I'll forget it and let it go.

Say hello to goodbye, 'cause its gone forever
No more try, you and I
Not now, not ever
And I get by without you
I'm not going back again
I'm not going to lie to you
'Cause, that was there and only then.

Say hello to goodbye
Say hello

And this is how it has to be
'Cause its a deadly combination, you and me
You know its undeniable
Even though we tried it all
We brought the worst out in each other
I recall
We can't act it anymore

What doesn't kill you
It makes you stronger
And though I'm going to miss you
I'll forget it and let it go

Say hello to good-bye
Its gone forever
No more try, you and I
Not now, not ever
And I get by without you
I'm not going back again
I'm not going to lie to you
'Cause, that was there and only then.

Say hello to goodbye
Say hello

And even though the tears will dry
I can't completely disconnect
Couldn't make the compromise
Didn't have a safety net

Say hello to goodbye
Heeey ya ya

Say hello, goodbye

Say hello to good-bye
Its gone forever
No more try, you and I
Not now, not ever
And I'll survive without you
I'm not going back again
I'm not going to lie to you
'Cause, that was there and only then.

With one from Redman  and uhh  it's about uhh 
Well ooh ohh ahh ahh he's gon'  let the monkey out 

Ha Chi Town in it

Now first of all I be the Doc smokin' blocks of hash 
Alert your fag ass commissioner when I harass because 
Hood regulation is, no infiltration 
If it's hot to your crew, then it's hot to the next patient 
I'm in The Bricks like backspins on the mix 
I'm not a playa, but y'all hatin' me like I'm a pimp 
These cars y'all talk about, the Doc already whipped 
You bout to go downtown bitch, like Tha Shiznit 
Overseas bangin' cot in the parkin' lot 
I'm overdosin' in a Amsterdam coffee shop 
And when you lust for hardcore music to bust 
Trust that nigga who bubble mo' than Alka-Seltzer Cold Plus

Bitch you better hit the forty, fuck a margarita! 
Shit I still scam change out the parkin' meter 
And get a bunch of pussies wet overfloodin' peanuts 
Yes, smoke a quarter-sacks, hut one two 
My cerebral will keep the white boys sniffin' glue 
Hotter than Champagne Rump Shaker Part II 
Get dap like the Mad Rapper, ""Who da fuck are you?"" 
The Loaded Desperado, I'm cooler than Rollo 
(Aiyyo, what you hittin' Doc?) I'm hittin' hoes up in the Tahoe 
Gettin' chickens fightin' in the back of the Apollo 
Say, ""Fuck dat!"" if I'm a tough act to follow 
(""Fuck dat!!!"") Disagree I bring the beef gyro 
Only right I spiral the hot shit that I know 

Then buy a six shot Eclipse with plastic grips 

And get a gangsta bitch who love robbin' shit!

I can't hang with pussy niggaz who be scared as hell to push up

I got toys that deploy, I just aim and destroy
I keeps it gully in a bonafide skully
I ain't never had a hit but still get props like Nelly
I'm platinum in streets I got, love in the streets
And I'm more underground than your, basement concrete
Braids in my hair, gold still in my teeth

Kids wild wave at you and smile you feel large
like they cut, and you got the power to heal scars
Never down cause the underground crown is still large
See I rap for a livin, probably rap 'til I die
If you dope, where you been at? Your raps is a lie
I'm all real, the one, the raw deal
Do tour, come home, do a flick for four mill'
What the hardcore heads on the block would call ill
Never catch me at the ball-out spot with small bills
Innovative rapper, rhyme in new ways
When I spit niggaz cough up blood for two days
Never catch me with material girls, they fugaz'
Rather bounce with a short chickenhead in blue shades
'Til the day I'm rich like Bruce Wayne
I'ma kick raps like pimps blew game
Ridin through your block with six new chains on
Pullin over droppin H-bombs
No doubt I got it locked Sanford Ave. to Penn Station
Chancellor to Central a thousand men waitin

You heard me light the Dutch (smokin weed)

Fuckin with me is a close call out of my crew
Don't try it I fuckin roast why'all, you and your co-stars
Next up to bat, I done had enough of cats
Blast tracks like what the fuck was that?
Roz spit rawness
State to state, hood streets and block corners
Rhymes hold so much weight, the feds on us
Lot of niggaz didn't want to see me last
But I won't stop just slow down like Easy Pass
Back up and give the are room
Or we gon' brawl worse than cartoons in bar rooms
In my city they don't pop they collar
Cats that do, get shot drop and holla
I'm from the be	-are-I, see-K-S
And my, squad is hot, any beef they bless
Any, squad that test gon' meet they death
Ask yourself, do you really need that stress?

[Shooga Bear]
Aiyyo, I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door, no bitin allowed
Plus the blows that I throw bring a light in the sound
So whoever want the drama I'm invitin them now
Phenomenal shit, spit 'til my abdominal split
Plus combined lines so minds demolish a click
Still burn MC's like Everclear, never fear
With razor sharp skills so ill they, sever ears
Hard to the roots a hundred proof with no chaser
Scarves and some boots a hundred troops with chrome bangers
Now rock with me, I spray blocks with glock fifties
Still when I spit I flip like Spock sent me
And never gave a fuck what a rapper grossed
But if they, brag and boast I'ma clap the toast
why'all can analyze this, watch me paralyze clicks
And sabotage why'all, I ain't a fan of why'all shit

I'm a nasty ass disease, and now I got ya mouth celibate
I'm a direct descendant of Hannibal's elephants

It's Double O again, still runnin, still gunnin
It's like I got a cast-iron dick, I'm still cummin
Talkin that killer shit like you blood raw
And ain't even did ten minutes in the back of a squad car
Be big niggaz to they weak, I'm true to the streets
why'all niggaz is half-assed like one booty cheek
I'm (??), why'all is Swiss Miss
My camp'll make your army pull back like a slipped disc
It be the Bricks again, with me with them steel rods
It ain't right unless Shane, Tariq, and Raouf Nayim is involved
I did ery'thang from robberies to dope
And why'all just lie about it, like it's a big-ass joke
Playin like kids, I think you want me to spank you
Ninety-nine on the charts with a ship anchor on your ankle
And if you niggaz don't like what I say
I'm in Newark on Market and Hasley e'ry fuckin day

We left L.A. on Sunday, in Lubbock by Tuesday 
That's where we played our second show 
Where nobody knew us, so nobody noticed the songs that the band didn't know 
We were eatin' up the white lines, makin' good time 
Diggin' the songs on the radio 
And that party kept a movin' and you know what we were doin' 
We were smokin' up that California gold 

Now everyone was glad, ""The Weight"" played by The Band 
You know I never had that song ever let me down 
And I didn't notice I was speedin' but in the rear-view mirror blinkin' 
Were them state trooper's lights all spinnin' 'round 
We rolled down the windows, so we didn't think that he would notice 
Something smellin' funny in that smoke cloud 
And he asked, 'What you boys a-hidin'?' and we were all silent 
'Cause I think he heard us clear and loud 

And we were busted 
Busted in Baylor County 
Busted, busted in Baylor County 
""Oh no, my Weed!"" 
He spread us all along the highway, cuffed us all and turned us away 
And started pokin' round the truck for cake 
And we all stood there high as a kite, and he found it alright 
And don't y'all make light of the number one dope dog in the state 
That mutt found the joint in my pocket that was buried and locked up 
In the back of the trailer underneath the guitars and the piano seat 
And off we went to jail all locked up in a cell 
Charged with possession of that sweet leaf 

And we were busted 
Busted in Baylor County 
Busted, busted in Baylor County 
Now I was still pretty buzzed when they called in the judge 
Who greeted me with a smile and a warm handshake 
And he said, ""I'm so sorry"" 'cause they couldn't un-arrest us 
But that was up to some other official magistrate 
And he said, 'Don't you worry, son, all the charges are gone 
But I've got a few autographs for you to sign.' 
And they sprang us out right quick, so we could get up on the stick 
To Wichita Falls by show time 
To tell 'em
We were busted

But I won't go, I won't go! 
Chitty-chitty bang-bang, and I hit the floor 
Two little piggies bust down my door 
The first little piggy went down 
The second little piggy started poppin' off rounds 
I make a break for the parking lot 
I heard some people talkin' how somebody got shot 
They're never gonna see it my way 
So I break for the truck and headed out on the highway 
I must have got it up to 108 
Before three little piggies headed me off the interstate

You sell your apartment, and I'll shake off my load

And wild horses are cursed with their freedom in mind
And a hunger left burning inside

Nothin' that I could have said could have saved her,
No matter how hard that she tried.

Of somethin' that she's never known.
And open her arms at the smile of a stranger,
Who'll love her and leave her alone.

Shooter Jennings,"I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive

I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around and around and around and around and around

I fly a starship
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again",Highwayman,2012

Shooter Jennings,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

I know no love, my only friend is my steed
No one called family, my ties are severed clean
My mother is the mountain, my father is the stream

If you see me young lady, just turn and walk away
I'll be gone in the morn before you wake

We left L.A. on Sunday, in Lubbock by Tuesday 
That's where we played our second show 
Where nobody knew us, so nobody noticed the songs that the band didn't know 
We were eatin' up the white lines, makin' good time 
Diggin' the songs on the radio 
And that party kept a movin' and you know what we were doin' 
We were smokin' up that California gold 

Now everyone was glad, ""The Weight"" played by The Band 
You know I never had that song ever let me down 
And I didn't notice I was speedin' but in the rear-view mirror blinkin' 
Were them state trooper's lights all spinnin' 'round 
We rolled down the windows, so we didn't think that he would notice 
Something smellin' funny in that smoke cloud 
And he asked, 'What you boys a-hidin'?' and we were all silent 
'Cause I think he heard us clear and loud 

And we were busted 
Busted in Baylor County 
Busted, busted in Baylor County 
""Oh no, my Weed!"" 
He spread us all along the highway, cuffed us all and turned us away 
And started pokin' round the truck for cake 
And we all stood there high as a kite, and he found it alright 
And don't y'all make light of the number one dope dog in the state 
That mutt found the joint in my pocket that was buried and locked up 
In the back of the trailer underneath the guitars and the piano seat 
And off we went to jail all locked up in a cell 
Charged with possession of that sweet leaf 

And we were busted 
Busted in Baylor County 
Busted, busted in Baylor County 
Now I was still pretty buzzed when they called in the judge 
Who greeted me with a smile and a warm handshake 
And he said, ""I'm so sorry"" 'cause they couldn't un-arrest us 
But that was up to some other official magistrate 
And he said, 'Don't you worry, son, all the charges are gone 
But I've got a few autographs for you to sign.' 
And they sprang us out right quick, so we could get up on the stick 
To Wichita Falls by show time 
To tell 'em
We were busted

Dear God
I hope you got the letter, and
I pray you can make it better down here
I don't mean a big reduction in the price of beer
And all the people that you made in your image, I see
Them starving on their feet
Because they don't get enough to eat

Dear God, I am sorry to disturb, but I was wondering
If you and me could have some words, Are you listening?
'Cause down here people's minds are twisting, turning
Yo, I could feel the devil's heat rise, burning
I believe in believing but am I only dreaming
I try to keep the faith, but the faith is so deceiving
I heard you got the reasons, the answers and why
I heard you be the sun when it shining in my eyes
Who am I to judge or question your existence?
They say you're in the skies on a cloud in the distance
Snakes be hissing, making people lose their religion
Resorting to the depths of hell, distorted vision
The anger's never hidden, whole worlds gone mad
Mothers crying, murders multiplying, All is up for grabs
It's so sad We pray that one-day we'll see the glory
Is this heaven or hell
Or is it purgatory, who knows?

Dear God
I'm sorry to disturb you but I feel that I should be heard
Loud and clear. We all need a big reduction in amount of tears
And all the people that you made in your image, I see them fighting
In the streets cause they can't make opinions meet

I chant
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
Now the seasons
Give me the answers, give me questions, give me reasons
To keep striving live
I be directing every action, movement in my section
Every movement second, now that contains possibility
To delve into the realms of buddhahood,
Heaven, Hell, or misery
Now, that's an ugly situation
Some standing ovations
Then ride the tour bus
Haunted by suicidal contemplations
But I know for sure that I will reach my destination
'Cause my foundation's thicker, everywhere I stand is Mecca
Detect the incorrect sects like an inspector
Bring it to your sector, let the truth be known
I never had time for these false spiritual clones
I found my own
My kingdom and my throne
Most roll with a whole lotta back with no bones

Dear God
I don't know if you notice but
Your name is on a lot of quotes in this book
And us crazy humans wrote it, you should take a look
And all the people that you made in your image
Still believing that junk is true
But I know it ain't

It's crazy the world we live in there's no doubting, But Armageddon it ain't coming in thi year 2000. Me, I know 2000 million armies sprouting, spirits arousing, kids from the burbs and public housing. With 10 worlds to dwell from Buddhahood to hell. Miguel Angel, it seems my poppa named me very well. It's necessary that we spread the love to every. If you touch the life of one, you touch th lives o plenty. So people, let the truth be known, we own the will and the way and so tell me what's the delaying. These are the latter days and benefits will be received. But only for the faithful who truly believe.

This is for the faithful who truly believe that Babylon is gone, you got everything yu need in your pal. So sing songs of thanks and praise. These are the fatter days, the latter days

When I appear I be the natural 4 divisions of the year; spring, summer, fall, winter, lend me your ear, got this mic her about to start a renaissance, unite all the colors of the world like Benetton. Keep the faith and move on, evolve, don't let it dissolve. Everybody sees the breaks, problems were made to be solved, the power's in your palm, the future's in your hand, open with possibilities, focus, why be afraid? Enter the unknown. Free where life gives you surprises, surprises give you life and your spirit energizes, reaching new horizons, promoting the uprising, rising above cuz el demonio be snuffin.

I beat on you what we go through is different 
We fight then get intimate the shit here is getting serious 
And marriage now I'm sensing it but I need sometime

I take her to my partner's, let 'em bust and leave her heartbroken

Make some noise, raise your hand if you's a boss bitch
I don't think he understand you's a boss bitch
Get some help if you can 'cause he lost it
Ain't no refunds, she spent the cash mayne
In your Benz with her friends in the fast lane
Flossin', you say ""How much it cost me?""
About a million dollars playa, she's bossy

I'm bossy
I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy
I'm the bitch ya'll love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told young stunna he should switch debate
I'm back with an 808 'cause I'm bossy

I’m here to distinguish,the bears from the penguins
Life is just a gap, get some money in between it
Glocks like police, pumps like fenas

Life’s a bitch, now die for her

I have the type of flow niggas don’t have to like
My rhymes is ambidextrous so I don’t have to write
The way I’m eating niggas wish they had my appetite
Straight up out of Texas and I’m major like Applewhite
I pour four then I hit the exit door
Take a trip to Macy’s cop the whole second floor
Hood smell the scent of money coming out my pores
Yeah my pockets full of dead people like a morgue, boy
I made it from a flyer to the Forbes
Young Elvis Freshley, yes he flyer than the stork
Dropping babies off in your chicks cheek, kicks neat
Got your son looking up to me like I’m 6 feet
Your daughter need someone to save her, not me
I’m knocking hoes down like Laila Ali
Try heat and I'mma put the toaster to your kidney

I pass her off to Mills then drop her off to Tune

This is No Ceilings bitch, roofless like a stadium
We shut down every fucking spot these bitches see us in

I was born in the Boogie Down catscan
Where my building fell down on the rats and
People sorta super wanna trip to the penile (penile)
While I settle off the shores of the Long Isle
My father's clean not mean my mind is clear when I transmit
I am the man-ner of the family cuz the pants fit
I want to let forensics prove, that I can mends
Groove wit the thread from needle outta hay, wanna say
Salutations to the nation of the Nubians
We bout to place you in that 3 Feet of stew again
I got the frequency to shatter Mrs. Jones' perm
I gotta +Hey Love+ all the honies cause they're short term
Tallyin the score I'm for the shottie in the jacket
For the brother he's a nigga when he packs it
So get your butt out the sling, I stung Muhammad float a note
That means I'm def, so like the autographs you sign until the

""Breakadawn, breakadawn""
Ah one two, ah one two

Ayo groove with the mayor, hazard on the sayer
Wave the eighteen mill', eat a still
Sack or bag of troubles, make the single double
Loop the coin and join the minimum wage
I had a plan if I was the man, I'd throw the J
Lay it low and late night I get sessed
Uncondition my ways, of the everyday sunset
Wagin my days, to the one bet
Cause your breaks'll have the carrot of cakes, whether mine
Out of line, I breeze into the early mornin
Freak the WIC call and get a tap on my shoulder
Cause the days of the breaks, be just about over
The arts of the six won't play my bag of tricks
I got the sevens in my pocket somewhere
Reasons for the Cheer All Temperature here
I keep it to the rear, and then I'm EXPLODING

I be the fab I be the fabulous but see unlike the Chi
I got the flea up in the name ""ah one two, ah one two""
Can't no one bend my cousin from the Peter Piper like the others
Latchin on to when I caught the fame ""ah one two, ah one two""
Pass the task to ask me bout the Native Tongue again my friend
I tell you Jungle Brothers +On the Run+ ""ah one two, ah one two""
I'm shakin hands with many devils in the industry
Believe the Genesis like Phil with stills mean that I'm def

We in the mornin at the end, but in the end I be the is
Cause in the mix, man, it's alright
Momma got the rhythm to my daylife
My pops gots enough so best to leave or sail the waves
To the Long I laid the anchor in the 'Ville
And how I relate, the same side of my gates
Paper days, mess up my mind, ground zero degrees
And the weather feels fine
You opened my eyes man, thought I had a man
But how could I eyescan, I wasn't around
I seen the states and played the dates in the far-far
Gathered the new, from the zoas around
Grew up with Mikey Rodes and played the codes
Sometimes I don't budge, without my cous' Fuzz/fuzz
A simple, ""How ya do?"" Ah check it from my friends and my crew
Makes it definitely special

Now there's no Shiny Happy People in the crew we play the rough
I got the huff, and puff, to blow the house low
You know the neverending factor while I'm over, tell a squid
I know an Enterprising brother, so report to the bridge
I bounce a ball with my left, a squid with my right
(Cause a squid is just a punk) Yo he deserved to lose the fight
I might meander 'cross your dream, travellin up the stream
Plug Wonder Wonder Why you're lonely tonight
We see the girls scream as if we're shocked by the live shell
Let's round em up and get em back to the hotel

Now Mr. club owner knows your jam
When your jam is tha jam
And there's a tab at the bar
My mindstate's great
No thanks I don't drink
I sip the bobo
Then I kettle it quick
I felt the heave in the jeave
Tap it in the basement
Diggin' my own understanding quick
Let me get the single out
Think mr. radio say the starlight
Is the same star bright
I'm thinkin' how a nine and a blunt is a switch
But turn out the lights and some will go bitch
It was one mc after one mc
Play the lamp post do the blow wit dynomite
Well it's okay and it's alright
Cause our birthday cake's external light
It'll all get graphic
People made of plastic
Look at the shine wit my 50 watt eye
But when I got the eye patch I hit the latch
I fame it to a name from denver up to maine
And lovin' deluxe

When you have some light on the face
Cause the focus is the fickle
'stead of fusin' I'm a use it
To the utilize the trickle caught the rush
But I play hush
While andres titus is the grabbin'
As a fan will put the hearts to mush
Lush dalea would hear the public beat
The same way for titus when he blacked the sheep
But as the knee went deep
To deeper off the charts
The album faded to black
That's when the amnesia starts

Should I shot it or begin

I saw big 4 go get shinin'
A typical flick was the moment
When the man said
""Ain't you?"" yeah I is 'im
Hush your mouth fallin' in cog
Caught the light being true dog
A fist of funk and I pocket that screen
In the scene or in between
Gimme but a little bit of the starlight

I had a choice, be like Mike, or be like you
I made a choice, now its be Crip or be Piru
Whatever I was, I was bangin' 'Gin & Juice'
Never knew back then, I'd be friends with Snoop
Now I gotta keep it gangster, cause its in my roots
So I owe you my life, when I betrayed you
I tried to think of what the fuck Eminem might do
If every nigga hated him, for the 'Black Bitch' track
And niggas stopped bumpin' Dre after T-Boz got slapped
When Doc say its a rap, its a rap
Its still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that

[Chorus]

[The Game]
I never said 'Thank You', and I took for granted
You let me in your house, and made me a part of your family
Now I'm eatin' with you, Eve, and Busta Rhymes
I wasn't starstruck, I was just glad to be signed
And even though sometimes I run loose
You still my homeboy Doc, I'd take a bullet for you
I'm not askin' you to take my side in the beef
But you told me it was OK to say ""Fuck The Police""
Now its my turn to carry the torch
And I still got the chain that you wore on the cover of The Source
Remember when we got drunk, to do ""Start From Scratch""?
I told you you was like a father to me I meant that
Sittin' here lookin' at my platinum plaques
Thinkin' what the fuck am I without a Doctor Dre track
When Doc say its a rap - its a rap
Its still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
See when the world is on your shoulder and the stress grows bigger
The fire in 'em, made it difficult to talk to the nigga
Most of the time I let 'em know I don't agree wit' what he do
But he a hard-head Dre thats why I'm talkin' to you
See when I first met my nigga son was layin' in the cut
Tight, reserve, homie was quiet and kept his mouth shut
Until you told him to spit for me, he flippin' from the gut
I dug his spirit, and I thought the dude was talented as fuck
And as the time went on, now he was workin' with the finest
I saw the pressure started to build, so I gave 'em additional guidance
You gave him something that can make or break a nigga you should face it
So big, I don't even think he was ready to embrace it
With the potential to be a strong nigga with conviction
The only problem was our little nigga wouldn't listen
But when Doc say its a rap, its a rap
Its still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that

[Chorus]

Shorty 101,"You can say anything
That I haven't heard before
So don't you think?
Your words will be
The key to open up that door
Cause I don't need someone to be
Around to put a smile on me
And you know it's plain to see
You only want to get with me, baby

1 - I can't believe that you're try-na get with me
With all those same old lies
You say that I'm just like the type of girl but
I don't have the time to get caught up in your silly game
I know you're full of lies
I don't need you in my life

2 - Is there anything you wouldn't say tonight?
Just to get with me
Am I gonna have to catch you in a lie?
I know that I don't really want to hear the same old lies
For you to get with me
Is there anything that you wouldn't do?
Is there anything you wouldn't say to get with me?

I'm tired of lies
I'm tired of cheating
All those foolish lies won't work with me
Can't get to me talking to sweet
Cause I know you'd say anything
To get with me probably have somebody already waiting
Calling me your only girl
Like you're the only one in the world

Repeat 1
So tell me...
Repeat 2
Do you really think I'd fall for that this time?
Do you really think I'd never realize?
Do you really think you'd have the chance?
To come at me again with those lies
All I wanted was to fall in love
I think I've really had enough
See I've seen it all before
So you'd better close the door before it hits you in the back
This time baby!

I can't get enough of that girl
Kevin Michael, Shorty Da Kid, lets go

When I first saw her she was licking her lips
With a gold chain hanging off the side of her hips
Glossy as the pages of a magazine
Got to figure how to get you on the team

So I asked if we could sit on the steps
And let a young G kick it from the right to the left
Gotta keep it movin? and work the game
Trying to spend a minute up next to your frame

she's so fine that it really, really blows my mind
I can't get enough of that girl
I can't get enough of that girl

In the morning, in the evening
Somebody shake me ?cause I feel like I'm dreaming
I can't get enough of that girl
I can't get enough of that girl

In the bedroom, on the table
Whenever, wherever I'm willing and I'm able
I can't get enough of that girl
I can't get enough of that girl

We took a ride in my Coupe De Ville
Doing drive-by?s all day, if looks could?ve killed
She would be the bullet that hit me hard
Got that kinda ass that's dangerous

And I ain't trying to be the one that she played
?Cause she's a dime, my nigga and I want her to stay
Brain that's just as bangin? as the body and
Shawty got me thinking I'm a family man

she's so fine that it really, really blows my mind
I just can't help myself

I can't get enough of that girl
I can't get enough of that girl

Hold on, stop, somebody blow the whistle
I gotta call a time out ?cause baby?s so official
It hit me like a missile when I seen it, shawty got me feelin?
Rise of the sun till the evening

Got me wanna clean and cook, maybe I'm dreaming
Listen, ba boom, ba boom, hear my heart beating
Weekends I don't even hit the club
?Cause first we on the couch then in the tub

In the bed it?s whatever she wanna do
We stop, take a break and get ready for round two
?Cause I can't get enough of that girl
I can't get enough of that girl

she's five foot nothing, I'm feeling the frame
A man that donkey on the back but like you need to be tamed
See I got her by the game, you know it?s a fact, boy
She telling all her friends she go with a track, boy, ay

she's so fine that it really, really, really blows my mind
And I can't get enough of that girl

Somebody shake me ?cause it feels like I'm dreaming

Screw (what's the deal my nigga)
Man, King Screw, dedicate this to you my nigga
We love you forever boy (straight up much love)
We ain't goin' never forget you mayn
Never forget the times we had (G love, know I'm saying)
Al-D and Z-Ro (ha) South Park Mexican

[Chorus: x2]
I'll never forget, the times when we crawled together
I'll never forget, the times when we balled together
I'll never forget, the love, hugs, smiles and tears
And the strength to help me conquer my fears

[SPM]
I'll never forget, the day we met
I was on Gravestone, trying to find a address
You told me that your wife, had just lost your baby
I never met a man, so hate free
Lately, I've been drunk as fuck
I open up a cold beer, as soon as I wake up
I live in Screwston Texas, that's my home
Banging Screw since 9-2, ask my T. Jones
When Fat Pat died, we was all alone
That boy was the coldest, on the microphone
Screw took it harder, than anyone thought
It's hard to be apart, from someone close to your heart
South Park from the start, all of a sudden
The whole nation, all bout the Screw Shop on Cullen
November 16th, I sat and cried
Cause that was the day, that Houston Texas died

[Verse 2]
I'll never forget true love see, it's gon last forever
Keep my feet on solid ground, so we could ball together
Since a young one never done one, stay true to the heart
You kept my head above water, gave me spark from the start
You put the mic in my hand, plus put your trust in me
Dodging cases being a G, you got me out of the streets
Gave me the capital of Texas, so I could throw away the pyreeces
Put a queen on my shoulder, when nights were cold as misses
Hustling smiles appear the tears, the tears from younger years
Until they find us riders, make sure you standing here
S.U.C. for L-I-F-E, Screw blew one with the streets
Slowed down originator, keeping the trunk on beat
My faith in G-O-D, putting the world up under my feet
Making imitators duketators, bow down and can't compete
From a G to a G, this here's for you to me
Staying down putting it down, screaming Screw for eternity

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3]
Whoever knew he would create a new sound, never been heard
Transform a simple name, into a household word
He gained fame but never changed, never switched gears
When you met him it was like, you been knowing him twenty years
Was never fake, blessed to make the rap scene elevate
Genius, watch that boy slow it down and still accelerate
God gave him a gift, and my partna knew how to use it
But the love I got for Screw, ain't got nothing to do with music
Cause when he left, the physical was consumed
But his spirit manifesting, everybody in this room
A real partna forever, I know I can never be him
But if I make him my example, when you see me then you'll see him
S for slowing it down, see cold creating
are stands for realer than real, and never hating
E forever lasting, effect never corrupt
W for the world, cause that's what he screwed up

[Verse 4]
Man I'll never forget, the difference time can make
Man I'll never forget, coming down in the 8
Man I'll never forget, we drunk the pint straight
We been free styling, since them old grey tapes
And then came the day, that we was making them G's
Had them niggas lined up, like we was slanging them ki's
But we ain't slanging D, we just moving C.D.'s
People coming to the shop, way from over the seas
But still we some G's, or should I say that we back
Coming down in a Impala, with the candy wet
Coming down MLK, with the music that bump
We was swinging and banging, steady popping the trunk
Say what's up to that Gator, Mafio and that Pat
I know why y'all looking down from heaven, watching over our back
When they mention Screwed Up Click, they goin' say that we done it
Man them boys done blew up, like the flight 800

[Chorus: x2]

[Willean]
DJ Screw player, I'll never forget
Represent S.U.C., forever my set
I'll never regret, the times we got blowed
On the road doing shows, all across the globe
It's your boy Willean, and I'm holding it down
Legendary status Screw, steady slowing it down
For H-Town for sure, we done lost a soldier
We goin' finish what you live, and I'ma put that on the Clover
It ain't over, pour and sipping the plain soda
Switching lanes over, in my black Range Rover
The Chemist that's right, I done shed some tears
All the car shows we wrecked, and bled for years
You one of my peers, DJ Screw you kept it real
You one of a kind, so you one out a mill
I'ma stay representing, South-side for live
And if S.U.C. get a deal, it's goin' be a hundred mill

[Al-D]
If nobody else, could feel my pain
It was you in my corner, through the heat and the rain
Can't call one time, you didn't make me smile
Took a fall in the Penn, boy you fed my child
Kept my name on fire, like I never left
Kept your eyes on my family, and never slept
Snatched my ass out the streets, and put a mic in my hand
Put my strap on the shelf tray, my fiends for fans
I was hard head misled, seeking for bread
Without the music in my life, I know I would of been dead
But the Lord sent you to me, like a guardian angel
When my feet was caught up in a tangle
So please smile for me, cause Screw you got me throwed in this game
I salute you with my fist, your name was never in vein
See the plack on the wall, all our dreams came true
And I'm still giving thanks to you

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer]
Gripping on wood grain
Keep on, keep on, keep on moving
Banging, swerving lane to lane

[Al-D]
Gripping on grain, while the 15's bang
Know you wonder if it's thunder, where the fuck is the rain
Lane to lane dripping blue, puffing on coo-coo
Candy wetter than do, banging nothing but Screw
Reclined on buck, like I'm stuck in the mud
Ripping my mug cause I'm thug, sipping straight out the jug
Ghetto thoed we ghetto known, wih mo' ice on my heart
Boy got mo' ice, than a W march
Bout to knock my trunk off, with this shit down South
Knocking pictures off your wall, when I pass by your house
Know your spouse is your trojan, if you love her than get her
Cause she stuck on a G, like a god damn sweater
Hotter than a baretta, trying to give it up fast
Left her stupid like cupid, and put a plug in her ass
Swanging glass moving fast, as I dash through your hood
Picking splinters out my palm mayn, gripping on wood

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2x]
[K-Rino]
Hear them niggaz bumping, but they can't forget
Swanging down bumping tip, champagne under the tent
Trend setter, red beam for plexing
Crawling, living the life of a Texan
Get down your block three in the morning, waking the hood up
Crawling purple passion, up in my cup
I-10 to 71, mash the gas to Austin
Chrome glossing, big bossing flossing
Block to block spot to spot, no need for tripping
Still collecting my ends, in the 2K dimension
Twist a leaf out the leaf, as I crawl through the street
Waiting on the sunrise, praying a G on deep
It's a Sunday a fun day, and I crawl down Sunnydale
Sparkling sun rays, making the game prevail
Jazzy broads whispering, boppers shaking they tail
You can do what you do, I'm all about my mail

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2x]
[Yungstar]
Lights, camera, action it's on
Bang out my garage, and I'm on 20 inch chrome
Grab my phone, cause I'm calling Al-D
When they see the buttons, don't try to compare me
She gon stare G, so you better get her
I'm coming down, and I'm banging the Hardest Pit of the litter
Down South, keep our name out your mouth
And we'll get it on, and we known to buy a house
And buy the block it don't stop, with shoes and socks
Bet the top drop, and let the bumper unlock
But me I'm rolling foreign, never ever alone
Swanging left and right, with alarm cats knowing
Paints I be pouring, and you know I'm so wet
Getting me a ticket from the laws, you want to bet
They can't stand me, pulling off they say you dripping too much candy
Yes I can't stand it, I'm the drank and drip bandit
You can't handle it, bought the ice that sunk the Titanic
Don't panic, when you see me riding with Janet
On the escapade, riding a Escalade
Break these boys off with techs, my chest plate

We gonna swang, we gonna bang
We gonna grip on wood, baby - 4x",Grippin Grain,2002

Screwed Up Click, my click of G's
Ah you got to feel that player M-O-E
Rolling with the Los, running with the codeine
And we about break, so take all you can

[Hawk]
Screwed up, what, chest be looking booed up
With the chemistry it's brewed up tracks get chewed up
Brighten the mood up, when I'm spitting this all
Above the law, coldest nigga you ever saw
Stay there, outlaw hand me up the state
I infiltrate your chest stain and increase the death rate
Don't hate, my, it only makes us madder
Pockets get fatter, then a only makes them say matter
Squash all the chatter in the southern region
I pledge of allegiance to my niggas not breathing
We all still breathing screaming S.U.C.
And that's the story mafios, and P-A-T
Niggas can't see me cause I'm rougher than most
You boys are like bread not butter and toast
They can't even come close, they done already told ya
Like the H-A-W-K and a screwed up soldier

See when we floss our candy rides
Screens keep falling from the sky
Players ball and we stay true
And if you want to test my click
I pop problems what you get
S.U.C. and we god damn fools
We got that purple sticky dank
Chased with purple sticky drank
And forever we gone bang screw
Oh it's the Screw in us, we gone represent with pride
It's the Screw in us till we die

[Lil' Keke]
Devastating and motivating it's the S.U.C.
Showing and blowing up since the year 93'
Everybody be claiming the click, they want to be down
Wait to trip, on a flip through H-Town
Let's take it back, cause you know we love that
Poppi in the gray lay with the with the fifth on the back of the lac
You know we ride chrome everyday
Having the ghetto dreams like my nigga P-A
We crossed inside and forever we glide
And one thing's for sure man southside's riding
Let's get this cheddar, you got your wood and your leather
Sitting tall on boys pushing dubs or better
This a click full of g's, so we do it with these
Keep the block on pop and the ice on freeze
Mo yo, and Keke for real it don't stop
S.U.C. took a mission on down to Wreck shop, come on

Screwed up click, gone keep it true
Oh P-A to, that DJ Screw

Years and Feelings
Hopes and Wishes
How many of them we share
How many of them we dare
To show, To Grow
Promise not let it go
Now look, what we become
So gone now, And I don't even get it
How a love like ours could fall apart in one minute
I'm sleeping in a happy home
The next minute, I'm walking out an open door...

[Pre-Chorus:]
And I'm driving down the rear way, swerving off
Trying to get myself together, Hoping I don't cry
Wanting to be together
But this feeling getting worse
Oh I never thought I ever feel this hurt

Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel
So I'm hoping like hell that it ain't 4real
Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel
Wishing that it ain't but I know that it is
2 days ago I felt like a star
2 hours ago just lost my heart
Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel
It's all I feel, it's all I feel

[Verse 2:]
Now I remember when I first knew ya
And I was all that had on your mind
Did I ever mean anything to ya
Or was I just something you did to pass the time
Cause now you won't hear me out
You ain't even tryin' to work it out
But I ain't going back
And even though I'm scared
I got too much pride
So I'm in my ride...

I guarantee that you're gonna miss my love

Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Shorty Rogers & His Orchestra,"Chora que a tristeza
Foge do teu olhar
Brincando de esquecer
Saudade vai passar
E amor já vai chegar

Entao canta que a beleza
Volta pra te encantar
Num sonho tao pequenho
Que o dia escondeu
Guardando pra te dar

Como é bonito gostar e querer ficar
Com alguém pra quem possa dizer
Olha quantas estrelas
Nascem pra te encontrar
Depois do céu azul
A noite vai chegar
E eu pra te amar",Chóra Tua Tristeza (Cry Your Sadness),2000

How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Shorty Rogers Big Band,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Anytime you pop that shit nigga
I'ma tell you you can suck a dick, you can suck a pussy
I know, it'll come to what? Say what?

Now I'ma let all you motherfuckers know
(See them knows that this is something you can't fuck, always)
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga, I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker?

Where you reside motherfucker?
How you live? How you see?
Sort the stack outs, this one's the blackout
Three-fifty-seven to your mouth

Dunn can you hear me? Raw is how I'ma inflicting this
It's that G type slang that makes this real sickening
Ignite my styles I got my hand upon the trigger
Starts from the smallest and hits the bigger nigga

Yo, straight actin' live about them hell fires
A known mental killer, or thriller, assassin of terror
The hot bloody fatal mixture of carbonate water
Homicidal manslaughter, death is the order start the mission

Travel like the speed of wind, through the valley of sin
I step to ville and murdered many man
Serving justice in my vicinity
This is, Brooklyn, Zu

I get down I get down I crack your fuckin crown
Lay around and watch some real niggaz break ground
I can't shop 'cause every bro blowin' up the spot
Hit rocks and niggaz know

Yo, niggaz grab the mic like the bites of a scorpion
Nervous, that's why the zoo brought me in
Now bring 'em forth, like the tortures at the courts
Before the case begin, first break me in his brain

And make sure he can't maintain the calmness
Ya harmless, watch how I bomb this
Stage like mail, pre hands that be the move
Now your Posse is your fuckin' Platoon

Stale cells, just flows through the air
I'm like a ninja, once I send ya down stairs
Then I get furious, imperious, the lyricist
With the cleverest rhyme erupt to deduct your fuckin' mind

Fuck, shit up on the hurry up
Known for burying ducks through more styles than a muck
Warning you chump, brain is out for lunch
Given the power punch, soon to be paid like Donald Trump

Never fall victim to no bitch
Jerked my dick, but still got more hoes than a pimp
And score more points than Shawn Kemp
Keepin' powerfully strong like the center on the Knicks

Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut
Ol' Dirty Bastard live and uncut
Shame on a nigga who tried to run game on a

Got more props than the President
My hardcore represent, blowin' niggaz back who never had this
'Cause I'm gifted, so you can get wrapped
The shit I'm kickin', send it to your moms for Christmas
And tell her, Shorty Shit Stain sent it

Soon to have more green than the Jolly Green Giant
'cause niggaz rap styles just down is aspired
You shoulda stayed home instead of picking up a microphone

But if you wanna run on up, like you tough
I call your bluff, and blow you down with my hardcore
Stuff, I shine like twenty-four carat

Roll and stroll with the party scene
Nigga wanna know me as Mr. Clean
Wza-wza-wza-wza-Wu-Tang, flip the script and
Test my skill niggaz, you're trippin'

Drugged up from sniffin', you're the one who's riffin'
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
Start to flip, slip, 'cause you're slippin'
While you sleep I be the God on point

With Scottie Pip pen as I, jump on stage, flip rip a show
Strip and rip a hoe, way like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxin', maxin'
Relaxin', sittin' back sellin' good tracks

And again and again when I rock the jam
Wanna see 'em up in the air? Throw up your hand
Introducin', one-man band in town
It's wild, with the style couldn't stand nigga

When the jump, stepped, to the center
Of the rhyme inventor, MC's come at the
You get dap slapped, across the MC map
Your ass that's your ass, on a whore shot

Come on through I black and blue your whole crew
Then I get Rudy with the Hong Kong Foo
Ol' Dirty Bastard, MC killer, money maker, Brooklyn, challenger
That I lay down like towel, then I get higher

Here comes the ill, type ruffer
Style be untouched I'm leavin' broken down grammars on the pen
Who who what? What brings it? Tighter than your anus
Chambers this name is for the deepest trainers

Keep it stainless, steel, on time it is the windmill
Deadly venom kills, at the last of the Sam's Mill

Hit you with the blast

Yeah, all why'all niggaz go Crazy
Leave the bitch-ass niggaz braindead in the daily

I might strip to my drawers, when I trip off the liquid
See maybe, I need to get fucked up 'til I hurl
'cause I'm Crazy like 2Pac screaming ""Fuck the world!""

[Chorus 2X]
[Christ Bearer]
Yeah, fuck that, go looney
Screaming ""Bitch, sue me"", off the wall like a young Paul Moonie
Break a rule, act a motherfucking fool
Roll a cutty on D's, solo at the carpool
Play Clyde Bearer's like a young Warren Beaty
Let Bonnie be ya lady so the bitch go Crazy

[Meko the Pharaoh]
While niggaz go Crazy I stay amazing
Doing what I do, straight blazing
Re-arranging, the time structure in the streets
Rotating planets like my people far out, you can't see
Believe it or not, a drop
NorthStar make ya heart stop
Too hot.. yeah, my shit stay live.. wit a vibe
that makes niggaz go Crazy when they get high (pass that)
Bitches button down ya button-fly
Niggaz bust ya fo'-five, get real live
'cause ya only live this life once
So bounce to this motherfucker like you own one (bounce)
Dip a stick and straight trip on a nigga
Take a sip and straight spit on a nigga
'cause the streets straight raised me
But they couldn't fade me (nigga), go Crazy

Shot in the Dark,"Out on the street, I'm stalking the night,
I can hear my heavy breathing.
Paid for the kill but it doesn't seem right;
something there I can believe in .

Voices are calling from inside my head.
I can hear them, I can hear them,
vanishing memories of things that were said,
they can't try to hurt me now.

But a shot in the dark, one step away from you.
A shot in the dark, always creeping up on you

Taught by the powers that preach over me
I can hear their empty reason
I wouldn't listen I learnt how to fight
I opened up my mind to treason

But just like the wounded and when it's too late
They'll remember they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now

But a shot in the dark one step away from you
A shot in the dark not a thing that you can do
A shot in the dark always creeping up on you

But just like the wounded and when it's too late
They'll remember they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now

But a shot in the dark one step away from you
A shot in the dark not a thing that you can do
A shot in the dark always creeping up on you",Shot in the Dark,1981
Shot Jackson,"Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end

The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again

Together again
The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong

The love that I knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
We're together again

And nothing else matters
We're together again
",Together Again,1971
Shot Jackson,"The ballroom was empty the hour was three
They played the last waltz for my darling and me
My poor heart kept wishing the night would not end
For she loved another and I'm just her friend
I love her, I love her my lonely heart cried
But soon she'll become another man's bride
She told me that Sunday was her wedding day
I gave my best wishes what more could I say
That night will be cherished in my memory
When they played the last waltz for my darling and me
She told me that Sunday was her wedding day
I gave my best wishes what more could I say
That night will be cherished in my memory

少しでも問いつめたら
あなたはもう
会ってくれなくなるでしょう?
わがままは言えないよ
どうしてもあなたじゃなきゃ
だめなの

追えば追うほどに遠くなるばかり

たまに優しくして
たまに突き放して
そばにいたい それだけで
待っていられるわ だから
何度傷付いてもいいの

Shotta,"Nadie es feliz para siempre
Aprovecha tu presente
Felicidad intermitente

Eres la psique más bonita que uno puede tener
Eres la chica más cara y más mala
Vete a saber
Si cuando vienes vienes de verdad
O de broma, no sé
A todas horas, a solas, estoy enganchado a tu placer

Yo quiero que esta canción suene
Como un niño al nacer
Con el miedo y el llanto
De todo por conocer
Buscando la felicidad quizá te puedas perder
Yo sólo quiero sentirte como la primera vez

Tú sólo quieres salir de este mundo
Oscuro por fin
Dejar atrás toda la movida negativa en un plis
Es complicado como el tiempo y la vida
Por decidir
El camino es duro y procuro tenerte por aquí

¡Felicidad! ¿dónde estás?
Enséñame el camino
A veces creo que no existes
Que eres un estado de ánimo
Nadie es perfecto tú piensa eso
Si sale del corazón lo que escribes
Tendrá más peso
Piensa que el odio es un lastre
Ápartalo de en medio
La vida sin amor es el pozo de un cementerio
Eres la droga, la que mata la tristeza
La que limpia las lágrimas
En el alma cuando todo pesa

La felicidad
Toda la vida buscándola
Y si quieres saber dónde está
Observa tu recorrido, mi hermano
Ella siempre ha estado a tu lado
Contigo
Y la felicidad
Si ya la tienes compártela
Y sino no vale na
Hay felicidad pa' cada hombre
En cada nación

Felicidad vente p'acá
Que yo te canto
Hay quien es feliz con cien millones en el banco
Se nota en la cara, en la actitud
Cuando uno está feliz
Se le enciende la luz
A veces la razón no sirve, no funciona
No sucede
Hay personas que nunca se olvidan
Porque el corazón no quiere

La sonrisa de una madre
Eso es felicidad
La vida va mejor sin prisas
El positivismo se guisa
Trabaja cada dia para ser feliz
Difícil de conseguir
Ahí esta la meta
Da amor a tus amigos y a tus enemigos, sí
No te vayas a la cama con rencor
Déjalo fluir
¿Se portaron mal contigo?
No seas vengativo
El olvido y el perdón son el mayor castigo

¿Tu novia te dejó?
Sal que te dé el aire
Si el amor se acabó yo lo que no quiero
Es engañarme
Lo que no se suelta en lágrimas
Se va con los suspiros
Yo solo suelto un te quiero cuando el corazón me obliga
Digo booom!
Felicidad intermitente
Aprovecha tu presente
Nadie es feliz para siempre

La felicidad
Toda la vida buscándola
Y si quieres saber dónde está
Observa tu recorrido, mi hermano
Ella siempre ha estado a tu lado contigo
Y la felicidad
Si ya la tienes compártela
Y sino no vale na
Hay felicidad pa´cada hombre en cada nación
Felicidad en la tormenta
Es un rallo de sol
Después de la batalla recibir bendición
Vivir lejos de lágrimas
Cerca del amor
Felicidad es tremenda sensación
Porque la vida con felicidad es más intensa
Vivir rodeado del dinero no compensa
La felicidad es la mayor recompensa
Mucho más que oro, que carros y ofrendas

La felicidad
Toda la vida buscándola
Y si quieres saber dónde está
Observa tu recorrido, mi hermano
Ella siempre ha estado a tu lado contigo
Y la felicidad
Si ya al tienes compartela
Y sino no vale na
Hay felicidad pa´cada hombre en cada nación",Felicidad,2014

Intro: 



This is how we goin' do 

We goin' do this right 

Word  word is bond 

Know what I'm sayin' 

This is LA wid the track 

Know what I'm sayin 

You know how we do 

Word up  yo 

Let Dark pass no stunting 

>From the real 

Better get your 4 pound God 

Let's proceed 

Yo  what yo  yo 



Verse 1: LA 



I run up on rap like Boo Smith on a hatchback 

Put my patch down cause a head crack 

I'm trapped, in a hole filled with guns and drugs 

Three-headers, nothing better 5% and thugs 

Style tight like O.J. gloves 

Niggas state to state take a bug 

'Cause I burn rich niggaz who will hide slugs 

It's the coke that got me caught, 

in this dead train of thought 

We stepped the coroner theft law from the Bronx New York 

Holding a pitchfork for cream 

Eyes on high beam, 13 

Cooking up coke, selling as dope fiends 

Now realise my anger as I craft my chamber 

With no parental vision made a fucking head-banger 

Who's in change a, you dis this judge you get finished 

Disrespect Darkman you get slapped with a Guinness 

Kid spin it, baby MC's I'm just choking 'em 

My shit hits the town like 300 pounds of opium 

What, turbulence which is your first defence 

Scripts stay scrapped to kill an action-packed defence 

Cocoa plants, I payed the cost in a loft 

Now lyrically candy topping niggas and buttered soft 

As the holocaust 



Verse 2: Shotti 



Prepare for the killin' shield 

Sight you lose to nightmares 

Stan man and my desert ??? 

Then I slip to the US, and then, 

The battle thought you had me screw-finched hologrammed 

You can stick it to death 

Talk means you scot 

Einstein dangerous mind 

2 heads and 4 eyes 

This man X, 

I'm known when I'm off my shift 

Scarf on my waist pull then I'll scorch your face 

I'm like a copy-cat killer 

Born for strangling niggas 

Then pull figures 

Receive and rob the spot like Dillinger 

Settle cap like ??? 

I'm saber-toothed coming at you 

Forfeit the minds can't win wit' no .22 

Get nuke and henny rock 80 proof 

In the hood, never sipping while I'm drinking my jewel 

Dance to my ritual, lower you into my seance 

Bitch wearing Avon 

Missing me ?on the rap song? 

I'll buck, you frontin' wit out that GK bubbly stuff 

Gang games for schools that's why your whole shit gets laced up 

With the mic as my staff 

I inscribe my witchcraft with full blast 

Buddah cut, shot these screw cats 



Verse 3: LA 



When I'm lifted 

Rip shit up kid quick I'm busted 

On any demon puffing hizo can't be trusted 

Lustic lyrical blunts be like mud 

DARKMAN THE KING, lampin' on my throne of blood 

Lynch men, verbal henchmen, kickin' your door in 

Blastin', rip, flippin' your shit, rippin' your organs 

Triple darkness, lies trap a constant rip juggler 

Snake eyes dedicated undercover smuggler 

As I cut you 

I slice your brain right without the mic 

Vivid literature pictures shine like four nine lights 

Time in space, grab your head-bands, suffocate 

Call me Chester so i had to let 

them rappers I wake on fuck 'em break 

I hold crack like your ass 

Lick shots from the techs then jet through the wet grass 

Bubble worth like a bass, 

Darkman instancy, sniff canibus living 

part in the Caribbean Sea 

Through your history the dark scenes will make you ears beam 

Talking 'bout hitting rap then sit back and hit your weed 

LA can walk through walls stand straight up in fire 

Look at your eyes look at my eyes pussy 

and tell me who's higher 

Darkman empire guard you now like a gun 

Loading wid nine rich niggas and I'm bound to be the tenth one 



Verse 4: Shotti 



Read my jungle 

Got the far eye see shot predator 

Detonator blowin' up city blocks 

Wid' a large watts 

About six clocks 

That's high potent killers on each corner 

Wid guns ready for smoking 

Six sense Indian head hancho 

Yo my peso got royals that screw Castro 

Operation statement my technique will be an experiment 

For my alliance I catch skins of ten lions 

What you trying tasting this sawed off iron 

Adjustable punk fashion came out your whole batch 

My plan to wrap this town like Saran 

All I need is guns and a few good men 

Shotti, stay like Scarface wid a key to shoot somebody 

Come get me, my fingers dipsy, 

Who's coming whippy, I'm a yippy 

First enemy who's stealin' filthy 

Size 'em up break 'em down I'm guilty 

My sons is wit' me 

Shot like 150 watts and fistful like Kung-Fu plots 

Wid my sing-sing shot 

You form something that can't be stopped 

Got a glock the fuck up your snot box wid a shot 

What! 



Outro: 



Sing-sing 

Knaw what I mean

I need a face 'cause that'll fix whatever's broke in my brain

Well, I'll probably just throw them away

I seem free but I'm enclosed in a cage
Though I continue to ponder over the plastic
And I ain't gonna do any better
Do I whimper from the future, and buckle under the pressure
Or do I step to the plate, and gon' take the chance with my life
And come face-to-face with the darkness so I can stand in the light, like?

When I feel your love upon me
I know that I am truly blessed
Sometimes we've gotta face the darkness
Just get me to the light again

Show & A.G.,"[Intro: Showbiz & A.G.]
Showbiz got props, tell me who got the props
A.G. got props, tell me who got the props
Give me my props for '92
It's me and Showbiz, and this is what we gonna do
Give you some now, save some for later
Here's a portion, yo Show, kick the flavor

[Showbiz]
Record labels try and juice me (for what?) for my papers
The offer me a mule (and what else?) and 40 acres
I'm dissing snakes now, there's no time to catch the vapors
I'm not a pup (for what?) a Muppet caper
And all the ghetto groupies get free with the quickness
And Show concentrates and only thinks about business
I hate a sellout cause he puts me in a rage
I play KRS and throw that ass off the stage
So give me my props cause I always stay clever
And ain't nothing changd but the weather
Get your act together, cause I got mines together
Don't front on the brother with the Pelle Pelle leather
I'm Show be	-I-Z, my partner's A.G.
Chill with Greg N-I-see-E or my brother D-are-E-S
And what's up to Lord Finesse
And I'd like to give shouts to my peeps Shorty and Wes
People say I'm soup, crazy cash I recoup
Nowadays I just troop in my green Legend coupe

[A.G.]
Record companies try to juice me for my papers
They offer me a mule and about 40 acres
They try ot gain from my royalties
Push me towards the dotted line but you know I didn't sign
Labels know straight up when we meet
Interfere with my career and it's back to the streets
Bang bang or the pow pow
I settle the beef the best way I know how
Release the savage beast if I'm not taking care
Rap is my career and it's my only way outta here
Every chance I do damage
And I manage to use all the anger to my advantage
All that is cool, but my brain is the tool
Gimme my props so we all can rule
Don't show off my skills, I just sprinkle em
And you're sleeping on my props, wake up before you wrinkle them

Gimme my props yo, more than a cop yo
Til I master hip-hop, I won't stop yo  (Repeat 4x)

[Showbiz]
The say BMW's a Black Man's Wish
I wish for an SP-1200 and some discs
Negativity the least, my material's is cease
Saying peace to the brothers in the belly of the beast
People saying ""Why Show want to rhyme?""
I didn't want to get back and do Fed time
I want to live right and exact, I don't want to be the fat cat
Off the crack and have the Feds down my back
If the money's stacked, take a step back, black
Or you'll be wearing four four numbers like a quarterback
I was raised one deep by mom dukes and no dad
And now I grab a number two pencil and a pad
Or Erasermate if I make mistakes I erase
And me a Diamond go diggin' in the crates
(Where's my 40 acres?)  Not the projects of course
I asked for a mule, I got an iron horse
Shit goes on as the song plays
Can a devil fool a Muslim?  Nah, not nowadays

[A.G.]
On your mark, get set, pass the 40, let's jet
A fat rhyme is what you want, a fat rhyme is what you'll get
It's thorough, from beginning to end
The beat is fat, what can I say?  Show you did it again
I got the hat on my head, Pepe's on my behind
Fans on my back, and money on my mind
I don't sweat the stress, take the bitter with the sweet
Did I let you know I have the Tims on my feet?
You know my stats when I came around
Saying ""Damn he's living fat"" when I haven't even gained a pound
Friends til the end, never will I diss ya
My people's R.I.P., you know I'm gonna miss ya
40 acres and my props, the name of the song
A.G. is saying peace and I'm gone

Show & A.G.,"""I like my pockets fat not flat"" (repeat 4x)

""I like my pockets fat not flat"" ""So get back"" (repeat 4x)

[Showbiz]
My pockets stay fat, and they always like that
Not only in pocket but in my bank there's stacks and stacks of dough
Cause I move slow, I get my cash flow, and then I go
And brother's don't know, I'm on the down low
Some get mad cause they can't understand
That I'm 23 years old, I'm in command
I'm down with DITC, that's ""Diggin' in the Crates""
And my partner A.G., we always keep crazy papes
I'm staying fat, cause what comes around goes around
I always help out and help a brother when he's down
And out like a boyscout, brothers always shout
""Good lookin out Show""  Yeah, without a doubt
But don't try and take advantage
I'll just leave you alone instead of putting that ass in bandages
Signing off is Show be	-I-Z
And next up is A.G., he likes his pockets F-A-T

""I like my pockets fat not flat""  (repeat 4x)

[A.G.]
Check it out yo, A.G. is living fat
In the mental, in other words can I get a soul clap?
Diggin' in the crates for something smooth
Showbiz & A.G., yo money, we make the party groove
And I'm a top-notch competitor
Carrying dough like a treasurer
Getting pussy, oh that's regular
But the sex I never take
Cause if that bitch screams rape, like Mike Tyson, I'm upstate
And you know that's a fact, black
So if she says no, that means no, and that's that
No matter how cute or how desperate
(Ayo she gotta get the boot)  Yeah, she gotta see the exit
But I'm not mad I didn't hit it
I just dial seven digits and some skins that's with it
Bones in the closet, that's my logic
You gotta be smart and keep a downlow in the projects
Watch your step and take it easy
Or act like Stevie Wonder because you know you can't see me
Don't sniff no coke, but I might drink a brew
Or maybe two (Andre the Giant, not you)
Yeah, wrecking MC's with just my demo
And pulling all the cuties with no problemo
That's right, because I'm a gamer
Your girl let you for me, A.G., I don't blame her
Step back, get your sticks and your bats
Know you step up because my pockets are fat

""I like my pockets fat not flat""  (repeat 3x)

[Showbiz]
It's time to take the brothers from the corner
Clean up they act, and give them a chance to do what the want to
I'm not trying to be a bum with a 40
That's not my style, I gotta work hard like Naughty
By Nature, you should understand
To get yours in this land, you gotta work for yours, black man
You think it's easy because I rap?
So don't ask me for a dollar motherfucker, you ain't handicapped
And if you was, you'd still have the chance
Look how I flip ""ain't this a bitch"" now I'm making you dance
Yeah it's Show be	-I-Z from your neighbor H-double-O-D, I are-A-P
Cause I want to stay fat
To keep clothes on my back and you know I never slack
For all the bums that said I forgot where I came from
Eating crumbs on the corner in the slums
I'm hungry enough to grow fangs
Here's a dollar, go to the store, but give me back my fucking change
I'm not trying to spend on so-called friends
Not even with skins, put that bullshit to an end
So fuck the groupies on tour
I'm trying to make a million dollars, some shit I never saw before
So save that bullshit for later
So when I'm large, hoes give me head on an escalator
Yeah, I like to flow, I'm Show be	-I-Z

Before becoming a runaway slave, here's a taste of
mental slavery.  A backtrack...

(""You don't catch hell because you're a Methodist or a Baptist
  You don't catch hell because you're a Democrat or Republilcan
  You don't catch hell because you're a Mason or an Elk
  And you sure don't catch hell because you're an American
  Because if you were an American you wouldn't catch no hell
  You don't catch hell because you're a black man."")

Check it, many try to come close
Rest in peace to the deceased and the rest are comatose
I'm not a joke and I go for broke
And while I'm laughing you'll be gagging from the motherfucking gunsmoke
Walk the streets and I play for keeps
And while I entertain suckers stay six feet deep
It was good while it lasted
Broken bones and asses, tombstones and caskets
I got fleeced, I'm not strapped, I'm a get you back
Me saying ""Mayday"" with an AK, picture that
Getting my props while you're propless
And if you try and escape, we'll take grandma for hostage
I carry my joint
Hoping to smoke a sucker just to keep on point
When Dre's team goes to extremes call up an M.D.
Wetting a strip til my whole clip is empty
Oh-ops and tecs ready to wreck the site
Whoever's next to step is knifed in broad daylight
Don't try to run, you'll get blocked off
I got spotted by a cop, so now that cop is knocked off
if I get back I get out with the quickness
The D.A., the judge and the jury's on my hitlist
Dressed in black with a hoodie and a low hat
(What you did?)  Spoke to the witness, now the witness don't know jack
The Giant and his crew are ill
We're sick-ass convicts, we're hard to kill

My boys from New York         (Is hard to kill)
The brothers from Jersey      (Is hard to kill)
I say out in Philly           (Is hard to kill)
And the brothers in Boston    (Is hard to kill)
To all my peeps in Cali       (Is hard to kill)
Don't forget about Atlanta    (Is hard to kill)
To all my boys in Connecticut (Is hard to kill)
To my crew in Texas           (Is hard to kill)

I'm around the way, 141st and 3rd
40 bottles on the curb and my man got the bag of herb
Another brother tried to get ill
And try to take me out on my block, he forgot I was hard to kill
I ran for cover so the brother missed
He hit my man in the head, now Ed is dead, yo what is this?
I won't stop until I see him rest
He got popped by the cops, too late for the EMS
Ain't no chance for survival (Why's that?)
He tried to go head on, now he's dead on arrival
Now you know I don't play around
Cause the clown is face down and uptown is his burial ground
You want beef?  Well the more the merrier
And I'm a bury that man's clan in the same area
My entourage is fully strapped
Turning your hard bodyguards to wussy, and pussy cats
You know how we do it
Putting the glock to the test, go get your vest, I'm going right through it
He survived in intensive care
Did the impossible in the hospital (Knocked him off right there)
I'm an expert at disposal
You see, everyone goes, on foes I'm killing hoes too
Nobody takes the witness stand
Your ass is out, I'm cleaning niggas out like Spic 'n' Span
You want beef with a mastermind?
But it's fine, pass the nine, now it's disaster time
I love conflict and confrontation
Killing enemies worse than Kennedy's assassination
But that's not my style
I just got buckwild so I could prove I was versatile
Styles go on and on
A.G. is all about peace, speaking of peace, now I'm gone

To the brothers in D.C.             (Is hard to kill)
And the brothers in VA              (Is hard to kill)
Down in North Carolina              (Is hard to kill)
How about the brothers in Maryland? (Is hard to kill)",Hard to Kill,1992

He say, she say, brothers be yapping
Running they mouths and don't even know what happened
Just for conversation you run your lip
And now my man's got problems, so now he's got to flip
His girl is heated, and she's leaving too
Because you ran your mouth, what you said wasn't even true
See my man's name is Victor
His brother Mike is boning Shante, that's Eric's sister
Mike had a girl, but Shante knew
But on the downlow a little rendezvous
One day upstairs the two were chilling
His girl popped up, yep yep, she started illing
Mike said that's Victor's undercover lover
So victor caught on and had to cover for his brother
Walked Shante home, and said so long
But somebody saw the two and thought they had something going on
It got around like a hula hoop
And you made it your business, Victor's girl knew the scoop
Know she's beefing, flipping and crying
Didn't believe when he said that they were lying
It's over, the relationship is done
Victor was a loyal brother if I ever knew one
You say he's wrong, but that's not a fact
See if you don't know the story then you shouldn't say jack
Well it's over anyway, huh
And Victor is the victim of he say, she say

(""He say, she say, I heard it throught the grapevine"" - Greg Nice) (repeat 4x)

Losing a girl is one thing, but there's another side
Of he say she say, a lot of brothers died
All the gossip don't belong in the streets
>From another brother talking now you got major beef
Two kids had a beef, one was your man
They went out like troopers, and they went out with their hands
Your man took a loss, but he left it at that
But you made it your business to say he was coming back
The other kid wouldn't have it
So he ran to his car, yeah he packed the automatic
And you knew he wasn't joking
So you called up your man, ""Yo yo, we gotta smoke em""
Came downstairs with the nine and the vest
Little did you know he didn't aim for the chest
Caught him in the head, now your man is dead
Rest in peace chief, cause of something that you said
Tell it to his family on his funeral day
And your man is a victim of he say, she say

He went out like a trooper and took two to the head
Somebody said to me that I'm not A.G.
Because the Giant is dark-skinned and 6'3""
Somebody told Show that A.G. can't flow
That witch is crazy, because you know I'm good to go
(Ayo I heard Showbiz is making money off the crack)
He doesn't have to Jack, because he's making fat tracks
You don't even know and that's upsetting me
And I won't be a victim, so don't put me in Jeopardy
The ones who yapped this goes out
Always putting other words in other people's mouth
I'm a end it on this note, okay?

Once again back again with my friends
Diamond's beats are fat just like a Benz
Andre the Giant is great, but I should also mention
Lord Finesse, he's the Funky Technician
I'm on my way to the studio, it's the only way that I know
How to play down low
Punching keys like Rocky Balboa
Saying rest in peace to Tshaka Figeoroa
Some got to grow up before they blow up
And did you ever know a young brother who had shit sewed up?
Rented some BM's some Volvos, some Benz
So much jewls I had to pass shit down to my friends
But when down and out and pockets are low
See how fast friends go when there's no cash flow
So I head for the top, times are hard
Pushing moms, no pops, I had to get my own props
I can wild out, but instead
I just keep to myself and Showbiz just hold his head

Another friend was laid to rest
This world is just chaos, confusion, and a big mess

To leave town, never stay down but keep rising
>From the ghetto, not always ghetto minded
Some is striving, the finish line they never find it
All of the sudden they life stops

Is this the day you pull me over, searching for cracks and coke?
What's the problem, you know I'm sober
If you drove a fucking Nova you wouldn't have to pull over
You're making me late, my papers is straight
Never hesitate to run a check and then let me skate
Take my business card, it's in my left hand
You got the right motherfucker but the wrong goddamn plan
So pass me by, or you wonder why
Niggas pull out their glock and point it right between your eye
But I got my shit together, I never flip with the weather
And I always think clever
I think positive and legit
I gotta give big shouts to my peeps Kendu and Infinite
Brothers stare into my face like I'm a sucker
It's too easy to kill another young motherfucker
So I ignore it, I turn the other cheek
Yo Show, you ain't got any time for these niggas, these boys is weak
Some punks want to spit razors shit for rocks
Packing a glock, and I don't shoot blanks
Young boys that thought they was ready, step to this
They made wrong moves because that ass got rocksteady
Down the line, far from kind
Whip in behind, and still packing nothing but a nine
Back on the block, or out on the streets

But I can't live trife, shot stabbed with a knife

Baseball battin' 'em, splattin' 'em,
So many homicide records, my cases went platinum.
D'shawn is nice,
Known for givin' out head cracks without touchin' dice.
Just pain and punishment from the boogie down bronxter,
D'shawn the maniac street mobster.

[Chorus]

It's the f-I-n-e-double-s-e,
Don't play or stress me
Cause that shit don't impress me
I make papes off the shit I create, and then dictate
So get your motherfuckin' shit straight
I got skills and I'm hard to kill,
So y'all bitch-ass rappes better chill and just guard your grill
You grab a mic and always get hype
Talkin' bout fuckin' niggas up
When you can bearly beat your dick right
So stop ridin' my dilznick
Cause I can still kick the ill shit on the motherfuckin' real tip
Hit like foreman when I'm brawlin'
Those who think I'm fallin, I'll play your monkey-ass like a organ
I got crazy niggas in the city noid
Got mad bitches, but it's not cause I'm a motherfuckin' pretty-boy
I'm ruthless, I'm not on that goody-goody tip
That shit played out with that beat street/electric boogie shit
I'll stomp any rapper that you ?
If they ass is weak, they better chill and grab a seat
And go 'head with they master plan
Stevie wonder probably see me 'fore half you rappers can
You can't hang and you're fallin' fast
You rappers that's trash better dash and start haulin' ass
Cause I'm out to rag shit
Fuck up a show, collect my dough
And step off with a bad bitch
Spectators always have the best time
When they come to a show and hear a funky lord finesse rhyme
I'm out to get bigger, lounge and make rich figures
You'll never catch finesse associating with bitch niggas
I work overtime when it's time to go for mine
Crab-ass rappers, don't even front cause y'all know the time
So it's time for me to step
Peace to showbiz and ag and I'm off to the left

[Chorus]

Check-check-check it a to the g is gonna wreck it.
On stage, on my record, so nigga don't forget it.
I'm the man. the one-man-band is on my right hand.
(his name is show nitwit, so get wit the program)
I get a hit from my Buddha blessed.
Turn my hat to the back, now let's see who's the best.
I like my pockets fat, never ever flat.
Niggas wanna jack, my .45 ain't havin' that.
Hoes get no dough, so why try?
Think it's gonna be a hit 'n' run? wrong, it's a drive-by.
Niggas catchin' tantrums,because your girl's never safe around
The midnight phantom.
They predicted I'm-a fall,
They must be down with Michael Jackson cause that shit is off the wall.
You don't believe me, ask that brother show,
Snatchin' hotties, grabbin' hotties, lettin' mothafuckers know.
You come wrong if you don't come strong,
You better catch wreck! mothafucker, I made the song.
Styles will vary, they won't carry over.
Don't fuck with no devil, I'd rather marry Oprah.
Yeah, you got it, I'm pro-black,
And my skills are so phat, I pay my dues, I don't owe jack.
You bite my style, I can spot it.
Tryin' real hard to get it,
You can forget it, because you don't got it.
And my skills are excellent, diggin' in the crates
And it's time to represent!

Show & A.G.,"Runaway... runaway slave (8X)

Verse One: A.G.

Livin in the slums with the bums, the rats and the stray cats
Dogs with the rabies, little babies are having babies
Juveniles act wild
Every footstep you take, on every corner there's a crack vial
Pushers, dealers, crackheads are buying
Now the dealer's in jail, all the crackheads are dying
My man got AIDS, he was hit hard
To get laid, he paid a crackhead for a five dollar quick job
In the ghettoes this stuff you have to find
A beer will relax my mind but I still pack my nine
Cause I'm aware of all evil and devilishment
Because I'm living in a rat like settlement
Sometimes it's hard to manage
I grab a forty take a sip and let the mental do the damage
Yeah I'm woozy and my eyes are red
But it's better than a uzi and a brotherman is dead
See nine out of ten are black on black crimes
Four out of nine were killed before their prime
The other five wanted vengeance
So now five out of five are doin a jail sentence
Ask the Giant I've been through it
So when I reach to the top, I say the ghetto made me do it
And I know how to strive, huh
Born and raised in the ghetto so you know I can survive

Chorus:Runaway... runaway slave (8X in background)

I gotta getaway, I gotta do it now
or find a better way, so how that sound (both lines repeat 4X)

Verse Two: A.G.

Chapter two, of every black man's diary
Drugs and diseases, put in our society
Kill another brother and it's bravery
Come on that's one step backwards into mental slavery
Yeah you best believe that's reality
You got black on black then there's police brutality
Yeah it's bad but what makes it sad
Is that I'm being harassed by a black man with a badge
He's sellin out because he's two-faced
But you only got one race, you only got a nigga's face
He's sellin out because times is hard
And old ladies are gettin robbed cause I can't find a job
Fight to the top, and the other man'll drop
and gettin treated like savages will stop
You got the right plan, but goin about it the wrong way
Divided is the long way united is the strong way
Too many died for us to take a pause
So let's all get ours, and stop tryin to get yours
Walk a straight path, but it's so easy to stumble
So weak minds crumble in the concrete jungle
Get your chance to sell drugs, you don't pass up
But a fast buck will wind up to be your last buck
It's a damn shame, you're deaf dumb and blind
Did it ever cross your mind, you're killin off your own kind
And pretty soon even you will be a goner
Easy access to guns, liquor stores on every corner
Street knowledge is a must, you never learn enough
You're physically rough, but mentally you gotta be tough
We shall overcome with no doubt
The runaway slave is sayin peace and I'm out

Chorus

I gotta getaway, I gotta do it now
or find a better way, so how that sound (2X)

Show & A.G.,"[Showbiz]
Yeah, it's time to silence the lambs.  Let niggas know what time it is
on the real tip, know what I'm saying?  Showbiz & A.G. killing all the
garbage going around, know what I'm saying?  A.G. still got it going on,
Showbiz got it going on.  And we going to kick a little flavor like this.
In 1992, I silence the lambs.

[A.G.]
Now this goes for those who thought I fell
But it's more to tell, cause them suckers are sort of jel
Cause the Giant finally got his props
We can box rhyme for knots and see who got the biggest glocks
It don't matter cause I can withstand
I got no hair on my chest but I'm still the motherfucking man
I won't fall and I never fell
Busting and chrushing tall all of y'all who take a fucking L
You think you're able to win?
You better chill cause you never will, you ain't and you never been
You can't faze me so sit and praise me
When I'm finished slaying y'all be saying ""That nigga's crazy""
That's how I like it, yeah they fear me
Their face is scary, they know I'm coming but they can't hear me
I'm crushing motherfuckers that's coming up
The champ is me, see, it ain't no runner ups
I'm catching wreck because I'm getting vexed
You can forget it if you think you're going to get it and rip it next
Yeah, whatever's clever
And like Heatwave I'm slaying niggas always and forever
Let me know that I'm still the man
And killing all the riff raff in the silence of the lambs

[Showbiz]
Showbiz and I silence the lambs
To my partner A.G., silence the lambs
To my man Lord Finiesse, silence the lambs
To my peeps Gangstarr, silence the lambs
To Nice and Smooth, silence the lambs
To my peeps Black Sheep, silence the lambs
To my man Chi-Ali, silence the lambs
To my man Jazzy Jay, silence the lambs
To my partner Diamond D, silence the lambs
To my man Fat Joe, silence the lambs

[A.G.]
Now who's stepping first, cause it's time for the second verse
You want to withdraw?  Then don't stall, cause it's getting worse
I gotta show off my stuff
If it's a 40 I'll take a sip, if it's a blunt, then I'll take a puff
I'm undisputed even when I'm bhudded
So act like Bo Jackson after surgery and don't do it
Yapping, diss A.G., it won't happen
While your jaws are japping, it's your girl that I'm tapping
Then she'll bust a nut and guess what, now I'm flowing
You try and act wild, I'll pull ya foul cause your style is stolen
My crew said to catch wreck
Then tell me why you want to flex showing knowing that I'm going next?
Is it because I'm your idol right?
Cause I'm hitting harder than a champ in a heavyweight title fight
You tried to quote some shit I wrote
You try to play me like a kid and I'll shove a doll down your fucking throat
You see me coming, start ducking down
When I speak, you don't speak, so shhhh, don't make a fucking sound
You want to go through hell?
Well you thought I fell, so come on and take a fucking L

[Showbiz]
Rappers caught jel when I jumped on the scene
They said I was a rookie and my name was Charlie Sheen
Some talked about my concert, they said I was wack
And 20% of beats was in my house in stacks and stacks
If I was blind I might break like a referee
So the next man can't see round two or three
It takes round one to get the job done
A lesson and a blessing it's great to be Show, son
I don't talk tough, I'm not a tough guy
I'd rather buy a bean pie from a guy with a bow tie
Peace to F.O.I. cause they got the skills
To make brothers that act ill, chill
Wall to wall on the dance floor
I want to see your arms up even if you ain't sure
Before I kick styles that's legit
You gotta cover the mic with tissue cause I talk much shit
I leave girls with a smile and fellas real stunned
I make hard rocks split away, forget those young guns
Here's a new rap list blowing rappers out the anus
If you weak and grab the mic I'll make you famous
So don't flip or I'll hush you like a kid
In a crib, damn, it's time to silence the lamb

Big L gotta silence the lambs
To my man D'Shawn gotta silence the lambs
To Naughty By Nature, silence the lambs
A Tribe Called Quest gotta silence the lambs
To the Zulu Nation, silence the lambs
To my man Kid Kapri, silence the lambs
To the crew Main Source, silence the lambs
To BDP, silence the lambs
To the brother Freddie Foxxx, silence the lambs
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth silence the lambs
Afrika Bambaataa gotta silence the lambs and
X-Clan gotta silence the lambs",Silence of the Lambs,1992
Show & A.G.,"[Showbiz] 

Yeah  1992  Showbiz & A.G.  we about to catch wreck. And I 

Got my main man Diamond D  he's about to catch wreck from 

Diggin' in the crates and all that. And I'd like to say 

I chop off the head off of all those that commercialize! 

We got real bad bwoy in effect. Come Diamond D  come correct! 



[Diamond D] 

Yo check it 

See I'm back on the block but my name ain't Quincy 

Yeah, I'm chopping rappers up into mincemeat 

Step up and speak if your shit ain't weak 

The beat's for the jeep kid, they don't come cheap 

I practice my craft so you can call me macaroni 

And I get cheese and more run that a pony 

Smoke a lotta herb but I don't chew tobacco 

When Show drops the beat I say ""Holy mackerel!"" 

The stunts don't front any longer 

See my status is large, and the props are getting longer 

Ride around with Lou Dog in the Path 

Sit back and laugh or maybe sign an autograph 

I'm walking tall, but yo I'm not a cracker 

Don't run with the burgeouis, my crew's much blacker 

So give a shout for the man with the clout 

Sippin' on a Guinness stout, yo I'm about 



Showbiz, my man's still diggin' in the crates 

Diamond D, yeah I'm still diggin' in the crates (repeat 2x) 



[Showbiz] 

Ayo, it's often said, but it's never read 

That Diamond got a beat for every dread in his head 

But don't be mislead (Why?) Cause breakbeats are dead 

I'm not the Biz, who runs around with Super Pro Keds 

I'm just a cool brother, who hangs out in a top shop 

And I still get my props when giving brothers knots 

So step up front, yeah, that's if you want it 

It's time to breathe there's no future in fronting 

Cause they know, and I know, and she know, and we know 

That I'm an old champ like Bruno Samitino 

Or Ivan Pusky or the brother Tony Atlas 

Buy my EP and Showbiz will be the fattest 

And baddest is my status, I knew a man named Thatus 

Who rode a night train to Georgia just like Gladys 

Knight and the Pips, there's no 40's on my lips 

Yo pass the Moet, I might flip and take a sip 

And sit back and puff a blunt with Slick Nick 

Sometimes he puff slow, sometimes he puff quick 

I'd rather grab the mic and concentrate on getting papes 

I'm out, and I'm still diggin' in the fucking crates

It's Lord Finesse  the rhyme vet 

Like Bigge  I'm ""Ready to Die"" but it ain't my fucking time yet 

I bring the noise like static  I cause havoc 

When I grab the mic I pack a party like traffic 

You know my style  I got the hip sound 

I should be a construction worker  the way I be tearing shit down 

One of the best  you ought to shout it 

Bust a nigga's ass and won't give two thoughts about it 

Word, I hunt you down 

I got a million reasons why none of you can fuck around 

I slay beginners, sautee contenders 

Shit, and be damned if I don't walk away the winner 

I kick facts, flip raps over hip tracks 

You know what I'm saying? (Yeah, I can dig that) 

I'm gifted, my rhyme is wicked 

When it comes to knowledge, I got jewels like the Diamond District 

I'm the dopest, the baddest, one of the fattest

I flow the same in a competition 

I break them clowns into something different, buck 'em with the fucking Smith & 

Wesson, MC's never leave my section 

Finger on the trigger, I figure I kill that nigga for stepping 

I tote the four-fifth, riff and get your jaw shift 

Flip phones and add jewels got me looking gorgeous 

Ignore the style and get bucked down, child 

With the three-pound pile, BLOW! How you like me now? 

The new improved Flow, you know how I do so 

Whatever, a motherfucking terror like Cujo 

I'm out to get mine, I want mils, God

It's D-Flow, you know my steelo, ceelo will let you know how we go 

Chop him like a kilo and let him die

And then I'm a add on like arithmetic 

Suckers careers get stopped so stop who you riffing with 

I'm on point with the snakes and fakes 

Ain't the one (Think I am?) You get hung like drapes 

And it's proven, point blank that's the conclusion 

Seeing me losing, it's all an illusion 

Like the raw ism, I'm a kiss him when I hurt him 

Then desert him, because the Show & A.G. shit is sickening 

Giving stress to them snakes is a ritual 

Nights and north flakes, oh yes, they bless the physical 

Promote the glock? No I'm not 

I use it as an art, ain't got the heart to disrespect hip-hop

Peace to K. Shabazz  while I get you open like a gash 

Pass the nickle if you think you can last 

MC's that slept got caught with the chin check 

Never slept cause them suckers could have been wet 

Now I'm here to bring use to my name 

Used to the slang  producer bang 

Give me room  cause what I consume makes me gloom 

To the man that I am  cause I am what I am 

Those who had soul was told to clap 

That was back, now it's '94 and I'm back 

With the Ghetto Dwellas, still rolling with my fellas 

With the herbs, I'm strutting, there's nothing you can tell us

Preview of the next LP, here's a smidgen 

Of the roughness, you know the ill off the cuffness 

You can't break it or bend it, cause the toughness 

Is manifested from my lyrical flow 

And niggas start sweating like they just did some blow 

Yo, dough is not a fuss 

I got the honeys running all night like the 21 bus 

Sally got a one track mind 

But now she got a black eye, cause she tried to take mine 

Another day in the hood 

Chilling with Show & A.G., Walli World, yo it's all good

Stalling, cause that roughness is all in me 

I rip ya, cause my rapture will rupture 

Check the richter, there's no rapper who's rougher 

Producer tougher than my man and his machine 

Don't sweat the cream, bet the green 

I'm on the humble, and not afraid to rumble 

With those who want to outlast the jungle, they tumble, I run through 

So build fences or come to your senses

Show Boat Pit Orchestra,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture,1946

And maybe, that's why I blow big dope on the daily
And maybe, I'll fuck ten more bitches and have ten more babies
And lately, I've been wanting to take shit back to the eighties
And maybe, I'll drive-by shooting at niggaz that hate me
See baby, you know my story and that's the way it still goes

Shoshot is sick wit it, gots nothing for ho's
but conversation and some dick wit it, can you dig it?
I'm a zipped down fool, and niggaz pause when I spit it
I might strip to my drawers, when I trip off the liquid

Hey, they love to see me move.
Me and my whole crew.
Cause every time I lean they watch spectators try to do it too.
So they keep on hesitating & hate, I put em in they place.
I call my boy Tookie then we whoop Rico in his face.
No time to conversate.
This ain?t the time or place. Watch me have to whoop a nigga ass
Like my name was Billy blanks.
This left a leave ya.
Then my dance, we crucial like brutality.
We leave y'all whole click stuck. Like we stole the damn scene.

[Trez]
They said em twice. Another third times a charm.
But why would you holla back, if a nigga in front of you ain?t no harm.
He tried to lean, he tried to rock, but he can?t do it quite like me.
Cause he keep doing the same ole move, constantly.
Now watch us kill this dance. Soon as we hit the flow.
Bout to get real crazy, don't turn yo head. We bout to start the show.
First you bend yo back, and lift yo head. Use yo hands and block yo head.
Roll yo arms and show yo swag. Now break his legs, arms, neck (yea).

She's as skinny as a stick of macaroni
Ought to see her rock 'n' roll with her blue jeans on
She's not very fat just skin and bone
But I love her, she loves me
All are happy now we can be
Making love underneath the apple tree
I told her mama and her papa too

Just exactly what I want to do
I want to get married on a night in June
And rock and roll by the light of a silvery moon
And I love her, she loves me
All are happy now we can be
Making love underneath the apple tree
She's my one and only, she's my heart's desire
She's a real upsetter, she's a real live wire
