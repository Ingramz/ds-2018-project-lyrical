Marc Bolan & T. Rex,"Lean love
All you give to me
Is lean love
I'm like a beggar in the sand
With the sky in his hand
And I'm blue

Black day
All you give to me
Are your wild ways
When you're the love of my life
And when you gorge me with a knife
And I'm blue

Lightening
All the heavy world
Is frightening
I'm like a child in the sand
On the beach of the land of you
And I'm blue
",Lean Woman Blues,1971
Marc Bolan & T. Rex,"I could have loved you, girl, like a planet
I could have chained your heart to a star
But it really doesn't matter at all
No it really doesn't matter at all
Life's a gas

I could have built a house on the ocean
I could have placed our love in the sky
But it really doesn't matter at all
No it really doesn't matter at all
Life's a gas

I could have turned you into a priestess
I could have burned your fate in the sand
But it really doesn't matter at all
No it really doesn't matter at all
Life's a gas

But it really doesn't matter at all
No it really doesn't matter at all
Life's a gas
I hope it's going to last

But it really doesn't matter at all
No it really doesn't matter at all

Marc Bolan & T. Rex,"Beneath the bebop moon
I want to croon - with you
Beneath the Mambo Sun
I got to be the one - with you.

My life's a shadowless horse
If I can't get across - to you
In the alligator rain
My hearts all pain - for you.

Girl, you're good
And I've got wild knees - for you
On a mountain range
I'm Dr. Strange - for you.

Upon a savage lake
Make no mistake - I love you
I got a powder-keg leg
and my wig's all pooped - for you.

With my hat in my hand
I'm a hungry man - for you
I got stars in my beard
and I feel real weird - for you.

Beneath the bebop moon
I'm howling like a loon - for you.
Beneath the mambo sun
I've got to be the one - for you.

Oh, take me!
Ah, yeah. Ah! 
Oh - please - come - oh woah.",Mambo Sun,1971

Marc Bolan & T. Rex,"In the moonlight
Fighting with the night
It's a rip-off
Kissing all the slain
I'm bleeding in the rain

It's a rip-off
Such a rip-off
Rocking in the nude
I'm feeling such a dude

It's a rip-off
Dancing in the dark
With the tramps in the park

It's a rip-off
Such a rip-off
See your baby's stud

Sliding in the mud
It's a rip-off
Bleached on the beach
I want to tickle your peach

It's a rip-off
Such a rip-off
See the girl dance
In her man-skin pants

It's a rip-off
Terraplane Tommy
Wants to bang your gong

It's a rip-off
Such a rip-off
Gypsy girl's good
People treat her like a fool

It's a rip-off
The President's weird
He's got a burgundy beard

It's a rip-off
Such a rip-off
I'm the King of the highway

I'm the Queen of the hop
You should see me
At the Governors ball
Doing the rip-off bop
I'm a social person

I'm the creature in disguise
There's a man with a whip

On his silver lip
Living inside my eyes
I'm the cat from the alley
I'm the fleetfoot vodoo man
There's very little that's ever said

All of which I understand
Caught like a skunk
In space and time
It's a rip-off
If it's her's

Well it must be mine
It's a rip-off
Such a rip-off",Rip Off,1971

And all the grown-ups
They put daggers there instead.

Goin' to take my baby on a Venus loon

Empty head, steel bed, Dipseys no good
All alone, no telephone, to hype up my baby,
Goin' to see my baby in the afternoon,
Goin' to take my baby on a Venus loon

Bent spent, psychedelic mailman's head,
Gorging up my spokes like the ghostly dead
Ally pally angel chewing up my blues,
Goin' to see my baby in the afternoon,
Goin' to take my baby on a Venus loon

It'll make you feel good

Oh my Venus loon it'll make you swoon,

Her nose is smashed her frame is bent
She's covered in flies
Everyone I ever loved, I'll love 'till I die

Girl you ain't nothin' but a raw ramp
You ain't nothin' but a raw ramp

Standin' on a corner by my old high school,
I let this female call me a fool
I got on my knees and begged to the sun
And I knew that my manhood had begun
Boogie on, electric boogie, boogie on
Embrace your brother, dance in the mud
Like a Palamino stud
Come along hold my hand.",Raw Ramp,2002

She's got luggage eyes and a roman nose
Her body is slung from side to side
Need a lift she said much obliged
I'm riding piggy-back
Then I came to her shack

We go inside the place it's a mess
She said my name's the liquid poetess
She unties her mouth
And her buckskin dress
She drinks from a bottle
Labelled tenderness
I'm in one hand in the other's a can

She puts me in the can
And smiles through the wall
I got the horror's 'cause I'm one inch tall
Next thing I know's a girl by my side
Dressed in a bayleaf she's trying to hide
I asked her name she said Germaine
Do the rock do the one inch rock.

Encore faible qui réclame

Soyez une pure flamme
Qui s'élève et qui proclame
La grandeur de votre amour""

Marc Broussard,"Why did it have to end so soon
Why did you go away
Although I know it may never come true
I hope to see you some day
And I'll always remember
Those times that we shared
So if you're listening from up above, this is my prayer

You brought so much joy to this world of mine
Whenever I needed you came
A friend like you is so hard to find
Without you it won't be the  same
And though many will try
No one can ever compare
So if you're listening from up above, this is my prayer

May the mountains rise to meet you
May the skies open wide
Know that in my heart, my friend
You will always be alive

There are so many things that I want you to know
So many words to say
And when he finally calls me home
I'll walk with you through those gates
So please remember me
Oh I promise I'll see you up there
I hope you're listening from up above, this is my prayer

May the mountains rise to meet you
May the skies open wide
Know that in my heart, my friend
You will always be alive

May the angels fly to greet you
You can see it all from up there
I know you're listening from up above
'cause this is and will always be my prayer
My prayer",Jeremiah's Prayer,2002
Marc Broussard,"I try to say the words, but they don't come out right

How could I bee so blind, how could I be such a fool?
'Cause in this game of love, there ain't no damn rules
That look in your eye's got my thinking something's wrong

I lived by luck and faith
I carried you inside of me
Prayed it wouldn't be too late
Now I'm standing on this empty road
Where nothing moves but the wind
And honey I just want to be


Back in your arms
Back in your arms again
Back in your arms
Back in your arms again

You said once I was your treasure
And I saw your face in every star
The promises we make at night
Oh that's all they are
Unless we fill them with faith and love
They're as empty as the howling wind
Now darling I just want to be



You came to me with love and kindness
But all my life I've been a prisoner of my own blindness
I met you with indifference
And I don't know why

Now I wake from my dream
I wake from my dream to this world
Where all this shadow and darkness is
And a dark sky unfurls
And all the love I've thrown away and lost
Honey I'm longing for again
Now there's nothing I wouldn't do if I could be

Back in your arms again
Back in your arms
Back in your armsâ?¦

Guitar packed in a trunk
Somewhere around mile marker 1-12,
Papa started hummin' the funk
I gotta jones in my bones before they know,
We were singing this melody
Stop the car pulled out the guitar,
Halfway to New Orleans

Said take me home
Take me home

Could feel the sun about to rise,
When I realized we had nothing to fear
It's just me and my daddy and a kid named Cope,
Making music that nobody would hear
And then the sun let up and it split the night,
Spillin' over our jubilee
Ten thousand cars by the side of the road,
Groovin' far as the eye can see

Said take me home
Take me home
Said take me home
Said take me home

This Greyhound is delta bound mama,
Baby boy finally found,
Said this Greyhound is delta bound mama,
Baby boy done finally found his way home
Said take me home

Here we go,
Hot damn you should have felt the groove,
Like I was swimming in a sea of soul
The sun was rising and the day was hot,
And we was all about to lose control
My daddy turned his face up towards the sky,
And I knew that there was nothing to lose
I felt the crowd breathe in and I closed my eyes,
And we disappeared into the groove

She's giving all she has but you still don't got the nerve
Settle down, stop running around with her heart, yeah
I should have told her I was trouble right from the start

Why should she wait till tomorrow
When she knows I'm not giving all I've got?
Why do I wait till tomorrow
When I want to be everything she needs today?

I want to be what she needs, oh

I've been wasting my time living fancy free
So many ways to spend my money on things for me
Like big gun and old guitars, nothing too much for me
She waits at home alone where I should be

Why should she wait till tomorrow
When she knows I'm not giving all I've got?
Why do I wait till tomorrow
When I want to be everything she needs today?

I'm gonna find my way, I'm going to tell the truth
Give me the strength to say, I need her always

Will she be here tomorrow
When she knows I'm not giving all I've got?
I'm not gonna wait till tomorrow
I want to be everything she needs

Why should she wait till tomorrow

Digging your heels will put you deep in a hole

Two down the hall
And when the going gets tough
I got a hole in the wall

29 ways just to make it to my baby's door
And if she needs me bad
I can find about two or three more

I can come through the chimney like Santa Claus
Go through the window and that ain't all

I even got a hole in the bedroom floor

29 ways to make it to my baby's door

A way through the attic that no one knows
A master key that fits every lock
A hidden door behind the grandfather clock

When there wasn't nothing but love to make,
They were two young lovers wishing on the stars above.

Well, they carved their initials in an old birch tree
With a heart and an arrow and a 'sixty-three.
You had to be blind not to see
It was a perfect love.

It was a perfect love.     
Ooh, yeah, yeah.
Well, they worked one summer together at the '64 World's Fair.
They met Robert Kennedy there.  
Well, that was
Right before the fall.

And they saved up a little bit of money for his career,
And they talked about the future underneath the giant sphere.
And all around them, the little voices were singing
It's a small world after all.  
Yes it is, small world after all.
And it was perfect love.

It was a perfect love.
Ooh, yeah, yeah.
(Under the moon and stars above it was a perfect love)

Now they were dizzy from dancing on Rockaway Beach. 
They came to Rockaway.
Yeah, and everything they dreamed of was still within reach
Dreaming, dreaming as the years roll by,
Like they always do.

Well, they had their share of hard times, too.
But whatever they were, they never let it get them down.

Now, they just go walking down a country lane;
See the leaves changing in the misty rain.
And only one thing remains the same, whoa.  Ooh, yeah, yeah.

Just a perfect love			
Ooh, yeah, yeah.

Was an Oriental man behind the wheel 
Started talking about heaven 
Like it was real 
Said ""They got mansions in heaven

And tell me that it ain't so

And you never have to listen 
To what these customers say and I know

I remember when I was a child 
Lost in the streets of Chinatown 
My mother had a vision and I was found 
(Saving the best for last for me)

And when I finally take this journey
I'm gonna wave goodbye to Earth 
Gonna throw this meter in the ocean

Marc Cohn,"Watched it coming up Winslow
Down South Park Boulevard
Yeah it was looking good from tail to hood
Great big fins and painted steel
Man it looked just like the Batmobile
With my old man behind the wheel

Well you could hardly even see him
In all of that chrome
The man with the plan and the pocket comb
But every night it carried him home
And I could hear him sayin'...

Don't gimme no Buick
Son you must take my word
If there's a God in heaven
He's got a Silver Thunderbird

You can keep your Eldorados
And the foreign car's absurd
Me I want to go down
In a Silver Thunderbird

He got up every morning
While i was still asleep
But I remember the sound of him shuffling around
Then right before the crack of dawn
I heard him turn the motor on
But when I got up they were gone

Down the road in the rain and snow
The man and his machine would go
Oh the secrets that old car would know
Sometimes I hear him sayin'...",Silver Thunderbird,1991

Might be the one they told you about

I'll take my trembling fingers
And I'll lift up your veil

Paper walls...ooh, yeah.

I closed the curtain, I shut the light,
I heard the highway moan.
Next thing I remember they were having a fight,
And then, she was all alone.
I heard her cry in the darkest hour,
I heard it echo in the hotel shower,
I heard her start packing her things, so,
I called her number and I heard it ring...

Right through the paper walls, paper walls,
Paper walls, ooh yeah, now.

I've never seen such a sight before,
The way she looked when she opened the door.
Hush now baby don't make a sound,
When all your love comes a-tumblin' down...

Just like a paper wall, paper wall,
Paper wall, ooh just like a paper wall.

It ain't the road that kills you, baby,
It's the all night calls
It ain't the road that kills you, baby,
It's just the paper walls",Paper Walls,1993
Marc Cohn,"Clouds move in 
From off the horizon 
Feels like nighttime 
In the middle of the day 
And I don't know why 
But it's still so suprisin' 
How a love grows stronger 
Or it just fades away

But you look older today 
Than I've ever seen you 
I think I know the reason 
We might wash all our tears away 
But you got to bundle up baby
For the rainy season

I hear you breathing heavy 
On the telephone tonight 
I can feel the air is thick as thieves 
Sometimes I just want to tell you 
We'll be all right
At least that's what some part of me believes

But you look older today 
Than I've ever seen you 
Think I know the reason 
We might wash all our tears away 
But you got to bundle up, bundle up, bundle up
For the rainy season

Marc Cohn,"My father was a working man 
But his work was never done 
He stood behind a counter 
And he smiled at everyone 
He bought himself a business 
Worked seven days a week 
Took a holiday for Christmas 
Then he fell asleep beside the tree 
But one day 

One day 
There's love for the lonely 
One day 
They walk in the sun 
One day 
Rest for the weary 
Rest for the weary ones 

Now my mother stood beside him 
She did what she could do 
But if you look at some old photograph
She looks tired too 
I hope there was some laughter 
Cause I know there were some tears
Now all I can say is I pray to God 
That after all those years

On another winding road 
I'm trying to walk some kind of line
I'm trying to pull some kind of load

Sometimes I can't catch my breath 
Sometimes I see my father's footsteps
And man it scares me half to death

Marc Cohn,"She runs down the staircase 
And into the yard 
And she goes down to the end of the drive
With her friends on the phone 
And her angels on guard 
She's just recently feeling alive 
After all of the tears and the changes 
Now there's something that's taken ahold
She's becoming gold 
She's becoming gold 

She thinks of a boy 
That she knew back in school 
And she wonders if he's doing all right 
The man of her dreams 
Isn't all that he seems 
And the baby don't sleep through the night
Something is moving inside her 
And the weather is turning so cold 
But she's becoming gold, 
She's becoming gold 
She's becoming gold (I've seen her) 
She's becoming gold 

She can hear in the distance 
The sound of the cars 
And she sees the snow falling down on the hill
Now the trees and the houses 
Are white as the stars 
And she doesn't want to cry 
But she probably will 
As she thinks about all of life's mystery 
And how slowly the answers unfold

Marc Cohn,"Don't know much about you 
Don't know who you are 
We've been doing fine without you 
But, we could only go so far 
Don't know why you chose us 
Were you watching from above 
Is there someone there that knows us 
Said we'd give you all our love 

Will you laugh just like your mother 
Will you sigh like your old man 
Will some things skip a generation 
Like I've heard they often can 
Are you a poet or a dancer 
A devil or a clown 
Or a strange new combination of 
The things we've handed down 

I wonder who you'll look like 
Will your hair fall down and curl 
Will you be a mama's boy 
Or daddy's little girl 
Will you be a sad reminder 
Of what's been lost along the way 
Maybe you can help me find her 
In the things you do and say 

And these things that we have given you 
They are not so easily found 
But you can thank us later 
For the things we've handed down 

You may not always be so grateful 
For the way that you were made 
Some feature of your father's 
That you'd gladly sell or trade 
And one day you may look at us 
And say that you were cursed 
But over time that line has been 
Extremely well rehearsed 
By our fathers, and their fathers

From places no one here remembers

Walk through this world?
Over the miles of mystery
Walk through this world with me

Over the mountains and the shining sea

Who knows what fear runs deep and wild
Inside
But the river's in flood tonight

I lay down and the light streamed across my face
I felt the beauty of some deeper grace

To find my way to the other side

I feel your skin as smooth as silk
Drunk like a baby on his mama's milk
Take me down under the wishing tree
Lay your healing hands on me

Of things that they remember well
Stories and faces dearly held

A couple in love livin' week to week
Rooms full of laughter
If these walls could speak

If these old halls, hallowed halls could talk
These would have a tale to tell
Of sun goin' down and dinner bell
And children playing at hide and seek from floor to rafter

If these halls could speak
They would tell you that I'm sorry
For bein' cold and blind and weak
They would tell you that it's only
That I have a stubborn streak
If these walls could speak

If these old fashioned window panes were eyes
I guess they would have seen it all
Each little tear and sigh and footfall
And every dream that we came to seek or followed after

Coming through my room
Breaking down the winter of my discontent
Looking out my window

At the people passing by
I keep wondering where my old companion went

On the steps of the museum
I wrote a line or two
But it took a while to find my way
Back to something true like

[Chorus]
This is where I lay my hat
This is where they know my name
This is where they show me that
A man's not so alone
Maybe I'm already home

Maybe I'm already home
(Sometimes you don't know why)

Rolling down the window
Burning up the daze
Cutting through the veil that keeps on blinding me
I was only sleeping
Waiting here for you
Waiting for your touch that keeps reminding me

Well I've seen the world of wonders
Been underneath it too
But it took a while just to find my way
Back to something true like

Marc Cohn,"I was driving down Ninth Avenue
As the sky was getting dark
Didn't have nothin' else to do
So I kept on riding to Battery Park

I stepped out in the damp and misty night
As the fog was rolling in
Man said, ""Last boat leaving tonight
Is the boat for Ellis Island""

As my feet touched solid ground
I felt a chill run down my spine
I could almost hear the sound
of thousands pushing through the lines

Mothers and bewildered wives
that sailed across the raging sea
Others running for their lives
to the land of opportunity
Down on Ellis Island

""What is this strange paradise?""
They must've wondered through their cries and moans
After all they've sacrificed
Their faith, their families, friends and homes

Then on the Inspection Stairs
They were counted out or counted in
Frozen while the inspectors stared
Down on Ellis Island

Now me I only stumbled in
Just to wander around that empty hall
Where someone else's fate had been
Decided in no time at all

And cases filled with hats and clothes
And the belongings of those who journeyed far
They're strange reminders I suppose
Of where we're from and who we are

But as the boat pulled off the shore
I could see the fog was lifting
And lights I never seen before
Were shining down on Ellis Island
Shining down on Ellis Island",Ellis Island,1998

But I could hardly hear your voice
Through the hissing of the highway
And all that other noise

Then you went riding up the coast

Seem to haunt me like a ghost

I lost you in the canyon
Guess you tried to let me know
Lost you in the canyon
A long, long time ago
Lost you in the canyon
Brother you fade out slow

There were times I thought I knew you
Before these changes came to pass
But you don't think about it do you?
From up there in your house of glass

The Earth is shifting underneath you
The land is sliding all around
Do you ever stop to wonder
About that paradise you've found?

Through the fires and the floods
But I can't fix this bad connection
In the wires or the blood

Was this house upon the hill
High above the great and mighty river
My hand could not hold the brushes
Yes I guess I lost my will
And you can't keep painting paradise forever
Oh forever

From the Andes to Niagara
To where we stand today
I drew the great creations of my master
'Til the oil and the canvas
Lord I threw them all away
And traded them for stone and brick and plaster
I traded them all for you

I traded them all for you
(Springtime come and the river want to run above the street)

She came to me one night
While I was tossing in my dreams
She said she'd give my family protection
I recall the night I died
Beneath her arches and her beams
I thanked her for the shelter and direction
I was lost until Olana

(Sun beat down on a summertime town -- he left me there)
I was lost until Olana
(Watching these hills turning gold for one more year)

Oh I've been from Jerusalem to Rome
Now I'm floating through these rooms tonight alone
And looking back on everything
All I ever wanted was a home

I was lost until Olana
How sweet the sound
How sweet the sound

Was this house upon the hill

In my mother's house

There must be some mistake""

This ship is sinking in the sea

And I tried to block it out
Then from somewhere deep inside me
Came a deathly chill

Saints preserve us
Wherever we might fall
This is all too big a mystery
I remember I was standing in the corner of the room
Saying ""Look at how she's leaving us
So quietly so soon""

I saw her reaching up her hands
Like she was asking to be taken high above us
Didn't she love us?

Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

On Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through

Isn't that so

Well I hope that I don't fall in love with you

Cause falling in love just makes me blue

Where the music plays a new display of hard for me to see

I head a beer and now I hear you calling out for me

And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

Now the night does funny things inside a man

These old tom cat feelings you don't understand

I turn around a look at you you light a cigarette

I wish I had the guts to bum one but we've never met

And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

I can see that you are lonesome just like me

And it being late you'd like some company well I've had two I look

At you and you look back

At me the guy you're with is up

And split that chair next to you is free

And I hope that you don't fall in love with me

Now it's closing time

The music's fadding out

Last call for drinks

I have another staff

I turn around and look at you

You're no where to be found

I search the place for your lost face

And have another round

And I think that I just fell in love with you

Sometimes she moans, sometimes she weeps
When the wind starts a howlin' out of control
She's trouble in mind, she's nothin' but soul

Now don't feel afraid there's nothin' to fear
It?s just strange visitations year after year
She gave me somethin' I needed but now the feeling is gone
And it?s high time I told her she's gonna have to move on

From the eerie lake to the hills that shake
I've been haunted on every coast
I might miss her I know but I'm letting it go
I'm givin' up the ghost, givin' up the ghost

Last night she came in at the usual time
Twelve is the number that the church bells did chime
But the wind didn't blow, there was barely a breeze
Just a light shinin' over the sycamore trees

From the eerie lake to the hills that shake
I've been haunted on every coast
I might miss her in know but I'm letting it go
I'm givin' up the ghost, givin' up the ghost

Now feelin' much better but I'm still on the brink
I just got a letter in vanishing ink

What this is all about 
Candles and champagne

To be perfect for you

For what I'm gonna do

And open you're heart to me

What everybody knows

To tell you what is real 
And let my feeling shows 
The whole world knows it's true

And in my eyes you'll see 
What everybody knows 

It seems like a lifetime

And from that first moment 
Deep in my heart I knew 
That someday I'll be 
Where I'm standing today 
Touching your body 
Kissing your face 
Holding the dreams 
That's finally coming true

It's you I crave

I crave your lips
I miss so much
The excitement of you kiss
But since your gone my heart won't behave
It's your love that I still crave

It may look like I'm happy but people who know me
Will know that I'm not doin' so well
I heard you've been dating
And though I've been waiting
I had found you and no one else (???)

Always turns me inside out how could we let it end

What are we all rushing for?
There is no escape from worry

That will dissipate into the air

Getting nowhere in a hurry,
Livin' should be so much more.
What's the point of all the hurry?

Look whatever comes right in the eye,

Can you tell?
My soul’s been taken apart
Empty and cold
Abandoned
A cast away heart

Gone with the tide
Floating adrift
Spirited away
Only a breath
Ships pass through me
Like evaporating spray

Apparition
Lost on a still ocean
Misty cloud
Barely a sound
My pale scattered light
Is fading white
Fading white

I won’t cry
I won’t miss
A home that wasn’t what it should be
Is there a place
A place to belong
Where love will recreate me?

Hope drains from my veins
Can’t numb the pain

I won’t be brought to my knees while you play the saint
You’re high on your denial passing me the blame
I’ll stitch my wounds with the burning needle of my pride
And mend myself from the inside

I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

Marc Johnson,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laurie,1996
Marc Johnson,"When troubles get me, cares beset me
And won't let me go,
I turn to you for consolation.
There I find new peace of mind;
To leave behind my woe
I turn to you as I shall always do.

[Chorus]
The touch of your lips upon my brow,
Your lips that are cool and sweet,
Such tenderness lies in their soft caress,
My heart forgets to beat.

The touch of your hands upon my head,
The love in your eyes a-shine,
And now, at last, that moment divine,
The touch of your lips on mine.

The touch of your hands upon my head,
The love in your eyes a-shine,
And now, at last, that moment divine,
The touch of your lips on mine.",Quiet Now,1996
Marc Johnson,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?

Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?

Their eyes looking coldly ahead
The two lonely people once loved and were caring
But now it's all over and dead
They don't know what happened
They can't think what happened
They had something fine on their own
But the two lonely people have turned into statues
Yes turned into statues of stone
The world was their moon once
The yellow ones
It held all their hopes and their dreams
But time came and broke them
Reality woke them
The world's not so pretty as it seems
For all that once mattered
Is old now and battered
But must it be shattered in two

Would give all their life

Down in the gutter life is slipping away

Burning down the bridges of my memory

Where they're downing only deer 
A hundred steel towns away

No never will I roam for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky 
I'll be sailing

Light it up, light it up
I can still feel the touch of your thin blue jeans
Running down the alley I've got my eyes all over you baby

So it goes, history shows, deserts must expand
Camels sail like wooden ships, like women down the strand
There's sand on second avenue and the wind blows like a train
Taxis line up like a string of pearls, around the block again

I remembered everything and every window pane
Every word came back to me and I was superman
But then I saw your face across the street
Through the tears of Hercules

There's a bus that leaves at 8:15 and another one at ten
Should I climb aboard, risk everything, and ride it to the end?
Watch the hills like roller coasters up against the sky
Wish that you were here by me, so close that I could die

You said love wrecks everything and none of us survive
But I got over you tonight inside this empty dive
Till I saw your face across the street
Through the tears of Hercules

I remembered everything and every window pane
Every word came back to me and I was superman again
Till I saw your face across the street
Through the tears of Hercules

Where there's despair, let me bring hope

Where there is blindness, let me bring sight
Where there is darkness, let me bring light

Grant that I may not so seek
To be heard but to hear
To be consoled but to console,
Not to be seen, but to see
To be loved but to love

Que ma tendresse et mon passé 
Des caresses, des promesses, des baisers 
Tu sais c'est terminé

Que mon espoir et mes pensées 
Les miroirs des mémoires déformés 
En nous se sont cassés

La chanson des feuilles mortes
Brumaire n'est pas coupable
De l'humeur qui m'accable me torture de la sorte

Passent les nuages ne demeure que le ciel
Mais cette larme sur mon visage est éternelle
Passent les nuages je les vois qui refluent
Mais cette l'arme comme ton image
Ne me quittera plus, ne me quittera plus

Certaines inclinaisons ne durent qu'une saison
Je le savais bien sûr mais le coup fait trop mal
Comme un pauvre animal
Je lèche mes blessures

Passent les nuages le dicton je le connais
Mais cette larme sur mon visage coule à jamais
Passent les nuages tes beaux yeux restent secs
Mais cette larme sera le gage de notre échec

Ce qui peut tourner mal, finit par tourner mal
C'est la loi de Murphy une triste règle dont
Nous ne feront pas l'exception
Et c'est pourquoi ma jolie

Passent les nuages le soleil point déjà
Mais cette larme sur mon visage ne sèchera pas
Passent les nuages et défilent les jours
Mais cette larme comme un tatouage
Restera toujours

Passent les nuages ne demeure que le ciel
Mais cette larme sur mon visage est éternelle
Passent les nuages je les vois qui refluent
Mais cette l'arme comme ton image
Ne me quittera plus, ne me quittera plus

1.
Quand le soleil descend à l'horizon,
A Saïgon...
Les Elégantes s'apprêt'nt et s'en vont
De leurs maisons...
A petits pas, à petits cris,
Au milieu des jardins fleuris,
Où volent les oiseaux jolis
Au paradis...
Tendrement enlacés,
Se grisant de baisers,
Les amants deux par deux,
Cherchent les coins ombreux.

Nuits de Chines,
Nuits câlines,
Nuits d'amour !
Nuits d'ivresses,
De tendresses,
Où l'on croit rêver jusqu'au lever du jour.
Nuits de Chine,
Nuits câlines,
Nuits d'amour !


2.
Sur la Rivière entendez-vous ces chants
Doux et charmants ?
Bateaux de fleurs ou les coupl's en dansant
Font des serments !
Pays de Rêve ou l'Étranger
Cherchant l'oubli de son passé,
Dans un sourire a retrouvé
La joie d'aimer...
Éperdu, le danseur
Croit au songe menteur,
Pour un soir de bonheur
On y laisse son coeur...

Mousmée jolie dont mon coeur est épris
Je veux l'oubli...
Puisque de toi mon amour infini
Reste incompris...
L'opium endort les malheureux
Et les emporte jusqu'aux cieux
Dans un nuage merveilleux
De fumée bleue...
Dans le soir qui s'enfuit,
Loin des chants, loin du bruit,
Sur la natte, endormi,
Le Beau Rêve a repris...

Je l'aimais tant, je l'aimais tant, je l'aimais tant

Elle rêvait d'Anna Karénine et de robes à crinoline
Là-haut, rue des Aubépines
Je n'étais pas sûr de moi, Dieu, que j'étais maladroit
En bas, rue des Acacias

Les années passaient doucement, on se regardait gentiment
Mais la neige et le mauvais vent chassent au loin les rêves d'enfants
On s'aimait tant, on s'aimait tant, on s'aimait tant

Elle s'est couchée dans le spleen d'un canapé bleu marine
Là-haut, rue des Aubépines
Moi, j'ai pleuré plus que moi, glacé de peine et d'effroi
En bas, rue des Acacias

Elle avait peut-être vingt ans, je m'en souviens de temps en temps
Mais jamais ne revient le temps qui chasse au loin tout, tout l'temps
Je l'aimais tant, je l'aimais tant, je l'aimais tant

Elle n'était pas ma voisine, elle vivait dans les collines
Là-haut, rue des Aubépines
Je n'étais pas fier-à-bras et chez nous il faisait froid

Marc Lavoine,"Oui l'amour est mal coiffé,
L'amour non identifiée,
L'amour est un clandestin,

Si l'amour est voyageur,
L'amour pousse à l'intérieur
Et l'amour à toujours faim,

L'amour est mystérieux,
L'amour c'est un malheureux
Mais l'amour est un héros,

L'amour est insaisissable
Même si l'amour est cassable,
L'amour à ça dans la peau.

J'ai vu la lumière
En passant par là,
Elle était si belle
Qu'elle m'a conduit chez toi

L'amour est couché par terre,
L'amour c'est un appel d'air,
L'amour est un évadé

L'amour un jour fiche le camp
Un jour l'amour te reprend,
L'amour c'est un habitué,

Que l'amour est volatil,
L'amour fait son difficile,
L'amour est un beau parleur,

L'amour nous fait ses aveux,
Mais l'amour fait ce qu'il ce veut
Comme il brisera ton cœur

J'ai vu la lumière
En passant par là,
Elle était si belle
Qu'elle m'a conduit chez toi

J'ai vu la lumière
En passant par là
Elle était si belle
Qu'elle s'est jetée sur moi

C'est comme un point de non retour,
On peut s'y perdre pour toujours,

L'amour peut devenir fou,
L'amour s'accroche à ton cou,
L'amour a le diable au corps

Car l'amour est dangereux,
L'amour c'est un ange heureux
Qui n'a pas peur de la mort,

L'amour n'est pas invincible
Mais quand il te prend pour cible,
L'amour est plus fort que toi,

L'amour couche avec la vie,
L'amour défait tous les lits,
Il aura raison de moi

J'ai vu la lumière
En passant par là
Elle était si belle
Qu'elle m'a conduit chez toi

J'ai vu la lumière
En passant par là
Elle était si belle
Qu'elle s'est jetée sur moi

Qu'elle s'est jetée sur moi",J'ai Vu la Lumiere,2012

Marc Lavoine,"Le temps perdu je le connais 
Il a la gueule de mes regrets 
Il a du soleil dans les yeux 
Du sable blanc dans les cheveux 
Le temps perdu je l’ai laissé 
Sur une chaise dans un café 
Sur une photo il me sourit 
Nous étions beaux et bons amis 
Le temps perdu se moque de moi 
Il se fout bien de mes migraines 
Il fiche le camp sans état d’âme 
Il garde son sang-froid sans larmes 
Sans larmes 
On se quitte un jour comme on s’est aimés 
Pour les raisons mêmes qui nous ont unis 
Pour la différence, pour la liberté, ce qui nous a plu 
Un jour on ne va plus 
On ne s’aime plus 

Le temps perdu frappe à la porte 
Des souvenirs dans le grenier 
De ma boîte crânienne venteuse 
De mes ruptures amoureuses 
Le temps perdu c’est un roman 
Dont les pages volent dans le vent 
Une histoire qu’on jette sous un pont 
Dans la rivière des sanglots longs 
Le temps perdu est un voyou 
Un détrousseur de grands chemins 
Voleur de rêves, faiseur de trous 
Accompagnateur de chagrins
De chagrins

Marc Lavoine,"Les journées se faufilent, on se perd dans les rues 
On nage dans les eaux troubles où nous n’avons plus pied 
Dans les ""ainsi soit-il"" des grandes avenues 
On se noie dans la foule des amours naufragés 
Et les automobiles éperdument se ruent 
À en perdre la boule dans les artères bouchées 
Je me cherche un exil tu te cherches un salut 
Au milieu de la houle, une planche, une brume 
Comment allez-vous? 
Comment allez-vous? 
Comment allez-vous? 
Comment allez-vous? 

Les cachets d’gélatine qu’on avale résignés 
Pour supporter le spleen de nos corps complexés 
Du sport à la machine pour se photoshoper 
Montrer bonne figure sur nos autoportraits 
Les grèves qui défilent, les vitrines brisées 
Les cocktail Molotov sont presque démodés 
Les attentats suicides font partis du planning 
Les honneurs sont posthumes les héros fatigués 
Comment allez-vous? 
Comment allez-vous? 
Comment allez-vous? 
Comment allez-vous? 

Soudain je te regarde et soudain tu me vois 
D’avoir le cœur qui bat on est presque étonné 
Devant les abattoirs sur le quai de la gare 
Sur les champs de bataille de nos Champs-Elysées 
Un espoir revenu dans nos yeux incrédules 
Un rêve que l’on croyait à jamais disparu 
Un sentiment peut-être, est-ce la pleine lune? 
Les premiers mots d’amour nous font un drôle d’effet

Maybe it was the mood I was in or maybe it was really you, really you.

This heart of mine was doing very well.
The world was fine as far as I could tell.
And then quite suddenly I saw you, and I dreamed of gay amor.
At dawn I'll wake up singing sentimental overtures.

This heart of mine is gayly dancing now.
I taste the wine of real romancing now.
Somehow this crazy world has taken on a wonderful design.
As long as life endures, it's yours this heart of mine.

Watch your fist curl against the sheet
Watch your lips fall open and your eyes dim

Ou qui ne vivent pas c'est selon la saison
Ce sont de drôl's de typ's qui traversent la brume
Avec des pas d'oiseaux sous l'aile des chansons

Leur âme est en carafe sous les ponts de la Seine
Leurs sous dans les bouquins qu'ils n'ont jamais vendus
Leur femm' est quelque part au bout d'une rengaine
Qui nous parle d'amour et de fruit défendu

Ils mettent des couleurs sur le gris des pavés
Quand ils marchent dessus ils se croient sur la mer
Ils mettent des rubans autour de l'alphabet
Et sortent dans la rue leurs mots pour prendre l'air

Ils ont des chiens parfois compagnons de misère
Et qui lèchent leurs mains de plume et d'amitié
Avec dans le museau la fidèle lumière
Qui les conduit vers les pays d'absurdité

Ce sont de drôl's de typ's qui regardent les fleurs
Et qui voient dans leurs plis des sourires de femme
Ce sont de drôl's de typ's qui chantent le malheur
Sur les pianos du coeur et les violons de l'âme

Leurs bras tout déplumés se souviennent des ailes
Que la littérature accrochera plus tard
A leur spectre gelé au-dessus des poubelles
Où remourront leurs vers comme un effet de l'Art

lls marchent dans l'azur la tête dans les villes
Et savent s'arrêter pour bénir les chevaux
Ils marchent dans l'horreur la tête dans des îles
Où n'abordent jamais les âmes des bourreaux

Ils ont des paradis que l'on dit d'artifice
Et l'on met en prison leurs quatrains de dix sous

I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love,1995
Marc Ribot,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

Marc Ribot,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1995
Marc Ribot,"Standing on the corner
Just me and Yoko Ono

Played the Fillmore and Apollo for freedom
Tried to shake our image

The most beautiful thing you can ever spend
But you work in a shirt with your name tag on it
Drifting apart like a plate tectonic

It don't matter to me
'Cause all I wanted to be
Was a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar

Too much time spent dragging the past up
I didn't see you not looking when I messed up
Settling down in your early twenties
Sucked more blood than a backstreet dentist

It don't matter to me
'Cause all I wanted to be
Is a million miles from here

In the silly Middle East
No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus
They have different religious beliefs

They believe in Muhammad
And not in our holiday
And so every December
I go to the Middle East and say

""Hey there Mr. Muslim
Merry fucking Christmas
Put down that book the Koran
And hear some holiday wishes.

In case you haven't noticed
It's Jesus's birthday.
So get off your heathen Muslim ass
and fucking celebrate.

There is no holiday season in India I've heard
They don't hang up their stockings
And that is just absurd!

They've never read a Christmas story.
They don't know what Rudolph is about
And that is why in December
I'll go to India and shout

Hey there Mr. Hinduist
Merry fucking Christmas
Drink eggnog and eat some beef
And pass it to the missus.

In case you haven't noticed
It's Jesus's birthday
So get off your heathen Hindu ass

Everyone just lives in sin
They pray to several gods
And put needles in their skin.

On December 25th
All they do is eat a cake
And that is why I go to Japan
And walk around and say

When Angel Gabriel appeared.
He said, ""you are to be the virgin mother,""
And Mary thought that was weird.

But then, Gabriel said to Mary,
""My child, have no fear:

And still be a Virgin, Mary.
[You can suck all the dick you want,]
And still not be considered flawed.
[Though, Mary, you went to town,
and sucked some semen down,]
You're still still a virgin
In the eyes of god!""

There was no room at the Inn
When Mary and Joseph did arrive.
They were so very tired, you see,
[and Mary had to offer him a bribe.]
Said she had no money,
[and they had no place to sleep.]
Gabriel appeared to Mary,
And told her not to weep.

[""'Cause you can suck all the dick you want]
And still be a Virgin, Mary.

Bearing gifts of myrrh and such.
They said that they had followed a star,
And missed a woman's touch.
[Mary thought that she might pleasure them,
But could not take them to bed.]
But, again, Gabriel appeared to her
And this is what he said

[""You can suck all the dick you want,]
And still be a Virgin, Mary.
[You can suck all the dick you want,]
Everyone in the nation.
[Fellatio ain't no sin,
So go and blow those three wise men!]
And you'll still be a virgin,
['Cause there ain't no penetration!""]

[You can suck all the dick you want,]
And still be a Virgin, Mary!
[The donkey, or the ox and the lamb]
And even the little drummer boy.
Folks will remember your name quick!
[They'll say, ""Damn, that bitch can suck a dick""!]
['Cause sucking dick]
Brings peace on earth and joy.
['Cause sucking dick]
Brings peace on earth and joy.

[Mary, you can suck my dick!]",The Most Offensive Song Ever,1999

Marc Shaiman,"Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose

When you kiss me, Heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose

When you press me to your heart
And in a world apart
A world where roses bloom

And when you speak 
Angels sing from above
Every day words 
Seems to turn into love songs

Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be

Marc Shulman,"My name is Calypso
And I have lived alone
I live on an island 
And I waken to the dawn
A long time ago
I watched him struggle with the sea
I knew that he was drowning
And I brought him into me
Now today
Come morning light
He sails away
After one last night
I let him go.

My name is Calypso
My garden overflows
Thick and wild and hidden
Is the sweetness there that grows
My hair it blows long
As I sing into the wind
My name is Calypso
And I have lived alone
I live on an island
I tell of nights
Where I could taste the salt on his skin

Salt of the waves
And of tears
And though he,pulled away
I kept him here for years
I let him go

My name is Calypso
I have let him go
In the dawn he sails away
To be gone forever more
And the waves will take him in again
But he'll know their ways now
I will stand upon the shore
With a clean heart

And my song in the wind
The sand will sting my feet
And the sky will burn
It's a lonely time ahead
I do not ask him to return
I let him go
I let him go",Calypso,2002

There was nobody else around
Too bad, her mom and dad were out of town

We were watchin' Winter Wonderland
When she grabbed my hand and said

I was thinkin' maybe you should stay the night""

It's all there, it's a done deal
It's a looks good, it's for real
Flyin' high in a first-class seat
With the magic carpet under my feet

It's all that and a bag of chips
Right on par, it's the whole nine yards
A symmetrical equation, it's a perfect situation

Well, wouldn't you know I was sittin' in the front row?
Watchin' a Shania Twain
She reached down and she pulled me up
On stage and sang 'You Win My Love'

Then she passed the mic to me, I started singin'
And the crowd went crazy from the very first note
I signed a record deal and that was all she wrote
I was so stoked

It's all there, it's a done deal
It's a looks good, it's for real
Flyin' high in a first-class seat
With the magic carpet under my feet

Life don't get any better than this
It's all that and a bag of chips
Right on par, it's the whole nine yards
A symmetrical equation, it's a perfect situation

And I'm here to tell you, it don't get any better
It's a perfect situation, right down to the letter
And I'm here to tell you, it don't get any better
It's a perfect situation, right down to the letter

And I'm here to tell you, it don't get any better
It's a perfect situation, right down to the letter

It's all there, it's a done deal
It's a looks good, it's for real
Flyin' high in a first-class seat
With the magic carpet under my feet

Life don't get any better than this
It's all that and a bag of chips
Right on par, it's the whole nine yards
A symmetrical equation, it's a perfect situation

And I'm here to tell you, it don't get any better
It's a perfect situation, right down to the letter

Marcel,"Every morning when the sun comes up
On the east side, I catch a buzz
Lying next to you, roll over, and kiss your cheek
Just because
And the paper comes we pour a cup of Joe
Hey baby, there's something I want you to know

If you need a hand, hold on
I'll be there beside you
If you stumble, I won't let you fall
I'll be right behind you

If you find you're losing your way
I'll be the one to guide you home
You're not alone
I'm behind the sunshine and in the wind that blows
I'm your shadow

Na na na na
Na na na na na, na na

When the sun goes down, what a sight
I thank you, girl, for bein' part of my life
Then we order take-out, turn on the tube
I rub your back because I want to
Then we wash our faces and brush our teeth
Time to go to bed, but even in your dream

If you need a hand, hold on, I'll be there beside you
If you stumble, I won't let you fall, I'll be right behind you

If you find you're losing your way
I'll be the one to guide you home
You're not alone
I'm behind the sunshine
And in the wind that blows
I'm your shadow, your shadow

Marcel,"Third grade, bell rings
Kamikazes on the playground swings
We teeter-tottered
And played on the merry-go-round
She had it tough, she didn't have much
I said, ""Come on over you can share my stuff""

Here's my G.I. Joe, my comic book
My grandpa's collection of fishing hooks
My wiffle ball bat, my Dodgers baseball cap

I was failin' 'til she helped me pass
She cheered me on

She had torn jeans and worn out shoes
I said, ""What's mine is yours to use""

Here's my letter jacket, my high school ring
My locker combination, you can take anything
My autographed picture of Johnny Cash
And if you like rock 'n' roll, then here take these

A few years later we were closer than ever
Spendin' more and more time together
I took her down to the Stony Creek river
Somethin' more that I had to give her
Here's

The key to my house, now it's your house too
Here's some wild flowers that I picked for you
A bottle of wine, it's been aging since '69
Here's a diamond ring my grandma wore

All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

Marcel Azzola,"Y'a tout à l'heure, quinze ans d'malheur, mon vieux Léon
Que tu es parti au paradis d'l'accordéon
Parti bon train, voir si l'bastringue et la java
Avaient gardé droit de cité chez Jéhovah
Quinze ans bientôt qu'musique au dos, tu t'en allais
Mener le bal à l'amicale des feux follets
En cet asile, par Sainte-Cécile, pardonne-nous
De n'avoir pas su faire cas de ton biniou

C'est une erreur mais les joueurs d'accordéon
Au grand jamais, on ne les met au Panthéon
Mon vieux, tu as dû t'contener du champ de navets
Sans grandes pompes et sans pompons et sans ave
Mais les copains suivaient l'sapin, le cœur serré
En rigolant, pour faire semblant de n'pas pleurer
Et dans nos cœurs, pauvre joueur d'accordéon
Il fait ma foi, beaucoup moins froid qu'au Panthéon

Depuis mon vieux, qu'au fond des cieux, tu as fait ton trou
Il a coulé de l'eau sous les ponts de chez nous
Les bons enfants d'la rue de Vanves à la Gaîté
L'un comme l'autre, au gré des flots, furent emportés
Mais aucun d'eux n'a fait fi de son temps jadis
Tous sont restés du parti des myosotis
Tous ces pierrots ont le cœur gros, mon vieux Léon
En entendant le moindre chant d'accordéon

Quel temps fait-il chez les gentils de l'au-delà 
Les musiciens ont-ils enfin trouvé le la 
Et le p'tit bleu, est-c'que ça n'le rend pas meilleur
D'être servi au sein des vignes du Seigneur 
Si d'temps en temps, une dame d'antan s'laisse embrasser
Sûrement papa, que tu regrettes pas d'être passé
Et si l'bon Dieu aime tant soit peu l'accordéon

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is

If I could just get away 
With my man

I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

Comme il me reste à vous prouver comment,
Je vais commencer par le commenc'ment.

Un maçon
Chantait une chanson
Là-haut sur le toit d'une maison,
Et la voix de l'homme s'envola
Pour se poser par là
Comme un oiseau sur la
Voix d'un autre maçon
Qui reprit la chanson
Sur le toit voisin de la maison
Et ainsi commença l'unisson
De deux maçons et d'une chanson ! son ! sons !

De maçon en maçon,
De pignon en pignon
Et de rue en ville et en village,
La chanson prit son vol,
Et dans sa course folle
Accrocha tous les échafaudages.

Parce que dans le pays tout entier

Refrain :

Mill' maçons
Chantaient une chanson
Tout là-haut sur le toit des maisons
Ça leur donnait du coeur au boulot
Les matériaux
Tout seuls !
Semblaient monter tout seuls !
Et les maisons
Poussaient comme des champignons
Ça faisait la joie des compagnons
Qui chantaient avec tous les maçons
Tout là-haut, sur le toit des maisons.

De chantier en chantier
Tous les corps de métier
Travaillaient et chantaient en cadence.
Le soleil dans le ciel
Trouva tout naturel
De rentrer à son tour dans la danse.

Vous n'en ferez que ce que vous voudrez :

Si tout l' mond' chantait comm' les maçons
Si chacun apportait son moëllon,
Nous rebâtirions notre maison
Qui deviendrait, Bon Dieu !

Once again there comes to mind

Marcel Jiteau,"Il est venu pour la moisson.
C'était un fort et beau garçon
Aux yeux câlins, aux lèvres dures.
Tout en moissonnant, il chantait
Et, dans sa voix, l'on entendait
Toutes les voix de la nature.
Il a chanté le clair printemps,
Les oiseaux, les prés éclatants,
Les taillis verts, les fleurs nouvelles.
Le soir, pour les gens rassemblés,
Il a dit la chanson des blés
Dans la fausse courbe des Javelles.

Il a chanté.
Les moissonneurs l'ont écouté
Et la maîtresse aussi l'écoute.
Il a chanté
Puis il a dit ""A ma santé!
Et demain, je reprends la route""
Quand tout dormait, vers la minuit,
Comme il allait partir sans bruit,
La femme du maître est venue,
Toute pâle et le cœur battant
Et belle de désir pourtant
Et sous sa mante presque nue.
Elle a dit: ""C'est toi que j'attends,
Depuis des jours, depuis des ans.
Qu'importe une existence brève.
Reste auprès de moi jusqu'au jour
Chante-moi la chanson d'amour
Et que je vive enfin mon rêve!""

Il a chanté.
Les yeux clos, elle a écouté
Sa douce voix qui la prend toute.
Il a chanté
L'amour, la mort, la volupté
Et, tous deux, ils ont pris la route.

Ils sont partis le lendemain.
Elle a connu l'âpre chemin,
La faim, le travail, la tristesse
Car son amant, vite lassé,
Sans un regret pour le passé,
A caressé d'autres maîtresses.
N'en pouvant plus d'avoir souffert,
Après des nuits, des jours d'enfer
Elle a dit, la pauvre amoureuse
""Bien-aimé, n'aie point de remords.
Chante-moi la chanson des morts
Et laisse-moi, je suis heureuse""

Marcel Louiguy,"Des yeux qui font baisser les miens
Un rire qui se perd sur sa bouche
Voilà le portrait sans retouches
De l'homme auquel j'appartiens

Quand il me prend dans ses bras
Il me parle tout bas
Je vois la vie en rose

Il me dit des mots d'amour
Des mots de tous les jours
Et ça me fait quelque chose

Il est entré dans mon cœur
Une part de bonheur
Dont je connais la cause

C'est lui pour moi, moi pour lui dans la vie
Il me l'a dit, l'a juré pour la vie

Alors je sens en moi

Des ennuis, des chagrins s'effacent
Heureux, heureux à en mourir

Marcel Mouloudji,"Le long des rues de Paris, de Paris si jolie 
Mon enfance traine le jour et la nuit
Le long des rues de Paris de Paris où je vis
Mon enfance pleure le jour et la Nuit
Je revois l’enfant blême au canal Saint-Martin
Voler tout ce qui traîne à portée de ses mains
Et au Faubourg du Temple avide de gros sous
Vendre bananes, oranges  pourries pour de gros sous

Le long des rues de Paris, de Paris si jolie
Ma jeunesse se traine le jour et la nuit
Le long des rues de Paris, de Paris où je vis
Ma jeunesse se pleure le jour et la nuit
J’ai trainé les pavés sous la pluie de la guerre
J’ai connu les naguères 
Où mes amis sont restés amoureux des étoiles
Des filles et des cœurs
J’ai casé ma fringale au galet de bonheur

Está la luna tan llena

he de cambiar mi destino

está sonriente why serena

ella está aquí, aquí conmigo.

Hay un caudal que me lleva

why no eres tú quien domina el río

así es que déjalo ir donde quiera

tampoco yo al río domino.

Marcela Morelo,"Fui recorriendo caminos
Metiéndome en líos de amores
Que voy a guardar
Hasta quedarme sola

Sin pena, ni gloria
Sin saber que iba a pasar
Y ahora que estoy en tus brazos
Amándonos tanto

Quiero agradecerle a Dios
""No le temo a la verdad""
""Creo solo en el amor""

Si mis palabras te hieren
No es mi intención
No quiero causarte dolor
Voy entendiendo las cosas de a poco

Y de a poco te voy conociendo mejor
Cada pensamiento malo trato de matarlo
Y cambiarlo por uno mejor
""No le temo a la verdad""
""Creo solo en el amor""

Ven y abrázame
Piel a piel mi amor
Abrázame bajo el sol

Aunque a veces uno es débil
Y trata a la vida
Como no debiera tratar
Se va tejiendo la historia

Y queda en la memoria
Cada día que ha de pasar
Vivo pensando en tus besos

En tus ojos negros
Que me alivian todo dolor
Te repito que es verdad
""Creo solo en el amor""

Ven y abrázame
Piel a piel mi amor
Abrázame bajo el sol

Ven, ven, abrázame fuerte
Ven, ven, abrázame

But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,

No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,

Marcella Woods,"And by the moonlight flow visions born from darkness
The answer shall now be found
And by the moonlight
All will be revealed, wisdom of the ages falls like rain
I am of the future, take my fire and release your flame

And so I leave this world, never to return
My candle has been burned, for deliverance I yearn
Time cannot erase the mark I leave on time and space
Sanctuary burns, raging grace

I will live on, pure energy and perfect knowledge
The eye of the storm, judgment now awaits for me
Am I born to darkness or to light?

I'm flying to the sun, wings are stained with blood
My journey has begun, am I blessed or am I damned
Years will melt away, my mortal shell left to decay
The sanctuary learns your love and hate

I will live on, pure energy and perfect knowledge
The eye of the storm, judgment now awaits for me
Am I born to darkness or to light?

And so I leave this world, never to return
I am the new life form, I have seen and you will learn
Time cannot erase, my passage through this sacred place

Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Marcelo D2,"1967, o mundo começou pelo menos pra mim
E a minha história reduzida é mais ou menos assim
Nascido em São Cristóvão, morador de Madureira
Desde pequeno acostumado a subir ladeira
Me lembro muito bem dos meus tempos de moleque
Que sempre passava as férias no final do 77

Padre Miguel sempre dez na bateria
Saudoso Mestre André, sempre soube o que queria
Futebol na rua F ou no campo de baixo
Você sabe, meu tio gentil era um esculacho
Andava pelas ruas vestindo o meu bate bola
Se tu passasse em minha frente era melhor tu sair fora

Carnaval de rua, perigoso e divertido
Mas passei por tudo isso entre mortos e feridos
Graças ao meu pai, o pessoal da tramela
Sérgio Cabrito, meu padrinho não dava trégua
Lembra do Cassino Bangu, de vez em quando eu ia lá
Curtir um funk, ver a mulherada rebolar
Kool and the Gang, Gap Band
Outro mestre, James Brown
Era só alegria, não tinha pau

Eu quero ver se tu é homem, mané
Do jeito que eu fui e que eu sou
Eu quero ver se tu é homem, mané
Que nem a parteira falou

No Andaraí, Grajaú o bicho pegava mais
Quando pichava muro sempre tinha um correndo atrás
Carlos Peixe, meu camarada
De vez em quando no piche, outras na baforada
Vida de moleque sempre sangue bom
Calote no ônibus pra ir à praia no verão

Pra ficar um pouco mais roubava no supermercado
Foda-se, pra mim isso nunca foi pecado
Sempre no Maraca vendo o Mengão jogar
Zico, Adílio, Júnior, fazendo a bola rolar
Como já dizia o hino, vou repetir com vocês
Uma vez Flamengo, Flamengo até morrer

Meu avô Peixoto deixou meu sangue rubro-negro
Me orgulho de ser carioca, me orgulho de ser brasileiro
Skate na veia, só quem tem sabe como é que é a sensação
E o poder de dar um ollie-air
Campo Grande, Norte Shopping, Street no Méier
À noite Circo Voador, show do De Falla e um Domec

Vender Camisa na 13 de Maio
Na situação show no Garage
Skunk, diversão de irmão
Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaata, Planet Rock
Rap, break, graffiti
Chegou o hip hop
Cantando a vida mas vista de um outro lado
Não é apologia, cumpadi, não adianta ficar bolado

Entenda se a minha rima não te faz rir
Não é apologia parceiro, da licença, sai daqui
Eu vim pra zoar, fazer barulho
Falar um pouco de mulher
Skate, som, bagulho
Sempre ligado, sempre sabendo o que quer
Sempre bom da cabeça, nunca doente do pé
Eu vou levando a vida
É, juro que vou
Só no sapato, sempre sendo o que sou

Eu quero ver se tu é homem, mané
Do jeito que eu fui e que eu sou
Eu quero ver se tu é homem mané

Problemas passam como um clipe
Armas e brinquedos
Se confundem na mão de uma criança

É que eu vim da zona norte

De gente honesta e humilde
Mas gente nobre
Você tem que andar na linha
Se manter no povo
Não se assuste esse é só o começo do jogo

Não dá nem tempo de pensar no que fazer

Respeito a quem sobrevive a isso tudo
E não precisa mais temer o mundo
Debaixo dos planos
Ta no orgulho suburbano

Um pouco de africano

Ah! Puro blá blá blá!

O que eu preciso é me focar no meu trabalho
Me focar na minha família
Que ai o meu sucesso vem!
Rema rema
E não sabe o que quer
Pra quem não sabe que caminho vai, pega um qualquer!
Me diz ai!
Vai ficar sentado no gueto
Ou vamo ser parte de algo e escrever o enredo?

Marcelo D2,"É melhor ser alegre que ser triste
Alegria é a melhor coisa que existe
É assim como a luz no coração

Mas prá fazer um samba com beleza
É preciso um bocado de tristeza
Senão não se faz um samba não

Fazer samba não é contar piada
E quem faz samba assim não é de nada
O bom samba é uma forma de oração

Porque o samba é a tristeza que balança
E a tristeza tem sempre uma esperança
De um dia não ser mais triste não

Põe um pouco de amor numa cadência
E vai ver que ninguém no mundo vence
A beleza que tem um samba não

Porque o samba nasceu lá na Bahia
E se hoje ele é branco na poesia
Ele é negro demais no coração

É melhor ser alegre que ser triste
Alegria é a melhor coisa que existe
É assim como a luz no coração

Porque o samba nasceu lá na Bahia
E se hoje ele é branco na poesia
Ele é negro demais no coração

why comprender que todo fue un mal sueÃ±o que ya estÃ¡.

corriendo por la vida siempre a mil,

Will they catch your sight

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Lose their taste for kissing?
