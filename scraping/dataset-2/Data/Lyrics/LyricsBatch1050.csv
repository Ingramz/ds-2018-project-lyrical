Steve Miller Band,"I've been digging something up 
Bet you thought I've been sleeping 
Having trouble waking up 
It's just the hours I've been keeping 

Up in this attic all alone 
The situation's unnerving 
And while the candle's going out 
Each weathered page I keep turning 
Looking back, fundamental romance 
Some are still around 
Some went underground 

Criticize all the letters I find in this tattered book 
Please take a look 
The things I told you I never told anyone 
And all this time you knew 
You'd always be my only one 

I've been looking something up 
It always seems to amaze me 
That's just the way we used to dance 
You never thought it was crazy 
The things I told you I never told anyone 
And all this time you knew 
You'd always be my only one 
Just you 

The things I told you I never told anyone 
And all this time you knew 
You'd always be my only one 
It always seems to amaze me 
You never thought it was crazy 

Looking back, fundamental romance, campus Romeo 
But only you would know 
I realize that you've waited so long for the cards to fall 
And after all 
The things I told you I never told anyone 
And all this time you knew you'd always be my only one 
The things I told you I never told anyone 
And all this time you knew you'd always be my only one

",Things I Told You,1982
Steve Miller Band,"I left my message on your number 
In hopes that you might call 
Riding high on good intentions 
Still hanging on the wall 
Although my words were never all too 
Clear it's understood 
It's never too late to say in other ways 
Something in our lives we'll rearrange 
More than just your call on holiday 

Ring me up, don't bring me down 
Don't let me hear you won't 
Come through tonight 
Ring me up, don't bring me down 
You know this lonely heart stands by me 
While I'm waiting 

Remembering how it came together 
The meaning in your eyes 
Now words fall out like perfect strangers 
We both apologize 
In all this time I thought I knew you 
And over looked somehow the reasons why 
You kept inside 

Ring me up, don't bring me down 
Don't let me hear you won't 
Come through tonight 
This lonely heart stands by me 
While I'm waiting 

Ring me up, don't bring me down 
Don't let me hear you won't 
Come through tonight 

Ring me up, don't bring me down 
Here's hoping the days gone by we'll see again 
This lonely heart stands by and I'm still waiting 
Ooh still waiting 
Ooh still waiting 


",While I'm Waiting,1982
Steve Miller Band,"I see you jaded like a debutante 
Things your image never shows 
There's something hiding deep inside of you 
Something that I'll never know 
Then I saw you on the streets alone 
Had you paged on the corner phone 
The words just kept me straining to express 
You're hard to break and you still ache 

Like a young girl, like a young girl's heart 
Like a young girl, just like a young girl's heart 

I stand here waiting in my lily white 
Scan the lines you'll be famous for 
Then we'll talk about what's good and what's bad 
Romantic moves we won't have to score 
Like you were saying what you really want 
Ah, it's funny you should ask me now 
It was all right there in the story I just read 
I'm hard to break and you still ache 

Like a young girl, like a young girl's heart 
Like a young girl, just like a young girl's heart 
Like a young girl, just like a young girl's heart 
Like a young girl, like a young girl's heart 
Just like a young girl, like a young girl's heart 
Like a young girl, just like a young girl's heart 
Like a young girl, like a young girl's heart 
Like a young girl, just like a young girl's heart 
Like a young girl, like a young girl's heart 
Just like a young girl's heart

",Golden Opportunity,1984
Steve Miller Band,"I went to bed late last night 
Pulled down the shade 
And turned out the light 

I fell asleep, and I began to dream 
The most extraordinary beautiful dream 
Incense and perfume filled the air 
The sound of music was everywhere 

I met a woman by a babbling brook 
She was gifted, she was wise 
She was reading a book 
She talked about virtue 
She talked about vice 
She acted kinda naughty 
But she looked real nice 

I could see her body move 
To the rhythm, to the beat 
Of a powerful groove 
Her lips are red 
Her body is soft 
She is a movin' volcano 
Man, I mean she's hot 

She got the long cool legs 
She got the sexy sexy style 
She got the cool sweet walk 
She got the beautiful smile 

When I awoke, it was the break of day 
I got to go to work, I got to earn my pay 
I am a man who works on the line 
I'm the muscle, I'm the blood, I'm the overtime 
I gotta lift that bail 
Work my fingers to the bone 
You know I can't stop the train 
I gotta let it roll on 

No need to dream about it anymore 
'cause I found my dream lover on the 13th floor 
Incense and perfume filled the air 
The sound of music was everywhere 

I met a woman by a babbling brook 
She was gifted, she was wise 
She was reading a book 
Her lips are red 
Her body is soft 
She is a movin' volcano 
Man, I mean she's hot 

No need to dream about it anymore 
'cause I found my dream lover on the 13th floor 

She got the long cool legs 
She got the sexy sexy style 
She got the cool sweet walk 
She got the beautiful smile

That you get lost in her eyes 
She takes you away 
You start to talk 
And time it flies

She sings a song 
Of water turned to sand 
She waits, her time is her own 

Inside her looking glass 
Black is the color she sees 
While waiting for the sun 
She lives, so patiently 

Young man travelling along 
Passes by a window 
Singing a song 

Feel the wind blow 
As my blood flows 
Through the shadows 
Of my soul, today 

See the rainbows 
As my love grows 
My heart knows 
What my mind won't say 

The living is easy 
I'm born to be free 
The living is easy 
There's no reason to explain 

Sitting in her sitting room, patiently 
She waits for a change, suddenly 
Oh, the changes come 
Hearing a song, her blood begins to flow 
She no longer is alone 

Lying in her sitting room, silently 
He touches her hand, joyfully 
And so love has begun 
With joy in her heart 
She receives his flowing soul 
And love grows 
And it grows 
And it grows 

Inside her purple house 
Oh Lord, filled by her man 
A child begins to grow 
Oh Lord, who can understand

Worried about the voters but he won't be worried long

To the light 
To the light 

She is standing in the doorway 
With the love light in her eye 
And she beckons me to journey 
Through the night 
Through the night 

Listen to the blackbird sadly sing 
For you, for me 
Look at all the pointless suffering 
Humanity 

To the people, who are naked 
As they breathe in amber haze 
Wandering endlessly narcotic 
Through the maze 
Through the maze 

To the leaders, who are timeless 
As they flaunt their warlike ways 
Flying endlessly o'er the wasteland 
Seeking praise 
Seeking praise 

Listen to the blackbird sadly sing 
For you, for me 
Look at all the pointless suffering 
Humanity 


",Journey from Eden,1994
Steve Miller Band,"I met you on somebody's island
You thought you had known me before
I brought you a crate of papaya
Then waited all night by your door
You probably wouldn't remember
I probably couldn't forget
Jungle love, in the surf, in the pouring rain
Everything's better when wet

Jungle love, it's drivin' me mad
It's makin' me crazy
Jungle love, it's drivin' me mad
It's makin' me crazy

But lately you live in the jungle
I never see you alone
But we need some definite answers
So I thought I would write you a poem
The question to everyone's answer
Is usually asked from within
But the patterns of the rain and the truth they contain
Have written my life on your skin

Jungle love, it's drivin' me mad
It's makin' me crazy
Jungle love, it's drivin' me mad
It's makin' me crazy

You treat me like I was your ocean
You swim in my blood when it's warm
My cycles of circular motion
Protect you and keep you from harm
You live in a world of illusion
Where everything's peaches and cream
We all face a scarlet conclusion
But we spend our time in a dream

Jungle love, it's drivin' me mad
It's makin' me crazy
Jungle love, it's drivin' me mad
It's makin' me crazy

Jungle love, it's drivin' me mad
It's makin' me crazy
Jungle love, it's drivin' me mad
It's makin' me crazy",Jungle Love,1994

Kept it in a chrome elevator, yeah 

When the sun began to shine

Kow Kow played the chimes 
Together they would go for a ride 

As they travelled with a heavy load 
They came across a dead horse at the side of the road 
With two generals standing at each end 
Fighting over whose fault it had been 

And all that's left was this war 
And they couldn't get things back together like they were before

Turn it on, let it shine

I hear the magic in your sighs
Just when I think I'm gonna get away
I hear those words that you always say

For my transgressions
And that He paid that price
A long, long time ago

When He gave His life for me
On a hill called Calvary
But there's something else
I want to know

Does He still feel the nails
Every time I fail?
Does He hear the crowd cry
Crucify, again?

Am I causing Him pain?
Then I know I've got to change
I just can't bear the thought
Of hurting Him

It seems that I'm so good
At breaking promises
And I treat His precious grace
So carelessly

But each time He forgives
What if He relives
The agony He felt on that tree?

Does He still feel the nails
Every time I fail?
Does He hear the crowd cry
Crucify, again?

Am I causing Him pain?
Then I know I've got to change
I just can't bear the thought
Of hurting Him

Holy, holy, holy is the Lord

With my sin?

Swaying to a fascinating strain

Soothing and slow

When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band

Steve Morse,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

That field of corn would be deserted now
A man is born but he's no good no-how

I got my troubles and woe but sure as I know that Jordan will roll
I'll get along as long as a song is strong in my soul

Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around.
Traced her footsteps down to the shore,
'Fraid she's gone forever more.       
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my baby has gone from me.

There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.

Was alive as he could be,

And play just the same as you and me.

Right to the traffic cop.

I´m sure you knew

I faced the wall, and the wall
And did it my way.
Knocked out in bed last night
I´ve had my fill, my share of looting
And now, the tears subside
I find it all so amusing 
To think, I killed a cat
And may I say, oh no, not their way
But no, oh no, not me
I did it my way
For what is a brat,
What has he got
When he finds out that he cannot
Say the things he truly thinks
But only the words,
Not what he feels
The record shows,
I´ve got no clothes
And did it my way

That you had me replaced

Steve Nieve,"It's at times such as this she'd be tempted to spit
If she wasn't so ladylike
She imagines how she might have lived
Back when legends and history collide
So she looks to her prince finding he's so charmingly
Slumped at her side
Those days are recalled on the gallery wall
And she's waiting for passion or humor to strike

What shall we do, what shall we do with all this useless beauty?
All this useless beauty

Good Friday arrived, the sky darkened on time
Till he almost began to negotiate
She held his head like a baby and said ""it's okay if you cry""
Now he wants her to dress as if you couldn't guess
He desires to impress his associates
But he's part ugly beast and Hellenic deceased
So she finds that the mixture is hard to deny

[Chorus:]
She won't practice the looks from the great tragic books
That were later disgraced to face celluloid
It won't even make sense, but you can bet
If she isn't a sweetheart or plaything or pet
The film turns her into an unveiled threat

Nonsense prevails, modesty fails
Grace and virtue turn into stupidity
While the calendar fades almost all barricades to a pale compromise
And our leaders have feasts on the backsides of beasts
They still think they're the gods of antiquity
If something you missed didn't even exist
It was just an ideal, is it such a surprise?

You're Cinderella with a ball and chain
And the shoe seems to fit you
You tell the truth sometimes but
You wouldn't know it if it hit you

Wired up in your head?

Or was I just force fed?

And your benevolent face is beautiful to gaze upon
Now I just don't know who to tell to go to hell

With false and lovely modesty
I can recall the names I`ll miss
In the particle of me that cares for this

but every grace must have its price
I through some felicity may spin a tale of constant vice

Took the blossom of my youth and blew it all to smithereens

Now you could tell he wanted you `cause you almost taste it on his breath
But you always cheated life just like the bold dare-devil cheated death
Incidentally, late last night your understudy finally got what you deserve
In private she`s seductive but in public she`s prim, porcelain and nervous
Afraid someone will recognize the shame in her eyes

The subtle touch of authority will
Take you anytime down to the station
You say that it`s alright by me

Now that you`re shackled up to the rigmarole
With absolute control

I see you lying so wide awake
After I've given you all that you can take
So for heaven`s sake
Give me temptation

Still you want to succeed so badly
Finding your life will not be deadly
You tell me you can take it or leave it

Cellophane shrink-wrapped, so correct
Red dogs under illegal legs

Ooh, he's so cute, she is watching the detectives
When they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
They beat him up until the teardrops start
But he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart

Steve Nieve,"Why can't a man stand alone?
Must he be burdened by all that he's taught to consider his own?
His skin and his station, his kin and his crown, his flag and his nation
They just weigh him down

You know pride is a sin that we tend to forgive
But it gets hard to live
When you don't have the love in her heart to begin with
Why can't a man stand alone?

Why can't a woman be just what she seems?
Must she be tarnished by men who can only be men in their dreams?
When beauty meets ignorance they shout in the street 
Repeating their offer to each girl they meet

The respect that she needs, it isn't a gift
But it gets hard to lift yourself up
When you don't have the strength to begin with
Why can't a woman stand alone?

Why can't a baby sleep at night and dream of the time to come
And never fear the world outside the touch of someone very near

But I don`t know why you absolutely deny

You bowed down (you bowed down, you bowed down)
You bowed down (you bowed down, you bowed down)

When you first looked away I might say it was really a kindness
It must have hurt you to see how dreams sour
Now they say that justice and love are the next things to blindness
Well you`re getting plenty of both of them now
And so you parade where appointments are made
And never meant to be kept
Unless you accept

You bowed down (you bowed down, you bowed down)

You value the burnt amber of falling leaves
And you long to delay
As you feel their breath as they whisper
""It won`t hurt you now to betray
If you just bow down""

And now every time that we meet on the edge of hysteria
You`re helping them sell off some new party line
I remember a time when you would have seemed so superior
Now you say ""Will you please meet this good friend of mine?""
So you`re in demand as long as you kiss their hand
But all the applause is for their name not yours

But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you

Against your soul

And you're gonna regret

And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold

And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

And let me show you how it's done""

But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And, in the morning, kick me in the head

You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone

Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band

Without a song the road would never bend
When things go wrong, a man ain't got a friend
Without a song

That field of corn would never see a plow
That field of corn would be deserted now
A man is born but he's no good no-how
Without a song

I got my troubles and woe but sure as I know that Jordan will roll
I'll get along as long as a song is strong in my soul

I'll never know what makes the grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all

Running from the sun
Orphan stars and city lights
Fading one by one

Until they look like gold
Cold city sidewalks can turn your heart to stone

Cause I've got the will I'll survive

Has a song to sing

Is keeping yourself from the blues

Somewhere so very new
Caught in the magic of love
And your forgiveness
Selfish and too blind to see

You feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup, everything but you
I break the yolks and make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
I wipe the spots off of the mirror, don't leave the keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause

Dreams last for so long
Even after you're gone
And I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you

I call my mom, but she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee, but it didn't want to talk so I
Picked up the paper it was more bad news
More hearts being broken, more people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
I saw a movie it just wasn't the same 'cause
It was happy, I was sad, yeah
It only made me miss you, oh, so bad 'cause

Dreams last for so long
Even after you're gone
And I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you

I go about my business and I'm doing fine
Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line?
Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken every day

I brush my teeth, I put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up and turn the sheets down, yeah
And take a good, long look around
Put on my pj's and hopped into bed
I'm half alive, but I feel mostly dead, I
I try and tell myself it'll be alright
I shouldn't think anymore tonight 'cause

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Raised him on the banks of a river bed
On a houseboat tied to a big tall tree
A home for my papa and my mama and me

The clock strikes three and papa jumps to his feet
Already mama's cooking papa something to eat
At half past, papa he's ready to go
He jumps in his pirogue headed down the bayou

He's got fishing lines strung across the Louisiana Rivers
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
He's setting traps in the swamp catching anything he can
He's gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man

My Muskrat hides hanging by the dozens
Even got a lady mink, a muskrat's cousin
Got 'em out drying in the hot, hot sun
Tomorrow papa's gonna turn 'em into money

Well, they call mama Rita and my daddy Jack
Little baby brother on the floor that's Mack
Bren and Lin are the family twins
And big brother Ed's on the bayou fishing

On the river floats papa's great big boat
And that's how my papa goes into town
Takes him every bit of a night and a day
To even reach a place where the people stay

And I can hardly wait until tomorrow comes around
That's the day my papa takes his furs to town
Papa promised me that I could go
He'd even let me see a cowboy show

I saw the cowboys and Indians for the first time then
I told my pop I've gotta go again
Well, Papa said, ""Son we've got lines to run
We'll come back again but first there's work to be done""

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Burning bright 
Love is glowing in your eyes 
A flame to light our way 
That burns brighter everyday

Nobody loves me like you do 

Like a leaf

I could find no place to land 
I dream the hours away 
And wonder everyday 
Do dreams come true?
Nobody loves me like you do 

What if I never met you?
Where would I be right now?
Funny how life just falls in place somehow 
Ooh, you touched my heart in places 
That I never even knew 
'Cause nobody loves me like you do 

I was words without a tune 
I was a song still unsung 
A poem with no rhyme 
A dancer out of time

Waiting here beside the phone

Really ain't been getting along

I wish that I could fly away
And party 'til the break of day
And there I'll be sure to meet
The guy that would be special to me

Then mama comes and asks me
Why am I dreaming sitting alone?
Why not go out and have some fun
It's the only way I'll ever find

Steve Rushton,"It started on Thursday
At seven or maybe eight
You crashed into my world with a boom
You came over as a guest
I said I liked you and I confessed
By ten o' clock I was making fun of you
You stayed for a while
Then left with a smile
But at least I made you happy
You make me happy too
It's kinda cheesy to say but

You're everything I want
When I'm with you all the hurting stops
You're the hand that fits my glove
And I'll never replace you
'Cause I'll never find love so true

It's only been three days
You're playing the waiting game
Been acting cool when we're not together
I drove you home from school
When I'm with you I feel so cool
I wish this feeling would last forever
And I stare into space
My heart starts to race
But at least I've got your picture
You gave me yesterday
It's kinda cheesy to say but

You're everything I want
When I'm with you all the hurting stops
You're the hand that fits my glove
And I'll never replace you
'Cause I'll never find love so true

Two years and we're going strong
They say that time flies when you're having fun
I never wanna be alone again

And love is suffocating me, but I'd kind of like to be

All I've known is empty promises and pain

Believe you can go where you've never been
And you can fly high with the strength of all your friends

If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible

In place a new sun is rising
Old condemnation is vaporating to the sky (to the sky)

",I'm Still In Love With You,
Steve Ryan,"V1) Imagining Love, I try to imagine the true definition of love

It seems so simple, Yet the definition is so long

What does love really mean to you

Is it the physical attraction to another or is it 

The mental attraction to you, just tell me please, just tell me

You see love is full of hate, just as the good is full of wrong

While some actions seem so just,  Others are obviously just full of lust

Chorus:

You see love is full of envy, just like the jealous brother of the night

I can’t understand why this thing called love, make people lose sight of their life


V2) As the definition continues to begin, I realize that love’s definition never ends

For when you think you have found the solution,you find that the solution is full of loops

Unexplainable is the magic power of love, causing people to change

What they formerly knew was true because they thought someone else loved them too

Chorus:

V3) You see love is full of sorrow while happiness is here today

The sadness, the sadness will come tomorrow and more pain will thereafter follow

But one thing that is seen to remain 

Is that while things seem to change, 

they truly are still the same, they truly are the same

Chorus:

V4)For we really don’t know the true definition of love

It’s so amazing, amazing, amazing 

Is how it can’t be seen

But in my heart I believe that if we continue to live and learn

We will eventually know what true love means

And this is called imagining love, love, love
",Imagining Love,

Steve Ryan,"Never should you feel like you’re going through
A night in life
That brings on solitude
Cause someone cares for you, for you

You opened the door
And you walked in all alone
You placed your keys on the floor
You felt the silence in your home
What’s on your mind
Does loneliness have a throne
Don’t’ keep your feelings inside
When it comes to love why do you hide

Chorus:
Never should you feel like you’re going through
A night in life
That brings on solitude

Just trust me and take me in

One day I realize, what you mean to me
Though love is there inside, it don’t seem to be
When I get close to you, you take a step back or two
And when I refuse, You say to me you don’t wanna lose

Chorus
This in between game
Is so over played
My heart just can’t take 
Another dissappointing ache
If we’re going to be, then let us be
But if we’re not, then set us free
This in between game, this in between game

V2
I looked into your eyes
Trying to see what you see
I felt so blind
Cause your heart don’t match the scene
You tried to make me feel like a fool
Chasing after you
But you don’t make a move
Unless you think I’m leaving you

Chorus

V3
I looked into your eyes
They made me realize
That time’s not on our side
You let our love pass us by
I believed in you and me
I thought our love could be
But it was just a dream
It was just a fantasy

Chorus
",This In-Between Game,

You really hurt me last night
You made me cry, inside
Can’t believe what I’m seeing
Someone else kissing you
It’s like my mind is deceiving
Leaving me confused

Chorus
It is reality now that I see
There’s no us, there’s only you and then there’s me
I thought we loved one another
That fantasy ain’t true
Your lies are undercover
And now you revealed the truth
You revealed the truth

I won’t put all the blame on you
I ignored, this ain’t new
I saw the signs around me
I made reasons not to see
My heart wouldn’t leave
Now it’s torn apart from me

What a moment, when we can see the day
When we can look at our neighbors and say
That we do believe, that we share the same dream
Of a future, with peace and prosperity
Where we all live equally
Where we’re all in harmony
Should live with love cause we’re human beings

Have respect with your community
We are all each other’s family

Have pride with humility

We can’t go on, with all of this hate
Let’s not be divided, let us communicate
Although we may not agree, we can learn to disagree
And accept each other without forcing our beliefs

And have pride with humility
Let go your ego so the world can be free

My understanding is expanding over time
Inside a new light is shining

And Condemnation’s evaporating to the sky (to the sky)

That bloom in the spring

Because you are, a dream to me
I want to show you love, through eternity
Because you are, the sun in my sky
I want to show you, love through all time
And I'll give up everything, this very moment
To stare in your eyes, your eyes

You were my fantasy
You’re now my reality
Your gaze is so amazing
I hear just what it’s saying
You’re the river that flows through me
It makes my heart beat

It lies within you
The touch of true affection
Comes from every thing you do

Like my first time on the night we met
I wish I could go back there tonight, tonight
Looking in your eyes the way you held me tight
Where'd it all the wrong, when it felt so right
There's nowhere I'd rather be tonight, tonight
Tonight
Funny how you said people never change
Always be together 'til the very end
But that was then and this is now
Funny how I held onto your every word
Trusted and believed, no matter what I heard

You and me were like a movie scene
Superstars playing in a teenage dream
There's no rewinding life tonight, tonight
Guess you could've broken someone else's heart
I'm the lucky winner because I played the part
Don't want to say goodbye tonight, tonight

There'll never ever be another one

You said ""I'll be your first, my love""
There'll never ever be another one 
Don't worry I'll tell no one
You and me together'll be so much fun
Sometimes you gotta let things be
Even when the truth is that you lied to me
I want to keep these thoughts away, from me
From me
It's the little things that I dream about
That no one ever talks about
The little things I think about
That no one ever dreams about
The kisses that were promises
That were suppose to be planned

Steve Stevens,"A million old soldiers will fade away
But a dream goes on forever
I'm left standing here, I've got nothing to say
All is silent within my dream

A thousand true loves will live and die
But a dream lives on forever
The days and the years will go streaking by
But the time has stopped in my dream

We all have our everyday hopes and fears
And you'll find no exception in me
But that doesn't get me through a sea of tears
Over life's biggest tragedy

You're so long ago and so far away
But my dream lives on forever
I guess I believe that I'll see you one day
For without it there is no dream

You're so far away and so long ago
But my dream goes on forever
And how much I loved you you'll never know

Steve Stoeckel,"You might wake up some mornin'
To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise
You'll catch a fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

You might have heard my footsteps
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me runnin'
Through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathin'

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

Steve Stone,"Let ye cast no judgement upon thy neighbor
Before the beam of thy own eyes have been cleansed
In the wicked ways of the world
God gives the remission for all of our sins

When I was a young one the preacher put oil on my sixth chakra (sixth chakra)
He knew when I was older I'd wanna follow 2Pac and Big Papa (Big Papa)
They thought I was so devilish in the dark I would listen to sick opera
But this choppa' will be reppin' the city where RDV's Young Rich and Slick's got ya
Well in peace
I don't know why they wanna call me up every Easter Sunday to the altar
Maybe the music I am doin' is never gospel, sinner is what they call ya
I know we look a little strange and we the gang my lane is what I offer
3 dimensional altar with a ego on top of the rock of Gibraltar

I see-e, it's not the way the Bible people want me to be-e
Flippin' the fire for the family focused and free-e
Listen to me-e doing it for T.V-e
With the rebel yell, came out of my shell
Preacher said tell your people let go of your coat-tail
With a tremendous fail he never to say my livin' is hell
But even worse said I lead my people to Hell's Bells
Lookin' at me just like my mother and father would breed creatures
Not an evil bone in my body and never known to be naughty in my seeds either
Simple and plain like a cheese pizza
I don't know prayin' on my knees keep us from heat seekers
Lovin' the bleed feature while the people tell me that I need Jesus!

Talk about, judgement
Speakin' to me with the people I'm leadin' em underway
And you read me and see me easy to be shunned away
But you got it all wrong
You seem to tell me I need Jesus! (oh, Jesus! Jesus!)
Every day they wanna condemn me
None of 'em even know me
Anyone ever that sinned cast the stone out
I'm stoned, let's talk about it

I'm askin'
What's happening?
Boy, 'cause they bashing me
Bangin' the Bible, butcher boy don't bother with blasphemy
Call em a crazy critic comin' causin' catastrophes
Aimin' at Aaron a lot of ammo and an angel actually
Ah mane, Amen
You people let the steeples speak in evil and the neezle playing God hymn
My mother was a Christian but I used to go with the wicked for the stick and whats the problem
Questioning the K.O.D.'s grim, anybody talkin hella crazy I'm 'bout to jaw them
You'll be up on a cross whenever you step to me so take precautions
Y'all false actors, callin' me a demon when I talk backwards siht pot
Tecca Nina gonna be sought after this drop by the people that go toss rappers hip hop
So you thinking you religious?
When you condemn another man you never lead us
Telling me whats under me is gonna heat us
Never believe ya cause really you need Jesus
Leave us

Talk about, judgement
Speakin' to me with the people I'm leadin' em underway
And you read me see me easy to be shunned away
But you got it all wrong
Let's talk about it

Mama never really talked about God
All that I was ever taught was I'm odd
Heard he knew 'bout every thought that I hide
Dirty mind I'd see a cross and I'd hide
Lost without God, salty 'bout that
But I was captivated by the bosses outside
I plotted every way to getting draws by my squad
Ask round why every man goes bad
Happens to pass down like second hand clothes man
Salvage a blouse gown and manicured toes had
Half of us ground bound for hell and Lord knows
Need a savior they say slain for your behavior
Raised in three days grace be what he gave ya
The sun that'll make ya want to gravitate ta
Pain temperate son, 'cause sins you didn't pay for
Bow to a name insane fast they told her
Vows to a dame, the tame Casanova
Wild, didn't change and came crash imposer
Doused in the flames and bank chapter closure
Spiritually drained, crashed and vulgar
Needed somewhere to go until rain passes over
Seeking a miracle from a stained-glass Jehovah
But I don't know if the ordained pastor's sober
Dang in disdain, prayed in vain
Care to sling dough, explain, do anything
Lay hands, borough plain, you entertained
Dealt pain, process ain't growing the brains
Confusing, now my fangs out, protruding
Rebuking, from mouth full of Communion
Scorned by lukewarm kind it's time you've been
Warned the storm formed now find refusing",Need Jesus,2016

It's time to divide everything up

Where so many nights we made love
We've gone through everything
And given back the rings
We once cherished
You can take the things you want
And leave the things you don't
But as for me

I'll take the memories

After all we've been through
But I'll take the memories
If I can't have you

I don't know just what I'll do
I've been so used to loving you
Such a long time
Even though I'll try
There's no way that I'll get you off my mind
So while we're packing up our lives
And saying our goodbyes, I want to tell you

Steve Susskind,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me

Really do come true.

Steve Swallow,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

The moon may be high

Gathering possessions snacking on refreshments
While the world speaks drinks like they need a pregnant
That's why we need Jesus for biblical reflection

her mama taught her everything she'd need to get along
and her Sunday School teacher taught her right and wrong
raised to be respectable but born to be poor
it was all she'd ever known but she figured there was more
when she came of age Jenny made herself a vow
""I'm gonna get out and I don't care how""

It appeared every Autumn on the courthouse lawn
and the leaves never fell till the carnival was gone
Michael was a barker for an arcade ride
with a smooth-talk tongue and a wandering eye
""get your tickets here for the Halls O'Mirrors maze
if you can't get out I know I couple ways""
he caught Jenny's eye but her thoughts looked down
all she wanted was a ticket going out of that town

chorus:
Oh how I want to bury you
bury you and run away--done away
how I want to bury your memory
why don't you let me be?

Michael stole a kiss then he whispered at last
""you're a little old-fashioned so forget about your past
these Bible belt folks think living is a sin
so they all start dying from the day they're born again""
and there atop the Ferris wheel the colours were a blur
the morning said he loved her but she wasn't really sure
he made her promise not to leave until he came to get her
she promised him but she should have known better

(chorus)

On a train--stowaway
Jesus loves you still and your mama wants you home
but oh bridges burn
when you carry your shame and you think you can't return

(chorus)

When they finally found her body on a cold dog day
it was in a cattle car buried in the hay
a note in the pocket of her calico dress
said ""I'm guilty as sin but I can't confess""
once you know the truth you can hide it on a shelf
but unless you bring it down you can't live with yourself
in her right hand Jenny held the Bible of her mother
Jenny had a pistol in the other

On a Saturday night all the girls run free
singing ""bury me not on the lone prairie""

In a ninety-floor Manhattan address
lives a watchdog called the National Press
and around his collar's written the line
""The Protector Of Our Hearts And Minds""

but read between the lines and see
this dog's been barking up the wrong tree

In remembrance of no one at all

Steve Thornton,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2001

All it shining to the brim with gold
All in a dream when reelin' down the road

And I swear the mad March Hare and the Mad Hatter, he was there
And someone shouted, life is so absurd

Set the ravens free and pulled the tower down
And the tens are turned to beer and upon a gondolier

I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it

From major to minor everytime we say goodbye

Haunts my reverie

And we call it bella notte

Has one more drink of the cold liquid courage
To keep on the level he needs
Soothed by the sound of the wheels on the ground
But he won't hear the tires when they scream

Deny your dark side, I know
All about your secret life 
Oh Eve

And so the moon is high 
I see that love is blind
To the fire in your eyes

As our garden fiercely burns
We have no place to hide
Naked and cold running from the wind
Now wrapped in skin

It's voodoo that you possess
(Your heaven is danger)
Deny your dark side, I know
All about your secret life

It's voodoo that you possess
(Your heaven is danger)
Behind those lucid eyes
The shadow of the serpent lies
Oh Eve 
All about Eve

And though the sun goes down 
The mortals never know",All About Eve,1996
Steve Vai,"Bangkok, Oriental setting
And the city don't know that the city is getting
The creme de la creme of the chess world in a
Show with everything but Yul Brynner

Time flies doesn't seem a minute
Since the Tirolean spa had the chess boys in it
All change don't you know that when you
Play at this level there's no ordinary venue

It's Iceland or the Philippines or Hastings or
or this place!

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the god's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me

One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces, brother

It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board, not looking at the city

Whaddya mean? Ya seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town

Tea, girls, warm, sweet
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite

Get Thai'd! You're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine

One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me

Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a
Muddy old river or reclining Buddha

And thank God I'm only watching the game controlling it

I don't see you guys rating
The kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you

So you better go back to your bars, your temples, your massage
parlours

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history
I can feel an angel sliding up to me

One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me",Bangkok,1996

Steve Vai,"Everybody's a dreamer
And everybody's a star
And everybody's in movies
It doesn't matter who you are

There are stars in every city
In every house and on every street
And if you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Their names are written in concrete

Don't step on Greta Garbo
As you walk down the Boulevard
She looks so weak and fragile
That's why she tried to be so hard

But they turned her into a princess
And they sat her on a throne
But she turned her back on stardom
Because she wanted to be alone

You can see all the stars as you
Walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognize
Some that you hardly even heard of

People who worked and suffered
And struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some
Who suffered in vain

Rudolph Valentino looks
Very much alive
And he's lookin' up ladies' dresses
As they sadly pass him by

Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi
'Cause he's liable to turn and bite
But stand close by Bette Davis
Because hers was such a lonely life

And if you covered him with garbage
George Ganders would still have style
And if you stamped on Micky Roonie
He would still turn around and smile

But please don't tread on our dearest Marilyn
'Cause she's not very tough
She should have been made of finer steel
But she was only made of flesh and blood

And you can see all the stars
As you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognize
Some that you hardly ever heard of

People who worked and suffered
And struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some
Who suffered in vain

Everybody's a dreamer
And everybody's a star
And everybody's in movies
It doesn't matter who you are

And those who are successful
Be always on your guard
Success walks hand in hand
With failure along Hollywood Boulevard

I wish my life was a non-stop Hollywood movie show
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain
And celluloid heroes never really die

And you can see all the stars
As you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognize
Some that you hardly ever heard of

People who worked and suffered
And struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some
Who suffered in vain

La la la la [unverified]
Celluloid heroes never feel any pain
And celluloid heroes never really die

I wish my life was a non-stop Hollywood movie show
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes
'Cause celluloid heroes never feel any pain
And celluloid heroes never really die

Steve Vai,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water,2005
Steve Vai,"Te llevo donde hay música,
Que entre nosotros está
El mundo por una vez harás
Que gire a tu voluntad
Alguien ha dicho,
""La música es la linea 
De buena esperanza""
Entonces buena esperanza

Si hay un silencio para romper
Y un muro de hostilidad,
Te llevo donde hay música
Que algo sucederá
Toma esta libertad
Que te lleva a donde va
Y mira, donde hay música
Hay prados todavía

Y mira, y siente este escalofrío en ti
Después encontrarás,
En el alma encontrarás
Donde hay música, ahí estaré yo
Han derribado el Odeón
Construirán un discount
Un sueño más que convertirán
En otra vulgaridad
Alguien ha dicho, 
""Señal de que cambia el tiempo""

Alguien que se resiste
A cambiar por dentro
Toma esta libertad
Que te lleva a donde va
Y mira, donde hay música
Aún hay fantasía y, mira,
Con nuestros pies sobre las nubes
Después encontrarás te llevo",Donde Hay Musica,2007
Steve Vai,"(Hello, mirror, so glad to see you, my friend, it's been a while)

Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage run through my head
Patterns of my live have thawed and torn me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament
Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me
A bitter fear at the thought of my amends
Hoping that the step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this un-swept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development
We will be amazed before we are halfway through.
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.
We will comprehend the word serenity, and we will know peace
No matter how far down the scale we have gone.
We will see how our experience can benefit others.
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.
We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.
Self-seeking will slip away.
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.
Fear of people and economic insecurity will leave us.
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.
Are these extravagant promises? We think not.
They have been fulfilled amongst others
Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.
We will always be true to our principles.

You're only as sick as your secrets
But the truth shall set you free.
The truth is the truth.
That's all you can do is live with it.",Repentance,2007
