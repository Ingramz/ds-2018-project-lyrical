Kosheen,"Catch you 

You create misery 
Have your cake and eat it 
Take your place in history 
And pray we don't repeat it 

Call it faith, 
call it back, 
call it off 
Don't call me later 
Lay your head in your bed
It's just how they made it 

Out of my way I'm running 
I'm gonna catch you if I can 
Out of my way I'm coming 
I'm gonna catch you if I can 

Out of my way I'm running 
I'm gonna catch you if I can 
Out of my way start running 
I'm gonna catch you

It's your day believe it 
It's your date with destiny 
It's too late to leave it 
After all it's your
it's your party 
Call it luck, call it faith, 
call me beautiful to my face 
Call it out to my surprise 
It's just how they made it 

Out of my way I'm running 
I'm gonna catch you if I can 
Out of my way I'm coming

Kosheen,"The road is closing in
And you can cross the floor
The music drives you
Sends you climbing walls
The tears of recollection
Are left across your face
There are some lies you put there
And some you arrange

Just don't want to come over
Can't seem to love one another
You want to run and take cover
Your silence hides you from the inside

Just don't want to come over
Can't seem to love one another
You want to run and take cover
Your silence hides you from the inside

You'd better get awake now
It's time to stand up tall
I can touch you so far behind walls
And see the sun is rising
In an almost perfect sky
See how far we travel and how hard we try

Just don't want to come over
Can't seem to love one another
You want to run and take cover
Your silence hides you from the inside

Just don't want to come over
Can't seem to love one another
You want to run and take cover
Your silence hides you from the inside

Just don't want to come over
Can't seem to love one another

Kosheen,"Sweet untouchable you
You gave me the runaround
All you say and what you do
Picks me up and leaves me hanging

Do you call, do you
Do you call, do you
Do you call, do you call that lovin' me?
I don't, I don't, I don't no no

Sweet unthinkable past
How you jog my memory
I knew, I knew it wouldn't last
Cause you keep on pickin' me up and leaving me hanging

Sweet unstoppable you
Send my system crashing
All you say is not what you do
You just keep on pickin' me up and leaving me
Keep on pickin' me up and leaving me

Paralizin', pull me over.
I'm so dumb, and your so clever.
Scrutinize, my best endeavor.
Come the day, when I will leave, at my pride.

Empty skies but a butterflies wings beat silent like air
Call us free by a promise torn, you said ill meet you there

Cross the oceans

Kosheen,"We move in numbers
Like shifting sand
But we're too eager
To understand
'Cause we're not ready
We're too proud

Now we're finding a different way
We've been chasin' each others tails
Now we're ridin' a new wave
All on our own way
More than a face in the crowd (a face in a crowd)

Hundreds of people
All runnin' 'round
But there's no color
And there's no sound
We move in silence
Looking down

Now we're finding a different way

Kosheen,"I should have treated you a bit warmer
Kept you over here in my corner
After all is said and done
You still got me on the run
A bit longer
Every day and night
I wish I had tried
A bit harder 
I should try a little bit harder
I should try a little bit harder

Looking back
I could have been smarter
Maybe given time
We could get it together
I've got memories of our time
Playing over in my mind
I cannot forget
I wish I could make it right
Maybe if I could turn back time
We could have made it if I tried
If I tried

I should try a little bit harder
I should try a little bit harder

I couldn't meet with your demands
So much I couldn't understand
All the good things that we had
Slip like water through my hands
Was I blind that I didn't see
That you needed more from me
How much we had to try
We could make it if I try

I should try a little bit harder
I should try a little bit harder
I should try a little bit harder
I should try a little bit harder",Harder,2001

Kosheen,"You're like a child with old eyes,
Cynical and sensible, always full of surprises
You travel far and wide
Looking for the feeling, lost inside you
They don't understand you, no
Until it's too late
With everything they've handed you
On a silver plate

Are you hungry for a little more
Than what you've had before?
Are you hungry for a taste of life?
Whet your appetite, are you hungry?

Now give me this mountainside
Cool waters to lie beside
Give me these two strong eyes
To see the difference between truth and lies
Ah, give me this feeling when you kiss me baby

Every day and every night
That's all I need, yes
Everything is gonna be all right

Are you hungry for a little more
Than what you've had before?
Are you hungry for a taste of life?
Whet your appetite, are you hungry?

You're like a sight for sore eyes, lyrical and gentle
Border-lining sentimental
You're like a dream realized
So why do I keep falling back to sleep,
I'm so serious and deep.

Are you hungry for a little more
Than what you've had before?

Your problems are little, so sing hey diddle diddle

Sittin' there day in day out
Made her wanna scream and shout out loud

And then one sunny day
He came and took her breath away
Hey hey

Lean as a tree 
His shadow stretched across the street
He wore a charmer's smile
He always went that extra mile - 
Extra mile

He was an old-fashioned guy
These modern times came as a big surprise
They were gonna tear him down
They were gonna knock him around

that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know

So get back to the basics and face it.

Can't you taste it? 
See they baste it in an imitation butter. 
We've ate it and realized its not nature to mother
Generic like no other, man, fuck big brotha! 

The Kottonmouth King klick. Are you blind or somethin'? 
Are you blind to the facts? You think that this system,

By the way I got the freaks on point
Call up the krew, hook it up. Lata."" 
I hung up with X and gave my boys a holla. 
D-loc picked up said ""What's up balla?""

There'll be a lotta beer and some naughty hotties

I reach into the back and pull out the 64,

Yo, that drink got me on tilt, 
Ya better sit down 'cause you about to spill
Now we approach up on the corner of the house party 
I'm down, I'm told?
Conversation with the krew, I thought you knew to pass the brew 
Tasted kinda freaked, Saint your ass is through 
Break out the beer bong man, I want to get faded
'cause drinkin' out the bottle is just so overrated, 
We got the 22, we're fillin' up on Mickeys

Kottonmouth Kings,"(Intro):
Creep, creep, I'm on the creep
The creep for the kind bud
O.C. late night, rolling in the v-dub
Sick of scraping resin so I'm looking for a sack
All I learn, I'll head for burn
BSO's got my back
Right on, right on brother, blaze on
You better rip that shit, rip it
It's that 1605 shit, real hunnington beats
Backyard fucking, garage style

(Chorus):
Bump, bump, bump
That's the sound of the fifteens while they're hitting in my trunk
Said bump, bump, bump
We're the Kottonmouth Kings and we don't give a fuck

(Verse) Saint Dog:
Well I'm that kid that the bitches talk about
Saint's what they shout, you got all the clout
A day in the life of a Kottonmouth King, 1605 (fool pass me the thing)
Now the stereo is off, I sway, push play
You hear humble gods from a mile away
All the heads are bobbing because the base is bumping
D-Loc is mumbling, (I got a little something)
Well he passed me a hornet and I took a sip
Sparked up a bowl and I took a rip, trip
Came to halt at an intersection
Turned up the music at my discretion
D-Loc in the back said what do I see
A jeep full of freaks just staring at me
D-Loc was right, they were in a range rover
Looked over my shoulder, I pulled them all over
They got out the car and stepped to my side
I said, hello ladies let's take a ride
I'm Saint Dog, that's D-Loc the man
Daddy X is the one that's driving the van
So climb on in and don't be shy
We're gonna close the doors and let the games be fly
Once again I said it, my name's ST
It's just another day of a P-T-be	
Come on, come on

(Chorus)x2

Saint Dog putting it down for suburban pride

(Verse) Saint Dog:
I was living my life on a nine to five
Up early in the morning trying to survive
Chump change, it's a shame, with no education
No inspiration, no destination,
But now my occupation is to do what I like
Keep the crowd moving and rock the mic
Because if I don't rock it, then another sucker will
And if you don't jock it, then I can't pay the bills
Trick Daddy X threw me out on stage
Said Saint, represent for the underage
Same damn year, my face is up and raised
Got that ring in my nose labeled sixteen gauge

D-Loc:
No Saint dog, I hunt ducks with a twelve gauge
And when I'm on the stage, yes I get get real blazed
Get me on the court my skills will put you in a maze
T-T-T-twicking a twine all day
Come on, come on

(Chorus)x3

D-Loc's on the mic, rip rip shit up

(Verse) D-Loc:
It's the unpolitical, psychoanalytical,
Undefeated Champ that will stick you fool
My style is crazy, not wooka wakka lazy
If you chill with me I'll be sure to (blaze thee)
Plant you in the ground, let you drift like a daisy
That shit's in my system makes my life kind of hazy
My momma, my poppa, I think I should tell them
The J gots my head, and fucked up my cerebellum
It's about time to compute your math
Because my beats keep bumping like a seismograph
See I've tripped before, but never like this
Straight to my mind, put my brain in a bliss
I won't fake the funk, when I'm smoking on a skunk
That forty bowl evil got my peacock drunk
And like Micky Mantle, I can switch my stance
I'm a supercharged baller that's electrically enhanced
My flows are silky soft, like I'm writing them in lotion
And I'm a lyricist, that's poetry in motion
To each town, to each house, I cause mass commmotion
?????? take it all for my potion
Farewell to all and to all goodnight
I'm leaving these ??? out all night
Wait wait wait you said ??? that shit will suck you up
Get off the ??? and rock the bump
Come on

And it's my time to rock the stage, misunderstood

One in a million, a million in one
A stoner reeking havoc, but I don't carry a gun
Only a microphones so I can rock the stage
Don't got a beeper But I got some pages of some dope ass lyrics

Smoked out the officer on my probation
Bustin caps in the balls of this generation
I flip this phat verse with no hesitation

Never gun grippin', always 40 sippin'
Anarchy is the life of me, give me booze, blunts, broads
And I'll tap all three

Didi dodi didi dodi didi dodi day
Make some room so these players can play
So we can play on, play on

Now I woke up this morning and I thought about Hoss
Smoked a cigarette and I chucked my dirty drawers
Threw on some Dickies and I grabbed my back chain
Slapped it down my waist and I let my pants hang
Beanie on my head just to cover up my lump
The night before got in a fight just cause I was drunk
Grabbed my sack of weed and I loaded up the bong
Took a rip held it in then I coughed up a lung
Burn some incense so I can cover up the smell
An everyday thing that I live to tell
Pulled out my Black Flys, covered up my red eyes
If that copper pulls me over well its lies, lies, lies
Dirty copper, dirty copper, dirty copper

Now the stereo is on and the CD was bumpin'
Insane Clown Posse talkin' bout chicken huntin'
Walked up to the fridge, opened it up and grabbed my brew
Picked up the phone dialed my pimp and called the crew
Party later on, over by river jetties
56th Street so you know there'll be some betties
Pacific Coast Highway takes me to my destination
Party time baby, its a nightly occupation
Stepped out the pad, walked in the player's den
On the way mail a letter to my brother in the pen
There's a smile on your face from my smooth dub style
See you later alligator, after a while crocodile

Now a new day dawned, lets get things started
Hit the bong, wrote a song, took a piss and farted
Dip my blue jeans in some bleach and starches
Mobbin' OC we need the golden arches
D-Loc where you at?
Saint's hung over and he started to yack
Kicked out of Mickey D's 'cause we don't know how to act
Lets call up Kevin Zinger hook a forty sack
Now tonight's the night like DJ Quik
At least 3 parties that we gotta hit
And if the cops show up were gonna start some shit
Riot time baby-Kottonmouth Klick
Punk rock music homegrown in OC
Adolescents, Doggy Style, DI and Social D
No Doubt, Agent Orange now the PTB
The last generation of the dynasty
Now the skates in the sack lets hit the ditch
Broke up with my girlie cause the ho was a bitch
Still that boy that be puttin' it down
Representin' OC, P-Town

This the type of thing that we be doin' everyday
Didi dodi didi dodi didi dodi day
Make some room so these players can play
So we can play on play on

Brought the 77 slant nose V-dub Bug
Leaks oil but the roads (?)called it crazy (mug?)
Its a little noisy but inside its all good
Got two 15's underneath the hood
Well I was rollin' down Yorba Linda Blvd.
Got the neighborhoods bumpin', tainted hard
Dodgin' and weavin' down suburban streets
Till this one house wife started bitchin' at me
So I pulled the bug over and I revved it up
First gear lit em up, then I backed it up
Over the curb, told her to kiss my ass
Gave her the bird, boned out on that ass
Back on the mission to score a sack
77 boned out passed the Cadillac
Heard a horn honk it was full of freaks
Ladies on my tip cause I'm so unique
Turn the bass high and I tilted my lid
I'm used to gettin' jocked, I'm that P-Town kid
And you know I'm doin' shit that you wish you did
Dip right goin' 30 around the corner I slid
Stopped at the school jumped on my skate
4 freaks showed up, one I use to date
They broke out the blunt and they got me stoned
Another day gone, so long, so long

Make some room so these players can play

I'ma get you so high

Back up off me, I need room to puff
Fuck Babylon, man I can't get enough
I smoke, so I like it going down
We're all getting lifted 'cause I just stole a pound
Two hits and pass, that's what Saint's yellin
Fuck that shit, I'm hittin till my mind's jelly
And when I'm done, I'll head to Flannagan's
To play some pool and that's with a couple friends

Grab a sack, it's off to a local park
Break out the bong, pack it tight and let it spark
Windows up so the bug's gettin fishbowled
And if you're in you can't escape the indo
Oh shit, it's gettin deep into my mind
I took 7 hits off that bud called kind
Close my eyes, my mind starts joggin
Here I go again, man, my mind's boggling

I'ma get you so high, mind boggling
I'ma make that ass fly, mind boggling
Hit the bong stand by, mind boggling
I'ma get you so high

Here I go reminiscing about the weekend
Takin time to remember where my shit has been
Dinner to dancing, fly girl romancing
Ballin with the homies, smoking buds and relaxin
(?) that shit is how I was smoking
Fuck this schwag weed, indo is what I'm tokin
Splif to my lips as I tilt my head back
Lookin like a mack 'cause I'm down to blaze a sack
I said inhale, exhale, kottonmouth hits so I said 'that's swell'
Pass a tweak to the left, party busters set in
I need some fresh air 'cause I'm high off that in
Walked towards the door but man I didn't get far
High kicked in, I took a seat at the bar
As I look into the sky and the air starts fogging
Here I go again, yo my mind's boggling

I'ma get you so high, mind boggling
I'ma make that ass fly, mind boggling
Hit the bong stand by, mind boggling

Here I go getting deeper into my mind again
Thinking bout good times, smoking kind again
By myself so you say, am I a stoner or a loner
Man I can't cope with this lil hell that I'm livin in
I got family members fiending from the cocaine
And loved ones locked up in prison
That's why I'm bailin' ya'll, man fuck the system!
all the pressures of this life get me frustrated
So I reach for the bong so I can get faded
I blaze a bowl and it take me to another level
To escape the pain and all my life's trouble
Close my eyes, pray take the pain away
Ask the lord should I live to see another day

Just don't take it for granted 
Life, to live while you live 

Death, to give what you get 
Pain, the reality of change 
I wonder whether, things will ever get better 
Everyday, there's more pain that comes my way 
And so I pray, the lord to take me away 
And if I lay, in the casket 6 feet deep 
I ask to be at ease and please don't mourn me 

I picture life as a dream here today gone tomorrow 
Love equals hollow, hate equals sorrow 
Now follow the real as I take you 
To a field in my mind where I journey 
Sucker bitches can't burn me, bring an attorney 
'Cause since child birth 
I've been raised to do dirt on this earth, yes it hurts 
To find out that i can't get away from all the pressures and pain 
And misfortunes that I've gained straight 

Sometimes a fire grows inside, hatred starts to rise
Still i can't despise all the lies I've been told
The secrets they hold 
The government control, man fuck five-O 
So I say, keep your faith in the J
Saint Dog and great smokes a pack a day 
Keep your faith in the J, every day I pray 
Keep your faith in the J, man pass it this way

Everyday, there's more pain that comes my way 
And so I pray, the lord to take me away 
And if I lay, in the casket 6 feet deep 
I ask to be at ease and please don't mourn me",Everday,1999

The bakers man, bake me a cake as fast as you can
Polish up the krown then watch it shine
The Kottonmouth Kings are on the frontline

Fly rhymes, high times
Suburban Noize gotta be on the frontline
Zigzags, chronic sack
Nasty girls been ridin' with some big macks
Kickin verbs, smokin herbs
Just an everyday thing in the the suburbs
Bass high, treble low
Nothin' but some big west-coast juggalos

Now I take ten steps, turn and break out the hoop
Grip the zag tightly 'cause I'm about to shoot
Wind in my ear, the advisory I can see
Voices whisper clear, smoke another ST
So I do, I fire it up, round one round two, now I'm lifted up
Three, four can I stand and handle one more?
I'm in the sky, am I knockin' on heavens door?
Now I loaded up the clip and I pulled it through
And seen the little black hole that said I missed you
I can feel the expansion in my chest
I let go I'm stress free, there's no worries left
On this summer my mind travels as my eyes gloss
I reminisce about the days I hung with Big Hoss
And even though he's locked down man he still knows
That Saint Dog's got a love for his big bro
I gotta go

Goin', goin', gone that's it just blazed my last sack
Case to the head so I can see black
So yo that's that pack me another rip
So I can lay back and let my mind start to trip
By me D-Loc, call me stoner of the crew
If your fuckin' with my stash then I'm fuckin' with you

Mary Jane, she's my girl
Nowadays seems like the bitch rules my world
And every time our lips meet
She got's me loungin' like a leaf on a bud tree

Now I like to stay high, I got the old-school ride
77' bug and it's white on the outside
But on the inside its full of bitches
An ounce of herb, and seventeen switches

Who's that drunk that slurs and spits? (Saint)
Who gets trashed and likes to talk some shit? (Saint)
Get me on a skate and I bust a heel flip
Man I speak with dirt slang and I just can't quit it

Well I'm D Loc-er, the late night toker
Royal flush, got you bluffin' like a game of poker
Sick sick, stylee, face is always smiley
I like to get high and live the life O' Riley

The sick fly still high dope style flow
When my clock strikes 12 ask me where I'm gonna go

Porn star lifestyle, so I said FUCK YOU!

I got 2 skateboards, I eat hash and spam
My uncle, my pops, they got it easy man
I got a girl that's down, I call her tikki doll
I like to get high and play dunk ball

She showed up, we got straight to the point 
Broke out the herb and we rolled a couple joints, 
then we all start blazing 
Next thing ya know, 3 joint rotation 
Before ya know it she was taking off her clothes

Here I go my mind starts jogging
And I know I shouldn't have been hogging, that indo,
I know everything's fogging
Its just another case of a man mind boggling

Back up off me, I need rooms to puff
Its saint dog, and I cant get enough
Rough, I smoke, so I like it going down
Were all getting lifted cause I just stole a pound
Two hits and pass, that's what saints yelling
But fuck that shit, I'm hitting till my minds jelling
And when I'm done, Ill head to flannagans
To play some pool and max with a couple friends
Grabbed a sack, its off to a local park
Break out the bong, pack it tight and let it spark
Windows up so the bugs getting fish bowled
And if you're in you cant escape the indo
Oh shit, its getting deep into my mind
I took seven hits off that bud called kind
Close my eyes, my mind starts jogging
Here I go again, man, I'm mind boggling

[Chorus]
I'ma get you so high,
I'ma make that ass fly,
Pack up the bong stand by,
I'ma get you so high

[Bridge]
Here I go my mind starts jogging
And I know I shouldn't have been hogging, that indo,
I know everything's fogging
Its just another case of a man mind boggling

Here I go reminiscing about the weekend
Taking time to remember where my shit has been
Dinner to dancing, fly girl romancing
Balling with the homies, smoking buds and relaxing
High fashion, is how I was smoking
Fuck the schwag weed, indo is what I'm toking
Spliff to my lips as I tilt my head back
Looking like a mack cause I'm down to blaze a sack
I said (inhale, exhale),
Kottonmouth hit so I said, ""that's swell""
Pass a tweak to the left, party buzz's set in
I need some fresh air because I'm high off that in
Walked towards the door but I didn't get far
High kicked in, I took a seat at the bar
As I look into the sky and the air starts smogging
Here I go again kid, Im mind boggling

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

Smoke sliffs, and live the life of Riley,
Stay high and be so damn smiley,
For then I wont worry about tomorrow,
Because tomorrow only brings pain and sorrow.

Here I go getting deep into my mind again
Thinking bout good times, smoking kind again
By myself so you say (man your hooked on chronic!)
Am I a stoner or a loner man I cant call,
In this cell-lock realm that I'm living in (dog chains?)
I got family members fiending from the cocaine
And loved ones locked up in prison
That's why I'm bailing, yelling, ""man fuck the system!""
All the pressures of this life get me frustrated
So I reach for the bong so I can get faded
I blaze a bowl hope it takes me to another level
To escape the pain and all my life's trouble
Close my eyes, and pray take the pain away
Ask the lord should I live to see another day

Rob Harris died, I guess that's one of life's little tests
Jason Thirsk took a bullet straight to the fucking chest
Monique Delgado my first real true love
Died at 23, now shes waiting for me up above
I grabbed a pipe, pack it tight, start hogging
Here I go again motherfucker my minds boggling!

[Chorus]

Smoke sliffs, and live the life of Riley,
Stay high and be so damn smiley,
For then I wont worry about tomorrow,
Because tomorrow only brings pain and sorrow.

Had this hole in my pocket so my sack hit the floor,
Now this ain't nothing new I've had these jeans for years,
Hopped into my bus and started banging the gears,
Took it on the redline then I slapped into,
Reached in-between my seats and I pulled out another brew,
But now I'm 5-0-2 it ain't the route for me,
So I grab some chicken littles from KFC,

I'ma go to Mickey D's get a burger with some cheese,
Discuss these plans how I'm flippin' these keys,

Gotta get out

My punk rock?s dirty, my hip hop?s clean
One side has rust the other triple beam
One side is crazy, phat the other?s pissed
And mean half of me?s got problems
The other lives a dream

Well, I'm bi-polar, I'm confused
Split personality, I don't know which to chose
One side is filthy rich, the other is dirt poor
Count me out a thousand times, I still come back for more

We barely just began but already you're done
Get your ass up off the couch and roll another for fun
'Cause I ain't even begun barely dented my stash
Open your eyes and grab a pipe or else it?s time for you to dash

Where you gonna go when it?s time to dash
Grab your sack, don't forget your cash
Life moves fast gotta chose your path
Live while you live 'cause it might be your last

Watch your back it might be over
Sometimes I feel bi-polar
I get confused I don't know where to go
So I stop, slow the tempo

I ain't got hours in my day to smoke with people like you
Wastin' my minutes like a cell phone that you merely abuse
With crooked views at first, I questioned and these unpaid dues
Confuse me not, no second guessin' session veterans never lose

Grab your pipe 'cause you look confused
Rockin' the mic with your unpaid dues
Life?s a bitch we win or lose
How many people don't got a clue
Don't got a clue gotta figure it out

Kottonmouth Kings will put it in your mouth
Eeh haw, don't feed the donkeys me and my honkeys
Smoke that sonkey
Yer done, go to bed, pipe it, bye

Got nothin'
Got nothing to say

The system is full of sharks, the water?s not that deep
A bunch of dirty sharks are snapping at my sleeve
Their poisoning my weed, I think I'm gonna bleed
And now I'm gonna jump

Split personality, I don't know which to chose
One side is filthy rich, the other is dirt poor
Count me out a thousand times, I still come back for more

Suburbs surprise open your eyes and get a grip on your scene
Realize your life?s alive and not a fairytale dream
Most comfortable with slow flow shows, how I like my things
And never pass a packed bowl, unless you know there's some green

Like whoa, burning to the floor
I'm feelin' faded give me some more
Drank a beer and rolled a splif
I do what I do you suck my dick

If you don't like it I don't give a fuck
I just took a shit and I just threw up
Blow it out your butt and out my throat
I choke and slow the tempo

Going, going, gone just put it out of the park
Another win for home team just put the bite with our bark
Just brought some light to the dark another dot hit the mark
You'll never get your bowl burnin' if you don't got the spark

Pick it back up 'cause you might get piped
Slow your roll, put your shoes on tight
Too much smokin' you might get done
I'm done, nothin' no one

The other side full of love

I wanna climb waterfalls all day

I wanna break the open sky with my psychedelic eye
I wanna ride around the world today
And if I never make it home, I know my soul is gonna roam
I'm gonna ride until my dying day

Ridin' till my dying daze
Ridin' till my dying daze
Ridin' till my dying daze
Ridin' till my dying daze

I've been all around the world from the east to the west
Japan to L.A., I said, ""Damn, take a breath""
Livin' life fast put the rest in the past
Till my dying daze I'll go ridin' to the last

And until my dying days, I'm living life to the fullest
Staring at the ripcord wondering when I should pull it
Thinkin' I wanna stop but no I gotta go faster
Gonna go till I'm broke then throw me out to pasture

Alright Johnny Ric' need to stick to the picture
Knowin' damn well how we flip these scriptures
The beats gonna hit ya, ya feel that vibe
It's a dance hall funk with the punk rock rhyme

So get down to pit 'cause it's gonna explode
Circle gonna blow from the first distant go
Whether hittin' 5th wide or chargin' 12 step
Gaps, that's it when you commit 'cause there's no turning back
That's it when you commit 'cause there's no turning back
That's it when you commit 'cause there's no turning back

Ridin' till my dying, ridin' till my dying daze
Dying daze, dying daze, dying daze
Ridin' till my dying daze

I'm sick of watchin' birds spill, I'm sick of chasin' dollar bills
I'm sick of systems tryin' to seal my fate
I'd rather taste the sunshine with some endo in my ride
I wanna climb waterfalls all day

I wanna break the open sky with my psychedelic eye
I wanna ride around the world today
And if I never make it home, I know my soul is gonna roam
I'm gonna ride until my dying day

Ridin' till my dying daze
Ridin' till my dying daze
Ridin' till my dying daze
Ridin' till my dying daze

Last chance gotta chose a path
Either hit the brakes or give a fist full of gas
Give a last push on hope your pegs on tight
'Cause loose screws won't do in the middle of flight

Naw, get it right doc you know Loc, Loc rocked it
Every time I spit you know it sits in the pocket
We the hot topic like dub for sale
D-Loc and Johnny Richter got it wrapped in the mail

We were sent first class signed sealed and inked
Overnight express with all the free drinks
What'd you really think didn't know bout the team
You know, you wish you would've known we rolled 15 deep

Johnny Ric', Daddy X, Big Pak, and Loc
Dog Boy, Bobby be and Lou Dog's fro
On the road doin' shows with Munchey's clothes
And everybody knows that I spit these flows
Everybody knows that I spit these flows
Everybody knows that I spit these flows

Ridin' till my dying, ridin' till my dying daze
Dying daze, dying daze

Dying daze

Sweetheart 
I will do you right 
I can make you feel so good 
I'm in the mood to make love tonight",Intro,2001
Kottonmouth Kings,"Hey hit this motherfucker
Hit that shit, hit that bitch
It's 4:20.. 
We got love.. 
Is this motherfucker on?

At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Chronic sticks in the door
Visions of bongs being burned
D-loc just call me a stoner

A paranoid smoker with my finger on my poker
People puffin stress ain't living right
But I ain't going out without my pipe
See every time I pull a load, I start sweatin, smoke starts coming out my nose

There's somebody slaggin some sacks 
But I don't know who it is so I'm watching my back
It's a cop and he's deep undercover
When I toke I won't see the motherfuckers

[Unknown] Caddy like our own 
A sack of fruit and a bong like my own
Some might say, take a chill D
But fuck that shit there's a pig trying to diss me

I popped in the rip of my indo
Every 20 seconds I be smoking another bowl
Investigating joints for traps
Checkin my herb for a branch

I'm staring at my girl on the corner
It's fucked up when my mind's playing tricks on her 

I got a big afro
I drive old cars
Ain't nobody roll like me
It's like I'm a movie star

But late at night something ain't right
Somebody's coming in and they taking all my grow lights
Is it that dude tryin' to steal all my crops
Or could it be the one that sold the hydroponic rocks

Or is it that one claimin' he had the power
Tryin' to grow herb but it was hemp pure and flower
Reach under my seat grabbed
[Unknown] ain't no use to me [Unknown]

They were ? than a motherfucker
Transplant complete and I told them all 65 days and that shit will be done with
Ounce nugs just like I figured
Cannabis cup, kings blend is the winner

And what I saw make your head start wrigglin
Three rip cripplin stoney senior citizens
I live by the bud
I take my clones everywhere I go because I'm paranoid

I keep looking over my shoulder, peeping around corners
My mind's playing tricks on me

Day by day its more impossible to cope
Daddy X smokin off pounds of dope
Can't keep a steady hand because I'm nervous
Slanging buds, got a door to door service

Knee deep in the motherfuckin business
Cold hearted with no room for forgiveness
I got ? about 3 in each ? prop 215 fuckin me down in O.C.
The punk claimed that he knew Johnny Richter

Something about his x girl that he dicked her
I got phat sounds in my ride
Way too many friends that have died
I got a baby girl to look after
I play the role like a motherfuckin actor

Big daddy plant seeds in my wife
Plan on being down for life
Got the baddest bitch in the whole city
With 2 fat big brown big ass titties

And they the types I be suckin on
D-loc come and pack up my zong
My motherfucking sacks' getting lonely
My minds playing tricks on me

I'm feeling high my sacks getting lonely
Goddamn homie, my minds playing tricks on me

This year 420 fell on a weekend
Kottonmouth Kings is trick or treating
Robbin' little kids for sacks
[Unknown] got behind our ass

Broke the fuck out and said late
Skate to my house sucker sittin down by my gate
We were in for a session no doubt
Reached in my pocket you know what I pulled out
The G13 then the zong was delivered

But this battle just called for something bigger
A bong about six or seven feet
A specialty piece I envisioned in my sleep
Pulled out the triple beam on em

Dropping them motherfuckin Gs on em
The more I smoke the more high I grew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like fiend

The shit was brown, man it wasn't even green
I was high as fuck in the street
And to top it all off I broke my zong on the concrete

Check out this kottonmouth king
Too rude for that shit
Dog boy, come inside

In the aftermay of the bed to won
We celebrate, with the rising sun
The summers dry, God got me on the run
And we won't stop, until the war is won

because we strong, like a green breate
Special forces for peace and unity

because we strong, like a green breate
Special forces for peace and unity

Day to day, song by the song the battle rages on
????soul mighty power up my zong
When I think bout home
when I'm wonderin' why
How'd I end upon this road
It's the effect of my life, why

Like a fugitve were on the run
Runin' like were runnin the gun
You know we do it all for you
But on the run to war is won
I work and done
You know I'd rather be with you

On the road doin' shows
My lifes been crazy 
For the past five years it's been me and my lady
Only good things come to those who truly believe
All the time I spent alone, 
never thought I would leave
Now the life I live and learn 
I ain't takin' nothin' back
With the things that has happened
That be makin' me sad
Another day goes by
Gotta show respect
With the love that I get and I don't regret

Another town pound another show we must erect
Another day closer to being home again
With the tears, blood and sweat
The sacrafices made, there were fans in PA
That we wanted to play
But before gettin' paid
Way back when we were dreamin'
When we worked the nine to five
Cover up the triple beamer
When I never thought I'd leavin'
Have you always by myside
How'd I end upon this road
It's the effect of my life, why

Like a fugitve were on the run
Runnin' like were runnin' the gun
You know we do it all for you
But on the run to war is won
I work and done
You know I'd rather be with you

Can't stop our ?bowls? penetratin our zone
The freedom fight song
multiplyin' like clones
Everydays a new day
Gettin high feelin' lovely
Light the ?fire? so it rise above me

Treated us right
The mood is wrong
It's the people who fight
Sing this song
So everybody unite
Freedom fighters keep pushin' on

In the aftermay of the bed to won
We celebrate, with the risin' sun
The summers dry, God got me on the run
And we won't stop, until the war is won

Because run for miles, miles never tire
With love of the people you know were inspired, inspired

We sing this song
So the people unite
Freedom fighters fight on

Like a fugitve were on the run
Runnin' like were runnin' the gun
You know we do it all for you
But on the run to war is won

Now why you gotta cramp my style
You kep fuckin' with my high now I'm bout to get wild
Now why you gotta harass the pot dealer
Harass the people at expired parking meters
Why you gotta pull me over
As if I was the dude in the stolen Nova
Now why you gotta badge on your chest
Sting gun on your hip 
and a bulletproof vest
Now why you gotta act like you save the people
You front and you kid just so we can feel equal
Now why you gotta read me my rights
Would you read 'em to your wife
Fuck no Jesus Christ
Now why you gotta hang cuff me tight
In the middle of the night 
Treat me like a murder type
Now why you gotta, gotta, gotta nuttin
Gotta get out my face
Bitch I know you like Dunkins

Tell me why
You want to fuck with me

No time for negivitity

To the men,women and children
That are catchin or feelin'
Know what I'm dealin what is delt with
Felt up in the melt
The laws ???????? flowin liquidfying lava
We could be makin it harder
Listen up and try to follow
Now, Why you gotta pull me over in my van
Give a ticket for gram it cost bout a grand
And why you gotta slow the fuck out your roll
I know I'm not speedin I'm in cruise control
So now you gotta find another reason why
You can stop flashin your lights 
don't have to viloate my rights ah
No you don't have let me say your alone
Pigs bust in your home guns drawn to your dome
Why you gotta have a chip on your shoulder
passed the ?????? test I said I was sobber
I thought I told ya don't try to pull this on me
I know between procedure and police brutality
So tell me why, you insult me and gain stupidity
Why you think your smarter cause you GED

Always tryin plan shit, Let me get a witness
Its gettin serious and funny to me
Another day another ticket takin money from me
Now they'd try to pull us over 
cause were bangin the bus
The Fish, Johnny Richter, myself and The Judge
Who can you trust when the worlds crupt
Its got the crokked ass cops that put my ass in cuffs

Whys the police always stressin other people
They say protect and serve yet the never treat us equal
All across the nation people strivin to be equal
Another uprisin they don't want to see the sequal
Why you think you don't need no invitation
They rushed up in my house it was a fucked up situation
Tearin' up my pad searchin for the cultivation
Justified these actions through your racist legislation

The thinker can't remember ever slippin in some shit
Windin up behind some bars with purple rings around my wrists
Havin' to wait 10 hours just to take a fuckin piss
When your name is just a number as a person you don't exist
When you realize that no one really gives a fuck
When you finally realize when you start to get back up
To many people I know for bullshit got locked up
To many times I asked why so now I gotta say wha

Tell me why
You want to fuck with me
(why you gotta)
Is it because I'm a Kottonmouth King

No time for negitivity
So tell me why its always you against me

The air that we breathe and the highest mountain peak
Bring truth from your soul to your mouth when you speak

No need to get loud .. messin with others, stressin' your brother, it's time to uncover
Time to choose another path you see
Cause the road most traveled's negativity
Put your fist down (fist down), throw your hands in the air
Respect yourself, be somebody who cares
Don't let life get you down, don't feel abused
Keep a positive view unto yourself be true

[Chorus]

Everyday's a new adventure You got to keep what you got
Livin' life in a studio bustin' rhymes in my socks
I got to keep my head up and always do what I feel
Avoidin all the evil and just keeping it real
(I need some positive vibes)
All these situations I keep hearin' about
People dyin' in planes and buildings crumbling down
This world goes round for no apparent reason
People robbin and theavin' just to feel good for the evening
(I need some positive vibes)
What happen' to everybody's peace and love
Throw your drinks the sky, raise your hands up above
Get yo hand out of the gutter and be respectful
We need some positive vibes for these rainy days so let it go
Don't never get it twisted when I'm on this track
D-Loc the kind kid that be kickin' it back
Of the class everyday I was high
Goin to school in 95 easy that how we ride

[chorus]

It's time to leave this rat race track down Babylon
Keep my head straight, keep my family movin' on
Find my own pace, create my own space
Detach my whole scene from this wicked rat race
These two-faced friends, the snakes in the grass
Daddy always told me there'd be men like that
So watch your own back keep your eye on your stash
Don't ever write a check that that ass can't cash

[Chorus]

We need some positive vibes
(Keep on reaching for it)
For these rainy days
(Keep on hoping for it)
Let the sun come out keep pushin' these clouds away
(What we need is, all we have is positive vibes)
We need some positive vibes
(What more can we say to you)
Life's for fun so go out and play
(What more can be said to you)
Let the Sunlight in, brighten up your day

When I look in the mirror I feel so low 
I see my eyes and I feel the glow
I know I can make do let's bless the sole
Show my love and let myself go wow
Everybody knows that I spit these flows and I drink my beer smoke my weed

The way to the core where the soul can stay true – where I can walk free with a joint in my hand

Now when the love is lost and your spirits are low
The world's closing in around you got no place to go
Done all that you could to ease and please another soul
And in the end you're in the cold, another sad story told
That's why I make my own decisions on how I'm liven
Try to get by with the knowledge that I'm given
Can't make me believe cause a tree is a tree

remember me? You don't? You will...
Fuck you, Fuck all the people always runnin their mouth
Fuck that bitch ass coward who fuckin flooded my house
Fuck everybody who said this shit here would never happen
Now who's laughin you said we'd never make it by rappin
But you was dead wrong this song was made to strictly prove a point
See my dick, well you can lick it as I fire up this joint
Gettin me pissed off will definitely get you shit on
Don't turn your back on the Kings, our team's too fuckin strong

Be the second loced loady settin it off in the session
There be no second guessin D-Loc is who you slept on
Don't get confused when I step into your realm
Watch me shine my crown now let's really get down
Turn a smile to a frown
Gives a fuck about a hater
Cause I be the one that might sit back and play ya!
Maken moves in the game
Wit my D-Loc shielo, and if you don't know then Ah! Now
Ya! Know.

[Chorus]
We're the ones that you all slept on- Talk shit you might get crept on
Grow lights is always kept on- We're the ones the whole world slept on
Woof woof- Your diggy diggy dead wrong
Talk that shit you might get crept on get flexed on get stepped on
We're the ones the whole world slept on... 
""Don't sleep on us""

Be the third king swingin comin rushin out the bus checkin nuts motherfucker
Back the fuck up

Wake the Fuck up
You see what's going on
You got some kids form the burbs
And they're singing these types of song
Everybody getting scared
You can't shake the Kings
We got that underground phunk
So matha fucka please
Now sit back look and listen
While I smoke on my bud
I seen you kissen ass fag
Should have shown me the love
In the middle of the club you could of
dabed my hand and gave me respect
Like a matha fuckin man
Who's a bitch now?
You should have never slept on my crew
And it's rude how all these whacked groups
Are settin played and I'm amused
With the defected youth confused
Sittin back laughing drinkin beer in two's
With my pants saggin D-Loc matha fuckas.

[Chorus]

I've had all that I can take no more room to give
From the pressures growing up, the pain I felt as a kid
Six schools in one year, shit, I've been shipped around
Now I ain't never backin down I'll fight and die for my krown
See all these pussies talk a lot but ain't got shit to show for it
I got 2 dirtbikes, a halfpipe, and a new truck you stupid fucks
Still roll the bus, and I do run your clubs
You can't kick a King out, cause we level's above
Well connected to the top, all it takes a phone call
And that will be the end of you, your eternal downfall
Was to step and start barkin bout the wrong fucking band
Should have shut your fuckin mouth, should have tried to understand

you dead wrong you slept on us ? wake up now ? 'cause we callin Come creepin ?

Just drop in a dime and tell him about this party
There'll be a lotta beer and some naughty hotties

Taste that kind of breeze, Saint your ass is through
Break out the beer bong man I want to get faded

I feel too ripped, I felt a finger in my back
""Hey I like your shirt"", yeah I see it is quite phat
But no time to mack 'cause Saint's drunk as hell
He was standin' on the table and he started to yell
""All the freaks up in the party
Move around and shake your body
And if you're down with the boys of P-Town
Lemme see somebody get naughty
Is the west coast in the house?
Well pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!""
Well get naughty they did and these girls start to strip
Started freakin' on my shit and her boyfriend tried to trip

Trying to run up in my life, and tell me what to do
You need to arrest your son, because he's selling pounds of weed
He's getting over on you, and you're stupid enough not to see

You ask, how much money have I spent buying weed?
Not at much as I spend on important legal fees
You wouldn't believe how much it costs to be free
A couple of G's every time they find a roach on me
Shit, I never learn, the lesson they teach
Do the robot (??) When they pull the gun and say ""freeze""
Get off these, you're the one being thieves
Take away my rights and detach my salaries

Yo, I'mma keep baling, fuck the police
Alcohol is legal need to legalize weed
I know they know, so what's the problem?
You got the gun, I got the plant that's how we solve em

You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, who's the criminal?
Take's me to plant my seeds all across the land, across the land
Mr. Officer man, police officer man, with the gun in your hand (hey hey hey hey)
Freedom of the plant, as we came to take a stand, take a stand

why'know I never understand them nigga stands on the plant
While it grows on a branch, holding a gun in yo' hand?
Cause more people on the earth, but illegal it's absurd
What's more evil a weapon or some herb?

Yo, relax and kick back, worry about real crimes
Smoking a plant? You're out your fuckin' mind
Gimme a break, yo ass fake as fake
Faker then the people putting food on your plate

Stop that, drop that, give me that mic
Rough me, cuff me, read me my rights
No work higher, born and bred, black boots, billy clubs on my head
Fuck you, fuck me, fuck that shit
Legalize freedom celebrate gods gift

You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, who's the criminal?
You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, rahhhhh!
Mr. Officer man, police officer man, with the gun in your hand (hey hey hey hey)
Officer man, police officer man, with the gun in your hand (hey hey hey hey)
Protect and serve, slap my face that must be illegal sir
Fingers in my cavity? It struck a nerve
Now I'm on Apollo (?) street now I'm saved
(No Idea what he says here, just random yelling me thinks)
You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, who's the criminal?
You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, rahhhh!
Swear to god, smoke on one with the law but it was mad
Never thought that he had it, but he used mace (?)
Hit me with his billy club it's just a plant
(No idea again)
You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, who's the criminal?
You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, rahhhhh!

Do you even really know what cha fighting for?

Let the sun shine
All I wanna do is live this beautiful life,
Feel free wit my girl,
My friends and family,
Spread my peace and love and truth and unity,
Tryin to stop all the violence and the wars over sea's,
People come people go,
I know this lifes a trip
But I cant be depressed over someone elses nonsense
The bong tokin' alcoholics theres no reason or time for me to be mad or sad,
So do you even really know?

Some like peace and some like war,

And I hope all the soldiers come back safe real soon,
We got peoples being fought on the streets everyday,
Wile the rich fill there pockets and the po(poor) just pay,
Uhh,im fightin for love and fightin for life,
Against those doing wrong and for those doing right,
Yea, for my family and my future to come,
Cause if I don't fight now there just might not be one.

Oh oh

Oh

You see I can see light in the strangest ways,
On the darkest nights and the coldest days,
And im amazed that some how that I can keep smilin,
I can hear music in the depths of silence,
I can find peace in the middle of violence
And I can be calm when I should be wild
And I can find hope when there is despair
And I don't feel alone when there's no one there.

Some like sunshine some like rain,
Some like pleasure and some like pain,
Some like peace and some like war,
And some don't even know what there fightin' for
What your fightin' for?

The revolution will not be televised
I repeat, the revolution will not be televised

I say you're wrong
You destroy lives, you build up bombs
Spin all your lies, I say we're spun

You call it war, it's just begun

We fight with thoughts, you fight with guns
You make the laws, fill all the jails

Fill us with fear, that's where you failed

Corrupting, controlling us all with their
Lies, the bombs keep exploding
The earth is eroding

They keep on reloading, and firing lies
Stand at salute and then cheer
When they shoot down my lady [unverified]
So what will it take for this whole thing to break

For People to awake and realize, it's all lies
They got us believing, but always deceiving
And what we're receiving, is nothing but lies
We need to increase peace, we need to stop all the wars

Innocent people are dying for no reason, what for?
Lies, the shit we keep making
The bombs we keep dropping
We're killing each other

We're the people who could stop them
Who're they trying to fool?
We the leaders of the new school
We fight for our rights

Realize the governments full of lies
Don't ask us why, you can see it in our eyes
Who is he? Who is she?
You got me screaming to myself

Lies, smile in your face while they're laughing inside
Tell you what you wanna hear but its all a bunch of lies, lies
Tax type, no hope for senior citizens, social security
And health benefits being questioned

Its all bullshit, it's just a big scam
Uncle Sam got us fighting family wars on foreign land
Mass destruction, where they at?
How many soldiers gotta die before we bring America's kids back?

This is a freedom song, songs of freedom
Stand up for your rights, right means not wrong
One life, one chance, one earth, one people
You decide

Right, you say you're right
I say you're wrong
You destroy lives, you build up bombs
Spin all your lies, I say we're spun

Burnin bridges when they should be mended more
He's only at the top cause everybodys after you
You gotta watch your back yeah that's what you gotta do
Business and personal shit
Learn how to split well
Too many motherfuckers actin fake
Go to hell

Take my hand, we're going for a ride
You and me, we both got each other
In this life, depend on no other
That's the way that it's supposed to be
Me for you and only you for me

You help me see so many beautiful things
Open my eyes, made me constant on my surroundings
Help me think before I speak, you put my mind at ease
When I had you by my side, I was truly a king
Unstoppable together, we're like Bonnie and Clyde
Damn I miss my aunt, I wish she was still alive
Nothin to do with the song, but her name was Bonnie
I still miss her to this day, but this simply is beyond me
Can't change the past, that's a lesson I learned
Cause when you're down and out, your family is the only place to turn
Believe me, cause I know, been down that road and crashed
It feels so good to know I have someone to make me laugh
Complete I'm feelin, you're the reason I do
No one, there's no way I could ever repay you
Priceless in my eyes, you're my diamond in the rough
I promise to be here forever, I ain't never givin up

You went from a seed to be fully grown
Expanding perfectly right before my eyes
I love to see your face everyday when I rise
You're like a pool of water, rainbows and blue skies
You're my beautiful daughter, help me realize
My true potential, to love with real life
I could be high forever with you by my side
I know its not easy goin through rough waters
But I try to love your mom like a real man oughtta
Teach you respect and how you should be treated
Sacrifice today like the miles between us
It might sound corny puttin this in a song
But its my gift to you to carry all life long
And one day, we'll look back and laugh
You was three years old, signing autographs

My soon to be, my life my everything
My little miss princess from around the way
Dear, honestly, I got somethin' to say
I been wantin' to write you a letter
But I think it would sound better
If I put it in song form, okay
First of all, I just wanna thank you for being you
You know, the way you look, the way you feel, your touch
It's so real, we gettin' stronger as the days pass by
I can still remember when you cried for the first time in my arms (yeah)
I was right there to make you strong
We been datin' for awhile now, and there ain't no lookin' back
We fight a couple times, but I still got your back
We built a bond together, it's me and you

That's right
Just me and you, just me and you
All I wanna",Forever,2006
Kottonmouth Kings,"[Chorus]
It don't matter where you've been
Just focus on where you're going
Most people you think are friends
Ain't there when the tough gets going
Remember to keep your friends
Be wise with those you've chosen
Cause only your closest friends
Are there when the going gets tough

When I think about it the definition change
Back in the old days it wasn't quite the same
Or maybe it was but on another level
Still pushing dirt with a different type of shovel
Loyalty, trust, unconditional foundation
Builds everlasting bonds and relations
I've got friends I haven't seen in years
I'd die for tonight forget and have a couple beers
On the other hand you never know where you stand
With certain types of friends they'll sell you out for some ends
Or some pussy or some weed or a business transaction
Some use words but I prefer action
I'm a break you off like an old school player
My x-ray vision helps me see through the layers
Of you fakes, phonies, lies and deception
Ask Matt Hall if you need a life lesson

[Chorus]

I've been all around the world and I met a lot of people
These fakes and phonies yo these cats I see through
Dickheads and homies some others glad to meet you
You better give respect to the ones that believed you
And were there by your side when the going got tough
And had your back when you got to fuck someone up
And lent you a buck when you was broke and hungry
And gave you a place to sleep living in their luxury
Big Up to Chucky that's my dog for real though
What up to Judge D since back in junior high school
Johnny Rich? that's my man Mr. Brando
My partner in crime with the gangsta flow
Daddy X, Big Pak, be, Lou, Munch, Kev, Flo
Cause if ya don't know now you know
Fuck the rest
What's up though
P.S. to my shoulder blade Alison Marie
What up baby
Fuck what yall think

[Chorus]

To make it in this life you got to know who your friends
Your boys, your dogs, the ones with you til the end
The ones that never crack it, they never even bend
I mean like when your ass is broke they got the money to lend
The type that when you need a ride they give you the car
You don't worry about them running cause they'll always stand hard
Late night, can't drive, man you never too far
Barbecue by the pool chilling in the back yard
Stepping out on a Friday never leave you behind
The first to call you up when they're hitting the kind
None the less don't stress cause it'll always be fine
Like everything I got is yours and what you got is mine
Walk in the front door like they own the crib
But hey, what's theirs is yours and what's yours is theirs
I can't explain it no better that's just how it goes
Real friends can't be bought it's got to come from the soul so

[Chorus]",Friends,2006
Kottonmouth Kings,"Put your money where your mouth is D-Loc ain't playing
I know cats like you that are broke just claiming
Ain't saying nothing just flapping your lips
Just running your mouth because you can talk some shit
Ain't got nothing to show for busting cool ass raps
But that's cool with me dog where your money at
I'm talking about the hustle even if your fresh see you're wack
I get paid homey rubber band man stacks

Give me a five and I'll make it a twenty
Give me a fifty and I'll turn into a couple a hunnies
Give me ten G's and I'll show you what I can do
Johnny Richter's on the hustle and we grabbing loot
I used to slang and serve sacks on a day to day basis
Now I serve and slang raps fill my beats with bass
It's a game it's a hustle we all paper chasing
On the road for two months coming home with bacon

[Chorus]
You can't stop our hustle
You can't stop this
You can't stop our hustle
Don't even try kid
You can't stop our hustle
We world wide now
You can't stop our hustle
Koast II Koast blaow
You can't stop our hustle
The game's all the same
You can't stop our hustle
Just trying to make some change
You can't stop our hustle
It's time to build the stacks
You can't stop our hustle
So where the hustlers at

Everybody knows I got cops on the payroll
So just lay low until I say so
When that whistle blow we'll all be splitting dough
Nobody act dumb until the orders come
There will be enough cheese to spread for everyone
Making legal money and the feds hate it
Real underdogs most underrated
We got the underground locked branded and spaded

Watch me get my boogie on and flex this muscle
Ten years later D-Loc still on the hustle
I'm a get my grind on dig them out with a shovel
Keep stacking my chips then watch my ends bubble
Let the double double stack them up to the ceiling
When this shit's all done with I'll be worth a million
Watch me shine just let me smoke this bud
Let me drink this cocktail I feel like getting' fucked up

[Chorus]

I'm gonna hustle until the wheels fall off
Keep on going out for mine never punching a clock
Ã???Cause the hustle don't stop the game waits for nobody
Just trying to make some cash like my last name was Gotti
Stay on the grind like Independent trucks
Fifty fifty five-o let me know what's up
And you can still catch me on the streets of P-Town
I can still add sacks all the way to a pound

Don't matter none what you say or what you do
Throw salt in the game but it's coming right back at you
Snitches and bitches dirty rats and double crossers
Fuck off we the underground bosses
Fuck off like Shaggy 2 Dope said
These are family ties we all breaking bread
Legendary
You eat crumbs from the table
Wipe your mouth you're dropped from the label

That's when I'm showing up yo so that's when the party begins
'Cause when I walk in the door the whole place goes bananas
I got party planners from California to Atlanta
Always got a moving camera for those girls gone bad
A couple Alabama slammers now they're calling me dad
Now this nights a definite success
'Cause there's a bunch of girls with some big old breasts
Which means a long line of people willing to pay
At twenty bucks a head for me a nice payday
And it don't stop until I pass out
Sorry if I don't know ya homie but you're assed out
This after party's at my house right now it's maxed out
You smell what I'm sizzlin' you know what I'm talking about
Where's the party!!!

[Chorus:]

Bounce
Boogie down skate high
Come dipping through the party around 12 'o'clock
Pants sagged hat cocked got some weed in my pocket
Walk up in the spot shit pop like rockets
Head straight to the bar so I get my drink on
Pound that shit quick and order another one
People taking pictures of D-Loc the dog
Bitches taking off their tops DJ playing my songs
Got my girl in my arms and we getting towed back
Kiss me on the neck rubbing on my nut sack
Got the back thong on 'cause she know I like that
Got my hand down her pants feeling down her ass crack
It's time to smoke a blunt 'cause we getting fucked up
Walking through the dance floor throwing shit up
All the homies is drunk and the records still spinning
When the DJ is done I'm a go home and fuck

[Chorus:]

Hey ladies you looking kind of sexy
I be smoking up that chronic not the mexi
You know that 'cause I'm King Daddy X see
Put you on the payroll and the party's never ending
It's like throwing gasoline on a fire
I own the club you don't need a fucking flyer
I thought you knew I had friends in high places
We should get together and exchange some fuck faces
Now that's exactly how I hooked up with my wifey
Now she's the only one left to entice me
Late night we got the party favors
Open up the stash box we got the thirty one flavors
Turn the music up forget about the neighbors
We getting fresh like a pack of Life Savers
Ever sat legs wide on a kings throne
It's over there girl make yourself right at home

Get up and take a stand
My life is in your hands
And that ain't right

(it ain't easy)
I don't want no complications, no isolation,(it ain't easy, no no)
I'm just doin my time
(it ain't easy)it ain't easy when your facin incarceration for a victimless crime(it ain't easy) 

Johnny Richter:

Now I've seen a lot of people who got it worse than me
Strugglin to survive, fightin just to feel free 
Incarcerated over dealin with a plant
Or standing up for themselves for dealin with the man
Its hard to think in a world of today
That people get locked away for a victimless crime
Doin serious time we must be out of our minds
We need to stand up and get the laws refined
Its up to us to stop writtin the tracks
Start demanding the facts make the right decision
A country run by the people was americas vision
A democratic society where we're in a position
That's why we have the right to vote
But look what happened
We legalize weed and the governments laughin
Bush is still in office so we still in iraq
We need to open up our eyes and take the power back

(chorus)

Daddy X:

I served my time like a man
Get up and take a stand
My life is in your hands
And that ain't right

in this world its all contained
From time to time we all make mistakes
Sometimes in life you can't catch a break
Living hand to mouth going day to day
And your personal lives start to get you down
And there's not enough goodness to spread around
All the views of the world start sleepin in
And the sides of the walls start creepin in
Now your thinkin crazy thoughts of desperation
And your faced what you don't want to be facin
Situations, sticky situations
Freedom dead now incareration

(chorus)

D-Loc:

how come the government can send us to fight
But I can't do the things that I want like smoke a pipe
Its punishment, crazy and people lose their rights
Over something so simple that grows from the sky
Keep askin my self the same old questions
No answers just a bunch of complications
Its confusin but oh well
This lifes a trip with so many stories to tell

Bye.

One day I'll be floating in the sky flying like a bird looking down at you. Wonder why I'm up
Here
And I am not down there and all the people that I miss and the family the ones who really care.
Living through my music; living through my voice being loved every time someone grooves it.
One day is going to be the last time I hear my voice on the track.
Now one day not a worry in the world no stress no nothing just miss my girl
Now you tell me why we got to die if god creates us then he kills us at the same time.
Why do I ask myself why one day I'll be dead and gone and miss all the things that I love and
Adore?
I know I hurt when I see you there.

One day, one day, people will be walking on water.
One day, one day, the human race will never die.
One day, one day, we will fly around in flying saucers.
One day, one day, freedom will be legalized.
One day:one day:one day:

One day I am going to invent a new drug disconnect from the system just unplug.
Buy a pop gun; shoot a peace love drop a love bomb and give the world a hug.
One day I won't have to fear a cop, or a security guard what a dope beat drop.
One day I want to body surf a rainbow, swim through a room of clouds blow an end-o.
I want to elevate and unify mankind. Everybody is just walking in the sunshine.
One day there'll be a block party for the world and I'll never have to be away from my girl.
One day I plan a cherry orgasm infiltrate the atmosphere so everybody has one.
Come together, a global climax, just imagine a universal sun splash.

One day, one day, people will be walking on water.
One day, one day, the human race will never die.
One day, one day, we will fly around in flying saucers.
One day, one day, freedom will be legalized.
One day:one day:one day:

I hope one day people will say I was a good guy and every time they were around me I made them
Smile.
But in the close future I hope to raise my family in a society full of suburban noise families.
And So I hope one day soon we will make a change and when I'm dead I hope my life I didn't
Live in vain.
I know in my heart that I tried to live right and I will fight to the death until freedom is
Legalized.
Then I know one day my kids will have a chance to raise children of their own and own their
Own lands.
And when this day comes I hope I am still alive to see the dream we envision finally realized.
Yes one day I think we'll all recognize the government's a big pain infiltrated with lies.
And on this day we need to make a decision: we going to follow the blind or the people with
Vision?

It's funny thing too sometimes
On the road of life it's full of surprises
Twist and turns we look toward the sky for some guidance
The sun goes down and it rises
Withstood the sands of time
And we'll find new horizons

Sometimes I lay awake at night and try to figure it out
Is my life going north is it heading south
I'm walking on a fence between wrong and right
Trying to keep a level head try to keep my goals in sight
It's hard as hell in this world today friends
I've known for many years started acting strange
Things I cared about before seemed to just fade away
Now I'm left with these questions of today

""When is the train ganna get back on track
When am I even ganna care bout that
Why do I always get dealt the bad cards
Took the easy the road so long and now my life's hard""

Still I try to make it work out for the best
And I know I've gatta clean up all this mess
If I knew when I started where this all would end
I'd prolly do it all over again

I don't know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
I went from having a little to having a lot
I went from buying weed to growing pot

I don't know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
I've seen some people cry cause loved one's die
I've looked in people's eyes and told some lies (yeah)

Skies are blue and the trees are grand
Going to the place where life froze in between
The beautiful hills mountains and streams
The Man's country with my women living free
Stay on my path follow my road
Do all the right things to achieve my goals
Perusing my dream in life I lead
Become who I want when I want anytime I please
I no where I'm going
If I keep it on track
Just stay on my line only time will tell
I pray to the one over looking my trail

[Chorus:]

I've been criticized
For speaking my mind
Been baptized in lies
Given bad advice
Here's a word to the wise
Never compromise
Watch your back
As you watch your ends multiply
Look a man in his eyes
And never ever say die
Keep your eye on the prize
And you'll stay on the rise
I'm a king world wide
And I'm going to stay on the ground
I've been behind the glass but I always rebound
Outlet quick live life in the fast lane

Kottonmouth Kings,"This one's dedicated, to the Big LT and the reality of life
Take a moment smoke a bowl, let's talk about life (What's that?)
Simply reality of life
Now death to the motherfucker that causes strife

R.I.P. Uncle Roy God bless your wife
R.I.P. Uncle Mark God bless your wife
I guess we can't call em in this life of the strife
Now my pops was there when Uncle Roy got buried

So my pops was there when Sheila got married
Represent for his brother AKA best friend
I was there for myself and Big Hoss in the pen
In this life of sin it takes me gin to get by, no lie

I steady blaze and forever stay high
Don't try to understand it, this life you can't plan it
Just don't take it for granted

Life, to live while you live
Death, to give what you get
Pain, the reality of change
I wonder whether, things will ever get better

Everday, there's more pain that comes my way
And so I pray, the Lord to take me away
And if I lay, in the casket 6 feet deep
I ask to be at ease and please don't mourn me

I picture life as a dream here today gone tomorrow
Love equals hollow, hate equals sorrow
Now follow the real as I take you to a field in my mind where I journey
Sucker bitches can't burn me, bring an attorney

'Cause since child birth I've been raised to do dirt on this earth
Yes it hurts
To find out that I can't get away from all the pressures and pain
And misfortunes that I've gained straight

Sometimes a fire grows inside, hatred starts to rise
Still I can't despise all the lies I've been told, the secrets they hold
The government control, man fuck five-O
So I say, keep your faith in the J, Saint Dog and great smokes a pack a day

Keep your faith in the J, every day I pray
Keep your faith in the J, man pass it this way

Everyday, there's more pain that comes my way
And so I pray, the Lord to take me away
And if I lay, in the casket 6 feet deep
I ask to be at ease and please don't mourn me",Everyday,2009
Kottonmouth Kings,"""Well good morning my friends, today we shall discuss the mushrooms
How many of you like mushrooms? Ah yes, very nice, very good
Now how many of you like psychedelic mushrooms? 
All right let's go find some
Form a single line behind me, walk slow 
(follow me kids, come one now, come on)
you can do this , let's go.""

What have these mushrooms all done to my mind
Running through the pines my head feels wrapped in twine
What have these mushrooms all done with my mind
Mushrooms I won't decline wash them down with wine

My life goes better with a mushroom
I seem like I'm in a better mood when I'm on a mushroom
Clouded up when I'm packing a boom clack clack kaboom
Get the maniac sounds of I wanna f*ckin' shrooma
It's bound to do ya, all I gotta say is oh no I'm starin' at a gobo
But it ain't my name I don't know my name so
Why the f*ck am I even tryna get a witness
Nobody hangin' out with a weird muthaf*cka like this
Like this... everybody make a fist
That be the size of the shroom that I ate
I am so high that I intoxicate, anybody lookin' at me in another way
Gonna get a watermelon thrown at them yep yep I got em
Oh f*ck can't feel my nose I can't feel my toes
I'm gonna lay down on them, I'm in a full meltdown trippin on the way
The tree blows and the way the wind caught them
It's time to come to grips I got a long time til I hit bottom bottom
Bottoming out on the trip and psychotically flowing on all the ju ju
I'm not them, I'm proud enough to get up out of this chair
I'm proud enough to stop pullin' my hair
I'm proud enough to get another mushroom outta my backpack
Yo sitting right there, gonna sit back close my eyes
For I gotta get a move on back to life
This is the re-up and now is the time
Mushrooms on my mind

What have these mushrooms all done to my mind
Going back in time floating on my ride
What have these mushrooms all done with my mind
Seeing purple lines swinging through on vines

How many kinds of the mushrooms have you really ate
I focus on eight comfortable ones that are no correlate
Yo, you never can't tell when you eat them
Poisonous or in salt don't eat them, treat em, do a lil' bit of thought
Freedom, freedom, fighter when I wanna fight, fight
When I'm in the night shade and I know I gotta eat them, eat them
I sit in my room and I bubble the water for tea
Quicker to get in the blood stream, quicker to trip on the light beam
Quicker to give it to y'all, dirtball you got me f*cked up
Why the f*ck you do this to us, didn't really wanna get this high
Why you gots to make me fry, look man feel bad but it ain't my fault
I'm the one over here yo stuck in a vault
Where the vault come from don't know
But I gotta put a halt to the mushroom god
Can't see a mutha f*ckin' thing like I'm in a fog
And nobody seemin to care that I'm dyin' a miserable death
With no one to call, no one to call and nowhere to fall, nowhere to fall
I'll leave it to y'all, you too can be tall
The thinner the fat the bigger the small, they call me the ball
I'm really the one that can give you the psilocybilic advice
Now won't that be nice?

As death rains down upon them
Cleansing the streets in a cloudburst of blood
Black leather smoke coils up my nostrils
Tingling with death's surprise

It leaks out through the cracks
In the cold asphalt sidewalks of the city of sin
Feast upon the images of molten massacre
As the machineries of death grind relentlessly on

Si hablo de amor... se que la extraño, de mis actos en vida soy dueño, pero me calla el dolor por el daño, es como un sueño dentro de otro sueño. Apuesto a pleno pero de callado, cada uno en la suya, yo ando rayado, sigo esperando sentado... que esta vez el destino no me deje plantado... que no me deje plantado... no nena.
Escuchame bien... no es chamuyo...es amor.

Didn?t need you girl anyway,ill be fine, 
Just as long the sun keep shining my way,
Ima be alright, ima be okay

Verse 1
You tell me you love me and you can?t get enough 
But then you call me and you tell me that were breaking up
Look what you do to me
Seems like you?re out to ruin me
And every time you lie, you make a fool of me
Change your ways girl, you?ll probably lose me
It?s not a game girl, cause you'll be losing 
A good thing and you don?t have to explain 
But you have to take responsibility for the pain, you gave me
I thought you?ll always be my lady
You told me to hold on, and like a fool I keep on waiting
It?s alright though, I'll find someone new
And if that?s the way you want it, then the choice is on you
But just remember that I didn?t need you around
I kept you cause I love you not for you to put me down, I bet you see now
How a man can grow strong and if loving you was wrong 
Then I got to move on.

(Chorus)
I overcame rainy days in my life, 
Didn?t need you girl anyway,ill be fine, 
Just as long the sun keep shining my way,
Ima be alright, ima be okay

Verse 2
I guess it wasn?t really meant to be 
But I?m glad it happened now cause it would happen eventually
It?s sad to see it didn?t end how I wanted
It?s sad to see I wasn?t the one you wanted
I guess I got to start over and try
Start with someone new, like a girl that won?t lie and break my heart like you did
It?s a shame, nobody ever made me feel the way that you did
I?m caught up in the middle of a feeling that I don't want to get rid off
But you take yourself away from me
And I can?t understand cause you?re still unhappy
Even though I tried my best to make you happy
You say I don?t deserve you, you don?t deserve me
You?re the type of girl that would do something just to hurt me
And yeah I guess it?s true I don?t know much about you
But I do know one thing that I?ll do better without you

I overcame rainy days in my life, 
Didn?t need you girl anyway,ill be fine, 
Just as long the sun keep shining my way,

Verse 3
You see I learned my lesson and the outcome was true
Even though you love someone, doesn?t mean they love you
So before you give yourself to someone else 
Make sure they love you and nobody else
And this I tell you so you don?t get hurt
A lot of men do know what a women is worth 
He would give up all his covers and sleep out in the rain
He would help her through her problems and take away your pain
I know
Cause that?s the type of man I am, 
I?m the type of man that would take a lady by your hand
And show her, that I wanna get to know her
Tell her that she?s beautiful and that I wanna hold her
Eventually, it all be that way and I?ll walk up to her and ask her her name
My name is Cuete 
It?s nice to meet you
I was wondering if one day I could kick it with you

And the Cry of the Bear
Awake, I can sense it
Still I'm afraid

Ka has come to me
Gray old fellow
If you finally failed the test
What would it mean?

We're getting near
We're getting near
Maid of sorrow
Your time goes by

Fade away
Fade

Say thank ya
For the beams are safe my friend
Long days and pleasant nights for you

Save me, the final chord
Don't let it end like this
No, not like this, tell me
When things were finally getting out of hand
It's out of hand

Entangled, I am captured
You have put a spell on me
The last in line
The Gunslinger's line

The sacrifice of innocence
This work needs to be done
Now blow the horn
Hail to the gun

Done is done
Yes, there will be no taking back
Every journey must come to an end
All hail to the Gunslinger
Praise to the Dinh and the King
Beyond our reach, out of control

Save me
To touch the rose it will not bring release
No taking back

Come save me
There are other worlds
But surely none like this
The world has changed

Done is done
Yes, there will be no taking back
The word is the law
Law is Ka

The end of the road lies
Straight ahead it lies
I'm feeling pure
The end of the road lies

The sacrifice of innocence
The hailing of the gun
My way was death and madness
Now let the tower come

Done is done
Yes, there will be no taking back
Every journey must come to an end
All hail to the Gunslinger
Praise to the Dinh and the King
Beyond our reach, out of control

You are slowly falling down
Down and down into the deep
You are living from dreams
Dreams and dreams, till the end

It is better not to see through the eyes
It is better to be open minded
Everything is so far away
When you want to find that

You are walking down the streets
You are feeling so much blind
Are you stranger in your mind?
Are you thinking how to die?
Die...by this way of dying

Liquid, in your mind
Liquid, you can fly
Liquid sweet dreams
Sweet dreams...till the end

[Verse 3]
You are waiting for help
Help and help from an angel
You are screaming into the night
Night and night, this is the danger

It is better not to see through the eyes
It is better to be open minded
Everything is so far away

Ich hab' seit Tagen nicht geschlafen
Bin ich verliebt oder kommt das Herzrasen vielleicht doch vom vielen Speed?
Die Platte voller Blei, egal ab in die Bong
Ich knall mir alles rein, was mir in die Finger kommt

Ein bitterer Geschmack läuft den Rachen hinab
Was geht ab?

Die ganze Stadt trägt Sonnenbrille in der Nacht und es geht

Da, wo die Liebe hinfällt

Davon, dass du jetzt zusammen bist
Mit meinem besten Freund?
Aber nicht doch
Ich würde nie sagen, „Ich hasse dich“
Du hast mein Leben zerstört
Ja, aber macht doch nichts
Bringt ja kei'm was
Nein, Quatsch, weißt du was?
Ja genau
Die Erde dreht sich immer weiter, Schatz
Du hast doch ständig gesagt
„Schreib mir mal ein Lied!
Einfach so, um mir zu zeigen
Wie sehr du mich liebst.“
Na dann dreh mal die Anlage auf
Geh raus auf den Balkon
Breit' die Arme aus
Und sing zu deinem Song

Du hast einfach immer recht
Und wichtig ist auch beide Seiten zu sehen
War ja auch nicht alles schlecht
Da muss keiner leiden, nur weil wir uns streiten
Das lässt sich ja vermeiden
Keiner der Freunde muss sich entscheiden
Zwischen uns beiden, wir sind nicht mehr dreizehn
Ich will ja gar nix sagen
Ich bin nicht nachtragend
Du bekommst den Hund
Und von mir aus kannst du auch die ganze Wohnung haben
Und ja es stimmt
Dass ich vielleicht etwas konfliktscheu bin
Aber immerhin
Fick' ich nicht mit deinen Freundinnen
Du hoffst nur, dass ich weiß:
In deinem Herzen hab' ich immer einen Platz
Ist ja geil endlich was gemeinsam
Mit jedem ander'n Wichser in der Stadt
Wir beide hatten nie ein Lied
Einen Song, der uns verbindet
Jetzt haben wir diesen hier
Ich bin gespannt wie du ihn findest

Can't seem to shake off feeling strange
All my emotions rearranged
I'm twisted up inside
You give me butterflies
There's something in your eyes, and now I know that

I'm in love with you, in love with you, in love with you
I'm in love with you, in love with you, in love with you

I can't remember what I said
Too many thoughts went through my head
If I believe this love is real
I should show you how I feel
I'm twisted up inside
You give me butterflies
There's something in your eyes, and now I know that

I'm in love with you, in love with you, in love with you
I'm in love with you, in love with you, in love with you",In Love With You [Inst./Acapella],2007
Kraka Lovers,"Io ti guarderò 
Illuminata con il neon 
Delle vetrine 
Poi ti nutrirò di coca- 
Cola e di popcorn 
Dentro ad un cine 
Ti racconterò le mie 
Bugie sul mondo e quelle 
Sulla gente 
Poi ti bacerò con tutto 
Quanto in fiamme 
Con le luci spente 
E faremo l'amore sulle 
Foglie e sui prati 
Sul denaro e nel fuoco 
Dentro ai posti proibiti 
Fino al cuore del mondo 
Come due innamorati 
Come due innamorati 
Senza niente da fare 
Che non hanno 
Nient'altro 
Che ""una storia d'amore"" 

Io ti curerò 
Perchè tu c'hai bisogno di ridere di gusto 
E ti ringrazierò 
Quando usciremo presto 
Da un locale ""giusto"" 
Guarderò da giù 
Il grattacielo dei tuoi tacchi mozzafiato 
E ti domanderai 
Se anche stavolta sono io quello sbagliato 
E faremo l'amore 
Dentro ad un temporale 
Tra le luci del centro 
Tra le statue di sale 
Con il cuore impazzito 
Come due innamorati 
Come due innamorati 
Senza niente da fare 
Che non hanno nient'altro

Nah, are you seeing someone else? Like, are you seeing someone else?
Am I seeing... How did we get from that to that?
That's how I feel, init, are you seeing someone else, because like, I don't even know anymore?
Babe- babe, how have we gone from that to that? You've rang me talking 'bout time,

Keeping us from being together
How long has it been since I've seen your smile
In this tunnel called the night
I can finally see a light
I've got a burning deep inside
I thought you might understand
I'm drivin' as fast as I can
And you said you'd wait for me

Goin' home
Going back to the place where my heart belongs
Goin' home
Going back where I left my family
Goin' home
And I hope that they're still waitin' there for me

In the eyes of the legal tender
You're the one who must surrender
I think they call it responsibility
I'm a man in emotion
With only one compulsion
I've got to follow these dreams inside my heart
I'm not looking for a fight
No one's wrong and no one's right
Maybe we all need time apart

Dann bin ich der nette Junge den eine Mutter gerne kennt 

Manchmal bin ich der gute Kerl dem man gerne auf die Schulter klopft

Aber meistens bin ich das Schwein

Öffne langsam die Augen, Helligkeit raubt die Sicht
Das Dröhnen im Schädel vergeht mit jedem neuen Zug
Erbrochenes mischt sich mit Alk doch noch nicht genug

An den besten Freund verloren und mit Ihr die Plagen

Wie das Salz in der Wunde, die niemals verheilt
Warum hab ich dir nie selber mal die Wahrheit gesagt
Zu viel falscher Stolz war alles was ich dir gab
Dass die Schuld auch bei mir lag ist mir schon klar
Doch ganz egal wo du bist, für mich bist du immer da

Sag warst du wirklich betroffen oder war es nur Schein
Ist es möglich, dass du weißt, wohin du wirklich gehörst
Und dass jeder andere zwischen dir und mir nur stört
Jetzt ist es wieder zu spät, die Chance wieder verpasst
Und die ungenutzte Zeit geht langsam über in Hass
Ich habe niemals gelogen und hab mir selber geschworen
Wenn meine Hoffnung verblasst, dann hab ich vor mir selbst verloren

Zu spät für uns zwei, für mich ist's Zeit zu gehen
Zu spät die Zeit ist überlebt, unsere Grenzen wollte ich nie sehen
Zu spät mit letzter Kraft mache ich mich auf meinen letzten Weg
Von mir fällt alles ab, ich kann das Leben, ich kann das Leben wieder sehen

Zu spät für mich wars allerhöchste Zeit
Zeit zu gehen um das letzte bisschen Stolz zu wahren

Und dann bist du gefallen, langsam in meinen Arm

Und der Regen spielt leise sein Lied, nur für mich.

Die schlinge um den Hals schon seit vielen Jahren
Und heute ziehe ich zu, ich komme denen 
Zuvor die schon lange drauf warten.

Dann war es endlich vollbracht: geteilte Liebe, geteiltes leid.

And so I face the final curtain

I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught

The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
'Til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

So what do you do
When somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing I will survive
Do you lash out and say how dare you leave this way?
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
'Til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

It'll break you down
Only if you let it
Everyday crazy situations rocking my mind
Tryin' to break me down
But I won't let it
Forget it (forget it)

I be feelin' like you bringing me down
Taking me around
Stressin' me out
I think i better go and get out
And let me release some stress (stress)

Don't ever wanna feel no pain (pain)
Hoping for the sun
But it looks like rain (rain, rain, rain)
Lord, I just wanna maintain

Yeah, I can feel pressures y'all
But never the less
Krayzie won't fall
It's over, it's ending here (here)

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove

Slug for the perfect picture
Chronic bud to save your struggles
So somebody suffer, scriptures
Time to rip ya, hit ya really good
I'll split ya, ditch ya
Gotta put ya in my hall of flames
And damn, it's shame
Listen up tight you can hear the storm, it's a hurricane
Bone, II Tru, Hustla'z, and Shifters (We are the soldiers!)
Bustas, no need to be runnin' from trues
Sucka, get murdered with skills
The ? to peel ya, straight up from infantry
Wars begin, we done sayin' they playin' to win
But we got it all within
So roll with the sheets, 'cause the thugs, they creep
Go and step on the ? with the midnight streets
Where they playin' for keeps, so fake soldiers...

[Mo! Hart]
Late hours of the eve
Now brothas out schemin'
Tryin' to break your heart
Gotta alleviate the problem before it even start
Sit relax and never losin' my composure
Brotha done told ya, better beware
'Cause this Mo Thug click got plenty of soldiers
Just open your eyes and realize
It's gonna be Mo Thug 'til I die
Never esitate don't flip
I can pin you all in them disguises
So if you want to come test
Definite action must proceed
But before it goes down
I gots to alert the rest of my family

[Jhaz]
why'all want no lovin' to a sister flowin'
Face me, you claim to be the sweetest
But the style I flex is crazy, never again no struggles
See Mo Thug, we on the rise everyday
I feel the swisha as my method of the high
No more want for money or place to eat or sleep
You see we family, now
Comin' up in game backdoor with the heat
Krayzie's friends out the walls
? by my lonely, before a sista was broke
Blow up Mo Thug open up more money...

[Souljah Boy:]
It be the Mo Thug, it's buck, quick bandages
One of these soldiers just can't stand 'em
Make me had to do a one-eighty-seven (one eighty-seven)
With a MAC-10, reactin' like you really want to know what's happenin'
Down with buckin' why'all with me strap and best a be duckin'
'Cause I'm blastin' real fast when I see fake-ass O.G.'s

[Ken Dawg]
I'm ridin' real; Mo Thug is where I be
I'm down with Ken
So put 'em up as I cock the pistols
Fin to dip home, get shot
Blown, who the next blown?

[Sin]
Tell me have you ever had this feelin'
Or a vision, that you played major part in a killin'?
The man that you murdered let's say for instance
That it's sickness and you did him
Pull the trigger bust the gun (are they evil)
The motive was death
You took his breath without a second guess
His chest was littered with blood
That pop unleashed, now fill the bag
Along with the shells from the slugs
And when they finally found him
All they got was the smell and the skull
Now further endanger the species
'Cause these niggas they plot
They rush up on the block with shots
From fully automatic weaponry
They had to be a least two or three cars deep
Then all of a sudden
One came up hatin' face to face with ?
Come around our way, you lay six feet
In a grave underneath in a coffin

[Tony Tone]
It's that Hustla with Hustla'z poetically known as Tony Tone
With them thugstas and Shifters, trues, and a playa
Let it be known that we're trues with weapons
Double I'm steppin', Mo Thug militant soldiers
Sucka better feel this bass
On the real, this fake
Don't needs this in this click
Now, you want to ride or die
Because there's hatred in your eyes?
I'd advise stay wise, better pray to God
'Cause these scriptures might
Just rip your mentals straight apart
It's from the heart
Demons that drop our lives got pinned inside
Realized they fell off
So many want to roll, but don't know how we stroll
They never know we're good go
So let's make our dough, for sure

But ain't no soldiers, this lunatic get the chrome
Now they get gone (on the dark
'cause the gat flipped) with them roll
And handlin' them demons makin' me crazy
Knowin' that Gates can't be fucked with
When I'm swangin' them thangs

Gotta load me clip when I rip
Then slip them slugs up out the chamber

Now what you gonna do when that won't get better, man?
You playin' within the game
That's why we done train and prayin' everyday
Family never divided
You heard it before, but this time you can buy
Some bustas fell off, we leave 'em behind
I'm mean we tried, but they could not fall in line
So this is what we've done, hell: eliminated haters, every one
Keepin' it real, makin' a mill
How do you feel? (I just want a mill, mill)

Takin' a journey deep on the darkside

Cause this is all real, what you see
I said it's all real it's just the thug in me

(verse 1)
Nigga just because Krayzie quiet speak less 
Don't be mistaking my kindness for weakness
Humble but ready to rumble 
My violent side I can't deny
I'm like a Jekyl and Hyde gemini
Look if you see me quiet 
then I'm plotting to riot why tell me why tell me why
I'm labeled a menace but I like it 
Destroy ya paranoia will make me blow you away but hey
Nigga got to close to me and that ain't how it's supposed to be 
Nigga want respect but what do you show me you 
Playa hate and anticipate the day that you can see me fall
Better act like yo know I'm rolling with Mo posse up
Do damage and manage to wiggle our way out of handcuffs
As we strut as thugs we must doin our best to obey god violent in these times
Got to do what you gotta do war till ninety-nine
Slim nigga gotta get up and go and get it if it's really coming
Now I got it and I'ma floor the niggas acting 
the safety's off come and get it if you really want it
(Hey, hey, hey) It's hating baby they gotta be so cold the gotta be heartless
In certain situations like retaliation

(chorus)

2x
Niggas be keeping it all real we keeping it all real with the real if it's 
real stay be real


We come with nothing but the real thing baby 
Krayzie got nothing but the real thing baby 
We come with nothing but the real thing baby
 Krayzie got nothin but the real thing the real thing

(verse 2)
Baby now this is the sound of me and my trues we put this down way down 
So now if you hear me releasing some shells
Hit the ground with the quickness lay better stay down on the darkside 
Take a look and you'll find true niggas like no other kind
Nigga say fuck the wine indo inside swisher sweet get me high

(2x)
Ain't nothin get to nothin somethin got to be real real somethin got to be 
real

(2x)
I still be thuggin in the khakis boots and skullies 
And since I'm weed fiend for the green nigga gotta make that money man
 
(8x)
It's real always

(verse 3)
Last night I P.O.D'd next to me Ouija, Ouija, 
and I fell in this fucked up state of mind
Slipped in the dream and I see demons telling me it's time to die
Why me I see some niggas they creeping outside my window
I'm ready to bang bang bang aim the 12 gauge pump let my lead go
Give it up for the bloody murda mo bloody murda mo mo
See a nigga when he go through the window had to put a bigger hole in his soul
If he get away running out my backdoor with me sawed-off swinging
Get ready to duck now to the guts buck pap pap pow

(2x) singing
I claim my thang to slang 
(murda mo murda mo murda mo murda mo murda mo murda mo)
Them bloody bodies kill 'em all send them hoes up in flames 
Krayzie insane to the brain 

(verse 4)
Now I know I done did some dirt in my time 
cause the devil was stressing my mind 
messing with my mind nigga
Bone don't know every day they lie 
Turn to realize that everyday I can do it if I only pray
Maintain cause a nigga was lusting
For money had to get it cause a nigga was struggling
I hit him with the Mossberg y'all heard about Mr. Sawed-Off 
Leatherface till them lay round after round after round
They'll fall down down
May they lay from the eruption man 
We putting them six feet deep we buck we bang

Weekend buzz, 'cause I'm still fucked up from the weekday

[Boogy Nikke]
I'm lovin' my weekend buzz
I smoke my swisha sweet with honey
Tony Tone, ge,t me a light to make a shit
Hit the light - did you pin the playa hation last night?
I'm gettin' stick it while I'm pinnin' all the sticky intentions
And the bitches and all them rag-to-riches-ass niggas
Take me back to the time when we was all in the back
And I jack that nigga for his swoll, twenty sack
Now what would ya do if a nigga had a blunt
And never smoked with you like you do?

[Tony Tone]
Just pass that blunt over to me
And let me hit that Henessey
Cause I'm still fucked up from last night
But a nigga like me got the sticky
I mean I gotta have mo' weed than little bit
I need that icky sticky shit before I have a weed fit
Cause drinkin' brews is nothin' new to me
P.O.D. and that's my speciality everyday and that's how life should be
All day long keep my head full of smoke
Until my lungs can't take no more
I guess I continue to choke, and smoke, and choke
I feel my weekend buzz, 'cause I'm still fucked up from the weekday

[Mo! Hart]
I'm sittin' on the side of my bed, just gettin' up
Nigga, these days I gotta wake up to a fat-ass blunt
Gettin' high is like a bare necessity
Just the feelin' that I get sometimes get the best of me
I'm already in my own world
But now it's enhanced by this green shit that I'm holdin' in hands
Spark up the flame, prepare for the countdown
'Cause, shit, I know damn well what's 'bout to go down
Smoke-session 'bout to go down
What? It's 'bout to go down

[Krayzie]
It's the last day of the week, finally Friday
And high we unwind, been handlin' millions
Collectin' chips, so now I want to get high tonight
Pockets tight, any tighter - they just might rip
When you get your money right, nigga
You smoke how much you like, and it's nice
Love marijuana, weed, la la, la la, whatever ya wants to call it
It's all good if it keeps me high
Here's another weed song, now sing along
Get your reefer on - Whoo!
Nigga, get ya reefer on
Remember ""Buddah Lovaz?""
One, after another
Yeah, now, how high can you go
'cause you know we can choke (choke)?
You know we can choke (choke, choke)
Yeah, ha ha, nigga
I said you know we can choke (choke, choke, choke, choke)

[Krayzie]
I can remember back in the day
if you bit another nigga
you was considered a biter
Non-originality, simply disrespectin' a true rider
Nigga, I'm fired up
Nigga, keep on bitin' the Bone
and your jaw'll get wired up
Keep on lovin' my song
but my nigga, you ain't Bone
Can you understand what's wrong?
Better get on
Sayin' you been flowin' since back in the day
Some of you was
Well okay, but whatever it was you were stressin'
It wasn't effecting nobody like this way
Hit me, so niggas can miss me with they drama
Tell them all like Willie-D told niggas
""Bitch, play with your mama. 'Cause I'm not your toy.""
So nigga don't test me, cause Krayzie ain't no sample
But really, could you handle
Big old slugs from these here magnum?
Ever since we came with Thuggish Ruggish Bone
Niggas been comin' up out the woods singin'
We stole they flow and song
If that's the case then why when we kick
Wicked shit, muthafuckas all like it?
And then why when you come tryin' to kick my shit
I can tell you strugglin' tryin'?
And back in the day how many niggas
Was really claimin' to be thugs?
Niggas was gangstas
So what the fuck done changed 'em? Huh?
What really be fuckin' my head up
Is when one nigga do somethin', come up
Make a Little bit of money, somebody all on your nuts
I'm keepin' it real, and bitch
If you Feel I'm talkin' bout you
Then it must be the guilt
I think we should give them the murder treatment
Yeah, that should learn 'em, baby

[Krayzie]
Oh, oh, we gonna kill them with the big shotgun
Yeah, fuck why'all niggas who's talkin', nigga
Niggas talkin' shit over here, nigga
Fuck why'all niggas wantin' to do it

Aw shit, these niggas done started over here
They talkin' shit, say we ain't rappin' (What?)
Niggas has got the nerve, and look who platinum
Niggas been runnin' off at the mouth
Before they think and look at the reality
I'm a speak on it, so bitch, be mad at me
Now first of all, why'all can't even talk
why'all need to go get your speech right
And then while you at it
You need quit samplin' that bullshit
And get your beats tight
Let's meet up at midnight in the alley
Where nobody knowin' what's happenin'
What's happenin?
You want to pull out some guns or do some rappin'?
A nigga don't want no problems
But then if he wants to cause it - a nine millimeter
Dawed-off, a .380, TEC-9, comin' out my closet
Probably only have to pull a muthafuckin' twenty-two
Probably just say ""Boo!""
And watch you niggas scuffle, scatter everywhere
Them niggas up outta there
That studio shit been known
To give niggas like you wig-splits
I hear you talkin', woofin' nigga
But I really can't feel shit
Now face it, nigga, rap just ain't the same
Especially since my Mo Thug family encountered the game
The fame is pain, for this I'll pay the price
And niggas tryin' to take my life
Always feelin' violent vibes
Just because I'm shinin' now
In the hood, it was sarcastic shit like
""You paid now, been awhile since you came around.""
So you tellin' me that I ain't down?
But first of all, when I was broke as fuck
You niggas did not give a fuck
Now all of the sudden
Ya lovin' me when we drunk, playa hata
We know who you are, can find out where you live
Better protect your kids
Fuck it, let's blow up his crib
10-o'clock news: ""Nobody lived.""

[Tombstone]
You better roll
Cause we give no love where we got to buck
Break you off somethin' proper with hate
I 'll break you off somethin' proper with love
It's all how you take it
We been never takin' no strippin'
For the body dippin'
Grips in the wasteland all from mad-testin'
Even though they know about death - a cold place to rest in

Double crossed by the law so theres nobody to run to

Outlaw, call him Leather Face

Heard they gotta couple banks in town that ain't been held up yet
Well uh, I oughta make it by sundown

Bow my head, askin' the Lord for change
Since I started sellin' 'cane
Shit ain't been the same
Began to acknowledge my bang ways
Who can I blame?
Maybe my pain, dealin' with it by callin' it a phase
These are the last days
Carry no shame, everyday thangs
Went from sellin' cocaine to rockin' the stage
The otherside of the game
Where you're rich, my aim to fame
Strange tradin' places, you're dealin' with races
Just wouldn't it be fate
Runnin' with thug, me never replace this
The Lord, I'd like to thank you for my Mo Thug family
Sincerely yours, Thug Queen (Thug Queen)

I remember my first day out of prison
Y'all, it was just me and my cousin
Takin' a ride in his car
We just went puffin' and sippin' on brews
Trippin' up old trues
Layzie asked me, ""What you gonna do? What you gonna do?""
I said, ""I don't know. I'm gonna take it slow
So gimme a couple of days, and I will let you know.""
I had to collect my mind
Knowin' one day I'm gonna shine
Until that day, I will pray
And try to parlay with the struggle God done dealt me
I know that He'll help me
Through the stormy weather
Our families got together and stay strong
But you gotta keep your head up high
'Cause there ain't no reason
Why you got to let it down
Just look around, we platinum bound (bound, bound)

And I want you to know (I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(It ain't easy, you know, you know ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(I won't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain
(I won't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain to the otherside of the game

Everything I ever knew since the day I was born
Consisted strictly of some type of a hustle
While my Mama workin' nine-to-five
On some nights, I be sittin' home alone
'Cause she'd be workin' doubles to survive
Makin' ends meet the best way she knew how
Keepin' food up on the table
Teachin' me the ways of the world - pick your friends
Like you do your fruit
Keep your distance from the playa hater
Pray you never have to shoot
I remember also on somedays there'd be nothin'
In our refrigerator except for a box of baking soda
And empty jar of pickle juice
I often wonder why the Lord
Had to create me in a world, oh so, so cruel
It's dog eat dog, I don't know what else to do
Except for call on God
Put my trust in You
No more, we're warriors.

I remember I went to school
With only about three pairs of pants, holes in my shoes
I guess I know what they mean by cold city blues
Ken bagged the stores
Tryin' to get money the best way I know how
How? Me and my brother up there
'Til hustlin' was no longer allowed
I know it's hard times
I'm learnin' this early to be a man
But since then, Ken Dawg flipped a whole new masterplan
Damn, don't nobody understand, but my family
But look at us now: the plan was to create jams
Ken Dawg, do or die, Mo Thug all the way to my dirt
I know it hurt the way we put in work
Can't do nothin', but ride with it, 'til it's over
From Novas to Range Rovers, we're still soldiers

You see a fellow like me
Done had it through all the wicked madness
Everyday I gotta fight this demon
Sadness take over my world of gladness
Then they want to ask me,
""Why do we all stay so high, fiendin'?""
Come kick it the way we roll
That's if you can handle it, baby
Without you tryin' to hate me, never
No more, so fuck 'em, look at this hate
Now stroll and get on my hustle
To keep my pockets swoll for sure
I collect more of those
Still we prefer takin' bills that fold
To hoes, me and my trues decided
To plot you for your dues
Come through with the battle
Ran through your house
And robbed the people next door
Moved out neighborhood
Now, who would you blame it on?
The ghetto?
Why this old crooked system set up to mess us up
But we come up and never fade the soldiers' ghetto

And I want you to know (ooh, I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks (just ask my folks)
And I won't blame it on the rain
(We can't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain (oh, no, yeah)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game.

Stormy weather tossin' my boat to and fro
Often to the point of shatterin' senses
I don't know which way to go
Somethin' inside persistin' me to move on
Just maintain, hold on, but my son, just keep it strong
Everything gon' be alright
Keep you're head to the sky
Just as long as you keep it real
And strive to reach the golden prize
Did what I had to do to make it this far
A lot of people got stuck
And I took enough battle scars
Took refuge worldwide to replenish my thought
I was not ready to accept them devilish clout
Drop to my knees, and began to do nothin' but pray
Gradually, life began to change
I'm in this Mo Thug game
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim

Would you forgive me, Lord
If I killed that man - that man
That tried to run up and rob me blindly
And leave me for dead was his intent?
But, Lord, I may be like that on the outside
Inside I'm one that's searchin' for peace
Right, as we ride deep
And seek holy scriptures, believe
Rollin', nobody knows what it is or who we approachin'
Just strollin', trustin' in the Lord (in the Lord)
As we struggle to make it each day, baby
You can believe that they keep gettin' harder with the time
With haters and evil
And sometimes it's even my people
And it feel like I'm losin' my mind
Fire, you need to burn this entire evil, evil empire

And I want you to know (to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(Through the rain, through the clouds
Through the thunderbolts)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(And we can't blame it on the rain, no)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain
(We can make it through the pain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game",Otherside/Otherside (Outro),1998

To stay fucked up mentally stuck
Feelin' I'm a little nigga with no nuts
Just for a double up, helpin' the devil
Turn this soldier's soul to dust
Who can I trust when I'm just livin' for lust?

On the block losin' focus
In the front of the church, sellin' dope
Feelin' hopeless, copeless, 'cause I'm homeless
Shit, I gotta serve to eat

Stay intoxicated so my problem don't overweigh me

Basically, helpin' my enemies
Destroy me and my self-esteem

Straight to the parkin, lift them nigga what 

We all thugged out, got on khakis, fatigues and boots 

Just watchin all the loud talkers floss they cheese and jewels 

Clean diamond rings and suits, we ain't hatin nigga we hungry 

And we'll rob your ass with the quickness if you show me the money 

Call it whatever my nigga but I call it being a thug and a hustler 

And you gotta have the nuts to be both 

And I gotta roll with the raws 

And get with the steady regardless 

Fuck, how much your bitch and how many niggas you with 

See we the ones that like to crash the party 

Drink all the forties up and disrespect every nigga in there 

'cause we don't give a fuck (we don't) 

Just 'cause I be rappin and all my records went platinum 

Don't exactly mean I had to get rid of my Thug Mentality 

But I know some niggas be fakin themselves 

That's 'cause they hoes 

And when they get caught up in confrontations they be scared as hell 

Ain't nothin wrong with bein a thug, but y'all got to keep it real 

So don't you get your ass on wax tellin lies about how you live 

Now I dedicate this to my real strugglers 

Make em feel ya, fuck makin em love ya 

And y'all gon learn, them thugs and hustlers

Steady breakin' me on down, break break down
Steady breakin' me on down
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down

You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me
But that you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended
To be feeling similarly
And led you to believe it was okay
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath a disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
'Til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

So what do you do
When somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing I will survive
Do you lash out and say how dare you leave this way?
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you

The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
'Til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

It'll break you down
Only if you let it
Everyday crazy situations rocking my mind
Tryin' to break me down
But I won't let it
Forget it (forget it)

I be feelin' like you bringing me down
Taking me around
Stressin' me out
I think i better go and get out
And let me release some stress (stress)

Don't ever wanna feel no pain (pain)
Hoping for the sun
But it looks like rain (rain, rain, rain)
Lord, I just wanna maintain

Yeah, I can feel pressures y'all
But never the less
Krayzie won't fall
It's over, it's ending here (here)

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove

Whatcha gon' do, whatcha gon' do
When they come for you, come for you, what?

[TQ:] No, ain't nowhere to run
And no, ain't nowhere to hide
When the heat is on, ain't nothin' you can do
But close your eyes and ride, and hope you get away

[TQ:] (No) People always talk about my lifestyle
Tell me nothin' good could come of it
But I always used to figure it was worth my while
That's why I had to hit this lick
11:30, a 6-4, ridin' dirty
I got the goods, but I think they heard me
Lord help me, can I get away?
Stashing stuff away
'cause the boys are comin' to get me
All my people say...

[TQ:] No, ain't nowhere to run

When the heat is on, ain't nothin' you can do
But close your eyes and ride, and hope you get away

[Krayzie:] Now tell me whatcha gonna do (buck buck)
When they come for you
When the murderers hit the curve, and suddenly red rum
I gotta respect, refuse to be the dead one
Will it be this bustin' ass ?, got on vests but we duck, gotta protect our head
It ain't no tellin' when niggas start actin' stupid
'Til they roll up on your block, wit glocks, scheme ass could start shootin'
You want to know what I'm doin'
Keepin' a weapon at all times
'cause shit, the broke niggas ain't got, they runnin' up lookin' around
And I think they really want it
But who want to come to get it
want to pay that unexpected visit to my crib for the riches
I tell 'em to bring it on
A nigga done worked to hard for this shit
Plus I'm a man and a captain goin' down with his ship
Let's do this, AK 47 spittin' it
When the situation get heated, we gon' be there
With the proper tools and equipment, never be slippin'
Ask me what I'm gon' do when the mob get to jumpin'
And gotta fight 'til it's over
If I don't make it, then I'll go down like a soldier
 
[TQ:] Let me hear you say...
[Chorus]
[TQ:] No, ain't nowhere to run
And no, ain't nowhere to hide
When the heat is on, ain't nothin' you can do

No, ain't nowhere to run
And no, ain't nowhere to hide
When the heat is on, ain't nothin' you can do
But close your eyes and ride, and hope you get away

[TQ:] What you gonna do when they come for you?
Even if they catch me homie, I gotta say somethin'
I won't live another day, and have nothin'
Just believe that I'll be back around in a year or two
Catch me if you can baby
I got a plan baby
Got to get away
Let me hear you say...

Krayzie Bone,"You look in my eyes
And I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy
But you still can touch my heart
And after all this time
You'd think that I
Wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

Each day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I
I'm not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope
Left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance

No, no, no, no, no, no I need you baby
I still believe that we can be together, no no
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again.

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
You and me
Will find ourselves in love again

So let the games begin

Yakity yak, don't jump back or it's on
Callin' up Earl on the car phone
Mack 10 just got out of court rollin'
Through the hood in his super sport ropin' Too Short

Eighteens got the rear view mirrors vibratin'
And deep dish day tons, you know how we do it
Ain't nuttin' to it but the floss
Overcrowdin' Harrison walks

'Cause if ya fuck wit ours, we leave scars
Out of G ride cars, livin' like stars
Might hit tha highway
On the Vegas run fool 'cause it's Friday

Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in the air
If ya don't care
Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in the air
If ya don't care

Standin' outside on a Friday livin' on the edge
'Cause we all got 'dem hard heads
It's seems like we all are waitin'
For a drive by playin' tag wit Satan

But we chillin' yeah, we ready and willin'
Ya hear about the latest west side killin'
Forty sippin', set trippin', fo' dippin'
Get the grip in, neva slippin'

BG's tryin' to hang out
But OG said, ?Take ya little ass in the house?
My big homey just got out
Used to be down now he's just crack ad

He's bout hard as Darth Vada
In his sweat shirt, khakis and Chuck Taylors
Just see him in the drive way
Gettin' beat like a smoka fool 'cause it's Friday

Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in the air
If ya don't care
Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in the air
If ya don't care

Why must I be like dat and chase da cat
Or settle for a hood rat
Dukie braids no dreadlocks
Flyin' in and out of jail have a chicken and a cock

And I love her 'cause she down
To fuck around wit the underground pussy hound
And her ass is big round and wide
Jacked up makin' nigga down the ride

Smokin' indo, playin' dat Super Nintendo
Hear a rat, ?Tat, tat?, on my window
Gave her ass dat pelvic thrust
Don't trust the rubber 'cause its bound the bust

In the oven, in the nappy
I had on two so I was happy
'Cause dat HIV'll make ya dick hang sideways
And dat ain't cool fool 'cause its Friday

Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in the air
If ya don't care
Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in the air
If ya don't care

Throw the west side in da air
Throw the east side in da air
Throw the south side in da air
Throw the north side in da air
Oh, yeah

Even though the streets are bumpy, lights burned out
Dope fiends die with a pipe in their mouths
Old school buddies not doing it right
Every day it's the same
And it's the same every night
I wouldn't shoot you bro but I'd shoot that fool
If he played me close and tried to test my cool
Every day I wondered just how I'll die
Only thing I know is how to survive
There's only one rule in the real world
And that's to take care of you, only you and yours
Keep dealing with the hard times day after day
Might deal me some dope but then crime don't pay

Cause to me, life is one hard rap
Even though my sister smoked crack cocaine
She was nine months pregnant, ain't nothing changed
600 million on a football team
And her baby dies just like a dope fiend
The story I tell is so incomplete
Five kids in the house and no food to eat
Don't look at me and don't ask me why
Mama's next door getting high
Even though she's got five mouths to feed
She's rather spend her money on a H-I-T
I always tell the truth about things like this
I wonder if the mayor overlooked that list
Instead of adding to the task force send some help
Waiting on him I'd better help myself

Even though they put us down and call us animals
We make real big banks and buy brand new clothes
Drive fancy cars, make love to stars
Never really saying just who we are
We use alias names like Too $hort
Sell your stuff you might kill for
Young kids grow up and that's all they know
Didn't teach him in school now he's slangin' dope
Only thing he knows is how to survive
But will he kill another brother before he dies?
In the ghetto, you keep one eye open
All day long, just hoping and hoping
You can pay your bills and not drink too much
Then the problems of life you'll be throwing up
Like me, but you don't see
Ten years from now, where will you be?

Never be ashamed of what you are
Proud to be black stand tall at heart
Even though some people give you no respect
Be intelligent, when you put em in check
Cause when you're ignorant, you get treated that way
And when they throw you in jail you got nothing to say
So if you don't listen it's not my fault

Krayzie Bone,"The drama just goes on and on
Drama be just part of my life
It's been like that since I was born
Yes I can run but I can't hide
Gonna be like that until I'm gone
Drama always seems to find me, find me, find me

Roll down my family tree with me
Give it up page to page
We never no stuggles
I never knew no hustlers like my
Daddy and Mamma so I
Gotta drop my P's
But I think way back in the day now
When moms and pops had my back
They stayed down
And gave us a place to lay down
But then
Then when the wind blew in
(?) the crackpot
But lately it's keeping my people up off the hinges
Can I get a witness baby
And I'm off the dope
Cause I'm gonna make me some money my own
Somebody tell me now where we went wrong
I'll bring my family back because they long gone
Now pops don't even come around
But I know pops got problems
that's why your little niggas still down
With cha
But it hurts to see a family taking a beating
My sisters keep saying they hungry [hungry]
Got to come up on some way to feed em
Big (?) take a ride slide down 71 callin welfare
When the cheque come mom she hound everyone
So bang bang
Gotta get down for my thang
Swang with a my thugsters
Pump, we never did love ya
St. Claire struggler
Here your hustla baby

Chorus 2 times

I can't get away from all these dramas surrounding me
Hounding me
Heavily coming down on me
Drama be pounding my brain
Calling my name
These demons they seem to be following me
Come in all shapes and sizes
Enemies my friends it don't surprise me
I try to help niggas make better
But they ain't appreciate
niggas they rather stay back in the ghetto
Well oh well
If that's how you want it nigga
Then go ahead
But don't fuck with me
I'm up in this bitch like Micahel Jackson
I wish they'de leave me alone
Before I show the other side of me
Bang bang bang bang bang
that's how it be
Nigga gonna get violent
But if my so-called ex friends want to try me
Bloody riot 
that's how we like it
You all invited
Get so heated you feel the temperature rising
So heated we spit black flames
4-page article
On the police
Couldn't find that them bitches was particles
For fucking with me
And I'm down to stand on the frontline and get wild
One of the first to get up and get down
Niggas ain't knowin' the anger inside me
And then when I finally snap nigga out
Fuck up your sister your daddy your momma your brother
If you he some drama
c'mon  c'mon  c'mon.

Krayzie Bone,"Chorus:

They call me the ""Dummy Man"" (man, man, man)
And I'm up early tryina slang my dope 
(I'm the nigga with the biggest rocks)
The fiends...they get awfully mad....(mad, mad, mad)
When they go broke on dope and it's really soap 
(My nigga you ain't never lied)

Verse 1:

Up in the morning....and I feel like I don't want to be livin'
Better off dead without no bread....have you ever felt that feeling?
Unsatisfied, feelin' like you want to die
When you reach into your pocket and can't even find
Not even enough to go purchase a dime (sack of weed)
But FUCK THAT!  I got ""come up"" in my blood
Cause it's the ""1st of the Month"" (nigga what!)
The perfect time to come up
The only problem is: I'm broke and ain't got no dope
But as I was standin' in my bathroom mirror....I looked at the soap
Shit...soap look a little like dope (you scandalous nigga!)
Then, I chopped-chopped up me some counterfeit amphetamines
But wait a minute.....
Wait a minute now...what if they want to taste it?
Think quickly for cash: nigga dash to the kitchen, get the bread bag
Wrap that bread around some soap
Now I got the breadcrumb-dumb-dumb dope
It might sound funny, but it ain't no joke...
cause doin this shit could get a nigga smoked, mayn
But FUCK IT! Young nigga gotta get them duckets
Hit the medicine cabinet for the final touches...
Orajel for the numbness
Then I hit the corner with a handful of breadcrumbs...
nigga got the dumb-dumb for ya
And the pump on approach if you say it ain't dope, 
only dealin cause I hate to be sober
Peep, ""creep on ah come up"", I wait for a fiend to roll up
And walk to the car with my hand on my pistol, 
he showed me the green, said 
""Hold  up...gotta get my stash""
Nigga need a 20...but I got that faded
Lovin these yum-yums, glad I made it; 
I just hope this nigga don't try to taste it!
I dropped him the dummy, he said it was lovely
But as he pulled off, I pinned that he put the rock up in his mouth
(So he gon' come back for his money!)
I pinned that he braked...he skid...
Put it in reverse and he came back quick...
Fiend jumped out and he talkin' all big...
This is what happened to this bit....
We beat him and finished him off, and he never came 'round here no more
Cause a nigga ran into yours truly: poor, and a nigga scored
Lord forgive me but i can't remember (the last time I ate)
Now I gots to go get me a plate, or a bit, now I'm proper
Only spent three dollars and forty-four cents, 
nigga full, now I gotta get bent
Nigga still got sixteen dollars and fifty-six cents...HELL YEAH!
These dumb-dums got a nigga off the hook..they got booked, took, shook
Look: got dope but it ain't dope, so I guess you can call me a ""crooked crook""
Hey...do you know somebody like me?
I don't think so, cause ain't nobody I see
Down for the crime like I'm down for mine, 
and if I gotta, nigga I cheat 
(cheat)

Chorus (x2)

So fuck with me, I got the chops mayn (chops mayn)

could even reply some nigga jumped right

Feelin' hot bullets fly over my head/ Thinkin' for sure that I'm gonna be dead/ 
Scared? Oh yeah! So I turned around and ran out

Krayzie Bone,"Shit
I've been a thug my whole motherfucking life
Struggling, doing what the fuck I've got to do to survive
Bottom line, thugline

You see me on TV but you don't really know me
Don't know the story of the warrior and how I survived in this game
Nigga never had shit
Had to work to get it or I had to steal it

Most of the time I was hungry, that's why I did it
I ain't bullshittin', seventeen
I'm leavin' the house, I need my own
Nigga done tried to be grown and fucked around

Now I'm homeless on the streets
With my niggas I learned about every drug
The heroine, the weed, the speed, the crack, the sherm
But we was broke and we couldn't afford it

But niggas was schemin' and plottin' on shit
Oh yes, you know this, I come from a long line of thugs
Us strugglers hustle what we can rustle up
It might not have been too much

But we always got just enough, our hard times
Kept niggas together through all the windy weather
And nigga whenever you need somebody to roll
I'm goin' to be there, you know me

A nigga stayed thug devoted in the streets
When I didn't have a place to sleep or shit to eat
My family goin through some pains
They struggle but they make out

My people off their hinges and it was against our religion as a witness
So you know I really can't comprehend it
My mother and father told me
""Don't mess with drugs and why you smokin'?""

I was right or wrong? Can't understand it
If the purpose was to have a nigga struggle
I don't think they should have had me, had me
Think they never should of had me
As I drop to my knees, can't you see I ain't happy?

I hope it won't be long, I hope it won't be long
Before I end this song, I wanna end this song
I hope it won't be long, it won't be long

They bitches.
I put another clip in,
Unload some more,
Keep spittin'.
I never can understand:
If security's got the door,
Then why so many niggas in here got guns?
And I can testify that 'cause I just shot one.

Formulate a different tactic, let's sing anthems
No sterotypical categorizing, rising above all make shift realities
Fantasies misconstrued the thoughts of wicked men
They cough as lungs inhale, exhale poisonous gases
Oh well, I guess I'll just protect myself in good help
Done played out the wickedest hand man has ever dealt
I felt like dying just the other day 'cause Satan was trying
Walking too close by my side
Stay still, please don't move your soul you could lose
No crying, where's my blood?
You'll find out soon enough
Alright I'll ride, in due time we'll get our chance to die
Hold on to my mind
No use for guns or drugs, need mo' love
But yet and still, slugs get fired off constantly
Immorally, destroying my holy oracle
But I just ignore it though
Keep a steady pace just movin slow...slow, just movin slow

I begin to hear noises comin from the other room
So I pause my Nintendo, then I walk over to the window
Is it paranoia from the indo?
Then goes a thought, then another thought
Run and get the pump, 'who goes there?
What the fuck you want?'

You on my grounds
Hope they got enough of the rounds
All of a sudden I heard a crash
My first instinct was to blast, but the Mauseburg didn't last
So I had to dash, ran upstairs I was franic in panic
But I managed to make it to the top, to my artillery shop
I was runnin, but I could hear the souljah's comin
I don't they must think I have some money
AK-47 and a Mack-11
Jettin to the bedroom locked myself in, the clip is in
Teach 'em a lesson it ain't healthy to rob
They fit to slip on the job, soon as they twist on the knob
Just like I figured when they twisted it, the AK-47 was hot
I had to drop it but I emptied it
The Mack-11 would hit, hit the niggaz up from head to toe
Had to escape and I was out the window
Here I do, I hit the ground, uhh
Then I looked around, shook the fall
Hopped in the Benz and hauled
Callin my niggaz let's get ready for war
I think I killed 'em all but I know that they'll be sendin some more
So when they come back around, I say we show 'em rappin don't mean a thang
And this is a gun, and this is a grave

Off with his head oh well
You know they don't give a damn if that make the weak mind feel the same
It's a shame how they watch you, stalk you
Pinnin every step I make, Knowin every breath I take
Makin it easy for the next man to get his hands on a .38

(Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?)
Keepin it real on the street
N****s they practice what they preach, stayin true until they D-I-E
N****s still strong
We keep on bailin through the stress
and all the rest of the s*** that's goin on
Speakin of violence, I see, you got to keep a pistol
Cause if n****s think you're rich, you gon be got, they out to pinch ya 
Bulls*** you not--killin' because of the pump
And it drives us to the point of no return
Especially when you're gone off of the sherm
You could give a f*** about a n**** flossin
While you walkin, he on sixteen switches
Ain't that a b****? But that's life
This s*** ain't nothin' nice, and he'll take yours if his ain't right
And I can't stop 'em or knock 'em, but yo, I wouldn't even try, though
Cause Bible say, ""Hey, either repent or you will die""
So (so, so), choose one (just one)
Either repent and get saved
Or put some food on your table for now

(Chorus)x2
Street people
(People)
All my people be them n****s with an attitude
(We're ready for war)
The street mentality
It's do what you gotta do
(Do what you gotta do)

Krayzie & (Niko)
I see my sisters out there hustlin, man (strugglin, man)
Do what it takes, but that's the brakes, rustle up what you can
Gotta feed your babies (babies, yeah)
Handle yourself your own business
don't wait on that n**** to get you nothin
We been poor long enough, and I know you would scheme on somethin
(somethin, yeah) Take the welfare, f*** it!
The system givin it to you, cause it's guilt on they conscience
Don't let 'em fool you (don't let 'em fool you, no)
Really ain't doin' a n**** any favors
So come and get the paper, paper, before you die, die
This verse is for my ghetto queens
Tryin' to come up and get them better things
particularly cheddar cheese
Make that money (make that money)
Work, work, work
Whatever your occupation
As long as you bringin home the bacon, bacon, bacon
Don't let your enemy lock your mind, too
And I hope why'all really been payin attention cause it's 1999, ohh
(Ooh-ooh, yeah)
Though people comin around, we gon' thug
So where the thugs at?
Gimme some of that ghetto love (ghetto love) 

(Chorus)x2
Krayzie & (Niko)
Now if why'all feelin me
let's get down and tear the roof off the mother
Shoot the mmotherf***ers, I'm serious and mean business
Ready to pump pump and ride, you with it?
Come on, put it out there, pump, pump, pump police
They treat us like animals - let's attack 'em like beasts
But hold on 'fore you start fightin (hold on, hold on)
Let's brighten up the action scene, pa** me the gasoline
(no more, no more) I'm really not trippin on this rappin no more
Cause I know it won't last too much longer
When it's over, then I be a full-time soldier (I told you)
If I make it out of the game with all my sanity
Get paid, f*** the fame, get out quickly, understand me?
Cause at the rate I'm goin, pretty soon they'll try to ban me
for killin these muthaf***as tryin to tamper with my family
Now they got me runnin' from these po-po's tryin to jam me
But I told them muthaf***as not to try to test my manly
And this is my mentality for f***in with the street life, street life
(street life)

(Chorus)x2
(Niko)
I gotta give it up to all my thugstas, we're street people
Them n****s with an attitude
Let's stop the killin, we're strugglin just like you to make a livin
We're not pretendin, don't why'all remember?
It ain't easy tryin to stay alive, some people out there smokin crack
My people workin 9 to 5, just doin' it right
Real strong
Hold on
cause it won't be long before the strugglin' days is long gone
Hold on, be strong

Come follow me now
Back in the day we still was thuggin
Nothin changed
Always into somethin
Whatever you name
A young thug with my niggas it's one love
Little bad ass niggas sneaky
A calm collected slickster
I might not have been on the scene
But you could believe I was in the picture
In the mixture selling llello
Scrapping, car jackin, gun packin
I'm lacking everything you can't imagine so I'm praying
Rapping can get me up out this jam
Damn, just gimme a chance
I'll keep 'em dancin, dancin, all night, all night
But times got harder and harder
My dreams got further and further away
And nigga I chased them but couldn't catch them to save my life
So now I'm thugging on this corner
I gotta increase my financial status
I chance it fucking with these rollers when they roll up
Yeah don't want to be locked in no cell
But I also can't take strippin's and be broke with no mail
Ohh yes, it's hell
And they say that gets easier
But to me it only got deeper and deeper

Chorus
 
Just turned eighteen and caught my first case
Incarcerated, caught with a twelve gauge
Trying to come up with some money and made a stupid-ass mistake
Could have been my niggas fate
Fucking with shotguns
We out to rob some niggas I'm drunk, I'm pumped
I made a mistake and popped him, now he bleeding
I see blood, damn, get to the doctor, Nigga don't rest in peace
Doctor's took him to emergency
Copper's came and arrested me
Not knowing if my nigga had made it alive and was well
I tossed and turned in my cell knowing he's sweatin like hell
Praise to the Lord and I hope you hear me
And I hope you feel me
I ain't mean to, really, really, I ain't mean it
I know you seen it
I finally spoke to my nigga
He lifted up and recovered
And pressed no charges
Wait the state done picked it up and I gotta trial in a month
Fuck!
And the judge ain't trying to give me no love
Cause it was my first offence
But he just thinkin he lockin up a thug
So now I'm cuffed up on the bus
And ridin' down 71, ain't no fun 

Chorus

Now I'm locked inside this prison system
Biddin and count days left before my sentence
Now I can say that I've been here
But I sure ain't gonna come back here
Uh-uh!
The day they release me I'm going home
I can cope but I can't adjust
These fucking steel doors drivin me nuts
My last month and I'm ready to move out
I'm sure, stay on the low
I listen to thug stories 
And be trippin on niggas love stories
I'm finna get out of this motherfucker
Heard them call out my name
Two fifty two two fifty
Pack up your shit it's your day
Jumped out my bunk, gave all my shit to my niggas
In fact I left everything that I had back in jail but my raps
I'm on the streets now
Scene unchanged
Niggas still the same
I ain't fuckin with you bustas cause I'm tryin to make a change
I got with the real dogs and we was schemin on the mill' ya'll
So we had to chill on ya'll
Get out of Cleveland if we plan to achieve it
So we plannin it with Eazy on Greyhound and now we're leavin

Nigga these days we killing much quicker to get us some paper, ya feeling me?
These days you got to be packing a gun everybody your enemy
These days it's every nigga for they self
Cause it ain't no such thing as friends
And well, so nice niggaz get left
And that's cause these days you got to be raw out here on the streets
Tell 'em these days you can't be fucking with niggaz that's weak
And these days no telling when you'll meet your coffin
I seen it too often that's why fuck flossing; I take caution
Don't trip, shit if your rich your rich
Cause if you slip somebody waiting to get
At you grab ya cash and split ya shit
These days stay in the low low and away from po-po
Unless you ready to pull your fo' fo' and blow (OH!)
How come these days niggaz want to be the don of the mob?
They claim it but they never qualify for the job
These days we busting at motherfuckers quicker
Simply 'cause its 1999 nigga (nigga nigga nigga)

[Chorus]

[K-Mont]
Ay yo I'm straight out of the bricks and y'all ain't worthy to serve me
I'm the type that jump out your bushes and bust you with a 30, 30
You want beef? I pack pistol packing utilities
I'm the type of nigga that'll send letter bombs to all my enemies
I can't even walk the airport for being who I was
Police all on my dick because they recognize a thug
Nigga we trying to get money, we don't respect the police
Until us thugs unite it ain't gon' never be no peace
Niggaz be going to school with nothing but murder on they minds
Giving a fuck about teachers busting shot guns and nines
Picture the scenes and screams and everybody running
Get on your knees and pray nigga cause the son of the lord is coming

[Asu]
You know what came in time that's my frame of mind
Now I'm able to separate the deaf from the weak, dumb and the blind
Niggaz can't get none of mine, not even some of mine
Just cause you got on a watch nigga don't mean you know the time
You stagnating, you fags hating my motion
From ocean to ocean my magic potion is devotion
The nerve to hate what I deserve to do wasn't a curse it was a signal
That's why that ass crashed for got to put on your blinker
R-W-I: rolling while infatuated
I graduated, now I want my master
Y'all done agitated disaster
And at every ends I start I slip in the art with my heart and soul
And start to roll but dumb to come
Don't become the one I fold like the lawn chair
You shouldn't have gone there
What's the deal with the long stares?
What's the purpose? Jokers on earth surface to surface
And any problem is handled the same day as service (what what what what)

[Chorus]

[Bam]
We run the blocks stop the clocks turning rocks and dice
Set trip it's our spot gave y'all shots and let the drama pop
Don't escalate the 4-5-9 just try me dead or alive
Point of survival let's get points with real niggaz lives
But you only see raw meat on streets; these niggaz love their heat
Nowadays all busters want to thug like me you see it be
Wasn't way so simple execution style pull the gristle
From the chair heard 'em whistle for my nigga mental
It's money, murder, riding dumping heads back to all of y'all
Since every nigga's all hard and proving they got the bigger balls
Scared of the laws told what he saw and what it looked like
Broke him off in the midnight I spared his life I said this shit is tight

I'm down to ride on these imposters, fake playa, gangsta thugs
And these hoes who claim they mobsters, 'cause they cloggin' up the game
Muthafuckas is rappin', sayin' anything
And tryin' to claim everythang to get they pockets paid
I'm tellin' 'em, that's the wrong way!
Can't say you thug and then be fake
Nigga, that's the point I'm tryin' state in this case
But niggas ain't feelin' me, though
So yo, I say we weed em' out and heat em' up
Heard you woofin' yeah we heard em', let us see them nuts
And then if he really jump, more power to ya
But no matter how it go, nigga we still 
gon' be bringin' it thug style to ya, buckin'
Boo-yah!
Checkin' these bustas do be kind of fun
Because they know when it's static
We gon' handle it however it come
And nigga whoever it's from sure ain't givin' a fuck who you roll with
If they human, then they ain't shit we can't control
And if they bleed, and they need oxygen to breathe nigga ya die
Never fear no man
No matter the size the bigger, the harder they fall
Got somethin' for all of y'all, especially ???
Tech'll chop him up, now he ain't half the man he thought he was
I bet these niggas think they rappin' so they actin'
So we come for a little target practice aimed exactly at ya, exactly at ya

(Chorus)

(Krayzie)
Roll through my city I see niggas watchin'
Probably plottin', schemin' to rob me, take all the money
And dump my bloody body
I'm sorry not me
I stay alarmed and be alert
Whether you're goin' to play or work
Make sure you got you pistol first, be ready to burst
Hesitation could bring up a fucked up situation 
like you leavin' in the body bag
Zipped up, slip up that body tag
So if you spot him, blast
Better him than you, huh?
I'm tellin' you now that me and my thugs
Can bring you anything that you want right out of the trunk
So, what's the bullshit?
We got some shit you can't fuck with
And nigga that be this muthafuckin' thug shit
We love this, probably gon' die because of it
Fuck it! I ain't worried about dyin' right now
My money's what's important
Hey we livin' to die anyway no matter if it's now or later
You gon' rest in peace it don't get no greater
Kill 'em all, and when it's time to drop the mic and go pick up a rifle
Time to fight for what we right for
See who really like war, yeah
I bet you most niggas lose as soon as they get in it
I can't afford to roll with bustas 'cause I'm really tryin' win it
(I'm really tryin' to win it)
We fightin' to be victorious (victorious)
Witness the story of (the story of) 
this silent, mighty, mighty, warrior (warrior)
If you hear any nigga move shoot
Don't let the nigga layin' dead be you
So soldier, pick up you boots and move
Runnin' for cover 'cause if they buck ya it's over
Just like I told ya, you can die
Soldier, you can die, soldier

Shit, man, I can't believe this shit, man
Them motherfuckers done killed him
We got to ride for this nigga
On them old hoe ass niggas
I say we ride over right there, right now
That's what I'm talking about, let's roll

As we delve through the mud and rain
Straight shots of tongue ease the pain
As we put to rest one of my niggas
That got cut up and lost half his brain
Shit, ain't the same niggas is dangerous
Buckin' like it's the thang to bust
When I looked at my nigga fucked up
I couldn't help thinking this could've been aimed for us

Niggas do hate like that, nigga, you never know
He say a friend but I smell foe
So I sit back and wait for the day niggas try to kick in my door
So I sleep with the big fo-fo
But what if I fuck up and pull it too slow
You know what they say, gotta go, gotta go
What if I be the one breathing no more, oh well
When I die I want all my motherfuckers to ride
(For me)

On the niggas that did me killed, me committed my homicide
Gather up after the funeral and pull out all the big guns
(Posse up)
Go through every hood poppin' till somebody tell you somethin'
How in the fuck can I rest in peace when I wasn't ready to die
So I'm begging my niggas to get my revenge
And do it the same night they put me under
Now I'm gone but this thug shit gone live on
Just write on my tombstone he was that thuggish ruggish bone

Murda mo, niggas, gone kill some more

When I die I wanna see about a hundred niggas cryin'
Lying, talkin' 'bout they all love Ryan
And Joey too, you should've seen me at the funeral
Sporting the top hat tuxedo was royal blue murder who
Nigger, I died in the car chase shot
The place like the last scene in Scarface
Now I'm in the far place chillin' in the whites of the sky
Terror Squad till the day I die

I'ma thug, I'ma die high O.D. off the la-la
Niggas tell me get off that weed, I'ma keep smoking on that thai
Nigga, fuck that, I'ma keep hittin' that

Till my lung collapse, what's wrong with that?
You hypocrite, just a little bit you know you down with it

It's all good in your hood having laughs
Puff weed to clear my cataracts
Never thought I'd see the inside of an ambulance
But now I'm there too many dead brain cells
Runnin' 'round inside my head
That's when I died my eyes were blood shot red

Now picture me dead, still getting head in the coffin flossin'
Bitches fightin', cryin', tryin' to get a bigger portion
My niggas talkin', figuring how to get my fortune
While I'm lost in space waiting for Satan and his horseman
Walkin' through fire sparkin' my lighter cloud the sky up
Rising higher and higher, eye to eye with my messiah
Viya Con Dios as I cross the gates of hell
I faced the devil with a shovel and told him brace yourself

Reporters steady ask why KB be talkin' 'bout murder on all the songs
I say 'cause I could step out the door, somebody could pop and I'm gone
Then they wanna know why I pack chrome for one I'm paranoid
Smoking too much of that weed, what's that I just heard a noise
Get the 12 gauge and I call my boys
Motherfuckers is plottin' to get me, I know when I'm dreaming this
So that's the meaning of this

Nine millimeter heater strapped with infrared beams and shit
So nigga don't trip the reaper, seem to be getting closer
So I'm running from that motherfucker swervin' and duckin' murder
Pistol grip pump protected by the gauge
Mr Sawed-Off Leatherface reload the clip and into the crowd I spray
Murder murder, mo murder, murder, kill, kill, kill

Shit, it's selling but what they ain't telling niggas is that it's real
But you better realize for it be you in the casket dropped
Better get you ass a shotgun and go get a plastic glock
Nigga, don't take murder for no joke, that's like slittin' your own throat
But I tell you what'll help for sure is if you bust back at them hoes

Buck buck fuck where my thugs at, where the fuck my thugs at
Are you ready for war, got to be ready for war

(verse 1)
Forward march, pull out your weapon aim directly for the heart
Buck the brain and make sure everything stop and listen to the shells drop
As we steady poppin round after round off trumpets fade around us
Bailin through the motherfuckin mud and rain niggas on a mission
Shirt full of bloodstains but I'm still livin
Cause I got the will and the skills
To make it out the killin field alive and killin still
This the type of shit I make you want got our suits on 
Knowin and willin to die with our boots on 
Dressed in fatigues this is real we ain't no actors
We don't wear this shit for no fashion 
You'll see how real it is when we start blasting
Fake niggas always shoot real blanks 
We in the steel tanks
If this was real they'd probably crumble 
How you come to rumble 
When you scared of what's in the jungle, nigga 
Why you tell them people you was killas
I put this on my dead thugs 
When they jump we gon tear it up 
Torpedo one bomb torpedo two to see the destruction 
Military minded so will win 
Strategize, that's all I'm fuckin bout is strategies 
It's all about reality and nigga that's me

(chorus)

Before we fight, I use my mind to pin the situation 
Makin sure the enemies weak before we invade 'em then we break 'em
Organization is a factor 
Comin from the warrior slash the mad rapper
Makin pushes jump out the bushes troopers attack
And the heads of the adversaries bring 'em back to me
If you scared you the first nigga dead 
and the field is gettin deeper 
Drama getting thicker so I pull my pistol quicker
Kill 'em all if they ain't on your team
But watch out for the spies trying to infiltrate the scene know what I mean
We headed for the justice center 
Free all the convicts and let the killas ride with us
Yeah, let's fuck some shit up and get rid of- 
The Law of course voluntarily or by force
This shit just goes on and on
It don't stop until the body rott and they casket drop
In the W-A-are we are the mighty, the mighty, the mighty mighty warriors ready
If they spittin we gone send them bitches slugs 
back it's like that buck buck buck 

(chorus)

Thugs, everywhere you see them niggas want to be 'em
Meet the real thuggish ruggish niggas out of cleveland
The wasteland warriors wild execution style find your body smelling foul
I stay thugged out and enhance my thug mentality
Gotta keep my mental sharper than a pencil
Got bullets in the clip though and you in danger 
If you anger me nigga you'll me the one that's in the chamber  
Paranoia, don't get too close I'll blow your fuckin head right off your shoulders
Cause everything to me is war I'm livin in horror
I'll die before captured (fuck that) 
fuckin with these niggas down to the last clip
Remember the casualties dearly departed 
Keep poppin at these coppers and we'll drop 'em in your honor
You can rest in peace your killas deceased

Don't give him a chance to reach

Now,what if he pull out some heat?
Shit,then we really got to kill him

Give up the dough

Join us in a battle and victory
Go down in history

Fuck 'em

Cause we simply get the raw end
Coffins open
Dump 'em all in
We can get down on them po-po
When we finished 
They ain't trippin no more
Get ready 
Leave one of us (?)
So my troopers got something to hope for
When we rumble,crash,collide
Now we lockin up the enemy
What that guy did to me was crude and rude
And don't give a fuck about rules
We done been screwed
Been runnin the streets to long
We know every corner,cut,and alley
So when you're patrollin 
don't pull over the wrong Caddy
Never knowin what's on our minds
Were steadily bustin at these po-po
For the hard times

No, not by the bullet
But the nigga with the heater
I'm trigger happy, I'll be in demand
I'm in command
So let's move, now you know what the enemy look like
The clones that look and sound like Bone
Give a motherfucka more than Speedknots
And when he run up to get punked, give a nigga lumps
y'all niggaz ain't mobsters
Cause if this was the mob, somebody would've been shot ya
But we can get the hole out ya

Krayzie Bone,"[Krayzie Bone]
I'm representing motherf***ing Thugline n**** (1999)
Motherf***ers want to find the real thugs and hustlers, n**** (f***ing b****es)
Come to the motherf***ing ghetto where we from n****
Now where the real thugs?

[Chorus - Krayzie Bone]
This is how we living these days [x8]
(And this is for my gangster, gangster, gangster)
(And that one's for my thugster, thugster, thugster)

[Krayzie Bone]
N**** these days we killing much quicker to get us some paper, ya feeling me?
These days you got to be packing a gun everybody your enemy
These days it's every n**** for they self
Cause it ain't no such thing as friends
And well, so nice n****z get left
And that's cause these days you got to be raw out here on the streets
Tell 'em these days you can't be f***ing with n****z that's weak
And these days no telling when you'll meet your coffin
I seen it too often that's why f*** flossing; I take caution
Don't trip, s*** if your rich your rich
Cause if you slip somebody waiting to get
At you grab ya cash and split ya s***
These days stay in the low low and away from po-po
Unless you ready to pull your fo' fo' and blow (OH!)
How come these days n****z want to be the don of the mob?
They claim it but they never qualify for the job
These days we busting at motherf***ers quicker
Simply 'cause its 1999 n**** (n**** n**** n****)

[Chorus]

[K-Mont]
Ay yo I'm straight out of the bricks and y'all ain't worthy to serve me
I'm the type that jump out your bushes and bust you with a 30, 30
You want beef? I pack pistol packing utilities
I'm the type of n**** that'll send letter bombs to all my enemies
I can't even walk the airport for being who I was
Police all on my dick because they recognize a thug
N**** we trying to get money, we don't respect the police
Until us thugs unite it ain't gon' never be no peace
N****z be going to school with nothing but murder on they minds
Giving a f*** about teachers busting shot guns and nines
Picture the scenes and screams and everybody running
Get on your knees and pray n**** cause the son of the lord is coming

[Asu]
You know what came in time that's my frame of mind
Now I'm able to separate the deaf from the weak, dumb and the blind
N****z can't get none of mine, not even some of mine
Just cause you got on a watch n**** don't mean you know the time
You stagnating, you fags hating my motion
From ocean to ocean my magic potion is devotion
The nerve to hate what I deserve to do wasn't a curse it was a signal
That's why that a** crashed for got to put on your blinker
R-W-I: rolling while infatuated
I graduated, now I want my master
Y'all done agitated disaster
And at every ends I start I slip in the art with my heart and soul
And start to roll but dumb to come
Don't become the one I fold like the lawn chair
You shouldn't have gone there
What's the deal with the long stares?
What's the purpose? Jokers on earth surface to surface
And any problem is handled the same day as service (what what what what)

[Chorus]

[Bam]
We run the blocks stop the clocks turning rocks and dice
Set trip it's our spot gave y'all shots and let the drama pop
Don't escalate the 4-5-9 just try me dead or alive
Point of survival let's get points with real n****z lives
But you only see raw meat on streets; these n****z love their heat
Nowadays all busters want to thug like me you see it be
Wasn't way so simple execution style pull the gristle
From the chair heard 'em whistle for my n**** mental
It's money, murder, riding dumping heads back to all of y'all
Since every n****'s all hard and proving they got the bigger balls
Scared of the laws told what he saw and what it looked like
Broke him off in the midnight I spared his life I said this s*** is tight

When they be fuckin' with the thugs
Nigga, we come to party
But I'll fuck up somebody

But y'all ain't feelin' me

Nigga, the realer gravedigger, brew-swig and love bud
And if you think you can hang

And I don't give a fuck if you a crip or you a blood
But when you see a thug you better show some love

Got damn, it feel good to be a thugsta
Gettin' high, smokin' weed all day
Ain't got to listen to no bitches and I'm disrespectin' laws
Just doin' it the Bone Thug way

Feel us nigga, if you want ain't of that high captain here

Fuck the law shit, been screamin' it for years
Ain't no fear in my heart thanks to the Lord up above
And I got a grudge against niggas that judge, give 'em no mercy, no love
Let me see you shoot that motherfucker shoot that nigga
Ride up, slip the clip in, any trippin' niggas spit that fire
We don't need no water, let this motherfucker burn, baby
And I know they hate me say lately, Layzie actin' shady

Hey, I'm the number 1 assassin, guess they just can't understand
I fear no man, put it on my number 1 fan
'Cause I'm a stand-up true thugsta in a league of my own
The city of Thieves is my home and I don't trust nann nigga
My mentality is thug, runnin' the streets sellin' drugs
Off this nigga gettin' buzzed packin' heat off in the club
Nigga what? Nigga what?
They sayin' that Bone was split up

Just niggas jealous tellin' rumors and lies
Can eat a dick up, nigga

Nigga, stay real
Thugs get high
Why you call yourself a thug?
That's how I feel inside
And we don't wanna hurt nobody, 'body
But your fuckin' with us and we shootin' up the party
Even if you was talkin' some of that Bone shit we sayin'
Then you can bring it on because we ready, we ready

Fuckin' with us is like fuckin' with no condom
That's dumb, better play with your son
Nigga, I ain't the one
Ain't a thang changed, niggas still the same, made a little change
Sendin' bullets to brain, fuck around man
Nine millimeter come and get some, get some
Shoot 'em with them hollows 'cause you know he's got his vest on
And you didn't want it to come to this, did you?

Fuckin' with them thugs, them niggas roll through
If you really want some run
(Better run)
Fuckin' with thug niggas run, run
Yeah say nigga come on
We ready for combat but y'all ain't ready
Carry a deadly machete, shred 'em, they stretched
Now they human spaghetti

Steady smooth and very eager to bury enemies
If it be necessary, then nigga wet 'em
(Go)
And I better go get 'em
We pickin' 'em off with the heater 9-millimeter
Shit to sweep the streets make niggas retreat
That's heat
Now, I repeat if you want some nigga come and get it

'Cause we still five live and vicious
Don't get it twisted motherfucker
Run up on us whenever ya wanna get down and dirty
Still stand in the Land with the slugs and my gun in my hand

Put it down to the North, South, East and West
From back in the day we claimin' the thuggish ruggish
No need to change it

Now everybody a thug
If you real throw it up but if it's fake
Kill 'em and put 'em in with the rest of them phonies
Fuck 'em and yes it's like that

Get me away from all this wickedness that done piled up on my plate
Constate hate, is it my fate
Trying to build off within me, all of these jealousies and envies
Got me watching out for my enemies, weed and Hennessy
Got my mind blurry
And everybody is so when to hurry to tell they crime story
But all the time worry, who get the glory?
When everybody got to perish, is it that money that you cherish?
Or that baby in the carriage, scared to death
Not me never, one of my baby boys is gone
Probably kicking it up in heaven, thugging at the crossroads with Tombstone
You wrong, who wrong
For packing that pipe, Mr. Officer
Got you thinking out your coffin sir
And need me 'cause I'm soft and sir

Gave my life is such a risk
Look I got my point, I'm taking my roll
But still I seem to miss
Give me about 30 minutes yo, I won't feel a thang
Except my problem changing range, and time appear empty and may (empty and may)

I'm in the bus, he in the gate

My heart dropped
Knew it was over
My life known on the outside, does not exist no longer
Caught up in this system, I'm fucked
Took my freedom away, I'm stuck
Man I pace myself night after night
Wondering what in the fuck have I done (Lord what have I done..done)
By the way my name is slim
And I'm here for murder in the first degree
On some niggaz who put up and tried to murder me
Self-defense, that ain't how the judge saw it
Said I was a menace because of my prior record and that he was sorry
That he had to do it, but hey
Shit, I believe if he was sorry, motherfucker wanting to send me away
That's why I say lets start the riot, nigga motherfuck peace (fuck peace)

I'm tired of hustlin
y'all motherfuckers think this is all a game
This shit ain't easy, this is all I know
What am I supposed to do now? huh?

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things the streets it's showin you?
Do you know, you Can't Hustle Forever?

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things the streets it's showin you?
Do you know, you Can't Hustle Forever?

It was you and me against the world
We switched the game up
Hustlin' forever together before we came up
It changed our paths we went our separate ways
No more ridin' on them niggaz for me, how I miss those days
Swore up and down you was a super thug, so it's told
But had compassion for your foes wit'cha heart of gold
While I was rappin' and singing you started slangin' and bangin'
But with money comes greed saw your heart it was changin'
Niggaz out on the street, your peeps gettin covered in sheets
You relied on heat to keep you from suffering defeat
And now you're different like these savages, you're soul golfed out
I know you're hurtin' everytime I see your soul from you
You at your crossroads, whatcho gonna do?
Where you going, boo?
Street is watchin' just to take your soul from you
Who will feed your seed if you're locked down, or better yet dead?
Did you live your life to the fullest when you take your last breath?
Do you know?

Do you know where you're goin' to?

Come follow me into my life, my life, my life
I'm a young hustla
This is to get paid as I stay clean away from bustas
Strugglin' is in my blood
Mentality thug, reality I'm fucked up
I gotta go get it my goddamn self, cause ain't nobody about to give me shit
Gotta go out and get the rent pay
So I'ma be out here on this block with these rocks and this glock
Until I profit could you stop it?
Mama used to say ""but until I see it better, it got to be this way""
And it don't look like I be going nowhere, nowhere
Looks like I'm stuck in this here ghetto
Even though I done got this dream of being famous
This is really short, and if I don't make it by the end of the year
Shit's feelin' to be changin' I'ma be dangerous, bangin' nigga's brain
Nigga, I'ma start sharin' my pain and bang
Hey, this shit we do for the dollar, dollar bill y'all
So, before I get killed y'all
I gotta make better ain't tryin hustle forever, ever

God, please I know you see me livin' better that this
But, truthfully it's hard for Dre to comprehend cause it's cheddar to get
If I don't hustle I can't eat
So in these streets it's you and me
Takin' these fair penitentiary chances
Plus some real finances that'll (?) me and my fam to better circumstances
Rider quote ""man even though I know I know how this game go""
Got the green light for cash and I can't let time pass
Gotta grabs mines reality's a mutha
Tryin' to hold on to all my survivin' thugs brothas
See, this life'll make you sharp and hard two clenched fists for the struggle
Ride for my thug nation that love to hustle hard
With slugs from berettas, doing dirty business
Some niggaz still can't get together collecting figgas
Make it impossible to hustle forever
But life's a struggle we gonna survive until something come along better

[Chorus: repeat 2x]
Everybody want to be thugs
They really don't cause if they lived my life they'd understand
Niggaz for they self, no love
And it ain't nothin better than a gun in hand

[Verse 1: Krayzie]
I'm lookin at all my niggaz on the corner still trying to come up on something
Like some paper, cash money
Two-double-o-zero, niggaz is desperate to make it
Battlin Satan, but the plate that he made us looks so tasty
Temptation over took my devils persuasion
Makin me chase the paper while trying to break 'em, I blaze 'em
Then I raise up, nigga that's the way thugs do it
See it don't say nothin just to find out we kinda stupid
In the streets we play for keeps
Niggaz ain't comin back for revenge or whatever, loc
We havin none of that, so scandalous
You better keep your protection
Cause the grass and the blunts ain't the only thing we wet up

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Krayzie]
See, I've been runnin from the po-po ever since I was 11
Nigga bellin, ain't tryin to get kept and slept in the cell, man
A lot like my daddy, but then again I'm like myself
Keep my nose in my business and worry about nobody else
Got a mind of my own aside from Bone
So nigga don't think that you can run up and test me when I'm alone
Cause I got the chrome
Talk mo' shit I'm still a street thug, but I make mo' hits (mo' hits)
Platinum packin magnum never leave the house without it
And if he bout it don't sing about it nigga bring up out that shit
Thugline, frontline
Nigga it ain't scared, we done time
Leatherface is on the rampage, murder mangler, strangler
What you came with it just ain't enough
To tame the thug, we aim to drain the blood from your skull
Rappin but we dangerous, dangerous

[Chorus: repeat 2x]

[Verse 3: Krayzie]
Now to my youngsters with they guns
Out on the corner perfomin tryna to be soldiers
Just remember that I told ya, slow down, down, down
I know you want to be a thug, and do what we done
But if it ain't inside your blood then this ain't the game that you tryin to
play
Just like one of my niggaz tried to hang, and he died in a day
Awww, shame, shame, shame
Bullet hit him in the brain
And he was a thug nigga, you get the picture?
Picture niggaz in a single file line
All crying, upset because their niggaz died, nobody know why
It's so many dying cause too many trying to shine
We all trying to swang on the same godamned vine
It's about that time for the thugs to unite
And let this motherfucka burn tonight (tonight, night)
If you a thug get up and join this thug nation (thug nation)
We got guns waitin (guns waitin)
Soon as the enemy run up, blaze 'em (blaze 'em)

That's my life

[Krayzie Bone]
Man since I been off in this music business shit has gotten crazy 
I gotta be dealing wit devils bitches and bustas daily
All ah dem was screamin to take me on that long ride
Journey or mission, whatever you want to call it

Other voices saying be humble man and understand
I try to be level headed but it seems the devils winnin
try to do the right thing but I always end up sinnin
Pin Me
God won't forgive you when you pray and do the same shit
So I repent, and you can't even pay yo rent
If it ain't no dollars ain't no sense right now
But as I stop and think, a nigga got kids right now
And mine got ta eat
But they can't eat if daddy's dead or in jail
So, what would you do choose heaven or hell
If it's hell, you'd probly come up fast, and die
That's why {and i} I wonder why heaven 
ain't the chance on my mind

Made me some profits, so nigga tonight my people gonna be eatin on lobster
Hate to say it, but I think these streets done really created a monster
Cause now that I see how quick I can come about breakin the law

Got me a cold ass broad, and that's something I never had
But I'm never mad cause I done snagged one bad one with my young ass

But my brother started writing home, tellin me to leave this shit alone
I say, what? nigga, he don't know that I'm too deep in this
I'm livin and breathin the street shit
And if I don't play the crook, you ain't gonna have shit on your books
Look, gimme a minute, I'll chill in a minute I promise I will

I'ma drop the dice after this last roll
Little did he know, I got no intentions on leavin this shit here
I'm feelin to get rich here

But shit went bad six in the morning crashing through my door was the Feds
And they want that bread we want you, and I'm like ooh! (shit)

All I know is life is already short
And you can bring your non-exsistance closer if you want

As the new world order takes us into the year 2000
The shadows of death over the sky causin total destruction
As we transform day into night, darkness falls down upon us
We rise from the fog uncomparable to any other form of life
Together we ride by night, unidentified, unseen, unknown
Yes we are the pirates
Our missin is to destroy enemies by any means necessary
And those who interfere with prosecution for execusion
Shall indeed be terminated any race be gone
For we are the Kneight Riduz
Killers of the night and first of our kind

Killin 'em all (till everyone fall)

Pirates got the world on lockdown, we rule from the darkness
We come from beneath the ground, so who wants to party?
We got runnin up with slugs for everybody
Renovate the town in blood with a slaughter
What's the matter? you're not soundin so tough

How many minutes ya got before you drop? been shot

Bloody bodies stacked up in a pile and set the fire
It's the pirates behind all this violence it's not the devil
It's rebellin with my shovel, with my victims lifeless

It's so hard to believe that I'm still living, I'm alive
My clock is still ticking, guessing that God is still with me (with me)
'Cause I could have been gone so many times before
Murda Mo is chasing me I'm barely escaping it
My instincts is tellin' me that I might not live long in my life (my life)
My life is a jungle I really don't love it it's really to crumble
I fight with these devils on daily basis
And I try to stay humble
Try not to fall, but what if I slip, trip?
Try to stay calm, but what if I flip?
Kill 'em all
Last night I had a long talk with myself (myself)
Drama had a nigga wondering, wondering how close am I to hell
Then I had to pray can't let them brake me, awww nah, awww nah
But it's everyday they try to make me soft
But so fried, so high is my mistake
Don't worry when I'm in the clouds
Well that's how I stay (stay)

They don't stop

Ain't nowhere to you, to you
Stop, stop, look, look, listen
Where heard them
I'm hearin' they put to get me (get me)
Can't let 'em get me
I won't stop dumpin' until my clique is empty (empty)

Squattin and schemin plottin on demon
And It's a whole lot of semen in this dick
Packin bisquit, once the bisquits is baked
It boils down to the risk us niggaz take
Try Asu and leave ya loable to get floored

Time after time, find I question my life
How I went wrong, will it ever be right?
Will I rise?  Will I fall?  Stand tall
Continue asking, but I'm knowing only God know

Time after time, find I question my life
Where I went wrong, will it ever be right?
Will I rise?  Will I fall?  Stand tall
Continue asking, but I'm knowing only God know

[Verse One]
Growing up in the hood as a hard knock
I never knew nothing too much about young
My only concern was making my money and running these streets as a thug
Instead of the birds and bees, I always talk to murderers and the G's
That coldness inside me, but I ain't trying to hurt nobody
Temptation is keeping me steadily going under
And I wonder, if I could make it through the thunder
Cause I done caused so much hurt and pain to some that ain't deserve a thang
If I could change that, it would all be rearranged
But what's done is done and I paid the price
and now I'm like, Help me Lord, to better my life, my life
Just give me the chance to prove the world that I can be the man that I am
And I plan, on keeping it realer, really slow and steady

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
So now I'm headed to the chapel and I'm fin' to try marriage
It's goin' down yeah, yeah, yeah, but what do ya know?
Who woulda knew that would make situations worse
And my curse, nothing I've tried seems to work
And I drop to my knees and I pray, yes I pray
And I wonder if I'll ever see a better day  (I need a better day)
I've seen much in my time and I think it was too much for my eyes
The wickedness pulling me closer to failure everytime I think I'm rising, yeah
But you live and you learn and try to make better, gotta get control
Then follow the Lord and who knows where you'll go, for sho'
I can see how I've been sinnin
I'm asking the Lord for a little bit of forgiving, 'giving

Excuse me, but do you know me?
You've seen me on TV and in the video
Got caught up in Crossroads forgot that we was criminals
That's right, we them same niggas to come up from nothing
To what up with them figures?

And people changed when I got in the game
Niggas call me I don't even know how you know my name?
How the fuck you get my number?
What the fuck is going on?
Then I got these haters leaving threats on my phone
They messages be records that they made just for me
I'm not on that don't give a fuck if you rap faster than me
But when it come to being the realest niggas that ever did it
You know Bone Thugs gonna be contending for that position
Listen, if why y'all niggas want to trip with us, 
Bomb ya fall with you dick in the dust
Get up, what up? Thought ya had me figured out you didn't
Remember next time, that last time that nigga wasn't bullshitting

Can't be faded keep thinking Krayzie ain't really crazy
Haters, that pressing me to make me show this lately
Afraid that they mistaken that they thinking Kray ain't hip, hip, hip
To those who pose as friends
But are phony before they can infiltrate but can't imitate us for long
They better not come talking no shit cause I'm serving 'em some
And fuck what you heard, believe what you see please

Did you hear it, hear it?

[Chorus]
Out in the streets, streets
When the thugs play out in the streets, street
We blast that pistol
You's a damn fool if you don't duck, duck, duck
We do what we gotta do to survive, gotta stay alive
Even if the nine millimeter has to whistle
We can whistle while we work

Now I remember mama told me not to be up on the block trying to push rocks
She said, 'Cause that's the reason that your brother right nowin trouble with the cops'
I said, 'No way not me, ma'
But when she turned her back I stuffed the llello in my sock
Hopped on my BMX, and I'm out
Yeah, I got what the fiends need
If you need some weed, I got it
Got the powder and can rock it for ya (rock it for ya)
My first employer was my bigger brother
Til his ass got knocked and locked the fuck up
Stuck up in that system and I miss him
But can't stop eating meals 'cause he in there
And he should be happy I'm out so I can send him commissary
As I reach my territory, I jump off my lowrider
Yeah, that's my bike but you don't tell nobody
Soon as I hit the corner the fiends was on a nigga
Had to them bustas quit hatin' just 'cause my boulder's bigger
First I bust a ten, then I bust a twenty sale
Another fifty sale, shit today the fiends are spending well
Couple hours past and I got two rocks left
And I need to get these off
Walk up a few blocks where
Them niggas think they ballin', but they smokin' man
I tell 'em, I got them double up's
And sell my dope to them
If you don't tell nobody, I won't tell nobody
Paid them niggas two for twenty
I went home and I got pissy (pissy)
Drunk as a skunk, roll me a blunt
This is shit we do everyday
We can't front, can't front

[Chorus]

Well, well, well

It was just, one of them days on the ave of Lincoln
I'm just sittin' on the mail box watchin' and thinkin'
I just bought all my rocks and the fiends is rushin'
A little boy ran in the streets and his moms is fussin'
The neighborhood watch, they called the police twice
 
And my niggas always fight over a game of dice
Everyday it's like a story, it's so much drama
My girl just found out that I'm hittin' her mama
And my niggas who went to college, they never keep in touch
And my next door neighbor, he just stole the bread truck
He also stole a taxi, would brag and wouldn't care
He started pickin' up niggaz and started chargin' 'em fare

I guess the year was about 1981
I'd say I was about eight
Standing on the corner, bullets rang out
A little hoodster exposing too much
Niggas on my block play real robbers and cops
Big sis shootin' at niggas through the mail box
'Cause motherf**kers knew it wasn't no males in the house
Momma's at work, daddy who knows?
I got tired of wearing my sister's clothes
Young and shit, already on a role
Playin' look-out for the corner dope house
Start earnin' some clout
Got bigger, developed a figure
Got me a nigga, and then my thang start learnin' the game
Separating the real niggas from the lames
The street light's 'bout to come on
I gotta go home, ain't shit changed

[Chorus]

Well, well, well, well

Yo, I got needs and stuff, I had to be poppin' marry
I hit her with the 'Is you is, or is you ain't my baby?'
I know a Tom, know a Jerry, call 'em 'Su and Eve
I be goin' down in history, not a cliff, like Heath
Where beef comes from size, and give me 'em all baby
And what, what, no motherfuckin' gravy? (no gravy?)
Y'all have made me, Taz-mania mad
An I heard Damizza got him a little Arabian lad named Hodgi
Doin' his thing like Sagi
I'm tired of seein niggas do it
Time to watch me
Y'all remember the channel, the time and place
Just get on the couch, a floor, and find a space
Moms and pops worked all week to get the phatter place

So your little ass had a TV on Saturday
I know I took ya back, you ain't gotta thank 'Su
Just remember, you rascals is little and I will spank you

Woke up this morning in a cemetery kinda weary
Looked over my shoulder and I seen somebody just been freshly buried
Was kinda scary 'cause my shirt was soaked in blood man
Shovel in my hand so I had to be the one that dug that
But I had no knowledge
I don't remember even leavin' the house man
Can't explain how I got here
It's like I was walkin' but I was unconscious
But I had to be wallin'
'Cause I seen the bloody machete ah
It was used on the victim to shred him up
Oh my god don't tell me I
Oh shit
Something's going wrong I don't know what's going on
All I know was I was home then I woke up here alone
Wondering who was in that hole I ain't stickin' around to know
My mind is blank and I'm so cold and I don't know which way to go
Runnin' in the rain
I'm barely breathin' more like wheezin'
Runnin' in the rain
How could this be what I was heavin'
I made it to my house I closed the blinds and shut the door
Somebody please tell me what's going on 'cause I don't fuckin know

Jumped in the shower washed the blood from off my body
Rolled up a blunt I'm feeling psychotic mixed me up some ginentonic
But I'm nauseous feeling woozy like I'm in the twilight zone the movie
How did I do it how did I get through it
And I wondered if anyone knew what I was doing
Sat down and clicked on the tube
Flipped to the news I'm trying to find answers
Who's body is on my hands and how did the situation get so drastic
Its madness
And I just can't take no more I passed out
Couldn't help but crash out from last night I'm dashed out
Slept for a minute but I didn't sleep to long before
I was awakin' by some heavy bangin' on my door
It was the popo 'cause inside they shined their flashlights
Gotta funny feeling this has something to do with last night
They tried to tell me that I'm wanted for kidnap and murder
Tellin' me they got proof that I murdered my ex-employer

Who be the realest, the illest, most chillest nigga

That gotta be Krayzie Jackson blazing at 'cha, doing
ya right in ya ear, so clear
Spitting verses that come thirsty for more, so I split
'em, serve 'em, twirl 'em right from the door
Now look who's back on the scene, the lyrical genius Krayzie
Style after style, I got down and get wild, like I'm
drowning a bottle of Gin, I got to
So a speech is slurring, and I see a blurry vision
nigga, you 'bout to get it, watch out
Where the gangstas at? Where the ballers at? Where the
brawlers at? Where my dogs is at?
where them niggaz that don't give a fuck about
nothing, motherfuck 'em, buck 'em and all of that
Keep it thuggish ruggish baby, baby, baby, put up the
dough if you think you can fade this, Bone, Bone
Bone, Bone, Bone
I am what I am as a thug in the Land
Never run and I stand with a gun in my hand
If you want it, come get it, we got it, this beef
inside, we ready, come bring it, come on

y'all better get outta my way, it's Kray, Leatherface
in the place, finna blow up just like a grenade
Give me pay nigga, don't try to play with my paper
this year cause I swear I'm gonna act like my name
Got a gauge and K that'll blaze in the same
Ya don't really want to play with me man
But I'ma be ready on any day, y'all just be ready for plenty pay
I bet 'cha I fade any sucka as soon as it pop
Making 'em drop, shaking the spot
One simple shot and they feel the shit done with, plus
I got something for them niggaz that come with
Run quick when my gun spit, and I bust this out in
public, on some thug shit, who the thug bitch? That'll
be T-H-you-G-L-I-N-E and yes, we be
They want to be like, they want to roll like them
original, lyrical, miracle, critical killers for real for real

Choke, choke, choke, choke, that gotta be Krayzie
Jackson blazing at 'cha, choke, choke, choke, choke..

Yea, yea, yea, yea, choke, choke, choke, choke

Let's live, let's live, let's live, let's live, let's live
Got to keep livin'
Let's live, let's live, let's live, let's live, let's live
Tryin' to stay, got to stay alive
My niggaz let's live, let's live, let's live, let's live, let's live
You should be livin'
Come on and let's live, let's live, let's live, let's live, let's live
Let's live, let's live

[Verse 1]
I look at my life and I realize I don't want to let go
No, I'm tryin' to survive I don't want to die I'm searchin' the best road
Never playin' myself, I'm playin' with death
Nigga y'all better wake up to livin' and appreciate the life ya givin'
Oh no I don't, want to go, not now man
There's too many things a nigga got planned so much to understand
Still so many goals for me to achieve in, please believe in
It's rough but still that ain't a reason, to stop ya breathin'
They ask if a nigga was scared to pass away
And I'm tellin' 'em, ""Hell yeah, I can't hug my babies if I drift and slept in Hades""
It's crazy how niggaz be killin' be sayin' they ready to die
You ready to die? I'm ready to live nigga, grow up wit my kids nigga
Ain't takin' no chances on no after life
Because there's only death after life
So I be spending my time, tryin' to stay alive
If I gotta live and let die

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now that we livin' in a world full of war and murder
But money makes the world go round and round
Everybody killin' everybody what's that sound?
How many make the heat that buck come buck 'em on down
May we all rest in peace
Looks like we gon' all rest in peace
The world R.I.P

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now everybody want to go to heaven, but nobody want to die
And that don't make sense
But let me tell ya that I know of a place where, we can go and just chill (for real)
No more crime, no more strain
No more die, no more pain
No more wasting our lives away
Got to pray, got to pray, got to pray, got to pray
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
And if ya fall, be sure to ride and everything's gonna be alright
Just keep ya eyes on ya prize
And maybe you'll make it up out of this life
We all die so young, victims of the gun
A poverty to harmony and then it marks us
My nigga you ready to end it, potnah speak for yourself
I'm down with life, and everything else to hell with death

juveniles on lockdown, women that's on lockdown [2x]

Hey young thug, it seems you got yourself
in serious situation, this incarceration
Come up a unloved youngsta in the city
but momma and daddy got all day and never listen
Now your drifting away and blowing all of your ambitions away
don't throw it all away
Your not a name, your just a number
feeling like don't nobody love ya
want to hug ya to stop ya from going under, uh-uh
I know sometimes that we may praise this life
but I'm here to tell ya that we all paod the price, so move on
And don't believe everything you be hearing on them
songs, cause sometimes the Devil can get in there and steer ya wrong

{Hook 4x}

Now this one's for my ghetto queens in the slammer
convicted now as criminals, caged up like animals
These real women stuck in this wicked prison system
look how ya living, you should be home raising your children
But your messing with that sucka that got you hooked
on wine, booked doing crime and he shook, blew your mind
Now daylight come but you can't go home
and all over the world it's the same old song
same song, same song

{Hook 4x}

Now this one's for my partners doing they time in the pen
doing 5 or to 10, tell, or 25 with an L
Never coming home no more, end up your life
your life, your life, your life
Finna guess you paid the price, can't hug ya wife
You can't even kiss ya kids and tell 'em you love 'em
won't be there to cover 'em
And nothing is worst than being away from your loved ones
I feel ya, how ya feeling?
So I gotta take the time to drop a line
I gotta take the time to let ya shine

I love music (What kind of music?)

-Layzie Bone-Chorus-
We love the Reggae and Jazz, the Rock n Roll could be cool, Alternative too/ We love the Rhythm and Blues/ But I'm a Hip-Hop Baby, from the heart, I never flip flop baby

-Layzie Bone-
If it wasn't for my music, tell me where would I be? (Where would I be?)/ Prolly standin on the hot block, sellin crack rock, runnin them streets, runnin them streets/ I say ""My music is my best friend, my confidant""/ I love the way we live us one together we the perfect bond/ Me and my radio, doin 90 on the freeway, knowin the way to go/ And I like to feel the rhythm, the beat be bumpin, don't it? And I love to give it to y'all, because I know you want it/ And if you feel like I feel, you love the Rhythm and Blues, Reggae and Jazz the Rock n Roll could be cool/ But, I'ma Hip-Hop baby, this from the heart, I never flip-flop baby/ Give me a drank and a song and I be stress free kickin it, all night long

-Krayzie Bone-
It ain't nothin like Hip-Hop music/ Careful how you use it and please don't abuse it, when you do it/ Music can keep you party people dancin and put your mind in a trancin, keep ya happy, give it a chance come on/ Just flow with the music, get blowed off the music/ When I was 13, like Dr. King ya had dream' to be one of the greatest musicians alive/ To be remembered, when I die/ I love, I love, music...it's got me stayin alive/ And if you took my mic right now, one thing you'll never do is take my love away/ Cause I'm a Hip-Hop baby, from the heart I never flip-flop baby

Tossin and turnin, I'm burnin with different melodies, words my niggas tellin me sellin it to the world/ Been rappin, since the day I heard Rakim, and Dana Dane, Doug E Fresh, Slick Rick, always been a singer mayne/ Late night foster home, workin on perfection my selection of the songs that I heard was my direction/ It's when Tommie was my girlfriend, rolled or go back/ Said ""I'm the baddest mama jamma"", half white and black/ Have my babies: D'Jodecy, sick with Serena, little breed born Bryon, Miss Moe, and Shanika/ Little Trey-Trey, Destiny, and plus Aaliyah, and the newest one is Shelby/ I can't wait till I see em (Dada), they are the music in my physical form since they was born, I've been singin wit tears in my eyes as I perform, for the whole world/ Until I die like Confuscious, tell the world my name is Bryan, I'm in love with my music/ (Yea, uh) Cause I'm a Hip-Hop baby, cause I'ma Hip-Hop baby, cause I'ma Hip-Hop baby, cause I'ma Hip-Hop

-Layzie Bone-
Now everybody got that jam, that make ya get up, want to boogy to the beat now/ And if it wasn't for the drums and the strings and the lyrics that we sing what would life really mean now?/ Would it be just as fun? Would ya, kick it the same? Could ya, live without it? Could ya still maintain? My thang, is crank up the volume because it help me escape from my problems/ Till I solve em', and I'ma solve em'/ It's all music, Bone Thugs music

Glock glock shots to the block, we creep creep
Pop Pop, hope cops don't see me, on a low key
With no regards for the law, we dodge ,em like fuck em all

Because Chamillionaire's the anwser to the game like Allen I
Middle fingaz to the sky, if they don't like that reply

Yeaah Sound of Revenge saying Universal to go get my plaque
Rappin's dead so I'ma bring it back, like DJ's do when they hear my track
Check out my track record, they'll say I'ma track wrecka

When it's time to hit the club I let my chain hang
If they got clovers on they neck we in the same gang
I'm 20 deep in V.I.P. puffin' Mary Jane
Splinters still in my hand from my woodgrain
I got homies on the West who like to gangbang
And I got homies on the East who do the same thang
I told Johhny put 50 in my pankyrang
5 karot diamond chain vvs is in it mayne
You know I rep the dirty dirty where they move cane
You know we mix purple stuff in that blue drank
Hipnotic, Big Bodies with Blue paint
We got that oomp spray, but it still stank
You a lame so yo dame playin mind games
Ima pimp so I stay in that mindframe
Niggaz talk shit untill I let that nine bang
Me and Duke in that maybach switchin lanes

Multi-colored diamonds got us shining They say our jewerly sick
Houston got a problem and you don't want nuthin to do wit it (Do you kid?)
I ain't think so I'm tippin slow
Wen my trunk is liftin' up look at the neons as they glow
Groupies never givin' up they be everywhere I go
When that elevator go up to my suite they there fo sho
Told me that she didnt care about my money Wasnt hearin it

Man... you knew that you had those warrants
You kept ignoring those warnings
You said that it was annoying
Like makin them payments wasn't important
Yo' tv in the pawn but you tell people it's in the storage
And when the police pull you over you be givin' an oscar performance
A ticket you can't afford it
With expired plates on your taurus
Your baby momma stay trippin cause none of them kids is supported
You messed up every appointment
Thats why you ain't got employment
With spiderwebs in your wallet your pockets look like they haunted
You always wanted to be famous, well you gonna get what you wanted
America's most wanted, they 'bout to see ya up on it
You normally move like a tortuise, but you get in your car and your floor it
But you can't even escape cause the repo man got you cornered

And you try to hide until the repo man come and shake up dem pockets

Til the lights turned off in your crib like lamps that ain't got no sockets
They comin' to get what you got and you tryin to say you ain't got it
You ain't paid a payment, a part of it, half a peice or deposit
So I suggest that its best that you use some reason or logic
Or the bill collect is comin' to come and see ya about it
Got it?

Yall just betta have my dough because
I'm comin around the corner hundred miles and gunnin
Finna ride by dumpin'
If anybody owe me somethin', then I strongly suggest you run it
Yall better respect the bill collecta
Or you'll get chin checked like the rest of 'em
Never did joke when it come to the decimal
When it come to gettin dough I'm a professional (fresh ya know)
In it to win it
I get to bombin in a minute
Any and every thing over three digits
These suckas they really think krayzie be slippin'
But I'm here to tell em I den already bent em
Money is a mission gotta have that dolla bill yall
Fell its really enough to kill yall
I might fall but I get right back up and still ball
Stil raw
Still get down with the buck bang
So give me all my change
Bust brains, cause I gotta maintain
Got just enough game to get me paid
Just enough aim to leave you laid

Down on the game

I kinda want to drive Lexuses 
Sit back and live life high with the best of shit 
with a wrist full of ice in my president 
And a pocket full of Debbies that you can't imagine 
Guaranteed to make the best of it 
To have a yacht on a lake with water beds in it 
And a whole to of women that are singin' to my shit 
With they hands up in the audience screamin' they want it 
They want T! 

When I was a lot younger 
I liked to sit up at the park & drink on St. Ides 
Drunk as fuck, I used to wonder why some niggas roll 64's on D's 
And some niggas let their khakis hang to their knees 
Will I end up just like one of these? 
Or smoke trees overseas and rock wimbley? 
Bring back a black Bentley full of Henessey 
And earl gray tea sippin' it with Naomi - And they on me! 
I wonder how it happened so fast 
To go from 33b to first class laughin' 
And all you haters are hurt bad 
Imagine

Before I go to sleep at night 
I say a prayer to the Lord above and I'm hopin' that he shows me love
Cause my shit be hot enough to have the world dancin' 
Smokin' weed on the beach in the sand 
and all my ladies look well in Chanel and Donna 
If I trip, they got my bail, so farewell your honor 
Ain't got no time for drama 
Too busy chillin' with the mamas in the Bahamas 
and everybody got they own bag of ganja 
And you can go & roll a bleezie of you want to 
Ain't got to worry 'bout nobody all up on ya!

Give me a house in Fayetteville and a blue five hundred 
Next door to Evander, In the tub with Michelle & Samantha 
And a black pet panther 
And you ring the doorbell, I don't answer 
And you can't stand it 
And you askin' ""TQ why you act that way?"" 
Cause it's too many haters with somethin' to say 
I'm too busy blowin' up with my homeboy J!

Bitch now its on
Thug line know I don't give a fuck (I don't give a fuck)
About you jumpin' up, actin' like you Krayzie
'Cause you Hollywood niggas can't fade this

Turn off that muthafuckin' radio
And put in a CD or a tape
And let them thug niggas show
We comin' to invade your space
In your face like ""Ho hey!""
The original, criminal, blowing up on these niggas
Give them something to listen to
Mastermind of rap or crime
Another clack of a nine
Damage your spine (spine)
Mash us and blast at your mind
Niggas really think i'm carin'
What they sayin' like they scarin' me
But all they talk is noise
I'm not a toy, so boy don't play with me
Thug Line, Thug Line
And yeah that's my clique (thats it)
And if niggas want to trip
Then we can do this shit
I'm not no muthafucking ho-nigga
I came but i can go
So nigga come on
And let me know what you down to die for
Stay strapped these days cause i don't know who to trust
So I just point my gun everywhere when I bust
Fuck these niggas
I'm in your city, your TV and your radio
So don't act like i'm hiding

Motherfuck them if they coming
We'll be waiting with the pumps
And bucking slugs into they stomach
A hundred mini-missles won't miss you
I can bet you we hit you
Split 'em, get rid of 'em
10 of them, at the same time killin' em
Keep my presence to a minimum
But i'm in your vision
Every time you see the thug line
I'm on the front line
I love mine
I'm tellin' you now
We on a mission with no mercy
want to know how bad we wan't it?
Just say we thirsty for it
And any nigga trying to get up in my way
Might i say, them bitches beggin' for a beatin'
So we left 'em bleedin'
Competition (competition), to me is an enemy
So think before you come try to get in it with me
So you can frown all you want to
Get loud all you want to
But now we see you
What you gon' do?

Now if why'all really trying to get in some action
You heard my song
Come nigga, get at me
And bring your family
'Cause we really need to practice
""Walk it, don't talk it"", I say this time after time
Have the same nerve and courage when we see you outside,
Online, all right
Lets get this party started, spark it
Thug style, showin' em love
But we stay heartless regardless
Hit 'em with bomb shit
Better ring the alarm
Its the thuggish ruggish niggas
Bustin' the gauge with one arm
Like Vietnam, the enemies expendable, so fuck 'em
First time we warn 'em
Second time we storm 'em
Nigga, you don't get no three shots
We not playin', and I know they understand
They tried to test the man
But the man was really a man
So its the plan
Stay heated heavy and ready to die
If not then eat a magnum full of hollow point shots
I'm just tryin' to make my profit,
Get up out of this shit
But until then I gotta cock my shit (I cock my shit)

Hit em home with Tha Crossroads
Dedicated to the lost souls  
Bennefit ya, forever we miss ya 
Better believe that well never forget ya 

Take a picture and capture the moment 
On a quest for the best, its victory 
Nevertheless, we stress this history

Unsolved, and it makes me wonder who really involved in killing our prophets.

You lick your lips it makes me hard

You creamin' for sex, that you gonna get this evening

To shut down you cock blockin' shit talkers

[Verse 2: Ed O.G.]
Mad niggaz think they flossin' in rap
But no one knew Boston could rap
Till Edo put this shit on the map
Now the change is drastic, Hip-Hop got Jurassic
And none of you Boston bastards made a classic
Got the right voice, make the right noise
Can't stand none of you niggaz and none of you white boys
My men's is down to take the city, hands down
From the ropes to Pakis all the way to Landsdown

[Verse 3: Big Juan]
How you gon' lie about the place that you're from?
The house you grow up in, the block that you hung
Politics ain't my fortay
You gettin' fucked without the foreplay
Heaven trouble comin' through the doorway
G ain't playin' you dubs in the clubs
And heads ain't showin' you no love in the Hub
Spend time on the road, hotel's all alone
Not for Hillstreet times ain't no place like home

[Chorus: x 4 Guru]
I'ma get home, I'ma get there
Make it back even if I'm caught outthere

[Verse 4: JaySon]
When I think of the Bean I think of the artist who
Got fucked over by Maurice Starr and Larry Wu
I think I-L-be	, fifteen years of are & be	 transmitted outside Dudley
Plus the Bumrush specially celebrities
Aks Kane, Moe Dee, Mo Vaughn and Eric B.
Murdapan, Deathchester and Glocksbury
The weed's extra sticky, coke's extra heavy

""Boston""
[Verse 5:Big Shug]
It's the chin checkin', Chuck chokin' predator
Boston rap (Big Shug) Murdapan settler (huh)
I'm bettin' the stakes be high, when you die
Diss the crew, and lose the sight in you eyes
We multiply to bring the real on the track
Cross the line and there ain't no goin' back (fuckin' fag)
In fact, these niggas will rip ya ass apart
Bury that head in Franklin and your body in Hyde Park

""Boston""
""Boston""
""Representin' mass""
""Boston""
""Fuckin' Boston""

[Verse 6: G-Squared]
We make history daily
Represent Boston like Arabs and Israelis
Police tail me, backstabbers try to nail me
DJ's play me at the clubs past eleven
On 88.9, 94.5 and Hot97
Beantown's a cold city Dorchester gritty
Murdered over a fifty, hometown ain't it shifted
I travel the map but I always come back
To burn it down behind 24 tracks

[Verse 7: Krumb Snatcha]
Shoot outs fit niggas get twist in the Bean
Below the exploded magazine leave my head on the scene
Long time to Glocksbury twist your nine on the spot
Either you out to get this paper, or you work for the cops
My don stylo finally ya niggaz know how it go
Most hated at the back with the gats at the show
Quick to die with the stripes on squeezing like a python
Half the industry ya already dead before the mic's on

[Verse 8: Akrobatik]
My rapstyle's changed like Rodman's head
It's Akrobatik representin' Common Square (Hell yeah)
Where you can hop on the Red Line
And catch me at the Middle East
Wippin' hoes close to headline
The winter's east Stone Cold like Steve Austin
But I promise my heart will never leave Boston
And that's the bottom line cause Akro say so
Intimidatin' with my pitch changed up like Pedro

Gold stud in the bottom lip, and diamonds in her tongue pierce
Shook what her mama gave her, a Playboy bunny
And plus she tail links with a major player
And that's nothing but scandal, and hot wax
Drippin' on your back, incense smoke and mad candles
Body paints, graffiti on your flesh, spray painted on the walls like vandals

A bitch or maybe two

I see a little lady walkin' with her cheeks out
Gotta pull her by her arm and see what she's about
Can we go to Hawaii so you can roll my blunts when

She's kinda cute but the bitch is gettin' weirder

Lost his mum to a drug named Heroin
Father's gone, so grandma's left with everything
Two grandkids and a daughter's coffin
I never really knew him when he was growing up
But I assumed that it was a little fucked
No parents for him to look up to
Just a brother whom I knew was a dodgy fuck
Shit, I used to think he was a dick
Tried too hard to fit
And never grow out of it

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Never left his home town
That's what probably did it
Never saw the other worlds
That he didn't want to go and get it
Occupied by fitting in where minds
A small west, small things
Make the small things feel so tall
Will he ever change?
Well apparently
He reapplied for college and was waiting for his grades
It wouldn't help his case

'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

But wait my life's out, a night out
Brothers in town, some doubt, a few fights
Now kicked out clubs, shit the suns up
One look's all it took for his girl to cuss at another
Dudes being dudes
They blow at the chest to impress these breasts
That'd just started this mess
They must protect the damsel in distress
So other girl's man decides to clench his fists
And then he threw and missed
Brother's hit, as did his
Dropped him quick, then one kick to the head
Oh shit other man is dead

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

And now he's locked away
Twenty-one years of age
How many lives must go to waste?
As far as graves
Until I see some fucking change
And I don't even know how

Fight one another now

Krept & Konan,"This is my story
This is my story

Came from radio, it was late
Left the car, went straight to my gate
Head straight
Didn't even look left
Got my key out, started hearing footsteps
Right over my shoulder
Had to act fast, I can hear them getting closer
Tryna' keep calm and put my key into the door
Thinking to myself if I don't make it then it's over
I don't know how I managed it
Ran into my mum's room panicking
Mum shouting at me ""Karl what's happening?""
Carl shouting at me ""Karl what's happening?""
How the hell did I get in this?
Tryna' hold the door but it's coming off the hinges
Somebody wake me from this dream now
Then I hear a gunshot and my mum scream out
Somebody come and save the day
Somebody take this pain away
How can I ask God for help now, when I ain't even prayed today?
Is this how my life ends? (Nowhere to run, no place to hide in)
Carl ran out of the room tryna' fight them
Two more gun shots, everything's silent
Mum ran downstairs, she's crying
And I can't move a muscle but I'm trying
Praying for an ambulance but I can't hear a siren
She said he's shot I hope she's lying
I hear her shouting out for help, I think he's dying
I'm thinking why him? Was it wrong place, wrong timing?
I see him at the bottom of the stairs
Mum shaking while the neighbors tryna' save him, heart racing,
Wishing I could disappear
And it shoulda been me but it's him lying there
And I know it isn't fair
I phone Skanks, phone Shook, my whole body's in shock,
I couldn't even shed a tear
Trapped in this nightmare, how did I get here?

This is my story
All the pain, all the things, falling on me
All the blood, sweat and tears but don't worry
Flashing lights, seen my life flash before me
This is my story
This is my story

Woke up to a ping on my blackberry
It was a message from Kone saying ""somebody tried to kill me and got my family""
I rubbed my eyes, is this a dream or reality?
Kone said ""Krept who the fuck was this mad at me?""
God, how we gon' solve this catastrophe?
Then God gave us 'Otis' it was a blessing from him
Cos it stopped us from going getting reckless on him
Thinking to quit music
Thinking to go and do something stupid
Then things fell in place and started improving
That's why I say the music chose us, we didn't choose it
Bearing in mind Kone started from scratch
Feds took his house, money, clothes, he never had jack
Then I got a call from Vash
He told us the plan so we got up in the lab
Then things started to pick up even more
Skepta hollered at me, said that we should come on tour
Skepta don't even realize what he did for us
Well if you're listening, thank you for help fixing us
From the tour, all these shows start coming in
Back on our feet now the money started flooding in
Invested in clothes and money started doubling
Now so much for struggling
Watching Kones getting back up on his feet
Thinking ""how's he coping"", I couldn't if it was me
Now Play Dirty's on the up fucking up the streets
Everyday a new city that we reach
But even though we turned around a mess
I'm sitting in my yard thinking that I could be next
Thinking ""did I give anyone his address?""
That shit that happened to Kone still playing in my head
Thinking 'bout he day it happened, when I saw his mum
And she told me ""please look after my son""
Not a single tear on her face showing
Even though I know her heart's broken
Staying strong even though we're stressing
Cos she lost her husband and that being the second
That's why the music is a must to us
Kone he's going to make it up to her

This is my story
All the pain, all the things, falling on me
All the blood, sweat and tears but don't worry
Flashing lights, seen my life flash before me
This is my story

Krept, young, reckless, live like a G
Kone and Chip got the weed
I sip Goose 'cause it represents me
Goose backwards is double O G
Get her cards and go clubs
Win girls hearts, it's all nuts
Buy spades, flash diamonds
Jack mans queen, it's all fucked
South nigga but I know north niggas
So I might go up north nigga
Krept, Kone, Chip we corporate
And hoes want to fuck with the fortunate
Go Prada man blew a bag
Obama the way I blew a rag
It's all mad side chicks complaining
Deserted her cos she weren't my main ting
Boys still chatting garbage
Nail her then I varnish
The girls that I fuck once
They get whipped and I get car sick
True them honeys on the chill
Spoon with the honey like a meal
Don't get twisted still move trill
Fizzy man up, leave man still, blah

All this weed all this drink
Can't be good for my liver and lungs
But I ain't stopping no
I know she fucking other niggas, true
I don't care I'm still hitting that pussy
See I ain't stopping no
It's like I'm sinning but winning
I'mma need forgiving
I know she's got a man
She's shown me from the beginning
Lonely night's got me raving all the time

Had a gun in his bag on the way from school
I told him, ""If you get life you're a fool""
Then he said something that stuck with me
He said, ""I'd rather do life, than have none at all""
He said, ""Krept, you made it out fam, you're cool""
He said ""Me, I slip once, then I'm through

I said, ""Bro, I'm just tryna keep you alive
I'm sick of funerals, another suit and tie
How do you expect me to tell a young G
Put down the guns? That could be suicide
For him it's kill or be killed, fam it's do or die

But I'm in too deep, fam, I'm kinda fucked
I can't think straight when man are tryna line me up""
Just visited my boy today doing life for a crime where he didn't do shit
He said, ""Krept, what's good, how's the music?""
Didn't wanna gass it up too much
You know he's stuck doing life, he might lose it
Wishing he was out living life for the movement
When the MOBOs said we were the winners, he told the whole jail ""Brap, that's my niggas""
Happy but heartbroken at the same time cause he knows he would have been on the stage with us
Man this cold world could be so vicious

Before he died, promised dad that she'd meet me
I know it ain't been easy, and I can't stay for the whole night
She hugged me with tears in her eyes

She said, your mum sent you Jamaica (Jamaica)
She told me you came back ill (back ill)

I know she always had love for me (love for me)

Growing up without my dad ever round
It's on me and I can't let him down (let him down, let him down)

My niece said ""Make sure you come back again""
Then I started thinking 'bout the hearts that I broke
Praying that the karma don't come back on them (on them, on them)
We spoke about everything (everything)
And how his wife's tryna take everything (everything, everything)
All the inheritance (inheritance)
All because he gave her a wedding ring

And I can't go back, but the more I move forward
The more I start losing the sight of things

You know that same story, yeah, that same story
Yeah you love him, he hurts you, so you leave him
Then he proves he deserves you, you forgive him
Cause you love him, you take him back and you let it slide
He gets comfy and hurts you for a second time
Now your heart's broken, you're saying that you hate men

She tells me all their problems, but I'm bad news and she knows it
And her friends keep on warning her and she know the wrap
But it's too late cause she caught up, you know the type
Said he's busy but you know it's lies, two ticks but there's no reply
Loves him but he wants me to have a argument and she phones me crying
All that Rose she's drinking ain't making it better
If she waited for me to settle down, she'd be waiting forever
She knows this, she don't say but she hates that I met her

When I put on a show, now they wanna listen
I don't know, on my life
I don't know, on my life
They say, nothing was gained, everything lost all out of heartache
But what I know, look at me now, begging for heartbreak

Yo, nigga check the stacks, check the results
We in your top five by default
I swear to God we're putting UK rap on
Playlists on national radio with a trap song
Respect the fact me and Kone opening some doors
You think they would have put a song like that on there before?
Nah, well I guess we the game changers
A lot of press on this star, we're the game's favourites
My nigga hit me, said that he was in a dark place
But our achievements inspired him, and he can't wait
To be something and chase his dream for real
Just picked my award up in front of Pharrell
Staples Center in L.A., feeling kind of major
Staples in a box, like I'm filing papers
Gonna get a mortgage off of rap, I sad that I'd do it
Now that's what the fuck I call house music
Taking pictures of this money, I'm a pick-pocket
Whip's got a fresh plate, boy I'm dish washing
Young niggas doing well, man that shit ain't often
A black nigga that balled, man that shit ain't common
They thought I'd be a typical black nigga
Making notes out of keys like a bad singer
It could have ended in a grave, so I show my blessings
Or in the can, but that's so depressing
A few of your ratings are still overdue
You still don't hear us? Then we'll grow on you
'Cause we the ones they used to stereotype
Now they play us on radio, we the stereo type
Yeah, nothing better than a proud mum
How man rappers did we outrun?
Bet they didn't think a BET would be the outcome
Wiz Khalifa told us he wants to get on the album
Yeah, shit's so surreal
Labels in the States tryna close a deal
New kids on the block, we the new wave
This good music got me two chains
I say I'm blessed but they're saying that I'm lucky
Selling fast food, I could have ended up a junkie
Look at all the people that we won over
Sex on the couch thinking that I've come so far
Could have chose to sell the green in the blocks fam
And be a green icon, that's a Whatsapp
But nah, nigga I'm just tryna live
All these awards, all that's missing is a BRIT
(Let me, let me break it down)
Money, cars and fame, what you are, a name
People think, start to change
I can try hide it, try fight it
No point, things just aren't the same
The hood just ain't the same
Crime rise, gun wars, bang bang
Might run up on you real quick
Pull it out, won't get a second chance, this ain't a game
Been there, done that, wore the T-shirt
Got the marks, scars from the wars
Tryna gain a name, make a way
Take the game, then charge through the doors
I'ma keep going, keep flowing
Keep showing 'til my arse on the Forbes
From in the hood, little crooks, to Guinness Books
Please start the applause
Please clap for me
I'm the truth, I should work in a factory
MTV lists, number one, we had to be
A mortgage deposit is what they're taxing me
Yeah, I earned this living
Move like I'm Brazilian, German whipping
When it comes to winning awards, you're my son
Because that's over 7-1
It's more than money, this material goals
I'm aware it ain't about these clothes
And that's real, I just hope that you remember me
So I'ma get my foot in the door and leave a legacy

I remember sitting in my classroom
Listening to Wiley and Dizzee Rascal
Breaking all the class rules
Now we've got more trophies than Arsenal
About a thousand on the shoes
Mummy's birthday, I put her on a cruise
Tell me what I've gotta prove
My cousin phoned me, said she saw us on the news
I was really in the street, you can go and phone much
Squeezed the gun off in the car, nearly shot my own foot
Now I'm sitting here thinking 'bout plaques and a Grammy
From me and Bounce testing out the MAC in the alley
How me made it this far's still a mystery
Dropped the mixtape and made history
Tryna do way more than they expect
Heard the top gets lonely, thank God I got Krept
They say it's our time and I don't wanna be late
I think too much cause I just wanna be great
Girls in the hotel and they don't wanna behave (behave!)
What they gonna say?
First headline show sold out in a day
I pray the fame will never change us
Had the whole arena looking like Wrestlemania
Lights everywhere
This summer, yeah we've been on flights everywhere
Egypt to L.A
Then Amsterdam, smoking weed on the stage
All the things we had to overcome
So I treat every chance like it's my only one
So fuck the fake love and the pretenders
""Don't Waste My Time"" got on Eastenders
What can they tell me?
Everywhere I go they want a selfie
I guess that's how it is when you're popular
But watch your back cause snakes ain't only on the Nokia
Sug and Travs got daughter's now
And I'm doing all that shit we used to talk about
When I was young I always dreamed that I would be this
I wish my dad was alive so he could see this

Yeah, I'ma take the long way home
I'ma take the long way home
I'ma take the long way so I can hear the beat play
I'ma take the long way home
