Fit for a King,"You can break me down
You can bury me alive
I will always stand for this
And what good are my hands if they don't fight back?
I refuse to let this die
This is my everlasting purpose
I will be the end of your lies

You call me out
Expecting me to stand still
You hold me down
Thinking I will give in to you
You may live your life in the shadow of doubt
But that's not where I will lay my head to rest

They say their words
But nothing breaks the surface
(Yet you say you believe)
We lay our heads down
For something empty
(We must be the enemy)

My words may cut like daggers
But I wasn't put here to keep my thoughts inside
I am the enemy
I am the enemy
I am the enemy!

I won't hide behind the mask
You've made for me
I won't be shut down
By the sound of desperate pleas
I won't be brought to my knees by the ones who say I'm worthless
I will never back down
I am the enemy

They say their words
But nothing breaks the surface
(Yet you say you believe)
We lay our heads down
For something empty
(We must be the enemy)
They say their words
But nothing breaks the surface
(Yet you say you believe)
We lay our heads down
For something empty
(We must be the enemy)

I am the enemy

Fit for a King,"Burn me alive and take my life back, I don't deserve this body
Every day is another battle, and I'm tired of fighting
The devil grabs my throat, and now I know that I'm not the only one to blame
Years of empty bottles and broken needles have lead me to the flames
If we know that Hell wants my body
But Heaven wants my mind
How can I come to grip with all the choices in my life?
Break away, break away
From the choices you've been faced with
You just need to let it go
Free yourself and let it go
When all hope had abandoned me, I looked above
Holding on to what's left of me, I've had enough
Serpent, burn in Hell
We are constantly being pulled under by chemicals that brings us to and end
There will be no day without a struggle, no task without payment
I've been dancing around my demons
Thinking I could heal it all alone
In pain I found myself but I've been missing You the most
Take your life back
I won't rest until I see this serpent burn in Hell
Serpent, burn in Hell",Break Away,2014
Fit for a King,"Lose yourself and the ones you love
Throwing stones at the bones.
setting fire to homes
Lose yourself and the ones you love
Throwing stones at the bones, don't end up alone
Terrified, at the thought of losing myself again
years of doubt and hate have led me to flee to your gaze
I'm prepared to lose it all
and as the skies turn pale, blood pours upon me
Bring your wrath
Let it wash over me
I just want to let go
Your venom flows through me
The worst is yet to come
Like a parasite you digging into my soul
Spirit filled these lungs, make me whole
Released from the prison of my doubt, a worn mind is opened to a truth it can't live without
I was never prepared to lose it all
But the broken will always fall
I looked to you as a friend
Save me from my end",Cleanse My Soul,2014
Fit for a King,"Let's look back, back to the moment when I followed sin with every step and every breath
I wanted what I couldn't have, it was never enough
Forgotten innocence, just a shadow of who I was meant to become.
Is this who I was meant to be?
Why can't I save me?
In pursuit of flesh, I was rotting in my own
A broken soul, searching for home
Alone and forsaken
Take me back to the days when I was young
Take me back to the days when I could feel anything
Take me back to the days when I was young
Take me back to the days, take me back to the days when I was not afraid to die
Each and every star will fade, but every night brings a new day
I can't see what's in front of me, oh help me find my way
Seeing all the right and wrong, hoping that I will stay strong
The fire in the sky will light my way back home
What are we afraid of? The past is gone, leave it behind
What are we afraid of? Resurrect the man who died inside
Words can't bring back the way that we used to be
We need guidance
We need action
When the road ahead looks bleak and the scars on our hearts have slowed our breathing
Don't let the darkness define you, step out from the shadows
Don't let the darkness define you, you are not alone
Don't let the darkness define you, you will find your home",The Final Thoughts of a Dying Man,2014
Fit for a King,"You know nothing, when you tell me
That I worship a fabricated story in the sky
Throwing away decency because you can't grasp
The life of peace and the voice of potency
Your words are wasted on me
I feel His breath and have seen great thongs
I've got nothing to hide, and nothing to lose
You can spit out your lies, while I tell you the truth
Mark my words, I won't back down
Spit out your lies
Nothing you can say will change my mind
This is my life, this is my soul
All that I see points back to the divine
This is my life, you'll never change me
Mark my words, I won't back down
Lies have put me down
Hate has shut me out
Through the trials and the pain
I will remain forever unbroken
When skin separates from bone
I'll never betray my vows
When death knocks at my door
I'll never give in to the ones who doubted
The ones who pick weak faith apart
Keep coming with broken daggers
They will never pierce my heart
You'll never change me",Forever Unbroken,2014
Fit for a King,"Save me from myself

Was the price I paid not enough
To prove my devotion to you
My body is bruised and broken
From being a faithful servant

All for you
So save from myself

Don't live for yourself

The reward is worth nothing
It all will fall
I have realized that
The prize is life step aside
I will be heard

There will be change
I will make a difference
There will be change
It's not about the things I've gained
Or the path I've chosen
I'm giving up everything I've made
Breaking free or false intentions

Fit for a King,"Hooked to the things that make us fall, and the words that burn like gasoline
We can't erase these endless thoughts,
Can't kill what fuels our apathy
We want satisfaction, we want our peace
Apathy, your satisfaction
I feel so little change, it always stays the same
And you admit to me that you're the one to blame.
We'd rather submit to a substance that hates us
Than have to earn all the things we love
How twisted have we become,
We're running out of excuses, they won't last for long
We are what's wrong
Numb tot he damage we're dealing to the ones who stand in our way
When will we see the price we'll pay?
I'd prefer to be trapped inside addiction
Chained to floor with no hope survive
Give it up you'll never escape
Put aside thoughts of love and empathy
Who cares when the problem's not ours
As long as light shines upon me, desperate words will never be heard
We are addicted to our own happiness.",Hooked,2014
Fit for a King,"Selling hope to the hopeless, ready to bleed them dry, and take their dignity
So get up on your stage and say they need what you have,
When your words mean nothing to you or me
We know that you're faking it
You may have them fooled
Will they see it's just a trick
We can see straight through you
We'll see if you can save yourself

There is no substance in what you sell
And now the world see you for who you really are

Fit for a King,"I've filled my veins with poison
And silenced my voice just to take another breath
I've broken my vows to you a thousand times before
I'm losing myself, sit back and watch me die
How can I say that I'm scared of death
When I spend each day sprinting towards my eternal grave
Every move that I make, every step that I take, crawling to my eternity
These words are my plea
Show yourself and rescue me
Kill the pain, from the curse of myself
Kill the pain, show me the way back home
Kill the pain, guide me back to you
Guide me back to you
I've let these demons bleed me dry (hollow and cold, lost and alone)
Screaming these words to the sky
Kill the hate within me
When I'm at my darkest I crave for light
But when your hand reaches out, I abandon you
Begging for death with every breath that I take
Pull me from my self made shallow grave",Kill the Pain,2014
Fit for a King,"I slam the door in my own face again
To see if I will ever change the feeling
I separate from my body
Simply just lost in my mind
If I walk and find a stone
Break it open to find my own gold
Making riches out of nothing
There is one thing, the way it's spent
Is the challenge or we'll have nothing left.
Fill my stomach with bags of salt
Dissolve like a slug but you know it's your fault
But once my remains are on the floor
I'll blossom like a flower and become a whole
Do you love when you're breaking at the seams?
Do you love when you forget what it means?
Do you love when you have nothing?

Fit for a King,"We're destroying your crown and your walls are crashing down. Wreak havoc.

Humanity has put evil on a throne, destroying the walls we built to contain our hearts; barely keeping us alive.

We've given power to the things that only wish to hold us down. It's time to wreak havoc.

I can't even remember a time when I could stand up for myself. I won't give in, I'll never surrender. No more fear, only fight.

I'm a slave, I'm a slave to nothing.

We're destroying your crown (get up, get up) and your walls are crashing down (get up, get up)

Wreak havoc.

Now is our time to rise above the fire you've cast down on us. I hear the words that you say, but at the end of the day you'll never see me surrender.

A kingdom reclaimed, the spawn of sin is shamed; reaching from the dirt as darkness falls beneath the Earth. Devouring souls of the ones who chose to stay behind; thrown into eternal prison. I'm the one who's still alive.

Only in dreams, so blindly you follow
Only in death we come to amends
This bitter pill I'm left here to swallow
Or will I see you in the end?
Why won't you answer me?
Have you turned your face away
Answer me
Is it heaven or hell where will he stay?

I'm done wondering where he went and how a good man lives to die
Desperate to hear your voice of reason

Erase the death that now haunts my every though

You always promised that this would be the last time

Nights spent wondering

You won't forget, but I'll forgive

You will create again
Don't let the sins of your past become a trend
You will feel again

Se compra popularidad
Trafican emociones

Que se cuela de noche delante del sofá
Serás un tipo original, te enseñaré a sentir
Lo que te haré cantar

De un cinco estrellas dormirás
Por las mañanas sin voz despertarás

Respirar tu aliento
Me voy pero te llevo

Vos podrías acercarte a mí

Se rompía y esto es siempre así

Tan extraño, tan extraño al fin

Yo bebía para irme de aquí

Fue amor, fue amor

Y no puedo dejar de reír

De tu depto siempre a Prix d´ami

Vos querías verme feliz
Yo quería verte revivir

Fue amor, fue amor

Es aquí que nos toco vivir
Enredados en los cables de Entel

Antes, debo confesar, no sentí placer igual
Pero la verdad es que ya, es que ya ven

Empezó a recorrerme con su boca y no estaba mal
Y su lengua parecía casi como loca, vamos a chocar

Uh, Helena

Uh, uhuhuh, Helena

Hasta aquí pude hacerlo bien
Después con su pocket me golpeó la sien
Y sacó mis pantalones sin apuro
Y tragó, tragó, tragó y había algo puro

Me quemó con la luz de un superflash
Y algo extraño comenzó a sudar
Y tan pronto desapareció este mundo
Y así fue como me fui de mundo

Antes, debo confesar, no sentí placer igual
Pero la verdad es que ya, es que ya ven

Sola en ese coche lamiendo su sal
Por un momento se olvidó de la verdad
Que todo lo que toca se esfuma
Se le esfuma, se le esfuma

No se que pensaste fue una horrible decepción

Cuando me caí me diste todo tu amor 
Cuando me solté no me tuviste compasión

Fito Páez,"Arriba todos
Es un día de sol
Fucking mezzogiorno de calor
Las flores blancas del amor
Las flores negras del dolor

Hoy frida pinta el cielo desde allá
Todo esto es un sueño, qué más da
El paraíso es un lugar, el paraíso es un lugar

No buscaría una razón
La sensación de estar colgado de un avión
Que está a un segundo de arribar
Que está a un segundo de estrellar
Que es un milagro despertar
Saber que nada es para siempre, y hoy
Desafiar a las leyes de la gravedad
Sólo reirme hasta verme flotar
No me creo que todo haya ido tan mal
Prueba el efecto de resucitar

Cuando el mundo se pone oscuro
Se pone lento, todo mal
Por el mundo yo no me dejo desanimar

Preferiría amarte y no pensar
Siempre entre tus piernas quiero más
Amar, amar, amar, amar
El paraíso es un lugar

I can't get no satisfaction
La dosis justa para la resignación
La maravilla del color
Las endorfinas del amor
Si todo se acabara hoy
Yo desearía que termine así

En el cine en el barrio de la humanidad
Ver ""lo que el viento nunca se llevó""
Y las chicas fumando nos digan que fue
Todo una broma, nada terminó

Cuando el mundo se pone oscuro
Se pone tenso, todo mal
Por el mundo yo no me dejo desanimar

No buscaría una razón
La sensación de estar colgado de un avión
Que está a un segundo de arribar
Y casi a punto de estrellar
Que es un milagro despertar
Saber que nada es para siempre y aceptar

I can't get no satisfaction
La dosis justa para la resignación
La maravilla del color
Las endorfinas del amor
Si todo se acabara hoy
Ver ""lo que el viento nunca, nunca se llevó""
Nunca se llevó
Nunca se llevó

Qué es esa cabeza gacha?

Por qué no come ni habla.

Algo andará pasando, andará rondando por Villaguay

Hay un extraño fulgor entre las flores del alba 
Ella se esconde y sus ojos no ven 
Ya, ya no hay registro de nada
Hasta que un día después, algo cambió en su mirada 
Sólo repite un fras en inglés, ojos de india sagrada

Y ella no quiso ver sus caras de terror, 
Lloraba eternamente sola

Sabios que enseñen a besar, delirium tremens
Hijos de la necesidad, lluvia de semen,
Maltratame por caridad, delirium tremens

A la intemperie de la multitud, clavado en una cruz con un ladrón a cada lado.
Viajando del jamas al que se yo, como un Indiana Jones por los suburbios de la luna.
Conserje de la torre de babel, rapsoda de burdel que busca en todas y en ninguna.

Ojos que aprendan a mirar, labios que quemen
Sabios que enseñen a besar, delirium tremens
Maltratame por caridad, lluvia de semen.
Entre tus brazos hallarás, Delirium tremens

Telarañas en la ropa, tigres en el balcón, alacranes en la boca, miedo en él corazón.
Maldito seas satanás, quítate el antifaz que en ese espejo no cabemos los dos.

Hijos de la necesidad, delirium tremens
Entre tus brazos hallarás, delirium tremens.

Y en mitad de un te quiero me olvidó 

Esperanza no tenía más que el nombre

Coleccionaba amores desgraciados

Para que sirve un corazón 
Y prendió un cigarrillo y otro mas 
Como toda esperanza se esfumó

Coleccionaba nubes de verano 
Velos de tul roidos por gusanos 
Pero quiso querese enamorar 
Como una rubia del montón 
Y que yo la sacara de la calle 
De los besos sin amor

Y vi la luz después cuando otros gatos 
Desordenan mis noches de locura 
Evoco aquellos ratos de torpes calenturas

Fumando el humo mientras todo pasa
Me gusta abrir los ojos y estar vivo
Tener que vérmelas con la resaca
Entonces navegar se hacer preciso
En barcos que se estrellen en la nada
Vivir atormentado de sentido
Creo que ésta, sí, es la parte mas pesada

En tiempos donde nadie escucha a nadie
En tiempos donde todos contra todos
En tiempos egoístas y mezquinos
En tiempos donde siempre estamos solos
Habrá que declararse incompetente
En todas las materias de mercado
Habrá que declararse un inocente
O habrá que ser abyecto y desalmado
Yo ya no pertenezco a ningún istmo
Me considero vivo y enterrado
Yo puse las canciones en tu walkman
El tiempo a mi me puso en otro lado
Tendré que hacer lo que es y no debido
Tendré que hacer el bien y hacer el daño
No olvides que el perdón es lo divino
Y errar a veces suele ser humano

No es bueno nunca hacerse de enemigos
Que no estén a la altura del conflicto
Que piensan que hacen una guerra
Y se hacen pis encima como chicos
Que rondan por siniestros ministerios
Haciendo la parodia del artista
Que todo lo que brilla en este mundo
Tan sólo les da caspa y les da envidia
Yo era un pibe triste y encantado
De Beatles, caña Legui y maravillas
Los libros, las canciones y los pianos
El cine, las traiciones, los enigmas
Mi padre, la cerveza, las pastillas los misterios el whisky malo
Los óleos, el amor, los escenarios
El hambre, el frío, el crimen, el dinero y mis 10 tías
Me hicieron este hombre enreverado

Si alguna vez me cruzas por la calle
Regálame tu beso y no te aflijas
Si ves que estoy pensando en otra cosa
No es nada malo, es que pasó una brisa
La brisa de la muerte enamorada
Que ronda como un ángel asesino
Mas no te asustes siempre se me pasa
Es solo la intuición de mi destino

Me gusta estar a un lado del camino
Fumando el humo mientras todo pasa
Me gusta regresarme del olvido
Para acordarme en sueños de mi casa
Del chico que jugaba a la pelota
Del 49585
Nadie nos prometió un jardín de rosas
Hablamos del peligro de estar vivo
No vine a divertir a tu familia
Mientras el mundo se cae a pedazos
Me gusta estar al lado del camino
Me gusta sentirte a mi lado
Me gusta estar al lado del camino

Al lado del camino
Al lado del camino
Al lado del camino
Es mas entretenido y mas barato
Al lado del camino

Yo volví con onganía y la cosa aún seguía 
Aristócratas patricios y patricias de anchorena 
Tan católicos mamones, protagonistas sin roles 
Yendo tras de un socialismo patriotero, sindicalista 
Preparados todos para aterrizar en pista 
Ya vacíos los aviones, transformados en camiones 
De intereses, balas tristes 
Y vecinas que no entienden que ha pasado 
En este barrio tan tranquilo, tan callado y quien dió 
La orden de cambiar el mundo 
De leer antena en la peluquería 
A jamás volver a sentir alegría 
Madres muy desesperadas cocinaban y planchaban 
Hoy sus hijos son caníbales fantasmas 
Los cadáveres se guardan o se esconden en el río 
En palacios de memoria ensangrentada 
Y tenemos pijas grandes, largas como mil facones 
Y anacrónicas arengas, melancólicas uniones 
La bandera enloquecida, maten a los maricones 
Que los hombres van de putas para sentirse varones 

Siempre el padre omnipresente de mirada contundente 
Que escondía un seductor muy asexuado 
Gracias papi por las flores, por las reivindicaciones 
Vos sabés los hijos nunca te fallamos 
Y si mami aún viviera, hoy sería jardinera 
En el cementerio club de las pasiones 
Yo que nunca anduve en nada, nunca me metí en política 
Simplemente fui un muchacho hedonista 
Y chiquitos y chiquitas inocentes con un arma 
Por el odio mas brutal descuartizados 
El mas fuerte penaliza, pega duro, te hace trizas 
Nada personal, naturaleza humana 
Los poderes organizan cual será la repartija de 
Los bienes de la época 

Nadie se puede salvar, nadie se puede salvar 

Sigo vivo, sigo atento, y observando con el tiempo 
Esta extraña enfermedad inclasificada 
Que te afecta muy deprisa, que te quita la sonrisa 
Cuyo síntoma es que ya no importa nada 

Argentino hasta la muerte, 
La patilla de facundo recortada de la gente, de la caras 

Y seguir comiendo mierda, cada día, cada noche 
Y explicarle al mundo entero nuestra nada de la historia universal 
De la argentina ensimismada 
Que contiene enciclopedia de uno mismo 
Y encender con la birome palabritas en el cielo, 
En el campo las espinas 
Y en el centro de mi pecho hay un bicho que camina 

Hoy la casa de mi infancia ya no existe ni hace falta 
Yo la llevo bien adentro en mis entrañas 
Toda llena de colores y de desapariciones 
Muy tempranas, muy profundas, muy amargas 

Nada ha desaparecido 
Ni la casa con 10 pinos 
Ni mi amor, ni la zamba de mi esperanza 
Es que el mundo es muy cretino 
Pero puede ser divino, si yo quiero 
Porque nada en este mundo me hace falta 
Nada mas que algunos trucos 
Un conejo, una galera, un colchón, un tocadisco y una mesa 
Y es posible que los hijos puedan cambiar lo que hicimos 
Y la casa nunca mas desaparezca 

Argentinos, argentinos, 
Qué destino mi amigo, argentinos 
Nadie sabe responder

Caminando siempre al lado del camino 
La ventaja de no pertenecer

Traía en la sangre mil generaciones del peor alcohol 
Entre los fierros, entre los sapos 
Entre el calor casi demente del arroyo seco, arróyalo

Tragar la mugre misma con la que se había alimentado

Se encontró con los tangueros, unas perras, un tumbero
Dos modernos que fumaban mucho crack, y un pirómano bombero
Todo en un pequeño agujero que decía le gustaba incendiar 
Pero que era tan, tan bueno que siempre apagaba 
El fuego que tenía la ilusión de crear 
Un planeta imaginario para amar y hacer el daño 
Donde no esté prohibido desear 
Buenos aires igualito que en los tiempos de roberto arlt 

El sabía que guardaban la mandanga en una media
En la viola, en el ropero o en el sucio bandoneón 
Los tangueros eran viejos muy dementes, muy despiertos 
Si podían no pagar, les resultaba mejor 
Y nunca tomaban mucho, les vendían a los giles 
Para que se den coraje, fuerza, coraje y valor 
Paranoica fierita: miserables mercachifles
Esto ya parece un chiste 
O me pagan o les hundo uno a uno el cañón

Narrador: se llevó toda la merca, al tumbero lo hizo socio 
Y el abuelo así un buen día lo recompensó
Le dió flores, caballito hasta el parque rivadavia
Le dió un super porcentaje y una gran comisión
Que no hiciera mucho ruido, que no fuera presumido
Guarda con los de la noche, guarda con el rock and roll
Los consejos le sirvieron, fue ganando su respeto 
Y fue clásico y astuto con la tradición 
Y así se cargo al abuelo, se quedó con todo y no desanimó

Paranoica fierita iba armado hasta los dientes
Pero ahora, treinta años después 
Lo eligieron empresario metalúrgico del año
Los muchachos se lo quieren comer
El tumbero ya no es socio, le vigila los negocios 
Y le lleva chicos del comedor popular y solidario por la patria 
Y en el baño les ofrece sueldo alto y pasión 
Le gustaba el rubiecito de ojos verdes 
Paranoica fierita: ese es un bombón 
Narrador: le decían el polaco y por un par de morlacos 
Cocinaba guiso en el comedor
Que no era ningún boludo 
Registró todo en un walkman
Sus gemidos y los de su patrón, las promesas de los viajes
Matrimonio en filipinas, los pedidos de la ropa interior
El tumbero lo sabía, el polaco era su otelo 
Y él su yago para hacerle el favor

Fito Páez,"Esta es la última canción de amor
De este siglo que pasó, pasó
Y yo quiero regalarte hoy

Algo que suene a esa música
Que ya escuchamos mil veces por radio
Y que hablaba de amor

La última canción de amor
De este sueño que pasó, pasó
Me acordé como éramos los dos

Bajo ese cielo estrellado
Divinos, dorados, borrachos perdidos
Hablando de amor

Esta pieza es para tí, clavel
Mi presente para siempre y ves, ya ves, mi bien
Y así vivimos, entregados, condenados

Abrazados, mutilados
Voy a tener cuidado porque todo con los años
Pierde aquella irrealidad

No estarán de tu lado
Y aunque lo juren y prometan
No estarán de tu lado

Existe un cielo y un estado de coma
Cambia el entorno de persona en persona
Giros 
Dar media vuelta y ver que pasa allá afuera

Flaco ¿donde estás?

Estoy juntando información
Estoy queriendo ser otro (otro tipo)
Mi necesidad se va modificando con las demás 
Así mi luna llega a vos
Así yo llego a tu luna

Todo da vueltas como una gran pelota
Todo da vueltas casi ni se nota

Parece el de otro tipo pero soy yo
Que sigo caminando igual
Silbando un tango oxidado

fumando el humo mientras todo pasa
me gusta abrir los ojos why estar vivo

en tiempos donde todos contra todos
en tiempos egístas why mezquinos

habrá que declararse un inocente
o habrá que ser abyecto why desalmado

me considero vivo why enterrado
yo puse las canciones en tu walkman
el tiempo a mi me puso en otro lado
tendré que hacer lo que es why no debido
tendré que hacer el bien why hacer el daño
no olvides que el perdón es lo divino
why errar a veces suele ser humano

no es bueno hacerse de enemigos
que no estén a la altura del conflicto
que piensan que hacen una guerra
why se hacen pis encima como chicos
que rondan por siniestros ministerios
haciendo la parodia del artista
que todo lo que brilla en este mundo
tan sólo les da caspa why les da envidia
yo era un pibe triste why encantado
de Beatles, caña Legui why maravillas
los libros, las canciones why los pianos
el cine, las traiciones, los enigmas
mi padre, la cerveza, las pastillas los misterios el whisky malo
los óleos, el amor, los escenarios
el hambre, el frío, el crimen, el dinero why mis 10 tías
me hicieron este hombre enreverado

si alguna vez me cruzas por la calle
regálame tu beso why no te aflijas
si ves que estoy pensando en otra cosa
no es nada malo, es que pasó una brisa
la brisa de la muerte enamorada
que ronda como un ángel asesino
mas no te asustes siempre se me pasa
es solo la intuición de mi destino

me gusta estar a un lado del camino
fumando el humo mientras todo pasa
me gusta regresarme del olvido

hablamos del peligro de estar vivo
no vine a divertir a tu familia
mientras el mundo se cae a pedazos
me gusta estar al lado del camino
me gusta sentirte a mi lado
me gusta estar al lado del camino
dormirte cada noche entre mis brazos
al lado del camino
al lado del camino

Y un queso ahumado a sus pechos gimen canciones redondas 
Soledad por quien preguntas sin compañía y a estas horas 
Pregunte por quien pregunte dime a ti que se te importa 
Vengo a buscar lo que busco 
Mi alegría y mi persona 
Soledad de mis pesares caballo que se desboca 
Al fin encuentra la mar y se lo tragan las olas 
No me recuerdes el mar que la pena negra brota 
En las tierras de aceituna 
Bajo el rumor de las hojas 
Soledad que pena tienes que pena tan lastimosa 

Llora sumo de limón agrio de espera y de boca 
Que pena tan grande corro a mi casa como una loca 
Mis dos trenzas por el suelo de la cocina a la alcoba 
Que pena me estoy poniendo de azabache carne y ropa 
Hay mis camisas de hilo 
Hay mi muslos de amapola 
Soledad lava tu cuerpo con agua de las alondras 
Y deja tu corazón en paz soledad 
Y deja tu corazón en paz soledad montolla 
Soledad montolla 

Por abajo canta el rió volante de cielo y hojas 
Con flores de calabaza la nueva luz se corona 
Oh pena de los gitanos 
Pena limpia y siempre sola 
Oh pena de cause oculto y madrugada remota 
Y madrugada remota",Romance de La Pena Negra,2007
Fito Páez,"Yo sólo sé que nunca estuve a la altura
Yo estaba muy pirado y vos eras tan pura
También solías ser mi muchachita punk
Pero en cualquier caso sabías amar

Recuerdo la mañana yendo al hospital
Reías como loca ibas a ser mamá
Hiciste yoga sola encerrada en el baño
Después te di la mano y pasaron los años

La vida es la reina madre de la inmensidad
La que agita las fieras, la que acerca los corazones
La música es la reina madre y ya no se hable más
Silencio que ha llegado ella con sus balas y flores

La sangre juega fuerte, no sabe pensar
Desata las tormentas, desde el más allá
Por suerte nunca me tomé nada tan en serio
Yo sé que ya está todo escrito en el viento

Y todo lo que hacés por obligación
Se lleva la alegría de tu corazón
Y quién se va a creer lo que cuentan los diarios
Yo creo en el amor a través de los años

Yo sólo sé que nunca estuve a la altura
Yo me hago el inocente y vos te hacés la dura
Igual está el amor, no se puede parar
Los hijos en el cuarto de al lado

Son los rayos del amor

No le dijeron nada a nadie 
Y se fueron a niteroi

El viaje fue divino por las rutas argentinas 
Durmieron en la calle, en las shells y en un camión 
Tomaron colectivos y en clorinda 
Cruzaron el río con dos malandras 
Tomaron cerveza e hicieron el amor 

Así fueron pasando los días 
Y yo sé bien 
Que jamás pensaron en volver atrás 

Escribamos un mensaje o llamemos a tu hermana 
Ella lo sabrá entender, es una piba legal

Si el río llegaría algún día al mar 
Una voz que andaba por ahí 
Me dijo: “tiempo al tiempo”

La verdad es que ya aprendí a esperar 
Que se escriba sola la canción

Dale tiempo al tiempo

Nace una flor un día 
Y a la misma hora muere un amor 
Es dura la caída

Cada día es una oportunidad 
De salir a la calle y enfrentar al viento 
Los sueños a veces se hacen realidad 
Dale tiempo al tiempo

Pensaba en los decadentes 
Cuántas noches en la ruta 
Hoy siguen juntos, qué bueno que está

Te acerca la distancia 
Entonces, estás vivo 

Cuidado con lo que quieres 
Porque algún día lo podés conseguir 
No se trata sólo de tu voluntad

Y la luna vuelve a brillar 
Ni siquiera una bomba lo puede parar

Se fue directo a la tribuna por ella
Caido del caballo su macho los vio
Los encontró detrás de una caballeriza
Estaban meta y enredados los dos

You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me

Uh, there I go
2 clicks north of the bronx
Whoever thought she would found love in a stereo
2 headphones and a box
She gets me up
Every morning on the walk to school
She ain't worried bout these other little kids
Cuz she told me
Everdyday they sayin something new
And you always got the illest kicks
Boom Boom tat
And she takes me out
Just so the block can see
Told me she wanted the world to know
So she makes me loud
Now the whole block wants me
But I'm all hers
And she's all mine
And even though her parents don't like me inside
Whenever her daddy comes around
We just hide
Cuz she doesn't wanna sleep without me that's why
I said

So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me
So turn me on
You can set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll find me
There you'll find me

Yeah, and she loves my sound
It's why I'm always around
One of the most popular girls
In the class
Could... attract the crowd
Yeah and she got me down
Touches the right place when I'm fizzling out
And all of her friends love me
Cuz at all of the parties
I make em bounce b-bounce
Uh, if I play the right song
She might take it off
Meaning her clothes
You know I love it when she keeps the lights on
Play the music soft
Yeah so that's what I do
Anything for my boo
But when I hear the knock on the door
I Shhh-shut up
Cuz I know my cue
But when they gone
I'm back at it
She loves this song
So I blast it
Dad gets home
I hide in the cabinet
Flip my switch
Like gymnastics
Uh and Imma always be there for you
You just gotta find my plug
I'll be right here waiting for you in the middle of these speakers
If you ever wanna find my love
So

So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me
So turn me on
You can set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll find me
There you'll find me

Uh, and she gets older
But I stay the same
And as she grows up
Her opinions change
Now she's off at college
W- are the ones like me
I just hope that one day she'll come back
To hear another song from me
But till then
I just sit in her room and collect dust
Thinkin about us
Waitin for the day she'll push my buttons
And I feel her touch
And get that rush
But I'm not what she needs
So I power down
Then right at that moment
I was found
Hello, her little sister walked in
Knew it was love at first sight
Caught a little twinkle in her eye when I made a sound
She snuck back in the same night
And even though she knows that she wasn't allowed
I know all she wanna do is be near me
One thing is that I felt the same
Wanna tell her but she can't hear me
So I said

So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me
So turn me on
You can set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll find me
There you'll find me

I can't explain.

It just floats away.

Tira um segundo pra pensar em nós
Tem a vida inteira pra esquecer de mim
Mas não vou deixar

Tive mil motivos pra dar meu carinho
Basta apenas um pra estar no seu caminho
Se algo me leva pro teu pensamento
Me distrai por um momento

E abre os olhos, vem me tocar
Eu te darei o mundo
Me beija a boca me faça mergulhar
No seu oceano

Mudo meus planos pra te provar
Somos seres humanos
Muitas palavras são poucas pra dizer
O quanto eu te amo",Abre os Olhos,2011

Estava quase no céu e insisti em ficar
Estava quase voando mas esqueci de andar
Foi preciso você chegar pra me ensinar
Estava tão perto da cura mas preferi a cama
Estava tão certo de tudo e preferia duvidar
Foi preciso você chegar pra me abrir os olhos
Era preciso seu olhar

Foi preciso você chegar
Você com o seu olhar
Foi preciso você chegar
Só você pra me animar

Estava a um passo do amor e me sentia só
Estava bem do meu lado e eu só dizendo adeus
Eu ia embora sozinho pro meu mundinho vazio
Foi preciso você voltar e falar o que eu queria
Estava em frente a mim mesmo e não reconhecia
Estava pronto pra entrar mas outra vez fiquei de fora
Foi preciso você pra me empurrar pra dentro
Foi tão lindo voce chegar

Foi preciso você chegar
Você com o seu olhar
Foi preciso você chegar

Quem complica o mundo é a gente mesmo amor

And you've forgot the rules of love that life has always taught
And if you broke as many hearts as ripples in a stream
Well, brother, here's the only way that you can be redeemed

Cross over the bridge, cross over the bridge
Change your reckless way o'livin', cross over the bridge
Leave you fickle past behind you and true romance will find you
Brother, cross over the bridge

If you have built a boat to take you to the greener side
And if that boat is built of ev'ry lie you ever lied
You'll never reach the Promised Land of love, I guarantee
Cause lies cannot hold water and you'll sink into the sea

[Chorus]

I know it isn't easy to resist temptation's call
But think of how your broken heart will hurt you when you fall
Cause some day you will find that you are hopelessly in love
And she'll belong to someone else as sure as stars above

As you're filin' out the door

That's all there is, there isn't anymore

We've shared a moment
And as the moment ends
I’ve got a funny feelin'
We're parting now as friends

Your cheers and laughter will linger after
They've torn down these dusty walls
If I had this to do again and the evening were new again
I would spend it with you again, but now the curtain falls

Your cheers and laughter will linger after
They've torn down these dusty walls
People say I was made for this
Nothin' else would I trade for this and to think I get paid for this

Thank you, goodnight

You throw in vain

He ran beside the buffalo-wrestled with the lions

His skin burned golden ember due the shine that toad had born. 

While riding back an eagle, laughing with the sun
He spied an old hairy fairy man upon the river Young.

While enchanted by the queen.
A lone shady shelter stood beckoning his lean.
And in the time it takes a pillow to figure out a face.
Out from in the white tree she rose to take its place. 

And the battle for his spirit then caused him to remain.
And he fought as a thousand Visigoths and he cursed the night in vain.
She said run away run away if you can
But last he heard a voice of...I'm my own man and this is my life... 

Off to in her castle, laid upon the stairs
She showered him with daffodils and tied ribbons in his hair.
He woke for bare a moment but she wouldn't let him weep.
With lips of only roses kissed him down to sleep.

Flying through the stars just like Peter Pan
I said

There she goes my heart again  (would you mind rolling over)

A dog, a bank account managed by Mickey Mouse
And the only thing we fight about is the Lakers

Never get the hook they just get a hand
While the crocs sing Superman till we just can't take it

In a land that was forgotten
She brought a candle to my mind
But it got no easier then
So I snuck out of her apartment
I went down to buy a premium
But all that settled was my mind, for a time
Till she showed me what a fire was

I will be a happy man if you're my sacred son
I could be a dividend if you're my only one

So I bought 12,000 acres
Suddenly it was a dozen
And for a moment I was blind but for the time 
I caught a glimpse inside the universe there
I couldn't handle the dimensions
See 2+2 can = 5 here
So I sold off unto a lamb, but it was a scam
And he giggled like he'd won the lottery

Five for Fighting,"Early one morning at county line
The swells 4-6 approaching 9
The barrel of my life hit the Malibu sky
A golden state pipe, Conchita was mine

Suddenly a local on a boogie in a thong
Cut in on my line, my barrel was gone
Her Pepperdine stud screamed, ""val that's what you get""
I shot him with a gun behind Neptune's net.

Killed a man I don't know what the fuss is
I'm just looking for some California justice

Took off in the mustang for the 395
Double double in Mohave, took a left at lone pine
I powered up the top of mt. Whitney
They may not have a jamba juice but here they'll never get me

While working my tan looked down the cliff to see
A line of black and whites dropped by a yellow jersey
Called uncle Arnie said, ""what's going on""
He said, ""new sheriff in town, name's lance Armstrong""

Killed a man I don't know what the fuss is
I'm just looking for some California justice

Hired a fixer to keep things blurry
Sent the shuttle to space for the perfect jury
The judge dropped the bar and to the court decreed
You can lay down all you like
Tell me what you see

I'm free
Heading up the Truckee River
To catch me a brown though the water makes me shiver
Mistake I made was crossing the border
Casinos for me are cooked and made to order

I didn't intend to kill the dealer last night
But I doubled down to 20, his 16 pulled a 5
Now I'm heading back to Cali bound for Tahoe City

Killed a man I don't know what the fuss is
I'm just looking for some California justice

Moral of the story keep the straight and narrow
Your eyes on the ball
Your hands off the sparrow
Every country needs one broken arrow
At least we gave you Ronnie Reagan,
Sonny and Chero

I'll meet you down behind Neptune's net
Catch my honey in the thong
Do you get it yet?
We'll catch barrels every day

Who'll be the lucky ones who make it all the way?

Chances are all they hope to be

'Cause though love can change the weather
No act of God can pull me away from you

Chances are we'll find two destinations
Chances roll away from me
Still chances are more than expectations
The possibilities over me

Until you crash what have you done, is there a better bet than love?
What you are is what you breathe, you gotta cry before you sing

Chances lost are hope's torn up pages
Maybe this time

Chances are we'll be the combination

Chances won't escape from me
Chances are only what we make them and all I need",Chances,2009

There's one thing I'd like to say

That lights these holy stars
Thank you for each and every Christmas tree

May Heaven steel your hearts
May God remind you in his grace
Though tonight I cannot touch your face
It doesn't matter if you're near or far
It's Christmas where you are

Your chair is empty at the table
Still I take your hand
As we pray for peace in this small world
On our knees we stand
Of this body of this nation
You are the heart and spine
So to each great generation
Of heroes down the line

The freedom that you provide

Five for the Gospel,"They didn't own a house, no crib no toys were waiting
Still they had their love for the child they were anticipating
He was born one winter night on a road between two towns
They wrapped him up so warm and tight and said
It looks like heaven's come down

There was a new star shining in the sky up above
By its light that winter night
They found peace and perfect love
If we want to find it, I know we always will
For that new star is shining for us still

He worried how to feed him on the trade that was all he knew
It was hard enough to make ends meet when they were only two
But the cold, the dark and hunger couldn't take away their joy
And she knew that they would find a way
For their precious baby boy

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Five Iron Frenzy,"When I was young, the smallest trick of light, 
Could catch my eye, 
Then life was new and every new day, 
I thought that I could fly. 
I believed in what I hoped for, 
And I hoped in things unseen, 
I had wings and dreams could soar, 
I just don't feel like flying anymore. 
When the stars threw down their spears, 
Watered Heaven with their tears, 
Before words were spoken, 
Before eternity. 

Dear Father, I need you, 
Your strength my heart to mend. 
I want to fly higher, 
Every new day again. 

When I was small, the furthest I could reach, 
Was not so high, 
Then I thought the world was so much smaller, 
Feeling I could fly. 
Through distant deeps and skies, 
Behind infinity, 
Below the face of Heaven, 
He stoops to create me. 

Dear Father, I need you, 
Your strength my heart to mend. 
I want to fly higher, 
Every new day again. 

Man versus himself. 
Man versus machine. 
Man versus the world. 
Mankind versus me. 
The struggles go on, 
The wisdom I lack, 
The burdens keep piling 
Up on my back. 
So hard to breathe, 
To take the next step. 
The mountain is high, 
I wait in the depths. 
Yearning for grace, 
And hoping for peace. 
Dear God... 
Increase. 
Healing hands of God have mercy on our unclean souls once again. 
Jesus Christ, light of the world burning bright within our hearts forever. 
Freedom means love without condition,
Without a beginning or an end. 
Here's my heart, let it be forever Your's, 
Only You can make every new day seem so new.

Five Iron Frenzy,"A nation stands with heart in hand
To sing their anthem proudly
Voices raised to sing their praise
Of their hollow country
All this talk of freedom
And some talk of liberty
From your plastic podium
You try and convince me

I can't fall anymore
For some silver-tongued song
Your freedom isn't free
So let me say what freedom means to

I can't see red, white, and blue waving in the air
I don't hear the bombs bursting and I don't even care
I'm sorry for my lack of faith
I'm not the greatest patriot
If this is all their is to freedom I don't want it

I can't fall anymore
For some silver-tongued song
Your freedom isn't free
So let me say what freedom means to

Pushing us a drug that you call freedom and democracy
Promise us that selfishness is the means for happiness
I burned that bridge so long ago that I can hardly see
Anything but solace in what freedom means to me

I can't fall anymore
For some silver-tongued song
Freedom isn't free
So let me say what freedom means to

It cannot mean to serve ourselves
That doesn't mean a thing
It doesn't mean to give the license
To seek ourselves in anything
That would be slavery to ourselves it isn't free

Opinions shift, a broken sift, an empty hand,
And billboards ask, 'where do they stand.'

And bring your best beau down

Fiya,"God I have been here before
When I felt like I couldn't take life anymore
I cannot find my way
Or the strength to fight another day
God I'm losing it
Feels like I cannot last through this

So won't you fix it like you did before
You're God
You're the God of the encore
God I can count on you
You're God
Like I did before
You're God
Do it again

This is not the first time that I've been afraid
And I ask myself how did I get back to this place
But I refuse to stay right here and live a life that's full of fear
God I need You now
Only you can bring me out of this

So won't you fix it like you did before
You're God
You're the God of the encore
God I can count on you
You're God
Like I did before
You're God

Fix it again

To see a sunny day

But know your breakthrough’s not far away

Remember what you prayed for
Hold on, please don’t let go in this season
Know that flowers bloom when rain falls
You just hold on

You ask when will this go away
Know that God can feel your pain
Believe He’ll never fall short of His word
Sometimes we forget that He holds us His hands

Tomorrow never comes

Trains no winning teams

Singin' for nickels and dimes
Times getting rough I ain't got enough
To buy me a bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me along, let me go home
I wann'a go back and start over

Little hotel, older than Hell
Cold and as dark as a mine
Blanket so thin, I lie there and grin
Buy me little bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me along, let me go home
I wann'a go back and start over

Aches in my head, bugs in my bed
Pants so old that they shine
Out on the street, tell the people I meet
Won'ch buy me a bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me along, let me go home
I wann'a go back and start over

Teacher must teach, and the preacher must preach
Miner must dig in the mine
I ride the rods, trusting in God
And hugging my bottle of wine

Leave me along, let me go home

Fjeld,"So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free

When you saw me I was broken
I was scattered in the dust
Like the way you feel sometimes
when you feel too much
You put your hands around my face
like a circle 'round the sun
When I thought that it was finished
it had only just begun

So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free, again

You shine across the morning
as I turn to face the east
You told me how to give away
things never meant to keep
Your love is rolling like a wave
that breaks right over me
One hand can hold the ocean
but will never stop the sea

So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free

Your skin it looks so golden
standing naked in the sun
Your soul it feels so holy
as close as the earth can come
A wave can cut a stone to sand
and the wind can break your bones
I'm wondering how you're doing now
when you are alone

So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free, once again, once again

He was just a prisoner
Prisoner of your pain
Whose sentence was to serve you
Let you love again
If you go away
He'll still be singing in his chains
Behind the walls of knowing
There was no such thing as blame

Deeper than the ocean
Wider than the sea
The loneliness you harbored from
A love that was deceived
How did you ever know
What the answer couldn't be
The dying's almost easier
Than trying to believe again

Your eyes they are so empty now
So pale in the sun
Your heart it is so weary
From not wanting anyone
With every breath you take
It's for the love that didn't come
Still longing for the day
You thought your life had just begun",Lie With Me,1997

Through your vice

I feel in ten breaths it's a miracle if we're still alive
Can you touch it? Is it real?
Paper cards that I feel
The slightest rip is a river that's overflowing me

Something happened, just above me
I've a baby inside
But I won't give birth till you insert yourself inside of me
I hear you whining, baby lively
I am an angel (hush now)
My back wings give the hardest slap that you've ever seen

Figures of 8 around your face
Elaborate, your eternity
You're so fucking fake that it’s hurting me
I'm just jealous cause you're more alive than what I'll ever be

Teach me how to lead with my middle finger
Boys growing boys growing girls into women
Teach me how to live life like I'm not a singer

What we see [what we see] everyday [everyday]
Livin' in the ghetto this is where I stay
[What we do] what we do [to get by] to get by
Live or die, the world is a ghetto

(Scarface)
Lets take a journey to the other side
Where many people learn to live with their handicaps
While others die
Where muthafuckas had no money spots
And if they did then they ass went insane 
When all the money stops

I'm from the ghetto so I'm used to that
Look on your muthafuckin map and find Texas
And see where Houston at
Its on the borderline of hard times
And it's seldom that your hear niggas breakin' and givin' God time
That's why your ass (????) and pray for me
Because I know that even I got to die 
And he got a day for me
And every morning I wake up I'm kinda glad to be alive
Cause thousands of my homeboys died
And very few died of old age
In most cases the incident covered up the whole page
From Amsterdam to Amarillo
It ain't no secret
The world is a ghetto

Chorus (Flaj)
(Bushwick Bill)
Five hundred niggas died in guerilla warfare
In a village in Africa, but didn't nobody care
They just called up the goddamn gravedigga
And said come get these muthafuckin niggas
Just like they do in the 5th Ward
In the South Park and The Bronx and the Watts
You know they got crooked cops
Working for the system
Makin' po muthafuckas out of victims
Don't nobody give a fuck about the po
It's double jeopardy if your black or latino
They got muthafuckin drugs in the slums
Got us killing one another over crumbs
Think I'm lying? Well muthafucka I got proof
Name a section in your city where minorities group
And I'ma show you prostitutes, dope and hard times
And a murder rate that never declines
And little babies sittin on the porch smellin' smelly
Cryin cause they ain't got no food in they bellies
They call my neighbourhood a jungle
And me an animal, like they do the people in Rawanda
Fools fleeing their countries to come here black
But see the same bullshit and head right back
They find out what others already know
The world is a ghetto

(Willie D)
What's up outta towner? Southern nigga downer
I wish you would bring your muthafuckin ass around here
With that hip shit shit from your block 
You fuck around and get shipped back home to ya momma in a pine box
Cause we don't play that shit in 5th Ward
We got killas and hustlas and playas to so nigga disregard
What your seeing on them western movies
cause yo! I ain't never rode a horse before
Ho, think we slow? Smash the gas
And watch how fast I'll put these hands on yo' bitch ass
Try to load them dice, you'll meet the gravedigga
Cause game recognize game scheisty ass nigga
See I done seen fools die for less
Than a goddamn cigarette butt, for fuckin' wit my set
So get that frown off your face busta
Cause you ghetto ain't no harder than mine

Flame,"I hear so many Christians, murmuring about their imperfections,
And their failures, and their addiction, and their shortcomings.
And I see so little war! Murmur, murmur, murmur.
Why am I this way? make war!

Bang with me, ba-bang bang, ba-bang with me
No more playing games mane
Cause this thang can get risky
So mane if you into Christ,
Take up!! your cross quickly
Stand fearless on the front-line
Time to come with it, do the right thing
Wake up!! And let's get it
I ain't even in the ring
They throwing bows like Riddick
Persistently attacking me
They're even in the back of me
It's either fight or loose my life
And I can't take this passively
So what you think I'm 'bout to do
I'm bout to do what I can do
Trust the one who got me through
And fight like it was after school
Never giving up, steady, standing on the battle field
Feet firm to the ground like I stepped on Chapel Hill
Flesh feeling frisky, sin persuades and tempts me
Satan cheers me on, guilt followed by conviction
It's the same ol' trap and we fall like we defenseless
Work your senses, grow in wisdom
Stand firm and be relentless

I make war!
Cause sin never sleeps
It's got me in a trance
You can see it in my dreams
I make war!
Man I beat my flesh
To the death, every breath
Like I beat my chest
I make war
Sun up
I make war
Sun down
I make war
Time in
I make war
Time out
I make war
Against lust
Against pride
Against me
Until I die

Do you even have a clue
What happened to you when He died
When that tomb got rolled when He rose in the sky
I think we emphasis sin so much
That it makes us paralyzed
And glorify struggle so much
That it makes us terrified
And de-emphasize the fact
That we have been sterilized from our own lives and thus
We gotta snap out of it
We ain't in no straight-jacket, we free
When Jesus died in our lives something strange happened
He gave us power
Yeah I know that we sinners
But since He rose He's renewing the image of God in us
Now, we gotta start making war
Now we can start saying no
To them fleshy impulses that Jesus Christ is paying for
Now we can start taking the lead
Just like the Dalai Lama and start going all out like a suicide bomber
Whatever the sin is we gotta go go go harder
By His grace no time to waste and just just just like there's no tomorrow

I make war!
'Cause sin never sleeps
It's got me in a trance
You can see it in my dreams
I make war!

Against lust
Against pride
Against me
Until I die

I'm a Christ representer, fin' to stand and deliver
Cause a lot of my believers struggle with their agenda
So I dropped this on an adat
Just so you could come play back
A hit to be encouraged that rocks you with truth from, way back
So listen up to it asap, like you do a Lecrae track
I'm spittin' written visions to put on heads like a wave cap
Sinning, naw we don't play that
Cause that's the way that a slave acts
I'm filled with the spirit so tell them dog this is payback
As you begin to copy the carbon copies of Christ
And conform to his written image you should be shinning a light
If you not, why is that?
Is it fear that's been grippin' you
Cause you scared they'll be dissin' you
Flipping birds while that spit at you
If you not, why is that?
It don't matter so bump it
Perfect love cast out fear and He ain't save us for nothing
This is a privilege (privilege)
Your life to give to Him (give to Him)
So stand firm for Him dawg and let's get it in

I make war!

It's got me in a trance

Reaching down just to rescue me from my insecurity

Way too young to know that I should open up my mouth to speak

I know the second that I came into this earth
I was made for more than heels & rocking cute designer skirts
I got a voice and though I'm scared
I feel my words carry worth
In my darkest valleys
I could see the sun above my earth
Reaching down just to rescue me from my insecurity
All of the abuse my step-father did when I was weak
Way too young to know that I should open up my mouth to speak
Now I see, all the years I lost trying find some peace
And when my father died I swore it was the end of me
But Jesus gave me hope beyond the pain of what my eyes could see
Now I stand a daughter of a Father who won't ever sleep
Truth has spoken and now that truth is here to set you free

Flame,"I hear so many Christians, murmuring about their imperfections,
And their failures, and their addiction, and their shortcomings.
And I see so little war! Murmur, murmur, murmur.
Why am I this way? make war!

Bang with me, ba-bang bang, ba-bang with me
No more playing games mane
Cause this thang can get risky
So mane if you into Christ,
Take up!! your cross quickly
Stand fearless on the front-line
Time to come with it, do the right thing
Wake up!! And let's get it
I ain't even in the ring
They throwing bows like Riddick
Persistently attacking me
They're even in the back of me
It's either fight or loose my life
And I can't take this passively
So what you think I'm 'bout to do
I'm bout to do what I can do
Trust the one who got me through
And fight like it was after school
Never giving up, steady, standing on the battle field
Feet firm to the ground like I stepped on Chapel Hill
Flesh feeling frisky, sin persuades and tempts me
Satan cheers me on, guilt followed by conviction
It's the same ol' trap and we fall like we defenseless
Work your senses, grow in wisdom
Stand firm and be relentless

Against lust
Against pride
Against me
Until I die

Do you even have a clue
What happened to you when He died
When that tomb got rolled when He rose in the sky
I think we emphasis sin so much
That it makes us paralyzed
And glorify struggle so much
That it makes us terrified
And de-emphasize the fact
That we have been sterilized from our own lives and thus
We gotta snap out of it
We ain't in no straight-jacket, we free
When Jesus died in our lives something strange happened
He gave us power
Yeah I know that we sinners
But since He rose He's renewing the image of God in us
Now, we gotta start making war
Now we can start saying no
To them fleshy impulses that Jesus Christ is paying for
Now we can start taking the lead
Just like the Dalai Lama and start going all out like a suicide bomber
Whatever the sin is we gotta go go go harder
By His grace no time to waste and just just just like there's no tomorrow

So I dropped this on an adat
Just so you could come play back
A hit to be encouraged that rocks you with truth from, way back
So listen up to it asap, like you do a Lecrae track
I'm spittin' written visions to put on heads like a wave cap
Sinning, naw we don't play that
Cause that's the way that a slave acts
I'm filled with the spirit so tell them dog this is payback
As you begin to copy the carbon copies of Christ
And conform to his written image you should be shinning a light
If you not, why is that?
Is it fear that's been grippin' you
Cause you scared they'll be dissin' you
Flipping birds while that spit at you
If you not, why is that?
It don't matter so bump it
Perfect love cast out fear and He ain't save us for nothing
This is a privilege (privilege)
Your life to give to Him (give to Him)

And Satan tried to knock Him too
But when they knocked the nails in His hands, Colossians 2
And 15, but yet I still see a common theme
That's plaguing adults, and it's plaguing the teens
When Jesus died, He did more than just give us some help
So help me understand why we still living for self
We live for our families, for our money and cars
We live for our happiness, cause our pleasure is lord
But ain't we seen yet, that that just doesn't work
Living for self can only lead to dozens of hurts
Please hear my heart, like a stethoscope
We're taking steps towards death, but looking for hope
Because we were captured by sin
We were seized, now we need to be captured again
That's why we need to pick them Scriptures up
Start praying and fasting, and ask the Father to forgive us of
Forgive us for laziness, forgive us Lord for our pride
Forgive us for worldliness, forgive us, cleanse us inside
Cleanse us Lord from telling lies, cleanse us from our selfishness
Cleanse us from our fear of man, we need more than help from this
We confess our lack of love, We confess selfish ambition
We confess to You our lust, oh Lord bring us to repentance

On the court he was short but he had a lotta heart
Picking up a basketball made him feel like there was hope
If he didn't play ball he probably be selling dope
No father figure in a single parent home
There's so much going on made him feel like he was grown
That he had to go hard in the gym like a champ
And all he thought about was him and his camp
He said fam we go'n make it that's all he had to say?

Know I gotta play hard to get the college scholarship

I wanna stand firm I wanna end strong
But I be so afraid that I'm gonna end wrong
And provide for my self again and supply for my selfish sin
In spite of the knowledge You are a perfect friend
Lord hold me up I know You hear me praying saying

I don't wanna put away
I don't wanna put away
But I don't want to ruin my life

How is it that if something being loved with the taste scrape crumbs off the plate
Let none go to waste keep eating in it eating in it take a drink eating in it
Bout a week later put none to your face exact same ingredients numb to the taste
Is my tongue in the way am I dark am I fake
Or am I just exhausted appetite lost it is my heart cold or is it just frosted
How long is my crave is is my hunger my thirst is
Having a relapse for idol God worship
I know this is dangerous wrong and deceit but it's looking so sweet like bon-a-petit
I know God is my Father and I am His son
He provides for me I should not jump the gun
Said I know this is dangerous wrong and deceit but it's looking so sweet like bon-a-petit
Voila
Then I have to tell myself He was tempted to provide for Himself too
Dry desert no food forty days forty nights think His appetite
Wasn't like Eve's or the Israelites or like yours or like mine
Then the serpent came right time right lies
But He chose to be father not fed make the same choice resist the devil's bread

When I see you homie it just looks like you gave in
I went to prayer start praying for my good friend
I took it there tears falling over your sin
And I ain't one to hurt you but I can't ignore it man
Guess you don't wanna trust the gospels so you caved in
And made excuses for your own sin
You ain't cutting off no limbs plucking no eyes or cutting no hands
When temptation starts popping like it's pay per view
You just stand there take a few to the face and you
Don't understand Satan's baiting you
And his whole plan is erasing you
You don't wanna be father you wanna be fed
Til you vomit up Satan's bread

I guess you jumped the gun again",Devil's Bread (Intro),2012
Flame,"The great deception, ception, ception, ception, ception
Ception, ception, ception, ception

See the king and the queen, they were under bosses
Ruling everything, their dominion was exhausted
(Now let every creeping thing) except for God himself
And each other, but they represented God himself

In his image of perfection, joy, bliss, it was paradise
But I can hear the ploy, the hiss (no more being nice)
Of the serpent who slithers in the grass
And calls into question, the giver of the task (are you sure)
I know they brew over me (I'm the beast of the field)
But how can I persuade them (gotta get us out their minds)
Make 'em think that they are animals (make 'em think they are the king)
Then I can degrade them (then I got 'em, I got 'em)
This is my plot, but I'll have to use their appetites to twit them in a knot
(Tell 'em they can be like God) Then maybe I can win
If I could use Adam's appetite to make him sin

[Chorus]
I never saw me stumbling, I never thought I'd fall
The day that You created me, I know You gave Your all
You put so much of You in me
I almost lost it all
The great deception (ception, ception, ception)

Look at the queen of the universe, walking in the garden
The image bearing empress, conversing with the fallen
(Serpent who was crawling) the evil spirit of Eden
Who tried to redefine the definition of freedom
Ju, ju, ju, ju, ju, ju, just eat the fruit from the tree
You are a goddess, you are deity
You are much more than God has revealed
Go ahead Eve exercise your reveal
Distinguish for yourself, good and evil
But who am I, I'm just a beast of the field
No the fruit is not lethal, just eat see how it makes you feel
And how it makes you think, and how it makes you act
Fact! Your God has been holding back
Scratch that, He is flat out lie
If you eat from the tree you will not surely die

[Chorus]

From the dawn of history, the mystery of lawlessness
Hijack the cosmic order, interrupted flawlessness
Introduce fallenness and now the servant-king
Who used to rule the land forfeited everything
And now the image bearers, Adam and Eve
Gave up their authority and were forced to leave
The sanctuary of Eden, The world was the kingdom
But Adam brought the curse
Because of his disobedience
Now demonic powers, rule the universe
Satan is the leader, and death is the curse
The Father sent Jesus, to come press reverse
But he had to hit the wilderness first
To overcome temptation, overcome sin
These are the things that are common to man
And that's exactly what he did, after the resurrection
The safest place to be is in Him for protection
For perfection
For correction
To escape the great deception

Overcome temptation
Overcome sin
Overcome temptation
Overcome sin (over-overcome sin)

After the resurrection
The safest place to be is in Him for protection (for protection)
For perfection (for perfection)
For correction (for correction)

Yes it is the testaments are very verifiable
What do you believe in? What do you abide by?
Maybe it's a mixture of different stuff tie-dye
You boys are all syncretists sinking in your own thoughts
The book that I hold to cohesive and never off
Say my book carrying lies but it's quite the contrary
66 holy scripts it's more like a library
Written by about forty authors in three different languages
English is not one of them Greek and Hebrew surely is
Inspired and inerrant woah what does that mean?
It's from God and without err in absolutely everything
Ya it addresses class in session boy I hope you learn something
Hear them lies from other guys boy I hope you turn from em
Why does it matter though? If the Bible's false or true
Matter of fact for your answer that let me caution you
Don't play with epistemology homie we need absolutes
If there's no such thing as truth then he can do what he want to do
She can do what she want to do and can't nobody say nothing
If a killer pull them choppers out and feel like spraying something
Ain't nobody say it's wrong and we all know that's a lie
Somebody outside of us has to speak and rectify
That's just what God did in the Christian holy book

This is strong evidence we posses the original text
Having these manuscripts different areas different times
Yet they all testify to the same text just blows my mind

Ain't no words to explain
How He preserve His word through desert plains and heavy rains
But they trying to tell us that the Bible's been corrected
I say they are misinformed and they might as well cut it

I'm talking real scholarly bought to bring some proof in here
P 75 codex vaticanus
These are two manuscripts from scriptures in the canon
And when I say canon I ain't talking bout he
But the collection of books that will function as the rule
Back to p 75 it's from the second century
The other's from the fourth sorry bout the history

The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love

Why does December seem sunny as Spring?
Why do I get up each morning to start happy 
And get up with joy in my heart?
Why is each new task a trifle to do?
Because I am living a life full of you

Flanagan Band,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,1998
Flance Chedros,"I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning

You can't start a fire without a spark

I check my look in the mirror
I want to change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man I ain't getting nowhere
I'm just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on baby this laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up alright
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now baby gimme just one look

You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying over a broken heart

You can't start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart

y apareció con un frac 
yo me mordía los labios 
qué padre, qué tal 

Tímido sí tímido 
tímido si tímido 

Luego en un rato bailamos 
tocando la oscuridad 
creo que me has hechizado

La luna nos sorprendió en el mar 
un solo beso y fue fatal 
se convirtió en estatua de sal

Flans,"Fue una historia de amor 
Que acabó en poco tiempo
Una unión que iba a durar toda la vida 

Los dos se encadenaron 
Al placer a sangre y fuego 
Para ser un solo aliento con eso bastaba

Como un eclipse de sol 
Dos astros luchan por ser 
Los dueños del día 
Y de las sombras también 

En un combate de amor 
Se roban luz sin saber 
Que agotan su fuerza 
En un eclipse de sol. 
Después llego la hora 
De comprender que no hay misterios, 
Que esperar sólo silencio y miradas lejanas
No, no, no hay más revancha 
Que intentar hacernos polvo, 
Desdibujados en cielos distintos.
