Tim Halperin,"All the miles and how they pass,
I know I ain’t looking back
All the years and how we change,
But this one thing still remains
All we are is what we want to be
All I know is this was meant for me

I believe that this is not the end,
But the moment we begin to understand
We’re still climbing, and we
We’re sifting through the sand
And we’re taking what we can
But in the end,
We’re still climbing

Every cut and every bruise
Every storm we didn’t choose
A call to stand up and be strong
Together we carry on
All we are is what we want to be
All I know is this was meant for me

I believe that this is not the end,
But the moment we begin to understand
We’re still climbing, and we
We’re sifting through the sand
And we’re taking what we can
But in the end,
We’re still climbing

If we never reach the top
Still you know we’ll never stop

I believe that this is not the end,
But the moment we begin to understand
We’re still climbing, and we
We’re sifting through the sand
And we’re taking what we can
But in the end,
We’re still climbing
We’re still climbing
Oh, we’re still climbing",I Believe [Itunes Exclusive],2011
Tim Halperin,"Now that you're out of my life, I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you, I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you, I'm richer

You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
Thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you, sold 9 million

I'm a survivor, I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop, gonna work harder
I'm a survivor, I'm gonna make it
I will survive, keep on survivin'

Thought I couldn't breathe without you, I'm inhaling
You thought I couldn't see without you, perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without you, but I'm lastin'
You thought that I would die without you, but I'm livin'
You thought that I would fail without you, but I'm on top
Thought it would be over by now, but it won't stop
Thought that I would self-destruct, but I'm still here
Even in my years to come, I'm still gon' be here

I'm a survivor, I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop, I'm gonna work harder
I'm a survivor, I'm gonna make it
I will survive, keep on survivin'

After all of the darkness and sadness
Soon comes happiness
If I surround myself with positive things
I'll gain prosperity

I'm a survivor, I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop, gonna work harder
I'm a survivor, I'm gonna make it
I will survive, keep on survivin'",Survivor,2016
Tim Hardin,"Gypsy woman told my mama, 'fore I was born
Got a boy-child coming, be a son of a gun
He's gonna make the pretty women, run, jump and shout
He gonna let the world know what it's all about

And I am
Everybody knows I am
Well I'm your hoochie coochie man
Everybody knows I am

On the seventh day, on the seventh week
On the seventh month, seventh doctor say
He was born for good luck, can't you see that seven hundred dollar
Don't you mess with me
Now all I want to do, is get myself a gun

Got a axe handle pistol, got a three dollar (?)
(?) tombstone bullet, and a ball and chain
And smoking TNT, drinking dynamite
I don't want (?), (?) gotta fight

Got a black cat bone, got a mojo hand
Got a John the Conquer root, gonna mess with you
Now all the pretty women, lead me by my hand

Tim Hardin,"There is a house in New Orleans 
They call the Rising Sun 
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy 
And God I know I'm one 

Oh mother tell my sister
Don't do what I have done 
Tell her to show me how down in New Orleans 
They call it the Rising Sun 
They call it the Rising Sun 

My daddy was a tailor 
He sews on them new bluejeans 
And my mama, she was a drunkard, lord
Drinkin' down in New Orleans 
Drinkin' down in New Orleans 

Now the only thing a gambler needs 
Is a suitcase and trunk 
And the only time he's satisfied 
Is when he's on a drunk

I don't want to spend the rest of my live long days

Tim Hardin,"I have lost a friend and I don't know why
But never again will we get together to die
Why after every last shot was there always another
Why after all you've hadn't got
Did you leave your life to your mother

And Honey Harlow gypsy burlesque queen
How did she know that you needed morphine
Why after every last shot was there always another
Why after all you've hadn't got
Did you leave your life to your mother

I have lost a friend and I don't know why
You kid these teardrops glisten 
I know it's hard to listen

Mmm I know you work while your friends hang about
And say: ""I told you so""
I know it's hard to listen to people
Talk about what they don't know

And Honey Harlow gypsy burlesque queen
How did she know that you needed morphine
And kid these teardrops glisten 
While your friends say: ""I told you so""
But I know it's hard to listen
To people talk about what they don't know 

I have lost a friend and I don't know why
But never again will we get together to die
Why after every last shot was there always another
Why after all you've hadn't got
Did you leave your life to your mother",Lenny's Tune,1968
Tim Hardin,"You can't judge an apple by looking at a tree,
You can't judge honey by looking at the bee,
You can't judge a daughter by looking at the mother,
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover

Oh you misjudge me,
I look like a farmer,
But I'm a lover,
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
Oh come on in closer baby,
Hear what else I gotta say!
You got your radio turned down too low,
Turn it up!

You can't judge a woman by looking at her man,

Tim Hardin,"Like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.
Like a worm on a hook,
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
If I, if I have been unkind,
I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you.

Like a baby, stillborn,
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,
She cried to me, ""Hey, why not ask for more?""

Oh like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.",Bird on a Wire,1971
Tim Hardin,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na

I don't want your diamonds or your game

You're a bonafide in every respect
You are walking through streets that mean nothing to you

The things you're saying like ""I'm so free and so wild""
And I believe it when you look in my eyes,
You offer me a life, and never lies
Least only the kind to make me smile

Your clothes are clean and your mind is productive
It shops in store where only the best buy
You're cool and hard, and if I sound like a lecher
It's probably true,
But at least there's no lecture

I really like it when you speak like a child
The crazy sayings like ""I'm so free and so wild""
You have to make a bargain with me now
A promise that you won't change somehow
No way, now how

Spent all day thinking about you
Spent all night coming to terms with it
Time and conditions are built to tame
Nothing lasts with age, so people say
But I will always try to feel the same

Tim Hart,"It's fifty long springtimes since she was a bride,
But still you may see her at each Whitsuntide
In a dress of white linen with ribbons of green,
As green as her memories of loving.

The feet that were nimble tread carefully now,
As gentle a measure as age will allow,
Through groves of white blossoms, by fields of young corn,
Where once she was pledged to her true-love.

The fields they stand empty, the hedges grow (go) free--
No young men to turn them or pastures go see (seed)
They are gone where the forest of oak trees before
Have gone, to be wasted in battle.

Down from the green farmlands and from their loved ones
Marched husbands and brothers and fathers and sons.
There's a fine roll of honor where the Maypole once stood,
And the ladies go dancing at Whitsun.

There's a straight row of houses in these latter days
All covering the downs where the sheep used to graze.
There's a field of red poppies (a gift from the Queen)
But the ladies remember at Whitsun,
And the ladies go dancing at Whitsun.

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1992

'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears

I godda go to confession. I'm gonna call the police-
I'm gonna do a bad thing.
Don't tell my mama, don't tell my papa,
Baby, I've been dreamin' bad, bad dreams.

I wanna pledge my ""allegiancy"",
But I'm a ferocious human beast
With carnal instincts.
Still, I'm a standup guy to every
Gal I meet-all those pretty girls in heat-
I godda see a priest. I godda go to confession.
I'm gonna call the police-I'm gonna do a bad thing.
Don't tell my mama, don't tell my papa,
Baby, I've been dreamin' bad, bad dreams.

Guys imagine having sex with
Every girl they see. Ever since,

Have I damaged you so bad
That I can never come back? 
Because I'm here right now
Back in the house
On our old queen bed
As you slip off your dress
It's all so familiar
Like kissing cousins
The stepped-on wife
The prodigal husband

You stumbled home late
To find me on your porch
Your red wine cheeks drained white
Like you'd seen a ghost

The sun hung solemn at noon
As you stormed through our bedroom

""It's not our bedroom,"" you cried
""You gave that up when you chose those other beds to lie in
And lie you did
How'd you weasel your way back in to me?
No, you can't come back
I hate myself when you're around""

But I'm here right now, back in the house
As you cuss me out
In that yellow nightgown
I bought for you at that shop in St. Paul
You pulled me in the dressing room to show it off
It must have been stuffed in the back of your drawer

Tim Kasher,"I've been thinking I should write some kinda lovesong for you
To prove to you I do

It shouldn't be too hard to write
I'll just think of that time I first met you in Omaha
You were stranded on Jackson with a bus fare to who knows where
I took you in right then and there
And life took on a new form

No more staying out all night
No more killing ourselves just to make ourselves feel alright
No more sleeping with strangers and those awkward goodbyes

I've never had much family never had too many friends
Then you came wandering through
And pompously I took you for granted
That's why I gotta write this little, this little love song for you

I'll sing about those Denver mornings you'd wake up bawling about a long lost kid
Your maternal instincts were kicking in
As the sun dazzled bright above the peaks
You brought home a dog you found in the alley
You said ""Can't we keep her?"" 
I said ""What kinda man would I be?""
So you bought her a collar and called her family

Writers are selfish
Writers are egotists
I'm afraid I'm as bad as it gets

I keep forgetting to censor the truth
That why I better write some kinda, some kinda love song for you
I'm driving cross country in a U-Haul
On the hunt for our new home
High atop Eagle Rock
We found a house with a big backyard
So we picked up yet another mutt
From the Crenshaw pound
Sipping coffee on the porch while the dogs wrestle on the lawn

But hey, I also believed in God

Settle down and settle down
Just settle down, settle down, settle down... 

I wanna have sex with all my old girlfriends again
I swear it's just the familiarity I miss
Ah, fuck it; it's just typical male conquest

Tim Lauer,"It's four in the morning the phone on the wall is ringing so loudly 
I'm sick of it all but what can I do 
I told you again that we're through 
The neighbors upstairs yes they know these paper thin walls let everything show 
They say keep it down but I can't with you hanging around 

[Chorus] 
Well you tell me you don't want to fight 
You're just here to see if I'm doing alright 
Well darling let me be lonely tonight 

The sound of hearts shattering down on the floor is just the same as it was once before 
My wisdom in years just won't be washed away by your tears 
Now I can see your disguise is nothing more than red lipstick 
And lies painted for me to see that you won't let me be 

[Chorus]",Let Me Be Lonely,2001
Tim Lauer,"Ms. Williams where did you stay last night 
Say you wasn't home till the sun was shining far too bright 
The way you wear your hair I know it surely was not right 
Ms. Williams could you tell me where you stayed last night 

Sun goes down and it's the same old thing 
Float the whiskey river to the mountains of cocaine 
Looking for that one true love to tell her she's a star 
Instead she's drinking with a long haired boy that plays a rock and roll guitar

[Chorus:] 
she just wants to shine 
Her heart gets broken every time but she knows some day soon she'll find 
Ms. Williams where did you stay last night

In a wedding dress that no one wore 
The whole world's on fire so she slams the door 
With a bible on the front seat and a shotgun in the floor she 
Points her headlights into hollywood because she wants so much more 

[Chorus]

[Repeat first verse]",Ms. Williams,2001
Tim Lauer,"Hail hail rock and roll 
Come here son and let me help you sell your soul 
Sit right down and everything will be just fine 
Sign right here and it will all work out in time 

Sit right down and I will tell you about the plan 
See I'm gonna make you 50 thousand dollars and I'll only take 10 million 
But did I mention I got a new mercedes benz 
Smile pretty be witty come meet your brand new friends 

[Chorus] 
Everybody thinks that you'll go far 
You're gonna be a rock and roll star 

Now you got a banker and a lawyer on 16th avenue 
That's the funny things they call you when you spend a couple extra years in school 
They got big black cars and dollar signs in their eyes too 
What is a boy like me to do 

I got this guitar I play a little out of tune 
But it makes no difference if I get all the right tattoos 
And hey get a look at these cheekbones 
Who cares if mick taylor was ever even in the rolling stones 

[Chorus]

Besides he didn't even get that far 
But me I'm gonna be a rock and roll star 
Yes I am so now we're living happy underneath the sony tree 
I got my big top 10 record on wkd? 

Something or other bartender could I have another and another and another 
You're lucky we're even drinking in this bar 

[Chorus]",Rock and Roll Star,2001
Tim Lauer,"I see her every morning as the sun drips slowly down 
Walking up on my street to her swanky little job uptown 
She's got an office with a window I'm looking out my window too 
I wish the four winds would blow and change my point of view 

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo 
She wears them high steppin shoes and her dress seems to fit so right 
I got two pair of corduroy pants everybody says they fit too tight 
I got a 3 dollar shirts on she got 55 dollar hair 
I want to pick her up and take her down but she's already been there probably two times 

[Chorus:] 
And every time I see her I just cry 
Ain't no sense in even wondering why 
She don't care about me 

I know she lives on 4th street or somewhere round about all 
I want to do is hold her hand or hang her dirty laundry out 
She's got a sister names Alice her older brother's name is bill 
She ain't got no dentist but her teeth are shiny still 

[Chorus]
 
She probably likes those older men with those big long cars and don't care much for fools like me That spend time in all these smoke filled bars 
She likes shirts and ties and cigarettes that smell like fallen leaves I just want to be the monkey That she lets climb her big tall tree 

[Chorus]",She Don't Care,2001
Tim Lauer,"Here we sit again and tales begin to spin
About the things that we've done and seen
Stories of wine glutton and glory
And the occasional altered dreams

Appetites for memories grow
As the sunshine begins to fade
Across the hill it's the same old chill
Lurking right there in the shade

Just a child with bright eyes and a smile
Laughter was all she knew
Her mama was away and all papa did was pray
So the wanderlust slowly grew

She spread her wings and a couple other things
For the medicine man downtown
With his bottle of elixir he said that he would fix her
And soon she was going down

And everyone begins to look the same
Feel the burn from the same old evil flame
We watched her fall from sweet and kind
And I wish she could come back sweet Magdeline

She was gone on a bad trip
Followed by a needle and a silver spoon
Mama sat and cried and papa told us lies
Said she'd be back real soon

Suddenly the seasons changed
From the fall back to the spring
Answers live like peasants here
When the questions reign as king

And everyone begins to look the same
Feel the burn from the same old evil flame
We watched her fall from sweet and kind
And I wish she could come back sweet Magdeline

Just a child with bright eyes and a smile
Laughter was all she knew
Mama was away and papa sat and prayed
While the wanderlust that slowly grew

She spread her wings and wanted to do things
For the medicine man downtown
And with his bottle of elixir he said that he would fix her
And soon she was, soon she was going down, yeah

And everyone begins to look the same
Feel the burn from the same old evil flame
We watched her fall from sweet and kind
And I wish she could come back
And I will really do is, wish she come back
I wish she could come back sweet Magdeline
",Sweet Magdeline,2001
Tim Lauer,"I remember as the seasons turned to fall 
Wind was sitting and the leaves fell a hinting a sign of the near winter's ball 
Chill in the air as I strolled down the front steps looking for a tale to tell 
Then she slipped me a stare as I slid into my chair she already knew me too well 

She said hello in that beautiful voice my reply was nowhere as sweet 
She seemed impressed by the state of my mess laughed at the wings on my feet 
Offered me a cigarette and before I could even refuse 
We were standing alone she was chilled to the bone she told me to sing the blues 

[Chorus:] 
Hey hey now I feel alright and I just wanted to see 
If I may if I might be the king of your world tonight 
So I told her of the books I'd read and details about the time I stole 6 dollars from a man named Jed just to turn around and pay him back 

I quoted my favorite poem but I ended it terribly wrong 
She said I understand then she clapped both her hands and said that's my favorite song 

[Chorus]

Just then a man walked in and took her away she said her sweet goodbye 
I'll see you again some day so it was over and I was standing there all alone 
And I said to myself as I dusted my shelf this time I think it was love 

[Chorus]",Wish,2001
Tim Lauer,"You say that it's over this time for good 
But this time around you know that I wish 
That you would not call me on the phone
I need to get used to being alone 
Now you tell me you want me to be your friend 
Don't you know I'll be your fool again 
You say now you're gone and you won't be back 
This time around I'm just a little bit smarter than that 
Just because you've packed your bags 
That doesn't mean that you won't return 
That's the lesson I learned the last time I let you back in 
Don't you know I'll be your fool again 

My friends tell me that they doubt it 
When I tell them I can learn to live without it 
They say it's a game that I can't win 
So you say you found a new man and he treats you fine 
You say he brings you flowers and bottles of cheap red wine 
You say you like the way he wears his hair 
But don't you know I wouldn't care if you ever walk out on him 
Don't you know I'll be your fool again",Your Fool,2001
Tim Laughlin,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

Your tender kiss,
And the wonderful things we would do.

Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

Tim Laughlin,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1994
Tim Laughlin,"Sadness just makes me sigh,
I've come to say goodbye,
Altho' I go, I've got those farewell blues.
Those farewell blues make me yearn,
That parting kiss seems to burn.
Farewell, dearie, Someday I will return.
Dreaming of you is sweet,
Someday again we'll meet.
 

",Farewell Blues,1996
Tim Laughlin,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way

Tim Laughlin,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

If there's a chance that you care
Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream,1999
Tim Laughlin,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you
",I'm Getting Sentimental over You,1999
Tim Laughlin,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1999
Tim Laughlin,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Tim Mahoney,"Fairy tales can come true
It can happen to you if you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart
For as rich as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart

And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of bein' alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

Pumpin' gasoline and countin' out of state plates

Ver o sol amanhecer
E ver a vida acontecer

Tudo vai ficar por conta da emoção

E deixar falar a voz do coração

I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Beyond the years, 
'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,
'Til birds refuse to sing,
Beyond the years, the echo of my only love 
Will still be whispering, whispering.
And if my throbbing heart should ever start repeating 
That it is tired of beating, then I'll be tired of you.",Then I'll Be Tired of You,2009

She stole his heart in a pick up truck

But he let it go to his head 
Well he got jealous late one night,

Growin' up I was countin' down
Every single day
'Til we made our get away
But you said you could never see yourself
Tryin' to make a life anywhere else
This would be your home
And I was on my own

But ever since you said good bye
I've been out here on the wind
And baby you would be surprised

I've seen you in

Barefoot on the beaches
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you

Everywhere

Now days
When I'm passin' through

And I hear you're doin' fine
Livin' out by the county line
Got a man that's home every night
A couple of kids and the kind of life
That you want to lead
Guess you could say the same for me
But you and I
Made our choices
All those years ago
Still I know
I'll hear your voice
And see you down the road

Maybe in
Oklahoma
Drivin' 'cross the prairie
In Dallas, Texas
Isn't that where we
Always said we would
Like to try
Never did

Tim McGraw,"Hot sun, dancin' on the river
We'd sit on the bank and watch the world roll by
Our feet in the water, she'd press her lips to mine
We were so long on love but short on time
She could be honeymoon sweet and a little wild
And she was mine for a little while

I laugh every time when I think about us
We sent the summer out in style
She's gone but she left me with a smile
Cause she was mine for a little while

We'd take a drive and park down next to airport road
Put the seats back and watch the planes leave town
She always said nobody's strong enough to tie her down
But I wasn't lookin' for that anyhow
I knew she'd leave but I didn't know when
It matters, but didn't back then

I laugh when I start to think about us
We sent the summer out in style
She's gone but she left me with a smile
?Cause she was mine for a little while

I keep seeing pictures now of me and her
And those summer nights
My minds filled with her, oh and it's alright

We called him freckled faced red headed fool 
He was different he wasn't cool like me 
Sticks and stones didn't break any bones 
Bet we never left well enough alone 
And one day he ran away from home  you see 
And I passed him as he walked away 
And in his eyes I heard him say 
""One of these days you're gonna love me 
You'll sit down by yourself and think 
About the times you pushed and shoved me 
And what good friends we might've been 
And then you're gonna sigh a little 
Maybe even cry a little but 
One of these days you're gonna love me"" 

Patty Sue was a small town beauty 
I took one look at her and had to pull her to me 
Lord knows she should've seen right through me 
When I promised her the world 
But at seventeen, you only want one thing 
I left her standin' there with my high school ring 
Innocent tears in the pourin' rain 
As I walked away 
And I still see her in my dreams 
And to this day she's whispering 

""One of these days you're gonna love me 
You'll sit down by yourself and think 
About the time you turned from me 
And what good friends we might've been 
And then you're gonna sigh a little

The congregation sings 
It's a song of sweet forgiveness 
And as the chorus rings 
The wind blows clear my memory

One of these days I'm gonna love me 
And feel the joy of sweet release 
One of these days, I'll rise above me 
And at last I'll find some peace 
Then I'm gonna smile a little 
Maybe even laugh a little but

I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close, to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

Well I'm from
A map dot
A stop sign on a blacktop
I caught the first bus, I could hop from there
But all o' this glitter is gettin' dark
There's concrete glowin' in the city park
I don't know who my neighbors are
And there's bars on the corner and bars on my heart

Point our rockin' chairs towards the west

End of an era and the turning of a page
Now it's time to focus in on where I go from here
Lord have mercy on my next thirty years

In my next thirty years I'm gonna have some fun
Try to forget about all the crazy things I've done
Maybe now I've conquered all my adolescent fears
And I'll do it better in my next thirty years

My next thirty years I'm gonna settle all the scores
Cry a little less, laugh a little more
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what I'm doin' here in my next thirty years

For my next thirty years I'm gonna watch my weight
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers
Maybe I'll remember my next thirty years

My next thirty years will be the best years of my life
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear
Make up for lost time here in my next thirty years

And she said ""somebody must be prayin' for me

Must be angels I can't see

I bought a Coke and some gasoline
And I drove out to the County Fair
And when I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh a sailor's sky made a perfect sunset
And that's a day I'll never forget

I had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt
She was killing me in that mini-skirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a sun tan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
A heart don't forget something like that

To meet some friends of mine for the Mardi Gras

Coming from a few rows back
When I looked I couldn't believe just what I saw

She said I bet you don't remember me

And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother
Like ice cream melting, they embraced
Years of bad decisions running down her face
All morning I'd been thinking my life's so hard
And they wore everything they owned, living in a car
I wanted to tell them it would be ok
But I just got in my Suburban, and I, I drove away

I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry

Keep having this dream about my old man
I'm ten years old and he's holding my hand
We're talking on the front porch watching the sun go down
But it was just a dream, he was a slave to his job and he couldn't be around
So many things I want to say to him
I just placed a rose on his grave and I talked to the wind

I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry

I'm sitting here with my kids and my wife and everything that I hold dear in my life
We say Grace and thank the Lord, got so much to be thankful for
Then its up the stairs and off to bed
And my little girl says ""I haven't had my story yet""

Of all the horizons we have seen 
And as another day is sinking 
I thank God you're here with me

Tim McGraw,"If I lived and breathed before you loved me, I don't recall
If I walked around at all, it was in bits and pieces
Of a jagged heart
You kissed me and every piece went back in place, every pain got erased
You held me up to the sunlight, now it feels like

No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You're here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see you smile feel my soul again
And I'm unbroken

If I doubted the power of love, baby now I understand
I thank God for every day I wake up to the soft touch
Of your magic hands
In this world sometimes the only thing that's real is the way you make me feel
Babe, the changes day and night
I swear it's life

No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You're here, now my heart's unbroken

Tim McGraw,"I remember Sunday mornings walking on the beach
And that place we'd stop for breakfast with the old red vinyl seats
The hours of the tide chart
The way the sunlight dance upon your face

That antique roller coaster you just had to ride
I remember how you laughed at the terror in my eyes
The color and the detail
Just like it was yesterday

And I remember how you held me the night my father died
I didn't have to tell you
I just broke down and cried
You're sewn into the fabric, the pieces of my life
And I just can't remember why we said goodbye

Up and down this boardwalk lonely people sit
I know it wasn't perfect but nothin' ever is
The sails out in the harbor
Are searching for the wind

I just had to call you, I had to hear your voice
And tell you I still love you we still have a choice
You're sewn into the fabric, the pieces of my life
And I just can't remember why we said goodbye

Everything I do
Leads back to you
I know I just can't let us go

There must have been a reason, but I can't remember now

We were just about as wild as we were green
In the ways of the world
She'd pick me up in that red rag top
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops
On a summer night
Running all the red lights
We'd park way out in a clearing in a grove
And the night was as hot as a coal-burning stove
We were cooking with gas
Knew it had to last

In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl had been a mother-to-be
For two weeks
I was out of job and she was in school
And life was fast and the world was cruel
We were young and wild
We decided not to have the child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down there would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night

In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

We took one more trip around the sun
But it was all make believe in the end
And no I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then

Well you do what you do and you pay for your sins
And there's no such thing as what might have been
That's a waste of time
Drive you out of your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green
And I was in an old scene

On the day she stopped loving me
I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped loving me",Red Ragtop,2002

Do they drink beer on Friday night

At what I'd do if I could do it all again

Tim McGraw,"Like dust in the wind sand slips through your fingers
Similar to shattered dreams that still linger
Trying to succeed in whatever you do
But the failures of the past seem to laugh and mock you

I'm worse than a has been 'cause you say I never will be
I'm just tryin' to excel so you feel me
'Cause boundaries are made to be broken
And I'm leavin' all the name sayers chokin'

On the dust that I'm kickin' up behind me
It's difficult findin' words to define me
The hick hop cowboy from the D A double L A S
So fresh in the contest

Rockin' stages like Guns N' Roses
I been flowin' since Madonna was strikin' poses
I can't quit now 'cause there's too much buzz
And I'm gettin' my chance because

Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Count your blessings, can't you see?
He's smilin' on you and smilin' on me

I remember the days sittin' in the pews
When I heard the preacher sayin', ""Spread the news""
I was feelin' the blues 'til I had a chance to choose
Now I feel the love to the soles of my shoes

Try to walk in a path of the guiding light
I thank the Lord for everything when I pray at night
'Cause I can feel His strength, I can feel His power
He's the one I turn to in my darkest hour

Try to be a good man, never called a saint
Never walked on water so I know I ain't
I might swim in the whiskey
But I'm bathed in the blood of the lamb

If you want peace raise your hand
And when Heaven comes, it won't be no drama
And if you see her first say, ""Hi"" to my Mama

Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me

As you did last night
Underneath the city lights
There, walking with your friend
Laughing at the moon
I swear you looked right through me

But I'm still living with your goodbye
And you're just going on with your life

How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye?
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Like we never loved at all

You, I hear you're doing fine
Seems like you're doing well

Time is leaving us behind
Another week has passed
And still I haven't laughed yet

What your secret is

Wants to shake your hand

I swore that he wouldn't see another sunset
Next day I followed him down to the riverbank
I knew one of us wouldn't walk away

I might have had a plan, but he didn't know it
I might have been scared, but I didn't show it
That's all between the river and me
With the current and the rocks it could have been misty
He might have been sober, but I brought the whiskey
That's all between the river and me

I walked up to him, and I said his name
Just so he could see the look on my face
We stood eye to eye and toe to toe
When I told him that he wasn't gonna come back home
He raised his fist to me, but I didn't flinch
I said, ""I ain't your son, you son of a bitch.""

I might have had a knife in my back pocket
I might have pulled it out before he saw it
That's all between the river and me
I might have had a gun, but I didn't fire it
He might have tried to yell, but I kept him quiet
That's all between the river and me
That's all between the river and me

Sheriff came knocking on our front door
They said they found his body by the reservoir
Bottle in his shirt and liquor in his blood
He must have fallen in the river and he never came up

There might have been blood, but they never saw it
Just a little mud on the living room carpet
That's all between the river and me
Well, after what he done, there ain't no wonder
I can't remember how long I held him under
That's all between the river and me
That's all between the river and me
That's all between the river and me
That's all
That's all",Between the River and Me,2007

Now you're crossing that center line for the third time
Second time like this this week, had a friend ask you for your keys
You said, ""No, I'm fine.""
You sure do act like you ain't got a thing to lose
But every car you pass might be the one you take with you

You'd give your last breath to your wife
Take a bullet for your kids
Lay your life down for your country, for your Jesus, for your friends
There's a whole lot of things you say you're living for
Well, you've got to fight it somehow, stop and turn around
'Cause this ain't nothin' to die for

So what's the harm in a little fun?
'Cause you're off to work before the sun everyday
And the inbox/outbox locks you in
And the money you make ain't worth the time you spend to make your pay
The doctor says, ""Man, your numbers - they don't lie.""

Turned his collar to the cold

Tim McGraw,"Today he traded his big '98 Oldsmobile
He got a heck of a deal
On a new Porsche car

He ain't wearing his usual grey business suit
He's got jeans and high boots
With an embroidered star

And today he's forty years old going on twenty
Don't look for the grey in his hair
'Cause he ain't got any

He's got a young thing beside him
That just melts in his hand
He's middle aged crazy
Trying to prove he still can

He's gotta a woman that he's loved for a long long time at home
Ah but the thrill is all gone
When they cut down the lights

They've got a business that they spent a while coming by
Been a long uphill climb
But now the profits are high

But today he's forty years old going on twenty
And he hears of sordid affairs
And he ain't had any

And the young thing beside him
He knows she understands
That he's middle aged crazy
Trying to prove he still can

Drug me around by my headband

With just my arrow and my hickory bow

Late at night tryin' to catch a peek at me

I gave all my money, and my time
I know it's a shame, but I'm givin' you back your name, yeah, yeah

I guess I'll move along, I'm lookin' for a good time

Sail on down the line, funny how the time can go on-a
Friends say they told me so, but it doesn't matter.
It was plain to see that a small town boy like me
Just-a wasn't your cup of tea,
I was wishful thinkin'

I gave you my heart and I tried to make you happy,
And you gave me nothin' in return
You know, it ain't so hard to say, ""Would you please just go away,"" yeah, yeah

I ain't never seen him cry now I'm seventeen
Quarterback, first train, gave my high school ring
To the prettiest little girl, green eyes and red hair.
I think I might ask her to marry me tonight at the fair.
I ain't never been so torn, should I stay or leave?

I could even play ball somewhere in the fall
Live the big city life, I guess I could have it all

Man, how do you decide between real life and a dream?
Lovin' ya Ma and Pa, ya girl, and ya team
Trying to figure out the next move to make,
Trying to figure out the right road to take.
Dying to get out, but still afraid to roam.
Is it wrong to wanna leave the only place I've known?
Life as I know it is just simple and plain:
Chores, school, and practice, everyday is the same.

I'm tired of the routine and everyone knowing me.
I'm dreaming of everything the t.v. is showing me.
They promised me a full ride to UCLA,
But that's a whole 'nother world for small town G.A.

'Cause I'm torn between here and what I see over there
I pray someway that you could give me a sign

And I'm a plane flight away from seeing my first ball
I can finally see the ocean and stars of Hollywood
Say bye to this damn farm, get a tattoo on my arm
Forget these dirt roads and the way I was raised
Chase the bright lights of the California nights
Sports cars and sushi is all I see
When I order some sweet tea they start laughin' at me
Boy, this new life ain't what I thought it would be
Maybe the city life ain't made for me
Now I'm wishing I was fishin' on the lake with Dad,
And starting to realize being country ain't bad
I miss that ol' farm and that red headed girl
Waking up before the sun to help Daddy get it done.
I'm packed and headed back to the place I was born
Proud to be country and no longer torn

If I should wait or should I go, I just don't know

This song is for everybody, no matter whether you're from a small town,
The hood, the big city, it don't matter everybody's got their dreams they wanna follow
Some people are ashamed of where they're from, they don't know where they're supposed to be
Everybody find your place in life, be proud of who you are
Don't let nothing hold you back

Tim McGraw,"We were sittin' round the supper table and the buzz of the frigidaire
Was the only sound 'til momma laid down, a book she found upstairs
It was covered in dust in the back of the closet,
Goodwill box we almost tossed it out
We could have lost all those memories

There was a picture of mama in the pouring rain
Ticket stubs to a Braves game
Silver star and a baggage claim from Hanoi, Vietnam
There was a picture of him callin' on grandpa
Leather skin from a baseball
We laughed and cried, told stories all night long
From the book of John

Now the pot of coffee's almost gone, as we turn another page
We're climbing on him like a Jungle Jim, watching his hair turn gray
All the Polaroids are just reminders,
You can't hold life in a three ring binder
We flipped on through 'em anyway

There's a picture at his sister taken in July
On the steps of the church pulling out his tie
Hair's still wet from gettin' baptized, the brand new blue suit on
An old set of keys to his Chevrolet
A crumpled up receipt for a wedding ring
We watched ourselves grow up there in his arms
In the book of John

That sun came up, we were wide awake
Head to toe in black and gray
Long black Lincoln waiting down the drive
He was father, son, husband and friend
I still flip through it every now and then
When I need just a few words of advice
It's almost like he's not really gone
And I know one day I'll be passin' on

You've been goin' out now, for goin' on ten months
You already met his family, things are heatin' up

After all these years
No matter what they say, it's just not true
I don't spend all my days and all my nights
Just missin' you

I heard it from a friend of a friend
You looked amazing in that long white gown
With flowers in your hair, barefoot in the sand
Your daddy almost broke down when he gave away your hand

After all these years
No matter what they say, it's just not true

From a cold solitary prison cell

He was singing in them honky-tonks and dives
He dreamed of being somebody, now he's number 37405

And bring him all the news from way back home
It's been two birthdays since he's kissed her,
Five seconds since he's missed her
Now the perfume on those letters ain't that strong

He's got too much time to think about the night he had too much to drink
And all his buddies, they begged him not to drive
Mr. Life of the Party, he's now number 37405

Old judge on the bench said, ""Son, your crime's got consequences.""
It's what he told him, fifteen years ago
He took a life and that's a fact, he'd give his own to give it back
Today's the day he finally gets parole

He turns in them prison clothes, and stands there at the forkin' road
And mama prays and waits while he decides

You slow dance for 3 minutes or so, and then she whispers, ""Baby, let's go.""

Tim McGraw,"She was like a brand new song on an old guitar
Supernova in a Mason's jar,
Every boy in town wanted to show her around
And as the dirt road Finch cuts the king
Beating along this American dream
Right out out the trunk when she showed up
She had a fire sat in her faraway eyes
And I knew just where to take her that night

We got high on top of that bridge
We could see for miles, past the corn and the cotton, and the River bridge
When the sun went down, there she was
Shinning like a big old sky full of diamond dust,
I'm a cigarette burnin' slow on a summer night
She's city lights

She's like a broken heart you can't wait to have,
The shooting star that falls to fast
Try holding on, it's already gone
I searched that radio low and high
Tryina find a song that make a memory by
And I did alright, for a small town guy
But even in my old town I knew
I'd never shine this bright as her city lights do

We got high on top of that bridge
We could see for miles, past the corn and the cotton, and the River bridge
When the sun went down, there she was
Shinning like a big old sky full of diamond dust
I'm a cigarette burnin' slow on a summer night

Somebody asks me where you're at

It's been so long since you've called
I'll bet your having a real good time,

Like we were nothin' baby, who you been lovin' lately?

I thought that I could trust the way we made love
You made me feel it was something real
Now everything you've said is lying in our bed
Like shattered glass against my back

Didn't care enough to even say goodbye
I'd give anything now if I could stop thinking about

Days go on like molasses and the nights do too

I said darling it's late, is everything okay?
And the silence took over the road 
Till she said 

I, I just love you 
Don't know why I just do
When are you coming home?
Babe I'm coming home soon 
And I just love you too

Could melt my heart of stone

I turned around and you've almost grown

I whisper I love you in the moonlight at your door
As I walk away, I hear you say

But I won't say yes to him

He has a poet's soul and the heart of a man's man
I know he'll say that he's in love

Maybe I should call you up right out of the blue
Maybe you'll pick up and maybe I'll get through this time

Took my coat and offered me a drink

I sat down on the bed
I looked her in the eye
And said no thanks

As I took the ribbon from her hair

In motel rooms
In the Starbucks line

Between the little white lies
And the cold hard truth
Is everywhere I am

And lonesome dove
And the last pictue show
In a truck stop parking lot
Gasoline rainbow
The burn of the whiskey
Neon smoke
I close my eyes
And you're right there

And gets you to buy her a drink
Love walks you out to the dancefloor
Right when the band starts to sing
Love walks you to a corner booth
Into her life and back through yours
Love walks you out to her car
Right up to her front door

Then love runs through your veins
Like the wax of a candle flame
The first time that she says your name
And you just come undone
Then love runs through her hair
Like your fingers while you stare
Into her eyes thinking she might be the one
When love walks love runs

Love walks you through the calling
The calling up of her old man
Love walks you down the sandy aisle
To put forever on her hand
Love walks you through the highs and lows
Love walks you to your knees
Love walks you over that burning bridge
Between the fights and I’m sorries

Then love runs through your veins
A little less night a little more day
There’s still a fire there’s still a flame
And you know she’s still the one
Then love runs you crazy like
A runaway train that runs your life
Way too fast and reckless like a bullet from a gun
Love walks love runs

One day love turns into war
Says I can’t do this anymore
Then one day love walks out the door
Then love runs fast as it can
After those tail lights for one more chance
Waving your broken heart in your hands
That kind of coming undone

Where the good times roll
And the music's loud
Instead of home starin' holes in the ceiling
I got a feeling

I need a neon church with a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church

Tim McGraw,"Saw your Mama laugh and talkin' on the phone
With a little girl workin' on an ice cream cone
Drippin' on her shoes
And I thought about you

Saw a spring break Honda hell-bent for Daytona
The boys in the back hiding their Corona
Like kids do
And I thought about you

I thought about me
I thought about God
Everything love is
And everything it's not

I thought about songs that make us feel better
I thought about faith that ties it all together
I thought about now, then thought about forever
I thought about fire and how we walked through it
The times I got it right, the times I blew it
I thought about real, I thought about good, I thought about true
And I thought about you

I saw ""hungry"" misspelled on a cardboard sign
And a dirty tee shirt that said ""Roll Tide""
So I gave him a few
And I thought about you

Ran into a buddy, he said ""How long's it been?""
I said ""A couple years,"" he said ""Boy, it's been ten""
That's what time'll do
And I thought about you

I thought about songs that make us feel better

Tim McGuire,"Elijah came to Texas 
To build his family a home 
With his wife and new baby 
And what little goods that they owned 
Had a good yoke of oxen 
And hand tools for clearing the land 
And he built him a church 
'Cause he was a God fearin' man 
All of his children when there 
Worshiped here through the years 
On down to my granddad 
He's buried 'bout 40 yards from here 
It's where I was baptized 
And where I took me a wife 
And if I have my say so 
That's where I'll rest when it's time 

[Chorus:]
When I'm dead and I'm gone 
Won't you carry me home 
To that little white church 
In my daddy's home town 

'Cause Lord knows I'm some kind of sinner 
But I've done come this far 
And it's too late for changin' 
When this race has been run 
Take me back where I came from 
And let me return what I took from the ground 
When this body won't carry me no further 
Take me back 
And lay me down 
This east Texas red dirt 
Won't grow much of nothin' they say 
'Cept tomatoes and peaches 
They mostly drill for oil nowadays 
And a hired hand named Regan 
First made me understand 
And he told me the red was the blood of my kin in the land

Tim McGuire,"Me and Bill there we both come from Georgia 
Met Hank out in New Mexico 
We're bound for Duranqo to join Pancho Villa 
We hear that he's payin' in gold 

I guess a man's got to do what he's best at 
Ain't found nothin' better so far 
Been called mercenaries and men with no country 
Just soldiers in search of a war 

[Chorus:] 
And we're bound for the border 
We're soldiers of fortune 
And we'll fight for no country but we'll die for good pay 
Under the flag of of the greenback dollar 
Or the peso down Mexico way 

When this war is over might go back to Georgia 
And settle down quiet some where 
I'll most likely pack up and head south for Chile 
Heard tell there's some trouble down there

Tim McIlrath,"We request to negotiate
We come to you unarmed
We desire to communicate
You cannot do us harm

They want sacrifice
They hatch schemes and ask me to follow their path to the afterlife

I've got an appetite
For nice things and pipe dreams that my enemies could be blasted by

New metaphors
View that are better for you can't survive if I'm your competitor

Rise together or fight separate wars
I pray I'm never forced to be a predator

Spectres spectate
We wont last
They glad to hate
When gladiators
Breathe their last
Scream en masse
When the dreams do clash
Like the swords in the wars
Let me bleed on that
But they feed on that
Say we need strong backs
Call us weak
If we don't redeem contracts
But the feast wont last
When this beast attacks
The sons and the fathers
Will be free at last

This is love this is not treason

They see sharks in the estuary
They claim the arc's Bartholomew's
They say war is necessary
But we say war is child abuse

We'd rather make our children martyrs than murderers
We'd rather make our children White Flag Warriors

Core-to-core
Were the ones
We've been waiting for
We hold steady
Steadier than stevedores
Not tevias or matadors
On matters of what came before
Forgive the debts
To settle scores
Test the mettle
Either ore
Whats your plan got to do with me
If the bell tolls let freedom ring
And find new ways if we must be King
Instead of leading the young to our suffering

We pass testaments down scream back at heaven
For testing us like Wednesdays at eleven
Wanna recruit and train us to act evilly?
Save it for the shooting range and smack DVDs
Won't study war no more this millennium
It's never again to me or anyone
So think harder when you refer to us
Rather make our children martyrs than murderers

They shell dwellings to quell the shelling
They lift taboos to seduce the cowards
They say we're too yellow-bellied
But we say we're the new superpower

We seek waivers to not be liable
We claim to speak for a higher truth
We stand opposed to the homicidal
We tell you you're fireproof",White Flag Warrior,2010

I know something's shady when I'm feeling it
You play the game like cards when you're dealing it
I see through the eyes of a marked man
But in the streets, you gotta have a game plan
I'm paranoid, I see them coming after me
24/7 on me constantly
I see the red beam, I walk a tight rope
But I know, I'm the target in the scope! Yea!
I try to weed out the real from the fake ones
Two faced ones, won't you keep it real son
I can see it from a mile away
Cause I'm holding it down with my feet on the ground
And they

Evil lurks when you look around
And then you know how it's going down
I look deep and figure how to break free
In my plan, escape from reality
I see you scoping on my life and now he tells me
You look suspicious and your plan is trying to gank me
The main suspect but you're the reject
You'll be the one with the gun, no respect for me

Creep in your area, low right through the residence
Like a sniper, control the damager
Flipping the script, cause I'm two steps ahead of ya

From where I stood the mutual attraction was easy to see
Ten beers and twenty passes later the bar tender said it was time to go
I was outta money, she stood and said honey I'm a-going home on my own.

Oh, I've been there, listen buddy, I've been there
I been there when I thought I was livin' a dream and woke up in a real night mare
Yessum, I've been there, let me tell you I've been there
Anywhere a woman can leave you, man, I've been there.

My baby said honey you need a break
Why don't you take a little fishin' trip
I loaded my my old truck and as I drove away
She waved and kinda blew me a little kiss
A couple days later when I got home
Was nothing left but a note on the door
It said I had to leave you
I need a man who'll stay home a little more.

Let me tell you, I've been there, hey buddy, I've been there
I've been there when I thought I was livin' a dream and woke up in a real night mare

Caught without a ship in this sea of neglect
The one you swore to love is pulling you down
You're in over your head
Chilled to the bone by the waters you've tread
Chart a course to land, before you drown

Swim to the nearest distant shore
There's only so much a heart can endure
You gave it your best, forgive yourself
You can't hold on anymore

It's not as far as it might seem
Now it's time to let go of old dreams
Every heart for itself
Swim to the nearest distant shore

He said for you he'd change
Then he'd let you down and watch you take the blame
You're trapped between his lies and the great unknown
You vowed, you would not fail
But this ain't success, it's a living hell
There's nothing left to lose, you're already alone

Swim to the nearest distant shore
There's only so much a heart can endure
You gave it your best, forgive yourself
You can't hold on anymore

It's not as far as it might seem
Now it's time to let go of old dreams

Swim to the nearest distant shore

Where we all
Soon will be

You've started to believe
The things they say of you
You really do believe
This talk of God is true

And all the good you've done
Will soon be swept away
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say

Listen Jesus
I don't like what I see
All I ask is that you listen to me
And remember
I've been your right hand man all along
You have set them all on fire
They think they've found the new Messiah
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong

I remember when this whole thing began
No talk of God then, we called you a man
And believe me
My admiration for you hasn't died
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied

Nazareth's most famous son
Should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood
He'd have made good
Tables, chairs and oaken chests
Would have suited Jesus best
He'd have caused nobody harm
No one alarm

Listen Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied
Have you forgotten how put down we are?
I am frightened by the crowd
For we are getting much too loud
And they'll crush us if we go too far
If we go too far

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour
All your followers are blind
Too much heaven on their minds
It was beautiful, but now it's sour
Yes it's all gone sour
Ah ah ah ah ah
God Jesus, it's all gone sour

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live

I found a new place to live my life.
It's really no place at all,
Just a hole in the wall, you see.
It's cold and dusty but I let it be,
Livin' here without you,
On Second Avenue.
And since our stars took different paths,
I guess I won't be shavin' in your looking glass.
Guess my old friendly grin,
Must have started to dim, somehow,
And I certainly don't need it now,
Still, I keep smiling through,
On Second Avenue.
I can still see you standing
There on the third-floor landing.
The day you visited we hardly said a word.
Outside it was rainin',
You said you couldn't be stayin,
And you went back to your flowers and your birds.
Since we can no longer see the light
The way we did when we kissed that night,
Then all the things that we felt,
Must eventually melt and fade,
Like the frost on my window pane

Wonderin' if the scenes runnin' in my head will ever slow down
I miss you so

Hold to a dream, carry it up and down
Follow a star, search the world around
Hold to a dream, carry it close to me
I'm frozen in time, you alone can set me free

The rain outside is beatin' down, I'm here at home
And all alone
We used to stay so warm inside, now a night like this
It chills my bones

Hold to a dream, carry it up and down
Follow a star, search the world around
Hold to a dream, carry it close to me
I'm frozen in time, you alone can set me free

I miss you darlin', it's more and more I'm thinkin'
Thinkin' of you
Late at night lyin' in my sleep I'm dreamin'
Dreamin' of you

Tim O'Brien,"There was a time when we?d be the last to leave 
Watching the sun come up while everyone fell asleep 
The music was always loud and I?d smoke and drink too much 
Until I?d fall in your arms and into your lovin? touch 
Now as the years roll by, time has reeled me in 
I?ve slowed down a notch or two from the way things were then 

Those old ways of mine, I?ve left them behind 
Those crazy days are through 
The only thing I still do like I used to do 
Is carry this torch for you 

Remember the days when we?d pack our bags and run 
Chasing a crazy dream into the morning sun 
Now as the twilight falls, I find I?m satisfied 
Watching the fire glow as long as you?re by my side 
Here in my heart it seems, time has passed me by 
I love you as much today as the very first time 

Those old ways of mine, I?ve left them behind 
Those crazy days are through 
The only thing I still do like I used to do 
Is carry this torch for you 

I still want you the way I wanted you then 
If I could do it all over, I?d do it all over again

Tim O'Brien,"Now the stars are fading in the morning light 
And you?re warm beside me in the early bright 
You?re the one I wanted, you?re the one I need 
And I feel so safe here and I feel so free 

I?d like to freeze this moment, I want to take this time 
I want to keep it with me, I want to make it mine 
But why cheat the future, why be afraid 
Cause when you have what I have, you know you got it made 

Chorus 
Like a lone tree standing on a mountain top 
One that keeps on living, one that just can?t stop 
That?s the kind of loving that I have for you 
And when the storm is over, I?ll be there and true 

Many times I?m humbled by the ways of life 
And how a man can stumble onto fate?s sharp knife 
But I?m never worried, no I?m never scared 
When you?re here beside me, I know that I?ll be spared 

Cause you don?t take chances, you don?t like loose talk 
And your ways are constant, you?re a solid rock 
You?re the one I wanted, you?re the one I need 
And you showed me a new life and you helped me to be

The saddest words I ever heard were words of parting

Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long long day
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me

You told me once that you were mine alone forever
And I was yours 'til the end of eternity
But all those vows are broken now and we will never
Be the same except in memory

A sweeter smile and a love more bold and free
But in the end fair weather friends may break your heart dear

Tim O'Brien,"It was over a hundred years ago in eighteen sixty-one
It was in the town of St. Louis that old Stagger Lee was born
Stagger Lee was a gambler and everybody knew his name
He made his living singing high low jack and a game

It was in the month of December on a cold and rainy night
Stagger Lee and Billy Bly got in an awful fight
I was standing on the corner when I heard my bulldog bark
Barking at the two men gambling there in the dark

Chorus:
He was a bad man, talk about a bad man
Such a bad man, mean old Stagger Lee

Stagger Lee and Billy two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw seven and Billy swore he threw eight
Stagger Lee told Billy I can't let you go with that
You took all my money and my brand new Stetson hat

Stagger Lee he turned around and headed down the railroad track
Told Billy you better be gone from here by the time that I get back
Stagger Lee he went on home and he loaded his forty-four
Said I'm going to the bar room to pay a debt I owe

Chorus

Stag went down to the bar room and then stood on the bar room floor
And said nobody move and then he drew his blue steel forty-four
Billy cried oh Stag oh Stag oh please don't take my life
I got two little children and a darling lovin' wife

Stag said bless your children said goddamn your wife
You took my magic Stetson now I'm gonna take your life
Stagger Lee shot the bullet killed Billy oh so fast
Went straight through the heart, then it broke that looking glass

Chorus

I never saw a sight before like the one when the smoke did clear
Billy was lying in a pool of whiskey, diamonds, blood, and beer
Stag had a magic Stetson but I guess it lost its power
Cause they took him to the gallows to await his final hour

Chorus: 
High on a hillside the old church steeple calls 
The bells are a ringin?, a singin? to one and all 
Of the joys and the sorrows the laughter and the pain 
The heartbeat of the whole town is heard within that strain 

It called for my brother when he made his way back home 
With a purple heart in a pine box he was never more to roam 
We all came down to meet him and to make our last goodbyes 
I think of him when the bells ring and the tears come to my eyes 

Chorus 

It called to my sister when she walked the aisle in white 
All eyes were upon her with my father on her right 
He gave her away to my best friend, I can hear the bells today

He got himself a ship and he paid his fare
But God got angry with Jonah down there

God saw the ship and he came in time

And then he went into the deep

Â?My name is Jonah and I came from the king
And all this trouble's on account of me
Why don't you throw me over board and let the ship sail freeÂ?

It's not what I want but it's the best I got
And I don't even know if you're home or not, but I can always try

Long distance, there's a signal comin' from me to you
So insistent, it's penetratin' goin' straight on through
No resistin', I get struck by love at the funniest times
It's long distance love waitin' for me at the end of the line

Got your fiber optics, got your savin' plan
In the off peak hours, honey, I'm your man, I got my callin' card
When I hear you echo off the satellite
I'll be jumpin' up and down, I'll be feelin' alright, I'll be fallin' hard

You'll be puttin' out that cat, turnin' out the lights
While the sun's comin' up here bold and bright
We're on opposite ends of a lonely night, but it's not too far

Long distance, there's a signal comin' from me to you
So insistent, it's penetratin' goin' straight on through
No resistin', I get struck by love at the funniest times

Tim O'Brien,"Whistles don't get lonesome, I guess no one told Hank
You never know that might have been the reason why he drank
What was Willie smokin' when he wrote Â?Hello Walls'
Where'd Bob find that cowtown? Did it really have big balls?
There's no regular combination on that Wabash Cannonball
And I've never known a telephone to ring right off the wall
Patsy didn't fall to pieces on a midnight walk alone
And Â?T' don't stand for Texas since Rose left San Antone

Chorus
Highways don't get lonesome, you're not my sunshine
Memories don't linger in the hallways of my mind
I don't believe that Porter ever saw that Â?Rubber Room'
And I've neer seen a melancholy moon

Elvis hated hound dogs, so is it false or true
No one ever really saw him wearin' blue suede shoes
Was anybody watchin' when Johnny walked the line
And I wonder if it really was the last thing on his mind
If you're minin' coal you'll need more tonnage than sixteen
I can't recall a time when I've been faded as my jeans
You'd have to be a fossil to have a heart of stone
And after Â?Six Days On The Road', his baby wasn't home

Chorus

Â?Blue Moon Of Kentucky' is more like yellow
And I've never seen a melancholy moon

Tim O'Brien,"In a room just like so many
Knives and forks and glasses clatter
He sat behind a microphone
In a corner where it didn't matter
For honest pay an honest player
Sang for tips and vacant stares
On a nowhere night like any other
In a nowhere place where no one cares

She took a seat at an empty table
Looked at the specials on the menu there
She'd been out of love for the longest time
Told her friends she didn't care
But from his list he picked a sad one
Because his heart was empty too
And the song she heard was like an arrow
From Cupid's bow it fairly flew

[Chorus]
And one girl cried to a melody that turned around her soul
One girl cried amazed at how the lyric took it's toll
There beside a little table she thought she was safe alone
But the music hit it's mark when one girl cried

People try to make things happen
They plant a seed to make it grow
They choose a crop to fit the climate
Till the soil into a row
But these two people had it different
More like bees on a flower vine
Instinct told them where to wander
Without a map they made out fine

Remember there's a hundred failures
For every seed that sprouts and grows
It's rare to find the right conditions
These things only nature knows
But miracles are bound to happen
And these two might just pass the test
And get the care and love they need
To carry on for all the rest

[Chorus]",One Girl Cried,1995

I see you standing there
I want to guide you into the light
Show you I really care

It's hard to show the way I feel
On this side of the line
How can I show you my love is real
It you can't see the sign

[Chorus]
A little bit harder, we're gonna have to try
A little bit farther, keep walking side by side
A little bit stronger, we're gonna have to be
A little bit longer, together we hold the key

Why do you hold back when I phone
You never come around
And when I'm with you I feel so alone
You never make a sound

You're playin' the part of the guy all alone up there on the screen

You only wish you had thought of some thing you could do
To ease her mind, instead what you find is her runnin' away

The only thing left is the sound of this house
And me pacin' alone, there's nobody home, and she's runnin' away

Before the weather starts shiftin' and changin' it's ways

We fell so deep in love, nothin' to fear
It came to be our favorite time of year
Now every autumn makes a bittersweet call

My heart starts sinkin' and I turn away
To a picture of you and me there on the wall
I'm missin' you darlin' in the first days of fall

I try to stand tall, to keep up my pride
Hiding the big hole that's deep here inside
I'm a man with no purpose, just walkin' around
Among lovers and children, alone in their crowd

No use in tryin' to plan out my day
It's just gonna end in the same silent way
This time of year it's no use at all

I take it how it comes and how it goes

Above the world of the sea and below the world of the sky
My boat floats in a line between the two
I lost my sense of time when I left the land behind
I don't care which is old or which is new

Life has been this way since the dawn of the first day
No matter what we plan or how we roam
We're passin' through this place each at our different pace
The world is just a journey, it's not our home

And how it takes control, it eats through your body till your dead
It doesn't give a damn, it'll force you down onto your knees

If you cut your hand, would you ignore the pain?
Would you let it bleed and let the blood flow down the drain?
Just ask yourself, would you let life go or take a stand

Oh bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal home

Oh bear my longing heart to him
Who bleed and died for me
Who's blood now cleanses from all sin
And gives me victory

Oh come angel band
Come and around me stand
Oh bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal home
Oh bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal home

I've almost reached my heavenly home
My spirit loudly sings
Behold the holy ones they come
I hear the sound of wings

Come and around me stand
Oh bear me away on your snowy wings

Tim O'Brien,"I had an old hen she had a wooden leg
Best old hen that never laid an egg
Laid more eggs than any hen around the barn
Another drink of whiskey wouldn't do me any harm

[Chorus]
Cluck old hen cluck and sing
Ain't seen an egg since way last Spring
Cluck old hen cluck and squall,
Ain't laid an egg since way last fall

My old hen's a good old hen
She lays eggs for the railroad men
Sometimes one sometimes two
Sometimes enough for the whole damn crew

Next time you cackle you'll cackle in the pot",Cluck Old Hen,1999
Tim O'Brien,"Lady Margaret was standing in her own room door
A comb in her long yellow hair
When who did she spy but Sweet William and his bride
As to the church yard they drew near

The day passed away and night coming on
Most of the men were asleep
Lady Margaret appeared all dressed in white
Standing at his bed feet

She said how do you like your bed
How do you like your sheet
How do you like your fair young bride
That's lying in your arms asleep

He said very well do I like my bed
Much better do I like my sheet
But most of all that fair young girl
That's standing at my bed feet

Then once he kissed her lily white hand
Twice he kissed her cheek
Three times he kissed her cold corpsy lips
Then he fell into her arms asleep

Well the night passed away and the day came on
And into the morning light
Sweet William said I'm troubled in my head
By the dreams that I dreamed last night

Such dreams such dreams as these
I know they mean no good
For I dreamed that my bower was full of red swine
And my bride's bed full of blood

He asked is Lady Margaret in her room
Or is she out in the hall
But Lady Margaret lay in a cold black coffin
With her face turned to the wall

Throw back, throw back those snow white robes
Be they ever so fine
And let me kiss those cold corpsy lips
For I know they'll never kiss mine

Then once he kissed her lily white hand
Twice he kissed her cheek
Three times he kissed her cold corpsy lips
Then he fell into her arms asleep

Tim O'Brien,"Wish I was a mole in the ground
Wish I was a mole in the ground
Mole in the ground, I'd root that mountain down
Wish I was a mole in the ground
Wish I was a lizard in the spring
Wish I was a lizard in the spring
A lizard in the spring, I'd hear my true love sing
If I was a mole in the ground

Don't marry a railroad man
Don't marry a railroad man
A railroad man gonna kill you if he can
And drink up your blood like wine

Baby wants a nine dollar shawl
Baby wants a nine dollar shawl
When I come around the hill with my twenty dollar bill
She says honey where you been so long
Now, baby where you been so long
Honey where you been so long
Said I been to Caroline to see that gal of mine
That's where I been so long
I said, honey where'd you stay last night
Baby where'd you stay last night
Said I stayed around the bend
With some rough and rowdy men
And now I'm goin back again

While travelin through this world below
There's no sickness toil or danger
In the fair land to which I go

I'm goin there to see my mother
I'm goin there no more to roam
I am just goin over Jordan
I am just goin over home

I know dark clouds will hover o'er me
I know my path is rough and steep
But golden fields lie out before me
Where weary eyes no more will weep

I'm goin there to see my brother
I'm goin there no more to roam
I am just goin over Jordan

This form will rest beneath the sod
I'll drop the cross of self denial
And enter in my home with God

It was a bloody knife
I threw her into the river

My father often, he told me
That money would set me free
If I'd but murdered that dear little girl

Now, he stands at his cabin door
Wiping his tear dimmed eye
Gazing on his own dear son

Night is falling.
You have come to journey?s end.

Sleep now, and dream
Of the ones who came before.
They are calling,
From across a distant shore.

Why do you weep?
What are these tears upon your face?
Soon you will see.
All of your fears will pass away.
Safe in my arms,
You?re only sleeping.

What can you see,
On the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?
Across the sea,
A pale moon rises.
The ships have come,
To carry you home.

And dawn will turn,
To silver glass.
A light on the water.
All souls pass.

Hope fades,
Into the world of night.
Through shadows falling,
Out of memory and time.

Don?t say,
""We have come now to the end""
White shores are calling.
You and I will meet again.

Just sleeping.

Tim O'Brien,"John Riley came from Galway town in the years of the Irish hunger
And he sailed away to America when the country was much younger
Now the place was strange and work was scarce
And all he knew was farming
So he followed his other Irish friends to a job in the US Army

Adventure calls and some men run, and this is their sad story
How some get drunk on demon rum and some get drunk on glory

Now they marched down Texas way to the banks of the Rio Grande
They built a fort on the banks above to taunt old Santa Anna
They were treated bad and paid worse, and then the fighting started
And the more they fought the less they thought of the damned old US Army

Adventure calls and some men run, and this is their sad story
How some get drunk on demon rum and some get drunk on glory

Now when the church bells rang on Sunday morn, it set his soul a shiver
He saw the Senoritas washing their hair on the far side of the river
Then John Riley and two hundred more Irish mercenaries
And they cast their lot, right or not, south of the Rio Grande

Adventure calls and some men run, and this is their sad story
How some get drunk on demon rum and some get drunk on glory

How they fought bravely under the flag of the San Patricios
Till the Yankees soldiers beat them down at the battle of Churubusco
Then fifteen men were whipped like mules
On the cheeks they were hot iron branded
Made to dig the graves of fifty more, who a hanging fate had handed

Adventure calls and some men run, and this is their sad story
How some get drunk on demon rum and some get drunk on glory

Now John Riley stands and drinks alone at a bar in Vera Cruz
And he wonders if it matters much if you win or if you lose
""Well, I'm a man who can't go home, I'm a vagabond"", says he

They came a long time before me
Now, we've come on the steamship Atlantic
From our home far across the stormy sea

They said, we would meet on the pier
But the day it is now, almost over
And the darkness and cold, soon draw near

Will they know, their lost little children?

It's been so long since they've seen me

Back in the fall of '49
The sun was sinkin' in the west
When somethin' caught my eye
And through the dim and misty light
I saw the ribbon in your hair
As you turned around I found true love then and there

We never even met that day
Fate kept you and I apart
And though I traveled far and wide
Your vision filled my heart
Through the dark and stormy nights
Deep inside I always knew
I'd find the path that would lead me back to you

Upon the ribbon in your hair

Bathed in love's abiding light

How it feels so right
And may all lovers be like us
And never rest until they find

Tim O'Brien,"Now I make a living from a circuit I made
Out of trial and error and gigs that I've played
It might be the money or the town that it's in
But mostly it's people make you come back again

There was one little place that I played every year
It's outside of Pittsburgh and I guess it's still there
Just a little old Moose lodge, the crowd was okay
But you'd never got rich from the money they'd pay

It's mostly been silent since Rod was around
That place used to ring with a bluegrassy sound
And I'll never forget the way he made me feel
A big man with a bigger heart, named Rod McNeil

You might arrive tired and dark in a gloom
Then he'd buy a big dinner and pay for your room
Pete Rowan would hug him and call him his dad
That day the lonely road didn't seem bad

Well, I saw this and said that I'd buy it for Tim
Didn't I Marty, he'd say with a grin
And I keep that toy fiddle on my window sill
To remind me of Rod and those gray Pittsburgh hills

Tim O'Brien,"A while ago I chanced to roam to the place my great grandad called home
It wasn't that much I saw that day, but I learned I whole lot along the way
I was goin' to Ireland retracing my family footsteps diggin' up roots
You could call 'em tubers

The closer to the root of my family tree, the more people seemed to look like me
Saw a sign said Mollie O'Brien's bar, I knew right then I couldn't be that far
I went in there and asked for beer, he pours this black stuff, he says, 'cheers'
'Guinness gives you strength', he said, I'll tell you friends it's like drinkin' bread
There's a loaf in every pint I was feelin' strong felt like I wanted to sing

My whistle was wet and my tongue was loose
When the barman asked how come I'd choose
To travel such a long, long way on such a cold and rainy day
I said, 'I'm goin' up to Kingscourt town. That's in County Cavan, to look around.
My great grandaddy came from there.
I want to see if the old home place is still there.'
Well he shook his head up and down
And then side to side and then he turned around and said
'A Cavan man then you know, a lot of people wouldn't admit to that'

I figured I'd save a little hassle so I booked a room nearby in a fancy castle
Had a hard time gettin' my dinner there
It was full of these people with light blonde hair
Danish tourists two big busloads of 'em
Now the owner of the place, his hair was black
When I talked to him, I didn't get much back
His people are what you call 'west Brits'
They're the ones that treated my people like dirt
That's what lead to the Irish civil war, I didn't know I'd come back for a little bit more
His nose was way up in the air but he took my money all the same

That night I dreamed I saw the ghost of the one I'd rather have as host
It was Tom O'Brien walkin' round the cabin, there in Kingscourt town in County Cavan
Then the very next day in the hardware store
I found a cousin ten times removed or more
But he was no apparition, he wasn't a haint he was sellin' nuts and bolts and paint
I told him about our family connection, and he kinda stood there still, reflectin'
I could tell he wasn't that much impressed when he asked me with nary a trace of jest
He said, 'How exactly may I help you sir?'
I just bought some nails and got the hell out of there

Then later that day after some detection, I found the lane in the rural section
It matched the picture in my dad's scrap book
And my heart beat faster as I drove to look
The sun burst through the clouds just then as I gazed at the current residents
It was a little sheep dog and an old milk cow
Yeah the old home place is an old barn now
It's ashes to ashes dust to dust thatched roof to tin roof and tin roof to rust",Talkin' Cavan,1999

He courted my dailey, by night and by day

They say I'm not worthy of entering your door

Come sit down here by me as long as you stay
My horses ain't hungry, they won't eat your hay

And a summer sun might burn me til I'm blind

I met little Sadie and I shot her down
Went back home and I got into bed
Forty four smokeless under my head

Woke up the next morning bout half past nine
The hacks and the buggies all standin in line
The gents and the gamblers standing around
Taking little Sadie to her buryin ground

I began to think what a deed I done,
Grabbed my hat and away I run
I made a good run but a little too slow
They overtook me in Jericho

I was standin on the corner readin my bill
When up stepped the sheriff of Thomasville
He said young man ain't your name Browne
Remember the night you shot Sadie down

I said yes sir my name is Lee
I murdered little Sadie in the first degree
First degree and the second degree
If you have any papers won't you read em to me

They took me downtown, dressed me in black
Put me on the train and started me back
Locked me up in that Thomasville jail
I had no money for to go my bail

The judge had the paper in his right hand,
He said forty one days, forty one nights
Forty one years to wear the ball and the stripes

And every bomb will plant some more fear and hate

How many men will choose to run with the mad dog
How many more will have to die at his bloody hand
And who will shield our children from this plague that kills our land

I close my eyes and ears, don't want the news
I will not watch them play the scenes again

Down among the heather

We can lighten up our load

Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time

With nothing but their music, their courage,their names
Our fathers sailed the sea to the west seeking freedom
There never was a king that could keep them in chains

To the land of my fathers, to their own little town

But they ave it up for me and the new life they found

A nineteen fifties chrome and fin and white wall tired montage
Years later it became a church, and they moved an organ in
And these walls would shake with holy songs and sermons against sin

I'll try to be ready when the spirit comes back through
I'll write it down and sort it out and make it fairly rhyme

Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go
And I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold wind blows
That old liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
Well, there she goes my friend, she's rolling now at last

Here the mighty engine roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound, high above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying o'er my home in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
And I'm stuck here on the ground, as cold and drunk as I can be

A place in the garden you sit when you're blue
I sit by your side in the shade of the willow
Your head on my shoulder, my arm around you

While you tell me the one that you love has departed
Leaving you lonely and so broken hearted
And I can't find the words to say how much I love you
How your broken heart is breaking mine too

If I had told you that sweet summer night
We walked in the garden beneath the moonlight
How lovely you are and how I want you so
Would you have listened, now I'll never know

The meadowlark's calling her mate to come nigh
The evening is nearing and the daylight is dying
The soft breeze is sighing a mournful goodbye

While you tell me the one that you love has departed
Leaving you lonely and so broken hearted
I can't find the words to say how much I love you
How your broken heart is breaking mine too
No, I can't find the words to say how much I love you
How your broken heart is breaking mine too

Tim O'Brien,"A farmboy from Kentucky Hills
Learned to play guitar for his backpoarch thrills
Lean a ladderback chair on a windowsill
And look out at the stars
He must have got it up in Michigan
He and his brothers were pickin then
When he moved to Gary he took it with him
That Gibson Hummingbird guitar

Oh how that guitar would ring
Dad would close his eyes and sing
Silver Haired Daddy would always bring a tear to his eyes

I was all of five years old
My brother Don and a kid down the road
We just did what we was told to get outside and play
Someone wrapped it in a coat
And we took it to the swamp just to see if it'd float
But a Hummingbird is not a boat
And it sank straight away

When he got home that's when he heard
What we'd done to that Hummingbird
And he looked at me and never said a word
Just went out back to see

And there it was in all it's mess
With the cattails and the redwing nests
And there he laid it down to rest for all eternity

One of these days you know what I'll do
Get a Hummingbird guitar and a brother or two
Underneath a Kentucky moon, give him back his childhood dream
It won't make up for thirty-two years
And it won't dry up a swamp of tears
But it's better than a case of beer and a fifth of Jim Beam",The Hummingbird,2012
Tim O'Brien,"This is the song that nobody knows
I couldn't begin to describe how it goes
But it makes me cry and laugh right out loud
It's the song I sing when there's no one around

This is the man that nobody sees
He wears my old clothes and he looks just like me
And if he learned how to fly he'd never touch down
It's the man I am when there's no one around

It's four in the morning, I'm lying in bed
With a tape of my failures playing inside my head
The hardknocks and heartaches, things I don't know
I listen and wonder, where will it go?

This is aglimpse of the child within
He's so immature but he's still my best friend
He's just one of the boys who gets lost in a crowd
It's the kid I am when there's no one around

This is the dance I do everyday
I let my soul lead and it takes me away
And it leads my steps to higher ground
It's the dance I do when there's no one around

Will the circle be unbroken

I was standing by my window
On a cold and cloudy day
When I saw that undertaker
For to carry my mother away

Well I told that undertaker
Undertaker please rive slow
For the lady you are hauling
Lord I hate to see that woman go

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by lord by and by
There's a better home awaiting
By and by lord by and by

Well I followed close behind them
I tried to stand up and be brave
But I could not hold back my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by lord by and by
Please tell me there's a better home awaiting
In the sky lord in the sky

I went back home but my home was lonesome
Since my mother, she was gone
All my brothers and sisters crying
Lord what a home so sad and lonesome",When There's No One Around/Will the Circle Be Unbroken,2012
Tim O'Brien,"I'm in some way I'm taking the next train
Don't know what I was thinking
I'm bringing you flowers
I'm making it up to you
Don't know what I was thinking

I figured it out I need you
Don't know why I didn't know it then
I got it all wrong I miss you
Don't know what I was thinking

When it's going along when it's something to give
That's when I feel I have to wonder
Oh, but I was a fool I was listening to everything except 
For what my heart was saying

I figured it out I need you
Don't know why I didn't know it then
I got it all wrong I miss you mmmmm
Don't know what I was thinking

I know what I have said ""it's over""
But I know what I want now, it's you, it's you, it's you

I figured it out I need you

Tim O'Brien,"Well you and I were meant to be 
And in the end I know you'll see 
That we can never be just friends 
Our only love will never end Delilah 

Just think about the way we were 
A perfect set of his n' hers 
Why does a man have to resist 
A never ending happiness Delilah 

I got myself out of the way 
My debt to you is never paid 
I was a fool to let you go 
I'm sorry and I love you so Delilah 

I think about you every day 
And I'm sorry for the things I said 
My perfect love my closest friend 
Oh Delilah 

Well you and I were meant to be 
And in the end I know you'll see 
That we can walk around like friends 
But soon this day will have to end Delilah",Delilah,2014
Tim O'Brien,"Last night I dreamed my head was in fever
Last night I dreamed it never was so far
To reach the shore of safety and redemption
And a gaze upon the bright morning star

I dreamed I was by friends all put abandoned
I dreamed I was alone but for my scars
And blinded by the tears that fell like water
No more to see the bright morning star

The streets of dreams never looked this lonely
The streets of dreams never felt this hard
And I heard my voice barely of a whisper
As the clouds denied the bright morning star

Sometimes this life is no more than a moment
And sometimes this light is lost unto the dark
But courage hears the sound of dawn approaching
And each our own, bright morning star

I woke to find every window open
I woke to find the heavy door jar
And I walked outside and stood upon the hilltop
And gazed one small bright morning star

I walked outside and every bird was singing
As I found again my bright morning star
",Bright Morning Star,2014
Tim O'Brien,"I can tell by the way you're walking
You don't want company 
I'll let you alone and I'll let you walk on 
And in your own good time you'll be 

Back where the sun can find you
Under the wise wishing tree 
And with all of them made we'll lie under the shade
And call it a jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're talking
That the past isn't letting you go 
But there's only so long you can take it all on
And then the wrong's gotta be on its own

And when you're ready to leave it behind you
You'll look back and all that you'll see 
Is the wreckage and rust that you left in the dust
On your way to the jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're listening
That you're still expecting to hear 
Your name being called like a summons to all
Who have failed to account for their doubts and their fears

They can't add up to to much without you
And so if it were up to me, I'd take hold of your hand 
Saying come hear the band
Play your song at the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're searching
For something you can't even name  
That you haven't been able to come to the table
Simply glad that you came

When you feel like this try to imagine
That we're all like frail boats on the sea 
Just scanning the night for that great guiding light
Announcing the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're standing
With your eyes filling with tears 
That it's habit alone that keeps you turning for home
Even though your home is right here

Where the people who love you are gathered
Under the wise wishing tree 
May we all be considered then straight on delivered
Down to the jubilee 

Because to people who love you are waiting
And they'll wait just as long as need be 
When we look back and say those were halcyon days 
We're talking about jubilee",Jubilee,2014
Tim O'Brien,"On a Monday, I was arrested 
On a Tuesday, I was locked up in jail 
On a Wednesday, my trial was attested 
On a Thursday, nobody would go my bail 

Almost done, I'm almost done, almost done 
And I ain't gonna bring them yellow women no pail 

Take these stripes, stripes from around my shoulder 
Take these chains, these chains from around my legs 
Lord, these stripes, it sure don't worry me 
But these chains, these chain's gonna kill me dead 

Yes, I'm almost done, almost done, almost done 
And I ain't gonna bring them yellow women no pail

Tim O'Brien & O'Boys,"The Old Church Steeple (High On A Hillside) 

Chorus: 
High on a hillside the old church steeple calls 
The bells are a ringin?, a singin? to one and all 
Of the joys and the sorrows the laughter and the pain 
The heartbeat of the whole town is heard within that strain 

It called for my brother when he made his way back home 
With a purple heart in a pine box he was never more to roam 
We all came down to meet him and to make our last goodbyes 
I think of him when the bells ring and the tears come to my eyes 

Chorus 

It called to my sister when she walked the aisle in white 
All eyes were upon her with my father on her right 
He gave her away to my best friend, I can hear the bells today 
We?ll meet there to name a new child, and to bless him on his way 

Chorus 

It will call and I?ll answer ?til my ears no longer hear 
It?ll soothe me in anger it?ll wipe out all my fears 
It tells us all that we belong and it swells us up with pride 
We?ll all hear it together and walk there side by side

Tim O'Brien & O'Boys,"Few are chosen, few ever see the light of day
Through the eye of the needle one or two will make their way
We're all searching for the same thing, a little hope one single ray
Few are chosen and few ever see the light of day

Now the night shift is over, another day has come and gone
My old heart starts sinkin' with the coming of the dawn
Seems I'll never catch up to this road I'm traveling on
Now the night shift is over, another day has come and gone

Though the darkness covers me, I know soon the light I'll see
Breaking through the night and shining on my dreams
All my doubts will fade away, I know I'll never lose my way
Though few are chosen and few ever see the light of day

You can lose just so much 'till you start winnin' once again
It makes the odds more even, a lot more even than they've been
So I keep on climbin' out of this hole I find I'm in
And I can see it comin', soon I'll be winnin' once again

I tell you friend this world will test you
It moves so slow, it seems you're standing still
And I won't take no for an answer
There's too much heart behind this iron will

Though the darkness covers me, I know soon the light I'll see
Breaking through the night and shining on my dreams
All my doubts will fade away, I know I'll never lose my way

It?s not as if she never loved me, but times get rough and the rooms get lonely 
And a girl learns fast that there?s a lot of different things called love

It?s a dirty deal but nobody?s to blame 
The odds are good lady luck will be back again

Only thing that's wrong with her

Turned around a time or two

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2004
Tim O’Brien & Darrell Scott ,"In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long long way from home and I miss my loved one so
In the early morning rain with no place to go

Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go
And I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold wind blows
That old liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
Well, there she goes my friend, she's rolling now at last

Here the mighty engine roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound, high above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying o'er my home in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
And I'm stuck here on the ground, as cold and drunk as I can be
You can't jump a jet plane like you can a freight train
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain

Yeah, I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain

For wealth and what it can buy
Don't they know on Judgment Day
Gold and silver gonna melt away?

I'd rather be in a deep, dark grave
And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
Deny my God and doom my soul

What good is gold and silver too
When your heart is not good and true?
Sinner, hear, hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray

Sinner, hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray

Sinner, hear, hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray
