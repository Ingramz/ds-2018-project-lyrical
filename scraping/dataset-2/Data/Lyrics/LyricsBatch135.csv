Depeche Mode,"I was born with the wrong sign
In the wrong house
With the wrong ascendancy
I took the wrong road
That led to the wrong tendencies
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
For the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme
On the wrong day of the wrong week
I used the wrong method with the wrong technique

Wrong

Wrong

There's something wrong with me chemically
Something wrong with me inherently
The wrong mix in the wrong genes
I reached the wrong ends by the wrong means
It was the wrong plan
In the wrong hands
With the wrong theory for the wrong man
The wrong lies, on the wrong vibes
The wrong questions with the wrong replies

Wrong

Wrong

I was marching to the wrong drum
With the wrong scum
Pissing out the wrong energy
Using all the wrong lines
And the wrong signs
With the wrong intensity
I was on the wrong page of the wrong book
With the wrong rendition of the wrong hook
Made the wrong move, every wrong night
With the wrong tune played till it sounded right yeah

Wrong

Wrong

Too long

Wrong

I was born with the wrong sign
In the wrong house
With the wrong ascendancy
I took the wrong road
That led to the wrong tendencies
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
For the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme
On the wrong day of the wrong week
I used the wrong method with the wrong technique

You think you're so special
Think you're so sweet

What are you trying
Don't even tempt me 
Soon you'll be crying
And wishing you dreamt me

You'd be calling out my name
When you need someone to blame

I could corrupt you
It would be easy
Watching you suffer
Girl, it would please me

But I wouldn't touch you 
With my little finger
I know it would crush you 
My memory would linger 

You'd be crying out in pain
Begging me to play my games

I could corrupt you
It would be ugly
They could sedate you
But what good would drugs be

But I wouldn't touch you
Put my hands on your hips
It would be too much to 
Place my lips on your lips

Depeche Mode,"I'm the ghost in your house
Calling your name
My memory lingers
You'll never be the same
I'm the hole in your heart
I'm the stain in your bed
The phantom in your fingers
The voices in your head

One touch is all it took
To draw you in
To leave you hooked
One kiss, you paid the price
You had a taste
Of paradise

Now you're running in circles
Chasing imaginary footsteps
Reaching for shadows
In the bed where I once slept

I'm the ghost in your house
Calling your name
My memory lingers
You'll never be the same
I'm the hole in your heart
I'm the stain in your bed
The phantom in your fingers
The voices in your head

One thought is all it takes
You lose control
You make mistakes
This pain will never leave
Until I die
You'll always grieve

Now you're falling to pieces
Seeing my face wherever you go
Talking to strangers
From a place they'll never know",Ghost [*],2009

You help her forget
The world outside
You're not part of it yet
And if you could drive
You could drive her away
To a happier place
To a happier day
That exists in your mind
And in your smile
She could escape there
Just for a while 
Little fifteen

Little fifteen
Why take the smooth with the rough
When things run smooth
It's already more than enough
She knows your mind
Is not yet in league
With the rest of the world
And its little intrigues
Do you understand
Do you know what she means
As time goes by
And when you've seen what she's seen
You will
Little fifteen

Little fifteen
Why does she have to defend
Her feelings inside
Why pretend
She's not had a life
A life of near misses
Now all that she wants
Is three little wishes
She wants to see with your eyes
She wants to smile with your smile
She wants a nice surprise
Every once in a while
She wants to see with your eyes
She wants to smile with your smile
She wants a nice surprise
Every once in a while

Put him in a elevator
Take him up to the highest high
Take him up to the top where the mountains stop
Let him tell his book of lies

John the Revelator
He's a smooth operator
It's time we cut him down to size
Take him by the hand
And put him on the stand
Let us hear his alibis

By claiming God as his only rock
He's stealing a god from the Israelite
Stealing a god from a Muslim, too
There is only one god through and through

Seven lies, multiplied by seven, multiplied by seven again
Seven angels with seven trumpets
Send them home on the morning train

Depeche Mode,"There's a fragile tension,
That's keeping us going
It may not last forever,
But oh well it's blowing

There's something magical in the air
Something so tragic we had to care

There's a strange obsession,
That's drawing us nearer
We don't understand it
It never gets clearer

There's something mystical in our dreams
So simplistic it kicks and screams

All we will seem to reek on the edge of collapse
Nothing can keep us down

There's a dizzying feeling,
That's keeping us flying
Some glittering gauntlet
Without even trying

There's something radical in our hands
Nothing logical to our plans",Fragile Tension [Peter Bjorn & John Remix],2011

Listen to your spirit sighing
I can feel your desperation
Emotional deprivation

Let yourself go
Let your feelings show

Deep in your imagination
Tune in to the lonely voices
Talking of their only choices

Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let your spirit grow

Step out of your cage and onto the stage
It's time to start playing your part
Freedom awaits
Open the gates
Open your mind
Freedom's a state

I can taste the tears falling
The bitterness that's inside you calling
Yearning for a liberation
Emotional emancipation

Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let your senses overflow

Placed my hands upon the sky

Was following me around
With elevated senses
I can see and taste sound

My heart was serene

I waded into the water
I was bathed, I was drowned

The ghosts that have taken control

You really should have dug a little deeper there

The child inside away

Trickles then picks up the pace
And turns to a river inside
A river that will not subside

And watching from afar I see a child is drowned
The child inside your heart

I can see you drifting away
Heading for the light
I can see you drifting away

On days when the weather was fine

And pull it out and run

Where souls disappear
Only you exist here

Or leave me lying here

And then your tracks lost line
The war times draw your heart away
To west, north, south, east, everywhere
And then they cut you not for fun
Since '61 the wound still runs
To save the political pride
To heat the cold war with you

Berlin, a suburb or the Westworld's eye
I cannot love, cannot deny
You boil too fast til you dry
Anytime you're dry

Now you are bigger than before
But decadence grows in your soul
You spit that oil straight on our head
The clever get rich, the weak ones mad
In streets, in subways goes the race
The others come to find their ways
These countries where they are from
Are poor why are we rich here

You boil too fast til you dry
And I will fly",Berlin,1994
Depressive Age,"Mother got pregnant by rape
Identical twins came to being, but they were different in their minds
The fatal flaw was the bad disposition
Two charactes in black opposition
The birth of the twins started this game
And relieved mother from the shame
So we grew up...

Often I saw you caressing your cat
I devised evil plans, you did not smell a rat
I told you 'bout things you won't understand
Rays of hope are fading, why can't we become friends?
Feel the fascination of obscure ideas
Where is room for love? I want to take and never give

Eclipse and enlightenment since cosmogony
But I'll laugh at your obsequies when you kiss my feet
You made me cry, then you licked off my tears
Nevertheless I will love you, but replaced love with
Vibrations fill our discord, I'm craving for the pleasure
I feel when creatures praise me in agony...and die!

Always before I fall asleep
I sense your presence, Mom, like a good night-kiss
My clown forgot all his jokes, my snowman has melted to tears
When he ripped off my dolls and stuck hails in their furry ears
Permanent pain release, fantastic disharmony
Injustice is put on stage, you and me in one cage
Die fly! Kiss the abyss!
Arise! Who's wise?

You never stayed hungry when you smelt the taste of blood
While I taught the wolves crying and broke black widow's heart
We can live, we can die, but always together, forever apart
Control saves the state, piece falls my hate
No hope still for escape, we follow the cosmic trace
Good and evil
Who wins? The eternal twins!

Ametric destiny, preposterous comedy
Atomal overtones, aesthetic abscess
Immortalized tears, paralyzed fears
Under a spell in condemned cell

Loose or bear the bell
At any rate I'll see you in hell",Eternal Twins,1994
Depressive Age,"Once upon a time on this planet
A sudden cry broke the peaceful silence
As an old man stood on the edge of the world
Staring with tired eyes into the endless sky

There's a secret, and with regret
He looks eastwards, there where the sunrise starts
Since eons the faith lived on, one day they will come from outer space
With an ardent look, he's awaiting them, the ancestors of a lost race

And soon his longing will be rewarded
A giant arrow will tear heaven apart
Unseen creatures coming down
And just mysteries are left for those who came as the next

There's a secret, and with regret
He looks eastwards, there where the sunrise starts

Some centuries later, chaos rules in nature, the old man died long ago
The ancient tradition's wiped out by the arrogance of mankind

One day a flash will point at the grave,
Another old man will go there again
He'll hear the weeping from inside the grave
While they're waiting for a new sign of the strangers

Smash the secrets, feel no regrets
Oh see how nice, this last sunrise

Smash all secrets, feel no regrets

To sell them short good times
More to bring them the grief
You came on all strong to breed your big crime greed
Deep and deeper in me it burns and I cannot deny my eyes
Human pride is on my side
And I shoot with my hateful pride

She's disguised as a new shape

There is a door
The door is open to a floor
A lot of times
A lot of thoughts

And there's a new room filled up with surprises

Lay down your body in mother's air
The wind will drift you anywhere
Lay down your body and feel a bed
But not these thrills to make you really mad
Believe it!
You cannot steer, the wind takes care of you

There is a floor
And doors are wide open to new thoughts
Souls want to know what's out of sight in this palace called life

There's a good smell inside, water will not switch

The line of black boxes march along
Kiss their hands, don't wait to make a try
To touch souls on journey to the sky - goodbye

Talks in things I see, in my fantasy

Yellow snow is in my mouth and in my hand - I sense you, man

She's dry, had no tears to cry, then daylight starts attacks
Against her muddy eyes

'bout the sorrow in her mind

When the spoon is hot and the needle searches for a way
She's turning back to live and to feel like a queen
When the stuff is over and the nightlight sucks the day
She's longing to drift and to push the time away
When the money's over and she sells herself as shame
Her unconscious state remains an psycho circle game

She screams for a scene that she saw herself on the TV-Screen
She was steam, ash grey steam, but now she's going black
And it fades for free
She must sleep, her body's weak but she is powerless

But now a shudder - your voice, stepfather
Is it a deception? - or true affection?

Tough leather slides on her velvety cover, never any other
Except stepfather gets her love
She's thirteen years old
He's got her in a cage of cold

Their sensitive relationship grows to great fears, transformed
To trouble and tears, every day when her head's on his shoulder
This fifty year man seems to be colder
Mother's pain, she wants to reveal what's going on in the family
One day in autumn sister shocked stepfather, me and
My mother when she gave her earthly life an end

His hair is grey, tender his words, he swears on her grave:
""No one will ever separate our love's heat, I'll meet you in heaven
Soon we shall be free"". He trusted in this and in half a year

They're colors to paint my feelings for you
And I know how that there's no way to show you
Just how much I care

And I feel it, oh, so deep within me
And I know that there's so much left to share
All the times you're away, feels just like eternity
As the moments that we had, had to end

The strokes of the brush
Brings me closer to your touch
Through the hues we?ll find a way to follow
I know we will

And the colors are so vibrant like the sun on the ocean
And the hues they will change from day to day
But I know that, that the picture of love would last forever
On this Canvas of our lives that we create
(And our love will last forever)

And I know that always, I saw to try to display
Just how precious that you are to the world
?Cause I know with just a touch, you can show me, oh, so much
That there's more to this life than what we see

The strokes of the brush
Brings me closer to your touch
Through the hues we?ll find a way to follow
I know we will

And the colors are so vibrant like the sun on the ocean
And the hues they will change from day to day
But I know that, that the picture of love would last forever
On this Canvas of our lives that we create
(And our love will last forever)

Colors may fade
Turning vibrant to gray
But one things unchanged
The picture is still the same

And through the days and nights the vision lives on forever
And through a masterpiece of love me made together
We've given all we can, I know the world will understand
The picture is of you and me

And the colors are so vibrant like the sun on the ocean
And the hues they will change from day to day
But I know that, that the picture of love would last forever
On this Canvas of our lives that we create
(And our love will last forever)

Mixed emotions they ramble on inside 
For a false sense of reality 
So I try to escape 
From this place that brings me down 
Cause I feel there's nothing else 
Left inside me anymore

Here in my mind again 
I thought I saw a face in the wake of you 
But now I can't find you anymore 

And I try to erase all these feelings that I have 
Of that happy perfect life

And i have to pretend that you're here for awhile 
But I know that's just a wishful temporary remedy

Though I know it's not like me 
I can not help it, though I try to keep you away 

All this time I thought I knew who you were 
But this time all your words were just lies for demise 
And your thoughts were found unpure

To not work it out or relate 
And get off on the fear that I get when your near 
And the problems that I create

This time, you're in my way 
This time, I will not play the same head trip on me game that you play

Inside something brings me to push

If these visions here they come to me 
To stay or finally go

And I'm caught between two angels and a dream 
One is pulling at my heart while the other rips the scenes 
Caught between two angels and a dream 
And I don't know where to go 

That's a vision of a kingdom 
And its twice is black as night 
They're no brighter than the sun 
With growing rays of light

And somewhere in between 
Is the place that I ignore 
My decision last and win 
And to where I want to go

Caught between two angels and a dream

Find the answers 
I've got to find 
My equilibrium 
I've got to dream 
Within the balance
I've got to keep 
My equilibrium 

Between the black and white 
Between what's wrong and what's right 
It's where I feel myself fall upon 
Between you and me 
Between what's cash and what's free 
And I found where I belong

Maybe you are onto me 
And I wonder if you know 
All the beauty that you give 
Pretending not to see 

And I see you alone sometimes 
And you begin to cry 
And My heart splits wide open 
As I begin to wonder why

I've got to tell you

You're on my mind every place I go.
How much I love you, nobody know.
Yeah, someday babe,
I ain't gonna worry my life any more.

So many days since you went away.
I've had to worry both night and day.
Yeah, but someday babe,
I ain't gonna worry my life any more.

So many nights since you've been gone.
I've been worried, grieving my life alone.
Yeah, but someday babe,
I ain't gonna worry my life any more.

So that's my story and this is all I've got to say to you:
Bye bye, baby, I don't care what you do.
'Cause someday darling,
I won't have to worry my life any more.

Oh lordy lord, oh lordy lord.
It hurts me so bad for us to part.
Oh, but someday baby,
I ain't gonna worry my life any more.",Worried Life Blues,2016
Derek Bailey,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2002
Derek Dressler,"[Chorus]
Bell bottom blues, you made me cry.
I don't want to lose this feeling.
And if I could choose a place to die
It would be in your arms.

Do you wanna see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you wanna hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it because
I don't wanna fade away.
Give me one more day, please.
I don't wanna fade away.
In your heart I want to stay.

It's all wrong, but it's all right.
The way that you treat me baby.
Once I was strong but I lost the fight.
You won't find a better loser.

[Chorus: x2]

Bell bottom blues, don't say goodbye.
I'm sure we're gonna meet again,
And if we do, don't you be surprised
If you find me with another lover.

I don't want to fade away.
Give me one more day please.
I don't want to fade away.

Derek Enright M.P.,"Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door

Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Of a sermon that no one will hear

Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Derek Green,"Every time I see a child without a home of his own
Or a woman struggling to feed her family alone
Or an innocent man found guilty with nowhere to go, who's to blame? 

Who's responsible for making sure the farmer gets his rain?
Why is a victim fighting for each day of his life in vain?
Can a man be guilty when his motives are insane?
Who's to blame?

I wish that everything bad would up and go away
(How can we help?) I wish that I knew how
I wish the love would rain down on me now 

Grace under pressure
That's what we need to survive
Just to stay alive, just to stay alive
Grace under pressure
Just a little grace when the going gets tough, that's enough 

When your mother tells you, your father didn't care
But she never gave you reasons why he was never there
That a wife and a child were not conducing to his plans
Ask who's to blame? 

(What can we do?) I only wish I knew
I wish that everything that's bad would up and go away and leave
(How can we help?) I only wish I could say
I wish that everything that's bad would up and fly, fly away 

Grace under pressure
Fly away
All I need's is a little pressure
All I need's a little grace
Grace under pressure 
When the going gets rough that's enough

Derek Holt,"Twas a hot afternoon, the last day of June
And the sun was a demon
The clouds were afraid, 110 in the shade
And the pavements were steaming

I told Billy Ray in his red Chevrolet
I needed time for some thinking
I was just walkin' by when I looked in her eye
And I swore it was winkin'

She was thirty-one and I was seventeen
I knew nothin' 'bout love, she knew everything
But I sat down beside her on a front porch swing
And wondered what the coming night would bring

The sun closed her eyes as it climbed in the sky
And it started to swelter
Sweat trickled down the front of her gown
And I thought it would melt her

She threw back her hair like I wasn't there
And she sipped on a Julep
Her shoulders were bare and I tried not to stare
When I looked at her two lips

And then she looked at me, I heard her softly say 
I know you're young, you don't know what to do or say
But stay with me until the sun has gone away
And I will chase the boy in you away

And then she smiled and we talked for a while
Then we walked for a mile to the sea
We sat on the sand and a boy took her hand 
But I saw the sunrise as a man

Ten years have gone by since I looked in her eye
But the memory lingers
I go back in my mind to the very first time
And feel the touch of her fingers",Summer (The First Time),

Derek Minor,"I was nine years old when daddy first touched me
At 15 I ran away and never stopped running
I met a man who took me in 'cuz I was pretty though
He said that you could make some money in my video
I get high and drunk just to make it through a show
And act like I'm enjoying it but really this is all a show
I feel degraded, purity obliterated
This is all I know and I really hate it
Mr. Minor are you listening? I know that you're a Christian
And got computer programs to block me from your vision
And every time you watch me you say that I'm the issue
Your pastor preaching about how not to let me catch you slipping
But maybe I'm a victim, maybe I'm just trapped in the system
And next time you pray maybe I might get a mention (please)
Before you talk about me remember that I'm lost
And your secret pleasure coming at a cost

I know you say the answer to my problem is religion

Man I'm on that chronic
Higher than a comet
Sippin' gin and tonic
Drinking till I vomit
Tatted on my arms, tatted on my face
Pants hanging low, nina on my waist
I be slanging soft, plus I got that hard
Die for my hood, ride for my boulevard
I got love for my dogs but never for these girls
It's M.O.E. 'cuz money rule the world
But Mr. Dee-1, I grew up crummy
Saw my pops get killed in front of me
Saw my momma do dope in front of me
Felt like ain't nobody love me
Uniform dirty, dressing bummy
Went to school they called me ugly
Caught the bus they used to jump me
God I just prayed to you Sunday
Now it's Monday, I'm starving
Sip sour milk out of the carton
Talk to myself while I'm out walking should I put myself in a coffin?
I don't know! All I grew up with was trouble
Ain't know no role model, I knew the struggle

Propaganda and banter and all of this empty chatter
And amidst these amens, hallelujahs, and shuckin' jivin'
I see a lot of hypocrites and hyper-criticizing
Mr. Lecrae my momma sold me up the river for some rocks
And daddy told me I was nothing but a problem
Now here you come telling me I'm a low down dirty sinner
And you got the nerve to wonder why I'm in these streets robbin'?
Well go and get batman, and go get back man
I don't need to be judged by you and all of your wack friends
Ain't gluttony a sin? Why you staring at my gin?
Where I'm from we don't pretend
We know we ain't gettin' in
Now the world don't trust me
And these streets done crushed me
Thought you were known for love but you just love to judge me
Truth is, ironically you need me around though
'Cuz otherwise you got nobody else to look down on

Before I crack through the earth's crust

Post up, drink good, and smoke blunts
When I was coming up
They were clapping at ya'll
But nowadays the chopper's givin' applause
See, if the love of money is the root of evil
It's no wonder this culture brainwashing our people
Hey, why else would college graduates parade around as dope boys?
Dumb their whole life down, Oh boy

While she gon' bare it all for a tv show.

Flippin' through a hundred channels, it ain't nuthin' on.

But, if I really want the blessings of the Lord to shine
I need to buy this magic oil for $9.99
So if I put this chicken grease on my fo-head(forehead)
And spin in five circles like you said
You're telling me that mama have no debt
Even though my credit bad and I ain't even got a job yet!
I smell a crook here in the castle, I ain't talking fashion.
To sell hope to broke folk promise 'em all a mansion
To turn God into a genie
And you Aladdin
Makin a fool out of the church while the world laughin'
See you ain't gotta be a Christian to notice this hope's fishy
When the church is like casinos with slot machines missing

And I say ""Just cause my family matters
I can't have my Wins low""
Our Father who are in Heaven who bless this flow
I wanna Stellar, but I'll settle for a Grammy tho.
I want to be a movie star at least give me a cameo
Overlooking all the Lord's done before
Hey, I got everything
My wife a fly dame
Bunch of twitter followers will
Gas me up like octane
I get love in the south
A lot of artists say you're hot man
Plus, the lord saved me

I'ma put it in a balloon and float over all that drama

I see stars shining bright below my feet
You can’t bring me down, no you can’t, you can’t bring me down
So just keep giving me everything I need
You can’t bring me down, no you can’t, you can’t bring me down

(I’m floatin’ so high, you can’t bring me down)

OK now I’m off in this studio
Puttin’ finishin’ touches on all these songs
I’ll probably shoot a video
Unless of course my album budget is all gone
I turn it in to my label, everybody like who
All these fans say that they love it, bought two copies off of Itunes
Then I get a mention on my timeline, with some random blogger review
Said the whole album is garbage, he hate everything that I do
Well what I ain’t know is he insecure, 'cause he used to rap himself 'till,
Life smashed his dreams, now he crush everyone else
And that’s the way that is, even though it ain’t right
He might of bought those problems, but we payin’ the price

Derek Minor,"Used to be off of them boats was Africans in ropes
Now what get off of these boats is pounds of coke
Or sex slaves, ain't it sick?
What you prefer? Take your pick
High schools got armed guards ‘cause teenagers bear arms
And they'll crack your head and put that video on World Star
That boy you callin' a nerd got a bomb off in his backpack
Plan to get revenge and leave a crater where his class at
I saw the sickest thing when Channel 4 News was on
A momma put a two-year-old inside a stove
We look at third worlds and turn up our nose
Got the nerve to tell God we got it on our own

Head cold, so I went to Walgreens
Entered the pharmacy and asked for codeine
Told them I'm a rapper, they laughed and told me to leave
I left with Vitamin C and an itchy throat for weeks
We traded cocaine for mollies, heroin for sizzurp
The devil eatin' the hood, I think America's for dessert
The suburbs love rappers, just come to one of our shows
You'll see Tabitha and Matthew repeating all our flows
While you think she tryna get that tat, but think you wearin' a snapback
‘Cause culture don't discriminate and you just thinkin' it's black rap
The poor tryna survive, we forgot about the ghetto
Now my hood is famous, and Satan is Geppetto

To all the patriots who died in war bloody, every slave
I lift this country to the Lord and in Jesus' name I pray
That the gospel rip our heart, and we turn from wicked ways
I know you gave us this country and they takin' it to date
So listen to me, politician: I'm not talking superstition
It's the fight and the survival of a nation, and we gon' need way more than religion
In a tragedy we run to he who gives us hope and then we get up fixedly
But I pray that we forever let America submit to the King so one day we'll be

Derek Minor,"There's a place where life is everything you dreamed it would be.
There are no problems, or conflict.
And you're always right
Even when you're wrong.
Racism, and class-ism, don't exist.
And birds never poop on your car
Even after you've washed it.
Yes, I know this place,
It's called
Minorville

I woke up in a new Bugatti,
(Turn up!)
Or Honda Accord
I can't tell the difference.
And everybody loved all my opinions,
I did everything right,
Cause that's what it means to be Christian.
Drove 60 in a 45,
The cops ain't even trip.
Guess Obama just cleared my Illuminati membership.
Got mistaken for a doctor,
Instead of a ball player.
And the Pistons drafted Carmelo,
We winnin' it all playa!
No political parties,
The government's fair, right.
It's ILLEGAL for father's not to be in they kids life.
Marriage is a habit,
Women are not objectified.
And rappers tell the TRUTH in they songs instead of lies.
This is a place where there's no black or white churches,
Color could NEVER divide us,
We love each other perfect.
I hope you find what you lookin' for in our city now,
Hey this is Minorville,
Come and take a look around!

Come on
Come take a walk with me.
I'll show you the other side",Lost in Minorville,2013
Derek Minor,"Uh, what up girl, it's been a long time
Since I picked up this pen and told you I'm glad you're mine
Forever together, nothing can separate us too
And if love is scary, baby you my Boo
First time I saw you my homies said I was crazy
My mind is an art gallery, pictured you with my baby
I took your hand as we walked through the sunshine, lady
Said ""get from under that tree, them other dudes are shady""
See I was broke, didn't care about my profit
So that sealed the deal, I looked for rings like signing
You held me down in this love, I swear that I ain't forgot
You deserve diamonds on your finger the size of Ring Pops
And when my shoe was untied, they said the boy was trippin'
She looked past it all, straight patient with him
You a thief girl, you stole my heart
I ain't goin' nowhere till death do us part

See we in love that's strong, what it mean
She independent, but don't mind still calling me king
They say it's old school for you to be my only queen
Well if we primitive, you fly as Pterodactyl wings
Uh, I know I do some things you don't prefer
I'm a chiropractor, get all on your nerves
We get in arguments, sometimes we say some hurtful words
But through that, we see the way that Christ loved the church
I'll protect you girl, your man's loyal
And Lord have mercy on anyone who put they hands on you
We one, and when they hurtin' you they hurtin' me
Never wanna see you cry to me, that's an emergency

So hopefully I'll stop having these nightmares
And if you wanna know what a dream 'bout
It's that one thing you might get

15 years old
Sitting in my bedroom
Watching my baby sister
And praying Mom's will be home soon
Burning my arms
The pressure hit me like typhoons
'Cause I'm the only black kid in my homeroom
I felt the power of words that day
When I was called coon
Sharp as any sword
When they cut, it scar you
You know the pain when people seem to ignore you
I grab the teacher like ""I just want to be heard!""
I went home, and put it all inside a notebook
Poetry is molding me
Look, this how hope look
My father is in Michigan
My step-dad addicted and
My mom's out at working all her fingers to the bone
And I feel like I'm worthless and hurting beneath the surface
It's clear that I am broken Lord,
I just need you in my home
And that day
A dream was born
That in 16 bars
You can hear my pain in this song.

I just want to get these dreams out,
So hopefully I'll stop having these nightmares
And if you wanna know what a dream 'bout
It's that one thing you might get

I see some doctors and lawyers
With a person to cure cancer
And they don't even know it
It's a voice in they dreams, it drowned out
By the loudmouths
Dreamkillers screaming for God to quiet down
So if they say that you are nothin'
Tell em' thank you
'Cause God created this whole universe, that is proof
Meaning, we're expressions of the greatest artist
Brushstrokes of The King's speech, greatest masterpiece
So why you let em' take your purpose? (Huh?)
(It's the dream that he gave you)
Why you believin' that you worthless? (Huh?)
(It's a reason why he made you)
Fly higher, inspire,
You were wired to be The Lord's greatness
Naysayers are liars
And this what He designed me to do
I'm living my dream
You better live yours too.

I just want to get these dreams out,
So hopefully I'll stop having these nightmares
And if you wanna know what a dream 'bout
It's that one thing you might get

I dedicate this to everyone with 116 tatted on their arm
If it ain't inked in your flesh I know it's stitched in your heart
I see an army right in front of me
Black, white and Hispanic, imagine
It's all happened from rapping
Picture that! How God uses foolish things
Like ex-weedheads and d-boys
To speak on His behalf
Can't tell me this ain't the Lord!
We are firm because I see Satan on
A mission for our soul
But Christ told me eat
I see food like Pappadeaux
Crae' doing fine
Tho' people hoping that he stumble'
Hard to get kicked off a mountain
When you fightin' to stay humble
Trip plantin' churches
T-Dot spittin' across the country,
KB going on missions, and Andy shapin' the culture
Now, some might say I'm braggin', but I'm
Just telling you what I see
They won't say about themselves so let me speak!
See, none of us is perfect and we know
But the devil uses that to have us at each others throat
So, for the people who disagree
Or anyone we hurt
Just know our passion's for the body
It's the church!
And tho' we all in different lanes
The focus still the same

I rather let they stories unfold
If you don't mind
I'll like to let you hear some things that they wrote
See how Nathan had leukemia in 2004
Mike's motorcycle crashed and almost everything broke
Brenda had addictions that she fought with her soul
My prayers are the blood of Christ
Keep making them whole
So, for the girl who like to cut herself
I'm hoping you know
That God ain't forgot you
Your pain's what he want
Meaning your overcome is through Alpha, Omega,
And one day I know that this will be all behind us
Trying already to get my crown ready
Hope's the term regardless of what the world tell me
If you believe I hope The Lord keep your faith steady
I know my champions will rise even though the weight's heavy

Derek Minor,"I've soared with the angels
Wish I was flyin' with them right now

But they bend in comparison to You
Lord You, Lord You, Lord
And I can hear you sayin'

Keep your head up, don't look down
We will rise above the clouds
Let go of the world we know
And we won't touch the ground
Keep your head up and don't loose sight
Of the the hope you hold inside
Fix your eyes to the sky
Cuz we were made to

Fly, I know the wind is gettin' crazy now
But don't let turbulence take your desire
You see I'm pointing at you from the ground
Sometimes you need that lift to take you higher

I thank the Lord that I'm in His good graces
All I know is that I'm free and this feeling's so amazing
Everything I've been through, bringing me close to You
The fact that I'm here is proof
What am I without you, without you, you

You better fly (fly, fly, fly)

Just got off a major tour, bet everybody knows his name
Yeah that boy eatin' better, stackin' chips, that's Frito-Lay
You not with Reach no more, so 116 is he okay?
That's the question that they ask me
I shake they hand and smile and say, ""Everything is dandy""
But deep inside sometimes I wish them conversations passed me
And debates about who better, you, Lecrae, or Andy?
Signed this deal, I bet that we can change your life today

They post up on the corner selling crack to your mammie
And if you come up short then boy I might just pop, pop, pop your grannie
Nothing matters but this cheddar mula I'm a shooter
Hit the plug and sell the work call the jeweler cop a mueller
The Streets my kingdom I'm the ruler
Yeah I'm the ruler
Every fiend they worship me
Bow down when you talk to me
I wanna a girl who got no self esteem that I control her
Once so money hungry if I pay her she do what I want
Ok I have them both
That's what you do when your a boss and you got plenty dough
Boy I got plenty dough
I'm riding in a car that's worth more than your life
Speeding through your city

Oh my God
Hey buddy are you ok?
Are you ok?
Somebody call an ambulance

Now have you ever been this high before
Only astronauts can breathe on top of highest floor
That's why they say its astronomical what I afford
If gravity doesn't take your breath, look at my awards
Whose name is on the door
I can take you to Egypt the grass is greener and always sunny
Just put your 401k in my pyramids of money
Now wheres my cappuccino that's why I hired you
Five years ago there's no complaints said I inspired you
This salary pays Sallie Mae wife even admired you
Your kids should thank me I'm the reason their in private school
This ladder had to make you tired
You hope it'll take you higher
But today I change your life
I take that money (You're fired)
I pay that dummy
Go to Vegas that's my craps money
Haha that's funny
Imma sleep good tonight feels so good to have money
I build my own empire you can't take that from me

I been buildin' this foundation for a minute
You ain't gotta be optometrist for you to see my vision
I'm a voice for the voiceless
Like that D boy buildin' his kingdom, brick after brick
That's feelin' that God done lost him and thinking he got no options
Don't know what that life will cost him.
I swear that's some of my family y'all
And you know that I do this for y'all
So you see God the only reason I made it at all
I sit down and hear your heart, like a stethoscope
Then I get up on this mic and tell it for the world to know
Unless the Lord buildin' it, I can guarantee it's broke
That's why I be spittin' with all this passion when you hear my flow

Now I can tell you 'about my new home
Brand new car that's on chrome

It's crazy how times change
Tryna redecorate my life, switched the pictures in my mind frames
Went from hidin' to seekin', trying' to find faith
Now we speak with our feet and our hands, call it sign lang
You age, we get older turn pages
Corners folded, tryna hold on to our place in this maze
See we gave, years of grown' fast pace it's clear to know
Want a direction we would go and that's what we call His grace
And we're still here
No more letters in them bottles, message still clear
Lived our lives for a throttle, tryna fail fair
Ever our foods flash MacDonald's, slow it down
Change up the pitch somethin' like vibrato
But eventually we find this
If you mention all the times that you acted wild and mindless
Rewind it, that's simply just a line that
Minus sign, it change the sum of our lives
Man, this victor is timeless

I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 

I wanna leave somethin' important on this Earth before I die
So many watches I done purchased, but I still ain't buyin' time
You see doubt is like a brain tumor, it torture those alive
So I'm askin' God to please remove this evil from my mind, yeah
I wanna live without these chains on me
So much dirt, I wanna live without these stains on me

To say bye bye to rain and hello to change I'm ready for the summer time

Sorta like [?] I want a new season good times, bad times feelings uneven
Staring out a window day-dreaming, matter of fact I'm leaving, headed for the ocean

Ocean waves, come and take me away
Ocean please, pull me farther to sea
Just stop, breath in, worry's just a deadly sin
Just stop, breath in, worry's just a deadly sin

I'm going, going, back, back to Cali, Cali, you had to see that coming
The son of man said he would carry all my burdens and that's the truth and I ain't worrying 'bout nothing
And you know I packed all my bags now, leaving worries behind now
Headed to life, there's no room on this ride now
I'm alive now and all I've got is your love on my mind now

And a couple of them with Derek and his rapper friends
Canon, B-Coop and not to mention them
But not many other artists that I recommend
Lately I been thinking it was dirty for the culture
Chilling me and stash money dancing in the corner
Twerking out work it out baby feeding over donor

Old boy, G card, I done turned that in though
Said ""H.I."" to permanent, don’t want no rental

Only secret's victorian, never change up your story
I never need to record my feelings, I vindicate
You trippin' on me hard
Somehow you done did it, you came before the squad

All I know is they said that my pops O.D.'d

I feel like You up in the sky and You torturin' me
Even though that that's foolish
You see all the pain that I feel like You pour it on me
I just hope I don't lose it

Tired of feelin' I'm failin' at everything
Cause sometimes it feel like You take away everything
It feel like You've gotta be mad at me
Are You mad at me? Do You hate me?
Are these tribulations just to break me?
Man, this can't be the reason You made me

Lost my sister, lost my aunt, lost my dad
Wife got in a wreck, fractured her spine
Feel like evil is circlin' all that I have
Some people mishandle my business
It won't happen again
That money entrusted was took from me
Blew my support and lost one of my friends
I could care less about all of this music
These numbers, opinions, and all of this fame
Just wanna be who God called me to be
And take care of [?] all in the same
I bend on my knees with these tears in my eyes
And my hands to the sky, I'm prayin' for change
Put me in fire, take all that I have
To the end of my days I'm not cursin' Your name
You're all that I have and You gave up Your Son
That is enough
It's all in Your hands and this weight is too much
I have faith in Your love
So as long as I'm alive, long as I'm alive
I'll trust You forever, forever

Now friend and enemy done dropped to their knees, hail to the Son of God, he drop drop to the King

vanishing memories of things that were said,

Taught by the powers that preach over me
I can hear their empty reason
I wouldn't listen I learnt how to fight
I opened up my mind to treason

But just like the wounded and when it's too late
They'll remember they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now

Derek Sherinian,"And here, my prize, the Black Widow. 
Isn't she lovely? And so deadly. 
Her kiss is fifteen times more poisonous than the rattlesnake. 
And you see her venom is highly neurotoxic 
Which is to say that it attacks the central nervous system 
Causing intense pain
Profuse sweating
Difficulty in breathing
Loss of consciousness
Violent convulsions 
And finally death. 
You know what I think I love the most about her 
Is her inborn need to dominate and possess. 
Such power and dignity, unhampered by sentiment. 
If I may put forward a slice of personal philosophy
I feel that man has ruled this world as a stumbling dimented child-king long enough!
And as his empire crumbles, my precious Black Widow shall rise as his most fitting successor! 

These words he speaks are true
We're all humanary stew
If we don't pledge allegiance to
The Black Widow

The horror that he'll brings
The horror of his sting
The unholiest of kings
The Black Widow

Our minds will be destroyed
And every girl and boy
Will learn to be employed
The Black Widow

Love me
Yes we love me
Love him
Yes we love him
Love me
Yes we love him, oh

He sits upon his throne
And picks at all the bones
Of his husbands and his wives
He's devoured
He stares with a gleam
With a laugh so obscene
and the children and the virgins
He's deflowered

Love me
Yes we love me
Love him
Yes we love him
Love me
Yes we love him, oh

Our thoughts are hot and crazed
Our dreams are webbed in haze
Mindless, senseless daze
The Black Widow

These words he speaks are true
We're all humanary stew
If we don't pledge allegiance to
Ha-ha-ha, the Black Widow

The Black Widow
Sets free, oh, the children to me

Came into the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin’ ‘fore I knew it, and as he grew
He’d say “I’m gonna be like you, Dad
You know I’m gonna be like you.”

“When you comin’ home, Dad?”

He said, “Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let’s play
Can you teach me to throw?” I said, “Not today
I got a lot to do”, he said, “That’s ok.”
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, “I’m gonna be like him, yeah.
You know I’m gonna be like him.”

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
“Son, I’m proud of you. Can you sit for a while?”
He shook his head and said with a smile,
“What I’d really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?”

Well, I’ve long since retired; my son’s moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, “I’d like to see you if you don’t mind.”
He said, “I’d love to, Dad, if I can find the time.
You see, my new job’s a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it’s sure nice talking to you, Dad.
It’s been sure nice talking to you.”

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He’d grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new

Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Derek Webb,"People love you the most for the things you hate.
And hate you for loving the things you can't keep straight.
People judge you on a curve 
And tell you you're getting what you deserve
And this too shall be made right.

Children cannot learn, when children cannot eat
Stack them like lumber when children cannot sleep
Children dream of wishing wells, 
Who's waters quench all the fires of hell
And this too shall be made right.

The earth and the sky and the sea are all holding their breath
Wars and abuses have nature growing with death
You say we're just trying to stay alive
It looks so much more like a way to die.
And this too shall be made right.

Yes there's a time for peace, there is a time for war
There's a time to forgive and a time to settle the score
A time for babies to lose their lives 
A time for hunger and genocide.
And this too shall be made right.

Oh I don't know the sufferings of people outside my front door.
And I join the oppressors of those I choose to ignore.
I'm trading comfort for human life
And that's not just murder, it's suicide.
And this too shall be made right.

O this too shall be made right.",This Too Shall Be Made Right,2007
Derek Webb,"You wanna rock with the cops on the front line
You wanna kick it with the people in the back
You strike a match and you throw back a cocktail
There's got to be a better way

CHORUS:
Cus it is hard to stay
It is hard to wait
To out-love, to out-suffer them

I wanna dream up a world I wanna live in
I wanna spray it on a building downtown
I wanna protest for 
Cus there's got to be a better way

I don't wanna wait
No drugs nor sleep
I wanna hold your hand, really

Baptize this rope
Lie with us in the bed we've made

Derek Webb,"I was killed in a shopping cart
Turned upside-down and left for dead
I saw a cloud try to speak me
As I floated overhead

I found my way to a familiar place
I swear I'd been sometime before
I would've thought it was the marketplace
But I could not find the door

Oh, I have been to heaven
And I have walked the streets
But I couldn't find a hand to hold
To keep my on my feet

So paradise is a parking lot
A spot up front is your reward
And all the rest walk down streets of gold
To the house they could afford

Well I got lost in the swelling crowd
And I could not afford to eat
You only have what you came in with
So I'm living on the streets

Oh, I have been to heaven
And I found no relief
'Cause I couldn't find a hand to hold
To keep my on my feet

Well I heard Jesus Christ was there
He had a car that's bullet-proof
And that way everyone was safe
From the Man who tells the truth

Oh, I have been to heaven
And I have walked the streets
But I couldn't find a hand to hold
To keep my on my feet

Derek Webb,"Now I can buy the proverbial gun
And shoot the proverbial child
When my uncle looks me in the eye
And speaks of freedom
My conscience goes up on trial
In the courtrooms of the mind
Where the judges all have sons
And all the lawyers all were dead
And the backs are all broke
And the bailiff is my brother
And the witness is my sister
And I'm guilty as hell
And by the afternoon I'm out
On the pavement walking
Reeking of salt and blood
No hair upon my head
No shoes upon my feet
Picking your body from my teeth
No stars above me
No stripes upon me

Free (x10)
",The Proverbial Gun,2009
Derek Webb,"Oh, I was free to live and love and kill as I saw fit
I was at peace, I really was, no one I was at war with
The only common good was that we understood that laws unjust were only good for breaking
That difference legalized instead of sameness left nobody free
But that was the day before I married my conscience to the state

My taxes paid these road we laid to places of my choosing
There were no eyes up in the skies looking down into my bed
There was no government without our consent
And keys were made for anyone who just claimed it
And glass was all of every wall that framed it from sea to shining sea
But that was the day before I married my conscience to the state

Right and wrong were written on my heart and not just in the laws that condemned me
But now with Caesar satisfied I can even do the things that should offend me
",The State,2009
Derek Webb,"Talk to me 'cause I've been talking to myself
Help me get these thoughts out of my own head
I don't believe, most days I don't believe

So God bruise the heels we've dug in the ground
That we might move closer to love
Pull out the roots we've dug in so deep

It's so hard to win these fights and love You at the same time
So take my hand 'til grace makes a way to bend
'Til the things I said to ruin only lead to my own end

So God bruise the heels we've dug in the ground
That we might move closer to love
Pull out the roots we've dug in so deep

I'm a show you rap niggas what real talent do
Never shook up, doing with skills not book up
Four-course-meal is what I cook up
Put your notebook up
Niggas swear they're down cuz' they look up
Rip them rhymes up, hook them hooks up
You need a mic check I'm a push them rooks' up
Your crooks suck, I make a deal off of blood money
Make an album off the drug money
Take the label money and launder it under the table money
And open businesses
It don't matter who's the first or who's the first one that finishes
I'm out of nowhere just like Kurt Warner
Did it to the head without a nigga in my corner

""EDO"" keep it hot like a bullet from a burner

(You bring yours I'll bring mine)
Straight up sucka' without a crew with him

If you got skills learn what to do with them
(You bring yours I'll bring mine)
What goes around comes back in town
(You'll get yours in due time)

Do I really have desire to flow
Or desire for dough
By any means play the spotlight or behind the scenes
Fuck rap sell ? and get chased by crack fiends
But remain positive and appeal to black queens
Left and right not too many scenes for inbetweens
We kept it divided I remain undecided
And put it on auto-pilot, lay back and cruise
Till I get enough blues and bad news to blow my fuse
Walk a week in my shoes
Concentrate like the camp on the Jews
We drop jewels, while others blow budgets on bars and booze
We already lost nigga so it's hard for my to lose
And choose without being confused
A lot of funny shit happens but I'm hard to amuse
I was knocking hard in the beginning
Learning to lose is the key to winning
A lot of you all take drastic measures with plastic treasures
How we going to put it down without the cash together
Make it last forever and realize you all been blessed
To hear ED O.G. and Deric Quest on the quest

Yo, I've been in altered states all throughout the states
Blew out the gates, you want wine we got to squash them grapes
Over seas it ain't about the states
I make a hot album, you get a verse on other nigga's tapes
Your first mistake's your worst mistake
Trying to eat and survive off of other nigga's plates
If I'm involved then there must be dialogue
I spits fire dog, to the wire on a level that's higher
Money will turn a saint into a liar
If you ain't got game, you'z a baller in the wind
Niggas rather have a dime up front than a dollar in the end
Silence when you lose but you holla when you win
Big star, close but no cigar
You get smashed on stage like a heavy metal guitar
Whoever you are, or what you sold niggas
You old niggas I don't care what you told niggas
Or who you gased up, you ain't no damn winner

They crossed the Yukon river and they found the bonanza gold
Below that old white mountain
Just a little south-east of Nome
Sam crossed the Majestic mountains to the valleys far below
He talked to his team of huskies
As he mushed on through the snow
With the northen lights a-runnin' wild
In the land of the midnight sun
Yes Sam McCord was a mighty man
In the year of nineteen-one

Where the river is windin' big nuggets they're findin'
North to Alaska go north the rush is on
North to Alaska go north the rush is on

George turns to Sam with his gold in his hand
Said Sam you're lookin' at a lonely lonely man
I'd trade all the gold that's buried in this land
For one small band of gold to place on sweet little Jenny's hand
'Cause a man needs a woman to love him all the time
Remember Sam a true love is so hard to find
I'd build for my Jenny a honeymoon home
Below that old white mountain
Just a little south-east of Nome

Where the river is windin' big nuggets they're findin'

In Heaven to make this earth His home?

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo

Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

(Aight)
We gone ride gray or peanut butter buck eyed
Then we gone tip toe, so slow
We gone wreck the slab for the dirty third coast
Hell we gone post up, on the lot

Fifth drop screens lit, trunk pop
Stash spot, cash box, on vogue socks
Old shoes chrome laces giving haters blues
Banging what Screw, tell me what it do
Shocking and rocking club and the thug and staying true

I'ma do my thug thang, bang bang, chitty, chitty chop
With the stash unlocked, trunks staying hot
HA, green sticky la, deep in the shop
Cardiac kicking times

It's a party baby bounce, bounce sugar hit the flo'
I'm on the cool up in the fo', in the newest Gucci clothes
'Bout to drop it to the door, baguettes touching my navel
Body rocking kinda slutty, served out like label

We got, a stable full of pop
That dish the satellite and throw cable at the spot
Up on the table if it's able to get wet like a mop
And after we wreck the spot we can just ride

Let me see your hands raise, if you playa made

I'ma do it like this, I'ma do it like that
I can hit it from the front

I'ma put it in your crack, see how you act

If you like it on your knees, you could have it for a snack
I'm a fat mack, in a handy bag with a snub with 'em
Broads like the way the fat mack do his thug thizzel
When I hit 'em with my love then I got 'em

I'ma hit it from the top, I'ma put it in a bottle
I'ma hit it from the back, the big black Casanova
I'ma put it in your head and I'ma set it on your shoulders
Syrup in the soda, talking bout the Barre

Foreigner car, feeling like a fallen star
'Bout the menage 'tois ain't that what that Pokey said
Never been scared, South side will leave you dead
And call me Big Meaty, call me Big Meaty

Don't come into my room if you ain't gone get freaky
Working on his boys, run through em like a tractor
Out the South side, Moe-Yo make the god damn adapter
I ain't even quit, I'm doing mighty fast

Sitting on glass, Moe-Yo showing my naked ass
It's the Moe-Yo freestyle I'm so throed
South side playa putting it down, cho-cho
Playas get chosen, like M O E

Put it in your middle yes the big body
Riding big tractor, I'm a money stacker
Out the South side Moe-Yo I'm kinda actor
Act a damn fool, on this damn tape
Like Po-Yo said got them hoes screaming rape

Mine eyes can only look at you, you. 

I used to have a brain, I used to think of many things. 
I watched the falling rain and listened to the sweet birds sing. 
Don't ask me why, little girl. 
I love you and that's all I can say. 
You're ev'ry ,ev'ry breath I take.
You are my nights; my night and day.

Every single word you hear
Is coming from this heart of mine. 
I never felt like this before
A love like yours so young and fine. 
And now as I try to forget you
It doesn't work out any way. 
I loved you such a long time ago
But in my eyes you'll always be. 

Every single word you hear

Derrick Morgan,"This is my last letter dear to you

This is my last letter, baby
I just can't write you anymore
My poor little fingers are swollen
I'm tired of pacin' the floor, yes I am

Threw away our favorite records
It's been tearin' me apart
This is my seventh letter, baby
Just to satisfy my heart

Monday, I wrote and told you
I was all alone and blue
Tuesday, I wrote again, baby
I said I love no one, no one
No one but you, no I don't

Wednesday, I sent you a cable
Beggin' you to call, oh yes, I did
Thursday, I sent you a message
I said oh, darlin', darlin' please come back home

Friday, I woke up cryin'
Wiped the sweat upon a tear
I'll get a long lonely seven
I did the same thing all over again, yes I did

This is my seventh letter, baby
On this bright Sunday mornin'
Just get off my knees from prayin'
I said oh Lord, oh Lord, please send her back home
Can't you hear me talkin' to her?

(This is my last letter to you)
Seven letters, seven days, seven long lonely days
I'll say again
(This is my last letter to you)
Yes it is, yes it is, oh, yes it is

I don't know, on my life
I don't know, on my life
They say, nothing was gained, everything lost all out of heartache
But what I know, look at me now, begging for heartbreak
I don't know, on my life
I don't know, on my life

Yo, nigga check the stacks, check the results
We in your top five by default
I swear to God we're putting UK rap on
Playlists on national radio with a trap song
Respect the fact me and Kone opening some doors
You think they would have put a song like that on there before?
Nah, well I guess we the game changers
A lot of press on this star, we're the game's favourites
My nigga hit me, said that he was in a dark place
But our achievements inspired him, and he can't wait
To be something and chase his dream for real
Just picked my award up in front of Pharrell
Staples Center in L.A., feeling kind of major
Staples in a box, like I'm filing papers
Gonna get a mortgage off of rap, I sad that I'd do it
Now that's what the fuck I call house music
Taking pictures of this money, I'm a pick-pocket
Whip's got a fresh plate, boy I'm dish washing
Young niggas doing well, man that shit ain't often
A black nigga that balled, man that shit ain't common
They thought I'd be a typical black nigga
Making notes out of keys like a bad singer
It could have ended in a grave, so I show my blessings
Or in the can, but that's so depressing
A few of your ratings are still overdue
You still don't hear us? Then we'll grow on you
'Cause we the ones they used to stereotype
Now they play us on radio, we the stereo type
Yeah, nothing better than a proud mum
How man rappers did we outrun?
Bet they didn't think a BET would be the outcome
Wiz Khalifa told us he wants to get on the album
Yeah, shit's so surreal
Labels in the States tryna close a deal
New kids on the block, we the new wave
This good music got me two chains
I say I'm blessed but they're saying that I'm lucky
Selling fast food, I could have ended up a junkie
Look at all the people that we won over
Sex on the couch thinking that I've come so far
Could have chose to sell the green in the blocks fam
And be a green icon, that's a Whatsapp
But nah, nigga I'm just tryna live
All these awards, all that's missing is a BRIT
(Let me, let me break it down)
Money, cars and fame, what you are, a name
People think, start to change
I can try hide it, try fight it
No point, things just aren't the same
The hood just ain't the same
Crime rise, gun wars, bang bang
Might run up on you real quick
Pull it out, won't get a second chance, this ain't a game
Been there, done that, wore the T-shirt
Got the marks, scars from the wars
Tryna gain a name, make a way
Take the game, then charge through the doors
I'ma keep going, keep flowing
Keep showing 'til my arse on the Forbes
From in the hood, little crooks, to Guinness Books
Please start the applause
Please clap for me
I'm the truth, I should work in a factory
MTV lists, number one, we had to be
A mortgage deposit is what they're taxing me
Yeah, I earned this living
Move like I'm Brazilian, German whipping
When it comes to winning awards, you're my son
Because that's over 7-1
It's more than money, this material goals
I'm aware it ain't about these clothes
And that's real, I just hope that you remember me
So I'ma get my foot in the door and leave a legacy

I remember sitting in my classroom
Listening to Wiley and Dizzee Rascal
Breaking all the class rules
Now we've got more trophies than Arsenal
About a thousand on the shoes
Mummy's birthday, I put her on a cruise
Tell me what I've gotta prove
My cousin phoned me, said she saw us on the news
I was really in the street, you can go and phone much
Squeezed the gun off in the car, nearly shot my own foot
Now I'm sitting here thinking 'bout plaques and a Grammy
From me and Bounce testing out the MAC in the alley
How me made it this far's still a mystery
Dropped the mixtape and made history
Tryna do way more than they expect
Heard the top gets lonely, thank God I got Krept
They say it's our time and I don't wanna be late
I think too much cause I just wanna be great
Girls in the hotel and they don't wanna behave (behave!)
What they gonna say?
First headline show sold out in a day
I pray the fame will never change us
Had the whole arena looking like Wrestlemania
Lights everywhere
This summer, yeah we've been on flights everywhere
Egypt to L.A
Then Amsterdam, smoking weed on the stage
All the things we had to overcome
So I treat every chance like it's my only one
So fuck the fake love and the pretenders
""Don't Waste My Time"" got on Eastenders
What can they tell me?
Everywhere I go they want a selfie
I guess that's how it is when you're popular
But watch your back cause snakes ain't only on the Nokia
Sug and Travs got daughter's now
And I'm doing all that shit we used to talk about
When I was young I always dreamed that I would be this
I wish my dad was alive so he could see this

And brighter lights than the kid has ever seen before

And I ain't sure I'll ever have a home

So hold me close tonight, 'cause tomorrow I'll be gone

Tears may fill my eyes when I go
But my heart seems to be
A dream ahead of me

I've thought about us for a long, long time,
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong,
There's something here that doesn't last too long,
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine.
 
Seeing you, or seeing anything as much as I do you,
I take for granted that you're always there,
I take for granted that you just don't care,
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through.
 
It's important to me 
That you know you are free,
'Cause I never want to make you change for me.
Think of me,
You know that I'd be with you if I could
I'll come around to see you once in a while
or if I ever need a reason to smile
And spend the night if you think I should.

Other then the calmness I occasionally blow
Standing there with your feet in the water
As the immense blast takes your over

Do stand here to watch the waves change
Or distinguish what now is an undertow
I am alive
My aqua skies now drag to black

The flower wilt in result
It won't stay for that much longer
But I will not grow any stronger
Do stand here to watch the waves change

Or distinguish what now is an undertow

A tough path we stand there now

And if you fix your bayonet so
And if you kill that man, my friend

And if you do it right

Remember God is always right

It's an illusion, it's an illusion
No you won't believe in it anymore

If I could have the time again

If only time would trickle slow

Like rain that melts the fallen snow

If only lord if only
Oh, I don't believe in it anymore

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

  Try and keep your head up to the sky
  Lovers, they may cause you tears
  Go ahead release your fears

Stand up and be counted
Don't be ashamed to cry

You gotta be

  You gotta be wiser, you gotta be hard
  You gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger

  You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm
  You gotta stay together
  All I know, all I know, love will save the day

Herald what your mother said
Readin' the books your father read
Try to solve the puzzles in your own sweet time

Some may have more cash than you
Others take a different view

Don't ask no questions, it goes on without you
Leaving you behind if you can't stand the pace
The world keeps on spinning 
You can't stop it, if you try to
This time it's danger staring you in the face

Asking for directions to a good time

But the devil said ""girl, stay and play""

He had: warm hands, cold heart
Tryin' to love and tryin' to please
Wit, charm, a head start, almost brought me to my knees
Warm hands, cold heart, trying to love a better day
Almost spirited me away

My will left home, packed its bags and flew away

I was so alone, would have stayed that way a thousand days
I enjoyed his bitter, not his sweetness

He was messin' with my psyche, he was playin' with my mind

But the pleasure in the danger, was so intoxicating

Descendents,"I can't believe what you just said

You'd sell your soul for a dollar bill


I can see the signs in your eyes
The signs that make an honest man lie



You've got green on your mind

Now you've got green in your eyes

Say green is sex, green is power

I think you better go take a shower

Such filthy thoughts



You're seeing green

I'm seeing red



I can't believe what you just said

I heard your song, then I heard your spiel

Music as money has gone to your head
You're seeing green, I'm seeing red



I used to listen and we'd share your love

But now I want to steal your heart

It didn't matter that I had none to give



I've got green on my face
Claim it as mine before the bidding starts



Got jealous green I can taste


And yet I covet what I hateBitter-green bile because you're vile

But I know the road
Can't even see ahead of my nose
But I know the road

I can do it by feel, take it real slow
I know the road
Hold on a fork in the road

Hold on moving too fast
In the wrong direction
Hold on gotta feel the road
Know my position

Over you shoulder, not another look
Burn off the shackles of a wooden past
Melt through the ice, be free at last
Dare to be stupid, dare to smell

You can be crazy, you can be hell

Whichever you choose, you lose you're insane
Granite poured into my veins
Black hole explodes in my brain
The accident is to blame
You say you're going insane
Say it like you mean it, man
I wish I could, but I can't 

You say that life is a pain
It isn't for me, man
I don't feel anything at all
Shield myself from the world
Hold everything inside
Fold my arms across my chest
Shield the world from myself
Make sure the sleeves are tied

Wrap my arms across my chest
Death is my life
Life is my Death
Lay my arms across my chest

On Saint Patty's Day,
I found a lucky penny,
Along the way.
Put in my pocket,
The one with the hole in it.
These days things don't seem to go my way...

I know it it's tough sometimes to be with me,
When I'm predicting rain most everyday.
But lately I've been right, almost every time
These days things don't seem to go my way...

What would I do?
If I hadn't already got lucky once with you?
I hadn't already got lucky once for you?

So I keep tellin' myself something's gonna change.
Maybe I'll get lucky,
Then I can smile again
'Cause that's what I wanna do,
I wanna smile for you
I'm waiting for somethings to go my way...

What would I do,
If I hadn't already got lucky once with you?
If I hadn't already got lucky once with you?

FUCK SAINT PATTY'S DAY!
I'm throwing my pennies away!
But I'm holdin' on,
To a single lucky charm!

That's what I wanna do,
I wanna smile for you,
I'm waiting for somethings to go my way...

What would I do,
If I hadn't already got lucky once with you?
If I hadn't of found you,
What would I do,
If I hadn't already got lucky once with you?
