Zoot Sims,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,2010
Zoot Sims,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you",There is No Greater Love,2010
Zoot Sims,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Zoot Sims,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,2011
Zoot Sims,"You're bound to fall for the bugle call;
You're gonna brag 'bout the Bugle Call Rag.
Thin or fat, young or old;
Shake their shoulders bold.
You're bound to fall for the bugle call;
You're gonna brag 'bout the Bugle Call Rag.
Hold me baby; Let's syncopate to that blue melody;
Just hesitate while a break they take Shh!
While we're dancing please hold me tight; step lively don't lag.
 

",Bugle Call Rag,2012
Zoot Sims,"Love makes me treat you

The way that I do
Gee baby, ain't I good to you

There's nothing in this whole world too good
For a boy so sweet and true
Gee, baby ain't I good to you

Bought you a fur coat for Christmas

Big Cadillac car and everything
What makes me treat you

To brighten up the night, I have you love,
And we can face the music together,

Zoot Sims Quartet,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.

Let's say that our little show is over

Darling, you know I'll let you go
You'd do the same for me
 
I understand
And darling, you are not to blame

I understand
It's not your fault because your heart has changed it's mind
You didn't mean to be unkind
I understand
Forgetting you will be far from easy
I've grown so used to your charms

",I Understand,1953
Zoot Sims Quartet,"Last night I started out happy
Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

Zoot Sims Quartet,"Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you?
And so, all else above,
I'm waiting for the man I love",The Man I Love,1956
Zoot Sims Quartet,"Where the moon swings low
On the Alamo,
In a garden fair where roses grow,
In the tender light
Of a Summer night,
I can see her wander to and fro.

For she said, ""I'll wait
By the garden gate"",
On the night I said, ""I love you so!"",
And in all my dreams it seems I'll go
Where the moon swings low
On the Alamo.

Oh, she said she's gonna wait
Down by the garden gate,

And in all my dreams it seems that I'll go
Where the moon swings low
On the Alamo.",On the Alamo,1960
Zoot Sims Quartet,"I'm goin' home
Down there among the fields of cotton,
Down where the folks have not forgotten me
I feel blue just for a little girl I'm strong for,
Just for a certain one I long to see.
I'm goin' down aroun' my ALABAMY HOME
I'm gonna see the bee that makes the honey comb
The brindle cow will wag her tail,
As I fill up the pail I'll chase the flies and
I surmise she'll moo, ""Thanks to you.
""I'll feed the chicks, and mix some barley with their corn
They love it so, I know they'll cluck for luck each morn
Then I will lie amid the hay
And call it all a day
Way down aroun' my ALABAMY HOME.

",Alabamy Home [Take 9],1973
Zoot Sims Quartet,"Someone told someone and someone told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much
Since everyone spread the story 
With his own little personal touch
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin' till you hear from me

Zoot Sims Quintet,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

The distant moanin' of a train

Zornik,"I open the door see a baby
Blue eyes, filled with a spark
She's wearing her dress and
All I can see is gold

And I see her, I call her, she hears me
And all there is to know
Is hidden from everybody
Except the both of us

It was a good life
You were the king of your mind
Oh so excited
To be a little child again
I feel alright
Tadadadadamdadadam
I feel alright
Tadadadadamdadadam

And there she is playing
And laughing and singing out loud
And as I will gather
I think I might getting older

It was a good life
You were the king of your mind
Oh so excited
To be a little child again
I feel alright

I feel alright

",I Feel Alright,2008
Zornik,"I haven't seen the things you've seen,
I'm rushing to an empty goal,
I lost control

Every minute I remind myself,
There's no way back unless I fall,
I'm fighting my war

Keep me down
Keep me down,
No

What's not I can not help tumble down
But it's too late too soon or now
I lost control

And you push me back up
And I wanna get down
And you push me back up
And I wanna get down on the ground
I wanna get out

Keep me down
Keep me down,
No

And you push me up more and I wanna get down
And you push me up more and I wanna resist
And I push you on the floor but I don't wanna fight
Can we please now stop

Keep me down
Keep me down,
No [2x]



",Keep Me Down,2008
Zornik,"It was a day we both remember
And again I am all the way alone
And I know that these things are never changing
But maybe I'm not so good...
'cause I have to know if I'm right or wrong now
Take my troubles and wash'em down the drain if you can...say
The things are only messed up
But again we are all the way alone
'cause I have to know if I'm right or wrong now
Take my troubles and wash'em down the drain if you can...
Take my hands 'cause I don't know if I am dead
And the love affair was my mistake please come again
All I know is that I messed up
But again I was up in heaven 2
Don't you know that I took those things to love you and just maybe 'cause they're so good
'cause I have to know if I'm right or wrong now
Take my troubles and wash'em down the drain if you can...
Take my hands 'cause I don't know if I am dead
And the love affair was my mistake please come again
Take my hands 'cause I don't know if I am dead
And the love affair was my mistake please come again

A pura guitarra
Zorro viejo con su rock n' roll

Como has cambiado 
Hoy me quieres matar corazón

Aunque sea tan solo un momento

De verdad que hasta el día de hoy 

Duele perder 
Tu carita de niña mimada 
Duele perder 
Esa flor de tu piel en me almohada 
Duele el engaño 
Que a vivir sin tu amor me condena 
Tu risa se va 
Mis lágrimas llegan 

Casi mil horas 
He pasado escuchando a Sabina 
No hay medicina 
Que me ayude a enfrentarme a tu adiós 
Esta costumbre 
De dormirme abrazado a tu cuerpo 
Sé que ni muerto 
Dejará de causarme dolor 

Que 
No diera 
Por que fuera tan solo un mal sueño 
Si pudiera 
Despertar junto a ti bajo el sol 

Duele perder

Zoufris Maracas,"Combien de temps encore devrais-je imaginer
Les lignes de ton corps une à une dandinées
Sur le lit à ressort que je t'avais offert?
Notre amour est bien mort et la note est amère
Et ta mère

Combien de temps encore vas-tu te balancer
Ainsi de corps en corps pour que tu sois lassée?
Du brun, du blond, du roux, du petit, du tassé,
Du long, du grand, du fou, du méchant corsé
Et ta mère, et ta mère

Allez laisse moi rire, allez
Allez laisse moi partir, allez
Allez laisse moi m'envoler
Allez laisse moi fuir je veux tout oublier

Combien de temps encore à te voir revenir
Dans des rêves brumeux imbibés de plaisir?
Exhibant tes amants me proposant maîtresses
Qu'importe le flacon pourvu qu'il y ait l'ivresse
Et ta mère

Combien de temps encore mon esprit tourmenté
Va-t-il me laisser croire que le verbe tromper
Rime avec désespoir, trahison, satiété
Et qu'il n'est pas d'amour sans exclusivité?
Et ta mère

Allez laisse moi rire, allez
Allez laisse moi partir, allez
Allez laisse moi m'envoler
Allez laisse moi fuir je veux tout oublier

Combien de temps encore vas-tu venir chialer
Sur cet amour pourri que tu n'as pas cessé
De pourfendre à la hache tu le voulais mort-né
Seras-tu toujours lâche quand ça devient risqué?
Ou amer

Je ne veux plus te voir, je ne veux plus t'entendre
Je n'veux plus rien savoir, je ne veux plus comprendre
Je ne peux plus te croire, je veux juste t'oublier
Quand tu te fais prendre arrête de crier
Comme ta mère

Allez laisse moi partir, allez
Allez laisse moi m'envoler
Allez laisse moi fuir je veux tout oublier

Où je passais mes illusao
D'un coup je vois passer un fille
Qui me fait perdre la raison

Ah Bahia tudo ba bem, tudo bom
Ah Bahia une fille à chaque saison

Pourtant j'y avais mis les formes
J'l'avais emmené à la maison
J'lui avais fais des trucs énormes
J'lui avais composé une chanson

Ah Bahia tudo ba bem, tudo bom
Ah Bahia une fille à chaque saison

Avant de lui caresser les hanches
J'lui avais fait couler un bain
J'lui avait dit mets toi à l'aise
J'lui avais caressé les seins

Ah Bahia tudo ba bem, tudo bom
Ah Bahia une fille à chaque saison

Et c'est en sortant de la douche
Quand elle s'est approché de moi
Que là j'ai vu un gros truc louche
Lui pousser où il fallait pas

Ah Bahia tudo ba bem, tudo bom
Ah Bahia Ye lui ai dit ya pas moyen

Mais elle a rien voulu savoir 
Elle m'a empoigné des 2 mains
M'a plaqué contre le miroir
Je vous épargnerai la fin

Ah Bahia tudo ba bem, tudo bom
Ah Bahia finalement c'était très bon

Sur une plage de Bahia
Si tu passes tes illusao
D'un coup tu vois passer un fille
Assures toi que c'est pas un garçon

Et si ma foi c'est dans tes cordes
Et puis qu'au fond ça te convient
Qu'les choses soient pas toujours dans l'ordre
N'hésite pas à te faire du bien

Zoufris Maracas,"J’ai plus envie de toi, j’ai plus envie de rien, je n’sais plus comment faire
Car depuis bien longtemps ni tes yeux ni  tes reins ne font plus mon affaire
J’avoue j’ai essayé de prendre un peu sur moi des fois qu’avec le temps 
Il puisse nous arriver de tomber en émoi comme au tout premier temps
Mais il est tant de chose que je connais de toi qu’il serait impossible 
De rester bras ballants souriant face à toi et d’être pris pour cible
Par les vagabondages de ton âme curieuse de connaître le monde 
Car il est à ton âge de ces envies furieuses que les amants abondent
Or si je comprends bien qu’il soit impératif qu’il faille que tu t’envoles
Je ne peux pas sciemment m’attacher au récif attendant que tu immoles
Le reste d’énergie qui pourrait me servir à en trouver une autre
Le reste d’énergie qui devrait te servir à en aimer tant d’autres

J’ai plus envie de toi, j’ai plus envie de rien mais j’ai mal à la gueule 
De voir mes illusions s’évanouir avec toi qui voudrais être seule
 Je n’ose imaginer les raisons qui au fond t’ont fait trancher la poire 
De peur de n’y trouver ultime déception quelque amant dérisoire

J’ai plus envie de rien, j’ai plus envie de toi mais je voudrais te dire 
Qu’il restera toujours graver au fond de moi ce qui m’a fait grandir
Que si pour le moment il faut tout oublier pour aller de l’avant 
Le jour arrivera où je baladerais le long de mes fondements
Ce jour là je le sais je n’aurais plus envie de te voir revenir
Ce jour là je le sais je n’me souviendrais plus que tu m’as fait souffrir
Alors me reviendront la douceur de tes bras les échos de te rires
Et tes blagues à la con une dernière fois m’arracheront un sourire
Alors me reviendront la douceur de tes bras les échos de te rires
Et mon cœur fatigué enfin aura compris qu’ils l’accompagneront jusqu'à c’que de mourir",Bras Ballants,2012

C’est pas pour vous rendre moins con
Mais pour vous dire que vous l’êtes bien
Ça c’est certain, c’est certain

Moi qui vous voit toute la journée
Z’avez pas l’air de rigoler
L’matin vous partez au boulot le soir vous rentrez au tombeau

J’veux pas cracher sur vos p’tites vies
Mais quand même elles m’ont l’air pourries
Z’allez bouffer en grande surface, vous d’vriez savoir qu’c’est dégueulasse

Vous prenez jamais l’temps de rien
Vous d’venez teigneux comme des chiens
Et puis après pour vous calmer vous achetez une nouvelle télé

Croyez qu’ça va vous faire du bien
Les téléfilms américains
La propagande de l’autre teubé, les jeux où on gagne du pognon

Vous avez pas encore compris
Qu’vous en aurez jamais assez
Et c’est ce tant pis de mépris qui vous bouffera jusqu’au trognon

Moi si j’écris des p’tites chansons
C’est pas pour vous rendre moins con
Mais pour vous dire que vous l’êtes bien
Ça c’est certain, c’est certain

Si j’avais voulu l’inventer

Jamais j’serai allé si loin
Ça c’est certain, c’est certain

J’vous fous pas tous dans l’même panier
Vous pourriez pas tous y rentrer
Et moi ça m’filerai le bourdon de voir une telle concentration…constellation…conspiration

La connerie individuelle
Même si parfois elle me dépasse
Ne s’ra jamais aussi cruelle 
Qu’la sacro sainte connerie d’la masse


Celle qui vous fait faire la guerre
Qui nous fait voter pour des cons
Qui dans un r’lan d’instinct grégaire nous fait respecter notre patron

Faut dire quand même qu’cet enfoiré
C’est sur nous qu’il fait son pognon
Il nous la met toute la journée et il faudrait qu’on reste mignon

Et j’vous parle même pas des banquiers
Qui ont dévalisé l’monde entier
Sans que personne lève le p’tit doigt
Moi j’ai pas l’droit au chèque en bois
						Toi t’y as l’droit ?
						Non t’as pas l’droit, toi t’es comme moi, t’as pas d’emploi

Mais que faudra-t-il qu’il nous fasse


Pour qu’au final on réagisse
Si les famines nous laisse de glace, si Serge Dassault protège nos vices

Moi si j’écris des p’tites chansons
C’est pas pour vous rendre moins cons
Mais pour vous dire qu’y a des gens bien
Ça c’est certain, c’est certain

Ils sont deux fois plus nombreux que la bande d’imbéciles heureux
Qui nous emmène tous au carton avec trompettes et clairons

Le problème c’est qu’on s’parle pas
Coincé dans le chacun pour soi
Persuadé qu’on est les seuls à voir qu’on va s’manger la gueule

Alors j’lance ça sans trop y croire
Parce que j’vis d’musique et d’espoir
Mais la vraiment il s’rait grand temps que le bon peuple montre les dents

Qu’on leur explique une fois pour toute
A ces salauds qui servent nos doutes
Qu’on va les jeter en prison
Ça ça va être bon, ça va être bon

Et puisqu’on est là réuni
On a qu’à décider d’un jour
Moi je propos’rais le lundi Pour enfermer tous ces vautours 

Je sais pas où ça nous ménera
Mais ça pourra pas être pire
Que d’laisser à ces scélérats
Le soin d’bousiller notre avenir

Moi si j’écris des p’tites chansons
C’est qu’je sais pas comment vous dire
Qu’une petite révolution nous rendra tous le sourire",Les Cons,2012

Je passe le temps
Qui me passe sous le nez
J'écoute le swing j'picole un peu 
En attendant que ça aille mieux

Mais mes envies sont aussi lisses
Que l'archer qui sur l'violon glisse
Me délivrant de mes tensions
Affranchissant de tous les vices

Je m'en fous je me sens bien
La musique vous va si bien
Quand vous dansez vos émotions
Et oubliez votre condition
D'alcooliques et de gens perdus
Qui déambulent dans la rue
A rêvasser qu'ils sont ailleurs
A attendre qu'il fasse meilleur
Sur la paroi de vos angoisses
Qui m'indiffèrent par ailleurs
L'amour dans ce monde dégueulasse
L'incertitude de l'avenir
Et comme une impression tenace
La sensation qu'il faut partir
Ne pas remettre le pied dans la masse
Du pognon et de la tirelire

Recomptez vos souvenirs
En vérifiant qu'il n'en manque pas
La musique vous fait languir
Celui qui sautera dans vos bras
Celui qui vous fera enfin rire
Vous emmènera au cinéma
Vous proposera de vous enfuir
En vélo jusqu'au Sahara
En vélo jusqu'au Sahara

Un peu de patience Mademoiselle
Celui qui vous coupera les ailes
N'est pas encore prêt de venir
Il a décroché un contrat
Pour assurer votre avenir
Vu qu'il se voit déjà papa
Il veut pour vous faire plaisir
Vous voir en robe d'apparat
Mais il n'a plus le temps de vivre
De vous voir ou de vous sourire
Il est rongé par le travail
Et vous vous n'osez pas lui dire
La profondeur de votre mal être 
Les détails de votre lassitude
Même si ca va de pire en pire
Demain ca ira mieux peut être

Alors à la fin vous dansez
Vos idées noires faîtes valser
Sur un air de swing ravageur
Entretenez le secret espoir
Qu'un soir il rentrera fatigué
Comme frappé par le malheur
Et vous dira m'suis fait viré
Fais tes valises on part ce soir
Et ce jour là vous le suivrez
Vous traverserez la ville
Le monde sera toujours meilleur
S'il faut partir à la dérive
Après tout l'essentiel pour vous
N'est-il pas de vous sentir vivre
A babeloued, à katmandou,
En vélo ou au Sahara
En vélo ou au Sahara

En rade à la dorade
Je passe le temps
Qui me passe sous le nez
J'écoute le swing j'picole un peu

Que j’ai languis

Tous les lundis
Voici enfin venir mon droit
D’rester au lit
Et n’m’occuper que de toi
De tes envies

Un brin de soleil sur ta peau
Un peu de sucre sur ton dos
Pour réveiller mon appétit
Et raviver ma libido
Qui j’avoue s’était endormie
Que j’avais laissé au boulot

A mon réveil tu sois partie ?

L’alcool m’a rendu si idiot

viu o rato, reparou no feijão
se disse ja tenho uma pimenta

num chili com carne
com carne de ratos
acha que a pimenta 'ta tão quente

Sans un bruit de côté, m’a fauché ton auto

Lorsque tu t’es penchée sur mon corps immobile
Qui gisait sur l’asphalte je n’avais plus de sang
Le spectre de la mort qui rodait tout autour se faisait
Menaçant, Mon cœur ne battait plus, et c’est en le
Massant que tu me plus le plus

De même qu’en m’embrassant je ne respirais plus
J’ai pu savoir ton goût
Le goût insignifiant d’une femme de plus
Dont de toute façon je ne verrai le cul

De servir de surin à cette vie de chien
A cette vide de peur, à cette vie de rien

Society turn is back on me.

The grown-ups gave them clever names
Turned them all from very young
On to the drug competition
Feed them T.V. everyday
Teach them just how they should play

Cut them off till they obey

Our little friend was not the type
To want to have to stand and fight
Bully boys all could pick
Upon the lonely little kid
The grown ups all looked hard and long
Said ""He's got two feet he can stand on""
We never like the sickly ones
The boisterous ones are much more fun

He found it hard to socialize
Cause when he laughed or want he cried
In the wrong place he'd be chastised
An idiot to be despised
Never learnt to play the game the way
That your supposed to play
Never learnt the things to say
Or lock emotion safe away

The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears
Sometimes I wish I was asleep
And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I keep dropping those hints but they never touched the ground
I'm useless to you now
You'll have to learn yourself to help yourself

You had never planned on us being so separated
The spiteful words will heal with time
Eventually they rhyme
You can forget but not forgive the fact that I still live
And never wanted you to give... in

Keep on movin'",Keep on Movin',1999
Zuba,"Move, and you will find
Your blood flows, as thick as mine
Its so sad, the way we do the things we do
Makes me mad, knowing the things I done to you

Time and temptation, can really run you down
And all these frustrations, pushing me underground
So if I mind my heart in your presence, will I be free
And if I do the things you say, will you take all of me

[Chorus]
It drives me crazy cause you've got too much to ignore
And I can't see myself on the outside looking in
We've all got troubles yes I know
But if we struggle we can grow
Find myself in your eyes standing in the glow

Standing in your shadow, or lying in the shade of your arms
Masking my expression, another way to not be harmed
Yesterday is fallen, today's on another line
You're running in circles, and I am out of time

[Chorus]",Move,1999
Zube,"It seems totally incredible to me now that everyone spent that evening as though it were just like any other. From the railway station came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance. It all seemed so safe and tranquil.
Next morning a crowd gathered on the common, hypnotized by the unscrewing of the cylinder. Two feet of shining screw projected when suddenly, the lid fell off. Two luminous, disk-like eyes appeared above the rim. A huge rounded bulk, larger than a bear, rose up slowly, glistening like wet leather. Its lipless mouth quivered and slathered, and snakelike tentacles writhed as the clumsy body heaved and pulsated.
A few young men crept closer to the pit. A tall funnel rose and an invisible ray of heat leapt from man to man, and there was a bright glare as each was instantly turned to fire. Every tree and bush became a mass of flames at the touch of this savage, unearthly heat.
People clawed their way off the common, and I ran too. I felt I was being toyed with, that when I was on the very verge of safety this mysterious death would leap after me and strike me down. At last I reached Maybury Hill, and in the dim coolness of my home I wrote an account for my newspaper before I sank into a restless, haunted sleep.
I awoke to alien sounds of hammering from the pit and hurried to the railway station to buy the paper. Around me, the daily routine of life, working eating, sleeping, was continuing serenely as it had for countless years. On Horsell Common, the Martians continued hammering and stirring, sleepless, indefatigable, at work on the machines they were making. Now and again a light like the beam of a warship's searchlight would sweep the common, and the heat ray was ready to follow.
In the afternoon, a company of soldiers came through and deployed along the common to form a cordon.
That evening, there was a violent crash and I realized with horror that my home was within reach of the heat ray.
At dawn, a falling star with a trail of green mist landed with a flash like summer lightning. This was the second cylinder.",Horsell Common and the Heat Ray (Everybody Gather),2006
Zube,"I suddenly noticed the body of a parson lying on the ground in a ruined churchyard
I felt unable to leave him to the mercy of the red weed, and decided to bury him, decently

Nathaniel! Nathaniel!

The parson's eyes flickered open
He was alive!

Nathaniel, I saw the church burst into flame, are you all right?

Don't touch me!

But it's me, Beth! Your wife!

No! You're one of them - a devil!

He's delirious!

Lies! I saw the devil's sign!

What are you saying?

The green flash in the sky
His demons were here all along, in our hearts and souls
Just waiting for a sign from Him
And now they're destroying our world!

But they're not devils, they're Martians

We must leave here!

Look, a house still standing, come Nathaniel, quickly

We took shelter in a cottage, and black smoke spread, hemming us in
Then a fighting machine came across the field
Spraying jets of steam that turned the smoke into thick, black dust

Ulla!

Dear God, help us!

The voice of the Devil is heard in our land!

Listen, do you hear them drawing near
In their search for the sinners?
Feeding on the power of our fear
And the evil within us?
Incarnation of Satan's creation of all that we dread
When the demons arrive those alive would be better off dead!

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for!
And if one man can stand tall
There must be hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Once there was a time when I believed
Without hesitation
That the power of love and truth could conquer all
In the name of salvation
Tell me what kind of weapon is love when it comes to the fight?
And just how much protection is truth against all Satan's might?

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for
And if one man can stand tall
There must be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

People loved you, and trusted you, came to you for help

Didn't I warn them this would happen?
Be on your guard, I said, for the Evil One never rests
I said exorcise the devil!
But no, they wouldn't listen, the demons inside them grew and grew
Until Satan gave his signal and destroyed the world we knew!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Now darkness has descended on our land
And all your prayers cannot save us
Like fools we've let the devil take command
Of the souls that God gave us
To the altar of evil like lambs to the slaughter were led
When the demons arrive the survivors will envy the dead!

There must be something worth living for
(No, there is nothing!)
There must be something worth trying for
(I don't believe it's so!)
Even some things worth dying for
If just one man could stand tall
There would be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Forget about goodness and mercy, they're gone!

Didn't I warn them? Pray, I said! Destroy the devil, I said!
They wouldn't listen! I could have saved the world!
But now it's too late, too late!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Dear God!
A cylinder's landed on the house
And we are underneath it, in the pit!

The Martians spent the night making a new machine
It was a squat, metallic spider with huge, articulated claws
But it, too, had a hood in which a Martian sat
I watched it pursuing some people across a field
It caught them nimbly and tossed them into a great metal basket upon its back

Beth! She's dead! Buried under the rubble Why?
Satan! Why did you take one of your own?

There is a curse on Mankind
We may as well be resigned
To let the devil, the devil take the spirit of man

As time passed in our dark and dusty prison
The Parson wrestled endlessly with his doubts
His outcries invited death for us both - and yet, I pitied him",The Spirit of Man,2006

Zubin Varla,"The Royal Air Force has enjoyed a good days flight
With excellent weather over Iraq
The army has been continuing to prepare
For the coming land battle, and I can report on the arrangements
Being made for handling prisoners of war

O, mistress mine, where are you roaming?
O, stay and hear your true loves coming
That can sing both high and low
Trip no further pretty sweeting
Journeys end in lovers meeting
Every wise man's son doth know

What comes now has gone tomorrow
Present smiles are full of sorrow
But I see you in my mind
From the shadows of my memory
I can feel you walking near me
And I'm waiting for the rain to fall

Dust from your eyes, angels are falling
From distant fears, your cold hearts beating
I can see you in the dark
Or the flicker of a daydream
From the edge of silent tears
I remember and I smile

What is love? Tis not hereafter
Present mirth hath present laughter
What's to come is still unsure
In delay there lies no plenty
Then come kiss me sweet and twenty
Youth's a stuff twill not endure

From the man
You will see
Where we all
Soon will be

Jesus
You've started to believe
The things they say of you
You really do believe
This talk of God is true

And all the good you've done
Will soon be swept away
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say

Listen Jesus
I don't like what I see
All I ask is that you listen to me
And remember
I've been your right hand man all along
You have set them all on fire
They think they've found the new Messiah
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong

I remember when this whole thing began
No talk of God then, we called you a man
And believe me
My admiration for you hasn't died
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied

Nazareth's most famous son
Should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood
He'd have made good
Tables, chairs and oaken chests
Would have suited Jesus best
He'd have caused nobody harm
No one alarm

Listen Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied
Have you forgotten how put down we are?
I am frightened by the crowd
For we are getting much too loud
And they'll crush us if we go too far
If we go too far

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour
All your followers are blind
Too much heaven on their minds
It was beautiful, but now it's sour
Yes it's all gone sour
Ah ah ah ah ah
God Jesus, it's all gone sour

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live

Come on and listen to me

Non saprei forse dire di no.

Trascina I miei pensieri sopra il mare
Col cuore chiuso dentro in una tasca
Cammino in fretta ancora verso te.

Avere freddo per cambiare testa

Di non lasciarsi andare
Tornare a riprovare.

Ma quale amore, e amore?

Ti pago ma non sono pago, o no
E sudo sodo e non godo, neanche un po
Ma fotti prima che ti fottano
Il tuo bel viso, il suo bel viso
Il tuo bel fiore, il suo bel cuore

Amore, e amore?
Ma quale amore, e amore?

Ma questo e un treno che vola
Precipitando si vola
In un oceano di viole, e nel sole

Arzilla e la tua pupilla
E sei vivace, come una che tace
Sono arzillo come un grillo anch'io
E triste come un calzino

Ma stammi vicino, amore
In quanti siamo? E amore?

Ma questo e un treno che vola
Precipitando si vola
In un oceano di viole, e nel sole

Quanto avrei goduto nella vita

Zucchero,"Va pensiero sull'ali dorate
Cross the mountains and fly over the oceans
Reach the land find the place where all children grow
Every night after listening to this lullaby

There you find the heroes alive protecting the innocents
Bless them all 'cause their simple song is so pure and wonderful

Va pensiero sull'ali dorate
Life's beautiful dream carry on for all night long

Lead them your golden wings every feel will fly away
Take them by the hand help them find an easy way
Lead them back to the light back to the light
Where they once used to belong
Where they carry me children as long as they want

Staring at the ceiling
A new day breaks into this room with light
A light that's so revealing

I can't live in shadows
I can't hide in darkened rooms
I can't run forever
That's not the way to heal these wounds

I said, ?No more regrets, no sad songs
Every day will have a truer meaning
No more regrets, no false dawns?
Everything I do I must believe in

I don't know how, how I lost my way
A ship to nowhere sailing
I fell apart, an actor in a play
Whose memory was failing

I can't live on the ocean
Or in the corner of a half-lit stage
I can't turn back the hours
But I can start to find my way

I said, ?No more regrets, no sad songs
Every day will have a truer meaning
No more regrets, no false dawns?
Everything I do I must believe in

The days I've lost, the vanished time
Where nothing mattered
I broke the spell, I turned the tide
The curse was shattered

Papà perchè, perchè papà
Papà perchè, papà perchè
Perchè papà, papà perchè

The lonely hours, the bitter wine
A broken dreamer, I've been released
I've done my time, la bella vita

Every day will have a truer meaning
No more regrets, no false dawns
Everything I do I must believe in

Come on, come on, come on, squeeze
All that your breaking is my heart
Your gonna freeze it, baby you've gone so cold!

Zucchero,"Vuelvo a casa y no sé cómo volver, oh love
Vuelvo a casa y no sé dónde está
He intentado vivir lejos de ti, oh love
Estoy perdido y estoy herido y te estoy oliendo
Y te estoy buscandoY no adivino dónde estás

Cansado de ir contra el viento, vuelve a llover
Lluvia y silencioLa noche y esta soledad
Borran tus pasos y el tiempo
Me borra a mí y borra al mundo

Noche abierta que no se cerrará por ti
Grita fuerte y me guiará tu voz
Di mi nombre y el eco lo traerá, oh love
Estoy herido y estoy perdido y te estoy buscando
Y te estoy oliendo y aún no entiendo dónde estás

Cansado de ir contra el viento, vuelve a llover
Lluvia y silencioLa noche y esta soledad
Borran tus pasos y el tiempo
Me borra a mí y borra al mundo

Confundidos por la carretera
Nuestros aromas perdidos
(Ven que hay un bello olor aquí
Esta noche de puertas, de caricias
Y de estrellas abiertas de noche, de noche)

I need somebody to love
I need somebody to love
I need somebody to love
I need somebody to love

Amor en manos del viento, vuelve a llover
Lluvia y silencioLa noche y esta soledad
Borran tus pasos y el tiempo
Me borra a mí y borra al mundo

I need somebody to love
I need somebody to love
I need somebody to love

Zucchero,"A un passo da Gerusalemme
E a solo un miglio dalla luna
Sotto un cielo di milioni di stelle
Ho il cuore perso in un pianeta lontano
Che gira intorno e cade giù con archi di tristezza

Io muoio per te
Io muoio per te

E se il mio regno diventa sabbia
E cade in fondo al mare
Io muoio per te
Io muoio per te

E dalle fonde oscure valli
Canzoni antiche di tristezza
Ma ogni passo io pensavo a te
Ogni passo solo a te

Per ogni stella un granello di sabbia
Gli avanzi di un asciutto mare
Dimmi quanto tempo, quanto ancora

C'è una città nel deserto e riposa
La vanità di un antico re
Ma la città riposa in pezzi
Dove il vento urla all'avvoltoio

Quello che ha fatto l'uomo
Con l'ambizione è tutto questo
Io farò prigione la mia vita
Se sei la sposa per un altro

Che i miei nemici siano liberi
Io cado e sono qui
Che muoio per te
Io muoio per te

E solo come mai così solo come ora mai
Con tutti i miei domani cosa sono qui
Sono niente così non ci sono vittorie
Nelle nostre storie, senza amor

A un passo da Gerusalemme
E a solo un miglio dalla luna
Sotto un cielo di milioni di stelle
Ho il cuore perso in un pianeta lontano

Che gira intorno e cade giù
Con archi di tristezza
Io muoio per te
Io muoio per te

E anche se hai le chiavi
E distruggi quel che ho
Ogni prigione in polvere
Nemici più non ho

I regni miei di sabbia
Che vanno in fondo al mare
Io muoio per te
Io muoio per te

There you find the heroes alive protecting the innocents
Bless them all 'cause their simple song is so pure and wonderful

Life's beautiful dream carry on for all night long

Lead them your golden wings every feel will fly away
Take them by the hand help them find an easy way
Lead them back to the light back to the light
Where they once used to belong
Where they carry me children as long as they want

Zucchero Fornaciari,"Va pensiero sull'ali dorate
Cross the mountains and fly over the oceans
Reach the land find the place where all children grow
Every night after listening to this lullaby

There you find the heroes alive protecting the innocents
Bless them all 'cause their simple song is so pure and wonderful

Va pensiero sull'ali dorate
Life's beautiful dream carry on for all night long

Lead them your golden wings every feel will fly away
Take them by the hand help them find an easy way
Lead them back to the light back to the light
Where they once used to belong
Where they carry me children as long as they want

Cross the mountains and fly over the oceans
Reach the land find the place where all children grow

Per questo troppo amore, per noi
E questo bel dolore

Che mi illumini il mondo
Buono come te
Che ho bisogno, di qualcosa di vero
Che illumini il cielo

Calare nella sera
Ci vuole un attimo per dirsi addio, spara

Che bella quiete sulle rive

Push me in the fire, as you punish my soul 
I thought it was funny when the hungry would break 
Blew off every miracle I saw as a fake 
Show me something positive, I'll show you its flaw 
Try to preach your ministry, I'll shatter your jaw 
Try bringing the heat, I feel the heat on my face 
Don't you start me off with a taste of the ogre's.

Down trodden and forgotten but its still all good

Denn du warst immer bei mir

Gabst ein Leben lang Freundschaft und nahmst meine Oma zu dir

Lachtest schöner, je tiefer ich schwamm
Mein treuer Begleiter, beim letzten Besuch
Hätte ich dich um ein Haar nicht wieder erkannt
Streifst ziellos durch Schilf, schaust den Kranichen zu
Wo du wandelst vertrocknet das Gras
Du hast zuviel zu tun, auch ein Meister aus Deutschland
Braucht ab und an ein bisschen Spaß
Deshalb trink mit mir, Bruder, trink die tiefschwarze Milch
Trink den Schnaps, trink das Glas leer auf Ex!
Und die ersten Strahlen des Tages
Fallen auf ein weißes und eiskaltes Bett!

Wesen unserer Art, wir tragen geheime Zeichen
Wir gingen aus dem Club, die Vögel singen, ein Auto brennt
Ich steh auf großen Bühnen, du kommst zur Zeit kaum aus dem Bett
Und denkst viel übers Leben nach
Ich fahr mit dir ins Grüne und du bist den Tränen nah
Ich sage: ""Ich mag dich wie du bist!"", du sagst: ""Ja, genau!""
Berührst ein' Baum und schon fällt das Laub
Ich scheiß drauf, was man über dich sagt
Die werden noch lästern, liege ich schon im Sarg
Für dich kämpfe ich alleine gegen alle
Aber erstmal leg ich mich in deine Arme

Wie ich's schaffte, auf alles einen Hass zu bekommen
Wurde groß zwischen Bauern, aber meine Mama meint
„Na dann geh doch in die Stadt wenn's da so cool zu sein scheint”

Ich floh aus dem Dorf, nahm den Nachtbus um zehn
In der Hoffnung die Spastis hier nie mehr zu sehen
Den Dorfkrug, das Volksfest, der Parkplatz, das alles
Tauschte Uwe & Heiko gegen Wilson Gonzales
Und statt Landjugendparties und Fingern im Heuberg
Ins Prince Charles, dem Fußballvereinsheim von Kreuzberg
Die Ronjas von Damals verdreschen ihre Kinder
Die Ronjas von hier schreiben Bücher, über Tinder
Und die Freddies von Damals fressen einen Aal
Die Freddies von hier gehen ins Grill Royal
Ich hass sie alle

Steh zwischen den Stühlen
Und wenn ich mich dann hinsetz und falle
Weiß ich es wieder
Ich hasse alle!

Und wenn ich mich dann hinsetz und falle

Ja, ich hasse alle
Mit der Außenwelt im Krieg
Häng allein in meiner Höhle
Und sing dir davon ein Lied
Nur damit es in der Playlist einer Deutschrap-Party landet
Und schwachsinnige sogenannte Coolkids dazu tanzen
Sich an mich ranwanzen in der ZM-Promophase
Alles liken, kommentieren, die sind sich für nichts zu schade
Adden meine Freunde, lachen über meine Witze
Während ich noch dämlich lächle
Spinn' sie Ihre Netze
Mit klebrigen Fäden und schon bin ich eingesponnen
Und häng als ihre Trophäe zwischen Olsen und Bomber

Weiß ich es wieder
Ich hasse alle!

Ich hasse alle!

Ich floh aus der Stadt, nahm den Nachtbus um 10
In der Hoffnung die Hirnis hier nie mehr zu sehn'
Doch statt Grünkohlromantik und Treiben im See
Ertrag ich alles wenn ich hier bin nur mit einem im Tee
Entfremdet dem Milieu aus dem ich bin
Meine Rückkehr nach Reim führt mich in die Provinz
Dullberts mit Dickarsch und Christenfischsticker
Oder Hängengebliebene Speedbahnhofsticker
Doch zwischen all den alten Freunden mit schütterem Haupt
Ist trotzdem niemand so ein Jockel
Wie Carl Jakob Haupt
Ich hass sie alle! Alle! Alle!

Der Lorbeerkranz, ein neuer Tanz
Schwingt Rhythmus in die Hüften der Stadt
Man sieht und kennt und sagt sich
Was diese Nacht zu sagen hat

Fragt nicht nach neuen alten Werten
Seht weißes Licht, seht nur Gefühl
Die Nacht gehört uns bis zum Morgen
Wir spielen jedes Spiel

Lass diese Reise niemals enden
Das Tun kommt aus dem Sein allein
Allein aus Dimensionen, die
Illusionen und Sensationen lohnen

Give me more, give me more, give me more, give me more, give me more, give me more

Junge Römer - tanzen anders als die anderen
Sie lieben ihre Schwesternliebe lieber als den Rest der Welt
Frag junge Römer - „kennt ihr die Sonne noch?
Sie kennt die Sorgen“
Junge Römer - die Nacht ist jung wie ihr
Vergesst das Morgen

Un ballo nuovo porta ritmo nei fianchi della città
Ci vendiamo, trovimo, chiediamo che cosa si fa
Ma non cercate dei valori, e magari sensazioni
La notte è nostra fino al mattino abbiamo illusion
Non è la fine del viaggio, no, c'è sempre un domani e
Ci sono dimensioni, con illusioni e sensazioni

Give me more, give me more, give me more, give me more, give me more, give me more

Put that on the bible boy, count your blessings

I felt like they tone said ""I'm comin' to get ya""
Well, that's when all of the heavy artillery come in the picture
And luckily cause of your past, you can have someone assist ya
I was raised a cool brother but these motherfuckers went and summoned a nigga!
I swore to never let a man's hands take me to my grave nigga
With my fortune, I'mma get to torchin', like Orkin I spray nigga
I know they dyin' to get it with the N9ne
That's fine, they wanna make a nigga do the woop
So I'mma take the carbine and put it to ya mind
It's goin' through you, not around ya like a hula hoop
Put that on the bible, if ya fuckin' with Tech, get the rifle
Totally trippin', tryna take my title, lift you right up in the sky with the Eiffel
If you psycho, you can do this, if he chooses to be foolish
The gun never loses, never give you the deuces
Nigga, this is Su'Wu biz, ah!
Let me calm my nerves, I'mma simply put this on the word
If ya hella aggravated 'cause of a song ya heard from
The Nina I smoke a nigga like my ganja herb
I'm on the verge, no life beyond the surge
When I bomb, ya served, what does Juan deserve?
But a head stomppin', now put ya teeth on the curb, nigga!?

Aye, fuck all that goin' back and forth with a nigga
Got a problem, what he really wanna do?
If you know like I know, then you know, true
And niggas make songs but they really don't do
What they say, got guns but they really won't shoot
He afraid, I'll lay a nigga down right now
Face to the concrete, nose to the ground
Do him in the streets 'fore his prayers hit the cloud
And the flash and a bang, it is rarely allowed
But a whole body down and a hole in the ground
Dig one for the niggas who be holdin' ya down
Better know I got rounds and they will go around, it's enough
Eat a bullet from the four-pound if ya tough
And then let the choppa spray ya down and get up
Ya pull that off, I'll believe you ain't soft
Otherwise, nigga you just soft as all them other guys
I'll kill ya dead and I put that on my mother eyes
Don't listen to these niggas, they just kick a bunch of lies
How they got a bunch of guns? Shot 'em all a bunch of times
I really do believe Tech got a bunch of nines
Before they gave my nigga Meech a bunch of time
I really know my nigga Young had a bunch of pies
For the low, all my niggas had it for the high
So you believe them niggas out there talking bout they BMF?
They should be them niggas, none of mine
I know Young got it bout what he rap bout
I really pulled Meek Millz out the trap house
Just like I seen Doe B with a OZ
Turn around, two weeks, had a whole ki
Just cause I said as a joke that the dope game dead
Like this, God, a nigga went and showed me
Guess what I'm tryna say is, nigga, I don't know you
And fuck them ol' pussy niggas, I don't want to

And Mr Bing, the moment that it's played
You lead us on the big parade
Altogether now, one and two
Join the happy throng
Everyone start mushing, swinging the Muskrat song
We'll be singing along

Oh, Mr Bing, when you sing, that's the thing we do enjoy

Well, Mr A, when you play, Gabriel say, Who that for?

Make a used door sound like ""Oh dear, Maxwell""

Still --
Huffing and puffing and bluffing
And not on a double to nuttin'.
I doubled up when I f*d yer girlfriend,
Double the trouble, when I doubled they barrel,

Zwan,"""Woe to you, oh Earth and sea, for the Devil sends the Beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the Beast 
For it is a human number, its number is six hundred and sixty six""

I left alone my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind

What did I see can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy

Just what I saw
In my old dreams were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me

'Cause in my dreams 
It's always there 
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair 
Yeah

The night was black was no use holding back
'Cause I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or some kind of hell
Six six six the number of the Beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires burning bright
The ritual has begun Satan's work is done
Six six six the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or some crazy dream
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize me can't avoid their eyes?
Six six six the number of the Beast
Six six six the one for you and me

I'm coming back I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take it's course",Number of the Beast,

the soft pouring rain was just the pouring rain, it wasn't me

we'll suspend the storms and the clouds in sight

of an endless summer
an endless summer

let me go, wasting time
let me go waste my time

once there was a chance that i believed you
a kiss was just a kiss
no matter how i missed you
shine a light on me
say a prayer for the relief

from an endless summer
an endless summer
an endless summer to be home

did we go on too long
did we listen too close
to a youth built strong
with things children shouldn't know

and the fall out from your third degrees
of broken chairs and of pedigrees
where the sons kill sons, and the daughters stay wise
'cause when we rule, everybody dies

in an endless summer

let me go, wasting time
let me go waste my time
let me go, wasting time

No way
You only get it once

I felt a true love
She was everything
I'd ever been dreaming of

But she was bad, I didn't know it
Her pretty smile never did show it
All I knew is what I could see
And I knew I wanted her for me

Took her home to mama
Mama, wanna see my future bride
Well she looked at us both
Then she called me to her side

She said son, take time to know her
It's not an overnight thing
Take time to know her
Please don't go rushin to do your thing

But I didn't listen to my mama
I went straight to the church
I just couldn't wait for that little girl of mine
When I got off from work
The preacher was there
So was my future bride
He looked at us both and he called me to his side

Take time to know her
Not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Don't go rushin to do your thing

But it looks like every thing's gonna turn out all right
But then I came home from work a little early one night
And there she was kissin on another man
Now I know what mama meant when she took me by the hand

She said, take time to know her
Not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Don't go rushin to do your thing

I'm gonna keep on the run,
I'm gonna have me some fun,
If it costs me my very last dime.

If I wind up broke,
Then I'll always remember that I had a swingin' time.
I'm gonna give it everything I've got.

Won't be the fool to your savant

Vision blurry, impaired

Same corner store, same faces in front of it
Same dice game, same forty and same blunt is lit
Same couple of schemes to get a hundred quick
Some niggas is grimy, scheme on who they runnin' with
But see, I was smart, I bought another clip
Never wait to get shot at to shoot, that's some dummy shit
It was just me, no brothers or sis'
No one to tell I'm plummeted to a fuckin' abyss

My grandma still alive and all 11 kids
Only my father made it, let's reminisce another time
Bought a watch with these bars to kill time
Sick in the head, now that's an ill mind
Shine like a d-d-diamond ? young
I said one day I'd have a Lambo, not a Hyundai
I kill for these stacks like Jimmy Caan
Wait let a G win like the Padres
Let a G win like Tony's last name
Who played first base for San Diego
Had to break it down
Fuck the cops, we gotta triumph
Fight for Freddie right now, it's about to be more riots
They wanna kill the youth when they need more guidance
With more violence you can only expect more defiance
It's hard to be vocal when they shoot you up and choke you
Die unexpected if the wrong one approach you
Sharpton ain't doin' enough, where's all the leaders?
Breakin' the same laws, we follow how they teach us
I never seen a thug win a million with Regis
Or a single mother from the ghetto either

Goes by the name of Puerto Rico

The Mike Tyson, Bruce Lee, Stephen Hawking of rhymes
Combined with Einstein's mind and then refined like it's wine
I write divine rhymes, I fill my time by feelin' these dimes
Fill my satisfaction with valid rappin' and Magnum wrappin'
Fact I haven't felt emotions that's potent since daddy's passin'
I'm the Marilyn Manson of ? relax in baths of acid
I got True Religion jeans, if I kill you it's act of passion
I'm a dragon from ?
Aptitude is ample to pass all the rap masters
Who master it, cracking ribs
Put you in the earth, what it's worth you can act natural
The pragmatical mathematical rappin' cannibal
Who fight with animals, Bronx nigga that has an attitude
You see my avenue is compatible with a battle room
I never sold crack, just wrote dope lines to hand to you
Package that, I got the Cadillac of flows
Cataracts these hoes cause I'm soundin' like platinum gold
You never see a ghost, that's what me and my dad was told
So now I'm pickin' up the torch while these labels haggle my soul
Y'all can suck the undercuts of my nuts while I take a shit
Only spend nights, I don't gotta know what patience is
All you niggas bitches, to exist you gotta take my rent
Blow your fuckin' head off clean bro, save the witness

Latino, I'm that and I'm proud
If you don't know us, let me tell you about
Niggas that slam their dominoes loud, let you see copy
Beef copy ox cutter make his cheep choppy
Cherry coco, peña drip 'til your teeth sloppy

Lease a Honda, Chevy on the back block
Runnin' routes with the bow bow in the stash box
When I speak it's chop yaow, I'm a New Yorican
Calderon on the phone, I'm in ? creepin'
Y'all hangin' on resorts to just chill
I'm in the caserios take a walk down the hill
One way in, one way out, where y'all all could get killed
Leave them niggas alone, that's how the officers feel
Nigga, my people, beach, 98 gettin' our tan on
Slippers walkin' on ?, hittin' the sand strong
But plan wrong, it will transform
Wet you then find a Jet Blue out to San Juan
We don't look for parties, the party's wherever we go
Turn the corner section to the 4th of Julio
Too much to fit in one 16
So let me cook like the festival on 1/16
Mean, my career's been like one sick dream
A nightmare, scary how I does this thing
You ain't elite, I'm made of deep
God thought he was stuntin' when he created me
Rap's Bobby Fischer, nigga please take a seat
I made you in three moves: ink, paper, beat
Y'all keep playin', nigga, we play for keeps
Stop claimin' to be what my eyes don't see though
Every verse I spit, you get an 'ay dios mio'

People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share

My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me
Inn her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days
There wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all

And as she walked away and I looked at my wife
And then and there I thankedd the good Lord
For the gifts in my life

Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me
Inn her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days
There wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all

And as she walked away and I looked at my wife
And then and there I thankedd the good Lord
For the gifts in my life

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered...

On the memory of
The dance we shared
'Neath the stars above
For a moment
All the world was right
How could I have known
That you'd ever say goodbye

And now
I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end
The way it all would go
Our lives
Are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss
The dance

Holding you
I held everything
For a moment
Wasn't I a king
But if I'd only known
How the king would fall
Hey who's to say
You know I might have changed it all

And now

#1 Dads,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",The Sound of Silence,1994
