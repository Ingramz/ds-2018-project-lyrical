Trife da God,"Yo, who the fuck brought me this chocolate shit, man?
I said a banana Nutriment, man
Ya'll heard the fuck I said, I gave you
I wrote it on the fuckin' paper, man
Ya'll muthafuckas always fuck around and forgettin' something and shit
Smart dumb niggaz and shit, runnin' around here and shit
Ya'll niggaz need to wisen up, man, yo
Fuck that special ed, shit

I said Big O, hydro-face, pass me the sazone, it's on
There go son, tap out the hash bone
Half moon, he rock, three's fourth quarter length
No jewels, no rocks, it's not worth the spotlight
His gun tool, was a half a hill
That's a six digit slip behind five sticks, eatin' steel, fuck him
We gon' we gon' get our money
If he front, they gon' read about the rocks in his tummy
Mouth was red, socks was bloody, fuck all the talkin'
Safety off and shit, crept out, ""What up money? Freeze!""
Don't move, turn around, act like James Brown
And get down! Get slapped with the put down
Wasn't you the same clown? Uptown, yappin'
I keep big Shirley on my side, so What's Happenin'?
Try eatin' these shells, they non fattening
After you digest gat, I'ma stomp you bastards
So take that, blow, blaow! Ghost, he still breathing
Blow, blow! Anything after that it don't matter
Your homies and your close relatives
Even them nosy ass pigs'll get splattered
It's the T-H-E-O-D-O-R-E 
Send me to Iraq I come back with don heat
Teeth, less than a week, they be callin' me
Keep with the fists, 'cause I sure do cook when it's beef

Yo, what up? Meet, these, O.G.'s, po' thieves and
Baller' shit, long biscuits
Fuck around, take all your shit
Call your bluff, y'all faggots don't want no beef
Grind your teeth, and just, roll with it, don't risk it
Fuck around, and be a statistic (yo, yo)

Niggas ask why I use my glock
'Cause it's 2003, motherfucker, I refuse to box
I'm true to block, strip you for your shoes and socks
Remove your watch, yo I'ma have to lose your top
I'm from a place where chunkheads and zombies dwell
And niggas keep they heat blazin' like Bonzi Wells
Don't ever talk to a nigga like I'm one of your kids
'Cause I'll cock back the mag and pop one in your ribs
So homeboy, keep runnin' your jibs, I'ma run in your crib
Pistol whip you right in front of your wiz
My nigga, that's how it is, I get it, just how I live
'Cause me without a gun, is like Queens without the bridge
Classic cut, this is how a O.G. live
Lamp in village, and still get heard with no spins
This is Trife Diesel, New York's backbone, back home
Black blown, it's Theodore, nigga, fuck your wack stones

Yo, what up? Meet, these, O.G.'s, po' thieves and
Baller' shit, long biscuits
Fuck around, take all your shit
Call your bluff, y'all faggots don't want no beef
Grind your teeth, and just, roll with it, don't risk it
Fuck around, and be a statistic

Yo, what up? Meet, these, O.G.'s, po' thieves and (that's right, it's real!)
Baller' shit, long biscuits (it's that motherfuckin' Theodore shit)
Fuck around, take all your shit (know what I mean? Staten Island, live shit, y'all)
Call your bluff, y'all faggots don't want no beef (straight up and down, nothin' but that cutthroat shit))
Grind your teeth, and just, roll with it, don't risk it
Fuck around, and be a statistic


Blowin' niggas back home, you know what I mean?
I don't give a fuck, we could take it there
Whatever, pence, we got him nigga
Yeah, now I'ma strangle him dead
No doubt, it's real right now, motherfucker
Y'all niggas done done it, fuck y'all yeah
Let me get the fuck outta this fuckin' booth",Biscuits,2014
Trigga,"[Hell Razah]
Yeah, yeah yo
I'm like a whirlwind spinnin wit words of wisdom
In the ghetto only promised a hearse and system
We complete like the solar system
Play your space, I get hungry off of treble and bass and beat breaks
Everyday be a court date recorded on tape
Hell Raizah grab the mic and send your show to a wake
Cut off a snakehead the same way I cut off dead weight
We negotiate wit .38's in a ?nor? face
GZA came wit the Liquid Swords killin you all
I'm the virus in the street that'll get in your paws
See me jumpin outta four-doors wit my road dogs
All you soldiers want wars when you don't know laws
You be a rap fraud, knock you off the top of Billboard
Besides keyboards, only thing I love is the Lord
G-G Maccabee, K-P-P rapidly
Aiyyo Prodical, niggas is charged wit blasphemy

Chorus [Hell Razah]
AND ALL THAT HARD ROCK SHIT (charged wit blasphemy)
AND IF YOU'RE FEELIN LIKE AN ENEMY (come after me)

[Killah Priest]
I heard the sweet words from sour tongues
Vent poison in the ears of the ?grown-z's? dead head for years
Shed a tear for the underwear under the stairs
Left naked in the shame from hunger and fear
Shots were fired in the darkest moments
Niggas missed they targets, hit the homeless when the chrome spit
Sacreligious, days of atonement
Sing a praise wit a peace pipe for niggas I zone wit
Priest I blow bread amongst twelve thugs
Drunk a cup of blood
We trained the same time Peter sprayed a slug
We all trapped in this dream scared to wake up
I seen a phantom whisper, grim shadows, shows a blurry picture
Streets are filled wit goons and bloody niggas
I seen my friend fall, clutchin holdin his stomach
Caught him off-guard, foldin his hundred
It's like a life never ends, never know when it's comin

[Trigga]
Vocal imbalance, a code of silence converses violent
Live from medalion, ?nometry? dealin equality
You could stop to see profiles of me
Mic styles of me, lifestyles of me
Parallel prophecy, three-sixty degree
Complete the formation, salute the salvation
A Wu nation, do the knowledge no hatin
No misbehavin, lyrical affiliation
Artist in occupation together maintainin
Brain stainin, metaphor mutilatin
This generation, a misleading calculation
No elevation, time wastin and live chasin

[Prodigal Sun]
A day and night crime scene, livin in the time machine
Blaze a lime green, six on the spleen over some green
Surrounded by crooks, a life wit jux and bloody heist
It's a deadly price but the gun fiend for ice price
In this hell puzzle filled wit bitches, money and trouble
Stitches, for dummy knuckles crummy fuckin up the hustle
It's a struggle, in jungle wit sin we fondle men
Plus a prison, ain't no division and no religion
And inner city chronicle, thugs get caught up astronomical
Cash phenomenal, blast at your abdominal
Niggas is comical, fuckin wit the abominal
Son, I promise you, you won't live to see tomorrow
Catch a slug in the back of your head at the Apollo
I'm a hard act to follow, rugged Smith like Rollo
(Let's mark that ass nigga)

Chorus 3x

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,

Heard the others want to be dust covered but
Then again the choice is yours.

Where's the trick at here's the trik
And even if you wanted to you can't sound as sick
Watch us swing like this why should we
Swing it like that because in fact what yours
Might hold us back - therefore, I ignore

Back tonight you know what I'm sayin' yo'
Trik I ain't play'n it's easy to roll
With this than to roll with that
With no delay and see an actuality to one
It can not be, I made it look easy because 
It is to me, anytime capacity was filled, tried
To rock it, anytime a honey gave us play, tried
To knock it, never was a fool so I finished
School never seen us sweat, and you never
Seen us schooled, out to rock the world
Right here from my block, don't punch girls
And we don't punch a clock, gotta go gotta
Go see you later by the cat and you can't 
Beat that with a bat

You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
You should get with this cause this is where its at-

Engine engine number nine on that world wide 
Transit line if my train goes off the track
Pick it up pick it up pick it up
Back on the scene, crispy and clean
You can try but don't lie because you can't get with me
We be the outcast, can outlast, and outblast
Let this shit rip and feel the rush, crushed
Open your doors you best believe we're sliding through
Quickly, niftily we can make it hip to be
Down with this mess with two MC's
Fuck what you heard we on some T.O.P.
I'm still DLB

Some hate
Some find nothing in common
Some relate
Some sin
Some are innocent
Some are good
Some are bad
All I want is to understand

All my life I've searched for answers
Why can't I know the reasons we live
Who is this god that we all worship
Or will we ever know

Some think, some drink, some sink into a hole they can't let go
Others bleed for their sins, some draw blood for them ends
Some steel, some deal, some peel off their skin and try to start again
The rest fiend, the rest still dream my heart pumps just to feel that cream
I'm elevated cross faded with a bag of tricks I'm in the mix since 96'
Shoot the facts and relax, we melt on wax, on top of the world is where we at
When I trip I slip, my cons got grip, to the left and to the right shit is tight

Trik Turner,"Can you remember
How you use to jab your fingers into my chest
And tell me how stupid you thought I was
And how I'd grow up to be worthless-
I was only 9 and I can recall every single time-
You raised your hand to me 
No matter how hard I try to forget
I can't erase it from my memory

To this day you seem to think that 
You never did anything wrong
And even though I've tried to look past your
Ignorance
The hate was too strong
And you were to blind to see how much anger
Was growing inside of me
And everything revolved around you
Do what you say
Do what you want
Do as you do
As the years passed
I never knew what was to come
'Cause you were never there
But the day will come
When we'll cross paths
This time I'll be there to let you know that
All I ever wanted was was for you to believe in me
And everyday I prayed for, lived the day for
Was a chance to throw it back in your face-

And before you die, open your eyes
And see, all the different ways that you neglected me
You may have gave me life but you never gave me hope
I don't ever want to take after my own Father

God help me raise up outta this mess 
Stress and grey days and a gang full of tests
God help me, god help me

You put the fear in me and said 
If I wasn't to be everything you expected then a son I'm not in your eye's
And would be instantly rejected-
Your gifts of love were just fifths of pain
While I tried to maintain and refrain 
You just laughed at me, you looked down on me, you threw down on me, 
You made me feel worthless now you're dead to me, how does it feel to be,
What runs through you created me, one day I'll break free
All I ever wanted was for you to believe in me
And everyday I prayed for, lived the day for
Was a chance to throw it back in your face

Is keep my dreams alive
Is that so hard to do?

When you're workin' nine to five,
I've never been born afraid to die,
But I'm afraid to leave behind
The precious life that grows through the sands of time
Cause Now I've got two daughters and I know they need there father
To help them make it through/All the devious things that people do

Cause every moment counts from the good times to the bad
I don't have time to envy those who've got things that I never had
Cause the one thing most important is the thing we take for granted
Until your life is on that line/I think that's the way God had planned it
So open up your eyes/To make you realize/ that there's some/ Life is money
But what is money without life? Cause all I need
Is the air that I breathe and my friends and family

We cry the same tears/We have the same fears
We pass the same gears
We see the same stars
We live the same sky
We pass the same time
We all live and die

'Cause friends, family will stick in the blood
And if you've never felt love than I pray for you cause
Cause life's full of brothas
Seven forty sevens
Who will love us
Before they go to heaven

And everything in-between has a meaning
Some stay connected
While others keep dreaming

Looking for that meaning
But the lost can't be found
Drop to your calves and break 
Can you hear the sound?

Do you feel it?
And do you feel it coming?

Electrical currents
Conflict with the spirits
Ah do you hear it?
Ah well can you feel it?

Deep like seven the life brings its intelligence
Got no time for cleaver
You're late if there's hesitance
Put your foot forward and you'll be a helping hand
Take a step back than your stuck in the quick sand
And just the toxic keeps us locked in

Trik Turner,"Patience at times when its tough makes it
Easy to lose sight in what you strive for so
Much that's why I never trust anyone who tries
To know me, that means to get the best of me

Philosophy is my strategy either way it be
Society plays a role for me that's called
Lunacy to the tensions and the frustrations that
Are unmentioned to the dome either way you

Been a long time since I got down baby
So take a look around it ain't nothing nice
If your caught slippin' just another
Day in the life of that New York living
Where fast times makes for fast ways 
In and out with the latest craze
It takes more than the average to amaze
The typical New Yorker can make you 
Or break you either way it changes you
To something that you thought you'd never be
From rags to riches or riches to rags
Everyone plays a part you can see on

Never seen it's all about the dollar dream

I've been better, but thank you
Tomorrows yesterdays fades fast
Faster, then gives way, I've been better, but thank you

You never have anything good to say about me
That's ok cause everyone's entitled to their own opinions
'Cause everyone's a critic, and even on your best days 
Someone's got something bad to say
Yet I ignore the things I hear, ignore the things I fear
And look past all that tries to bring me down
And I know that I don't have much I 
Sacrifice a good life while I watch these bills keep adding
Up and I know that I'm not getting any younger as another 
Year passes by
I have to stop and wonder
If it's all really worth the struggle
Or that mirage of light I keep chasing at the end of the tunnel
Will get any brighter
Or will it just fade away the closer I get, the further it seems
From reaching my dreams
And I just don't know how much more I can 
Take before I give up and throw it all away

When push comes to shove
You gotta hold on , you gotta be strong
And look for that light from above
Cause everyone's out to bring you down 
And if you can't keep your head up
Then your lost
I've seen better days been told better ways
How to live and how to give, it's relative
I walk with sedatives it's hell I live 
And home is sweet, I'm killing myself softly

It's hard to be, I look at myself, I look at this life
And all I feel is pain, god help me start again
I gotta keep on, I gotta keep on pushin' cause I
Some how some way keep comin' up short
Like everyday my minds playin' tricks on me
Everybody loves sunny days but I prefer
Grey ones and long nights because when the
Day comes, it's just another 24 and I'm still numb
Not so young I know what it takes, they say
Roll with the brakes and slip them ties with the fakes
I still get them shakes just thinkin' bout this

As I pull up to the club
Jumping out of the Jag
24's still spinning with a dealership tag
Brand New
Bright leather guts and pearl blue
These hoes they choosing like a lucky horseshoe
But that's alright cause I don't pay these hoes no mind
As I stroll to the front of the VIP line
Straight in I go, headed straight to the bar
I got a superstar status, so I guess I'm a star
Haters checking me out
Now tell me what's that about?
I'ma chill to the point haters checking me out
Sipping on the Crystal
Bitches want to get wild
Popping X and smoking dro' on the verge of my style
These bitches calling, asking where the after party
The Embassy Suites downtown, room 112, my darling
Bring your friends so we can let this party begin
And bring a box of Magnum rubbers so we can fuck till the end

Damn, why they staring? ho, shit I'm the motherfucker
Not the front door
We better go through the back
See, that was back then, now look where we at
Straight to VIP, my niggaz, man we deep
You gonna go through 2 or 3
Before you get to me
The bitch, and she a G and said ""what's up for later?""
I said ""I'm 20 East, I'm headed to Decatur""
And motherfuck the hater
It's about this making paper
And while she choosing hard, guaranteed I'ma take her
So shake the saltshaker, the dro' is the vapor
I ain't got love for niggaz cause all they try to do is cake her
I ain't sippin on no chaser, that's what we tell the waiter
You goddamn right, I'm a motherfucker player
So tell me how you want it
You riding? Get up on it
I ain't fucking with the ho if she don't know how to donut, for real

Hey, hey bitch
Hey bitch get up it's time to go to work
Time to go to work bitch, it's your boy Lil Jon
Never will I love a bitch
Why would I trust a bitch?
Always gonna dog a bitch
They only good for sucking dick
Or riding on a nigga cock
Trying to get a nigga stock
I'm never gonna break bread
Not even for a little head
I'm a player, not a cake-a-ho
Always gotta break ho, down to the fucking floor
You step up, I'll let you know
It's MOB, BME
P to the I to the M P
No, I'm Southside
Sorry, bitch, you better pay me

Old school white Lac pimpin like I'm Don Juan
When I pull up on the track, I toot-a-loo my horn
Make these hoes come running like Mike for travs
Ain't got my money ho, you bound to get slap
Cause I don't love a bitch and won't save a bitch
If it ain't about money, then it don't make sense
I'll mack a bitch and I'll pimp a bitch
As long as she making me filthy rich

[Don P]
Just up off the pill, drinking on my beer
Sitting on a mill, but I'm pimpin still
Riding round the track, like Goldie in the Mack
Still I'm Don Coreleone pimping hoes from my realm
Mesmerized by the words coming out my mouth
So I'm flushing money quickly out these bitches' bank accounts
After that I bounce
To another ho, in a totally different city
for a whole other show
They say, ""why you don't call?"" I say, ""bitch, where my dividends?""
""You always out of town"" I say, ""bitch, where my dividends?""
""You probably in the club"" I say, ""bitch, where my dividends?""
You bout to make me break your neck, I have to ask your ass again
I'm Don a.k.a ""stay pimpin hard""
That mean hoes gonna march winter, summer, spring and fall
Cause I have to ball, there's no other way
Even if the bitch's pregnant, there's no Happy Mother's Day

Hey bitch (hey bitch) sign your name on the dotted line (sign right here)
Cause you belong to me (you my bitch now)
Hey bitch (hey bitch) sign your name on the dotted line (right here)

[Jazze Pha (+ Lil Jon)]
If you get out line, I'm a slap you out
I'm a slap you out
I'm a slap you out
Better have my money (you better have my money, bitch)
Cause you signed your name on the dotted line
So get off your ass and get on the grind
(Get up, get out there and make my motherfucking money, right now)
Forgot what I am, bitch? What am I?
I'm a pimp in every inch of the word
Every inch of the verb
Every inch of the curb
I'm a hit it, like the lottery baby
Better believe it (please believe it)
Hey, yeah
If it's pimping you wanting (what), pimping you needing (what)
Everyday from me (from a real motherfucking pimp)
But bitch that's all I can see
Any day of the week, when you fucking with me

[Lil Jon]
If you fucking with me, you better get your ass out there
And make that motherfucking money
Rain, sleet or snow
Rob, steal and kill for a motherfucking pimp like me, ho

Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Even though the devil's got you bound.

Take the Word and knock 'em down.

Open up and let him in.

I was telling her as good as God's been I can't afford not to praise his name 
She said in life she wanted more 
There was nothing left this world could offer her 
She said she could hear his voice calling her name 
She said...................... 

(Chorus) 

Young people whatcha waiting for, lo he's standing at your door 
He's knocking won't you let him in he'll forgive your sins now that's a friend 
Things don't always feel right, though weeping may endure for a night 
Are you wit it, I know you wit it then tell your self get it in your spirit

Prayer: Lord Please make it better, I need it better

For always, forever be on time
I promise my love will never die
Tonight before I close my eyes, before I close
My eyes, I promise you

I'll tell you now before I say good night
I wanted to say a million times before
And though I tell you now, the words are hard to find
You move me inside, at times I've even cried
I never told you why but now I promise you

I promise you with every breath I take
For always, forever be on time
I promise my love will never die
Tonight before I close my eyes, before I close
My eyes, I promise you

So lay your head down now and trust me
When I say
When we're as one we can't be separated

For always, forever be on time

He'll brighten up,
Your darkest day.
Put trust in him,
And he'll make a way, 

Anyone the son sets free
Is free indeed
He will set you 
free but first you got to be a believer 
and know that it's by

[Chorus]

Come on in before the sun goes down,
Even though the devil's got you bound.
Know you tired of going round and round,
Take the Word and knock 'em down.
He'll forgive you of your sins
Open up and let him in.
Let the Lord show you his love,
By his blood we're conquers

It's by God's grace,
All things through Christ Jesus.
No weapon formed against me shall proper.
It's by God's grace,
All things through Christ Jesus.
No weapon formed against me 
No weapon formed against me
No weapon formed against me
No weapon formed against me
No weapon formed against me
No weapon formed against me
No weapon formed against me
No weapon formed against me

My got gotta see it",God's Grace [Remix],2011
Trin-i-tee 5:7,"Listen if ya'll don't mind
I just gotta say this
When you've lost everything and 
You don't know which way to turn, some people need
Fame and fortune, but lemme tell u what I need

(I need You) When everything is going wrong (I need You)
When I'm down to my last dime (I need You)
When my back's against the wall (I need You)
Lord I need you (I need You)

Sitting in front my TV
I was watching CNN
Wit tears in my eyes
Lord knows I cried
See I began to wonder
What in the world is going on
One thing after another
I'm barely holdin' on

(I need You) When everything is going wrong (I need You)
When I'm down to my last dime (I need You)
When my back's against the wall (I need You)
Lord I need you (I need You)

When my friends done told a lie (I need You)
And I'm about to loose my mind (I need You)
Ya'll don't understand (I need You)
Lord I need you (I need You)

When I'm on top of the world (everything going just fine)
I've found my life can change (with just a blink of an eye, hey)
From the mountain to the valley low such a long, long fall
So in the good times and in the bad times u better know who to call 

(I need You) When everything is going wrong (I need You)
When I'm down to my last dime (I need You)
When my back's against the wall (I need You)

When my friends done told a lie (I need You)
And I'm about to loose my mind (I need You)
Ya'll don't understand (I need You)
Lord I need you (I need You)

If I'm in a fight or my darkest night
In the middle of máss confusion
In the worst state I've been
No matter what I'm in,
Lord it's your name I'm callin'

(I need You) When everything is going wrong (I need You)
When I'm down to my last dime (I need You)
When my back's against the wall (I need You)
Lord I need you (I need You)

When my friends done told a lie (I need You)

Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance

We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train when it's hot or when cold out
How 'bout in the library on top of books
But you can't be too loud
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out

In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown that's the way I like it twerk
Legs jerk, overworked, underpaid but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade, tag team, off the ropes
On the ocean or in the boat, factories or on hundred spokes
What about up in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream help play my game, Dracula man I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reigns, school teacher let me get my brains

You was still in my corner to press the brace
Till I'm ready in yo arms you kept me safe
Through the thick and thin I'm gon be there for ya
I say a prayer for ya 
Lord knows I care for ya 
Through hard times we got strong  or mother to daughter 
When I was weak you was my bridge over trouble water
Can't nobody replace you 
I'm forever faithful
For you mama I'm grateful 
Your baby girl is a reflection of you
I thank the lord up above cause he blessed me with you, uh
I love you like none other
Cause you can live your whole life but you can only get one mother

(yes mama)

For sharing your blessings upon me (oh mama)

Oh, nigga you mad now, acting bad, pulling out your gats now
All you care about is cash, so my feelings they assed out
And it's so sad how I do for you
Be the woman come through for you

When you do wrong, police come through for you
I'll even bend the truth for you
But the fact of the matter is
Nigga you gon' love, who you gon' love?

You gon' trust, who you gon' trust?
You gon' fuck, who you gon' fuck?
But you won't trust me, no way no how
Ya gotta give ya whole life fo a nigga nowadays

Can't leave your house, can't even speak your mouth
Can't even beat him down
Motherfuckers is so crazy, deranged
Let 'em into your brain, brings misery and pain

'Cause they call us lame, bitches and heffers and sluts
Think your nut is gonna heal my bruises and batters and cuts
Bitches, y'all better get tough and at the same time
Y'all better lock the game and re-rock the game

Get a glock ready, sit back cock and aim
And try to stop the pain 'cause you got a lot to gain
Instead of sitting home waiting on niggas to call
Putting 911 in their beepers and all
We don't deserve this at all y'all

Nigga, how you tame a bitch
Talking 'bout your game legit when you ain't the shit?
Then get wit a chick don't maintain a bitch, you restrain a bitch
Insecure niggas they blame a bitch then reign a bitch

Get a ring try to rename a bitch get an attitude
Play games with the dick and try to tame a bitch
Y'all niggas better critically acclaim a bitch
You call we come take it like a champ drink all your cum

Do a lot of shit I've never done, so I keep my cool
'Cause I ain't the one to start acting up
'Cause he keep a bitch from backing up
I wanna pack my stuff but mama said I can't come back to her

Oh Lord, so I had keep asking ya
For help outta situations killing up my whole life
I'm in love with a thug and he ain't treating my soul right
And I know I don't see him, don't need him
Shit fuck him and feed him
Fish stuck him and leave him quick shit

If you're a nigga with no love and don't want no bitch
Don't see no bitch, don't need no bitch

Fucked up mentally like a dumb hoe
Breaking out all your windows
Tell the po-po's 'bout your dope holes, oh no

I don't need a nigga thinking that he own a bitch

No time for the little dicks, you see the bigger the dick
The bigger the bank, the bigger the Benz
The better the chance to get close to his rich friends

I'm going after the big man, G-string make his dick stand
Make it quick, then slow, head by the night stand
Like lightning, I want a nigga with a wedding ring
Bank accounts in the Philippines, blank note to take everything

See I fuck him in the living room
While his children ain't home
I make him eat it while my period on
A little nasty ho, red bone but a classy ho

Young jazzy ho and don't be scared

Sell the pussy by the grands
And in months you own a Benz
Another week a set of rims
See, if I had the chance to be a virgin again
I'd be fucking by the time I'm ten

See off glass is my motto
Dick sucking in the auto
Quick fucking 'bout to follow
On the back of the truck
Or when I'm dead ass drunk

But I don't get high though
I never took it up the ass, often tried but I pass
And from what I heard it ain't bad

Digits all in your beeper, you want her, better keep her
Last night you was all up in the club, slingin grips
Slippin DJ Roslay, givin dick tips away
Basically, you was holdin like you just went pro

No, I got to go, before you cause a bitch to flick

Top up when the sun set, top down when the sun out
Oh you want me, pushing up your number on the slick
Try to make the scene when I was in front of the click
How bout I pull the thongs off in the summer and shit
Laughing at my joke when it wasn't even funny and shit
She need a t-mac ms shaq she think that I ball
She know I'm a real nigga, plus she love that I'm tall
Checks again when she missed the phone, thinking I called
She want to fall for me look, but she think I'm a dog

Need somebody with some doe
That's cool
Who gon' keep it on the low

Somebody that's off the chain
That's cool

You want to fuck that's cool but you gotta be the greatest
Take me the Prada, buy my the latest
Try it on the jet, fly me to Vegas
The baddest bitch can't nann hoe fade this
Paid bitch, in a gray six, made bitch
Blinging about 10 karats in the bracelet
Face it stick your tongue out I let you taste it
And if you broke when you see me nigga don't say shit
Cause I'm looking for a nigga that's filthy rich
Yo name Silkk, that's cool I'm a silky bitch
Lil mama stay shining like cuts in ice
Off glass make you bust three nuts in a night
And when I put it on ya, I hope you can stand it
I need a tune-up daddy is you the mechanic?
'Cause if you coming at me right with the real cash
You can play with me all night like Dreamcast

[Chorus:]

You need a soulja in your life, that's right

Your friends wonder why the house you never leaving
They knew wut you gettin' in life

See I'm a real ass chick I'm a stay by your side
And when its time to ride for my man, I'm a ride

Just be a down chick cause you ain't gotta slave in fact 
Not cook, clean or nothing cause I got maids for that

Just treat me how you want to be treated
'Cause if I suck it and fuck it you gon' beat it and eat it

So I gots to put it on ya, have ya acting all silly
Then try to convince yourself that you ain't catching feelings
I need a girl who bout it and know how to hit it
You ain't gotta scheme on the doe,
'Cause if ya cards right, you gon get it
Some chicks ain't real though, (some niggas'll stunt)
I know what a woman need, (i know what a nigga want)
So keep it tight, and fuck the world
And who ever end up with me, that's one lucky girl

[Chorus 1 - 1/2]
are you waiting
waiting for something that's wrong
are you waiting
you know sometimes a girl must move along

[Verse 1]
As I vibe with the music, I just think about the times
I came in after a day and at times
Climbed in the same bed wished my man was lyin
He questioned me ""I'm I defying (no),"" I was lyin
He was a real good man, he worked and all
I wanted a hustle, so I can hurt them all (shit)
I coulda made love, but I wanted to be fucked
He had a lot to offer it just wasn't enough
I like da candle-coated 'lac (uh huh) the niggaz smokin sacks (i like da thugs)
The football games, fortunate fame
And more importantly, I wanted me a name
The je-wells, the crew-es, the cell
No more projects, the foolish gets well (I'm tired of dat shit)
The (?) weed from Pre-me's on poken beans
And me,  I'm still ghetto I push ah (?) when you see me on TV
But I'm all woman, uh

(Chorus 1x)

[Verse 2]
y'all know I'm from Miami right
But, do y'all really know what Miami like
Miami life
Da fast pace, the comfy cash chase
Da clothes, cars, ohhh God
Niggaz sell dope get rich
Bitches sell pussy get rich, get down or don't get shit (dats right)
No options, no college, no loans
No cash, No knowledge
I'm sexy as hell you know I'm gon profit
And trust me, my skills are well polished
I chat niggaz down pat niggaz down
Set him up right if he dat big a clown
I had to, well I didn't have to
But, what about me (sshhiitt) I had to have to
I wanted a Rolly a million dat'll hold me
Lock a access for Colby you know me (uh)

(Chorus 1x)

[Verse 3]
I'm da same woman, Mercedes or the Civic
Fuck the Cris, I just give it how I get it
I'm the spokesperson 4 ev'ry sista who soul seachin
Still strollin these clubs with no purpose
Stay in the mall and won't purchase
Straight boostin
Bad checks or they leasin they mouth
Robbers put a piece in their mouth
For whatcha man keep in their house
They pull gats for stacks tall as Shaq
You chickens don't know me well
I'm not impressed witcha Findi purses and ponytails
Always surface with your phony tails
When you need to be in school all day on a chase
I'm goin to work supported you and you're place
Or with a athletic wit a cool one in the safe
Why suck dick to keep food on the place
I (?) in baked potatoes take the payload

(Chorus 2x)

It's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong",100%,2002

Ugh, Ugh, Ugh....Woooo!!!

Yo, I'm a diamond in the rough

Any little old city is like nowhere to run
The game's on you till you stand on your own two

Check this out niggas---This is what we gonna do
1!- We gon' bang this
2!- We gon' sing this
3!- We on top of the world but we ain't saying shit

It's the movement, and the truth is
'Cause Trina and Missy ain't gots to prove shit
We brake down floors (BAM!!)
Brake down doors (BOOM!!)

5 month tours just brake down do'
We brake down hoes, we brake down foes
Run through pockets just straight down yo's
M-I-A to V-A its real why'all

We shakin' up bottles to let 'em spill why'all
This is Slip-N-Slide askin' ""What the deal why'all?""
If you ain't throwin' them bows then I don't feel why'all

Up in the spot you got your glocks on lock and.
Hey! This join goin' knock
Up in the club I said this joint don't stop

Low cut copes when Trina come round
Reggae DJ screamin ""COME DOWN!!""
We ?? it off top but want some now

Sit back-- and praise the don diva

Who blows streets up? Ya man want eat us?
Different flows,flavors,hoes- No Favors!

Don't pay us we'll shut that down
What's that loud? (Owww!!) Cut that down!
Got a CL6 but what's that now?
If he not talkin big money, Fuck that clown!

Excuse my french, I won't stress the issue
If he ain't lookin out he's just messin with you
I'm a Mercedes mami, maybe the Lex official
If you want to get on I'll have Flex to hit you

[Chorus]

Damn why'all-Da-Da-Da-Da Damn why'all!
Hurtin and scurrin I'm like I took my panties off
Knuckle and Buckle em' nigga I ain't scared of why'all

We can make it last
You and me  
We can make it last
You and me
We can make it last
You and me
We can make it last
You and me...

[Verse 1]
It was me and you Trina who shared the hard times
Still in love wit niggas who was serving some hard times
Or involved wit niggas who lost their lives
When Hollywood passed I nearly lost my mind
I then rolled wit the traffickers worked in the Maximas
When D.A in back of us, I'm stretched out nervous
Asking myself, ""Bitch was this really worth it?""
What's my purpose I gotta keep searching
It was me and you Trina who asked the same questions
we decided when and which hoes we would fuck it
shop wit thug wit get into some thug shit
turn 'em on to niggas who deep into that thug shit
get money fuck a little let a nigga touch a little
had to make moves our home was so fucking little
Feel that? I know you do, guess what I wrote it too
Please recognize this is a hip hop quoteable

[Chorus] + (over lapping the chorus)
(And even through the loneliest time
 we survived through our loneliest nights
 Just think about the struggling times
 when we survived through a nickel and dime
 And even if I had all the bread in the world
 I'd give it all up for one shot at
 You and Me, I'm that same bitch)

[Verse 2]
You and me were best friends but I'm the one you talk about?
I showed love to everybody before I walked about
the parties the club the function
I leave you bring up discussions on who I'm fucking
You and me were best friends we talked about abortions
As little girls hair braided o the same porches
We promised each other we would share the same losses
Ya baby daddy passed we share the same losses
It was you and me hoe getting see-notes
bell hoppers to the death while Irish hoes deep throat
Yeah it's beef in the air and why she know
If anybody do she know how we flow
Miami bitches you know how we go
Nice entourage lock mints wonder bras
Sit in the club I miss how it was

[Chorus] + (over lapping the chorus)

[Verse 3]
You know it's really funny how the tables turn
I moved forward and thank God for the lessons learned
I used to strip clubs as a stepping stone
Hit the stage got paid it wasn't my second home
Ask somebody Trina been the shit on the streets  
Roll wrap late nights been the shit on the beach
Brought blue baby jeans just to shit on the ?
Keep tall body guys just to sit underneath
Sit back pop bottle ya'll sit on ya'll feet
Screaming my name tryna get in V.I.P
I don't own the club boo
I'm just showing love too
But every time I see ya face I think of me and you
It's disappointing that you fell off well not fell off
I just can't accept you not being well off
It wouldn't be me if I didn't tell all
I even tried to call you but ya cell off

An fuck 'em out the belly store with ten bags?
Fly as a muthafucka girly on my staple
'Cause her friends say I'm a tummy sucker
Don't go below the navel

I'm blowin' on Jamaica
I'm in the pimper beemer
I'm with a salt shaker
Now I'm in Dade County

I try to holla at 'em
But they all trick bitches

Yea and I put her on cash money
She start wobblin' that ass for me
She start modelin'
She see the models in the Maybach

And she make sure she say that

See a fly nigga baby, yeah I don't trip
Just give em lil' thigh
Mama give em lil' hip
And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips
Give em lil' die
Mama give em lil' hip
Then you give 'em lil' wind up
Give em a lil' dip
And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars

Inside of a pink phantom
If ya man got that cash
Then best believe I met him
'Cause I'm sharp as a machete
And I cuss like Freddie
Niggas call me Betty Crocker

Got stacks on top of stacks
Cup in the meal ticket

Gladys Knight and the Pips
All my niggas jump around
Girls jump on that dick
It ain't gonna be no standin' around
Now lets get crunk in this bitch
And ladies
Show em yo shit
A lil' hip a lil' thigh
More pressure for the eye
And the more a nigga try
You can find me stretched out
In my 850i
Or my big 600
Believe Trina done it
Believe them diamonds studded
Stay flooded like a damn
Chase grams cause I am what I am
Don't give a damn

Yep and make that nigga ball for ya
Then have him beggin' for that kitty cat
Wining and dining for that ass
Give him none of that
Just let him know

I'm on fire, feel it burnin in my bones
Right in 20 {?} deep and Cali playin my song
It's my birthday, it's my birthday
Why did I come in this club with no panties on in the first place?
But in the worst case scenario
I'm in the middle of the danceflo', holla if you hear me though
Party's on, nigga bring bread
Look what you drivin baby to, you got some mean head
Call me supreme red, but when I fade it call me X-rated
Hump in my back, lift my rump, and then I perculate it

[Chorus One]

[Trina]
Ay listen, game recognizes game in the club
Ladies point him out if you see a lame in the club
Gimme, 50 Crist's and a hundred Moe's
Forget a table bring it to me on the danceflo'
I'm in this motherfucker drinkin 'bout to lose my mind
Me and Oprah made a sandwich out of Ginuwine
Yo, everybody in they birthday suits
We gon' ball 'til we fall and you can ride if you want to
Ain't tryin to hear 'bout what you don't do
So put your pimp cups and shake this booty to the ground
Keep me moanin makin funny sounds
Dirty dancin in the club, it's my birthday, so what?

Trina,"Yeah, look here, Trina
I mean, me and you, we been friends for a minute but
You know how we get down, you know late night
You know, we do what we do, we go our separate ways but

Shit, lately I been feelin' kinda different
Like, I been catchin' feelings for you and shit
You know when you call me Daddy and all that
Fuckin' with my head, for real

I never knew that I would fall so deep in love with her
Call me lover, friend, girl, we was just hushin' it up
You got me feenin' for more

When other niggaz used to call you after midnight
It never bothered me, girl, we was only friends, right?
So why does it hurt more and more?

Girl I get excited whenever you call my phone
I got a special ringer whenever you call me girl it goes
""I can't leave you alone"", remember that?

You got me feenin', yeah, feenin', shit, feenin'
So, baby, I'm pleading for you to bring your body home to me
And let me lay you down

Bring your body home to daddy
Girl, I love it when you call me daddy
Baby, you're my sexy little mama
Step in my bedroom girl and we can get it on

Bring your body home to daddy
Girl, I love it when you call me daddy
Baby, you're my sexy little mama
Step in my bedroom girl and we can get it on

I'm tired of the fightin', the fussin' and cussin'
Late night discussions of who you think I'm fuckin'
You puttin' me on guilt trips, like I can't see
You storin' his name for hers in your caller ID

Look I'm a Queen, the Don Diva
We should just flee in the lime green Seline two seater, you and me
My top down and yes, my hair is blowin'
Flashbacks of you and me, got me moanin' but

Who you lovin', who you wanna be huggin'
I seen her in your six hundred and you claim it's your cousin
Look, I know we agreed to, to see other people
But those feelings were shallow like my lingerie see through

We both played this game unfaithfully
See me with the next man and now you wanna play with me
Yo' I'm confused but I still wanna proceed
Without you I'm incomplete, you make me so weak
I love it when you say

Bring your body home to daddy
Girl, I love it when you call me daddy
Baby, you're my sexy little mama
Step in my bedroom girl and we can get it on

Bring your body home to daddy
Girl, I love it when you call me daddy
Baby, you're my sexy little mama
Step in my bedroom girl and we can get it on

I remember late nights, we would just kiss
I remember wearin' them girdles and takin' them trips
And I remember that we said, it would never come to this
Never let something come between our relationship

Now how can I leave you to be with someone else
Without finding out, how you truly felt
All the ridin' on horses and creepin' and abortions
Thoughts of marriage, all white playin' organs

It started from the rough sex on the deck of the yacht
Followed by Don Perion and the Canary watch
All the shoes from Italy, it was cool
Even a villa in Sicily but it wasn't me

But I should of made it crystal clear that I didn't really care
Whether you was dead broke or you was a millionaire
From our first date to our anniversary
My thoughts changed of leavin' when I heard you say to me

Bring your body home to daddy
Girl, I love it when you call me daddy
Baby, you're my sexy little mama
Step in my bedroom girl and we can get it on

Bring your body home to daddy
Girl, I love it when you call me daddy
Baby, you're my sexy little mama
Step in my bedroom girl and we can get it on

Hold on 1 sec. baby, hello?

(reach out, touch me)

Ain't nothin' sweeter than a diva named Trina 
Fresh to death like I live at the cleaners 
I'm so sexy I could kiss myself 
But why do it when I know that I could get some help 
Yo take my number, let it marinate, don't even wonder how I turned a winter's night into summer 
Ponder, in ya mind, this spot it 69,

Be prepared to cross our lines that connect-picture that 

[Chorus] 

Can ya hear me nanna?

Ooh my bedroom moans louder than ring tones 
My sexy ninja have ya shoppin at Queen's Home 
My girls told me bout your line with a 3-way 
But this curious cat don't wanna go off what 'she' say 
So get over to room star 67 
Where I block the haters and a playa get a piece of heaven 
Lemme know when you downstairs in mike's kitchen, it's the playgirl's suite 
Before I change my decision 
Curve instructions no disturbance when I nurse on you 
Off the hook in a lawn waitin' in my birthday suit 
No dis when I give you my hand 
I'm about to give the limit to plan-goddamn

Ain't nuttin to it but to do it
Let me holla at you baby
I know a lot of NFL players and a lot of NBA players (Sexy gurl!)
Like to holla at you, you know, but it's different hollering at me
You know what I'm saying? (Sexy gurl!)
Whatever they can give you, I can give it to you times two
(Sexy gurl, but I really need you gurl!)
But in a gangsta way, can you dig it?

[Trina]
I woke up around ten o'clock this morning
I gave myself a stretch up, a morning yawning
Went to the bathroom to wash up
Put on my French-lace panties and my Enyce warm-up
I said, ""Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the baddest bitch of them all?""
There was a quick pause
Then the mirror responded, ""You know you got it locked stop actin' retarded.""
Fa sho, that's why these bitches don't want beef
Cause I, flash the Roley with the all yellow deese
Got the sunflower-yellow on the fingernails
And the yellow Louie bag with the pastels
Yo I'm livin' like a model while my rap sales (Why?)
Cause niggaz love the way my back swells
Plus I show my ladies how to mack males
Fuck posin' for BlackTail, I'm bout to sign a PlayBoy deal, unh

[Chorus:]
Sexy gurl, (sexy, sexy)
You're my little sexy gurl (sexy gurl)
And I really love you gurl (love you gurl)

Put no one above you gurl (above you gurl)
Wanna kiss and hug you gurl (hug you gurl)
You're a little sexy gurl (sexy, sexy)
But I really love you gurl (love you gurl)
Come a little

Close to the P-I- mpin'
Hop in the Coupe with Snoop go on a mission (mission)
Nonstop no intermission, breakfast in bed
We do head in the kitchen (ooooh!)
It's a lo-ve-ly day
You can hang out in the pool, act a fool or just bubble and bathe
And when you get it I love how you don't talk about me
But you lovin' the Dogg, that's what I like about it
M-I-A don't get in my way, the baddest bitch with the play-yi-yay (play-yi-yay)
And everyday I try to get my play on
This California lifestyle help you stay on (stay on)
I'm choppin' it up, (choppin' it up) I got the key so I'm lockin' it up (lockin' it up)
Flashin' 'em, (flashin' 'em) blastin' 'em (blastin' 'em)
I'm rollin' with a boss bitch passin' 'em
Come here cutie

Better than Fendi and Gucci
You need a little more for me to be a groupie (that's right)
How bout a house down out on San Succi
Sittin' on an acre so we could move loosely
That's just how it goes
Vera Wang from the window pane down to the tips of my toes (Oh!)
And when I'm ready to leave I pull a Porsche out
Don't want no sticks or no seeds I go to Snoop's house
Fuck a professor, I need an investor (unh huh)
To eat me like Hannibal Lector
And keep me in a pink Kompressor, cups processor
And I don't want nuttin' lesser

And pull them things off to the side
And let a nigga know
Is we gun fuck tonight

See good pussy
Will bring the freak out ya
But if you eat it and don't get cheated
The first off I beat the breaks off her
No sense in half-steppin'
Get serious
Get the titties suckin' like
Clit rubbin' and ass grabbin'
I eat that pussy ass backwards
A few strokes of this long warm tongue
Should make the pussy cum
So much for round one
I spend a whole round two and back again
Stick in move
Stick in move

[Chorus]

I need a real man
I'm sick of playin' with lil' boys
I'm tryin' to explore more like hot oils and sex toys
I can't keep fakin'
Man I'm so backed up and
I can't eat I can't sleep
My knees weak makin' me keep shakin'
I need a real nigga to come save me
One who pamper me and bathe me
And make me wanna swallow his baby
Talkin' thug shit like fuck me crazy
From the back or in the butt
I'm like fuck me baby fuck me baby

[Chorus]

All the matter is
I can get you wet again
Suck you fuck you better than
Any other nigga can
I specialize in multi orgasms
Gettin' rid of back spasms
And do it all without Viagra
I'll fuck you all night
Make you sleep all day
Treat you to breakfast then
Eat you for breakfast
I know baby
I'm so unselfish
But you're lovin' it besides
I'm a freak so I can't help it
All I need is old slow songs
One cold shot of patron
See you walkin' around me in a thong
And it'll be over before the chorus come back on
You'll be leaving and I'll be ab libin'
And we'll be singin' our damn song
It's like the first time we made each other cum
We'll be suckin' and fuck each other
Taste each other cum
No soul alive can erase what we done
All our horny sticky memories you are stuck to me permanently

Trina,"Oh, it can't be G.O.O.D music my Grammy Family
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry
Now I'm hoppin' out the limo or either the Lam be
But you niggaz gon' get in 'til you get to Miami

GLC gon' be stoned as Angie
I be Don see, Johnny Patrone and me
It's a celebration, bitches, more bottles of champaign
I ain't in love with the same stripper that sprung T
Pain and all this Louis Vuitton shit ain't cheap, man

Dawg, I can't keep sayin' G.O.O.D music the greatest latest
Stuntin' out the middle of nowhere like Vegas
From the Chi, the city of hella haters
Where we keep risin' to the top like elevators

Hi haters, I'm back of hiatus
I feel just like you, I mean even I hate us
Turn the radio down I mean every song
Yeezy got a vision that's clearer than Evian
Used to hit the radio them faggots ain't let me on

Until Khaled turned up the volume
Hit the club wit it come on homie they wildin'
Nas done told you come on homie we major
Really Doe told you hoes where we stayin'
G.O.O.D music up in this bitch now quit playin'

Dawg, it can't be G.O.O.D. music the Grammy Family
A little bit a stuntin', flickin', dawg, it ain't deep
I'm only tryin' to spend what they claim you can't keep
Before you die so I make sure I stay on the Chi side
Like Lake Shore Drive, The Grammy Family

It's the Cons fool, word

No, it can't be G.O.O.D. music my Grammy Family
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry
Now we hoppin' out the limo or either the Lam be
And after music meeting wit evenings with Angie

It's gon' prolly add a joint that got John Legend and me
And we be in Miami so when they spot me in Bentley
It's gon' be a stampede 'cause we be racin' Bentleys
No different than Grand Prix's

Fam please, don't make my man squeeze
And we can take it to the cars and I'll show you the hand speed
I started independent with owners from land speed
But now they recognize the way they did for Sam Sneed

And since I got my shot like I was call and man be
I hope they lose they spot guarantee a plan be
We'll be waitin' in the telly like Jamie and Fancy

Prolly paintin' they nails in nuthin' but they panties
And we'll be up town Jimmy and Camby
Headed to the game to watch Kenyon and Camby

They can't breathe or hardly catch they next breath
And I know my nigga Ye told you we was the best dressed
I know I got a buzz so plan up the next step

So what ya'll wanna do when it comes to that next check
And bet Quence and Khaled know what the business is
So open up them envelopes you know who the winners is

On Grammy night call it G.O.O.D. family night
Celebrate tonight, oh, it's alright, it's alright, yeah",Grammy Family,2006

I got a bottle, I got a cup
I got ice, so what's up
Walk in the club wearing superstar clothes
Feelin' like money cause I collect dough
Moe miney meenie inny
Whose got the trone (Patrone) and Henny?

I been sippin' on Cavalli that shits so strong
Like Paris Hilton, gotta carry me home
So full, so far gone
Forgot where I parked, and lost my iPhone
Still lookin' good and pretty
Bad bitch in every city
Rocks, diamonds, I got plenty
Ice for the cup, now pour the Henney
Escorted in the club, I brought the whole team
Ain't no guest, it's a rock-star theme
Everybody lookin' of course it's the queen
They admirin' the crown, and the 10 caret ring
I'm known for pimpin' these rappers
I should get an Oscar award for my acting
When they actually think that I'm feelin' em
That's when I take they money, then I'm killin' em

Watch me get ghost in the phantom
Somethin' like a pimp like David Banner

Crooked letter I humpback humpback

Plus I'm gonna make it rain
So much money they think she's insane
You a 7 digit nigga if you holla at a brah
With a 7 digit figga you should come in by the bar
I'm talkin' buying bottles, Cavalli Vodka
I'm wet and hot like lava
I'm switchin' 4 lanes in range
Hangin' out the roof talkin' money ain't a thing
Comin' all out my shirt on champagne
Damn lill miss Trina off da chain

I don't swerve I spin
Drive a pearl phantom

Stuntin' on you, like boo who you
I'm a icon bitch I though you knew
I only drop bombs, haters be like uh-uh
Girl who she think she is
I'm is what you want is

Take a vacation girl

'cause she can't get sick of my love

I want you to myself, I guess I'm so selfish

And you grind on me thighs

I know a little spot
Where the beach is the bluest

And carpul sayin' Lucas

You know what I'm about
Now show me what you got

Just because I'm more fun

She pours her emotions
Excessive morn for my love
Deep in her thoughts

Just because I get floss
Still gonna press for my love

Hung my tears out to dry
Then my dreams fell out of that clear blue sky

Feelin' so safe and sound
Then somethin' else knocks me down

Completely, hopelessly fallen in love
He's just what you're lookin' for
The only problem is, that the man's not sure
Another guy'll give you everything

The only problem is you don't feel a thing
Well I know from experience
Nothin's ever gonna make perfect sense
Oh, one day you get what you want
But it's not what you think
Then you get what you need

Whenever that pussy get soaked we can call it today
I wanna catch ya on that look and put it on ya ass
And pin yo lil ass up and fuck ya like a mass
I wanna finger you first make ya wanna fuck me bad
Soon as I feel that pussy get wet step on the gas
And I'm a fuck ya from the back but I'm a do it last

Trina,"[Verse 1]
Yea its clear
I'm livin' the life of the rich and the famous
In every magazine published I'm gracin' the pages,
Media versus celebrities, its outrageous
Put on a few septics you can rock a few stages
I'm setting new standards for women, rappers embracing
My chronological makeup a switch a bitch pace up
A trend setter, go getta, money maker, bread winner
Dropped in 98
Had the world sayin' nan nigga

[Chorus]
I been around the world
And er' body hatin'
If they talkin' I'm the topic of the conversation
Now clear it out, clear it out
I had it up to here
Clear it out, clear it out
I had it up to here
I had a lot of friends
Now got a lot of foes
When you gettin' money, this is just the way it goes
Now clear it out, clear it out
I had it up to here
Clear it out, clear it out
I had it up to here

[Verse 2]
Now er' body talkin' bout me
I could give a damn though
If they hatin' now
Wait till they see me in the lambo
Thousand dollas shoes, European jewels
Million dolla crib with the swimmin' pools
I'm just doin' me you should be doin' you 
Get your own hoe don't worry bout my revenue
I brought it from the hood to the big screen
Now I'm prime time cover of the magazine

He told me stay real, I'm ma make you real rich 
Back to reality is this real?

Trina,"[Trina: spoken]
Hi this is Trina
And I'm standing 5'2 125 pounds 34, 26, 36
Beautiful lite grey eyes, long black curly hair that
Hangs down to the middle of my back and right now I'm home alone and
I'm looking to try something new so if your listening
Why don't you leave me a message
Ha ha ha ha

[Chorus:]
Take your hands and close your eyes and picture me
Touching your thighs do you feel your body next to me
I'm in your mind but physically it feels so real when we're on the phone
The way you talk and the moan I put your body to the test it's not
A fantasy but it's phone sex

[Trina:]
What's your description I told you mine I was feeling real horny
Called the party line dude sounded so good I ain't waste
No time I'm a take my clothes off and just go for mine
The way that he was talking and describing himself I picture
Reggie bush and I ain't seeing nothing else my eyes closed tight
On the living room couch one hand up my (umm) putting fingers
In my mouth cheating on my man I'm getting my freak on long as it ain't real
I ain't doing nothing wrong just a dirty fantasy on the
Football field me laid in the grass wanna love how it feel
Pulling on my hair biting on my lips throwing it back thrusting my hips
Pouring champagne down and he taking sweet sips got me bout to climax he took me on a trip ah

[Chorus:]

[Trina:]
The next day I called the party line again I was looking for that voice
That's when I bumped in a thug that sounded like trick to me
You should have heard that nasty fantasy
He made me see us in a school house
I was the last student left and was bout to walk out
He said bend over and show him a shot in my private school skirt
So aroused I got hard as a missile I blew on his whistle playing back and forth
For this nigga I can't dismiss you he asked can I kiss then I got wet
This phone bone thing is getting better than sex don't need protection everything's
Safe I even let him spank me I came on his (ah) I know he was so amazed
To hear me come on the phone we wasn't playing no games
We was getting it on ah

[Qwote:]
Do you feel me baby sexing your body touching you softly
Making you want me go head close your eyes
Put your hands on your thighs let's fantasize
From the other end of the line do you feel me baby sexing your body
Touching you softly making you want me go head close your eyes
Put your hands on your thighs let's fantasize
From the other end of the line

Hope you find what you looking for
Back on the market

I got my own money, there's nobody I need I need I need my own space
I'm single again, who's who I'm mingling wit
Ball players center seats to the game
Ring side still doing my thing
Change my number, switch my cars up
Six months with you match my cars up

Got my own diamonds so I gave him back the promise ring

Smoking on Cali bud that's how a real G show a bitch Cali love (Cali love)

Why do I feel so lonely in a major way?
You know this shit was real and you know it baby
I didn't wanna baby, And it drive you crazy
Even though you gotta man you forever my lady
I miss sipping on your daiquiris
I miss your macaroni and cheese, yes indeed
With no care, I hit you bare, you know wassup
Knowing your body would nut, I taught you everything
Make you cry, make you smile, at the same time
Dumb shit, baby girl I miss your tongue kiss
Miss laying in the bed with you
Miss your people and the soul food they fed a nigga
Most of all I miss you, I'm having flashbacks
Of you coming across the track with your hair wrapped
Miss talking on the phone til' the early morning
Making love off Keith Sweat songs
No one can do me like (you)

I miss kissing on you
You know I miss kissing on you
I miss kissing on (you)
Miss touching on you baby
I miss touching on you
I miss touching on you baby
I can't stop thinking about (you)
I can't stop thinking about you girl
I can't stop thinking about (you)
I can't stop thinking about you girl

It's no mistake that I'm amazing
You kissin touch in lovin my body, the things you do to me
You keep it true to me, all this shit ain't new to me
I been messing with ballers kept me lace in top jewlery
A hood nigga like you yeah I like that
Your swagg on point and you keep it coming right back
When you text I right back, yeah right back
I know you like that, that's why I handle that
Bedroom lights off, we kissin slow to a track
It ain't even bout the sex, I crave the gangsta way you act
When you all up in that, you so smooth with it
That's why I never hesitate to say ""daddy come and get it""
I got my Vicky's on and my Diamond Princess perfume
I can't help but think about the thing we do up in the room
When it's just me and you
A fantasy come true
I can't describe Ooohhh
(I miss kissin on)

I miss kissing on you
You know I miss kissing on you
I miss kissing on (you)
Miss touching on you baby

I can't stop thinking about (you)
I can't stop thinking about you girl
I can't stop thinking about (you)
I can't stop thinking about you girl

I swear to god I miss it all
The way that you would call
Beating up your pussy, knocking pictures off the wall
In the studio thinking to myself, ""I got one song left, and I'm coming home to you""
Love it when I hit you from the back and you look back at me
Our sex attractive like metal to a magnet
Turn that T.I. On, that's her shit right there
Get drunk, now she hollering, ""that's her dick right there""
I send this off to the ladies who had my head grown
A pretty black girl, a couple red bones
I guess we learn from each other cause we're stepping-stones
With kids now like ""damn, that's how it is now""
Riding to New Orleans, laughing the whole time
Living life with out a care, walking down Canal
I remember how you smell, the polish on your toes
Remember the first time you went down low
Nobody did it like (you)",Miss Kissin' on You,2009

Cause I can't get enough of that thing girl

Yo lets do it up in Disney in the magic kingdom
You can tug on my Giuseppe's in my Badgly Mischka's

Or you can even call me wanda, cause I'm red to go

And drill you on the roller coaster
Call your girlfriends over we can have a sleepover
Buy yo ass a jeep, so I can fuck you in the range rover
Pictures of her nude, On a cruise we gone make the news,

Damn it turn me on, when we do it in your mama home
Father long gone but Gucci can be your daddy baby

Plus he was doing Lynn, and she ain't nothing like amazing
Her stuff run deep, and he don't have a occupation

Bow leg, red bone, long hair, real thick
Do me at my mama house, nah I don't think so

With the newest Maybach, and inside a black card

Promise to get your body so hot

In front of the police
In front of your daddy
Girl its you and me
And I don't give a damn
That's why they call me Bobby V

In love and maybe you've never felt the things that I've felt (oh oh)
See I've never had this tingle inside from a man 
Feels like he makes my heart melt 
I mean the way that he looks at me is a look 
I've never got from another brother 
He's cool, got swag, calm, collective, and you know
What else he's a damn good lover 
See he knows what it takes to keep up on my face
And he knows when I'm feeling unconvertable 
And our relationship is out of place
The taste of his lips the swag in his walk 
How he so disciplined ambitious and the way that he talks a Capricorn 

Hm hm hm stole my heart and I don't even want it back
He can have it, he can have it, he can have it, he can have it
Cause he got it like that 

(he can have it baby, he can have it, oh yeah he can have it)
So independent, focused, 
And he knows how to love yes

It would be you I'd be speaking of the tent sign of a zodiac 
One of the most serious and stable, reliable, responsible,
And the characteristic that I like most is ladies 
He always ready, willing, 
And able now when God created him 
I know he had to be in good mood 
Because my man gives me the up-most respect

And ladies he's never disrespectful and he's never rude
Loving, caring, and giving he's all of the above I just want to say
'Thank You God for giving me all I've been dreaming of'

So sexy his charm, his motivation, his patience, 
All combine together as one man, my man
Strong, but careful of every move that he make 
All the steps that he takes real not fake
The Capricorn, the Capricorn, the Capricorn, 
That's all I ever needed
All I ever wanted
So I took this time out of my life 
To let you know how I was feeling about my Capricorn
My Capricorn, my Capricorn, Capricorn,
Baby I Love You your love waiting here for you
So where ever you are, 
Whatever station you listening to right now I'm here
Somebody call my Capricorn home for me 
Or better yet I'll do it myself.

Throw my face in the pillow now, hey

When he throw me that pipe I just pack them stacks up 
Throw ma face in the pillow now, hey

Dang so damn hood, dang a lang so good 
Like a foot long sub eat it all if you could 
Stomach like a jerk, do his six pack good

They probably standing ear to wall and whats he doing to me 

Excuse me can I see your dang a lang brother 
I mean you know just juggle your balls like the wrangling brothers 
I'm the harajuku barbie I ain't tripping on your change 
I mean look I got the sports package on my range 
I just dip in the pink for the pink effect 
D-d-d-diamonds on my neck for the link effect 
And I was wondering if I can lip sync on that 
You know my name rings (ting) ring tinkle bells 
Wa-wa-wa-watch (that) 
Chain (check) 
They be on a rain check 
I be on the move 
They be reaching but they can't catch

On the island styling 
Black Miley Cyrus saying hi to pirates 
I be singing them ballads 
When he tossing my salad 
When I pack my palette you see is 
Colorful carrots 
I be singing them ballads 
When he tossing my salad 
When I pack my palette all you see is 
Colorful carrots

I went looking for ur phone when I shouldn't have 
Cause I found just what I was looking for
A new number says its Kelly should I call it or should I just ignore
Now I'm sittin' here wondering when you're coming home
Then I thought about it everything that's going on
I gotta leave this relationship 
But I'm not leaving here
So let me get my list out
What do I want other than this house
First off let me put your bitch out call me crazy if you want her 
But I don't care
Now back to my list
Gotta have the house check
Do I want the car check
Do I want the money check
Gotta have it all check
And I deserve it hope it was worth it
And I don't think that I'll be needing your service

If I'm gonna have to hurt u gonna feel it how I feel it
Play the cards how I deal it
You know I was the realist
Cause the way you going bout this like I never meant shit
Now you want the other bitch cause we had an argument
O-K roll the dice I'm a show you how it go
And since u wanna do it dirty watch this fire crack a blow
This ain't no tip or tap shit its all about the principle
How you expect to leave me without a comma or decimal
Pay me for my pain
Pay me for my time
Nigga you can say the bullshit cause everything is mine
From the house in west pond to the yatch in burlese
You can keep your sad face baby hand me them keys
Cause the shit you said it did it
Threw me way off track
But when a woman is fed up no it ain't no turning back
Only thing gonna make me smile is if I feel my satisfaction
Is seeing you hurt is fuckin' you suffering while I'm relaxing

So now I need his house (I need his house)
I need his cars (I need his cars)
And then the bank (and then the bank)
I want it all (I want it all)
I gave you all my love and got nothing in return

Since fourteen ain't nah hoes stop me
Money I get it, on the tracks I spit it
Thats why the credit cards don't come with no limits
Y'all just don't get it, a crib with no tenets
Walk through closets like I’m walking outta limits
Now thats swagger on a hundred thousand trillion
Row of bad bitches and they all look Brazilian
These niggas can't leave me, I swear they can't leave me

Pussy stay wet, sex so good

Still walk around with 5 thousand dollar boots
So when I'm in the club the chicks get jealous
Cause I'm dat bitch that still keep a mean fetish
Still stack lettuce, still stack cheese
And I got a bad temper tell your nigga say please
Cause this is for the G's, never for the Busta's

Sick from the lips, caramel wanna try it

I'm talkin' homegirl be lookin' like she just stepped outta a magazine
I'm talkin' niggas I'm gonna be somethin' serious

Gotti here go twelve bars
Gucci Mane got nine cars
We don't call 'em dimes no more
'09 we call 'em five stars
I'm a five-star nigga, this a five-star clique
That's a 645, this that new M6
Pay her bills, get her hair fixed
Might even pay her rent
And the way she give it to me
Best money I ever spent
I can't even lie, I'm so super high
Do not need her, will not keep her
Unless she is fly
Gucci Mane's a thug, B; your man is a scrub, see
She loves me now, she loves you not
Yea all my bitches love me
And if you in Atlanta
Look up Gucci, girl and beep me
And we can find a five-star hotel you can meet me

[Chorus]
That's a five-star chick
Now that's a five-star chick, if your credit score high
Feet and nails stay fly, keep your juice-box wet
And your head somethin' fine
You a five-star chick
I want a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick
I want a five-star chick

It's your boy Yo Gotti, I do grade A shit
I'm the realist nigga walkin'
And this the remix and still I'm out here lookin'
For a five-star chick
When I catch her, I'mma bless her
With a five-star kid
She a natural born hustla
She ain't chasin' no suckas
On a mission for a real nigga
She ain't never fucked a busta
So your cars and your jewelry that she really don't excite
And all them hatin'-ass hoes in the club want to fight
She was born in the A, went to school in D.C
Got a job in Dallas, Texas then moved to Tennessee
If you ain't a five-star, need to go ahead and face it
Fake Gucci, fake Louis, shorty that'll make you basic

[Chorus]

See I'm a five-star chick
Cause I ain't that other chick
She been strugglin' for hers
From the womb I been rich
I ain't gotta talk about the money in the shoe game
All you gotta do is Google Trina
See the proof, Mane
Cause ain't none of these hoes, doing shows in a recession
They cards get declined, now they suffering a depression
While I'm spending meals, signin' all kinda deals
I'm a five-star chick, eatin' five-star meals
My whole lifestyle like Coming To America
All my Louis luggage
You see my bag, how I carry her
Walkin' through the airport
Like I'm in a parade on my hologram
Loggin' on to E-Trade

[Chorus]

I just had a epiphany, I need to go to Tiffany's
Fendi on my slippers, and my cookies always slippery
I don't need help, I pay the bills on time
So I be yellin' fuck 'em, with a dildo sign
Bye little Mama, you a three-star
I ain't sleepin' when I say I'm in my dream car
Oh, did I stutter, Harajuku hyphen
Barbie
I'm hot I think its time to put the rice in
I was in the chair, I was gluin' my weave in

I got banana dick, your bitch go apeshit if she hit it
Meanwhile, you're too nervous, pervis, that's why you never get service
And me, I caught the preacher's wife workin' 'fore Sunday service
I put my hand up her skirt and then we prayed for a purpose
I baptized her in Jesus name, left her shakin' and squirtin'
Ooh, I shocked the Sunday school and did that shit there on purpose
See, I'm a pervert with purpose that make you question your purpose
Run the Jewels'll arrive at arenas, bunch of blood thirsty hyenas
To get revenge on the kingdoms that killed the dreams of the dreamers
Drank alcohol for the demons, sip lean with all of the schemers
You see he groove with the people, move with the mind of a genius
You see, he workin' the angles so he ain't never an angel
They wanna get you to hang him, well give them fuckers a finger

I'm the shit
Looking at the money like it's mine to get
I'm the shit bitch
Everybody down, throw the pistol and fist
I'm the shit
We looking at the money like it's ours to get
I'm the shit bitch
Everybody live throw the pistol and fist

Welcome to fuckyoupalooze, we bruisin' any who movin'
Who wanna stan' for these douches, you raise a hand and you lose it
I hold the door for old ladies, run into fires and save babies
I went to school in the eighties, taking the train with the crazies
New York, New York is the mothership where I used to smoke dust and shit
Now, I'm crop dustin' fuckers, suck it up and you'll love the shit
No more games, I'm above the shit, butter me up for nothing
I'm taking all of your ducats 'cause I can call when you're bluffing

Who thought the son of Denise would be the leader of people?
When he was your house at Morehouse, slangin' pounds of the reefer
Sat with potential presidents and said the p should be legal as reparations
For what this nation has done to my people
I'm a pervert, a poet, I ain't a saint, and I know it
Been a crook and cooked the books but never shorted no whores
Promoters comp me the Moet, I'm the man and I know it
I'm the shit, bitch, tell me, how could I not show it?

I'm the shit

Trina,"How long before the hate that we hold
Lead us to another Holocaust?
Are we so deep in it that we can't end it?
Stop, hold, ever call it off
It's too clear, nuclear's too near
And the holders of the molotov
Say that ""Revolution's right here, right now""
And they ain't callin' off

Wake up, roll an eighth up
Throw a double finger with a fist
Here at the abyss
I will be your tour guide
It is war time, check your wrists (Ready, kids?)
Over to your right, shine a light
Got a bevy ready for the fight
I just wanna live, I don't wanna ever have to load a clip
Only hunt bliss
I am still a kid in my heart
But these motherfuckers sick
They don't give a shit, not at all
They don't even want to let you take a little piss in a pot
Listen along
They don't want your love, shit is bugged
Motherfuckers steady getting rich from the blood
Love when you beg
Trust, I would sooner put a puckered pair of lips to the sun
Love will survive
Run out under iridescent lights for our lives
I will be surprised if we ever got the feeling so alive as tonight
Wild for the night
Look into my eyes
I am standing at your side for the fight
Minds over might
Swear to God
They could barely even see the dog
They don't see the size of the fight

Wake up
Drink water
Smoke blunt
Clean, oil my Kalashnikov
Stockpile ten for me and friends in case shit get to poppin' off
The evening news givin' yous views
Telling you to pick your master for president
Been behind the curtain, seen the devil workin'
Came back with some evidence
I'm here to tell you don't let em tell you what's right wrong
Make love, smoke kush, try to laugh hard, and live long
That's the antidote
You defeat the devil when you hold onto hope
'Cause kinfolk life is beautiful
And we ain't gotta die for them other men
And I refuse to kill another human being
In the name of a government
'Cause I don't study war no more
I don't hate the poor no more
Gettin' more ain't what's more
Only thing more is the love
So when you see me
Please greet me with a heart full
And a pound and a hug

Save my swollen heart
Bring me home from the dark
Take me up, take me up, take me up
Take me up, take me up, take me up

Up, up, up
Up, up
Up, up, up, up, up, up

Seen the devil give a sermon in the church
Seen an angel dancing in the club
Tryin' to feed a baby so I threw a thousand in the air
And blessed her with a hug
I done been down so many times
Walked on like a dirty rug
And now that I made it, can't fake it
Gotta give me what I'm truly worthy of
(Worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy)

And I don't how much it really means to be right
(Means to be right, means to be right)
And what a joy it'd be to see some peace in this life
(Peace in this life, peace in this life)
And it occurs to me that maybe we ain't even really seein' it right
Here in the dark
Hoping just to see a beam of the light
(Beam of the light, beam of the light)

Save my swollen heart
Bring me home from the dark
Take me up, take me up, take me up
Take me up, take me up, take me up",2100,2017

Your swagg on point and you keep it coming right back
When you text I right back, yeah right back
I know you like that, that's why I handle that
Bedroom lights off, we kissin slow to a track
It ain't even bout the sex, I crave the gangsta way you act
When you all up in that, you so smooth with it
That's why I never hesitate to say ""daddy come and get it""
I got my Vicky's on and my Diamond Princess perfume
I can't help but think about the thing we do up in the room

The way that you would call
Beating up your pussy, knocking pictures off the wall
In the studio thinking to myself, ""I got one song left, and I'm coming home to you""
Love it when I hit you from the back and you look back at me
Our sex attractive like metal to a magnet
Turn that T.I. On, that's her shit right there
Get drunk, now she hollering, ""that's her dick right there""
I send this off to the ladies who had my head grown
A pretty black girl, a couple red bones
I guess we learn from each other cause we're stepping-stones
With kids now like ""damn, that's how it is now""

Do I put you on a shelf and dust you with care
Do I hide you in a closet or shut you in a drawer

Hear my humble cry
While the others Thou are calling
Do not pass me by

I've got the feelin' and the feelin's not the same
I did the hip hop, a little Hammer and the James
But a touch, a touch from up above
And I get the feelin', the feelin' of Your love

Reachin' out, callin' for Your people
(Reachin' out)
To keep us all safe from a world that's full of evil
Tryin', cryin', Lord, sometimes I'm cryin
When I think of His gifts and the world just keeps denying

When I think of His goodness
And what He's done for me
My soul cries, Hallelujah
Thanks for savin' me, sing

Savior, Savior, why don't You
Hear my humble cry
While the others Thou are calling
Do not pass me by

I don't want the Lord to pass me by
I don't want the Lord to pass me by
I don't want the Lord to pass me by
I don't want the Lord to pass me by
I don't want the Lord to pass me by
I don't want the Lord to pass me by

I know you need Him

'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before 
Between the two of us guys 
You know I loved you more
It took me by surprise I must say 
When I found out yesterday 
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh I'm just about to lose my mind
 
Honey, honey yeah.
I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine baby
 
I know a man ain't supposed to cry 
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself 
That you loved some one else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
 
Honey, honey yeah
I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
 
People say believe half of what you see
Son and none of what you hear
But I can't help but be confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?

Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah
I heard it through the grapevine 
I'm just about to love my mind

I heard it through the grapevine,
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah",I Heard It Through the Grapevine,2007
Trini Lopez,"
If I had told her that I loved her
She would have stayed til who knows when,
but I guess she couldn't understand it
when I said I wanna be your friend,
because a friend would never doubt you 
or ever put you uptight, 
and now I wonder what she's doing tonight.
oh yes I wonder what she's doing tonight?
oh I wonder what she's doing to night?
 
We were so close but we should've been closer
and it's making me feel so sad
but I tell myself I didn't lose her
'cause you can't lose a friend you never had
because a friend won't say it's over 
and got out just for spite.
and now I wonder what she's doing tonight,
oh yes I wonder what she's doing tonight?
oh I wonder what she's doing to night?
 
A friend will always be there 
if you're wrong or if your right,
and now I wonder what she's doing tonight
oh yes I wonder what she's doing tonight?
oh I wonder what she's doing tonight?

Trinidad & Tobago Showboat Orchestra,"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet

Through the broken glass, through the sands of time,
Take a look in my eyes,
You'll see a love that's blind.

Your words don't mean much to me anymore, 
Once they were all to a heart so pure,
Once they held dreams,
And they carried me away,
Like a rose on water

Like a rose on water,
Like a rose on water.

Take a walk through my heart,
Where a rose should be there's a crown of thorns,
From the cry of a child,
There's a woman born.

My touch doesn't mean that much to you anymore,
I'm reaching out for you but I can't be sure,
Am I slipping through your hands?
Or are you throwing me away?
Like a rose on water

Be my shelter from the rain,
Free the child again,

And the petals fall?

You know what I'm 'bout

Yo Silkk ask Trina can she wobble that thing...

Where my niggas yo?
Where my ladies yo?

Who you know could give it to you until you fall out
When you wake up - go by the mall out
Hop on the plane sperm or nothing never thawed out
Have her saying my name like destiny's child
'Cause I go all out
Speaking more sex than money so talk with your tongue out
And sex unbelievable, plus the money never run out
I'm a thug so I walk the street with my gun out
Top up when the sun set, top down when the sun out
Oh you want me, pushing up your number on the slick
Try to make the scene when I was in front of the click
How bout I pull the thongs off in the summer and shit
Laughing at my joke when it wasn't even funny and shit
She need a t-mac ms shaq she think that I ball
She know I'm a real nigga, plus she love that I'm tall
Checks again when she missed the phone, thinking I called
She want to fall for me look, but she think I'm a dog

Need somebody with some doe
That's cool
Who gon' keep it on the low

Who gon' do you right

You want to fuck that's cool but you gotta be the greatest
Take me the Prada, buy my the latest
Try it on the jet, fly me to Vegas
The baddest bitch can't nann hoe fade this
Paid bitch, in a gray six, made bitch
Blinging about 10 karats in the bracelet
Face it stick your tongue out I let you taste it
And if you broke when you see me nigga don't say shit
Cause I'm looking for a nigga that's filthy rich
Yo name Silkk, that's cool I'm a silky bitch
Lil mama stay shining like cuts in ice
Off glass make you bust three nuts in a night
And when I put it on ya, I hope you can stand it
I need a tune-up daddy is you the mechanic?
'Cause if you coming at me right with the real cash
You can play with me all night like Dreamcast

They knew wut you gettin' in life

See I'm a real ass chick I'm a stay by your side
And when its time to ride for my man, I'm a ride

Not cook, clean or nothing cause I got maids for that

Just treat me how you want to be treated
'Cause if I suck it and fuck it you gon' beat it and eat it

So I gots to put it on ya, have ya acting all silly
Then try to convince yourself that you ain't catching feelings
I need a girl who bout it and know how to hit it
You ain't gotta scheme on the doe,
'Cause if ya cards right, you gon get it
Some chicks ain't real though, (some niggas'll stunt)
I know what a woman need, (i know what a nigga want)
So keep it tight, and fuck the world
And who ever end up with me, that's one lucky girl

While there are others living about us, never molested, though in the wrong
When death has come and taken our loved ones, it leaves our home so lonely and dreary
Then do we wonder why others prosper living so wicked year after year

Cheer up, my brother; live in the sunshine, we'll understand it all by and by

Last night as I lay on the boxcar
Just waiting for a train to pass by
What will become of the hobo
Whenever his time comes to die

There's a Master up yonder in heaven
Got a place that we might call our home
Will we have to work for a living
Or can we continue to roam

Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride

Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies hidden up there

Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride

Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies hidden up there

Hard enough, hard enough
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough

Love you don't see
The pain in me
That's plain enough, plain enough
You're never here to catch the tears
I cried for us, I cried for us

I'll take my share but I'll be fair
There's not much stuff
Easy enough
And if you choose I'll break the news
This part is tough, so very tough

I've tried and tried to put aside
The time to talk, but without luck
So I'll just pin this note within your coat
And leave the garden gate unlocked

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
I hear he's gone to some far country
And that he cares no more for me

I wish I were a swallow flying
I'd fly to a high and lonesome place
I'd join the wild birds in their crying
Thinking of you and your sweet face

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
But now the stars have turned against me
And he cares no more for me

Oh when the dark is on the mountain
And all the world has gone to sleep
I will go down to the cold dark waters
And there I'll lay me down and weep

Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me





",My Dear Companion,1987
Trio,"This is how I learned it from a Time-Life Album in about 1958.

There's a little rosewood casket
Lying on a marble stand
And a packet of old love letters
Written by my true love's hand

[Go and bring them to me sister
Read them o'er for me tonight
I have often tried but I could not
For the tears that filled my eyes] I did not know this verse--Thanks!

Last Sunday I saw him walkin'
With a lady by his side,
And I thought I heard him tell her
He would never be his bride.

When I'm dead and in my coffin
And my shroud's around me bound
And my narrow grave is ready
In some lonely churchyard ground.

Take his letters and his locket
Place together o'are my heart
But the golden ring he gave me
From my finger never part



",Rosewood Casket,1987
Trio,"Watching the long faces
Riding this run down track
And the lost places
From a dream that never brings them back
And the sad truth is nothing but a cold hard fact

I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

Counting the burned bridges
Trailing this rusted wreck
As our back pages
Scatter in the dust we left
Like a pearl necklace
Fallen from around your neck

I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

Away down the low road
A ticket to an empty room
A rendezvous unknown

I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

She's a rounder I can tell you that 
She can sing 'em all night, too 
She'll raise hell about the sleep she lost 
But even cowgirls get the blues 

Especially cowgirls, they're the gypsy kind 
And need their laid on 'em loose 
She's lived to see the world turned upside down 
Hitchin' rides out of the blues 

But even cowgirls get the blues sometimes 
Bound to don't know what to do sometimes 
Get this feelin' like she's too far gone 
The only way she's ever been 

Lonely nights are out there on the road 
Motel ceiling stares you down 
There must be safer ways to pay your dues 
But even cowgirls get the blues 

Even cowgirls get the blues sometime 
Bound to don't know what to do sometimes 
Get this feelin' like she's too far gone 
The only way she's ever been

If you knew how I wanted someone to come along

And a siren wails in the night

And how long I've waited for your touch

He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind

The freedom that he sings about
I guess I'll never know
I just can't shake the guilt or kill the pain
But he lets me ride when the lights turns low

Knows that I have to be

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping

Vengo a echar una visteada
A la fiesta de mi rancho
Rebosante de ilusión

A las mujeres bonitas
Traigo flores perfumadas
Y a los charros cumplidores
Traigo mi mejor canción

Hay que bonita es la fiesta del rancho
Donde huele el aire puro a ventana y almidón
Donde un beso sabe a gloria
Debajo de un sombrero ancho
Y nos cobija un sarape corazón con corazón

El jarabe zapateado saca astillas al tablado
Y el mariachi entusiasmado lanza sones sin parar
El palenque se rebosa con la sangre de un tapado
Y una china coquetona busca amores al cantar

Apuéstenle al gallo giro que va contra el colorado
Este gallo nunca pierde pues lo traigo bien calado
Hagan apuestas señores aprovechen la ocasión
Que al cabo a los ganadores no les cobro comisión

Hay que rechulo es el ranchito mío
Donde todo el mundo olvida los pesares y el dolor
Para ver mujeres lindas hay que estar en el bajío
Es gigante la hermosura y cobijo de mi amor

Hay es la fiesta de la tierra mía
Que se alegra con los cantos del mariachi retozón
Y esta linda que se adorna con la clara luz del día
Desbordante de entusiasmo de calor y de emoción

Trio Esperança,"Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

Trio Hugo Dìaz,"Malena canta el tango como ninguna
Y en cada verso pone su corazón
Al yuyo de suburbio su voz perfuma

Malena tiene penas de bandoneón
Tal vez allá en la infancia su voz de alondra

Tomo ese tono oscuro de callejón
O acaso aquel romance que solo nombra
Cuando se pone triste con el alcohol

Malena canta el tango con voz de sombra
Malena tiene pena de bandoneón

Tu canción tiene el frío
Del último encuentro
Tu canción se hace amarga
En la sal del recuerdo

Yo no sé si tu voz es la flor de una pena
Solo sé que al rumor de tus tangos, Malena

Te siento más buena
Más buena que yo

Tus tangos son criaturas abandonadas
Que cruzan sobre el barro del callejón
Cuando todas las puertas están cerradas
Y ladran los fantasmas de la canción

Malena canta el tango con voz quebrada
Malena tiene pena de bandoneón

Trio Hugo Dìaz,"San Juan y boedo antigua  y todo el cielo
Pompeya y más allá la inundación
Tu melena de novia en el recuerdo
Y tu nombre florando en el adiós

La esquina del herrero, barro y pampa
Tu casa, tu vereda y el zanjón
Y un perfume de yuyos y de alfalfa
Que me llena de nuevo el corazón

Sur, paredón y después
Sur, una luz de almacén
Ya nunca me verás cómo me vieras
Recostado en la vidriera y esperándote

Ya nunca alumbraré con las estrellas
Nuestra marcha sin querellas
Por las noches de Pompeya

Las calles y las lunas suburbanas
Y mi amor y tu ventana
Todo ha muerto, ya lo sé

San Juan y boedo antiguo, cielo perdido
Pompeya y al llegar al terraplén
Tus veinte años temblando de cariño
Bajo el beso que entonces te robé

Nostalgias de las cosas que han pasado
Arena que la vida se llevó
Pesadumbre de barrios que han cambiado
Y amargura del sueño que murió

Trio of Doom,"Was it bitter then, with our backs against the wall?
Were we better men, then we'd ever been before?
Say if she came again today, would you still answer to the call?
Tell the truth my friend, don't it matter anymore?

We were simple men by her side when she was born
Talking about the dream
It was simple then, like the freedom when you fall
And we were smaller then you see, but soon we gathered like a storm
They don't understand what that thunder meant at all

Was he crucified, was he done in by the law?
Are you satisfied that he'll never ride again?
Some people say, 'He got away"", they say, ""He never died at all""
If that story's true, does it bother you my friend

Was it bitter then, with our backs against the wall?
Say 2000 years ago
Were we better men, then we'd ever been before?
Well 200 yeras ago
Say if she came again today, would you still answer to the call?
Or tomorrow
Tell the truth my friend, don't it matter anymore?

Trio Pagão,"Nestes verso tão singelo
Minha bela, meu amor
Pra você quero contar
O meu sofre e a minha dor
Eu sou que nem sabiá
Quando canta é só tristeza
Desde o gaio onde ele está

Nesta viola eu canto e gemo de verdade
Cada toada representa uma saudade

Eu nasci naquela serra
Num ranchinho beira chão
Tudo cheio de buraco
Donde a lua fai clarão
Quando chega a madrugada
Lá no mato a passarada
Principia um baruião

Nesta viola eu canto e gemo de verdade
Cada toada representa uma saudade

Vou parar com a minha viola já não posso mai cantar,
Pois o jeca quando canta tem vontade de chorar
O choro que vai caindo
Devagá se sumindo, como as água vão pro mar",Tristeza do Jeca,1994
Trio Pagão,"Cada vez que me alembro
Do amigo Chico Mineiro
Das viage que nois fazia
Era ele meu companheiro

Sinto uma tristeza
Uma vontade de chorar
Alembrando daqueles tempos
Que não mais há de voltar

Apesar de eu ser patrão
Eu tinha no coração
O amigo Chico Mineiro
Caboclo bom decidido
Na viola era dolorido e era o peão dos boiadeiro

Hoje porém com tristeza
Recordando das proeza
Da nossa viage motin

Viajemo mais de dez anos
Vendendo boiada e comprando
Por esse rincão sem fim

Caboclo de nada temia
Mas porém, chegou um dia
Que Chico apartou-se de mim

Fizemos a última viagem
Foi lá pro sertão de Goiás
Fui eu e o Chico Mineiro
Também foi o capataz

Viajamos muitos dias
Pra chegar em Ouro Fino
Aonde nós passemo a noite
Numa festa do Divino

A festa tava tão boa
Mas antes não tivesse ido
O Chico foi baleado
Por um homem desconhecido

Larguei de comprar boiada
Mataram meu companheiro
Acabou-se o som da viola
Acabou-se o Chico Mineiro

Despois daquela tragédia
Fiquei mais aborrecido
Não sabia da nossa amizade
Porque nois dois era unido

Quando vi seu documento
Me cortou meu coração
Vim saber que o Chico Mineiro
Era meu legítimo irmão",Chico Mineiro,1994

E que não demora meu pranto rolar

Vivo inventando paixões pra fugir da saudade
Mas depois da cama a realidade
É só sua ausência doendo demais
Dá um vazio no peito, uma coisa ruim
O meu corpo querendo seu corpo em mim
Vou sobrevivendo num mundo sem paz

Ah jeito triste de ter você
Longe dos olhos e dentro do meu coração
Me ensina a te esquecer
Ou venha logo e me tire dessa solidão

I'll get down on you tonight

And you are on my mind 
Winter turns to spring and then

But we're runnin' out of time 
So while we've got each other here 
Let's treat our bodies right 

I want to know exactly what to do, so that 
You'll never get me off of your mind 
Communicate and I'll go under cover, gonna 
Make you come tonight 
Over to my house 

I'm not the type to change your mind 
If you want to take it slow 
No pressure to go all the way 
There are often places we can go 

Anytime is the right time to reveal it, when 
Two people fall as deep as you and me 
I want to know every inch of your body so I 
Can set you spirit free 

I will be the one to love and comfort you 
From now until the day I die 
I will take you places that you only think

Set you free",Get Down,2003

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1996

And miss it each night and day

Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi

A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Your heart is separating for Utopia
But your body isn't ready to choose.

Trip Lee,"Look I don't know what they told you but if it don't match up
With His holy Word then homie they need to back up
Some they pretend like they get Him they twisting facts up
That's why we dig in the scriptures to know the Master
Homie, we have to if we want to get past the
Only thing we know being what we learned from the Pastor
I really hope your listening, my listeners 'cause after
We want to see Him clear like a big screen plasma
Half of the cats I seen they don't really know the Lord
They think my views are extreme, think I'm going overboard
But they ain't read a page of the place where
He's spoken for Himself in the matters, man that's what I be quoting for
Some say He don't exist, nah that don't even make sense
This Earth is masterpiece somebody had to paint this
Forget the big bang, or evolution and face this
He's the King of Kings and author of all creation
Some say He made it then let's it run like a clock
Nah, He controls every soul and every action on the block
If it happened then He watched and it happens on His watch
No surprise in His eyes, no my God's never shocked

I don't know what you heard, I don't know what you heard
I don't know what you heard, hope it matches with the Word
I don't know what you think, I don't know what you think
I don't know what you think, homie time to get it straight

I don't know what you heard, I don't know what you heard
I don't know what you heard, hope it matches with the Word
I don't know what you think, I don't know what you think
I don't know what you think, homie time to get it straight

Wonderful, Counselor, Masterful
This is Jesus Christ, L-O-R-D, all capitals
This is why Trip and I trip after the mass appeal
Of people, who pigeonhole Jesus as a pacifist, whoa!
A prophet with no power in His plasma
Still we preach against the views that Arius profess to have of Him (Look it up!)
Meaning the deifying of Jesus was nothing more than an accident
But the Bible's the proof that refutes and gives us facts on Him
That He was, what His Daddy was Homousia, the God-Man
Sent to save us all that He loves
And set us free from sin and shut it down like it was Attica
Anyone disbelieving this truth may want to back it up or back it up
Because the Son of Man is coming that's what's up and at
His judgment seat is where you will see His holy wrath is just
But God is Love, that don't mean He's weak, hey check His resume
Just 'cause He let's you breath don't mean He won't take His breath away

I don't know what you heard, I don't know what you heard
I don't know what you heard, hope it matches with the Word
I don't know what you think, I don't know what you think
I don't know what you think, homie time to get it straight

I don't know what you heard, I don't know what you heard
I don't know what you heard, hope it matches with the Word
I don't know what you think, I don't know what you think
I don't know what you think, homie time to get it straight

These days in the church, most cats got it twisted
Don't let them fool you on how we posed to live this
For instance, some say to come to Christ for riches
Or maybe your blessing, but my question is what is this?
'Cause that ain't the gospel, that if you put your faith in Him
To come to the Savior, and then you'll rake that paper in?
Face it friends, they made Jesus they holy ATM
Paul would appalled, this gospel would be disgrace to Him
This false gospel strips Him of His flyness
He's more like your servant and less like His Highness
So please don't buy it, that idea is absurd
Jesus said the Christian life can be strife and it's filled with hurt
Look homie I would hate for, cats to get that fake stuff
And never know it's wrong 'cause they won't open a page up
I pray we erase the wrong views and embrace the
Holy Word that testifies to us about the Savior

I don't know what you heard, I don't know what you heard
I don't know what you heard, hope it matches with the Word
I don't know what you think, I don't know what you think
I don't know what you think, homie time to get it straight

I don't know what you heard, I don't know what you heard

Learned to worship money cars
Learned to hate Christians

You ain't thin enough you need diet
You need a psychic everybody does it you should try it

They think that God is old school like a box cut
But I'm sure that His flock's tough
And we can judge what is bug, and live pleasing in 
His sight when the clock's up
I hope we gazing through His lens with eyes
So we can defend what it is when we get they lies
It's on that cash that they fix they mind

Tell em cool it with the mind games
I'm chasing Christ, I'm renewed in my mind frame

We must remove the damaged parts like a tire change

Satan uses media to tempt you and deceive you
He will lead ya leach ya leave ya
So be careful as you navigate thru media
Take heed fo gravity get the best of you
And you find the concrete bench pressin you
Use the word of God to help filter all that
Before you fall into the trap you better fall back

You know what I call that? I call that maturity
Learnin how to fall back so you can live in purity
Learnin how to walk that and saying them you ain't luring me
The media is meeting us with lies but He's curing me (be easy)

And my mind keeps going back it was a trip
Look I was thinkin He ain't know the facts
Probably cause my heart couldn't get a hold of that
He said that I was terminal and that it spread quick
And my whole body was infected I'm desperate
My minds racing at this point I wanna exit
Cause all His tests suggested I be dead quick
But honestly man I really shoulda seen the signs
I was blind no I couldn't read in between the lines
I was numb so I couldn't feel my fever climb
But my whole system was foul (fowl) like comedic lines
No way to treat it fine
I staggered out like I was drinkin wine
I wasn't even tryna think about of my plans for the evenin time
All I could think was I was weak and dyin
I was reminded of the life that I would leave behind
And so

I know it's headed for me soon and I'm terrified
I'm afraid of what's coming and I'm scared to die
But it ain't lookin good for me, now it ain't lookin good for me
I know it's headed for me soon and I'm terrified
I'm afraid of what's coming and I'm scared to die
But it ain't lookin good for me, now it ain't lookin good for me

Now I got home and it hit me in the worst way
I've been sick with this disease since my birthday
I was ridden with symptoms since my first day
Head to toe my whole system in the worst state
I was mentally I'll, I was futilely mind
Darkened in my understanding was a student of crime
Havin eyes couldn't see cause I was truthfully blind
Havin ears couldn't hear but couldn't do any signs
Throat was an open grave, tongue used for the lies
Snake venom under lips which I would use to divide
Had chips on my shoulders was wounded aside
Both my lungs collapsed inhalin 2nd hand pride
Below the waist was just more of the same
Feet swift to shed blood or somethin more was to gain
Man it's bad blood simply pourin through my veins
Can't ignore it anymore, ain't the story the same, I was in pain so

I know it's headed for me soon and I'm terrified
I'm afraid of what's coming and I'm scared to die
But it ain't lookin good for me, now it ain't lookin good for me
I know it's headed for me soon and I'm terrified
I'm afraid of what's coming and I'm scared to die
But it ain't lookin good for me, now it ain't lookin good for me

My whole life been exposed as dark
My disease had my deeds hittin off the mark
But I had loved my illness even from the start
Look everything was a symptom of my broken heart
It pumped corruption to every single part of me
It's pumped death and deception through arteries
My direction was set to invest in reflect n deception
The? n my best n my death wasn't far from me
Cause I tried to beat the symptoms now
It wouldn't matter cause my heart would keep me livin foul
I was helpless and hopeless it's endin now
Unless I get a new heart well this is how
I heard that there were others with the same plight
But there was One begotten Son who can save life
And His heart was so perfect He gave life
My heart of stones been exchanged I've been changed right?

I know it's headed for me soon and I'm terrified
I'm afraid of what's coming and I'm scared to die
But it ain't lookin good for me now it ain't lookin good for me

I was told that God's standard is so high. My broken heart kept me from meetin His standard, so I just kept fallin short over and over and overagain. And there was really nothing I could do, it was not looking good for me. I guess my question for you is, since God's standard is perfection and none of us meet it, how do you plan on getting by? I know how I do, and to be honest I ain't worried about a thang.",Prognosis,2010

Tw-tw-twisted, tw-tw-twisted

Yes sir, back on that thang, reflectin on life an it's happiness mayne,
Since I was born I had what I needed, when I think back ain't been lackin a
Thang. Clothes I got, soda pop, the home I got, the cash in the bank, the
Bros I got, the shows I rock, none of us lacked it was passed from the
King, So many things was on to us, we holdin up on some dough for lunch and
I'd say my grace and then get with the game. Never really thought of his
Mercy flows, never really heard the words before, every good thing is
Comin' down from the Father of Lights like a passionate rain. Yeah tell
Them to get back, yeah how they think they get that, my Father gave me gift
Wrap though He don't have to give jack. We ain't earned a single thing, oh
Homie, don't miss that, He gives because he's merciful now spit that, don't
Get it twisted. Hey yeah some of us are strugglin' they off in hoods, but
Still get mo' than they deserve look all he He does is good, He gives
Freely and He's perfect in His distribution, look, don't get it screwed up
Like you live in (Houston).

Some things that I think are good in life they make me nervous, anything my
Father give me though I know it's perfect, anything I get besides my death
I don't deserve it, used to think that I was good to have cash splurging
(Ooo! ). I was a trap star, sixteen phat car, anything that made me feel
Good was good, that far, kept them bangers with me like I'm good, gon' act
Hard, even kept that green bay too (yeah - Brett Farve). See my whole
Thought of good was out of context, didn't know what good was cause I
Hadn't seen the Son yet, ran around with different girls like it was a
Contest, young and dumb, foolish, too, I was on some nonsense (ooo! ).
Thought it was good that the whole hood heard of me, they thought it was
Good that other hoods wanna murder me, somebody call the cops cause it's an
Emergency, now I know what good is - it's God's love and mercy.

Momma want some more Obama in me
The hood want PAC hip hop
Wanna see the Common in me
And since it's a senseless contradiction
I end up a misfit trying fit in
This ends when I stand up
And see the hands that are standard
Holy is the lamb (Holy is the Lamb)
Now we holding you to man up 'cause we were made
In his image start looking at what you came from.

Right after Adam every atom in our anatomy had to make
Adamant after what Adonai is against
Let me take you back to the tree and Eden,
If you read it you'd see that Eve was deceived,
But Adam's the one who let her eat it (Man up)
Standing leading no, we ain't leading we (Bump that)
Basically little boys with muscles and a mustache!
The femininity, we need a remedy that God made a
100 percent masculinity

We the last, yeah
Where the men at, seems like they all lost,
None of them are on the scene, seems like they died off.
They extinct but my dream is to rise up,
We chasing the prize of the King, the divine boss,
But we fell away, now we ungodly
We lose and we really got the blues like Navi,
I want to celebrate the dudes that's beside me.
Fellas let's elevate, we through with the lies man.

They lie, go ahead say boy get your shine on
If a sucker try to block you get your 9 on
And what I heard you gotta do to be a man now,
Stand up for yourself so I took it in my hands now.
And that's the problem man we busy trying to solve it
All the while we walking dead man somebody bring the coffin, boy drop
Peach fuzz now you think that your a man 'cause you feeling yourself
You need to man up!

Sex and models and tippin' bottles
Pack a pile of excuses right next to your bottle caps 
A Rolodex filled with names that you aim to please
Next to the stack of money buildin' up a heart of greed
Ice on his neck, givin' jokers the cold shoulder 
You drunk off pride plus you loving the hangover
You gotta whole lotta stuff that won't amount to gain 
Life will never make sense because you never made change  

We got it twisted, sick like a fever
Lil' man live to stack dough, Keebler
Man up, get up out of that treehouse
Leave them cookies alone, it's time to eat meat now
Tryna show you a new way to live now
No charge, you can call it a freestyle 
Without Christ you won't know what a man is
You a boy in a man's body like Tom Hanks in Big

Being a man got nothin' to do with age
You can be a boy 'til the day you lay in your grave
None of us behave like the image of who we're made 
'Cause we fallen the ways it's better known as depraved 
Running from responsibility really we crave
The easy way out of places that call us to pull our weight
Man they blowing through every day decisions are made
Responding to the call God's giving 'em from the gate

Man up!
Let the process begin, separate the boys from the men
Man up!
Doesn't matter how you started partner, it's about how you end

Beautiful life inside 
Living, moving, breathing 
So let hope arise 
God knew what he was doing when He gave 
Beautiful, beautiful life 

Dear sister, I hear the place you at 
I know there ain’t nothing easy about going through that 
There’s a baby in your womb 
But you wasn’t trying to do that 
You’d take it all back if you knew that 
But you ain’t have a clue that 
That time with your boyfriend, that late night 
When you thought you was making love that you would make life 
And now it’s feeling unfair 
Man, it ain’t like you ain’t got a life 
Shoot, the time, it really ain’t right 
Can’t quite tell you that I understand your pain 
But I know you shouldn’t feel discouraged and ashamed 
And I know that baby in your stomach ain’t a game 
It’s got a heartbeat 
He’s about to grow a little brain 
He’s dependent on his mama 
God already knows his name 
You’re made in God’s image and that baby is the same 
Give him life 

[Chorus]
 
Let it live 

Brother, I bet you were caught off guard by that seed in her stomach 
So your heart aches hard 
Feeling trapped like prisoners behind those bars 
The hand’s been dealt, but you don’t wanna take those cards 
Homie, stop and think about the choice 
That baby in her womb, she ain’t really got a voice 
So she really needs her daddy to love her and rejoice 
She’s a blessing from the Lord 
She don’t need to be destroyed 
Don’t abandon her mama 
Love her and support her 
She’s in pain now, too 
She needs someone there for her 
But don’t let her hurt you 
Baby girl alive in the womb 
Cause homie, you’ll be looking in her eyes pretty soon 
Hey, don’t get me wrong 
Look, I agree that we should give women rights 
That goes for unborn women, too 
Give them life

[Chorus]

Dear friends, I know this probably hurts
For those of you who wish you would have gave that baby birth,
But it's too late now 'cause you're child ain't around
I know it hurts to your core, that guilt that's weighing you down
But I've got good news and some healing for your hurts
Christ Jesus came
He descended to the Earth
But he ain't come for good people, or even the just
He came into the world just for sinners like us
So yeah, he's really grieved when we take a baby's life
'Cause he made 'em, but he came to save us from our plight
He came shining light that he could save us from our night
Erases all our shame, homie
He can make us right
Confess it and believe in the one who paid the cost
He died in your place
There's forgiveness at the cross
So you could give them life

""William you come and get me I can take away the pain
Come a little closer you got everything to gain""
But I got too much to lose I'm bout to go insane
I been here too many times got my head low
If I gave a dime for every time I'd be dead broke
I feel that battle in my soul the pressure closing in
My passions asking for it passing I can't hold it in
There I go again no self control again I'm too good at giving in
Feeling like throwing in the towel the guilt is closing in
Sometimes I climb the heights but I'm at my lowest sin
Cloaked in deception and overdosing on potent sin
I'm so gone baby wanna be home again
Wanna feel whole again come feel this hole again
Now I'm doubled over with my face in my knees
And decide it's where I wanna be
But there I go again I'm falling

Face to the pavement
Once again faced with the same sin
(There I go again I'm falling)
I don't think I'ma make it
Don't know how much longer I can take it
(There I go again I'm falling)
So I I'm caught up in this sin
I wonder if I see Your face again
(There I go again I'm falling)
Falling, falling, falling
There I go

Trying to keep it cool I don't wanna lead em playing
But it's hard to block out everything that she be said
Look like keep coming baby just reach out an take my hand
There's no need to feel me all I wanna do is dance
I believe the lie now I'm headed for a door
They have finally got me locked and I'm bout to be the song
Feeling like I'm watched by everybody in the room
Cause they know Imma fake and if not they will soon
Have you ever felt like the walls finna close in
Shackles on your hands and your feet and your dozing
Sleep til the larger key possessed before all of the mess
Sound so beheaded mess with the rest what's left
Is a schizophrenic still where a man once was
Now you get to see the damage your lust does
So now I'm doubled over with my face in my knees
And decide it's where I wanna be
But there I go again I'm falling

[Chorus]

Every time I fall He go 'n pick me up
The Lord is my shepherd homie He go 'n pick me up
I fell into the trap again but He go 'n pick me up
Remind me of His promises in Him I put my trust
I don't never have to give in to the lies
I'm feasting on His word all my sin I do despise
So now I'm down before His throne praying on my knees
Asking Lord give me grace please
I don't wanna be falling

So I gotta face this but I know there's nothing that He can't fix
(I don't wanna be falling)
Looking to the cross where they place Him
Cause I know His grace is amazing
(I don't wanna be falling)
He's covered all my sin

Well, welcome to the good life with it's real joy
Let it's old life seems like a killjoy
It's ironic that the life giver was killed, boy
He rose and He chose me, you know we feel surreal void
We were made to be connected to the life giver

They separate us from the good, we despise scripture

Babe, your more than antidote to lonely days
You're my partner, you got my back with no delays
You don't just hold me down, you help me behold his ways

To choose and chill with my wife over trying to sleep at night

They say that boy insane. He gone he lost his brain
He too zealous, he's just trying to go against the grain
He's got his whole life ahead of him, so this is strange
But they don't get that getting other chicks just isn't gain
And marriage is a pain, in fact it's love and joy.
God's plan for man and woman they wanna destroy
By acting like it's prison, avoid it cause it's hard
Look honestly if it don't hurt than you ain't loving hard
Look at Jesus on the cross he got a ton of scars
Laid his life down for his bride cause his love is large
My Lord he set the bar high, and I'm falling short
But I'll be standing with my Savior when I'm called in court
So please forgive me baby when I don't love you right
You're so patient with me girl because He's in your sights.
So let's take on the world, let's love em hand in hand
Bye bye to boyish ways, hello to family man.

We prayed our wildest dreams his will be done we said.
So let's be praying bracing ourselves for what comes ahead.
We pleaded with the Lord that he would give a child
And he graciously gave, though it took a while.
That is a precious little soul. One who lives and moves.
Never forget the way you smile when you broke the news
And now your belly's growing, baby your skin is glowing
I already love him I can't wait to get to know him.
Till then I'm praying for him, that Jesus would sustain
Our little baby protect him so his life remains.
Through all the joys and pains, you know your husband's here
We'll run this race together. Let's get this one thing clear
I'll never leave your side, I wasn't playing with you
When I wrote them vows, baby girl I'm staying with you
And there ain't nothing that can separate us in this life
Can't nothing ever separate us from the love of Christ

For ever ever ever
The Lord gon be with us for ever ever ever
So girl I ain't gon leave you ever ever ever
The Lord gon be with us for ever forever ever
So girl I ain't gon leave you ever ever ever
The Lord gon be with us for ever ever ever
So girl I ain't gon leave you ever ever ever

I don't know, I used to like Trip Lee when he first came out
Now I'm feelin' like he be actin' like money is a sin or something
I don't know, what he talkin' 'bout now?

Let me get this off my chest, I know some folks gon' be mad
Ain't tryna start no mess, but I know how folks gon' react
Feel I gotta strive and press, tell 'em what I mean till they see that
They think I got a problem, with dollars, and makin' green cash
But money really ain't the problem, every grand is a grant from the Father
When I said we can't serve both God and cash many folks thought I meant ""Don't bother""
But I ain't sayin' makin' money ain't right, I'm just sayin' that your money ain't Christ
Please don't bow down to the greenback and let them stacks rule your life
Ain't tryna say you shouldn't get paid, I ain't tryna say that we should stay broke
But money don't mean you got favor, bein' broke don't mean that you don't
Money is a gift that's good, give it to the Father, to the giver
I've been misunderstood but I trust in the God who deliver

Please don't miss the problem, mayne it is not the God who reigns
It is not the gifts He gave, this is what I gotta say, say
Don't exalt them over the God we praise
You can't really enjoy Him till your heart's replaced
The gifts and the Giver of good
The gifts and the Giver of good
The gifts and the Giver of good
Your heart is where the problem's at, let's get that understood

I got something on my mind, bro some folks might not like that
Feel like it's about that time to hit 'em with the Truth where that light's at
But still some folks wanna fight that, 'cause hand that feeds wanna bite that
'Cause they think it's pleasin', it's makin' demons of all that He made but despite that
He grants good gifts like sex, I ain't tryna start no messin'
I don't wanna get graphic with all the fact cause He gave it so we could be blessed
Please don't, act like I'm gone, please don't, just say I'm wrong, just stay
Confident in the Word, you'll see, that He condones it
Sex ain't the problem, it's sinners who just forgot Him
Distortin', corrupt like Soddom, the gifts, they want 'em without Him
It's beautiful in it's proper place, marriage, until we pop it up
And turn our footsteps from His face, and then we problem

[Chorus]

(You gotta explain)
Last, verse still gotta be real, submit my thoughts under His will
Even if it ain't really what I feel, gotta let Him take that, take that wheel
Last thing to talk about, before end of discussion
I heard power corrupts, no it just shows our corruption
But power's really a blessing, to meet it, to resurrection
And build it to help this mess up, of world in which we're restin', mayne
Our heart's the issue so submit it to the good Lord
He will replace it, what you think we call Him good for?

OK, OK, I think I got what he talkin' 'bout now

I'm good take all my money
I'm good here come the pain
I'm good ya they can kill me
I'm good to die is gain
I'm good I ain't insane yet we don't feel any pain
I'm the same you can't take us out the game
Cause homie we good

I done been through the fire I survived all the floods
And them writers is with me they all covered in blood
Drag my name through the mud they can hate they can gossip 
But my passion for Jesus they ain't never go'n stop me
I was dead I guess that made me better than I ever was
Look at me I'm good partner I'm on my forever buzz 
If everything I have is taken I can take it
They say I never make it I know the person who made it 
My life is hidden in Him so when I die I gain
And Jesus really be walking with me so how I'm lame?
My life is full of pain problems and such 
But I'm focused on forever in eternity's touch
While the world try to fight me Pharisees try to stone me
I am Tebow in the fourth quarter they can't hold me 
Ya the Lord is my coach got me off in the zone
Tell my mama that I'm good when he carry me home 

[Chorus]

Hey man we been beat down we been persecuted
Beat down and mocked but that ain't go'n stop us
No sir. We good. We know where our eternal resting place is at!
Hey trip talk to em man.

I know that Imma suffer that will only make me tougher 
Death is just a doorway to take me to my faithful lover 
The lover of my soul is with me you can save me brother
But you can never knock me down and take me under bring the thunder 
Let the storms come to hunt us and hurt us 
They can't take our Lord from us bro we got us a verdict Not Guilty
He's with us and He stays present He never leaves me
He even gives me stage presence 

[Chorus]",I'm Good,2011
Trip Lee,"Yessir, you know who this is

This is iLove
Yeah you know woman iLove

Yeah, my girlfriend's name starts with an ""I""
Shines bright like stars in the sky
Stays by my side, when it's dark she the light
She befriends many and we get lost in her eyes
Starin' at her, 'stead of watchin' our steps
Run toward her when we wake without catchin' our breath
She's addictin', the truth, we're fiends
And we ain't sniffin' glue, we're just glued to the screen
She rules us, she the proof with your rings
Probably take two of her over two human beings
Her sisters, some bigger, some smaller
Stickin' with 'em daily to keep her in order
Get her when she drops even if we can't afford her
Ask me if I really need her, I be like ""sorta""
But when I seen her at the mall, head to quarter
I keep her in accessories, your boy do spoil her
I want her in my life, I'd do anything for her
Forget about a dime, boy she more like a quarter
With her all the time and ain't nobody cooler
See her a lil' jealous man, and I don't wanna lose her
So instead of spendin' time with others
She only let's me talk when I talk through her

But iLove
But still I, still I, iLove, I love her
I love her so much, I don't need nobody else
Try to put her down but can't help myself
ILove
Come on, you know woman, iLove, I love her
I love her so much, I don't need nobody else
Try to put her down but can't help myself

She's really affectin' how my life goes
She controls me, I might go, psycho
I can't think now, mental light bowl
Wady thoughts are pushed out by her light shows
Communities gotta take a back seat
I tried to talk to others but I'm feelin' mad weak
'Cause I was something I could laugh at, something I could look up
She keeps me entertained until I barely ever look up
And when I tried to get up in the text
She's tappin' on my shoulder, like ""Read another text""
Look, I thought she really be the best
I told her she a heavy ball and chain 'round my neck
She got mad like, ""You got a better date? ""
I had to man up, time to regulate
Look, I told her if she ain't gon' let me meditate
Then for my sake, we gotta separate
Don't wanna hurt her, I don't wanna abuse her
But she's only there for me to use her

ILove
You know who this is, iLove, I love her
I love her so much, I don't need nobody else
Try to put her down but can't help myself
ILove
You know who this is, iLove
I love her so much, I don't need nobody else
But I gotta put her down just to help myself",iLove,2011
Trip Lee,"I wanna introduce y'all to a friend of mine
A lot of y'all don't know him
But maybe you'll understand if he talks to you

Good evening, it's me, yeah it sounds so strange
May not know me but I am a household name
Since I came I ain't never been without no fame
Always grab attention, mayne without no strain
Yeah you heard of me, maybe I slipped out your brain
Some they really love me, no doubt, no vain
Others think I'm whack like ""he sounds so lame""
Some are somewhere in the middle like when altos sing
But yup, you might find me fresh of the presses
Dressed in the best, love I can't spare to reckon
Lives over lives, I'm direct with a message
Incapable of lies, come correct when I step in
Known to change lives, yeah my rep is impressive
Some don't really get me, 'cause I am hard to see
I've split up some families, I'm known to cause wreckage
Some don't really get me, they say I'm hard to read

[Chorus]
Know me
Know me, Know
Know me
Know me, Know

Ey, I'm so old school but I'm relevant to new
In the league of my own, known for tellin' them the Truth
I know fakes that oppose, but I'm tellin' 'em to move
'Cause they ain't on my level like my elevator move
They try to hang it, compete it with out brain
But they just ain't the same, they miss, they playin' games
I got Truth that they missin', 'bout what they can't obtain
Thay facin' that real, one day they will be ashamed
No challenges can harm me, I'm battlin' the storm
I know folks that got my quotes tatted on they arms
But they missin' the point, from Atlanta to the Bronx
If they lives don't change then they battles ain't in form
I get you gotta speak on matters that'll form
The way you see the world from your calories to porn
If you hear me but never change, better be alarmed
I need doer, it's not hearers, it's just the norm, Let's go

[Chorus]

Hey throughout my lifetime, I done seen a lot of folks
Been around the world but ain't seen a lot of hope
And I came to help if they believed in what I spoke
Most ain't listen very well, they just read a lot of quotes
Been used and abused by most of families
Some dudes in them pews, please don't remind me
The views that they choose, really don't define me
Look, I just wanna be understood
Hey, I'm a great storyteller and a beast of a poet
A master historian, esteemed by the coldest
And all of this is centered around He's who they notice
But didn't recognize as the King who controls it
The most high up, and I'm so inspired
By you moved, created everything, done triumph
I take it, He's a lover plus a known fighter
But I can't take credit 'cause I got a ghost writer

You ain't caught it yet?
I'm talkin' 'bout the Word
Yeah, and if you don't know Him you need to
Study His ways and they will keep you from evil

Trip Lee,"Lord Jesus, I just want to praise you for your love
And the way that you displayed your love
And that you died for us while we were yet sinners
I'm amazed

Lord, I'm so amazed at the way you show your love to us
That you ain't stop us in ? that you would come to us
We sin so much, that feeling 'came numb to us
Our hearts lied to us, Lord
Please come school us
While we pursued fake treasure like a dumb jeweler
You planned to redeem man
You would come scoop us
Who is man that you would notice us?
God, mold us
It's pure grace that you would even rest your eyes on us
Much less leave the heavens, come and die for us
Humbled to the point of death
You would cry for us
Bloody sweat
No rest, you would ride for us
Took blows, you gave flesh
You were my donor
Eternally merciful, never bi-polar
You pitied me
Took the weight right off of my shoulders
Stood in my place
Erased the death in us
You showed your love and died while we were yet sinners

[Chorus]
Nothing in my hands I bring
Simply to the cross I cling
And ever since the nails went bang!
All you people respond and sing
Hallelujah
You put your love on it
You put your love on display
Hallelujah
You put your love on it
You put your love on display

There was nothin' 'bout me that moved you to love
I was born unclean in a pool of blood
Then you said, ""Live""
You really proved your love
Christ took my death
My noose has loosened up
You saw me full of sin and full of lust, rage
You hated my sin because of all your just ways
But you pitied me
Showered me with much grace
I read the good news printed on the front page
The headline read ""Christ for my lust paid,
For my sin died, now He was just raised""
And the way I knew the grace from you was real sweet
Is that you came and died while I was still weak
What compassion you showed
Displayed your great love with actions
Yeah, the facts in the scroll
Now I'm like a dirty burlap sack full of gold
You put treasure in the clay pot
I'm amped to behold

[Chorus]

You put your love on display ever since the day you came
Now the only thing to say is hallelujah

[Chorus]",Love on Display,2011
Trip Lee,"I was taught that living the good life meant getting everything I could
But I've been shown a brand new picture of the good life, and it's glorious

Aye I was raised in that lone star state where we go hard
Can't do it small at all, 'cause big things our state
My dreams as a buck was to make a large bank
Daddy told me be the best, no one can tell me I can't
Be the best baller, or be the best rapper
Got a little older, and went after the latter
Grind until I shine, trying to climb that ladder
Grab a couple girls, 'cause your boy looked dapper

But at a young age, I saw I had it wrong
Full of drive, but moving in reverse all along
Dreams full of pride, heart full of stone
You know I had to redefine what I grind on
Success is dangerous if you don't do it right
He gave us everything for pointing to him right
So toast to the king who gave me some new dreams
Everything for his name, that's how I do things

[Chorus]
Never knew how lost I was 'till I found out
That I couldn't hear his voice, it was drowned out
I was chasing things, selfish dreams
Now I see what he has for me
It's the good life

(Wake up!) I grew up with those doctrines and those angels
When wings get mangled and they rock a broken halo
Success is an idol from Hollywood to Diego
No hablo if you don't speak with the pesos
And their favorite dollar sign is too much
More greed, more lust, more taste, more touch
I had an appetite that ate from the devil's power
With every bite 'cause he would rise
I'm kissing my life goodbye

If I find I have a need this world cannot meet
Then I know this life is a place where my hope should not be
I've been chasing those things that are real fake
This is not a real place, this is a dream state
Functional saviors ain't hip, their a real waste
What's the palace going off of without a major king
Pain, sorrow, and empty treasures
Spite the creator and deem creation simply better

The ward off is a lot of things, but it's really lying
And to the Lord, the good life is really dying
I'm the Lord's procession, so my heart's in the heavens'
True religion in my jeans, now stop guessing

[Chorus]

Even the sun goes down, heroes die eventually
Great careers end in the industry
Empires implode; you may go down in history
But everything will go down eventually
Look, you can stack bread, but you can't stop death
And there will be no comforter for you in that bed

We all get laid out, the games get played out
In a maze headed to the grave, and there's no way out
You can't outlast life, it fades out fast
Death is coming for us all, everything's gonna pass
So look at it from that angle down
My dreams gotta be bigger and greater than that

I was with the persecuted martyrs in Asia
Were living out their dreams, though they was walking in danger
Their dreams were lifting up the heart of the savior
And living in a way that shows that he's all that they wait for
One's stacking up the cake, but one's walking in favor
Living a good life, 'cause they walk with the maker

My dreams are different, you know that I've been changed now
The good life is the life that's been laid down.
The good life
Yeah it's the good life
The good life
Yeah it's the good life",New Dreams,2011

To brag on my king

We brag about him daily ‘cause he runs this thing
Can I do it?
Yes, sir
Can I do it?
Yes, sir

We rep the Lord truly
We heading straight ahead
Man, we ain’t tryin’ to hit no U-y
Man, they can’t do nothing to me
We don’t look like them other dudes do we
We young boys, but we sound mature
Call me Stewie
But this ain’t no baby talk
Say we make them looney tunes
‘Cause they call this crazy talk
Makes them say they may be off
We was blind but we now can see
It’s the Navy talk
My goal’s to rest in him
But this ain’t no lazy walk
My daddy ain’t make me so
But he gave me peace, though
Threw my chains up off of me
I call that my free throw
‘Crae told me to go in
They got your boy on beast mode
I ain’t got no white collar
He made me a priest though
Pray I never fall away
Chasing after pocket change
Used to put my stock in riches
I had to stock exchange
I was just a robot

Spit one for the one six, only him
And one to the one cliques notice him

My penalty
Jesus, my remedy
Relentlessly shepherding lost sheep
Call him Bo Peep

Better believe Imma go hard
Scaring everybody with that lyrical miracle
Biblical theology without an apology
Whenever I get upon that microphone I gotta represent
We ain’t scared o’ ya
What they gonna do?
What, murder us?
What murder does is send a surge of us to go put churches up
True, ain’t no hurtin’ us
Im on that just to martyr
When the church go in LA couldn’t dodge ‘em
Satan try to charge ‘em
Media try to bomb ‘em
Under attack, but we got value pearls couldn’t harbor
Hold up
Give me the mic, bro
Glad to record the immaculate sort than a man couldn’t thwart
Elevating the father with a passionate voice

And I’ll do the same thing
Do the same thing

Without the grace of the Lord that was gave for I
For the sin that I committed should have paid that price
But I didn’t ‘cause the father went and gave the Christ
What love is this to send his own?
To die for sin and take us home?
Got me feelin’ good
Forget my feelings
When you heard a story ‘bout the hero dying for the villain
Kill ‘em with the fast flow
Then I go slow
This one here is urgent
When it comes to God everybody’s got a version
Some are wearing turbans
Others getting virgins
With all of these options, we know he’s for certain
‘Cause ain’t no other God like mine
You gots to admit it
Yeah, I’m fallin’ ‘cuz I’m sinning
Yet his grace is sufficient
Beat the grave
Said it’s finished
Got them unsearchable riches and they deep

Can you dig it?

Trip Lee,"Hey I was born less than human 
I know it sounds crazy 
But I was really born a robot as a baby 
No real life in me, I just played my role 
No self control, I just did what I was told 
I got my first order, I was just a day old 
But I didn't have a chance, cause my heart was way cold 
My heart took the order, it couldn't break the mold 
Sold under bondage and I couldn't take control 
So I was just chilling in my robot clothes 
With my robot friends, and my robot flows 
Living robot ways, cause that's all I know 
Till I heard I could be freed from my robot soul, I'm like

[Chorus]
Why you always trying to control me? 
You are not my boss that's the old me 
Obviously you don't know my style 
I'm not a, I'm not a robot now 
I'm not a, I'm not a, I am not a Robot 
I'm not a, I'm not a Robot now
I'm not a, I'm not a, I am not a Robot 
I'm not a, I'm not a Robot now

The crazy thing is I ain't know I was robot 
So I ain't have a whole lot of plans for me to roll out 
I thought I was unique, I thought I was so hot 
But I was just like them other drones, I was so locked 
Brainwashed, I was listening to lies 
The freedom that I thought I had was really a mirage 
I made my own choices, but it was a disguise 
The only thing I really did was pick a different lie 
So I was still a drone, nothing but a clone 
I only knew the lies cause that's all that I was shown 
But I been remade, my heart is no longer stone 
Where my X-Robots who can sing this song? 
Now I've been remade, I'm no longer hollow 
A real man came, changed everything that I know 
He gave me truth, that's a hard pill to swallow 
He gave me new commands, and he freed me up to follow 

[Chorus]

I am not your robot, I am not a clone 
You are not my puppeteer and I am not a drone 
Got a new master and I follow Him alone 
I want a good life till I'm gone 

Hey world, you know I see your game 
And I don't need your lies, I ain't worried bout a thing 
Hey devil, I know you want me chained 
But you have been defeated, and your power has been drained 
Hey flesh, I know you bear my name 
I know you love the lies, but I'm steady tryna change 
You mighta been confused, but this a new day 
I'm saved now, I ain't gotta do what you say! 
To my friends, who are still on lock down 
Still controlled by their passions, stop now 
He can free everybody from the top down 
If you're freed up, say this with me right now 

I'm not a, I'm not a Robot now 
I'm not a, I'm not a Robot now 
I'm not a, I'm not a, I am not a Robot 
I'm not a, I'm not a Robot now

Trip Lee,"Yeah
Hey I wonder if there is anybody else 
Who is about ready to go home

[Chorus]
I just wanna go where
I'm only breathing your air
Father hear my prayer
Take me there
Take me there
(I wanna see you)
I just wanna see you
Brighter than I'm used to you
Finally see it clear see it
Take me there 
Take me there
Take me there

Yeah.
Tell me have you ever seen a 
Brother so weighted you can tell by his demeanor
That he's really jaded tryna get out this arena
He longs for something greater but they say he's just a dreamer
But he has a treasure that he holds like gold
'Cause he knows something that them boys don't know
Nothing seems funny when his money's so low 
But when he thinks about the place man he really wants to go

That he ain't all obsessed with the cash he can stack 
Because he's looking to the heavens where his master is at
But he does have treasure and he's storing it up
Seems foreign to us, it can't be stolen or rust

So when the cares of this world start weighing on him hard
And he's tired of the bills hes been paying on his car
He can't wait to be embraced by the Lord face to face
So he waits for his reward and he sings:

[Chorus]

Tell me have you ever seen her?
She's sick with a disease and it's really tryna beat her
Its taken all her strength 
She knows that it can't defeat her
'Cause she gon' be with Jesus
She's more than just a dreamer.

Her peace and her joy man it really ain't gone 
It's all because she knows earth really ain't home
And even when she's by herself she really ain't alone
Her Savior's there with her while she's singing this song

She knows sickness might get her
And death might grab her
But she ain't scared of death 'cause she's trusting in the master
Was buried but he rose up a few days after
So death might attack her but death cannot have her

So she tells her family, ""don't worry anymore""
When she's gone from the body she'll be present with the Lord
Her body will be raised, so much glory is in store
He is her reward so she sings

[Chorus]

Hey I don't know about you but I can wait till the day
When I'll be with my Lord and everything is OK
And I'll be just like him so sin won't get in the way
Basking in his glory that's where I want to stay

I place where shadows give way to the real
And circumstances can't change the way that I feel
Joy in my Savior that Satan can't steal 
Because he's been defeated- yeah you know the deal

The Real Good Life
I can't wait please take me soon
Until them I'll be praising in the waiting room
Fighting by his grace
Can't wait to embrace the groom
Until then I'm like:

[Chorus]",Take Me There,2011

This fallen world is fallin’, this building’s ‘bout to blow down
We just goin’ in circles, we don’t get another go ‘round
(It’s goin’ down) What happens when your life is leveled, bro?
A storm is comin’, can’t nobody’s levies hold,
It’s heavy, bro, but I gotta let you know
It’ll help you look beyond this world like a telescope
(It’d be easy) Yeah, stack your money in the air
‘Til it’s rainin’ hund’eds all around your atmosphere
(It’d be easy) You can build a mansion sky high
‘Til can’t nobody see the roof when they drive by
But death’ll hit you like a drive by

The darkness is flowing from my nostrils
We’re so psychotic, we still partyin’ like we not sick

Roll another one up, let’s put on another mask
Another bundle o’ cash, another shorty to bag,
Same thing e’eryday, groundhog under grass
Man, turn the music up cuz I don’t wanna hear the truth
‘Bout the things I’m living fo is dead and I’m the living proof
Shoot, the sky’s fallin’, ain’t no need to panic
Unless we party ‘til it cracks, seeing Jesus standin’
Coming down

You scared, I’m not
There’s a time for everything,
A time to be born and a time to die
There’s a time when the world as we know it will end
When that is, I don’t know
But it is goin’ down

Listen, it’s goin’ down, down, down holla’ “Mayday!”
Them fiends looking for candy and them dealers got that pay day
I seen them child soldiers; they was loading up some AK's
Ain’t playin’ Modern Warfare. Don't you know ain’t a war fair?
Scales are never even, but they be triple beamin’
They keep them fiends fienin’, the Devil stay scheming
And dreamers steady dreamin’, but ain’t no hope here
Ain’t no satisfaction in money, women, and clothes here

Hey, can't some young men say the stuff we gotta say
‘Cause everything is fallen, it could happen any day
Your world come tumbling down and ain’t no way to get away
You ain’t never gon’ say you ain’t hear it from Lecrae

I know I don't deserve to touch the mic bro
But this craft is something that I would fight for
I'm in the lab with this pen and a pad
Knowing I might finish last
That ain't really why I write though

Let's go back in time to '04
I'm in 1-1-6 quickly I was on board
Fast forward four years we on tour
And we ain't notice what He had in store
But now here we are
Ten years later
Flows got greater
Minds got closer
Plus there's more haters
Sayin' we just do it for dough
But they won't break us
Cuz the Lord we serve with the flow
He is so gracious
And if they ask me why I do it
I tell 'em it's the music of a movement
Yeah I'm speaking for my Unashamed crew
That ain't never touched the stage but they walkin' they just doin' this
Rise up

If we all rise up
That'd be my dream

That we should all rise up
And give a standing o' for the King
Cuz He's good

We should all rise up
And give a standing o' for the King
Cuz He's good

We been from bootleg tours
To high quality shows
From 'Crae making beats
To high quality pros

Ridin' in our cars
To sittin' on planes
To tour bus rides
But the mission ain't changed

More fans in the stands
Homie we made it
God ain't more pleased
Cuz radio stations played it

You know I'm prayin'
We stay seekin' his face
So we not disqualified from the race
Race, and my brothers promise me this
If notoriety get the best of me make me quit
Quit

And I promise that I'mma stay
By you and edify you no matter how it gets

And to the fans
Please promise me too
You listen to the words
But leave 'em and go and do
We do it for the Lord
But still we do it for you
They ain't never seen the gospel at work
Show 'em it's true
And rise

If we all rise up
That'd be my dream

We should all rise up

I ain't retired but I thought about it
I feel called to be a pastor I'm all about it
See His glory in His word and I gotta shout it
So I'm just trying to figure out how I can shout the loudest
Plus, I saw its hard to be pastor
When after the service you gotta get out and rap for the masses
I'm feelin' torn in my heart
I had to pray
My health is making it harder to find a way
But if I ever do leave the game
Gotta leave 'em with something with meaning
I proclaim
It don't matter if my name get deleted what remains
Is the mission that he missin' which is liftin' up His name
I read John's vision and it's plain
Christ reigns so I'm stickin' in my lane
Rap don't need me
Reach don't need me
Christ don't need me
I'm limpin' 'cause I'm lame

But I'm carried by the one and only healer
'Bout the transition homie, faith is getting realer
I'm just waiting for my Savior to reveal a
Clearer vision of the only peace, be stiller
I'm filled up in Him
I'm still tucked in Him
Once was lust driven
Now I must trust the Risen
Hey, pray for your brother cuz I know that luck isn't
The way I'mma succed, nothings up to luck is it?
Of course not
Look I ain't done tryna' make a change
I'm just switchin' up the method let me make it plain
Tryna' find my position I ain't forsake the game
And the win is the glory of the greatest Name

Trip Lee,"It's crazy to think about how much stuff has changed now from, you know
We've been rolling together, you know, 
And Lecrae and Tedashii if even longer than me. 
But, for 10 years, you know, I met them dudes in '04 
And been rolling with them ever since and that friendship is deep. 
And one of the things that make that friendship deep 
Is how much we've been through this journey together. 
It's crazy how much stuff has changed, 
I think about the first tour we went on as a record label, 
The first Unashamed Tour and we were incredibly excited 
And we think the Lord used that tour. 
When I look back at it, dang, it was a [?] tour 
We didn't bring no sound. 
We just showed up and played some, whatever they had, 
And played some music and rapped on it 
And to think about how far stuff has come to, now actually crafting our sets. 
Thinking about all of our video stuff and thinking about our lighting, 
And all the stuff that goes into putting on a good show. 
The Lord has brought us so far, 
And we love doing this stuff
And it's crazy to be able to do it at a high level 
And I hope we keep getting better and it keeps 
We keep growing in a way that were able to do it 
And folks appreciate it and are encouraged by it",All Rise Up Interlude,2014

Let me teach you 'bout your time in my coffin now
(Oh) I know you smell it in the air (yeah)
'Cause I been in the grave for too long I swear
People crying, I'm listening
Obituary been written
My face pale, they can't tell
Your boy 'bout to be risen

It's over can't nobody reach him, so so long

Any story homie I was raised up by the Christ
Still dead man walking, Green Mile
Go and check my grave it's been cleaned out
Now come and look into my eyes bro
You can see the fire go and tell 'em I'm alive bro
Full of power like a wire bro
God connected to me like some cables and I'm fired up
Dead men don't talk, dead lies aren't truth, dead men don't walk
So what that means for me is that they signed off
On my death warrant but I was raised boy and dried off

They see me on the stage
They like that boy the man
They hear play on them songs
They clappin' in them stands
They like ""I bet you got a lot of good stuff from other bands""
So when I say it's been a few hard years they think I'm playin'
But you don't know my life boy
You don't know my life boy
You don't know what it's been like on my wife
Don't know my fight boy
Being in the trenches steady tryna' fight my foes
And when I couldn't fight no more it brought me low, low
It brought me low I know can't bet it low

I feel thorns where my crown was

From the dusk until dawn yeah
(I'll survive 'cause I got) sweet victory
Nobody can take it from me sweet victory

They like I here you talkin' wins but I see your losses
You celebratin' crowns but I see your crosses
That's the paradox that don't fit in your Mary box
You might not understand if you walk in this pair of socks
The Victor ain't the one that's winnin' seventh inning
Trophies don't go to the ones that got a good beginning
When I say I win I don't mean the state I'm in
I mean that day when the grace got fade out then
I'm winning 'cause I ran with Him

The crown of thorn
Declares your King
A scarlet robe can't cloak Your majesty
They nailed Your hands
You mailed our death
From the cross You reigned
Your Kingdom knows no end
Oh, Jesus
You won it all
Oh, Jesus
Victorious
Oh, Jesus
You won it all
Oh, Jesus
Victorious
Oh, Jesus",Sweet Victory,2014

(Hey this is for all the dreamers)
Yessir

Woke up in the morning feeling like a million dollars
Hollering, ""Can't nobody stop us, no lie""
I'm up
I'm dreaming 'bout the way I'm 'bout to conquer all the monsters in my way
I'm feeling like I'm on fire
I love, that feeling when you walking in your calling
Ain't no turning back I'm all in, I ain't finished, just watch
I’m up
Probably ain't no ceiling, don't be silly
Ain't no stealing what I'm in cause, homie this is my spot, my spot

Way up in the clouds like I'm on one (Way up, way up)
Way up in the clouds like I’m on (I'm on)
Way up in the clouds like I'm on one (Yessir)
Way up in the clouds like I’m on

Woke up from my sleep and I'm tired
No way I wanna get up, I'm leaving my eyes, like a safe
Then I think of my dreams and I'm wide, awake
It's like a light and a beacon inside of me
To be honest, last year was a blur
I had a dream, but it was deferred
I caught a beating, I'm eating the dirt
Wondering, ""Will the dreams I'm seeking emerge?""
But that's the way dreams go
They hurt before they heal, if you ain't know
They take before they give, casinos
They kill before they live, I seen those
Desires that stay far and away, I seen those
Fires that's never catching a blaze, I seen those
But it's something in my soul
That can't stop running at 100 to the goal

Woke up in the morning feeling like a million dollars

Way up in the clouds like I'm on one
Way up in the clouds like I’m on (I'm on)
Way up in the clouds like I'm on one
Way up in the clouds like I’m on

Guess I need another plan
My other one is covered under sand
Buried like second day Son of Man
I don't understand
Another dream is deferred, and it's a nightmare now
I thought it was destiny, I got fear now
Piecing what's left together, I ain't clear now
No peace in this mess, from Him I gotta hear now, hear now
Cause man, I don't know what's even coming from the sky no more
And what's coming from inside, oh no
Cause I don't feel like I can fly no more
But I can't forget the motto, motto
No more mediocre, just getting by though
I'm in His image, I been down for a minute
But I'm getting up today, and I'ma fight till I'm finished

Trip Lee,"Day has arrived, babies they cried
Wifey been up, 8:35
Smelling the coffee, I wake, then I nod
Wrestle with guilt, am I lazy or not?
Now it's 11, the AM has died
I slept through alarms, my anger is odd
I'm mad, but I'm not, I'm decaying inside
Too numb to be sad, I can't even lie
My heart is a drum, all its playing is, “why?""
The echo is loud, I'm vacant inside
I'm out of my body, I gaze in my eyes
I look like a zombie, say my goodbyes
It's killing my highs, I'm asking my God
To heal me I'm not asking for much
I just wanna say: how long will it be ‘till you take it away?

If you ever wonder
How long you'll be under
The weight is on your shoulders, but it won't be always
I know you losing patience
It's written on your face and
I can see you clearly, but all that I can say is
Just a little while longer, longer, longer
Just a little longer, longer for me

I'm sick of the pain, I'm finna complain
My doctor is lost, man illness is lame
'07 it came, and it's never the same
It's killin my job, it’s been killin my name
My label is mad, and I'm feeling shame
They not hearing back when they call me, and man
My new book overdue, and my brain is a mess
So what I'ma do? 'Cause my publisher's stressed
I'm shepherding too, I keep letting them down
'Cause my body can crash, then I'm never around
Nowhere to be found, but I'm in the bed
That’s for weeks at a time, and it's dead in my head
My wifey she hurt, the pain in her eyes
She tryna be strong, and just take it in stride
But it's wearing her down, and I'm asking today
How long will it be till you take it away?

If you ever wonder
How long you'll be under
The weight is on your shoulders, but it won't be always
I know you losing patience
It's written on your face and
I can see you clearly, but all that I can say

It don't take a lifetime
Waiting on a lifeline

Trip Lee,"Born sinner like Biggie, maybe Cole
If your picture pitch black, you can peer into my soul
Angels probably crying, ain't no penance for my roles
I don't wanna face a sentence, but it's clear I'm getting cold
I try hard, every time I think I'm on the way up
All the wicked stuff I'm plotting makes me stay up
It's like I ain't in control of my soul
Doing good is hard labor, but evil's like a layup
Mama ain't raise me wrong
Partner I ain't popping pistols 'til your brain is blown
Still I know my list of sin is getting way too long
If only God can judge me, what lawyer gon' take me on, take me on

Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord have mercy (I’m a man)

The bomb been dropped, dust ain't cleared
Choppers ring out, drown in fear
It's kill or be killed, roll up or get smoked
Smile in your face, but at each throats, how I know?
He made me a black man, with all black clothes
Black coffee, blacking out on all my flows
But why is black a problem here for all my bros?
And why they trying to put a tag on all our toes?
Black fist on the pick sticking out my fro
He made me black, and put His image on my soul
They thought our fight was finished in 1964
New specifics, same hearts, same issues unfold

Can't wait 'til it’ll change, hold up
Hope my waiting ain't in vain, hold up
But I gotta try and hold up
Can't survive if I can't get with the vibe, hold up
Every single moment, we got demons weighing heavy
Heaven I been waiting on it
Only time we ain't divided's when we groaning
But He died to recruit his main opponents, good morning
Tell them that I’m on the way bruh, chains is on me
And I’mma get there any day bruh, wait up for me

Slide through, buy shoes, no problem cop that
Pay my dues 'til I got that
Childhood wasn't pretty, they give me no love
On the block like I'm Timmy, just tryna post up
Tryna get plenty pennies when I grow up
""Don't nobody make it out of here,"" they told us
I seen rappers end up in the news
Trappers look fresh down to the tennis shoes
I'm like, ""everything they got I want it too

Need a break from these brokers giving stock tips
Some will take what you get if you don't watch it
But they won't kill my high, I'm in this cockpit
Got expensive taste for cheap thrills
I'm humble, but I'm rich, got a ""meek mill""
Might give a girl a ride, call it “free will""
But never take her home twice that's a ""refill""
Yeah, it's sweet deal, but I gotta say
If I was rich at Jay, I'd buy a plane and fly away

A couple bad broads, and a spouse with me still
More money than I count, what a deal

They say I got it all
But I ain't really satisfied, pockets could be fatter, got desires I ain't gratify
I got it all
Yeah I climbed the ladder, I be tired of paparazzi
But at least they give me alibis

I rolled her with a shame 
Robbed her just the same

I rolled her on a date, she sent 
Me to my fate

Trip Shakespeare,"I came from Minnesota with a nail in my head 
I said, ""Trust me"", to a woman that I met

I'm lost today 
At night I'm on a highway 
Racing from the truth 
A nail in my head 

I came to California with a snake in my breast 
I said, ""Trust me"", to resistance that I met 
I held her only temple to the thing in my chest 
I felt lucky when the evening let us rest",The Nail,1990

""Everyday I'm hustlin'""
""Ten years later time for me to cash out""

Now here are some interesting facts about the mastermind,
Which give you an idea of how important it is
And how necessary that you embrace this principal 
And make use of it in attaining success in your chosen occupation

First of all, it is the principal through which you may borrow 
And use the education, the experience, the influence 
And perhaps the capital of other people in carrying out your own plans in life. 
It is the principle through which you can accomplish in one year more 
Than you could accomplish without it in the lifetime 
If you depend entirely upon your own efforts for success

There is no such thing as something for nothing.
Everything, including your personal success, has a price that must be paid
