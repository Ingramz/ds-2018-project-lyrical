Break day on the hottest block wit my niggas
Just cause I (DMX)love my niggas (uh huh)
Chill wit the crew (uh huh)
Real wit the crew
4 million sold, look- still wit the crew
Break bread wit the fam
Till I'm dead wit the fam
Duck cops. Shake feds wit the fam
Flip them pies wit my hustlas (uh huh)
Ride for my hustlas
Die for my, lie for my, cry for my hustlas
Roll wit my duns (uh huh)
Cold wit the guns (uh huh)

Fuck wit them clothes
That's real wit them shoes, keep

While you ho talk that, look for a walk dough
Petty crime niggas
Petty time niggas
Sold petty drugs came up wit petty thugs
Now you got game in you
Wanna be a menace and you got Kane in you
I'll put them thangs in you

You came too deep, one fell niggas

Peep the kid from P-H-I-L-L-Y
North west south west south side
Spit it for them bitches and
Niggas who stay fly
B-Mack, Roc-a-fella till I die
Met Jay, dropped on a album in a week
Without unsigned hype or battle of the beats
The first time niggas heard me
Spit it in the streets
I gave y'all a thousand bars wit Memphis Bleek
Stay strapped, heat in the car under the seat
6 hammers even though we only 3 deep
We clap up niggas
Smack up niggas
Duck tape, rope, and wrap up niggas
Think shit a joke, go head crack up niggas
Get treated like Coke and get capped up niggas
The only thing funny
Is y'all never seen big face money
Till them big face 20s

Jigga (bounce wit it), uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh, yeahh
Let it bump though

It's the hard knock life (uh-huh) for us
It's the hard knock life, for us!
'Steada treated, we get tricked
'Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

From standin' on the corners boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggaz know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggaz with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me mom I rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty/fifty, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter
Nigga Volume 2, y'all niggaz get ready

It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us!
'Steada treated, we get tricked
'Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

I flow for those 'dro'ed out, all my niggaz
Locked down in the ten by fo', controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks, we don't take over we borrow blocks
Burn em down and you can have it back daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see you vision mama, I put my money on the long shots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Now I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot; sleepin' on futons and cots
To king size, green machines, the green fives
I've seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type braile
I'm tight grill with the phony, rappers y'all might feel we homies
I'm like still, y'all don't know me, shit!
I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improving
I'm tryin to murder everything movin', feel me?!

It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us!
'Steada treated, we get tricked
'Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us!
'Steada treated, we get tricked
'Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

I don't how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Gotta a lot of beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustling's still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed, to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it, til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, X'ed your name out
Put Jigga on top, and drop albums non-stop for ya, nigguh!

Jay-Z,"I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you

I’d do a bid, loose a rib, bust a cap, trusting that
Run up to heaven doors, exchange my life for yours
Leave a steak out the door, mi casa, su casa
Just remember to turn the lights off in the hall
My brother from another pop, minus one shot
We Neno and G-Money man, we all we got
From the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops
And us getting mad, throwing rocks off the roof
Straight thuggin' man, I thought we would never progress
But look at us now man, we're young execs
My nigga Dame, my nigga Biggs, my nigga Tah
My nigga Ja, my nigga Gotti
We embody all that’s right with the world
No matter how pretty she is, you never liking my girl
That's how we run, when you ain’t around
I'll spank ya son, keep him in line
If you should die, I’ll keep him like mine
God forbid, keep this in mind, my nigga

I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you

I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you

I know mama, your little baby
But these streets raised me crazy
Product of my environment, nothing can save me
Thanks for letting me bloom for your wisdom for your womb
For the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed
For the most important lesson in life was when you said
""Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them""
Thanks for the days you kept me breathing when my asthma was bad
And my chest was weezin', thanks for the look of love
Just as I was leavin'
On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back
That left you grieving
Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad
As the man, I apologize for my dad
When the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do
That wasn’t the life meant for you
You’re a queen, you deserve the cream
Everything that gleamed, everything that shines
Everything that’s mine

I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you

I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you

Check it out, uh, uh
Dear nephews, I’m writing' this with no pen or a pad
And I’m signing it, ya uncle, ya best friend, and ya dad
Don't look back if you fall and you’re feeling bad
I’m right there from your cut to when you peelin' the scab
If it comes a time when you ain’t feelin' your real dad
Put my face on his body don’t wait for nobody
Don’t follow no nigga, that's ho shit man
Stand on your own two, do your shit man
The world is yours
Some girls are nice some girls are whores
Don't listen to your crew
Do what works for you
Standing back from situations gives you the perfect view
You see the snakes in the grass and you wait on their ass
Bite your tongue for no one and whatever is said
Take it how they want, a closed mouth don't get fed
You know my number when it’s code red if you're wrong my nigga
You’re my nephew, fuck it we get it on my lil nigga",Anything [*],1999

If you a playa, get it now like a playa
Get it down like a playa, spit a round like a playa
If you a playa, roll an ounce like a playa
Get an ounce like a playa, bounce like a playa
If you a playa, get it now like a playa
Get it down like a playa, spit a round like a playa
If you a playa, get an ounce playa, bounce, playa
Bounce, bounce, bounce

When I step in the club, bitches know my name
I don't do a lotta talkin' bitches know my game
Don't gotta buy a lotta drinks bitches know my aim
Y'all get them whores drunk just to get some brain
When the Roc in the place, they go berserk
We make em bounce till they motherfuckin' shoulders hurt
Bitches lift up skirts, take off shirts
Fine babysitters take off work
Lose they jobs, panties, shoes and bras
Niggas mad at us 'cause they lose they wives
I don't step up in the club without a weapon in the club
'Cause niggas get drunk and kick crap up in the club
That's why my tool be cocked, niggas mad 'cause my shoes be blocked
And my jewels be rocked
If you a playa, you wouldn't be in my pocket
If you a playa, you like it, you see it, you cop it

[Chorus]

If you a playa, you got the three basic niggas
Your trick your lick and your dick niggas
The object never fall in love wit 'em
Run to the malls and the clubs for them
If you a playa, then you choose 'em like a playa
Use 'em like a playa,then you lose 'em like a playa
I bet I'll still be they favorite bitch
Some bought me ice, some paid for whips
C'mon you know the rules in this playa shit
Ain't no such thing as a relationship
If you a playa, get it now like a playa, get it down like a playa
Spit a round like a playa
If you a playa, roll an ounce like a playa, get an ounce like a
Playa, bounce like a playa
If you a playa, bounce, bounce like a playa nigga, bounce, bounce

[Chorus]

Jiggaman ya heard?
If you a playa, will you pull up to the curb
Niggas chicks fly the coup when you pull up to them birds
Why the fuck would you bring her
When the rocks on that man got his whole hand lookin' like E-T's finger
If you a playa, keep your cars with the year (year)
Your watch game tight (tight) your hustle over there (uh-huh)
Your house outta sight, your enemies close
And your family tight and never try to make a ho your housewife

Spit what man
Man I don't know where that shit be comin' from dawg for real
Ain't no fuckin' rapper man
Sixteen
I don't know Jay
If you don't believe me then

Who you know who can spit till he pop the real
Never thought about rappin' 'til he coped his deal
I really held down my block for real
All I do is crack rock and how to pop the steel
How to box niggas in where they can barely move
Roll wit straight thugs never scary dudes
Keep bodies on them guns and we share our tools
Deuce one ball for Philly like Larry Hughes
Keep the desert eagle wit the beam tucked by the scrotum
Get locked in jail run a block sell open
Mind went to jail I get dro el's roll 'em
Rookie nigga clippin' niggas like L Odom
I got dough I choose not to spend it
Catch me in Avis and Budget in somethin' rented
Long as the windows tented (I don't give a fuck)
I'm in it 
I was holdin' wit music rollin' in the gold infinite

Can't go inside the game ain't got enough strikes
Come at me wrong I'll come at you the same

Send 'em to one of my custy's and bring a lung back

Now, is my street bitches not into this
Wild loud like my thugs do up in the tunnel
You know the rock ??? itchy finger the tussle

It's Blake on the grape, pouring ya juice, tickle your weight 

Just might be, politely, leave your man to ache 

The guns are dirty? You know I double check the safe 

I take it all, still be the last to escape 

Kick It like Q-Tip, we get it killed for a few chips 

Got a new whip, new house, got a new zip code 

Watch the stroll, little Ace 

A soldier that was born to roll 

I love God and you know I got soul 

To sell around the globe and more Bank than Tower 

Dime just rewind-a, it was hard to find her 

Found out my niggas got right behind her

[Mr. Bristal] 

y'all niggas got dick bricks, scared to grab the fifth 

But I done did that, recognize the clique 

Back round six-four times, fellas and shit 

Make mils off the stories that we tellin' and shit 

'Til I said to myself ""My life is betta than this"" 

I want to party, live it up, pop Don and Cris 

In a lake with a waterproof on my wrist 

Been a professional, now I'm starting to mix 

We rhyme to kick tricks, for kids, I bring it where ya live 

Run up in your crip, tie up your wife and kids 

Send my man out, G, pissed off a ten-year bid 

We live this real street life 

And that's word to B.I.G. (uh) 

I'm the type to analyze ya (what) 

Move swift like Kaiser (uh) 

My appearance surprise ya (yeah) 

About 5'4"", my .45 is live (uh, uh) 

Don't ya get live? Never judge your man by size (uh, yo)

Niggas owe money, yo, niggas can't pay a penny less 

Cease got the squeeze, I'ma let these fuckers know 

BK style, my niggas Love the Dough 

About six hard years, eleven months ago 

We was all puffin' 'dro, nowhere to go 

Now I get dough, get low, let a slug blow 

Cops say ""Got evidence?"" Let the dog go 

Here's the answer, you fucking with Leo Ganza 

Nigga's coke so raw, you gon need a sampler 

Niggas better be as wise as me or die like me 

Or go see the board then and frown like me 

Got niggas takin' pictures throwin' pies on me 

Motherfuckers' All Eyez On Me 

Whatever happened to Brook-lawn? 

Better yet, Crook-lawn? 

Niggas even look wrong, niggas get hooked on 

Picture me making a shook song 

No, I know the wars we took on 

Niggas better get gone 



[Jay Z] 

Yeah, flow sicker on every record 

Watch Sean, glock nine, nigga, heavy necklace 

Watch mine, about to make niggas very jealous 

Ice in every letter, untouchable, can't fuck with duke 

Thug spit, arms shake, who I'm gon play 

With the CEO of the coke on Broadway, huh? 

Never heard so many choices from one man 

I make bitches, fuck it, I make the gun jam 

Flows like sniffin' a hundred grams o' 

Cocaine raw, rip your whole brain off, uh 

Make it real easy to lift your chain off 

BK style (what), see Jay how (uh) 

We don't play fair, we play foul 

Go head, stand there, we spray crowds 

Live from the 7-1-8 

If there ever was one great

I don't think you are
I don't think so!

They got my back against the building
I'm the villian that's creeping around corners
Like shorty you see them niggas creeping around, warn us
We might be coming through, gunning through, running through
So be careful what you do
Or the slugs might come to you
As long as I can remeber, the streets have kept me safe
And ever since that time in December, the heat's been in my waist
I need an extra set of eyes so I keep my dogs with me

I don't know whats wrong with me
But it seems like since you heard of us
Y'all niggas turning into murderers
Couldn't fuck with a third of us
Still against me

Grilling me all crazy when you see me and the L.O.X.
Leave you Red like Foxx
Ain't nothing funny about that

All y'all remember is the part about me parkin the hog
What about all them days I was walkin my dogs?
Barkin at broads, but they never hollered back
And if they did all they said was, ""where dem dollaz at?""
Imagine, bein skinny growin up around broader cats
The quiet assassin demeanor of them college cats
Until I got a gat and loudly start poppin back
Round the way, niggaz called me bobby bouchete

I made it so, you could say marcy and it was all good
I ain't crossover I brought the suburbs to the hood
Made em relate to your struggle, told em bout your hustle
Went on MTV with do-rags, I made them love you
You know normally them people wouldn't be fuckin witchu
Til I made em understand why you do what you do
I expected to hear, ""Jay, if it wasn't for you""
But instead, all I hear is buzzin in your crew
How y'all scheamin, tryin to get accustomed to my moves
So y'all could tape my mouth, stake out my house
But I got pride I'm a nigga first
I gotta cock back and pull the trigger first
That's how jigga work
The funny thing; I represent y'all every time I spit a verse
And that's the shit that hurts

My game change but my mindframe remains the same
I gotta protect what's mine
Shit I started from nothin; zero, zip
I made my way hustlin, I don't owe niggaz shit
I'm paranoid now, so I keep the gun gripped
Cats I played skelly with?  niggaz done flipped
I keep a banger in the ankle, one in the hip
Two in the stash, one come up when I shift
I keep one under the chair where I sit
I even got a gun in the hair in the bun of my bitch
Ask big; everytime he'd come to my crib
He'd find another gun that I hid

There's 'Seven Degrees of Separation' and I'm Kevin Bacon

I don't like playin', niggaz can't stick me
Niggaz cannot jam me, niggaz can't get me
Slimmy at the Rucka wanna leave and spend with me
I consistently take 'em out the park like Ken Griffey

Makes you think about the people in your life
Then I think about BIG, what'd he say if he was here
He'd say, ""Jay, what's it about? What's life about?

If you don't go through as a man's a man""
He'd say, ""Suck it up, take the fall, do the time
That's what makes you who you are, makes you what you are""
How many years you been around this thing of ours?

Commission, 125 years
What's it about?
It's about rules, parameters
You take the beatin' for the friend you don't lay down

You don't betray who you are, what you are
You gotta remember guys like Taj, Chill, Ran, Emory
They don't roar, they don't rap
You know why? That's the rules, you don't break them

You was born to be somethin', I wasn't even supposed to be humble
Okay, so you humble me now, what you got?
You got a war, you got global war
You got a worldwide crime syndicate now

There's no rules, there's no parameters, there's no feelings
There's no feelings for this game
So five, ten years from now
You're gonna wish there was an American Commission

Five ten years from now
They're gonna miss Jay-Z

Jay-Z,"Millenium flow
Serena Altschul's here live outside the criminal courthouse
This is {bullshit} y'all
In New York City for the first day in the trial of 
I'm gone 
The State vs. Shawn Carter, a.k.a. Jay-Z
Uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh
Whatever the verdict in this trial may be
The effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide

Aiyyo, stand forward, 'fore you take notice
Or witness to me killin the track
Testify 'til me spillin the smack
Now they got me for traffickin, racketeerin, audio crack

They call me Dope Man, Dope Man
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man

A broke man, approachin the bench with intent
To bury me under the cell, fingered me as the toast man
Evidence stemmin from ninety-six
They say the world ain't recovered from his fix
While they was usin cut I was on some other shit
Gave it to you raw and they just discovered it
Nowaday, the jury got they brow raised
Listenin to testimony about my foul ways
Exhibit A: ""Reasonable Doubt""
They say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out

You can feel the tension building here
As an unprecedented number of people have turned out
For what may be the ""Trial of the Century""

They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man

How come, you label your brand of dope
""Volume 1"" and spread it through the slums?
Fed it to the young with total disregard
Your honor, the State seeks the maximum charge
And how could you, turn right around
And release a lethal dosage called ""Volume 2""
And is true you operate the criminal enterprise
Known as Roc-a-Fella in charge of his meteoric rise?
And do you deny you're responsible for the demise
Of record execs, and do you object?
Your distribution's Polygram, and through your connects
Def Jam, you pushed over five million SoundScan
And not to mention, your co-horts and henchmen
Dame, Biggs, Lyor, Kev' and Russell Simmons
And we ain't gon' talk about Murder, Inc.
That just establishes a darker deeper criminal link

The State is seeking the maximum penalty
And with the overwhelming amount of evidence
The D.A.'s presented, things aren't looking good

They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man

Despite the grim outlook at this point
The rapper has been known to emerge triumphant
In the face of adversity

They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man

Jay-Z is taking the stand

Right hand on the Bible, left hand in the air
Before I spoke one word, made sure my throat was clear
A-hem, I'm a prisoner of circumstance
Frail nigga, I couldn't much work with my hands
But my mind was strong, I grew where you hold your blacks up
Trap us, expect us not to pick gats up
Where you drop your cracks off by the Mack trucks
Destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors
Keep us spiralin, goin backwards
At age nine, saw my first hate crime
Blindfolded, expected to walk a straight line
Mind molded, taught to love you and hate mine
Climbed over it, at a early age, Jay shined
Fuck the system at Lady Justice I blaze nine
Your Honor, I no longer kill my people, I raise mine
The soul of Mumia in this modern day time

While the jury is inside deliberating
Outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation

They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man

Well the verdict has just been announced: Not guilty!
It is complete pandemonium out here! 
People are cheering and hugging - there he is
Jay-Z is exiting the courtroom right now
There is a swarm of cameras surrounding him 
And people are just rushing up to him
Let's try and make our way over there, Jay-Z! Jay-Z!",Dope Man,1999
Jay-Z,"Yeah, I know you just ripped the packaging off your CD
If you like me you readin the credits right now
If you in your car, I don't care if it's winter
I want you to put all your windows down
Zone out, buckle up, let's go

Hello it's Hova; that's right young'un the wait is over
The new millennium is upon us, the album is here
Before we get into the shit, let's get a few things clear
Rappers with no relation:
There's ""Seven Degrees of Separation"" and I'm Kevin Bacon
This is the murderer's version
Jigga the shit, even when he rhyme in third person
Hova the God, I should be rappin with turban
Haters can't disturb him, waiters can't serve him
Mike Jordan of rap - outside J workin
Now watch how quickly I drop fifty
I don't like playin, niggaz can't stick me
Niggaz can not jam me, niggaz can't get me
Slimmy at the Rucka wanna leave and spend with me
I consistently take 'em out the park like Ken Griffey
Do you believe?  It's Hova the God

[Pain In Da Ass]
Makes you think about the people in your life
Then I think about BIG; what'd he say if he was here
He'd say, ""Jay, what's it about?  What's life about?
If you don't go through as a man's a man""
He'd say, ""Suck it up, take the fall, do the time 
That's what makes you who you are, makes you what you are""
How many years you been around this thing of ours?

You don't betray who you are, what you are
You gotta remember guys like Taj, Chill, Ran, Emory
They don't roar, they don't rap
You know why?  That's the rules, you don't break them
You was born to be somethin' I wasn't even supposed to be, humble
Okay so you humble me now, what you got?
You got a war, you got global war 
You got a worldwide crime syndicate now
There's no rules, there's no parameters, there's no feelings
There's no feelings for this game
So.. five ten years from now
You're gonna wish there was American Commission
Five ten years from now
They're gonna miss Jay-Z
Oahhhkayyyyy, I'm reloaded!!!!!",Hova Song (Intro),1999
Jay-Z,"Who ever thought young Shawn Carter would change the game?
Used to rap to the raindrops off my window pane
Duckin the plain cops, pushin indo and 'caine
At the kitchen table late night, no pen, just my brain
First album niggaz love me cause they thought I was poor
Guess I'm successful, industry don't love me no more
Well I'm the same nigga from your corner, bubblin raw
Skully tilted, pants saggin, damn near touchin the floor
And I come with do-rags to your so-called awards
T-shirt with my chain out like fuck y'all all
Retrospect ain't been the same since I lost my dad
He's still alive, but still fuck you, don't cross my path
A&R's had me feelin like moss in the drab
So I turned the league out with ""Reasonable Doubt""
Get your CD's out, let's go, song for song
I'm the illest nigga doin it til y'all prove me wrong

Since I was waist height, late night, bustin in the clouds
Runnin wild, comin home late, cussin out my mouth
Niggaz said, ""Bryan leave your cousin in the house""
Everytime we play the Dozen, he's buggin out
While y'all was playin yo-yo, I was sittin on low pros
Dippin the po-po, gettin that dough-dough
No, no I ain't stupid I take loot kid
What's in the bank?  Shoot it
Lose it like I ain't do it

Hot holes and what-have-you, tryin to clock dough
Foes tryin to pop shots through you by code
Pigs tryin to grab you and lock up your soul
Through the Hot Apple, nighttime shots crackle

Not only cokeheads but the Feds in the Mercuray Topaz
After you, up the avenue
Tryin to give you big numbers, you got math to do
Tryin to make you miss summer, shit, that ain't cool

Up against the wall, tryin to pass through

Between my dog and the figures, the four gonna get'cha
Between life and death, they killed my spirit
So what little life I got left, y'all can expect me to ball

I hustle from, night to morning, dawn to dusk
Kidnap and robberies like, (c'mon nigga) ""You goin with us"" 
I held round table meetings so we could go on and discuss
Not only money but all the emotions goin through us
Why we don't cry when niggaz die, that's how the street raised him
Look in the air, say a prayer (hail Mary) hopin God forgave him
Cop liquor, twist it, tap it twice, pour it to the pavement
We live dangerous, often findin ourself in the eyes of strangers
(Who the fuck is you?)  My dream is big and in it my team is rich
As seen through the eyes of a nigga who ain't seen shit
Back to live action, I'm packin, I'm still in the mix

Coke cheap, my face is like a coupon
I gotta do Shawn, cause even when Jay-Z was lukewarm
I was gettin my loot on, nigga I'm too strong
Eat til the food's gone, they placed me on this earth
The twin brother of Rich Porter, separated at birth
I got the soul of a hustler, quiet noise like a muffler
Fuck with us, walk through the ghetto, see the place that corrupted us
Learn why we buck at the guys that come up with us
Ain't enough bucks for us to split in this shit

It's deeper of course
Follow the life of this reckless minor
At sixteen in the six hundred, unlicensed driver
Playin, cops and robbers, like shots can't stop us
Flippin a bird to the choppers (fuck you coppers)
Buck-thirty on the turns
Reckless abandon, when I'm standin on this pedal
Hand on my metal, minus all this time they tryin to give me
Lord help me, all I ever wanted to be was wealthy or
Somebody to tell me that they felt me
I tried to play the hand you dealt me
But you gave me five funnies an' shit
I was hungry I need menage money

Low and behold, it's the new and improved Jay-Z
Let me explain this to you baby
I spent nights out, days in
Niggaz was blazing, twelve noon where I was raised in
I felt caged in but kept roaming
Prayed for the Day of Atonement
Married to the streets no date of annulment
It seems every time it comes up
They postpone it
So I kept my chrome at the waist
Waiting for the omen
Savoring the moment and now you know

That's why no other rapper got a sound like that
Trap, trap of my life
Flashback, kill niggaz
Rap skills unmatched, Jigga man baby
I can't entertain it sometimes I can't explain it
God given, gifts of a soul for hard living
Far be it from me to question Allah's wisdom
Could've been lost in the system
Instead I'm involved with the rhythm
I dodged prison, came out unscathed from car collisions
I know I must be part of some mission
Shit I used take it for granted
Why they placed me on this planet
I would ask myself while writin raps to myself
But right there under my nose

When your ho put my stuff in the dash
Bust in her ass
To climax I come up with a nab

I knew that bitch want your cousin on your father's side
I mean damn, you don't even let me answer your cell
I mean damn, why I still got to ring the bell?

Jay-Z,"My life
Is in the arms of the man upstairs
Through trials and tribulations
He'll always be there
You see I know he loves me
And I know he cares
And he'll bever put more on me
Than I can bear

[Verse 1]
Is it a blessing to live or a blessing to die?
Let me finish out this hell with no questions why
I should be happy I'm on and dressing fly
But is the game changing me for the extra pie
If you could look into the life I live
Three sixty catching up to all the trife I did
Got my people up north trying to slice the bid
While I'm in love with a nigga with a wife and kid
Maybe if my pops ain't abandon me
I wouldn't let so many niggas take advantage of me
Using me some even put their hands on me
I wonder what the most high got planned for me
My life line getting shorter when I look in my palms
Swore I'll be nothing like my biological mom
She ain't raise me so naturally I never felt a bond
At 16 got my GED never saw a prom

[Chorus]
I been weak and I been strong
I been through the fire, I been through the storm
Try to do right and I know I do wrong
Just be happy for me when my life is gone
Cause no more hurt and no more tears
There'll be no more pain and no more fears
No more people in my face that's not sincere
So smile 4 me when I'm no longer here

[Verse 2]
At a young age I let the world turn me out
Pellets and purple haze been burnt me out
A hard knock life is all I learned about
Trying to eat the only thing I be concerned about
Telling my youth everything happens for a reason
Let him know ain't that his father wanted to leave him
If it wasn't for the streets he'd still be breathing
Trying to raise him myself but I know he need him
Me and my seed used to live off mostly welfare
Only two checks a month for us both to share
I remember making sure that the coast was clear
So I could boost us some muthafucking clothes to wear
Had to hustle 'cause them food stamps just wasn't enough
Upstate back to Broadway gott to go re-up
All this fast cash only turned the heat up
Can't afford to get knocked but who gonna feed us

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Can't shake these thoughts of suicide
Anyone I ever loved or was close to died
Ones I trusted or thought was being true lied
A lifetime of tears but only a few I cried
Try to take my past stick it up on a shelf
But my actions stem from all the pain I felt
I'm just trying to make the best out the hand I dealt
If I fall who can I turn to for help
Hope my man with me or with my health
Will he be there through good and bad sickness and health?
Does he want the real me or somebody else?
I been in wars just so I don't jurt myself
Now that I'm on most can't stand me now
They was happy when I rocked all them hand me downs
When I need them funny how they can't be found 
That's why the most high's my only family now

Chorus",Smile 4 Me,2000
Jay-Z,"Uhh, that's some shit
That that that niggaz ain't even seen before
That's that shit! (motherfuckers ain't never seen 
Nothing like this before, for real man)
It's goin down baby, uhh
Uhh! busta rhymes
What?! Uhh, dmx nigga
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh

I see ghosts clearly; even though, most don't hear me
They still want to get near me - fear me, so I'm leary
Kinda eerie what I'm feelin' - from the floor, to the ceilin'
Straight through the roof, want the truth?
I kinda miss robbin' and stealin'
Cause it kept a nigga hungry, only eatin' when I starved
I was ugly, so I robbed, no one loved me, shit was hard
Went to god once in a while when it got a little too hectic
He was the only one I knew that I respected (why?)
Didn't know why, didn't know what I was livin' was a lie
If I ain't shit then, why should I try
See, plenty niggaz die, over dumb shit, up in the hood
Real good heart, but up to no good
Thought I did what I could, but I guess it, wasn't enough
The devil told me it would happen but I kept callin his bluff
When it rains it pours now, my pains are yours
As yours are what's mine, define, revolvin' doors (nigga!)

[Chorus]
(why?) all my niggaz tell me (why) tell me (we die)
Cause we crazy with it, quick to blaze you with it
From in my soul to every word that I curse
With all the agony expressed in this verse;
Let me ask my niggaz (why?)
My niggaz tell me (why) tell me (we die)
Because we gods nigga (and) we go the yard nigga
Because I walk the ground under my feet
And keep it live and stay in tune with the street
Now let me ask my niggaz (why?)

They say the good die young, in the hood where I'm from
I only got one question to that - why the fuck am I here?
I look to the air, I ask god, ""love me please,""
But in reality, only people that hug me is thieves
Same niggaz that send shots through my rugby sleeves
They want to, slug me and leave, I'm thinkin' it must be me
Please shed light, the hood's dark
I did my dirt but got a good heart
Shouldn't that count for somethin?
I was told I'd amount to nothin, most of my childhood
Liked by folks it was stuntin' my growth
Separated me from the shit I was wantin' the most
Felt myself comin' close to pumpin' them o's
Lump in my throat, chest poked out, face was poker
Tryin' to, erase my ghostes, chase the smokers
Got demons on both shoulders, 
Tryin' to chauffeur my life through the streets
In other words nigga my will was weak
Please feel what I speak, 
This ain't your average ordinary jargon
Weak rap niggaz be talkin'
This shit is deep, from the mind of Busta, 'X and me
To all my fallen soldiers, rest in peace, til we meet niggaz

[Chorus]

I must be cuckoo, like I respect the new-you, never
See you too could get it through your Fubu sweater
Like a nigga when he walk in the dark, trespassin'
On a nigga land, shots echo loud in the park
I live and die for all the shit I believe
And rep for everything I stand for 
With every single breath I breathe
Like the intake from cigarette smoke, it's like you inhale
The demon in the gutter stressed struggled and broke
If the shit was all over tomorrow, I'd leave a treasure
For my kids with a legacy for my children to follow
You know it's funny how the good die first
Get the peppin' in your steppin' faggot nigga
Cause you could die worse
Hold on, you know I cut off my arm, in the name of reppin
Real niggaz in the midst of droppin' this bomb
Allah blessin' me to rep for the better, and carry on
Somethin' great and keep a nigga name livin' forever!

And even worse if I was broke would you want me?
If I couldn't get you finer things
Like all of them diamond rings bitches kill for
Would you still roll?
If we couldn't see the sun risin off the shore of thailand
Would you ride then, if I wasn't drivin?
If I wasn't ah, eight figure nigga by the name of jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me?
If I couldn't flow futuristic would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a nigga workin harder than nine to five
Contend with six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a balla?  so you can shop and tear the mall up?
Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo

Ambition makes me, so horny
Not the fussing and the fronting
If you got nuttin, baby boy, you betta

Late nights, candlelight, then I tear the cock up
Get it up I put it down erytime it pop up, huh

Feel the juice, then I got ya, when you produce a rocka

You look in my eyes and tell me they style ain't ridiculous

Sure if your favorite is long (get it get it) baby baby 
Don't you want to leave tonight and fuck wit me 
'cause we really need to be freakin' off at any cost 
Its on me, if you married, then get a divorce 
When I hits it, some women get twisted 
Have 'em twitchin', like ""damn look what the dick did"" 
I just want to hit it the worst way, right after a long day 
And put the puss on lay-a-way, heard me? 
I'm that, dirty nigga that get you hot, and heat it 
Baby girl if you wanted ass, why don't you eat it?

If niggas want war, bust slugs 
Nigga, what? I'm hotta hotta and just can't be touched 
Plus anybody that fucks wit me, gonna get felt 
How many want it? determines how the slugs get dealt 
'cause I split em split em
Choke then niggas like roaches and then (clip em clip em) 
Long as I'm alive I'ma (hit em hit em) 
Respect mines to the day of my demise 
Don't fuck wit me 'cause the flows (killa killa) 
Whoever ever who wants it? 
Its yours, now your gonna (get it get it) 
(feela feela) nigga full of holes 
Threat em like hoes and show no love to them homo thugs 
Its us you want to fuck with 
As soon as them slugs skip from body to body 
Go from brave to bitch
I don't respect it plus niggas committed treason 
Who want it with Ja? who ready to die breathing

Ja baby, one of the many many niggas who sip hennessy 
Wit the two seaters, sit'n on twenties

Then, thou bestow hit em up, gun em down 
Niggas ain't ready for Ja, anyways anyhow 
I give it give it go niggas, claimin' that they live it 
Real (niggas niggas) brandish then iron and flash 
Like (hold this hold this) when you got nothin' to live for 
Notice, niggas be hot, and more explosive 
Focus, ready to rip em up wit the dope, this 
My life, niggas is frontin' and stuntin' for nothin' 
Better act right, fore I spark and dim your light?

To bitches, when in doubt, go for stealth, and clap the finish 
Anything movin rightfully hit for wrong doing

Ay yo I got a resolution
This year I'm playing right
No six fifteen this year
You can stay the night
We can go bowling it ain't like before
Can't y'all see that I'm growing?
I was so immature
I was young and having money
Having honeys come to the crib
Thinkin' they shit and they couldn't get cab money from me
Some bad chicks didn't get pass the bridge
I went to One Trump Plaza on their asses'
No room service just snacks and shit
Work with those Lil' Debbies and when your done get ready
The chicks I was fiendin' to smash
Let 'em lean on the cash
Will take 'em on long trips
Break 'em with long dick
There was no such thing as strong relationships
But I'm off that playa shit
I need a chick that practice top cheese
That still can by weed
And can give me some good head
And I'll make her remind me, uh-huh

It's a hood thing, wood grain, off the chain
She give me good brain
Love the way I push my slang
Callin' my jack soon as the hop in my V
They catching contact, weed smoke all up in the weave
Bet'cha man can't do it like this, like this

Had niggas mad for real like ""I wish he was gay""
Cause they knew sooner or later hun was gettin' with Jay

Spittin' up in the Pacifics smoking spliffs in the shade

You used to smother her, look at your honey slippin' away
Consorting with hustlers, niggas that be giving her space

Jay-Z,"Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
Say, ""Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
But I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
Cause most niggaz don't know a brick from a bike
They keep buyin hard white
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
FYI, I never been robbed in my life""
Or, you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
Let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
Then, before they look up you sellin the town cook-up
Or, gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them
Still there Brooklyn?

Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'ma roll with that one

Make out a check for eight hundred dollars
Jigga Man, holla 

1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy
Whassup Sig?  This Chris out the Young Guns dog
Whattup?
I'm ready to smash these niggaz in the rap game
The niggaz takin too long with that advance money and shit
Yeah
Talkin 'bout chill, chill don't pay the bills
Yeah I feel that
I know you well connected dog
Let me holla at somebody real
Aight look, I got the perfect person for you, hold on
Bleek, line two

Listen shorty, you wanna roll just give me the word
I ain't got time for a sentence all that shit is absurd
You find a strip first, if you don't cook find a bitch first
If you don't hustle find a nigga who pitch first
You new in town, no red and blue in town, there's gangs
Don't get fresh, let 'em know you small change
The strong move quiet, the weak start riots
We know you got a brick but sell 'em twenties til they tired
With no credit, you know you sick with that gotta eat fetish
And other niggaz who gettin it, dead it
Make 'em an offer that they can't refuse
He resists, box him in, til he can't be moved
Here's the rules: chop it, bag it, stash it, stack it
Get in, get out, that's a O.G.'s classic
900-Hustler, you pass it around
Wanna speak to me direct, hit extension trey-pound, I'm out

1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your dog
What seem to be the problem young boy?
Yo whattup, this Murder Def Kill Homicide Nigga
I got two freaks
Yo watch your fuckin mouth man
Fuck you mean watch my mouth nigga?
Been on hold for about two hours nigga
I don't give a fuck how long you been on the line
Shut the fuck up!  Matter of fact, hold on
I know this nigga ain't just put, put me on hold man
This bullshit-ass elevator music
Free, pick up line five

First things first, watch what you say out your mouth
When you talkin on the phone to hus-tlers
Never play the house, think drought, keep heat in the couch
When you sittin in the presence of cus-tomers
Never hold out, pull out, throw heat and be out
If a nigga ever think that he touchin-ya
Lay low, get cake, whip all over the state
Stash dough, whip yay with, right amount of bake (hoe!)
Nigga too close went right around his place (yo!)
You stoppin dough when we clutchin the gats?
I know you heard ""Friend or Foe,"" this ain't different from that
Make sure you got your four-four and he can slip if he like
Young, Jon Benet daughter missin tonight and yo
Until you up stay away from them dykes and whores
Three smuts, two straights and a dyke
Can pause one-three rumbles two streaks and a pipe for sure
And if it's tight, then he might come back for more
Nine and four, everyday back and forth
Winter to summer, 1-900-Hustler
Pass the number til you're stackin balls
Tell you how to weigh shit wet and package more
I take cash or write the check out to F-R
Two E's, that'll be two G's
And forget my money I'm comin for all your ki's, nigga

But what we need to do, is put that mouth on a betta bitch
You heart the rhetoric, Jigga hit me over the head
With a champagne bottle at the bar, can he buy me a car?
Naw, how do y'all equate your pain
Would it all go away if I bought you a Range?
I got one or two of those, nothin' gon' change

Over my right shoulder I told you to wipe your eyes
Take your time when you likin a guy

If I shoot you, I'm brainless
Different toilet, same shit, and I'm sick of explainin this
I'm waitin on arraignment, my nigga is the plantiff
Yeah, I know what you thinkin, fucked up ain't it?
I shoulda known better, and I planned to
But dog they be takin me out of my zone like a nigga with a handle
I sat back and watched it, put the gats back in the closet
I tried to tie my hands like an Iraqi hostage
Let niggaz take shots at me, no response
I just, flip and, pop my collar like the fonz
You give a nigga a foot he'll take you one step beyond
He'll try to play you twice, the third time is the charm
You wanna conversate with the writer of the qu'ran
Or old testament, don't test him then
I know what y'all thinkin dick, pause
Your future's my past, I've been here before
I know when you're schemin, I feel when you plottin

I need to know, cheah cheah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah

You see me with a bodyguard that means police is watchin
And I only use his waist to keep my glock in
But when shit goes down you know who's doin the poppin
And if you don't know, guess who's doin the droppin
S dot again, y'all got him in a bad mood
Bad move that's bad news
How many times have I got to prove?
How many loved ones have you got to lose
Before you realize that it's probably true?
Whatever jigga say, jigga probably do
Shit I paid my dues, I made the news
I came in the door for dolo, blazed the crews
And the streets say jigga can't go back home
You know when I heard that?  when I was back home
I'm comfortable dog, Brooklyn to Rome
On any martin luther, don't part with your future
Don't ever question if I got the heart to shoot ya
The answer is simply too dark for the user
And as a snot-nose they said that he got flows
But will he be able to drop those before the cops close in?
'Fore the shots froze him, and he's dead and gone
From what the block has spoken, my god

Who he got pregnant, let me tell you, ah

I lost my pops when I was eleven mmm twelve years old
He's probably somewhere where the liquor is takin it's toll
But I ain't mad at you dad, holla at your lad
I grew up pushin snowflake to niggaz that was pro-base
The stress'll take a young nigga, give him a old face
All I did was smoke joke, think and drink
Copped 'caine and complained, front row watch game
I seen niggaz before me, with a chance to write they own script
Slip up and change the story
I seen young niggaz go out in a blaze of glory
Before reachin puberty, scared a nigga truthfully
I took trips with so much shit in the whip
That if the cops pulled us over the dog'd get sick, sniff
Smell me nigga?  The real me nigga, minus the rumors
Holla if you feel me nigga

The streets is not only watching but they talking now?
Shit they got me circling the block before I'm parking now
Don't get it twisted, I ain't bitching, I'm just cautious now
Sub, under the parka, extra cartridge now
Hit his click sig' up you fell at it you're dense
I get word to the street like bell Atlantic express
I feel the vibes and I hear the rumors
But fuck it, I'm still alive and I'm still in ju'maa I know 'stafallah
Niggaz wanna press me, put my back to the wall
But pressure bust pipes I know, I spat it to y'all
To know me is to love me, you see me, can't be me, hate this
Fuck you I got guns like Neo in Matrix
Cross the family, think mac's sweet like Cairo
Or soft like play-doh get knocked off like Fredo, Corleone
They find you with a hole in your dome
I roll with niggaz that'll follow you and go to your home
Thought you ball, but nigga you fall to my defense
Catch you while you reachin, clip you then I cross you then I'm leavin
Apply full court pressure
Like four-four ? Get you out of here, pull pressure
To the trigger, bullets fly in three's
You forever rest under bullshit, dirt lies and leaves
I do bullshit, dirt, tell lies then leave
Look in my eyes, realize it's beans

And straight up, divide they team
Trade they man for some pies and a couple of things

Jay-Z,"See I was, born in sewage, born to make bomb music
Flow tight like I was born Jewish
Used the streets as a conduit, I kept arms 
38 longs inside my mom's buick
At any given moment shawn could lose it, be on the news
Iron cuffs, arms through it, or stuffed with embalmin fluid
Shit, I'm going through it, mom dukes too
Tears streamin down her pretty face, she got her palms to it
My life is gettin too wild
I need to bring some sort kinda calm to it
Bout to lose it voices screaming ""don't do it!""
It's like '93, '94, bout the year 
That big and mag dropped; and ""illmatic"" rocked 
Outta every rag drop, and the west had it locked
Everybody doing 'em, I'm still scratchin on the block
Like ""damn, I'ma be a failure""
Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug, paraphernalia
Cops courts, and their thoughts is to derail us
Three time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts
Tryin figure where your mail is, guesstimate the weight you sellin
So they can send shots straight to your melon wait!
It gets worse, baby momma water burst
Baby came out stillborn, still I gotta move on
Though my heart still torn, life gone from her womb
Don't worry, if it was meant to be, it'll be, soon

Second oldest born, from Michelle brown my mother
Hell bound, grew with two sisters and one brother
Pop wasn't around, so many stories that's another
I'm thinking damn, how my older sister gon' make me tougher
When steel sharpens steel, I'ma keep it real
I'm tired of trying to hide my pain behind the syrups and pills
Dead to the world, stretched out like a corpse for real
Y'all niggaz thinking what y'all reading in the source is real
What my life like, you looking at the source, it's real
What your life like?  mine dog, of course it's real
Passin judgment, you niggaz second-guessin beans
Cause you don't eat swine don't make you amin
Dog you know a couple suras, out the qur'an
I guess you all on your deen and I ain't on mine
Stop that akki, 'fore I send shots though your body
Make 'em feel feel hell on earth before allah drop thee
I feel the line's drawn here, nuttin more can stop me
Till them feds pick me up, or them boys pop me
There's only three things that make mac not act like beans
Amatullah tisha, po aldin, samir amin
My seeds dog, gotta teach 'em that before I leave dog
Shit I know that I'ma see 'em when I leave dog
I come back in the afterlife

Now as I walk into the studio, to do this with jig'
I got a phone call from one of my nigs
Said my homeboy reek, he just lost one of his kids
And when I heard that I just broke into tears
And see in the second hand you don't really know how this is
But when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib
So I called mine, and saddened my wife with the bad news
Now we both depressed, countin our blessings cause brad's two
Prayin for young souls to laugh at life through the stars
Lovin your kids just like you was ours
And I'm hurtin for you dog, but ain't nobody pain is like yours
I just know that heaven'll open these doors
And ain't no bright side to losin life but you can view it like this 
God's got open hands homey, he in the midst, of good company
Who loves all and hates not one
And one day you gon' be wit your son
I could've rapped about my hard times on this song
But heaven knows I woulda been wrong

It wouldn'ta been life, it wouldn'ta been us

'cause I looked just like you
Said I'd be nothing but a crook
Just like you
The niggaz in the hood was shook
Where the just like you
'Cause all they said was little whitey look
I'm just like you
But dog I can't see it at all, shit
We never kicked it at all
We never pitched or kicked at a ball
Dog, you never taught me shit
How to fight, ride a bike, fix a flat
None of that sorts of shit

Fuck you left me out to dry, stuck
Gotta  teach news to box
Gotta teach news to bop
And that aint the half of it man
I gotta teach news to block

Sit down let me tell you 'bout your fatherless sons
How they grew to be men and father they sons
Father they daughters
Nigga, you left a fatherless daughter
I never follow your orders
Nigga you make me sick
Pussy you could, ooh
How you gonna leave these memories in the back of my mind
I can see it clear as day you smackin my mom
I 'member that day you showed me that gat, that 9
Put it in my palm when I was young
And said that would be mine, you turned me out
The reason why I hit the block
Reason why I tried to hit them cops
Reason why I started hittin shots
Reason why I started gettin licked
And drinkin syrup and skippin court
Ginger bread man never think of gettin caught
Look at your hand man damn you fought
Nigga you left my mom
Left us with no good-bye's
You left us out to dry
You left us with no letters, notes, (nothing!) no replies
No digits numbers was unlisted
You left us with some of my loneliest night
Nigga some of my hungriest nights
Shit, one of the reasons for years (shit embarrasin)

Yeah you gave us life like, fruit from a plant
We aint eat right from them foods from them stamps

Wanted to talk just like him (word)
Often momma said I look too much
And I thought just like him (it could happen)
Wanted to drink Miller nips
And smoke Newports just like you
But you left me, now I'm goin to court just like you
I would say ""my daddy loves me and he'll never go away""
Bullshit, do you even remember December's my birthday?
Do you even remember the tender boy
You turned into a cold young man
With one goal and one plan
Get mommy out of some jam, she was always in one
Always short with the income
Always late with the rent
You said that you was comin through
I would stay in the hallway (waitin)
Always playin the bench (waitin)
And that day came and went
Fuck You! very much you showed me the worst kind of pain
But I'm stronger and trust me I will never hurt again
Will never ask mommy ""why daddy don't love me?
Why is we so poor?, why is life so ugly?
Mommy why is your eyes puffy?""
Please don't cry everything'll be alright
I know it's dark now, but we gon' see the light
It's us against the world

I don't need no applaud, to clap again 

Let alone, no award, from rap to win 
Talk drama, get yourself wrapped up in 
Severe head trauma, get beat with the nine lime-a 
Cut your hand off if you fuckin with my product 

That slayed shit, I'm on the grave shift 
We all know fucked up money don't pay rent 
You short with my ones, you short one thumb 
You can't, come up short where the fuck I'm from 

We got, dues to pay, new tools to spray 
Who's to say, Bleek won't make news today 
You know the ooze'll spray if you refuse to pay 
And I move the yae nigga day by day

The world's most infamous

Hoffa, Dash, it's the Dynasty niggas
Check it out
Uhh, walk with me, talk to me, yo

The theme song to The Sopranos
Plays in the key of life on my, mental piano
Got a strange way of seeing life like
I'm Stevie Wonder with, beads under the doo-rag
Intuition is there even when my vision's impaired, yeah
Knowing I can go, just switching a spare
On the highway of life, nigga it's sharp in my sight
Oh!  Keen senses ever since I was a, teen on the benches
Every time somebody like Enus was mentioned
I would turn green, me, being in the trenches
Him, living adventurous not worrying about expenditures
I'm braving temperatures below zero, no hero
No father figure, you gotta pardon a nigga
But I'm starving my niggas, and the weight loss in my figure
Is starting to darken my heart, bout to get to my liver
Watch it my niggas, I'm trying to be calm but I'm goin' get richer
Through any means, with that thing that Malcolm palmed in the picture
Never read the Qur'an or Islamic scriptures
Only psalms I read was on the arms of my niggas
Tattooed so I carry on like I'm non-religious
Clap whoever stand between Shawn and figures
Niggas, say it's the dawn but I'm superstitious
Shit is as dark as it's been, nothing is going as you predicted
I move with biscuits, stop the harder niggas acting too suspicious

Jay-Z,"C'mon, yeah, Face Mob, uh, huh, uh, huh, uh
His name is Jigga, yeah, what's happenin' baby?
Wsup, wsup witcha? Tryin' to get this loot
Yeah, know what I'm sayin'? No doubt

So what's it gon' be? Women, whiskey, weed
Dope, coke or all the guns you need, nigga
You could get them thangs for a lesser fee
Yeah, and with the right amount of pressure, them thangs look free

I'm on my way now, desperate need of a lick indeed
Believe I got a vick if it's a brick you need
My nigga for sheez
Right back at you, holla after you land we get it before you leave
Is you for sure? Them niggas out there still got cheese
'cause my niggas in the drop bounced back to slangin OZ's

Man them niggas rapin' the town without breakin 'em down
Them bastards makin' a killin', slangin' half of buldings
For real man, I'm on my last nine thousand
Ain't got no money, I'm fightin' cases with this ho money

And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the fuck out the house
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the fuck out the house
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the fuck out the house

I caught a northwest flight to NY, on the buddy pass
Sittin' at the exit row, by the do'
I got a hoopty from this doofy nigga around the way
I had the fo'fo' under the rug, weekend ago

Three hours, I landed in the city of dreams
With tall buildings, flooded with cabs and limousines
Where the fuck is Jay-Z
Goddamn traffic is gettin on my nerve
I see your face by the curb

Goddamn dog I been sittin' here thirty minutes
You know these motherfucking cab drivers
Like they own this motherfucker
Open the trunk

And then I'm thinkin', Jigga let's get this motherfucking cash nigga
Well if it's a money thing let's get this motherfucking money man
And then I said to Jigga, let's get this motherfucking cash nigga
I got a dope house scoped out

An escape route?
No doubt, let's hit the highway, load up, lock
Let's do this shit
Hold up, cops

Trippin', it's eight million stories in this naked motherfucker
Yeah, and ten million undercovers
We gon' get this raw, we gon' kick in the door
They got guns in the couch, they got shit in the floor

Niggas is gon' shit they drawers
They got a bitch at the door
Bullshit, heard that stupid shit before

And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the fuck out the house
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the fuck out the house
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the fuck out the house

I hit the buzzer, Mita, Manny
Let me up it's Joey motherfucker
Takin' the steps up with only one thing on our mind
Wipe this motherfucker clean, everybody gotta die

Up the steps, got closer
The voices got louder, you hear it?
Death's approaching we comin' for that powder
Then I knocked four times, I hit the hoe wit clear polish
Well, she couldn't see shit, now what's it gonna be bitch?

How you say my love in spanish? (Mi amor) 
(How you say my love in thug) Can I hit it raw? 
In the backseat of my jeep, or maybe on the floor 
(Easy papi) Nah mami, teach me more

I ain't got no time for that now, dame un beso
(Wanna keep a good girl like I told you before) 
(Easy papi) Yeah, teach me more 

[Jay-Z]
I like fast cars, I love faster chicks 
You don't need a small waist, I take ass and tits
Love chicks that deep throat, love being left alone 
on a Sunday afternoon with the remote 
Love having my cake plus eating it too 
Shit, I got cake what the fuck I'm 'posed to do 
Like chicks to dress, but I love a good shoe 
Sophisticated mama with love for the hood too 
Love sexing girls on that boricua shit 
Love black girls that's when the Levi's fit
Chicks that play hard to get on that Aaliyah shit 
If at first I don't succeed, then believe I split 
Can you blame me? Young buck, dirty-ass pops trained me 
Moms allowed it, daddy was about it (Bout it)
Game got inherited 
Mama said if you find love you better cherish it 
Teach me! 

[Chorus]

I like to slow dance, I like to romance 
I like to, stroll through the park holding hands 
Ask me how my day was, tell me ""Ma looking pretty"" 
On Sundays in the cut watching ""Sex and the City"" 
Having long talks and good loving in the morning
Walk them dogs when my body is calling
Flesh air force cuts a wound with a line 
No stress of course, cause I don't have the time
Like to wine and dine but please hold your liquor, 'cause 
I'm rolling with ya and I hate a silly nigga
Like 'em rough and rugged, love it when you tug it 
You bugging out of line on that thug shit is nothing
Dealt with cats before that I had to train 
Dealt with cats that's poor and a cat with fame 
One who played basketball and I had more game 
So por favor, papi stay in your lane

Send shots like toma! in any language
Leave niggas in a coma when I'm bangin' that Fifth
Get chicks lit off Coronas and bamboo spliffs
And get the camcorder to camcord their hand movements
And for what? ya'll actin' like ya'll better than Hov'
Ya'll niggas should open up for the Letterman show

Cause we don't drop hits, we drop bombs that smash
Till the wrists is lit up, the arm looks like glass
The necklace chipped up, the charm it flash
Could fuck up your eyes like the bombest hash
See the reason why chicks let me palm they ass
All I gotta do is let 'em call me Shawn de'Glass
Let me sit up in they whip till I launch it back
Snap they neck, then shoot 'em till they aren't sent back
The calmest cat, trust me when I palm this gat
Kill your mind, body and soul, push your conscience back

Throw in the bank, trucks the size of tanks now nigga
I don't rap for pleasure I rap for chedder
Guns clap for treasure straight like that forever

I keep the gun tucked nigga

I ain't gotta talk no more
One in the leg, bet he won't walk no more
Ladies love me, why?
'cause I give em back shots
Niggas want to throw slugs but I bust back shots
It ain't even about trying to diss these niggas
It's about these niggas ain't built for these niggas
The R.O. yeah we simply street
You niggas cotton candy you simply sweet
I let the fifth spit without the red dot

Get mind right, your money light
Don't make me come out there
Snatch your whore and get it done right there
Little niggas ain't ready for war
Better get ready for bed
Buck shot land at your head
Buck shots right at your head
Sit you niggas in a permanent chair
Give you niggas permanent stares
Shut down the party with the cut down shotti
Make doctor, cut down your body
Keep a hammer fuck a strong arm robbery

One to hold me down, one I can count on
I'll even teacher how to load the glocks
Sophisticated school girl
Be on my block
Rocking braclets, anklets the basics
Petite nice body, skin and face sick
One I could shop with
Go uptown and cop with
She not a thug girl but my down chick
She know how to roll the weed but don?t smoke
She know how to cook the coke and bag dope
Screen my calls
Flip on me when im wrong
Talk shit thru the night
Throw it on me on the morning
She like it from the back
With my fingers in her hair
I love it in any position
Ma I don?t care
She like when I shine up them jewels that blind her
And drive by the projects while a nigger hollar

Bitches wanna hollar now
She back out the step
When yo niggers crowd around
That's my road dog
And you know I unload for her
She hold me down anytime I call for her
Like at the time when I crashed the Jag
She brought the Yukon 2000 black
Through a screen and a DVD
Twenites on the truck that'll piss you off
In return I sent her on a tour thru Sacks
With tengrand shoping spree to get back
I brought her a five that look nice when she drive
Put a glock on the dash
Watch the stash nigga

How you make it to the gates and forget the key?
I'm the one God chose so you blessed through me
Gotti Floyd getchu higher than that ecstasy

Hey yo I come through stunnin',

We rock rocks that'll light ya shoulders
Gotta lotta hot cars but the drops is colder (ah)
You see V-I-P me, Kelly, Gotti, and Hov'

All we do is spend cheese cause we love the dough
Mami roll more trees before it's time to go

If you got cash money then you feel this shit
And if you rollin' on them things then you feel this shit
If you drunk off in the club then you feel this shit
If you'se a motherfuckin' thug then you feel this shit
If you smokin' on some 'dro then you feel this shit
And if you off that ecstasy you got's to feel this shit
If you sippin' on some Cris' you got's to feel this shit
And if you throwin' up and shit, you got's to feel this shit

Fuckin with Mag, nigga end up in a hospital
Sittin on the corner of the bed, sick cause of what I said to him
On a track star beef take it in the kitchen
Cookin MC's all niggaz taste like chicken
Hittin 'em high, right in the ear
Slicin on 'em muh'fucker vampire style, I'm a bloodsucker
You turnin into a mad ducker, tellin ya dog
I'm at the Rucker with a bad Puerto Rican chick
Fat as my cash and she a dick sucker, get up outcha car
You ain't goin real far, see the chainsaw?
Breakin the law, like turnin a dyke
when it come to that man that just like Mike
I don't care what you like, I'll make you run in outer space
If you go to court man, only wish you got a case
For real, I'm fuckin faced on a hill of ice

Timbaland good for that - {*beat plays, he scats*}
{*scatting*} - I invented that
Hear the hi-hat, hear the bassline on the track
Remember ""One in a Million"" when I left ya back
Producers sayin, ""How you get your sound like that?""
I don't know playa, I'm a creative cat
Got party people dancin to dis and dat
Got party people sayin, ""This a dope-ass track!""

Timbaland hit 'em with the um, ah-um, ah-um-ahh, you gon' do what?
Stop frontin you bumpin the new cut
like a shoe ah, um ah-um ah, hit 'em in the gut
Twitchin and itchin to get up, I hit 'em up
With some skanless to vibe to and ride to
with the stanky inside you - listen to while a freak lickin you
Go on a bogus mission to, somethin you crip-walk in the kitchen to
Somethin you bump on the porch or the park
Or pump it while you displayin yo' heart when you flex on a mark
You can play it to clear your head from drama with the feds
and all the homies like down for when they in the dark
Used to rock up at the block club, players wasn't ridin slick
You can let your mind cruise for miles
They can't tell no sucker who's allowed, with a strap on the mic
I'm thinkin how can I move the crowd, move the crowd

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

I was workin at Burger King
Now take a good look around me
Look at all these cars, look at all these girls
Why you always tryin to put down me?
Why you always tryin to put down me?
You get 'round your friends and try to clown me

Bullets'll chase you like Moet mimosas
Catch us both coasts, racin' twin Porsche's
Boxes with glocks that'll pop ya to make ya ghost-es
Whoever come closest you've been warned

Make your way backstage, baby girl it's on

In the back of the club with ma-ma
Poppin' bottles of Cris with ma-ma
Put the bar on the tab for ma-ma

God damn she's fine but she parties all the time
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat back love
So I had to introduce her to the Mile High Club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project and model
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tahoe

Yung'uns ice-grilling me, oh, you not feeling me?
Fine, it cost you nothing, pay me no mind
Look, I'm on my grind cousin, ain't got time for fronting
Sensitive thugs, y'all all need hugs

Get a couple of chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll menage before I reach my garage
I don't want much, fuck I drove every car
Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers
Bird-ass niggas I don't mean to ruffle y'all
I know you waiting in the wing but I'm doing my thing

And then the Fugees gon' break up, now everyday I wake up
Somebody got something to say
What's all the fucking fussing for? Because I'm grubbing more
and I pack heat like I'm the oven door?
Niggas pray and pray on my downfall
But every time I hit the ground I bounce up like round ball
Now I don't want to have to kill sound
Don't want to have to cock back the four pound bar
Look scrapper I got nephews to look after
I'm not looking at you dudes, I'm looking past ya
I thought I told you characters I'm not a rapper
Can I live? I told you in ninety-six
that I came to take this shit and I did, handle my biz
I scramble like Randall with his
Cunningham but the only thing running is numbers fam

Then I wake up to more bullshit
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
Now that I'm successful you'll pull this shit
Nigga I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
Let's end the speculation, I'm talking to Alla y'all
Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait
Whatchu mad cause you push dimes and he sell weight?

Cracks in my palm, watchin' the long arm of the law

Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
That same dude you gave nothing, I made something doing
What I do through and through and
I give you the news, with a twist it's just his ghetto point-of-view
The renegade, you been afraid
I penetrate pop culture, bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they
Pop toasters, and they live with they moms
Got dropped roasters, from botched robberies niggas crotched over
Mommy's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
No he's not around, now how that sound to ya, jot it down
I bring it through the ghetto without riding 'round
Hiding down ducking strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothing relate to it?
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt

Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
'Cause see they call me a menace, and if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Using his music to steer it, sharing his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're saying you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfucking drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Now now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fucking do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage!
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo

What's on my mind at, any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade! Never been afraid to holler
About anything (anything?) anything (anything!)

I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat
Feelin' braver, durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan my pops left me
And often my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home
To quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor, thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics
Raisin' my head to the sky, Big, I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
As a monger of hate and Satan a scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today
See it's easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie
While I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they try to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? (huh?) I'm just a kid from the gutter
Making this butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause I'm a motherfucking

So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

Good dudes, I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga got move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We shoulda been together havin 4 Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
Well somewhere in a small town, somewhere lockin a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick

I can't see 'em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry
I can't see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

On repeat, the CD of Big's ""Me and My Bitch""
Watchin Bonnie and Clyde, pretendin to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand sayin, ""Let me see that clip""
Shoppin sprees, pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed, and we got flipped
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see - that's it
It was the cheese helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy
And then they got fussy and they don't remember that
And I don't remember you

I can't see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Yeah I seen 'em comin down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without gettin at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga livin was whack
But you don't get a nigga back like that!
Shit I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had, just like that
I was just fuckin them girls, I was gon' get right back
They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's goin bad, she's gone forever
And more forever
Shit I gotta live with the fact I did you wrong forever

I can't see 'em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry
I know I seen 'em comin down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry

I'm from the streets where the
Hood could swallow a man, bullets'll follow a man
There's so much coke that you could run the slalom
And cops comb the shit top to bottom
They say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet home
Where personalities crash and chrome meets chrome
The coke prices up and down like it's Wall Street homes
But this is worse than the Dow Jones your brains are now blown
All over that brown Brougham, one slip you are now gone
Welcome to hell where you are welcome to sell
But when them shells come you better return 'em
All scars we earn 'em, all cars we learn 'em like the back of our hand
We watch for cops hopping out the back of van
Wear a G on my chest, I don't need Dapper Dan
This ain't a sewn outfit homes, homes is about it
Was clapping them flamers before I became famous
For playing me y'all shall forever remain nameless
I am Hov'

Sure I do, I tell you the difference between me and them
They trying to get they ones, I'm tryin' to get them M's
One million, two million, three million, four
In just five years, forty million more
You are now looking at the forty million boy
I'm rapping Def Jam 'til I'm the hundred million man
R., O., C.

I came into this motherfucker a hundred grand strong
Nine to be exact, from grinding G-packs
Put this shit in motion ain't no rewinding me back
Could make 40 off a brick but one rhyme could beat that
And if somebody would of told 'em that Hov' would sell clothing
Heh, not in this lifetime, wasn't in my right mind
That's another difference that's between me and them
Heh, I'm smarten up, open the market up
One million, two million, three million, four
In eighteen months, eighty million more
Now add that number up with the one I said before
You are now looking at one smart black boy
Momma ain't raised no fool
Put me anywhere on God's green earth, I'll triple my worth
Motherfucker, I, will, not, lose

I sell ice in the winter, I sell fire in hell
I am a hustler baby, I'll sell water to a well
I was born to get cake, move on and switch states
Cop the Coupe with the roof gone and switch plates
Was born to dictate, never follow orders

Gil introduced me to the game that changed my life up
East Trenton grew me, had me skipping school
Valencia's boyfriend Vovo had me making moves
Momma raised me, pop I miss you
God help me forgive him I got some issues

He's gone 'til November, how can I not remember?
Tell your moms I'm there for her and Tiembra
And your son too, there's nothing I won't do
Unless you was me, how could you judge me?
I was brought up in pain, y'all can't touch me
Police pursued me, chased cuffed and subdued me
Talked to me rudely, cause I'm young rich and I'm black
And live in a movie, not living by rules

Ain't they know it, when it comes to love, I don't lie (we don't lie man)
And the girls respect me for it (you gotta respect that)
Ain't gonna say my nose can't be open (I may never say never)

Yo put your number on this paper cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

Who! Who you lovin', who you wanna be huggin', heh
Who you wit, who you wanna be fuckin'
Got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question
I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression
To put this in layman's term, I gave her some knowledge
She gave me, brains in return, she had to drop out of college
Knowin' she does this homework, I give her in house tutoring
In and out I'm movin' through her student body union and
She, call me professor, say daddy come and test her
So she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester
I'm like, at this rate ma, you never graduate
She said, I ain't no fool I make it up in summer school

I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore

Heh, who you lovin', who you wanna be fuckin'
Who said what, why you trippin' girl, why's you fussin'?
Got this model slash actress slash part time waitress
Spend a whole day she hangin' round with part time haters
All they do is dish dirt and put a up on my latest
Itinerary, but since I tend to vary see
I tend to carry, more rumors than ten Mariah Carey's
Tend to hurries in ten places at once
Plus she can't front just peep how I run mines
Ma, our time together is our time together, and uh
Our time apart is our time apart
So love Jay with your mind girl and not your heart
And some day I slow down, but for now I get around
Like the late Makiavelli or Perelli twenty inches
Or Caine and O-dog, stick up tape from menace
You tell 'em chicks if they must know my business

I'm tryin' girls out, just tryin' girls out
Put your number on this paper cause I would love to date ya

I'm tryin' girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

I'm lookin' for, southern girl that cook like Patti LaBelle
Big ghetto booty, scarf over doobie
Chanel under the Louie, Gucci over booty
Vicki covered titties, attitude of the city
Pretty, witty, girly, whirly
One who likes to party but come home early
Light kinda dark, short sorta tall
Slim, kinda thick I swear I love 'em all
She can cook the coke and got hook up on the license
But she can get you first class seats for coach prices
Isn't this great, my flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds

I'm tryin' girls out, just tryin' girls out
Put your number on this paper cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I get off tour
I'm tryin' girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper cause I would love to date ya

And I'm going all out
I circle the vultures in a van and
I run the block (run)
Pull up in a drop (pull up)
Push up on my money (push up)

Was hurtin 'em in the home of the terrapins; got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese i would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, i was birthin 'em

Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, d.a. want to box me in
But somehow, i beat them charges like rocky

Cracks in my palm, watchin the long arm of the law
So you know i seen it all before
I seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things i hate
Succeed in this rap game, the two things that's great
H to the izz-o, v to the izz-a
What else can i say about dude, i gets bu-sy

Jay-Z,"For the record y'all, uh-huh
I know you hear me, for the record y'all

Dynasty album, track 16, listeners fret
I can't take back that sixteen
Shit the truth spoke, I gotta give the world true quotes
Can you feel it? I know the truth hurts
They say, ""How can he disrespect his pop with harsh curses?""
Simple - harsh life, harsh verses
""I can't believe the mouth of this prick
He said put his mouth on his dick,""
I know we gotta talk bout that, I know you salt bout that
You on the tip like I don't like you
I got four kids, three baby mothers, I'm just like you
Sometimes I wanted to just fight you, shit
Swing on you - think I'm playin man, I'm just like you
I was a kid with a puzzle
With missing pieces tryin to put it together dawg, you put it together
You made me have to foot through the weather
In the storm with no raincoat
I don't only speak on me, I speak upon the kids in the same boat
Ridin the same water, same situation
Same fatherless daughter - I hate you, that's in your mind
Don't get caught up in the rhyme
You think I dissed you now, that I don't miss you now
Don't be a hater now, be glad I made it now
I know I probably rubbed you the wrong way
But fuck what the song say, for the record, check it

[Chorus]
Still got love for you, though you left me in the cold
To face this world alone, and make it on my own
I still got love for you, but I just can't fight the pain
It's so hard not to hate, but you grow up in a way

Listen - that was my hurt in my heart talkin, along with the truth
I would thirst often as a youth cause of you the person
Moms nursing self-esteem issues
Round the house it's hard to find a clean tissue, minus her tears
To rewind this time I promise I minused my years
To the day to take the pain away
Seemed sunny outside, always rained on Jay
Pop you my umbrella, come help your son with the weather
Soon we come together like man and man and build
Play space, cards face up, I've come to deal
In order to get right we gotta deal with this wrong
And the pain I felt all my life you feel in the song
Your lack of warmth left a chill in the morn'
Your lack of love, left me loveless, and I'm of your breath
I'm your mind body and soul, your heart, your flesh
Your alcohol, your smoke, in results I'm a mess
And dad, still I love you no less dad
Hope you didn't think success would make me less mad
But not mad, just disappointed - we wasted years
I swear to God, may you take me away from here
If you taught me anything
The one thing you taught me is to face my fears, coward
How could you let me grow without you?
Grind in this rap game, take dough without you?
Wear my Pro Keds close to the sole without you?
Family pictures pose without you - WHY?!
Why shouldn't I be mad?
Monster's parents separated, Monster had his dad
These parents had they problems, he still came to the pad
He bought 'em new bikes, imagine what that felt like
Used to have to butt my head to go to sleep at night
Nigga you did me wrong but the love is strong, let's move on

You want to fuck trick your bitches
I duck flip my bitches, get that cash with that extra ass bitch
Plus I keep a gat at arm reach 
You ain't no hustler youse a car thief, nigga where your car keys
Crack topic, back block it

Drove customers crazy in the late 80's, early 90's
Now you can find me, girlie behind me, holdin' my mink up
Ice pinkie ring in the air, drinkin' my drink up
Top down, 'dro in the air, blowin' that stink up
It's seldom that I smoke, but it helps my thinker
Makes me a mathematician about my math
Get celebrity ass, I'm a statistician, rap with precision
Nigga, your hoe chose Hov', that's rapid division
Now divide yourself and slide
I, young Vito, voice of the young people
Mouthpiece for hustlers, ventriloquist for jugglers
Took it where few went, made a few cents
Don't call me Hov' no more, call me The Blueprint
Sold dope and sold crack and sold soap and sold rap and
Bought Bentley's, bought 'em back, nigga can you buy that

Purpose of my gun, run in yo' shop and take pies
Purpose of my son, raise him to do the same

Benz Coupes, Jags and trucks when we roll out
Man it ain't no lie, it's real as this four-five
And real as these five salaats, whether we Deen or not
Our kids gotta eat, red Beamer stops
Where your connects gotta meet, interrupt your cop
Dependin' on the dope size, we slide it from size
With hammers with hollows you feel we follow we're both risin
They killed your cousin you strapped and you won't ride and don't think cause I rap that I won't
Play O-Dog in Menace and drive-by men
Real gangsters keep a bitch in the wheel, workin' the gas tank

You got your own '96 suh-in the ride
And keep your ass tighter than Versace that's why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me
They conniving shit
The first chance to crack the bank
They try me, all they get is 50 cent franks
And papayas, from the village to the tele
Time to kill it on your belly no question
I got more black chicks between my sheets than Essence

Meet your death in less than 8 seconds

And eek classes with mo in the glasses
Shows in Cali wit all the flavor suede Bally's
Now all your mens' up in your Benz's
High post, I swear you be killin' me
Playin' inside my pubic hairs
I never worry bout them other chicks
Cause you proved who was your wiz
When you was spinnin' that bitch
I took a little when you was up north

How you livin' large on the island
All them collects have me vexed

The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin
Now they ´bout nothin - if ever you mad about somethin
It won´t be that; oh no it won´t be that
I don´t be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no you won´t see that
And no, I ain´t perfect - nobody walkin this earth´s surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin´ at Hermes, Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don´t have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don´t let the necessary occur, yep!

[Jay] All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend.
[Bey] Down to ride ´til the very end, it´s me and my boyfriend.

(Talk to ´em B)
If I was your girlfriend
I´ll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if it´s somebody was me
Yeah-hee (break it down for ´em)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I´ll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I´ll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

[Chorus]

Jay Z, Freeway, 8 Miles,
Let's go

8 miles and running, got my 7 album droppin',
And my 8 album coming,
Feedin' a thousand growling stomachs,
But I could rewind the counter ta back, back,
When it was now or nothing,
People said I would amount to nothing,
That I had time for nothing,
Said I wasn't from the velars
Or the sellers by your gunman,
I can see the folks now he got what he had coming,
Now that my 8th album's coming,
Everybody smiling wanting something,
Claiming that they done something for em,
Got Jay Z and pom poms in they whole uniforms,
Claiming they be running and telling everybody like Martin Lawrence,
About how hot my rap performance was before I was who I was,
Claimin' that they threw it up before I threw it up, you what
Where was you before I blew this up,
I didn't see you in the courtroom when everyone was suein' us,
I didn't see you in all black when everybody was suitin' up,
Back on the block, kickin' it in and it was no you with us

8 miles and running, got my 7 album droppin',
And my 8 album coming,
Feedin' a thousand growling stomachs, freaks
6 miles and running got my fist straight poppin',
And my first album coming feedin' 20 promises I made

6 miles and running in the Pontiac,
6 thousand 86 trans mic shift,
While the engine run,
Anyone turn around
And give me one more chance,
Let em smoke and scream em one more grams,
So I'm a bring them, homie, son and my pop,
Stick close to my momma, keep toasters for drama,
Mix a lot with my son, my son growin' and he learnin' a lot,
That's what I'm toastin', that's what I'm burin', so pop,
Right on your own, rell 'em nigga, tell 'em nigga,
Its like a biblical scripture,
Look back turn to salt like the sinners
And most y'all heartless and self-centered
Like me shaggin', me shack,
Set up your brother cause you tell us nigga,
Heat back, uh, like, you never love for never
And cops watch every step, 6 miles and running
Dodge in every trap, the rap ginger bread man,
Cherish every precious breath, stat pick a second gat
Uh

8 miles and running, got my 7 album droppin',
And my 8 album coming,
Feedin' a thousand growling stomachs, freaks
6 miles and running got my fist straight poppin',
And my first album coming feedin' 20 promises I made

Back when nobody would find me a talent,
Nobody would sign me, nobody believed in me,
Nobody but mommy blindly, but how could she deny me,
Me being the youngest friend to come up out of her,
Tell me, she got every love for me,
When niggas would worn me the industry shun me,
That's why I'm taking all the industries money,
Revenge is sweet honey, we run this,
Young is the illest, free is the future,
Beans and bleekers right now,
We can see our 8 miles nigga

Feelin it if you feel it raise your L in the sky 

I keep it realer than most I know your feelin it 
Cristal on ice I like those toes I keep spillin it 
Bone crushers I keep real close I got the skill for this 
On my back the fliest clothes lookin ill and shit 
Transactions illegitimate cause life is still a bitch 

And then you die but for now life close your eyes and feel this dick 
Since diapers had nothin to live for like them lifers but 
Makin sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher 
We paid the price to circular success they turned my mic up 
I bout to hit these niggas that'll light they life up 
If every nigga in your clique is rich your clique is rugged 
Nobody before cause everyone would be each others crutches 
I hope you fools choose to listen I drop jewels bust it 
These are the rules I follow in my life you gotta love it

If why'all niggas ain't talkin 'bout large money what's the point?

I'm in the rain doing a buck 40 hydroplanin what shorty

I'm thorough in every boro my name be ringin 
Warmin it up for the perfect time to hit your brain and 
Ya Feelin it? to all the girls I bought the girdle to conceal my bricks 
No doubt they can vouch my life is real as shit 
95 south and poppy on the hill and shit 
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed wit shit 
And all the thorough ass niggas that I hustle wit 
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit 
These fake rappers can't really know I'm lovin it ya feelin it

What why y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay high? 
The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch 
I keep it tight for all the nights my mom prayed I'd stop 
Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot 
Those nightmares mom 
Those dreams you say you got give me the chills 
But these mils make me hot why y'all feel me 
Enough to stop the illin right? 
But at the same time these dimes keep me feelin tight 
I'm so confused 
OK I'm gettin weeded now I know I'm contradicting myself 
Look I don't need that now 
It just once in a blue moon when there's nothin to do and 
The tension's too thick for my sober mind to cut through 
I get disownin me and the chick goin to the island we're bonin 
I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moanin

Pure coke copper, get your order up

It's gonna cost you more if I gotta get em to Florida
Rucka game attender
With the bent pole on the sidewalk with the tin plates on the fender
I ain't hard to find you catch me frontin center
At the Knick game, big chain and all my splender
Next to spike and the pen left to write
I own Madison Square, catch me at the fight
But damn once again if you pan left at the ice
If you the man that write cheques with the hand that don't write
I go off the head when I'm rambling on the mic
And I go off the feds when I'm srambling at night
And if its off the set I brought hammers to the fight
But we from New York City, right Cam? [Cam: Ya damn right]

[Chorus, Juelz Santana]
It's the home of 9-11, the place of the lost towers
We still banging, we never lost power, tell em

Now that's danger there's nothing left to shape up
Welcome to New York City, welcome to New York City

Yo, there's a war going on outside no man is safe from

Wig split, melon cracked, all that on day one
Carry eight guns, two in the trunk
Two in the waist, two in the ankle, two to just spank you
You can jam with them jammers, blam with them blammers

You think we know what life do, make want to mold the cycle
Drinkers they so delightful, blinging with so much ice
In front of sparks, body cops Dilano
Block away watch by Gotti and Girvano
It's la costra nostra, someone close approach ya
They'll toast ya gopher, bread loaf with shofer
Old coke they raise up and snort, blayze up ya fort

Pimpin' this game quickly, and brody and niggas quit me
For cat that talk iffy, get swung on like K. Griffey
They spit willie, though half of the bitches feel me
The other half is trashed, 'cause words could never kill me
I got this thick, it's ridiculous how I switch shit
Look who I'm with, 215 and Timbaland, bitch
Whether it's friend or foe, Heiniken, Verde, Cris or Moe
I'm stackin' decimals, stoops, steps and best of yous

Niggas is homos really, but when they smokin' on purple
They get loco, but you know I know the drilly
It's for these positions, that's why I keep the biscuits
You ain't Tony Sopranno, you pussy, sleep with the fishes

Half of the shit I've been through

Arrows through your apparel, I will dearly depart ya
It's clearly hard for ya, what God has bestowed on me
You nah destroys me nigga; nigga I'm poetry
In four part harmony, it's like Jodeci
Check out my melody, my flow is a felony
Oh, I'm so seventies, I'm in tune with the heavenly
Governing body - check, check, check out my destiny
I walk leaving four footprints

Don't put your fucking clothes back on 'til you rich

The power of the P-U-S-S-Y
That's why every motherfucker in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the P-U-S-S-Y, let's have some fun
S-s-y, that's why niggas get they hair cuts, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, he cop the best ride
For the power of the P-U-S-S-Y

I know this girl we call her Sweet Cooch Brown
Hands down, mami had the bombest pussy in town
One dip in the girl pool, that's all it took
One sample of the snapple, and ya ass was whupped
Have you buyin' Gucci sandals, matchin' pocket books
Blowin' up her beeper ringin' her phone off the hook
Ball players they spit money, rappers they spit time
All a while they both clamin' that they never spent a dime
Business guys, she would victimize
Have 'em paying rent on condos in the Miami high rise
We ask her, who pussy is this look her right in her eyes
She said this pussy's yours daddy, tell 'em nothin' but lies
They didn't believe it, but they wanted to, needed to
She had the type of body, that you didn't want leavin' you
So they ignored all her flirtin' ways
And put a ring on her finger I'm like, Earth to Dave

[Chorus]

I ain't no rapper, but I'ma say my shit
When it comes down to that motherfuckin' clit, clit, clit
Niggas are sick, sick, sick, turn on you quick, quick, quick
That's why I be givin' mami much, dick, dick, dick
Why'all chumps be coppin' them furs, and all that
Feining for this pussy, as if y'all was on crack
When it comes to the truth, I can't hold back
Y'all cats that be babysittin', and these balls need to be smacked
It's this nigga named Monroe, that I know from way back
He hit the lotto bought his girl a Cadillac
Now this bitch be creepin' behind this niggas back
He busted her guess what, he still took the bitch back
3 things niggas love, money, pussy, and drugs
Can't get one without the other 'less you soft in love
Now take it from a player whose done all the above
Niggas it's the lesbian, R&B thug

The power of the P-U-S-S-Y
That's why every motherfucker in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, that gotta have the best ride

The power of the P-U-S-S-Y
That's why niggas get they hair cuts, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the P-U, I see you

The P is for the pearl tongue that I like to tickle.
The U is for uterus, down deep in the middle.
SS is so slippery when I go up inside.
Pussy's good and if you gettin some I know you know Y.
See I got my first shot when I was bout seven.
Her father called my house he said,
""I need to talk to yo son Devin.
My daughter she's eleven and she goes to the same school that yo son goes to.
And she said today she got screwed.""
But my daddy answer the phone so no drama, and all he said was,
""No shit! Let me talk to that girl mama!""
Then I was suspended three day, taken from school.
It was like a vacation.
Niggaz lookin' at pussy at the pool in our apartments.
I started hittin' hard when I was small.
Let me recite a story lesson for all of y'all.
See pussy's like a wound it would never heal,
The more ointment you put on then the better it feels.
Cuz it's

[Chorus]

Niggas would do anything
For some pussy, hey, hey, hey, oh

Girl I wanna freak your body-adi-adi (what you want it?)
I just wanna take you home with me

She get it from her momma
You can't tie a sweater over that ass, or hide it in pajamas
We lay back, blowin' ganja
DVD, she make it hard to watch a flat TV, whoa
I crept up behind her
Mami threw it like a quarterback, I caught that like Rice
I call mami Montana, bandana
Tied her hands up, this is gangsta love
Threw on a rap CD, we gangsta fucked
This ain't R&B smooth, I ain't a R&B dude
Poured a glass of Army, got mama in the mood
Then she stripped for me like the ""Moulin Rouge""
I think I might wife her
Y'know, powder blue Roc-a-Wear suit, white Nike her
Add mami to the cypher
R.O.C. for life cuz, the gang motherfucker

[Chorus]

I make ya hotter than the next bitch, no need
For you to ever sweat the next bitch, with speed
I make the next bitch see the exit, indeed
Gotta know you're ver-ily respected, by me
You get the keys to the Lexus, but no drive
You get your own 2002, she through ridin'
Keep yo' ass tighter than Versace
That's why you gotta watch yo' friends
You gotta watch me, they connivin' shit
See I just wanna freak your body-adi-adi
I know you don't do this for everybody-adi
But everybody ain't as horny as me
And your body's, callin', me

[Chorus]

Uhh, yeah
Mami shot through the pad with the Mark Jacobs bag
The thick stitched seam and her favorite ass jeans
Y'all know the first date wearers
To make objects bigger than they appear like a rear view mirror
Oh her shoe game is real
She gave 'em the Christian Libountins(?) with the four inch heels
But honestly my favorite type of gear
Is a scrungy for her hair and LaPearla underwear, clear?

Girl I hear you callin', let's stop stallin'
Do what we came to do

It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home)

It's like the ""War of the Roses"" goin on in my house
It's a little separation but I know how to fix the situation
Mami just sufferin from love deprevation
So I gotta give her thug reperations
Put it in the life until love leg is shakin
Slow and passionate, 'til we forget what happens
Then we laughin and we back friends

You don't have to fuss and fight
Why don't you just spend the night
Baby let's just kiss and hug

Girlfriend didn't believe me when I said I'd be back in a little
Cause I had the Chris T on with the crease in the middle
Plus a fresh cut and the freezin icicles
On my wrist, on my hand, that's when shit hit the fan
Said, ""You never spend timey, what's up with that?""

And forced me to fall asleep to her heartbeat

Sex so intense, all that's on my mind
It ain't feel this good since the very first time
I'm pullin her close, she's pullin away
I'm tryin to kiss her mouth but she keeps turnin her face
Cute sex game like our very first date

I would often find I was off my block
Couldn't keep her off my mind, my balls were shot

Was in my pores to push rock raw
Take a lost rebound like Bo Outlaw, I'm so outlaw
Got a hunger for this game, but keep that on the low
Like a one against the grain

Got the sun against my brain
A girl in my ear
I like her for her
I'm a dig into this shit, I like it like I like her

You never know who your true friends until you, ah umm
Both got a little bit of money
I mean, 'cause y'all both broke

Then there's no strain on the relationship, y'all both broke
And if you got money and he ain't got no paper
He still needs you so you'll never know how he really feel about you
When y'all both get some paper, you'll see

And you'll be wrong again if you bet against him

Sit right there, and watch me freak yo girl chocha
Tongue all down her throat as if a nigga was trying to choke her

I'm a alternative rap, I'm playin' the blues

Jay-Z,"Dear God, how can I explain myself?
Oh God, bless me indeed when I'm so confused
Enlarge my territory
Place Your love and protection over me at all times
Help me
Keep me away from evil, somebody answer me
Allow me not to cause pain

Police in the background, screamin', ""Put the thing down""
That's how hard I was trying to put my thing down
Sirens ringin' out, old ladies screamin' out
All this attention for me and I'm barely sixteen now

It's feelin' like a dream now
Handcuffed, roughed up, I'm tossed in the bing now
I'm lyin' next to fiends now, that's the end of the story
Let me bring y'all niggaz back to the very first scene now

December 4th, a child is born
Before I knew it, had my pops trousers on
That's how we do it when the man of the house is gone
You either stand or fall, I chose to stand

The hawk outside, so I blow my hand
It's a cold, cold world but I overstand
Tryin' to stay focused but I feel hopeless damn
Can't cope with bein' broke, I'm a man, c'mon

Son, don't let these streets, get the best of you
I will be right by your side, when you goin' through
Son, just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Get the best of you

Late one night I was rollin' the streets
Just thinkin' about what's goin' on with me
And trapped in this thug life, tryin' to break free
But this thug life just keeps callin' me

I'm livin' life way too dangerously
I'm drownin' in my misery
Looked in the mirror, there's my enemy
'Cause poppa never was a part of me

""Take one step at a time"", mama said
Sweet memories still remain in my head
All of my life been lied to, misled
Voices be like, ""Don't you wish you was dead?""

No ground to place my feet, I feel the fire under me
A way out is all I need, somebody, answer me

Son, don't let these streets, get the best of you
I will be right by your side, when you goin' through
Son, just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Get the best of you

Now the only thing left is more spirit to roam free
'Cause ain't no goin' home for me
It's a cold, cold world but I blew my hand
A true first 'cause I knew that man

I knew what he would do if I didn't draw first
And I couldn't stand the thought of
My momma steppin' foot inside a church
All I try to do is try to get up out the dirt

Guess, he's tryin' to do the same
Told me, get up out his turf
I wanted to talk to him but that shit'd never work

We was cut from the same cloth
And what was under his shirt was his momma's rent
His young brother's clothes, my nephew's food
And with that I suppose and with that I froze

Now my life is frozen in time behind these iron folds
And this story is told for young soldiers
Who never choose the life we chose

Son, don't let these streets, get the best of you
I will be right by your side, when you goin' through
Son, just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Get the best of you

Tears in my eyes as I look up
I'm tryin' to hold back my pride but reality is screamin'
Gotta get a job 'cause momma also screamin'
Streets are just like drugs and it's like I'm out here fiendin'

Forget all the hits in the industry
'Cause ain't no exceptions in this game for me
Look, neither God or my enemies
I choose God 'cause He understands

This young man with a thuggish heart
Whole world in his hands but still torn apart
Like I'm so close but it's still so far
Nightmares of me in a swervin' car, oh

No ground to place my feet
(My feet)
I feel the fire under me
(Hey)
A way out is all I need
(All I need)
Somebody answer me

Son, don't let these streets, get the best of you
I will be right by your side, when you goin' through
Son, just don't let it

Just don't let it

Jay-Z,"Look for me, Young, B
Cruisin' down the west-side, highway
Doing what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl wit' me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel; it's true to the heart
She rides with me--the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during ""Sex and the City""
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together--how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend

The problem is you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
Dat ain't 'bout nothin
If ever you mad about somethin', it won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no, you won't see that
And, no, I ain't perfect; nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But, girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' at Hermes, Birkin' bag
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry--only worry is him
She'd do anything necessary for him
And I'd do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yup

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend

(Talk to 'em, B)
If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you if somebody hurts you
Even if the somebody was me
(Break it down for 'em, B)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend

Why is you over here lookin' at me
While all these girls up in here?

What you gay? Nigga Jay straight like Indian hair
Why'all don't want me to spray the semi in here
I mean if you a fan I consider you fam'
But shake a nigga hand, but shit god damn
All that (""Do you remember me dawg?"") Nah I'm drawin' a blank
You got me feelin' like a fish, in a fish tank
Just think, if you came to a club
Tryin' to find a little hon for some one-night love
'Stead you got another nigga all up in your mug
You make me uncomfortable thug, go thatta-way!
And kill the ice grill homes
'Cause I keep enough heat to melt that away
I came in some sweats, I came to get met
Tryin' to find a chick that make it hard for me to ""next!""
We exit stage left, hope in the Lexus
Treat me like a baby, mouth on her breast-es
May I suggest that it's

Go get your dance on, go grind on one, damn
Go find you one

So many hoes in here

There's so many hoes in here
I understand you got issues but I really don't care
There's so many hoes in here

Yea, yea, yea I know you rap and your sister spit too
You been callin' the office and you can't get through
I understand all that, but now ain't the time
I came to the club to get that off my mind
And all you thugs with your war stories startin' to bore me
I ain't tryin' to hear about your guts and glory
I'm tryin' to hear B.I.G. and some cuts from Nore
And you keep talkin' over the beat like Clue (""Do you remember?"")
Go find somethin' to do
You're a janitor, go find somethin' to screw
Disappear like Copperfield, go cop a feel
Play hide and seek witchaself for real, huh
The chick came dressed up just to get messed up
She got her hair done, just to get it sweated up
Shit I'm tryin' to help her out
Why on'tcha help me out and be out?

Jeah, jeah, jeah

You're invadin' my space
You need to, be easy, ahh

Heh, I don't understand

Your heart beating so fast speeding his pulse up
Yeah i know it sucks, Life ain't a rose bud
A couple of speed bumps
You gotta take your lumps
Off to Bootcamp, the worlds facing terror
Bin Laden been happening in Manhatten
Crack was anthrax back then, back when
Police was Al'Qaeda to black men
While I was out there hustling sinning with no religion
He was off the wall killing for a living

[Chorus]

Days turn to nights, nights turn to years
Years turn to ""how the fuck we make it in here?""
My barracks average couple fights a day
Get you locked in a hole won't see the light of day
And I feel like I'm just writing my life away
I never thought shit could end up quite this way
There's a war going on outside no man is safe from
I'm here for the good fight only the fakes run
I'm here for the purple heart, if I can't take one
For my team or my siblings what's my reason for living?
I love my niggas more then anything else
This war's about my family, me needin the wealth
You don't understand how useless as men we felt
Till you become a 5 star general
Shout out to my niggas that's locked in jail
P.O.W.'s that's still in the war for real

[Chorus]

Your baby boy is getting grown
So your baby boy is moving on
I've gotta chase (gotta chase it)
If I'm gonna make it (gonna make it)
Your baby boy is getting grown
So your baby boy is moving on
I'm gonna make it
Even if I gotta take it (gotta take it)

Mama said pray your sons becoming a man
This wars taxing to 'em like Uncle Sam
Hear the noise make the right choice, understand
Every choice that he make he makes it for his fam
It's death before dishonor
And if he's gone you should honor his memory
don't cry we all gonna die eventually
But if he's locked in the penitentiary send him some energy
They all winners to me
(What's up kid?)

What, y'all niggas get front page articles?
Y'all mention JAY-Z name?
(This thing on?) JAY-Z, JAY-Z
In JAY-Z news (Check)
I understand what y'all tryin' to do
I brought the flutes this time, though (Check)
Unleash the flutes on 'em, Guru
Give me some more music in the headphone
Let's get to the proceedings preceding this evening
Let's do this thing (let's do it right this time)
C'mon!

H, O, V, A, I got my mojo back, baby, oh behave
Naw, naw, don't be afraid, y'all and your articles hock spit at Jay
Y'all from afar threw darts my way
What you thought, I would not have nothin' to say? Nope!
Y'all fell into the booby trap
I set the trap just to see dude react
And now, and now you's can't leave
You opened the door, God, I'm at you annually
And I'm sorry Miss Rosie Perez
I call a spade a spade, it just is what it is
But you can't give cred to anything dude says
Same dude to give you ice and you owe him some head
Shorty, it's time to wake up the dead
You sound a little naive in them articles that I read

Can't y'all see that he's fake, the rap version of T.D. Jakes
Prophesizin' on your CD's and tapes
Won't break you a crumb of the little bit that he makes
And this is with whom you want to place your faith
I put dollars on mine, ask Columbine
When the Twin Towers dropped, I was the first in line
Donatin' proceeds off every ticket sold
When I was out on the road, that's how you judge Hov, no?
Ain't I supposed to be absorbed in myself?
Every time there's a tragedy, I'm the first one to help
They call me this misogynist, but they don't call me the dude
To take his dollars to give gifts at the projects
These dudes is all politics, depositin' checks
They put in they pocket, all you get in return is a lot of lip
And y'all buy the shit, caught up in the hype
'Cause the nigga wear a kufi, it don't mean that he bright
'Cause you don't understand him, it don't mean that he nice
It just means you don't understand all the bullshit that he write
Is it Oochie Wally Wally or is it One Mic?
Is it Black Girl Lost or shorty owe you for ice?
I've been real all my life, they confuse it with conceit
Since I will not lose, they try to help him cheat
But I will not lose, for even in defeat
There's a valuable lesson learned, so it evens up for me
When the grass is cut, the snakes will show
I gotta thank the little homie Nas for that though
Savin' me the hassle of speakin' to half of these assholes
And I'ma let karma catch up to Jaz-O, whoa
I'm back before you had a chance to miss me
My mama can't save you this time, niggas is history
Who you know flow vicious as me?
Yet so religiously, that's why they call me Hov'
I get the spoils 'cause the victor is me (Me, nigga!)
You're an actor, you're not who you're depicted to be
You street dreamin', all y'all niggas livin' through me
I gave you life when niggas was forgettin' you emcee
I'm a legend, you should take a picture with me
You should be happy to be in my presence
I should charge you a fee
I'm Big Dog, Glenn Rob, listen, God, you a flea
And the little homie Jungle is a garden to me
What's the problem, B? You not as hard as me, nigga
Hard as we, nigga, R-O-C, nigga
That's why they follow me, they feel my pain and my agony, nigga

Couldn't even be stopped by Bin Laden
So September 11th marks the era forever
Of a revolutionary Jay Guevero

Everybody duping the flow, you see 'em
Everybody looping up soul
It's like you trying to make ""The Blueprint 2"" before Hov'
Shout out to Just Bleezy and, Kan-yeezy
See how we adjusted the game so easy
Chicks barely dancing, glancing every chance they get
Like, oh shit, he's so handsome
Still in demand in the longest run standing
Kidnap rap seven years, no ransom
Can't one nigga get it back no rap
Young Hov's goin to Canton, I'm now eligible

Point out the bounce, and show you how to get this dough in

Point out the bounce, I turn a 8 to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R.O.C.
Point out the bounce, Timbo the king nigga
Yeah
Point out the bounce, yeah, Young Hov' the king nigga

I got why'all

For those that think Hov' fingers bling bling'n
Either haven't heard the album or they don't know English
They only know what the single is, and singled that out
To be the meaning of what he is about
And being I'm about my business, not mingling much
Running my mouth, that shit kept lingering
But no dummy, that's the shit I'm sprinkling
The album width to keep the registers ringing
In real life, I'm much more distinguished
I'm like a bloke from London, England
Yeah, you jingling baby
See I go right back and I bring 'em in baby
Business mind of a Ross Perot, but never lost my soul
Crossed the line, I bought pop across the row
Then I walk through the hood, where they up to no good
Slanging them O's like a real O.G. should
Oh, he's good, no he would never sell out he's so young

Point out the bounce, and show you how to get this dough in

Billboard, pop star, neighborhood block star

Ask me, ""Rey-Rey, is that yo' car?""
I seen MTV, I know who you are
You did ""Takeover,"" do you got beef with Nas?
I did take over the game, brought back the soul
Got tracks to go, got plaques that's gold
Platinum to go, yeah that's the flow

I snatched purses I per-se-vered, yeah
I had work, fiends purchased, it was clear
I was out there selling hope for despair, but stop there
I swear, I only make good from my mouth to God's ears
Had to get out the hood
And I can't justify genocide

Born in the city where the skinny niggaz ride

This is what was said

Had a dream I said, bout who he said?
'Bout B.I.G. I said, that's big he said
Dig he said, proceed he said
Indeed I said, so, breathe I did
Don't repeat what I say I said, he said nothing
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes I repeated what was said
It came to me like a well as even I said
""You feel playboy,"" was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?
""More money, more problems, better believe it,"" he said
""Careful what you wish for you might receive it,"" he said
I see I said, jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said
Then B.I. said, ""Hov' remind yourself
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself""

Hanging pictures on my wall

I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock 
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match

Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight

Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner

Y'all don't see, clearly cause the reign ain't gone
""The Dynasty,"" no not Ming but Shawn's
Dame careens, nigga it's the gangsta team
Stop your run, one of the reasons that they call us gangrene
The other reason, we got a gang of green
If there's better at getting cheddar that remains to be seen, nigga

Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)

Can't move the unmovable, stop the unstoppable..

Yeah, look
I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm bout to start another life
Look behind you, I'm bout to pass you twice
Back to the future and gotta slow up for the present
I'm fast, niggas can't get past my past
How they propose to deal with my perfect present?
When I unwrap ""The Gift & the Curse"" in one session
Ain't no living person can test him
Only two resting in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
Seven straight summers, critics might not admit it
But nobody in rap did it, quite like I did it
If you did it I done it before, you get I had it
Got mad at it and don't want it no more
And that goes for everything from flipping that raw
Flipping whores, flipping vocal chords, don't get it twisted
Get it right, did different, did it better, did it nice
Did the impossible then did it twice (get it right)

Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)

Yup! Hovi's home, the global phone
The world is back in order the number one rap recorder is back
You cats over felt yourself
You couldn't help yourself, now witness the reel for reel
In my absence cats get, absent-minded
Now it's time to rewind and remind 'em
Why I'm in the position that I am
Changing the game, my game could nail Madonna
Well after I'm gone, they'll honor
History in the making, Pistol Pete
Leave competition shaking without missing the beat
Chasing the hi-hat all over the track
The snare is scared of the air in here, boom!
And plus I get paper dog, don't let me forget
The watch face so blue like it's holding it's breath
Can't see me skill for skill or check for check
It's the bow tie flow dog, I bring it to your neck
Live and correct I will bring it to your set
I got now, I don't care who got next
Rapper slash exec, Kordell Stewart
Your flow all y'all using is mine, you're all useless
You ain't a factor, who are you fooling?
You all are fagots, you taking it backwards (taking it backwards)
I'm trying to progress with this rap shit
Nigga, nigga your whole career is a accident
Who was gassing 'em? (Fuck outta here!)

Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable

Jay-Z,"Now, the end is near (Can you believe this shit Guru?)
So I face (I'm from the hood man) the final curtain
(No the real hood the hood, not the RAP hood)
(The real hood, like three pair of pants)
My friends, I'll say it clear (pair of sneakers)
(My moms is busting her ass) State my case
(Nigga I'm going to Japan tomorrow!) Which I'm certain
(You understand what I'm saying? Can you believe that?)
I lived a life that's full (They have people, waiting)
(At the airport like five days like I'm a beetle or something)
(That's really something!) And I traveled each, and every highway
(Seen the best of the best, the worst of the worst) and more
Much more than this (still here) I did it my way
Let's try this one

Uhh, yeah, gangsta nigga!
Put my hustle down, tore the game up nigga
Took your high score down, put my name up nigga
Tore the doors down 'til the Hall of Fame is Jigga
I did it my way (and more.. much more than this)
That's right, it's a beautiful thing man!
(I did it my way) I did it my way, Hovi baby!

Momma's youngest and strongest, survived summers like saunas
Mastered a corner like Deion in his uniform
Pop hurting assertive, flirted with death
Damn near murdered before my first album hit the shelf
Grandma's favorite, she could not understand
How there's people in the world who wouldn't want me as a neighbor
Has to explain to her, you think these folks want me in the penthouse
As a reminder that I make top paper?
Black entrepreneur, nobody did us no favors
Nobody gave us shit, we made us
The Rap Pack, I'm Sinatra, Dame's Sam Davis
Big's the smart one on the low like Dean Martin
We came in this game, not begging niggas pardon
Demanding y'all respect, hand over a check
And while y'all at it, hand over the jet
We the reason they ain't hand over Def Jam so quick
They new every year I was dropping new product
I was raisin the stock up, while building the Roc up
But that's alright, cause they knew they had to see us
When it was time for us to re-up, make us multi-million-ires
Yeah!

(And more, much more than this; I did it my way)
Yeah! ""In My Lifetime""
I caught smaller cases, but I had capital
Hypocritic system let me right back at you
You better hope a rich rapper never attacks you
Not even that scratches you, 'specially if you black dude
They don't give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap
And they can look good by painting him as bad news
Cause in my past, I seen dudes get half of they views
Exposed to the curb and nobody said a word
So imagine how disturbed I was
When I seen how big they made my fight scene at the club
Let me explain exactly how this shit was
This nigga yo I scratched him, he went home without an aspirin
But it's cool cause he's back friends, and half-inning is over
It's in the past and I'm glad, now I'm back to being Hova
Me back with the chauffeur, laid back
Helicopter seat, feat inclined, shit feeling like a sofa
Helicopter meet me, Teta Vero take me over
Somewhere peaceful for the weekend now it's back to speaking of vultures
So the next time that page six approaches us
Here's a quote from Jay, nigga I did it my, way

(And more, much more than this, I did it my way)",I Did It My Way,2002
Jay-Z,"Woo!
It's ""The gift and the curse""
Yea
First they love me then they hate me then they love me again
They love me again
Let's take a trip down, I gotcha

Let's take a trip down memory, lane at the cemetery
Rain gray skies, seems at the end of every
Young black life is this line, ""Damn, him already?
Such a good kid,"" got us pouring Henn' already
Liquor to the curb for my, niggas up above
When it, cracks through the pavement that's my way of sending love
So, give Big a hug, tell Aaliyah I said hi
Till the next time I see her, on the other side
He was just some thug that, caught some slugs
And we loved him cause, in him we, saw some of us
He walked like us, talked like us
His back against the wall, nigga fought like us, damn
Poor Isis, that's his momma name
Momma ain't strong enough to raise no boy, what's his father name?
Shorty never knew him, though he had his blood in him
Hot temper, momma said he act just like her husband
Daddy never fucked with him, so the streets raised him
Isis blaming herself, she wish she could of saved him
Damn near impossible, only men can raise men
He was his own man, not even him can save him
He put his faith in her, thirty-eight in his waist
But when you live by the gun you die by the same fate
End up, dead before thirty-eight and umm
That's the life of us raised by winter, it's a cold world
Old girl turned to coke, tried to smoke her pain away
Isis, life just, ended on that rainy day
When she got the news her boy body could be viewed
Down at the City Morgue, opened the drawer, saw him nude
Her addiction grew, prescription drugs, shift and brew
Angel dust, dipped in WOO!
She slipped into, her own fantasy world
Had herself pregnant by a different dude
But reality bites and, this is her life
He wasn't really her husband, though he called her wife
It was just this night when, moon was full
And the stars were just right, and the dress was real tight
Had her sounding like Lisa Lisa, I wonder if I take you home
Will you still love me after this night?
Mike was the hard head from the around the way
That she wanted all her life, shit she wanted all the hype
Used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike
He was a Willie all her life he wasn't really the one to like
It was a, dude named Shy who would really treat her right
He wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
But I-sis, like this, Broadway life
She loved the Gucci sneakers, the red green and whites
Hanging out the window when she first seen him fight
She was so turned on that she had to shower twice
How ironic it would, be some fight that
Turned into a homicide that'll alter their life
See Mike at thirty-two was still on the scene
Had a son fifteen that he never saw twice
Sure he saw him as an infant, but he dissed on him like
""If that was my son, he would look much different.
See I'm light-skinnded and that baby there's dark
So it's, momma's baby, poppa's maybe.""
Mike was still crazy out there running the streets (fuck niggas want?)
Had an older but light with thirty-eight gun in his reach
It's been fourteen years, him and Isis ain't speak
He running around like life's a peach, 'til one day
He approached this thug that, had a mean mug
And it looked so familiar that he called him ""Young Cuz""
Told him, get off the strip but the boy ain't budge (fuck you)
Instead he pulled out a newer thirty-eight snub
He clearly had the drop but the boy just paused (hold up)
There was something in this man's face he knew he seen before
It's like, looking in the mirror seeing his self more mature
And he took it as a sign from the almighty Lord
You know what they say about he who hesitates in war
(What's that?) He who hesitates is lost
He can't explain what he saw before his picture went blank
The old man didn't think he just followed his instinct
Six shots into his kid, out of the gun
Niggas be a father, you're killing your son
Six shots into his kid, out of the gun
Niggas be a father, you killing your sons

I'm surprised I got so much dough to spend
But, back when I was poorer then
You wasn't focusin', about the dough I spend
But I was holdin in, I was a roller then
I was a baller back then, all of that man
Fall back, I fought that

Onn the glimmer with the glock by the ball
Servin' up a jab and workin' security six to six
Then it's straight from the block to the mall
Now what's on the wall? Go ahead and treat yo'self
When you come up on some cheddar better pop that tag
Like when I dip off in the Prada then I go off
to the lot lay the paper down and cop that Jag
I got a console full of ammunition and funds
Mink Roc-a-Wear and some guns
Petty in a fresh pair of jumps, blo-packs and Bo Jax
and Air Maxes, throw back some ones, no max for none
(When I go up in the sto' a nigga never get enough)
I'm a baller and if you want it come and get it now
(Nigga come to a race with a car you won't catch up)
And the Twista kinda wicked when I spit it now

Chop a little cheddar up with Jay
Chop it up with the O-to-the-Kizay

Keep a glock that will shock and bring the rest
tucked underneath my Michelin S
I, travellin', handlin' with a forty-five cannon
It's tucked in my Marc Buchanan
Extra clips and shells in the lambskin
Two deep by Pelle Pelle
Westside how they felly fell
More G's on me, than a late 80's Gucci leather
Worn by the great Rakim himself
Stitch my Dapper Dan oh man with the gun in hand
I leave your blood squirting
No offense, I'll put your face on the chest of a sweatshirt drawn by Shirt Kings
I been fucking, a hustle, married to a racket
Since the first Air Jordan's and Starter jackets
I slept with a package, under mattress
I carry guns heavy speakeasy, slight with the fight words
I'll put somethin' hot through your motherfuckin' iceberg
Got a project chica, named Rica
She keep a purse full of dro' reefer
Small, pinkies like that
Talk 'til the paper fat
I rock somethin', roll chief Sacks like Daddy Fat!

Pop tires in reverse, you'll be needin' a nurse
Leave you layin on your back in a Cadillac hearse
Now your momma in all black with a matchin' purse
I know you want to blow up, but a funeral hurts
What's worse, you can hit the mall and ball 'til you fall
Have to make a collect call, but your cell cut off
Trot to the mailbox thinkin' a check but the mail's run short
No more MD, DD, LD
That means movie date, dinner date, lunch date, help me please

My sheets is gone
Long bread to the short bread, word is bond
Meticulously pimpously serve the song
Act a damn donkey

Drop top rag-o with the weed gone
Chillin', bags in the trunk full of FEO Schwartz for the chill'uns
Spent a few shillings
Sip a few chickens, lick a few kittens, just kiddin'
A fresh bowl of milk is in the fridge and
Can you pop the tags on the honeycombs
Or are you actin' mad 'cause the money done
Slowed, down, just a little bit
Dipped, poked out, did some shull-bit
Actin' like a pitfall bull-pit
Dead game is the pul-pit
Leave a motherpumper with his John Doe toe tag clipped
Imperial classic, a lyrical thrashin'

Behind smoke kids can't chase the ice cream truck

Girls fighting over Rollie young boys hype things up
Niggas fighting over Cold young boys light things up
All the petty ass wars fuck the night scene up
Remember Lil' Eddie man how he light mean up

Then they wonder why we light green up
Back to back steamers trying to relax but I can't
I lean up ain't the L or the refer that steam up
It's my head stress to the point I get a fever

Thinking bout the block and all the mothers and kids
That can't leave and how the Chinks gotta feed'em
For the rest of their life fucking wings fried
Vegetable rice(gotta be kidding)

No breakfast Cap'n Crunch at night
Our kids eating lunch at night
In their beds all bunched in tight
No less than three or four(you know how it go)

Two by the foot two by the headboard
Man I'm getting scared for them (Yeah I know)
that's how I feel for them

We know tomorrow ain't promise so we get that there

Working inside a slump house starving to death
Serving these nigga flippers, quarter-ounces and

Zippers agents snapping your picture neighbors
Plotting to get ya
Situations is critic I was out here to get it
Living it like a savage cause nigga I gotta have it

And holding back all the mothers for a minute

Erase enough to walk it down and fuck it all dog

I'm back, stronger than ever, surprise surprise
They try to take me out the game, but I's alive
It's like a old negro spiritual, but I mastered Tobey
With a splash of Monster Kody, shoot faster than Kobe, nigga
You bastards know me, the one and only
Big homey from the Roc, I think you pastors lonely
You need Jesus in your life, it's either that
Or y'all gon' make me put the double Desert Eagles in your life, nigga!

Jealousy's a weak emotion, y'all gotta overcome that man
(Some people kill their brothers)
See'mon man be stronger than that, you know what I think?
(I think they've lost their minds) You'll be aight though

Au contrary nigga, I am here cause I earned the shit
By ridin' out, when niggas had learner's permit
We bring the knives out, or we let them burners spit
I bring them pies out if niggas want to burn the strip
Bring your rides out, bring your buggy eyes out, turn your six
I laid back in the ?
Nigga this the payback, I know you bitch niggas from way back
Niggas want to clown but the pound it don't play that
Get yourself found, drowned, where the lake at
Run up on 'em, Notoriously, ""Take that!"" (take that)
And then we comin' where your wake at
Eight maniac cats strapped with gats, you can hate that
Face facts, fake rap cats
Can't take back what I took back to the Brook, look

And it just get worser, every time I write my signature in cursive
Just add another million to these verses
One million, two million, three million, four
And the money's really worthless, I'm pissing you off on purpose

That's how I live for a living nigga (watcher)
Okay, let's do this (the watcher)

Things just ain't the same for gangsters
But I'm a little too famous to shoot these pranksters
All of these rap singers claiming they bangers
Doing all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
Disrespecting the game, no home training or manners
I was doing this shit when you was shitting Pampers
I was moving them grams 'fore you, knew what a hand that hand was
Ducking the vans, radars, the scanners
'Fore you knew what hard white to tame was
I was hitting the turnpike, aight with the bammers
I was nice with my hands, cuss aight with them hammers
I was pricking my finger 'fore you knew what a Fam was
I had it laid out before you knew what a plan was
Three hundred mill' later, now you understand us
Y'all ain't see us coming through Vegas
You ever seen so much cham' bust in one night
Grand fucked up one fight
I was on the Peter Pan bus
You was Peter Pan up in your room, y'all fucking with whom?
Allowed me to be taught
You cowards is just now learning the shit that we talk
You niggas ain't know about a Robb Report
Bout a high speed Porsche, i.e.
You niggas ain't know how to floss 'til I came through the door
like ""Eric B. for Pres,"" respect me in this bitch!
You can't disrespect us cause you got a little check cut
You was sucking for so long, fucking your little neck up
Now you too big for your britches, you got a few little bitches
You think you Hugh Hefner, you just ridiculous
I blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game
It's only right I got the right to be king
Niggaz that got life really like what I sing
Cause they know is he really like, niggas feel my pain
Know the shit I DON'T write be the illest shit that's ever been recited
in the game word to the hyphen in my name!
J, A, Y, DASH, Hoffa
The past present nigga the future, proper
The holy trinity of hip-hop is us
We give, Dre his props BUT that's where it stops
It's the Roc

[Chorus]
I know, you got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
(Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as before)
(People I used to know, just don't know me no mo')
(But everywhere that I go, I got people I know)
(Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)

I'm still on top of the game
Still dropping flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top had the Roc for the fame
over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came
You seen it all, how I got, how I gained
The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
the streets, they made a special spot for my name
Dre, haters wanna stop to my reign
But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain
All the way back from the rise of my name
See the world clear through the eyes of the mane
See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave
When the beat bangs it'll drive them insane
The eyes that I played
The best to emerge in the game is The Watcher

[Chorus]

I'm ""Rated R,"" my brain contains graphics things
It turn traumatic teens into addicts, and fiends
It's like, watching a movie through a panoramic screen
Which means, I can see the whole planet in the scene
Cash is the topic, the object, a fatter pocket
Some take the crack and chop it, but those that haven't got it
take away the added profit, it's catastrophic
I take the gat and cock it, and I'll sit back and watch it
These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully
The world is mine and can't nobody keep it from me
Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny
In the place where the number one cause of death is money
You can try coping
I've seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
I'm still alive and scoping
Be another hundred years 'til my skies close in
And I'ma die with my eyes open, the watcher

Don't make me have to relapse on these hoes

Straight from the oven with it, came from the dirt
I emerged from it all without a stain on my shirt
You can blame my old earth, for the shit she instilled in me
Still with me, pain plus work
Shit she made me milk this game for all it's worth
That's right, these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm calling guts every time, drag my nuts every time
Homey, we make a great combination don't we?
Me and the Face Mob, every time we face-off
Face it y'all, y'all niggas playing basic ball

Don't got no wholesale, cause that ain't how I wanna run it
Here take these five stones and bring a nigga back a hundred
Gotta see my feet dude, you do shit a fiend do
The fire get too hot in the kitchen, I hit the streets fool
Money is an issue, and that's on the fa' shizzle my nizzle
Ya block warm, then I come by with the fizzle
And make fa' sho' I get to work mines, for part of the time
We go to war and you ain't making a dime (ha ha!)

You can make ya chips swell up, ya don't have to pitch
Play them corners like a safety, watch the traffic switch
Young'n never pump fake, and you'll get past the blitz
And keep ya whole hood on flip, like on box-spring

Strictly glassy shit, I hug the block like a quart of water
Shit I used to hug a corner like a old deuce and a quarter
Till like deuce in the morning, with the old heads

Everybody's like, ""He's no item! Please don't like him.
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!""
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not having that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin' along
With a flashy nigga bragging on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in ""The Matrix""

You're so contagious, I can't take it have my baby, let's just make it

Lady! What's your name?
So foxy girl, you're so hot to trot

Love let's go half on a son, I know my past ain't one
You can easily get past, but that chapter is done
But I'm done reading for now
Remember spades face up, you can believe him for now
But ma you got a for real f'serious role
I'm bout to give you all the keys and security codes
'Bout to show you where the cheese, let you know I ain't playing
But, before I jump out the window, what's your name?

Excuse me, damn!

What you think?  I don't wanna have to spray down this bitch
Call my whole team, from around the way down this bitch
I'm tryin to stay down this bitch, play down this bitch
Had a sound, so my nigga Jay drown the six
Roll the windows down and, weight round this bitch
But there's a couple things 'fore it's OK round this bitch
Gotta talk to the natives, let em know I'm here
For all to get the paydays, first I line up all the haters
I got jobs for ya, drop stars for ya
More arms than Green Bay's Brett Favre for ya
Money providentials hope that's not a problem for ya
If so, Jigga be here, day after tomorrow for ya (That's right!)

A down ass bitch and she down to click
Got a nice little hooptie that I get around with
And my plan is, not to leave this town til I'm rich
Gotta find a nigga sellin all them ounces and shit
Tell them get down with the click or get found in a ditch
See I drop down and strip, I turn around and spit
Not to hit em, just to let em know the sound of shit
Return later that evening in the club with Fox
And I got the snub nosed for those that love to box
I'm in search of them young niggaz that hug the block
All day, til it's like gray outside
Shoot dice talkin shit all day outside
And even when it's hot, they outside

I ain't got it to give but I got it to test
And if you wanna get down, all you gotta invest
Is your time, I gotta move this in a, week or less
For the next couple of days I brought her all I possess
The Rolex, necklaces with the VVS
Twin to drive in the passenger with a TV rest
For my top draft picks I cop the new GS
Now all the little soldiers wanna roll with my team
Cause I ain't sold em a dream, I just showed em the cream
Picked em up in the afternoons and told em some things
You know the regular shit you do when you moldin them teens
Yo, never lay your head where you holdin them things
From family, to your business, nothing goes in between
Never feared no man, put four in his Beem

Roc-a-Fella, LOX, takin the streets over motherfuckers
Don't get it twisted
Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
Yo shut the fuck up 'fore I blast and Banned From TV your ass
With no mask, look at the camera like what?
Yeah I did it like them sick white boys the court committed
To the death of me, I'm spaz like I'm on Ecstasy
Drop 100 bars for real like I'm lookin for a deal
If I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids
I ain't straight til my numbers match the Motorola ?bid?
And walk the streets up in ? ? like I don't fuckin care
If I ain't strapped that means I took em off my Nike Airs
Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children
When I ride mine like bitched when I walk up in the building
Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores
Jet-skiin, while you keep warm at corner stores
I make it hot, floodin your block, the best way
Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray
As I get roasted lookin at Biggie posted on my wall
Takin shots of Louie til I fall
Nuttin to lose, just load the clip up in the groove
And kick rhymes to the poster, til I swear Big move
My team, you would think was on Thorazine
How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's cost-ing

Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now
Pick out a quiet town and tie it down
Make niggaz lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now
Beanie Mac I supply it now
My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats
Couple of five's, a six, a few Jeeps
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks
In case niggaz wanna test, vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name?  And test my game?
Until you have me, test my aim?
Y'all niggaz nuts, like testricles
Hit you up in your apartment buildin vestibule
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walkin
Heat from the noggin, keep on sparkin
Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparklin
Cop off the lot never see me at the auction
Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawkin
Out on the strip, until I reach the margin
Not tryin to meet the Seargeant, at the precinct
Eatin cheese sandwiches, down for the weekend
Locked up with dirty white boys and Ricans

Now if I kill you I probably do ten in the box
Come down on appeal then I'm killin your pops
You feelin The LOX, nigga why you grillin The LOX
If this rap shit don't work niggaz still in the spot
You bring it to me, I gotta lose your family
Gangstas don't die, they get chubby, and move to Miami
Shit is deep now dog but it gets deeper
Fuck it, the weather's nice and the price is much cheaper
I put it on tape, you gon' buy it, I put it in a bag
You gon' try it, y'all niggaz can't deny it
Lot of cats still tryin to study my last bounce
Tell you what, get a beat tape and a half ounce
They got me where I can't be without my large gat
Teflon long sleeve, and my hardhat
Don't matter if I'm openin up, or headline
Doin the speed limit or pushin red lines
Six months in the county or fed time
I'ma be the 'Kiss nigga, until it's bedtime
Anything I'm on is a classic, any nigga
Ever had beef with, son is a bastard
Anytime I spit, spit acid, L.O.X.
Ruffryder you heard?  We got the game mastered

I told you the pain was comin
You wouldn't listen
You tried to play me like a joke?
Now who got the last laugh?
Now take these bullets with you to hell

You motherfuckers is sick, don't think Sauce the shit
So many niggaz on my nuts I thought I lost my dick
Picture me fallin off, I'm camera shy
Hammers fly, might miss you, but your man'll die
What's the difference?  Either way I'm stunnin your crew
I fuck to win, y'all niggaz comin to lose
Somethin to prove?  Spit it, we can have a sprayoff
I lay off wet niggaz and kill em on my day off
Ain't nuttin for me to bust a trey off
Murder the whole month of April nigga, just to take May off
Run with more Germans than Adolf, you light crews
Now I concentrate on your camp, like Jews
Flow hot like a heatwave bitch
Whips fatter than them shits they beat slaves with
I'm a meal stackin nigga who pull quick, still packin
For you Phil Jackson niggaz on that Bull

I don't give a fuck who you are, so fuck who you are
I don't care about a pretty bitch, watch or a car
I don't care about your block and whoever you shot
I don't care about your album and whenever it drop
I don't care about your past if I did I woulda asked
I'm too busy lightin 'dro with a whole lotta hash
Far as this rap shit, I'm ten steps ahead of niggaz
Shootin backwards, just for practice
Ride or die nigga, hoppin in your casket
Bout to go to hell with you, blow the L with you
Tell the whole world I'm spittin let em know the shells hit you
I tell niggaz quick, suck dick and get a glock
My name ring bells like Sunday at twelve o'clock
I'm half past seven, bust six then eleven
You know me, slide my man my joint say reload me
I ruffryde and pop a fella for Roc-a-Fella
Jay (what the fuck) spendin mozzarella

I know pop you can't stand us cause you cock them hammers
Run in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma
Locked in the slammer?  Nope, popped up in Atlanta
Crossed up in a drop I popped up the antenna
Whoa, watch your manners when my veins pop like scanners
Like raindrops you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon
Big thang, big chains, ain't shit changed
Get brained in the four dot six Range
Shit main, switch lanes
Every town I hit, switch planes, bitch flipped big caine
Flow with no cut, you take it in vain/vein to the brain
Muh'fukas is noddin and throwin up, you know that
You don't wanna owe that man
He'll hit you, get the picture?  Kodak man
Gotta, love for war, I don't floss no more
I just sit on my money til I'm above the law
How the fuck you gonna stop us with your measly asses
We don't stop at the tolls we got EZ passes, nigga

Iceberg sweat with I.B. on the elastic

That's right
Uh-huh-uh, it was all good just a week ago
Last week I had everything
Uh, uh-huh-uh, had this all good just a week ago
I had the money, had the cars, the bitches
Uh-huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago
And the jewelry,
And then my motherfucking niggas started snitching
Uh-huh, uh uh, yo
Bitch!

Growing up in the hood just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for, all to see
Problems, I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Met him unlocked doors, off my keys
Yeah we spoke, much more than cordially
Man he broke bread with me, my business spreads with me
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
He's talkin' reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said, ""Damn dog, what, nine weeks and you're home?""
He said, ""Main man, you think shit's sweet cause you're home.""
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
The crackers up there bleaching your dome, you're reaching
I said, ""The world don't stop I've got to keep keep on.""
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spot, store to add some more features to my phone
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
Can't be too safe cause niggas is two-faced
And they show the other side when they catch a new case
It's on

It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago)

Funny what, seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip now you dropping names
Uh-huh, uh-huh (It was all good just a week ago)

Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell
We both came in this game, blind as hell
I did a little better, had more clientele
Told you put away some cheddar now you crying for bail
Seventeen and I'm holding on to around a mill
I could bail out and blow trial and come around on the pill
Had niggas thinking I was from Uptown for real
I had so much hustle plus I was down to ill
Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville
Down and dirty, down to fight the round thirty
Freezing on them corners still holding my crack
Looking up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?
Came from flat broke to letting the dough stack
You tell them feds I said I'm never going back
I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious

It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago)

Funny what, seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip now you dropping names
Uh-huh, uh-huh (It was all good just a week ago)

The lawyer I retained you said you leaking some things
All this after a week in the bang
I'm mad at myself cause I didn't spot the weak and lame
I would of bet the house you wouldn't speak a thing
Nigga this was the oath, to the top of broke
Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us
We sposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?
Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry
That's right, the same game that make you mad could make you die
It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap
Who would of thought you'd get popped one time and rap?
Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad
And your son gotta grow up like, ""This is my dad?""
The labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
You'll always be in jail nigga, just minus the bars

It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago)

Funny what, seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip now you dropping names
Uh-huh, uh-huh (It was all good just a week ago)

Shit is crazy man
All these niggas out here snitching
We was one step away from taking this crack money
And recycling it through the ghettos
And building back up our own hoods
Now all you niggas start snitching on each other
I got partners doing 15-20
Wouldn't to been doing SHIT
If you didn't snitch
Bitch!
It's about time y'all check that shit out man
It ain't all good
Shut your mouth

And don't snitch
It sure will do a lot for you

Welcome to the Jay-Z extravaganza
I'd like to introduce my band right now
Just Blaze and the Blazettes, hehe
Right now I want you to give the drummer some
No ma really, give the drummer some

Touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakable (it's Hovi baby)
Yeah, unbreakable
Rock the unrockable (it's Hovi baby)

Follow the flow, look
They say a midget standing on the giant's shoulder can see much
Further than the giant (the giant)
So I got the WHOLE rap world on my shoulder they tryin to see
Further than I am (than I am)
And I have been trying to be patient with they preoccupation
With David and Goliath (Goliath)
But sooner or later, that patience gonna run it's course
And I'm forced to be a tyrant (be a tyrant)
But being tyrant, coming through your environment
Iron mask, nigga iron gas, nigga I am back
With ""The Team,"" no I in that
R.O.C., y'all not eyeing that
Y'all don't see, clearly cause the reign ain't gone
""The Dynasty,"" no not Ming but Shawn's
Dame careens, nigga it's the gangsta team
Stop your run, one of the reasons that they call us gangrene
The other reason, we got a gang of green
If there's better at getting cheddar that remains to be seen, nigga

[Chorus]
Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)

Can't move the unmovable, stop the unstoppable..

Yeah, look
I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm bout to start another life
Look behind you, I'm bout to pass you twice
Back to the future and gotta slow up for the present
I'm fast, niggas can't get past my past
How they propose to deal with my perfect present?
When I unwrap ""The Gift & the Curse"" in one session
Ain't no living person can test him
Only two resting in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
Seven straight summers, critics might not admit it
But nobody in rap did it, quite like I did it
If you did it I done it before, you get I had it
Got mad at it and don't want it no more
And that goes for everything from flipping that raw
Flipping whores, flipping vocal chords, don't get it twisted
Get it right, did different, did it better, did it nice
Did the impossible then did it twice (get it right)

[Chorus]

Yup! Hovi's home, the global phone
The world is back in order the number one rap recorder is back
You cats over felt yourself
You couldn't help yourself, now witness the reel for reel
In my absence cats get, absent-minded
Now it's time to rewind and remind 'em
Why I'm in the position that I am
Changing the game, my game could nail Madonna
Well after I'm gone, they'll honor
History in the making, Pistol Pete
Leave competition shaking without missing the beat
Chasing the hi-hat all over the track
The snare is scared of the air in here, boom!
And plus I get paper dog, don't let me forget
The watch face so blue like it's holding it's breath
Can't see me skill for skill or check for check
It's the bow tie flow dog, I bring it to your neck
Live and correct I will bring it to your set
I got now, I don't care who got next
Rapper slash exec, Kordell Stewart
Your flow all y'all using is mine, you're all useless
You ain't a factor, who are you fooling?
You all are fagots, you taking it backwards (taking it backwards)
I'm trying to progress with this rap shit
Nigga, nigga your whole career is a accident
Who was gassing 'em? (Fuck outta here!)

Everybody's like, ""He's no item! Please don't like him.
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!""
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not having that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin along
With a flashy nigga bragging on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in ""The Matrix""
But fuck it, let the Fish-burne

You're so contagious, I can't take it have my baby, let's just make it
Excuse me, what's your name?
For the grown and sexy, only for the grown and sexy
Lady! What's your name?
So foxy girl, you're so hot to trot

Love let's go half on a son, I know my past ain't one
You can easily get past, but that chapter is done
But I'm done reading for now
Remember spades face up, you can believe him for now
But ma you got a for real f'serious role
I'm bout to give you all the keys and security codes
'Bout to show you where the cheese, let you know I ain't playing
But, before I jump out the window, what's your name?

Excuse me, damn!
You're so contagious, I can't take it have my baby, let's just make it

Then I wake up to more bullshit
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
Now that I'm successful you'll pull this shit

Nigga I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
Let's end the speculation, I'm talkin to alla y'all
Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait
Whatchu mad cause you push dimes and he sell weight?

Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy a bigger place
Hehehe, and more baggies, why you all aggie?

Jay-Z,"Man, if I get rocked, this shit for my kids, nigga
It's that real shit

Even though what we do is wrong

We still hustle 'til the sun come up
Crack a 40 when the sun go down
It's a cold winter, y'all niggaz better bundle up
An' I bet it be a hotter summer, grab a onion

Yes, the ROC gets down, you hot now, listen up
Don't you know cops' whole purpose is to lock us down?
An' throw away the key, but without this drug shit
Your kids ain't got no way to eat

We still try to keep Mom smilin'
'cause when the teeth stop showin'
An' the stomach start growlin', then the heat start flowin'
If you from the hood, I know you feel me, keep goin'

If a sneak start leanin' an' the heat stop workin'
Then my heat start workin', I'ma rob me a person
Catch a nigga sleepin' while he out in the open
An' I'ma get him, keep flowin'

We gotta raise our kids while we livin'
Make a million off a record, bail my niggaz outta prison
Fuck a Bentley or a Lexus, just my boys in the squadder
Nigga talk reckless, then I hit 'em with the Smif an'

But I'm never snitchin', I'm a rider
If my kids hungry, snatch the dishes out ya kitchen
I'll be wylin' til they pick me outta line up

We keep the nines tucked, chopped dimes up, rap about it
Wyle out, fuck niggaz up, laugh about it
I'm not tryin' to visit the morgue
But Freeway move out 'til I sit with the Lord

'Til I get my shit together, clean up my sins
Freeway got it in like 10 in the mornin'
An' I can get it to ya like 10 while you yawnin', man

Still deliver the order, man
An' I ain't talkin' 'bout chicken an' gravy, man
I'm talkin' 'bout bricks 'o ye yo, halves an' quarters
4 an' a halves of hash, you do the math

Swing past us, scoop up your daughter
She wanna roll wit' a thug that rap, you do the math
He won't blast 'til my stacks in order

Man, lemme get 'em Free
Hove never slackin', man, zippin' in the black Range
Faster than the red ghost, gettin' ghost wit' Pac, man
One time, know a got a knack to get that change
Leader of the black gang, ROC, man

Bang like T-Mac, ski mask, air it out
Gotta kill witnesses 'cause Free's beard's stickin' out
Y'all don't want no witness shit, we squeeze hammers, man
Bullets breeze by you, like Louisiana, man

But I gotta feed Tianna, man
So I move keys, you can call me the Piano Man
Rain, sleet, hail, snow, man
Slang dough, E, hydro, man

Know B. Sige in the third lane
Gramps still prayin', workin' on my nerves, man
Like, ""Son you gotta get your soul clean
Before they blow them horns like Coltrane""

But still I cry tears of a hustler
Wipe tears from my mother, pull out beers for her brothers
That's above us, make beds for the babies
Tuck kids under covers, buy cribs for their mothers

Shit, I'll probably be wylin' with their fathers
Tell Ms. Robert, tell Enijah that I'm ridin' for her father
That's like my brother, like same mother, different father
Any problems? Dog, know I got 'em

An' still we grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom, sold crack in the alleyways
Still gave back Marcy 'A Dollar Day'
Real gangstas make hood holidays

They ain't thank us but we still paid homage, man
Soul Food Sunday, lookin' like Big Momma's, man
Tell the gang I never break my promise, man, man

Even though what we do is wrong

In the hydro flow that I bought to the game
I could go mo' but I'm a let ma do her thang

When them pockets on ""E"" man you gotta hug that
Corner like you wanna proposal and lock that
Kill a nigga for the scrilla man I'm not above that

[Memphis Bleek]
Hooo! hold on Young, let me get it back
You got beef in these streets, Lord, let me get a gat
Booooy! you now tuned into the greatest
Can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us
Nigga it's nothin, my crew and half dozens
That's cause we scramble, like we Vick's half cousins
Booooy! and get ya mind right nigga
We gon' put you on the news, you want lime light nigga
Channel 2 or Channel 4, you know what 9 like nigga

[Verse 3 - Memphis Bleek]
One - thug in the club, two - models to go
Three - bottles of Arma', four jars of dro
Five shots to draw, my six hits took off
Seven you make Heaven, or eight - everything's a go!
Mami got that ice in ya drink
Long legs short skirt, what you mean - everything's a go!
My thugs outdie of the club wit Timbs
Nine on ya waist, let's roll we gettin in (Everything's a go!)
Nigga I'm back for, I'm willin to clap boy

Roll a ""L"" and burn a incent
It's like magic when I invent
This shit that I present
Yo turn my levels up a izinch
And drop the trebble down the pizinch
And let the bass commence
To relax your nerves
It's like a paintin with no color it's-why I attach the words
My mind the brush, my life the canvas, the world, the easel
Combines a perfect picture for people
My words is colorful like autumn
The way they fall on the track like leaves when I record em'
There's nothin like it when I write
And I don't print, I invent it and predict it like a psychic
Pull down the shades on the windows of your soul
And gaze into your mind and watch the wisdom unfold
I was taught when your vision's impaired
The wisdom is there
A message from Big Homey couldn't-have sent it no clear
I know the flow is like hypnotic
And tightest tip when I drop it with no particular topic
Type shit that can't be bitten so stop it
Type shit that can't be re-written on copy
By kinko, kodak, fuji films
Kin-folk know that groovy hymns
Spit by him'll put the gospel to you
Catch some little higher learning from a sermon once I drop it to you
Hypnotic...hypnotic...
My flow is like hypnotic...
The flow is like hypnotic...
My flow is like hypnotic...
(Memphis Bleek)
So roll a ""L"" and light a incent
It's like magic when I event
This shit that I present
It's not a secret when I speak it
I know that hatin' isn't physical but dawg I could peep it
It's like a preacher preachin' his scripts or psychic readin' a palm
Lines give me what I write in-this song
The book is now open so let the story be told
I enter through your mind and exit the back of your soul
That could push you to some insight
A shine like a headlight
Pickeny diamond watch me get right
I'm that nice
Words is a cure that help me heal up a heart
Words can become that evil game that help me get what I want..uh
You start where you end, you end where you start
I am the light of the situation I overshine dark
Give you the pen, the book, the word, the truth, the sight, the mind
I put it down, you call it a rhyme, I call it a sign
I predict the unpredictable
Heaven is invisible, but hell isn't physical
Let me stop with the spiritual.. whoa
Let me spit at you, show you how to move with no vehicle
Come through your speakers
Into/enter your ear, end up in paragraphs
Tellin' your man of what you hear
'cause, spit it I often roll it tighter than chronic
Styles versatile meanwhile it's hypnotic
Hypnotic...hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
(Jay-Z)
Pass the dutchie if you was ill
Take one to the grizzill
Tell me what you fizzill
It's like a complicated puzzle unravelin', mind travelin', with no particular flight patterin
Speak the language of the lizand
Desert feeds worm, worm feeds falcon, falcon feeds man ..uh
Only the strong survive, so if you along for the ride strap your boots and leave your thongs inside..uh
We experience turbulence in urban environments daily, rarely it's aqcuired
We riot like Israelis
Why am I here that question overwhelms me
I am a gangsta, Dr. Melfi couldn't help me
I am a thinker, my mind fixes all that L's/ills me the perfect elixir
I trust mines will never fail me
I let my speech unfold, I reach deep inside the seed of my soul and I got it
Hypnotic...hypnotic....
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style.. hypnotic..

Four page letters in addition to
Have you ever loved somebody used to get the party poppin
We used to party alot, we used to be in the Hampton's partied alot
We was The Breakfast Club you was a part of the ROC
We used to make up special names for the food we ate
Remember cerial pie one of your favorite plates (I miss you)
Well Dame told me tell you he's doin well
Due to the circumstances, it could've been Bellevue
But I ain't got to tell you, you lookin over us

Cause of your memory I won't bring in the pistols
But he got issues enough of that lame
I never seen pain like your parents pain

All across the world, blocks is miserable
Y'all left a void it's alot of little yous
But they not original and they not identical
They just studied your flows and they watched your interviews
That's when hip hop if it's not ten of you
Then it gotta be more, y'all left your paws
Footprints on the game hood ain't been the same
Feeling ain't been in music hooks ain't been the same
But I'm doing what I can man and try to follow y'all memory lane man
Big you be ashamed to see New York gangbang
Pac you feel the same thing they use your name in vein

And it proves how much, niggas really miss you

Thank you, thank you, thank you

Can I get an encore, do you want more
Cooking raw with the Brooklyn boy

Now what the hell are you waiting for?

After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, make some noise

Get em Jay

Who you know fresher than Hov? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah hearing me rap is like hearing G. Rap in his prime
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the Blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand opening, grand closing
God damn your man Hov cracked the can open again
Who you goin' find doper than him with no pen
Just draw off inspiration
Soon you goin' see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for these generations

Can I get an encore, do you want more
Cooking raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now what the hell are you waiting for?

After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, make some noise

What the hell are you waiting for?

Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan, wearing the 4-5
It ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowing you to smithereens
Cocksucker take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts
So motherfucker if you want this encore
I need you to scream, till your lungs get sore

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless
Lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure
Of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow
Just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow
Just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you

I've become so numb
Can I get an encore, do you want more? (More, more, more)

Even though what we do is wrong...
We still hustle 'til the sun come up
Crack a 40 when the sun go down
It's a cold winter

Y'all niggaz better bundle up
And I bet it be a hotter summer, grab a onion
Yes the ROC gets down, you hot now, listen up
Don't you know cops' whole purpose is to lock us down?

And throw away the key
But without this drug shit your kids ain't got no way to eat, huh?
We still try to keep Mom...smilin'...
'Cause when the teeth stop showin' and the stomach start growlin'

If you from the hood I know you feel me ([Jay-Z:] Keep goin'...)
If a sneak start leanin' and the heat stop workin'
Then my heat start workin' I'm-a rob me a person

Catch a nigga sleepin' while he out in the open...and I'm-a get him ([Jay-Z:] Keep flowin'...)
We gotta raise our kids while we livin'
Make a million off-a record bail my niggaz outta prison
Fuck a Bentley or a Lexus just my boys in the squadder

Nigga talk reckless then I hit 'em with the Smif 'n...
But I'm never snitchin' I'm a rider
If my kids hungry snatch the dishes out ya kitchen
I'll be wylin' til they pick me outta line-up...

We keep the nines tucked, chopped dimes up, rap about it
Wyle out, fuck niggaz up, laugh about it
I'm not tryin' to visit the morgue but Freeway move out 'til I sit with the Lord
'Til I...get my shit together, clean up my sins

And I ain't talkin' bout chicken and gravy mang!

I'm talkin' bout bricks 'o ye-yo, halves and quarters

Bang like T-Mac, ski mask air it out

Wipe tears from my mother, pull out beers for her brothers...
That's above us, make beds for the babies
Tuck kids under covers, buy cribs for their mothers

Shit I'll probably be wylin' with their fathers
Tell Ms. Robert, tell Enijah that I'm ridin' for her father
That's like my brother, like same mother different father
Any problems dog know I got 'em

And still we grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom sold crack in the alleyways
Still gave back Marcy a Dollar Day

Did you ever think that you would be the nigga on the block
Didn't have to break a steerin' column, didn't have to cook a rock
A damn goodie two-shoes, that what they call ya
Never judge a person or a book by it's covers
Just because my tone is darker than yours, a little tanner
You never took the time out, examine yourself Boi
Are you black, white, asian?
Indonesian, or Borean-that's black and Korean
We on the same team if we breathin'
I jumped off the subject to see if you was seein'
That we drop a little science off in every verse
They put that P.A. sticker on it cause they scared we gon' curse
But the knowledge is the power, the cowards get devoured
Any hour, any cipher, any way to any height
Because I might just snap on a Fuck-ass nigga
Might clap a cap at a sucker-ass nigga
In the meantime, Daddy Fat sacks gon' chill out
He might just, pull out his pistol
And let that thing whistle at your windshield or your residence
Superman to Clark Kent, you better be way harded
Than the park bench to start this
Marcus, Jason, my little brother James
All my brothers from my momma but Andre is just the same
Ain't no uno, we a duo; deuce dos to a pair
A player stiffen the competition
Pressed like Levi's toughskins, on minus one
Negative one minus negative one is nothin'
Bustin' d-boy raps and player poems
The ""Kast shit ain't plastic, we smash it and move the crowd
And rock the crowd original material while you bore 'em
Your life show consists of eveybody's shit but you're-uns
Do you own shit! In your life show (bitin ass nigga)

Penelope Ann Cruz couldn't snooze
With her Eye's Wide Shut, before I ashed to hit her gut
If you brunette, Legally Blonde, I might respond
Take you to Swan Lake, and beyond
Antwan raps on, raps on, clap off clop on
I switch the flow so quick you cannot fa-thom
I take a submarine two thousand leagues below the sea
And try to grab one line or sentence
Rhyme repentance, find the illest lyricist
And give him a clean bill of health
Wealth might make you look good but you sound like shit
And your team looking shitty to death

My nigga Big Boi said ""Watch 'em as they gawk and they gander""
You can follow or lead like Commander Picard
You can have The Whole World
Or be satisfied with the boulevard, over stand
This young player's line
I foregoed the crime and I focused on rhyme
Focused on every word, and line
Like a young Cassius Clay in his prime
I was born to talk shit and prove mine, and I'm
The epitome of raw rhyme
Got signed, got serious about the craft
Of raw rhyme and I got mine, Aquemini's
Murderous monster move minds
Did it so hard that it oughta be a crime
When you see I'm comin' holla one-time, holla one-time
When you see I'm comin' holla one-time (one-time)

Don't, you, like, to groove
In your hooptie on your old, flip, flop, sweatshoes
To run yo' tennis shoes
Don't, it, matter to you
That Outkast we got that slump for y'all
Keep that funk for y'all

When I'm in the mood I rock the S Dot tennis shoes
As a interlude, I got the Gucci flip-flops
And I, fix it up like gin and juice when I'm them interviews
Dudes want to know what he copped
And where you got that, and how could they buy that
Where the million dollar watch at, stop that!
Why that, why this, niggas want to hijack the flyness
I'm on a whole 'nother plane
A whole different lane, a whole 'nother game that I'm playin'
Understand what I'm sayin'
Hov' and Outkast, what you think about that?
Really don't matter though what you niggas chatter though
Anybody get out of line then you trust
That the mac'll go are-are-are-are-rap, got you killed for that alone
Back on the shit back on the strip
Another hit I'm not goin' miss

Don't, you, like, to groove
In your hooptie on your old, flip, flop, sweatshoes
To run yo' tennis shoes
Don't, it, matter to you

Jay-Z,"The allure of breaking the law
Was always too much for me to ever ignore
I've got a thing for the big-body Benzes, it dulls my senses
In love with a V-Dub engine
Man, I'm high off life, fuck it, I'm wasted
Bathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet wrist
My women friends get tennis bracelets
Trips to Venice, get their Winters replaced with
The sun, it ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it
I put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without saying a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy
My brother hustled so naturally
Up next was me but what perplexes me
Shit, I know how this movie ends! yet still I play
The starring role in ""Hovito's Way""

It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most, oh no
But every time I felt that was that, it called me right back
It called me right back, man it called me right back, oh no

I'm like a Russian mobster, drinking distilled vodka
Until I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real
Peel the top up like a toupée
Mix the water with the soda
Turn the pot up, make a soufflé
All of y'all can get it like group-page on your 2-way
I'm living proof that crime do pay
Say ""hooray"" to the bad guy, and all the broads
Putting cars in their name, for the stars of the game
Putting 'caine in their bras and their tomorrows on the train:
All in the Name of Love
Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
Over the house to take back everything that they claimed
Or even the worse pain is the distress
Learning you're the mistress only after that love gets slain
And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
Now it gets tough to ever love again
But the allure of the game, keeps calling your name
To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain
To all the Christies in different cities and Tiffany Lanes:
We all hustlers in love with the same thing

It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most, oh no
But every time I felt that was that, it called me right back
It called me right back, man it called me right back, oh no

I never felt more alive than riding shotgun
In Klein's green 5, until the cops pulled guns
And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need
What the game did to my pulse with no results
And you can treat your nose and still won't come close
The game is a lightbulb with eleventy-million volts
And I'm just a moth addicted to the floss
The doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
By any means necessary, whatever the cost
Even if it means lives is lost
And I can't explain why I just love to get high
Drink, ""life!"" smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice
I'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times
I may not even be alive
I mean even James Dean couldn't escape the allure
Dying young, leaving a good-lookin corpse, of course

I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most, oh no
But every time I felt that was that, it called me right back
It called me right back, man it called me right back, oh no",Allure,2003
Jay-Z,"Shawn Carter was born December 4th
Weighing in at 10 pounds 8 ounces
He was the last of my four children
The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him
And that's how I knew that he was a special child

They say ""they never really miss you til you dead or you gone""
So on that note I'm leaving after this song
So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay, so long
At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adaness Revees
Who made love under the Sycamore tree
Which makes me
A more sicker emcee than my momma would claim
At ten pounds when I was born I didn't give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare
I made it from birth and I got here
She knows my purpose wasn't purpose
I ain't perfect I care
But I feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matching my gear
Now I'm just scratching the surface cause what's buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school got good grades could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
Hold on

Shawn was a very shy child growing up
He was into sports
And a funny story is
At four he taught his self how to ride a bike
A two wheeler at that
Isn't that special?
But, I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up

Now all the teachers couldn't reach me
And my momma couldn't beat me
Hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seeing me, so
With that disdain in my membrane
Got on my pimp game
Fuck the world my defense came
Then Dahaven introduced me to the game
Spanish Jose introduced me to cane
I'm a hustler now
My gear is in and I'm in the in crowd
And all the wavy light skinned girls is loving me now
My self esteem went through the roof man I got my swag
Got a vocal from this girl when her man got bagged
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had
Supposedly knowing nobody paid Jaz wack ass
I'm getting ahead of myself, by the way, I could rap
That came second to me moving this crack
Gimme a second I swear
I will say about my rap career
Til '96 came niggas I'm here
Good-bye

Shawn use to be in the kitchen
Beating on the table and rapping
And um, until the wee hours of the morning
And then I bought him a boom box
And his sisters and brothers said that he would drive them nuts
But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble

Good-bye to the game all the spoils, the adrenaline rush
Your blood boils you in a spot knowing cops could rush
And you in a drop your so easy to touch
No two days are alike
Except the first and fifteenth pretty much
And ""trust"" is a word you seldom hear from us
Hustlers we don't sleep we rest one eye up
And a drought can define a man, when the well dries up
You learn to work the water without working, of thirst you'll die yup
And niggas get tied up for product
And little brothers ring fingers get cut up
To show mothers they really got 'em
And this was the stress I live with til I decided
To try this rap shit for a living
I pray I'm forgiven
For every bad decision I made
Every sister I played
Cause I'm still paranoid to this day
And it's nobody fault I made the decisions I made
This is the life I chose or rather the life that chose me

If you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black

If you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black

If you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black

If you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black",December 4th,2003
Jay-Z,"The other night
While I was uh researchin' what were goin' to be discussin' today
I came across a passage in a book that um
I think it uh really simplifies
What the human administrative is talkin' about
And I learned that all things must come to an end
It is an inevitable part of the cycle of resistance
All things must conclude

Take the analogy of a tree that grows in Brooklyn
Among the steel and the concrete
With all its glorious branches and leaves
One day it too will pass on its legacy
Through the seeds it dropped to the ground
And as the wind carries these seeds throughout wherever they might move
A new life will begin for each one of them
As they stand as a monument to the one that came before
That came before that came before
That came before that came before",Interlude,2003
Jay-Z,"Uh, this feel right right here, Quik
It's like it's supposed to happen this one right here

It goes one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, Roc
Five six seven o'clock, eight o'clock, Roc
Eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, the party bout to pop
Then, Roc-A-Fella y'all, it's your boy S. Dot
And I ain't never been to jail, I ain't never pay a nigga
To do no dirt for me I was scared to do myself
I will never tell, even if it means sittin in a cell
I ain't never ran, never will
I ain't never been smacked, a nigga better keep his hands
To himself or get clapped for what's under that man's belt
I never asked for nothin I don't demand of myself
Honesty, loyalty, friends and then wealth
Death before dishonor and I tell you what else
I tighten my belt 'fore I beg for help
Foolish pride is what held me together through the years
I wasn't felt which is why I ain't never played myself
I just play the hand I'm dealt, I can't say I've never knelt
Before God and asked for better cards at times to no avail
But I never sat back feelin sorry for myself
If you don't give me heaven I'll raise hell
'Til it's heaven

Justify my thug, my thug, for you (hoping, praying)

Now if you shoot my dog, I'mma kill yo' cat
Just the unwritten laws in rap, know dat
For every action there's a reaction, don't have me relapsin'
Relaxin's what I'm about, but about mine
Don't be actin like you can't see street action
Take me back to Reasonable Doubt time
You see my mind's on the finish line, facin the wreck
I put my muh'fuckin faith in the tec, tell Satan not yet
You understand I am chasin my breath
I am narrowly escapin' my death, oh yes
I am the Michael Schumacher of the Roc roster
Travellin Mach 5, barrel in my apparel can stop God
God forgive me but I can't let them deliver me to you
Until, I won this race, then eventually
My engine gon' burn out, I get whatever is meant for me
However it turns out fine, red line!

Justify my thug, my thug, for you (hoping, praying)

They say an eye for an eye, we both lose our sight
And two wrongs don't make a right
But when you been wronged and you know all along that it's just one life
At what point does one fight? (Good question, right?)
'Fore you knock the war, try to put your dogs in his
Ten-and-a-halfs, for a minute-and-a-half
Bet that stops all the grinnin and the laughs
When you play the game of life and the win ain't in the bag
When your options is none and the pen is all you have
Or the block, niggas standin tight as lemons on the ave
Tryin to cop a shop call theyself cleansin in the cash
But can't put they name on paper cause, then you on blast
Mr. President, there's drugs in our residence
Tell me what you want me to do, come break bread with us
Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up
Every other corner there's a liquor store, fuck is up?

Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity, this moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths through my ""Hard Knock Life"" time my gift and a curse
I gave you volume after volume of my work so you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt (Y'all can't fill my shoes)
From my Blueprint beginnings 'til that Black Album ending
Listen close you hear what I'm about, nigga feel my truths

When pop died, didn't cry, didn't know him that well
Between him doing heroin and me doing crack sales
With that in the egg shell standing at the tabernacle
Rather the church pretending to be hurt
Wouldn't work so a smirk was all on my face
Like damn that mans face was just like my face
So pop I forgive you for all the shit that I live through
It wasn't all your fault homie you got caught
And to the same game I fault that Uncle Ray lost
My big brothers and so many others I saw
I'm just glad we got to see each other
Talk and re-meet each other save a place in Heaven
Til the next time we meet forever

The music business hate me 'cause the industry ain't make me
Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be making
I dumb down for my audience and double my dollars
They criticize me for it yet they all yell ""Holla""
If skills sold truth be told
I'd probably be lyrically Talib Kweli
Truthfully I want to rhyme like Common Sense (But I did five Mil)
I ain't been rhyming like Common since
When your sense got that much in common
And you been hustling since, your inception, fuck perception
Go with what makes sense
Since I know what I'm up against
We as rappers must decide what's most important
And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them
So I got rich and gave back to me that's the win, win
The next time you see the homie and his rims spin
Just know my mind is working just like them (The rims that is)

Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity, this moment of honesty

My homie Sigel's on a tier where no tears should fall
'Cause he was on the block where no squares get off
See in my inner circle all we do is ball
'Til we all got triangles on our wall
He ain't just rapping for the platinum, y'all record
I recall, 'cause I really been there before
Four scores and seven years ago prepared to flow prepare for war
I shall fear no man you don't hear me though
These words ain't just paired to go in one ear out the other ear, no
Yo, my balls and my word is all's I have
What you gonna do to me? Nigga scars'll scab
What you gonna box me homie? I can dodge and jab
Three shots couldn't touch me thank God for that
I'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back
And the whole BK nigga holla back

Had to pull the opposite out this bitch
Had to get my ride on
Eyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to
Had to had to get these chips
Had to make moves like Olajuwon
Started out selling dimes and nicks
Graduated to a brick
No exaggeration, my infatuation with the strip
Legendary like a schoolboy
Crushin' merely nearly every every chick
Heavy shit, that's how schoolboy got whipped
And got left on some, Just Me, Myself and I
On some Trugoy shit
Had to go to a place of
To a place of no return
Had to play with fire and get burned
Only way the boy ever gon' learn
Had to lay way in the cut, til I finally got my turn

It's my life
It's my pain and my struggle
The song that I sing to you it's my everything
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst is the same as when I came
It's my joy and my tears and the laughter it brings to me
It's my everything

Like I never rode in a limo
Like I just dropped flows to a demo
Like it's ninety-two again and
And I got O's in the rental
Back in the stu' again
No prob' living was a whole lot simpler
When you think back, you thought that
You would never make it this far, then you
Take advantage of the luck you handed
Or the talent, you been given
Ain't no, half stepping, ain't no, no slipping
Ain't no different from a block that's hitting
Gotta get it while the getting's good
Gotta strike while the iron's hot, before you stop
Then you gotta bid it, good riddance
Goodbye, this is my second major breakup
My first was, with a pager
With a hooptie, a cookpot, and the 'caine
This one's with the stu, with the stage, with the fortune
Maybe not the fortune, but certainly the fame

""Now before I finish, let me just say
I did not come here to show out, did not come here to impress you
Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm gone!

When it hits the fan brother, whether it's next year, ten years,
Twenty years from now, you're gonna be able to say
That these brothers lied to you Jack!""

Ting ain't lie
I done came through the block in everything that's fly
I'm like, Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga I get mine, by any means on whenever there's a drought
Get your umbrellas out because, that's when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game
I just rolled the dice, trying to get some change
And I do it twice, ain't no sense in me
Lying as if, I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains
Hope you don't think users are the only abusers
Niggas getting high within the game
If you do then, how would you explain?
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins
I got a hustler spirit, nigga period
Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag yo, I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go, you are what you are player
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone
Either love me, or leave me alone

The more you goin' need memorial services

Devil's pie, save some dessert for us

Man, I gotta get my soul right,
I gotta get these devils out my life,
These cowards gonna make a nigga right,
They won't be happy 'til somebody die,
Oh man, I gotta get my soul right,
'Fore I'm locked up for my whole life,
Every time it seems it's alright
Somebody want they soul to rise
I chase you off of this earth

I got dreams, of holdin' a nine milla, to Bob's killer
Askin him why as my eyes fill up
These days I can't wake up with a dry pillow
Gone but not forgotten, homes I still feel you
So, curse the day that birthed the bastard
Who caused your church mass, reverts to crash
The first to blast then reverse the curse
The first to date and there you are, Bobalob
Lord forgive him, we all have sinned
But Bob's a good dude, please let him in
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge
Please blame it on the son of the mornin', thanks again",Lucifer,2003

Use to play the hall up fifth floor me and my boys we
All poor getting high I
seen the worst of the worst I deserve every blessing

I received I'm from the dirt
I planted my seed on unfertile land Myrtle Park

Still I grew some how I knew the sun will shine through

And touch my soul take hold of my hand
Look man a tree grows in Brooklyn

To old Nell, Sigel street I ain't forget you

Twenty n****s on the block trying to chase that buck
Nosey neighbors and haters keep their face on stuck
Cops roll up on the pavement break the dice games up
Behind smoke kids can't chase the ice cream truck

Girls fighting over Rollie young boys hype things up
N****s fighting over Cold young boys light things up
All the petty a** wars f*** the night scene up
Remember Lil' Eddie man how he light mean up

Then they wonder why we light green up
Back to back steamers trying to relax but I can't
I lean up ain't the L or the refer that steam up
It's my head stress to the point I get a fever

Thinking bout the block and all the mothers and kids
That can't leave and how the Chinks gotta feed'em
For the rest of their life f***ing wings fried
Vegetable rice(gotta be kidding)

No breakfast Cap'n Crunch at night
Our kids eating lunch at night
In their beds all bunched in tight
No less than three or four(you know how it go)

Two by the foot two by the headboard
Man I'm getting scared for them (Yeah I know)
that's how I feel for them
And we gotta grip the shorties on the block

All they do is smoke weed and drink forties
Cop their quarties
Enough to get the latest ROC, newest glock, and old Jordies

Some how some way
We gonna make it up out the hood someday
Some how some way
We gonna make it up out this life
Some how some way
We gonna make it up out the hood one day
Some way we gonna make it up out this life

Right here another lil' story bout this click I claimed
Another chapter based on how I get that game
Hanging round my neighborhood and bang my street
Sit and watch the pa**er-bys play my sweep

South-side sunny side
Blocks I run South Vegas, South Paul
N**** all got guns
Over here we got this poor (?) get that there

We know tomorrow ain't promise so we get that there
F*** sitting in the living room guarding the steps
Working inside a slump house starving to death
Serving these n**** flippers, quarter-ounces and

Zippers agents snapping your picture neighbors
Plotting to get ya
Situations is critic I was out here to get it
Living it like a savage cause n**** I gotta have it

And holding back all the mothers for a minute
Pumping hard dog
Erase enough to walk it down and f*** it all dog
Love being willied and your creek gonna rise

I'm be a n**** and these streets gonna rise

Eat for a living nigga (watcher)
That's how I live for a living nigga (watcher)
Okay, let's do this (the watcher)

Things just ain't the same for gangsters
But I'm a little too famous to shoot these pranksters
All of these rap singers claiming they bangers
Doing all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
Disrespecting the game, no home training or manners
I was doing this shit when you was shitting Pampers
I was moving them grams 'fore you, knew what a hand that hand was
Ducking the vans, radars, the scanners
'Fore you knew what hard white to tame was
I was hitting the turnpike, aight with the bammers
I was nice with my hands, cuss aight with them hammers
I was pricking my finger 'fore you knew what a Fam was
I had it laid out before you knew what a plan was
Three hundred mill' later, now you understand us
Y'all ain't see us coming through Vegas
You ever seen so much cham' bust in one night
Grand fucked up one fight
I was on the Peter Pan bus
You was Peter Pan up in your room, y'all fucking with whom?
Allowed me to be taught
You cowards is just now learning the shit that we talk
You niggas ain't know about a Robb Report
Bout a high speed Porsche, i.e.
You niggas ain't know how to floss 'til I came through the door
like ""Eric B. for Pres,"" respect me in this bitch!
You can't disrespect us cause you got a little check cut
You was sucking for so long, fucking your little neck up
Now you too big for your britches, you got a few little bitches
You think you Hugh Hefner, you just ridiculous
I blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game
It's only right I got the right to be king
Niggaz that got life really like what I sing
Cause they know is he really like, niggas feel my pain
Know the shit I DON'T write be the illest shit that's ever been recited
in the game word to the hyphen in my name!
J, A, Y, DASH, Hoffa
The past present nigga the future, proper
The holy trinity of hip-hop is us
We give, Dre his props BUT that's where it stops
It's the Roc

[Chorus]
I know, you got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
(Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as before)
(People I used to know, just don't know me no mo')
(But everywhere that I go, I got people I know)
(Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)

I'm still on top of the game
Still dropping flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top had the Roc for the fame
over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came
You seen it all, how I got, how I gained
The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
the streets, they made a special spot for my name
Dre, haters wanna stop to my reign
But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain
All the way back from the rise of my name
See the world clear through the eyes of the mane
See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave
When the beat bangs it'll drive them insane
The eyes that I played
The best to emerge in the game is The Watcher

[Chorus]

I'm ""Rated R,"" my brain contains graphics things
It turn traumatic teens into addicts, and fiends
It's like, watching a movie through a panoramic screen
Which means, I can see the whole planet in the scene
Cash is the topic, the object, a fatter pocket
Some take the crack and chop it, but those that haven't got it
take away the added profit, it's catastrophic
I take the gat and cock it, and I'll sit back and watch it
These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully
The world is mine and can't nobody keep it from me
Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny
In the place where the number one cause of death is money
You can try coping
I've seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
I'm still alive and scoping
Be another hundred years 'til my skies close in
And I'ma die with my eyes open, the watcher [echoes]

Stop falling asleep that's old man shit

No more minute man in it

You got starch in your flow
I flow too many ways, got a arch in my flow
All sorts of flow, Rembrandt, Rilkey
I am art with the flow
Even if I'm filthy, you gotta pardon the flow
Niggas taking it lightly, had to darken the flow
Way I put it together, tear 'em apart with the flow
I'm too smart with the flow, you just started the flow
Stop it youngin', you 106th & Park with the flow
I am pro, as you see I'm off the charts with the flow
Actually I'm number one on the charts with the flow
In some places they say this, I am God with the flow
Like my office, but they're biased, too involved with the flow
(Oh no) I am the youth spirit, I am y'all with the flow
Troubled man, dare I say, I am Mar with the flow

To put out The Reason by the Mac, Philadelphia Freeway
And I'm back, without leavin' I'm here, but you can't see him
I gave you the Blueprint but you can't be him
So no matter what you been told or the records you sold
Deep inside you know that it's only one Hove

If my life is a movie then Sigel be the sequel
We bring it to your door with Bleek peekin' through your peek hole
And don't get scared nigga, alert ya people

But you know I want ya (you should stop frontin babe)

Trying to be the best girlfriend you could be
But still you sneak and look at me, and girl I love it
Then you give your other girl a shove
Tell her you gon' call and ask how it was
And she's gon love it (whoa-oh whoa, yeah yeah)

Cutie, smelling like Tiaka, half-Phillipine thing
For now, let's call her Suki, got me this booty banging
Properly, in Versace pants, cocky bow-legged stance
A thing of beauty, watch me, body crazy
Tits Firm like Nature, Foxy, Nas and AZ
Truly reason to bug the toolie and keep laced in jewelry watch me
Girlie tried to lure me and lock me you gotta get up early
Cause who's getting played is not me
""Surely you jest,"" she said, ""if you thought I was purely
Out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me""
I said maturely, ""You right
But better safe than sorry, but for the lovebirds
Can move to the suburbs, I need to double check your story
To make sure that you one of a kind
And you deserve to be my Sunshine""

Just to say they crept with mine, slept with mine, she said

I ain't deaf nor blind, niggas stressing
Hatin cause they less than mine, they wanna sex me
We chose each other, you acting like you chose me
They oppose you then, they oppose me
We could creep at a low speed, the gat in the hosiery
Double cross you they got to triple cross me

 If I ever go broke, would you hit the block for me?) Fo' sho'

Catch a case you catch it with me? (fo' sho')
Pawn your jewelery to come get me? (You better know)
Catch me with a chick, forgive me? (now that, I don't know)
They spread rumors, will you defend me, tooth and nail? (Uh-huh)
They try to frame me, will you be there, till the truth prevail? (uhh)
(But would you be the same dude, when you blow the roof off sales
 that you was, throwing rocks, at the roof at 12, nigga?)
This is the truth I shell, till the loot gets frail
I put this on my nephews, from the smallest to the pale
Me and you balling, from the heavens, or the hell
Won't let you hit the ground if I'm falling myself
Now picture me leaving you in this cold world, rolling for delf
It's me and you in this old girl, we taking the belt
From the lows, to the highs, to the foes we shine

Brooklyn stand up

There's never been a nigga this good for this long
This hood
Or this pop is hot
Or this strong
With so many different flows
This ones for this song
The next one I'll switch up
This one will get bit up
These fucks
To lazy to make up shit
They crazy
They don't paint pictures
They just trace me
You know what
Soon they forget who they plucked
They whole style from
And try to reverse the outcome
I'm like, cluck
I'm not a biter
I'm a writer
For myself and others
I say a big verse I'm only biggin' up my brother
Biggin' up my borough
I'm big enough to do it
I'm that thorough
Plus I know my own flow is foolish
So the rings and things you sing about
Bring em out
It's hard to yell when the bar-rel's in your mouth
I'm in, new sneakers
Deuce seaters
A few divas
What more can I tell you
Let me spell it for you
W-I-Double L-I-E
Nobody truer than H-O-V
And I'm back for more

Prime Minister back to finish my business up

What more can I say?
What more can I do?
I give this all to you
I know this much is true

(See what I see)
What more can I say to you
You heard it all

You already know what I'm about
Flying birds down south
Moving wet off the step
Purple Rain in the drought
Stunting on hoes
Brushing off my shirt
But ain't nothing on my clothes
Except my chain
My name
Young H-O
Pitch the yea faithful
Even if they patrol I make payroll
Benz paid for
Friends they roll
Private jets down to Turks and Caheos
Chrys case loads
I don't give a shit
Nigga one life to live I can't let a day go
Bye
Without me being fly
Fresh to death
Head to toe until the day I rest
And I don't wear jerseys I'm thirty plus
Give me a crisp pair of jeans nigga button ups
S dots on my feet
Make a cipher complete
What more can I say Guru play the beat

We gonna let this ride into the hook
I'ma snap my fingers on this one
What more can I say to you?
Get my grown man on
Let's go!
(What more can I say?)

Now you know ass is willie
When they got you in a mag
For like half a billi
And your ass ain't Lilly
White
That mean that shit you write must be illy
Either that or your flow is silly
It's both
I don't mean to boast
But damn if I don't brag
Them crackers gonna act like I ain't on they ads
The Martha Stewart
That's far from Jewish
Far from a Harvard student
Just had the balls to do it
And no I'm not through with it
In fact I'm just previewing it
This ain't the show I'm just EQ'in it
One, two and I won't stop abusing it
To groupie girls stop false accusing it
Back to the music
The Maybach roof is translucent
Niggas got a problem Houston
What up be
They can't shut up me
Shut down I
Not even P.E.
I'ma ride
God forgive me for my brash delivery
But I remember vividly
What these streets did to me
So picture me
Letting these clowns nit pick at me
Paint me like a pickiny
I will literally
Kiss Tee-Tee in the forehead
Tell her please forgive me
Then squeeze until your forehead
I'm not the one to score points off
In fact
I got a joint to knock your points off
Young
Hova the God nigga blast for me
I'm at the Trump International
Ask for me
I ain't never scared
I'm everywhere
You ain't never there
Nigga why would I ever care
Pound for pound I'm the best to ever come around here
Excluding nobody
Look what I embody
The soul of a hustler I really ran the street
I CEO's mine
That marketing plan was me
And no I ain't get shot up a whole bunch of times
Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines
And I ain't animated, like say a, Busta Rhymes
But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines
Add that to the fact I went plat a bunch of times
Times that by my influence
On pop culture
I supposed to be number one on everybody's list
We'll see what happens when I no longer exist
Fuck this

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right

Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
And watches everything

So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right beneath my skin

Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can, but

Said the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin they like the way I be leanin
All the rappers be hatin, off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pops

Remember condescending took for who I ought to be
Remember listenin' to all of that and this again

Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away and (It's so unreal)
I didn't look out below
I watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, and didn't even know
I wasted it all just to (Watch you go)

On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand opening, grand closing
God damn your man Hov cracked the can open again

If I owe you I'm blowing you to smithereens

I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts

Lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure
Of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow
Just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow
Just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you

I've become so numb
Can I get an encore, do you want more? (More, more, more)

I've become so numb

Fagots running to the Po-Po's, smoke em like cocoa 
**** rap, coke by the boatload 
**** dat, on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed 
Left holes through some guy clothes 
Stop your bullshitting, glock with the full clip 
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit 
One shot could make a ***** do a full flip 
See the ***** laying shocked when the bullet hit 
And hey ma, how you, know niggas want to buy you 
But see me I want to ""**** for Free"" like Akinyele 
Take this ride 'til you feel it inside ya belly 
If it's tight get the K-why Jelly 
All night get you wide up inside the telly 
Side to side, til you say Jay-Z you're too much for me

I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard 
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact 
That everybody can see these scars 
(I am)
What I want you to want, what I want you to feel 
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you 
To just believe this is real 
(So I)
Let go watching you turn your back like you always do 
Face away and pretend that I'm not 
That's all I give cause you're all that I've got 

Got a condo with nuttin' but condoms in it 
The same place where the rhymes is invented 
So all I do is rap and ***, imagine how I stroke 
See how I was flowing on my last cassette? 
Rapid-fire like I'm blasting a Tec, never jam though 
Never get high, never run out of ammo 
Niggas hating n **** cause I slayed your ***** 
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick 
And now you're, acting raw but you never had war 
Don't know how to carry your hoe, want to marry your hoe 
Now she's mad at me, cause Your Majesty, just happened to be 
A pimp with a tragedy 
She wanted, us to end, cause I fucked her friend 
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again 
I seen her tears as she busted in, I said, ""****.. 
There's a draft, shut the door ***** and come on in!"" 

I am, a little bit insecure, a little un-confident 
But you don't understand I do what I can 
Sometimes I don't make sense 
I am, what you never want to say, but I've never had a doubt 
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out 
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do 
You face away and pretend that I'm not 
But I'll be here cause you're all that I've got 

I can't feel the way I did before 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
Time won't heal this damage anymore 
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored

Now hear me out now 
You're gonna listen to me like it or not 
Right now, hear me out now 
You're gonna listen to me like it or not 
Right now 

I can't feel the way I did before 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored

Bounce on the Devil, put the pedal to the floor (c'mon!)
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I, pull over to the side of the road

Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo'?

Are you carryin' a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are)
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my papers legit
(Well do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?)
Well my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that

You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or somethin'?)

Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'mma get to clappin' and
He and his boys gon' be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' them
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mill' for bail cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them

Cooking raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

Who you know fresher than Hov'?  Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah hearing me rap is like hearing G. Rap in his prime
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young, what the fuck you expect?  Yep, yep
Grand opening, grand closing
God your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you goin' find doper than him with no pen
Just draw off inspiration
Soon you goin' see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for these generations

Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cooking raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan, wearing the 4-5
It ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowing you to smithereens
Cocksucker take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts
So motherfucker if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore

It's star time
This man is made!  He's killing all y'all jive turkeys
Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?
Well if y'all want more of the Jigga man
Then I need y'all to help me, bring him back to stage
Say Hova, c'mon say it!
HO-VA!  HO-VA!  Are y'all out there? (HO-VA! HO-VA!)
Are y'all out there?  C'mon, louder!
Yeah, now see that's what I'm talking bout
They love you Jigga, they love you Jigga!

I like the way this one feel
It's so motherfucking soulful man!
Yeah okay

So this here is the victory lap
Then I'm leaving, that's how you get me back
After a year of them sixteen's, it's one point two
And that's two point four, and I'm only doing two
You wanted to gain attention new dudes
I can get you BET and TRL too
You wanna be in the public, send your budget
Well fuck it, I ain't budging!
Young did it to death, you gotta love it
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
Now look at me, all star-studded
Golfer above par like I putted
All cause the shit I uttered, was utterly ridiculous
How sick is this?
You want to bang, send Kanye change, send Just some dust
Send Hip a grip, then you got' spit

I see you vision mama, I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Now I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot; sleepin on futons and cots
to King Size, dream machines, the green fives
I've seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills

I'm tight grill with the phony, rappers y'all might feel we homies

Gotta a lot of beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustling's still inside of me, and as far as progress
you'd be hard-pressed, to find another rapper hot as me

We can get some government paper
You know food stamps, can we really do that?
Hell yeah, right there for the takin'
Fuck welfare, we say reparations

Get up early get in the line and just wait
Everybody on break that's part of the game
And when they call your name
Ms. Case Worker let my state my claim

I'm homeless, jobless, times is hard, I'm 'bout hopeless
But I gotta eat regardless
No family to run to I'm 22
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do

My sad story made her feel close to me
I made her feel like it was an emergency
When I came to the crib niggaz couldn't believe
I came back with a big bag of groceries, hell yeah

Every job I ever had I had to get on the first day
I find out how to pimp on the system
Two steps ahead of the manager
Gettin' over on the regular tax free money out of the register

And when I'm workin' late nights
Stockin' boxes I'm creepin' they merchandise
And don't put me on dishes I'm droppin' them bitches
And takin' all day long to mop the kitchen shit

We ain't gettin' paid commission, minimum wage
Modern day slave conditions
Got me flippin' burgers with no power
Can't even buy one off what I make in an hour

I'm not the one to kiss ass for the top position
I take mine off the top like a politician
Where I'm from doin' dirt is a part of living
I got mouths to feed, dawg, I gots to get it

Hell yeah, you down to roll my nigga?
Hell yeah, you ready to get your hands dirty my nigga?
Hell yeah, your woman need money and things my nigga?
Hell yeah, well let's ride then
Hell yeah

If you claimin' gangsta
Then bring on the system
And show that you ready to ride

'Til we get our freedom
We got to get over

Jay-Z,"When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

Yo, first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have their heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the rovers roll up wit ribbons
I seen them repo'd, resold then redriven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzlin'
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'm a be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God given
This is hard livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy

Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggaz can't make it to ballads to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racisms still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even make me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized each 3 or 4 times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
Its goin' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father past away
So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watchin' me from the other side

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you're apart of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm tryin' to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why it's spiritual
But I get my hymns from him
So it's not me it's he that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm tryin' to give us us free like Sinke
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the death
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of god reigns out

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get down

Who else you know been hot this long
Started from nothing but he got this strong
Built the ROC from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Peddled bikes, got my nephews peddle bikes because they special
Let you tell it man I'm fallin' well
Somebody must have caught him 'cause
Every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em
Number one albums what I got, like four of 'em
More of them on the way, the 8th wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissin' Jay will get you Mase'd
When I start spittin' them lyrics niggas get very religious
Six hail Mary's please Father forgive us

As I try to catch my breath and proceed
Lookin' at yo' sexy smile, while I put my vocals down
Girl you have made this song a hit in each and every town
You a sexy melody with a touch of freakin' harmony
Such a perfect chemistry
Girl we deserve a Grammy, or Soul Train
Billboard, MTV or BET award
Rollin' like we on a tour
Ooh the way you put it down girl I can't take it
Sex was so good girl we've got to do the remix
'Cause girl you a mix master
When it comes to pumpin' you such a ghetto blaster
It's such a hit that I gotta bootleg it, yeah

[Chorus]

A melody is the chemistry, the way we click
It's like four part harmony and all that shit
Your waistline is the bassline, I ride that shit
Strung off your treble and I'm high as shit
We made love in the studio when we got together over and over again like a loop
Damn I'm missin' you, it's hard to listen to
all these different dudes, huggin' and kissin' you, fuck!

And in case you didn't know, I be the Twista
Hundred bombs in my pockets, put your ones up
I hear some niggaz lookin at me for the come up
Try to creep creep, I pull a gun up
I put a hole in the first nigga that run up
The ballers be Jay, are, and T
Spit it cold cause the music is a part of me
Can't nobody spit it fast as me
Got an academy of haters comin after me
I know I got what you want, I know I got what you need
Come and mob to the top before you get, this, money

Pull up on the block in the alien gray Bentley
Full of sport modes, you never could hang with me
Just to get in early, I paid a extra 50
Gettin that money my nigga
Oh-five Chrysler, trees for the blunts
Three hoes in the back, two fiends in the front
Twenty-two inch shoes, CV's in the trunk
Gettin that money my nigga
Makin dough off a style I be the best in
Glad to be down with these two livin legends
Now let me see which league I'ma invest in
Gettin that money my nigga
Rollin this cheer, put the niggaz in fear
Makin bitches shed tears, take a look at my career
Now the shit's swell; when I get up to 70 in the Coupe
Peep the wing when I hope out the tail - tell 'em Kel

We off up in the club, we got our hands up
Drinks in the club because we gettin that money my nigga
We rollin 24's, open them Bentley do's
Got plenty hoes because we gettin that money my nigga

Pull up to the club, chicks in the back
Some smokin on weed, some sippin Co-gnac
Into the club, whole crew to the back
Super the stars make it sharp as a tack
Gotta have my forty-five inch in it
In the house, from the gate, twenty minutes
Game over and I'm still not finished
I play haters like V play tennis
Livin like a motherfuckin Richie Rich nigga
Got a butler for my Maybach nigga
White linen, smokin ci-gar
Lyrics like bullets, tongue like a trigger
Feelin on your booty
Tryin to get one of these nice ladies
to come up to my room and do, me
Have her man like who's, he
Was a pimp at birth, first ho was a nurse
And I'ma be a pimp 'til I'm stretches in a hearse
Sometimes showbiz is the worst
I'm blessed with ""The Gift & The Curse,"" whoa
Shoot ball, now I'm off to the spa
Fresh and clean, now I'm off in the car
Got a date with a superstar
We take lunch, now twelve o'clock
Hit the mall bout two o'clock
In the movies bout five o'clock
Seven o'clock 'til nine o'clock

Pimps hustlers herb flippers, get, this, money

[Chorus]

Gettin this money switchin my whips and my kicks
Like I'm just addicted to difference you pick what you want from me
To be a, lame with visions of riches, enter my brain
Like I picture myself in deep dishes, just switchin lanes
It's just insane, is it? I'm from the district where niggaz
either in prison or pay visits like in-laws
So we fend for ourself, and the wealth is in raw
We can't help but been lost, what else gon' make that engine roar?
Lay back in 745, big boy cars, that's all we drive
Into the club we get all the eyes when you gettin that money my nigga

Hit the 'tel with two chicks and she with it
Mama got down like the flo' when she did it

We'll be reunited and it feels so hood
Have the whole world saying ""How you still so good?""

They say if you love it, you should let it out its cage
And fuck it, if it comes back you know it's there to stay
It's tugging, at my heart, but this time apart is needed
From the public, who should've gave me the pulits'
Instead gave me they ass to kiss
But you know me, thugging 'til the casket dips
But still shine light down on all my peers
I know they weird, some queer, I still want them to share
And all the success I received, I know you can't believe
I still love 'em but they don't love me
They like the drunk uncle in your family
You know they lame, you feel ashamed, but you love 'em the same
It's like when niggas make subliminal records
If it ain't directed directly at me, I don't respect it
You don't really want it with Hov, for the record
I put a couple careers on hold, you could be next kid
Keep entering the danger sone
You gon' make that boy Hov put your name in a song
If you that hungry for fame, motherfucker come on
Say when, take ten paces and spin
But on another note, 'bout to take another vaca'
On another boat, goddamn a motherfucker rode
His way out the hood, and I pray that I stay out for good
But any day you know a nigga could
Try and play like he Suge, then I gotta play like Dutch Schults
You pass the dutchie, I blast you, trust me
Niggas can't fuck with me
I'm in a good mood, you lucky, I got a good groove
And I ain't trying to fuck my thing up
But I will lay down a couple green bucks, get you cleaned up
Now I'm Pulp Fiction, Colt four-fifth and
Young niggag that blast for me (blasphemy), no religion

Listen here summer baby, I just believe it's the right thing to do
I got a brand new bitch, corporate America
She showing me a lot of action right now
And I know you put me on my feet and all, but
I mean, it's time for me to grow
You gotta let me go baby, you gotta let me go

I'm done for now, so one for now
Possibly forever, we had fun together
But like all good things, we must come to an end
Please show the same love to my friends

I gotta shake you off
Cause the loving's ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake you off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake you off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake you off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off

By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
'Cause I'll be on my way

See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say 'I told you so'

Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively

So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

[Chorus]

I gotta shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets

Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'm a hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind

You wasn't worth my time
I've leaving you behind
'Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because

I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know

Hypnotic for Henny, now nigga that's your chaser
Turn nothing to something now pimpin' that's a savior
Best things are green now pimp and get your paper
High off the ground instead of skyscraper
Too low thinkin' we local, come on homie, we major

I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line, should it be about the hos or the ice?
Four-four's or black Christ? Both flows would be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man's plight
At the studio console asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic
Picked up the pad and pencil and jotted what I feel
Been like 12 years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent
And I'm thinking it's time
To build my very own Motown
Cause rappers be deprived of executive 9 to 5s
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony where King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Lasting longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke.

Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never is orientation
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away

You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up and watch how we roll up and
I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that yak, I want to fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing
Towel under the door smoke until the days end
Puff, puff then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hypnotic for Henny, now nigga that's your chaser
Turn nothing to something now pimpin' that's a savior
Best things are green now pimp and get your paper

Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(Forever)

Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they Jacob? Don't lie to me, man
See, a part of me sayin' ""Keep shining""
How? When I know what a blood diamond is
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connects to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus-piece was so harmless
Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life trying to get that ice
Bought a Polo rugby, it looks so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight

(Diamonds are forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(Forever)

People asking me ""Is I'm gon' give my chain back?""
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog, ""Yo where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance that bring our rain back
""What's up with you and Jay, man?
Are y'all okay man?""

Yup, I got it from here 'Ye, damn
The chain remains, the gang is intact
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gonna crack?
Haha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep
I sold kilos of coke, I'm guessin' I can sell CDs
I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man!
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere
Oh yeah, he don't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money, last 3 lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear saying exactly
What I've been saying practically my whole career
A diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes, well sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talked about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
It's for yourself, that's important
If your stripper name ""Porscha"" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man

I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
30 minutes later sein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call, you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?""

Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so numb, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so numb, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you

Whole game tighter now
Movin' a brick a week
Plus a nigga price is down
We them niggaz to see
Time to start the arising now
I don't know what's wrong with Bleek

It seems, I'm like Keenan, picking up on the vibe
That he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividin the loot
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car
Matchin' the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggaz think I fell out the loop
Cause the last time they seen me hoppin', out the Coupe
I hopped out in a suit

Look at this nigga Jay frontin' tryin' to take my shine
I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind
Plus I'm puffin like an ounce, more than I used to puff
Takin' advice from these niggaz but they ain't used to stuff
They had me thinkin, ""Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff
While he drive around town in brand new Coupe's and stuff""
Swear to God, they had me practically hating his guts
As he approached I spoke, ""Jigga whattup?""

Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart
I felt his hatred it was harsh, 'fore this fakin shit start
I should take him in back of the building and blaze him

Uh-oh, this nigga Jay he ain't slow, he musta picked up on the vibe
And had I, not been so high I woulda been able to hide
Tried to cover up myself, as I gave him a five
Hugged him, as if I loved him

To the naked eye
It woulda seemed we was the closest, but to those that know us
Could see that somethin' was about to go down

Stay focused
I'm tryin' to concentrate, but it's like he's reading my mind
As if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
Could he see I had plans on, bein the man

At nine I used to geese hoes for Easter clothes
Peep the steez, I represent for all those
With twenty eight grams, on a come-up trying to creep the keys
Large niggas told me park the car, keep the keys
Find a hoodrat and creep to mickey d's
First gun two bullets, niggas know I do pull it
Niggas trying to kill me dog, who wouldn't?
Screw Gooden, I pitch in the pj's
Lit off the ej, I split dutchies with my ring finger
You find a bitch that don't be cream, bring her
Last seen with Bing, he got dropped between us
Shit is constant, that's why I pack the
Johnson and Johnson for the nonsense who wants it?
I go to sleep with a picture of a Porsche on my wall
Man I'm trying to come up on y'all
Get one up on y'all, that's why I hustle in these streets
From sundown to sunup on y'all
Mama said keep bullshitting they'll kill you dead
One week of this hustling brought a living room set
Went to ? d's, niggas mad, veins out
Copped the Jordan's, two weeks before they came out

If I should die

Don't cry my niggas it's been one hell of a ride my niggas
In the middle of the trial I flip pies my niggas
I did joints with Mary J. Blige my niggas
I've eluded the coppers got booted with Big Poppa
Skated through with the Ceasar Picadas
At high school got head by the lockers
Gassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers
Rocked jewels dropped school still didn't fail
Rhymes still written well hold court in the street
Never sit in the cell for a second then I'm gettin' my bail
Shoot it out with the bounty hunters fuck
Sittin' in the county for summers if they should down me
Everybody around us become one for that day
To live life get your shit right & play
Don't get it twisted like rays if I miss that's ok
But life's short don't miss a day uhh

Got my crack on ten years later gettin' my rap on
Gettin' shorties like a thespian
Had an episode with two lesbians got a fetish for that
Drunk ginseng with Japanese chicks & pulled the root out
Squeeze my whole clip to survive shootouts
Been on both coasts fired all kinds of heat
Probably be kinda glad to leave these mean streets
I got dead mens to meet and questions to fulfill
Like is that mystery God real?
And how was Kennedy killed? I ain't mad
I must've smoked a ton of reefer sipped Coronas
With Latifah broke the code of Geneva
I know when I reach the other side I'ma see the
Cat I had beef with who blood remains on my sneaker
Then it's on again if I could be born again
I live my life through my son
And tell him never have a friend
Just family reincarnated I'll show him the time
That I waited to get paid tell him never be afraid

Never shed tears cry liquor my nigga

Born to live forever through life's struggles
I cut corners & took drastic measures
See you niggas life expire right in front of me
Time could never mend what these cold streets
Mentally done to me too often I close my eyes
And see my own coffin feelin' haunted ready to leave
This world that I'm lost in my only chance
To see the seeds I lost through abortion
When I'm gone y'all niggas better not mourn
Keep flossin' as long as my name
Lives on what's most important
I'll be down in hell scorchin' preparin' for life
Afterlife still torchin' & blazin' these mics
It'd rain for 40 days & 40 nights
& I'd return on the 3rd like Christ
Without my physical portion
My spirit a poltergeist for sure
I'll be back through the heist tomorrow
Blood over y'all fake niggas door

If I should die

I'd tell Big they're still hearin' his songs
Run into Pac ask him where we went wrong
Tell him life is miserable when ya dealin' in the physical form
Is everything that's invisible gone?
I need to know will I still feel pain or will it be ironic?
Will I chill in the flames for all the ills of my brain?
Can I reveal the game to all the hustlers
Trapped in the race and if so can I leave this place?
Can I puff cigars & drink Cristal?
If this is heaven to me is this considered heavenly?
Can I still touch lives answer they ""whats & whys""
Make sure everybody in my fam' clutch five?

Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whipping curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting
Stand back

And, 1st and 15 is just a sewing machine
So I, cut the pattern and I, sew in seams
And, button in this hustling then publicly I'm Buddy Lee
There's no busting them and cuffing them is like
Ushering in the regime, they want me to make Prince pants
But I withstand, I ain't gotten into that
A little big in the waist, Tupac it on the back
Call them Nu-vi's, O.G.'s covered in blue dye
Give 'em the game, that's like giving chocolate to the fat
Look, how you think I got here?
That's the same game that came through where I lived as a kid
In the bad luck truck and threw boxes off the back
Made me a ripper, deliver like river
Content a little more thicker, slicker
Yeah, and they said oil and water don't mix
Now they all down at the beach washing off the fish
Was Blackbeard 'til I brought the Roc into your ships

It's my life, my life, everything I do I do for you
I do it all for you, everything I say you know it's the truth
I'll say it is the truth, I'll take all the pressure off of you

Beware if you wanna Roc the Knickerbocker
Other nigga from the block what, they was selling O's
Like Wheel of Fortune, of imported cocaine
Just to feel important, it was Do or Die
They was tired of being ""Po' Pimps,"" now for sure
That was just a product of my common sense
I guess, I was just guessing like the consonants
Momma said beware of what the devil do
Tell 'em that your soul's not for sale like the W's

Don't get it twisted
Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo

Yo shut the fuck up 'fore I blast and banned from T.V. your ass
With no mask, look at the camera like what?
Yeah I did it like them sick white boys the court committed
To the death of me, I'm spaz like I'm on Ecstasy
Drop 100 bars for real like I'm lookin' for a deal
If I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids
I ain't straight 'til my numbers match the Motorola bid
And walk the streets up in the wild like I don't fuckin' care
If I ain't strapped that means I took 'em off my Nike Airs
Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children

When I ride mine like bitches when I walk up in the building
'Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores
Jet-skiin', while you keep warm at corner stores
I make it hot, floodin' your block, the best way
Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-ray
As I get roasted lookin' at Biggie posted on my wall
Takin' shots of Louie 'til I fall
Nuttin' to lose, just load the clip up in the groove
And kick rhymes to the poster, 'til I swear big move
My team, you would think was on Thorazine
How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's costing

Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now
Pick out a quiet town and tie it down
Make niggaz lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now
Beanie Mac I supply it now
My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats
Couple of 5's, a 6, a few jeeps
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks
In case niggaz wanna test, vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name? And test my game?
Until you have me, test my aim?
Y'all niggaz nuts, like testricles

Hit you up in your apartment buildin' vestibule
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walkin'
Heat from the noggin', keep on sparkin'
Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparklin'
Cop off the lot never see me at the auction
Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawkin'
Out on the strip, until I reach the margin
Not tryin' to meet the Sergeant, at the precinct
Eatin' cheese sandwiches, down for the weekend
Locked up with dirty white boys and Ricans

Now if I kill you I probably do ten in the box
Come down on appeal then I'm killin' your pops
You feelin' the Lox, nigga why you grillin' the Lox
If this rap shit don't work niggaz still in the spot
You bring it to me, I gotta lose your family
Gangstas don't die, they get chubby, and move to Miami
Shit is deep now dog, but it gets deeper
Fuck it, the weather's nice and the price is much cheaper
I put it on tape, you gon' buy it, I put it in a bag
You gon' try it, y'all niggaz can't deny it

Lot of cats still tryin' to study my last bounce
Tell you what, get a beat tape and a half ounce
They got me where I can't be without my large gat
Teflon long sleeve, and my hardhat
Don't matter if I'm openin' up, or headline
Doin' the speed limit or pushin' red lines
Six months in the county or fed time
I'm a be the 'Kiss nigga, until it's bedtime

Anything I'm on is a classic, any nigga
Ever had beef with, son is a bastard
Anytime I spit, spit acid, L O X
Ruff Ryder you heard? We got the game mastered
I told you the pain was comin'
You wouldn't listen
You tried to play me like a joke?
Now who got the last laugh?
Now take these bullets with you to Hell

You motherfuckers is sick, don't think sauce the shit
So many niggaz on my nuts I thought I lost my dick
Picture me fallin' off, I'm camera shy
Hammers fly, might miss you, but your man'll die
What's the difference? Either way I'm stunnin' your crew
I fuck to win, y'all niggaz comin' to lose
Somethin' to prove? Spit it, we can have a spray off
I lay off wet niggaz and kill em on my day off

Ain't nuttin' for me to bust a trey off
Murder the whole month of April nigga, just to take May off
Run with more Germans than Adolf, you light crews
Now I concentrate on your camp, like Jews
Flow hot like a heatwave bitch
Whips fatter than them shits they beat slaves with
I'm a meal stackin' nigga who pull quick, still packin'
For you Phil Jackson niggaz on that bull

I don't give a fuck who you are, so fuck who you are
I don't care about a pretty bitch, watch or a car
I don't care about your block and whoever you shot
I don't care about your album and whenever it drop
I don't care about your past if I did I woulda asked
I'm too busy lightin' 'dro with a whole lotta hash
Far as this rap shit, I'm ten steps ahead of niggaz
Shootin' backwards, just for practice

Ride or die nigga, hoppin' in your casket
'Bout to go to Hell with you, blow the L with you
Tell the whole world I'm spittin', let em know the shells hit you
I tell niggaz quick, suck dick and get a glock
My name ring bells like Sunday at 12 o'clock
I'm half past 7, bust 6 then 11
You know me, slide my man my joint say reload me
I ruffryde and pop a fella for Roc-a-Fella
Jay, what the fuck, spendin' Mozzarella

I know pop you can't stand us 'cause you cock them hammers
Run in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma
Locked in the slammer? Nope, popped up in Atlanta
Crossed up in a drop I popped up the antenna
Whoa, watch your manners when my veins pop like scanners
Like raindrops you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon
Big thang, big chains, ain't shit changed
Get brained in the four dot six range
Shit main, switch lanes
Every town I hit, switch planes, bitch flipped Big Caine
Flow with no cut, you take it in vain to the brain

Motherfuckers is noddin' and throwin' up, you know that
You don't wanna owe that man
He'll hit you, get the picture? Kodak man
Gotta, love for war, I don't floss no more
I just sit on my money 'til I'm above the law
How the fuck you gonna stop us with your measly asses?
We don't stop at the tolls we got E Z passes, nigga

To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggaz know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggaz with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me mom I rub on your tits, and what-not

Let's stick up the world and split it fifty/fifty, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh

Burn em down and you can have it back daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin, they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see you vision mama, I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Now I'm a be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot; sleepin on futons and cots
To King Size, dream machines, the green fives
I've seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type braile
I'm tight grill with the phony, rappers y'all might feel we homies
I'm like still, y'all don't know me, shit!

Gotta a lot of beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustling's still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed, to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it, til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, X'ed your name out

Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em
Probably end up back in the hood, like fuck it then

Huddlin' over the oven, we were like brothers then
Though you were nothin' other then the son of my mother's friend
We had governin' who would have thought the love would end
Like ice cold albums, all good things
Never thought we'd sing the same song that all hoods sing
Thought it was all wood grain, all good brain
We wouldn't bicker like the other fools, talk good game
Never imagine all the disaster that one could reign
Could bring, should blame the game and I could
It's kill or be killed, how could I refrain
Forever be in debt and that's never a good thing
So the pressure for success can put a good strain
On the friend you call best, and yes it could bring
Out of the worst in every person, even the good saint'
And though we rehearsed it, it just ain't the same
When you put in the game at age sixteen
Then you mix things like cars, jewelry, and Miss Thing

Jealously, ego and pride and this brings
It all to a head like a coin, cha-ching
The route of evil strike again, this could sting
Now the team got beef between the post and the point
This puts the ring in jeopardy

Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like fuck it then

I'm back in the hood, they like 'Hey Nas'
Blowin' on purp, reflecting on they lives
Couple of fat cats, couple of AI's
Dreamin' of fly shit, instead of them grey skies
Gray 5's, hate guy, wishin' our reign dies
Pitch sling pies and niggas they sing 'Why?'
Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time
Weak minds keep tryin' follow the street signs
I'm standing on the roof of my building, I'm feelin'
The whirlwind of beef I inhale it just like an acrobat
Ready to hurl myself through the hoops of fire
Sippin' eighty proof, bulletproof under my attire
Could be the forces of darkness
Against hood angels of good that form street politics
Makes a sweet honest kid turn illegal for commerce
To get his feet out of them Converse
That's my word!

My heart was soaken and I broken in a young world

(so true, so true, listen)

I wasn't tryin to lead her on
See I didn't wanna be alone
But when she smiles she braught me home
So I braught her home,
Its not that the fealin of love is gone
Can't expect a kind little girl to be grown
I can't give a fuck what so and so says
Crushes hurt both ways

Young girl, so in love with you

The single girls are out tonight
But you have one word, my heart, one life
And I'm not lookin around
So why you lookin down
(what you lookin down for?)

I fucked up a long time ago
See I should have never let you know
See I couldnt give a fuck what tabloids say
(as the people magazine)
And crushes hurt both ways

Jay-Z,"You ain't got enough stamps in your passport to fuck with young H-O
International,
Show y'all young boys how to do this thing

The maturation of Jay-Z, Z
Check me out

30's the new twenty, nigga
I'm so hot still
Better broad, better automobile
Bet a yard, nah, bet a hundred mill
Then by the songs end, I probably start another trend
I know everything you wan do
I did all that by the age of twenty-one
By twenty-two I had that brand new Ack Coupe
I guess you can say that my legend just begun
I'm young enough to know the right car to buy
Yet grown enough not to put rims on it
I got that six-deuce with curtains so you can't see me
And I didn't even have to put tints on it
I don't got the bright watch, I got the right watch
I don't buy out the bar, I bought the night spot
I got the right stock
I got stockbrokers that's movin' it like white tops
I know you like fuck this is child abuse
Call diapers, I might just be gettin' nicer
Them young boys ain't ready for real
30's the new twenty, nigga
I'm so hot still

I used to let my pants sag, not givin' a fuck
Bad boy, now I'm all grown up
I use to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Bad boy, now I'm all grown up
I use to play the block like that (like that)
I use to carry knots like that (like that)
Now I got black cards, good credit and such
Bad boy, 'cause I'm all grown up

30's the new twenty, nigga, I'm on fire still
These young boys is like a fire drills (uh)
False alarms (uh)
Next don? (nah)
He got (on)
To the next one (young)
I'm still here (yeah)
Still here like Mike, gotta stop playin' with these children's (yeah)
I'm a bully with the bucks
Don't let the patten leather shoes fool you, youngin'
I got the fully in the tux
That was my past, now I'm so grown up
I don't got one gun army, got a slum army
To hire a gun army, get you spun like laundry
And I'll be somewhere under palm trees calmly
Listen to R and B when we get the call he's
No longer wit' us, fire your babysitters
You lil' fucks fall back for real
30's the new twenty, nigga
I'm so hot still

I used to let my pants sag, not givin' a fuck
Bad boy, now I'm all grown up
I use to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Bad boy, now I'm all grown up
I use to play the block like that (like that)
I use to carry knots like that (like that)
Now I got black cards, good credit and such
Bad boy, 'cause I'm all grown up

Y'all roll blunts, I smoke Cubans all day
Y'all youngin's chase, I'm Patron, and it's Grey
I like South Beach, but I'm in Saint Tropez
Y'all drink Dom but not Rose (hey)
Your chick shop in the mall
My chick burnin' down Berdolph's
Comin' back with Birken Bags
Your chick is like what type of purse is that?
I'm from the era where niggas don't snitch
You from the era where snitchin' is the shit
I'm afraid of the future (why?)
Y'all respect the one who got shot
I respect the shooter
Y'all go to parties to ice grill
I go to parties to party with nice girls

Jay-Z,"Life is but a dream to me, I don't wanna wake up
30 odd years been 'bout havin' my cake up
So I'm 'bout my paper, 24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year
I don't know why we here, since we gotta be here
Life is but a beach chair (chair, chair chair)
Went from havin' shabby clothes to crossin' over Abbey Road
Hear my angel singin' to me (Are you happy, Hov?)
I just hope I'm hearin' right, karma's got me fearin' like
Kalik are you prayin' for me? (for me)
See I got demons in my past so I got daughters on the way
If the prophecy's correct that the child shall have to pay
For the sins of her father so I barter my tomorrows
Against my yesterdays and hope that she'll be okay
And when I'm no longer here to shade her face from the glare
I give up my share of Carol's daughter and a new beach chair

[Chorus]
(I hear my angels sing) Life is just a dream and I wanna go, wake up
(I hear my angels sing) Life is just a dream and I wanna leave
(I hear my angels sing) Life is just a dream and I wanna go, wake up
(I hear my angels sing) Life is just a dream and I wanna leave

Life is but a dream to me, gunshots sing to these
Other guys but lullabies don't mean a thing to me
I'm not afraid of dyin', I'm afraid of not tryin'
Every day hit every wave like I'm Hawaiian
I don't surf the net, no I never been on MySpace
Too busy lettin' my voice vibrate
Carvin' out my space, in this world of fly girls
Cutthroats and diamond cut ropes I twirls
Benzes 'round corners where the sun don't shine
I let the wheels give a glimpse of hope and one's grind
Son said ""Hov, how you get so fly?""
I said ""from not bein' afraid to fall out the sky""
My physical's a shell so when I say farewell
My soul'll find and even higher plane to dwell
So fly you shall, so have no fear
Just know that life is but a beach chair (chair, chair)

[Chorus]

Life is but a dream, can't mimic my life
I'm the thinnest cut slice in a cut, the winner's cup
Well winter's rough enough to interrupt life
That's why I'm both saint and sinner, nice
This is Jay everyday, no compromise
No compass comes wit' this life, just eyes
So to map it out you must look inside
Sure books can guide you but your heart defines you
Chica, the corazon is what brought us home
The great shape like Heidi Klum mighty gone, I am on 
Permanent vaca', life is but a beach chair
Song's like a Hallmark card until you reach here
So 'til she's here, and she's declared
The heir, I will prepare
A blueprint for you to print, a map for you to get back
A guide for your eyes so you won't lose scent
I make it stink for you think I ink these verses
Full of prose so you won't get conned out of two cents
My last will and testament I leave my heir
My share of Roc-A-Fella Records and a shiny new beach chair

No tears no tissue, not an issue
Don't cry for me I peep these niggas from deep
By the front row seat even if you don't speak
Silent pardon, I hear you loud and clear
You left your finger print, you ain't gotta be there
I'm just waiting 'till you dig a hole big enough to put your whole body in
Then I'm goin' body them
It's nothing but a hobby to him
Simple as serve and volley to him

Shunning the one thing that they owe their life to
You let that man hype you to go against your idol
Knowing good and god damn well this what I do
Think I'm in the office I lost my grind
That's how kids become orphans, you lost your mind?
I keep my enemies close
I give 'em enough rope
They put themselves in the air

NO Hov, daddy goin' spank your for that shit you said
It's hard to do, when you got nothing to prove
Everybody know you better, you in a lose lose
Even if you win, ultimately you lose
Real niggas like, ""why Hov talking to dude""
He's selling low too
Only time you went plat
My chain was around your neck, that's an actual fact
So I'm praying that it spills outside of the Booth
That's when y'all niggas outside of your truth
Outside of your league, that's not what you do
Niggas throwing ROC signs outside of your coupe
Dun look at Hove like he dun something wrong to em
He just took what belong to 'em
Niggas playing Checkers with Chess playing Hov
This game is over I dunno if y'all know
You in a hole

You're watching (It's all good)
It's kinda sexy to me (I love it)
How you're watching, you're watching
I see your face (I see your face)

Oh, it's the lights (You're blinded by the)
Satisfaction (You need that)
Hollywood (uh, uh, uh, uh, c'mon)

Paparazzi spots me in the lobby of my high rise
I hide behind my shades because the fame is blindin' my eyes
My god, I know how Ozzy Oz must have felt when he was Oz hot
As I have got, I have got to make this stop
People often warn me that the fame ain't for the faint of heart
It'll change those 'cause if they had love for you into strangers
When the fame starts, it's a chain reaction
Locomotion like when a train departs
Stranger things have happened
Rappin', stackin' platinum plaques
Born in Brooklyn, got a place in Manhattan
Goin' back to Brooklyn to escape the madness
When your friends is Chris and Gwyneth
When your girl is more famous than Juventus
Then it's time to get all your windows tinted
Keep your eyes squinted, it's goin' flash any minute
The music biz is like musical chairs
It's about where you stand when the music stop spinnin'

But you don't need it
Till you do, till you do

Hey mister, page sixer
A-lister, you're in the midst of
The ride of your life, but you gotta keep them hits up
Can't put your guard down, gotta keep your mitts up
Take a sip, sir, it's so intoxicating ain't it?
Try not to get jaded
Hollywood's been good to ya
Startin' to feel like buzz to ya
Don't lie, go on fly, you're addicted to the light
Without the fame, how you gon' survive?
It's like bein' on heroin, you so high

And everybody's warning you about it (I tried to tell you)
And once you taste it you can't live without it (It's addicting)
Not 'cause you choose to not live without it (you sure you want this, baby?)
It's now a part of you, it's now a part of you (It's a part of you)
And everybody's warning you about it
And once you taste it you can't leave

Oh, it's the lights (You're blinded by the)
Action! (You need that)
Hollywood (uh, uh, uh, uh)
Oh, it's the lights (You're blinded by the)
Satisfaction (You need that)

Wanna be seen now, groupies
Now you've become what you once despised
James Dean, John Belushi, blow your whole life trying to live in the lights
Heroin's following, Marijuana hopping over the edge
It's like Janis Joplin
River Pheonix, Jimi Hendrix
Jimmy Morrison, all of them ended by Hollywood
Thank God for Hollywood

No HBO, WHT
Just Ralph McDaniel's on the station
I aggravated you for Atari and Coleco Vision
Pinstripe Lee's when the first day day of school came
I was OK with not having everything as long as Saturdays
You had the Commodores playing
The expression on your face was priceless
Still with me till this day
Baby girl I won't erase it
I go to my grave with the memory of the sacrifice you made
You deserve a standing ovation
Momma I made it

[Chorus: x3]

Now your lil' misfit makes sure every day is Christmas
Write out your wish list
Sixes, wrist is glistening
You don't even like jewels
But you can get missing anywhere you like to
Where the water's light BLUE
Anything you order, sign it to your nice room
Leave an extra tip Ma
Be extra nice to 'em
CEO Carter Foundation
Wow I know pop's looking down
I know Colleek somewhere up in the clouds
Like go get 'em Grandma, make me proud
Didn't have a man in the house so you made one
So I act like ya husband and I'm only ya son
I told you one day I'll get you a home
But I didn't know it would possibly be in Rome
Told me don't wait on nobody
Get your own, so with me myself & my microphone I made it

Not only NYC, I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor

When Kingdom come, you ready?
The king will come, I'm ready
I'm ready

Now everywhere I go, they like Hovi back
Up out the corner office of cul-de-sac
Where's Iceberg Slim? He was the coldest cat
Get your swag back, daddy; where your focus at?
Got to admit a lil' bit, I was sick of rap
But despite that the boy is back
And I'm so evolved, I'm so involved
I'm showin' growth, I'm so in charge
I'm CEO and, yeah, goin' God
I'm so indebted I should of been debted
Sellin' blow in the park, this is knowin' my heart
Now I'm so enlightened I might glow in the dark
I been up in the office you might know him as Clark
Just when you thought the whole world fell apart, I
Take off the blazer, loosen up the tie
Step inside the booth, Superman is alive

When Kingdom come, you ready?

Not only NYC, I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor

I hear 'Hurry up, Hov' when I'm out in the public
These niggas like that you love it, you be it, you're of it
You breathe it, we need it, bring it back for the hustlers
Have you dust off the hammer, dance, can't touch this
C'mon, playboys, bring your cars back out
Cause your boy Hov is back, you know them broads coming out
Got 'em dancin' on the banquet like they from Bankhead
Fuck crystal so they ask what we drinking
I thought dudes were marquess rudoque
So I moved on to dom and crew rose
And it's much bigger issues in the world I know
But I first had to take care of the world I know
I'm from the bottom, so I still feel I'm from the bottom
Underdog before my cake and still couldn't stop him
Flash Gordon bring my cords and spark the light in the dark
Peter Parker, Spider-Man, all I do is climb the charts

Just when they thought it was all over
I put the whole world on my back in broad shoulders the ball hover
Who you know took over tracks like that?
Guess what, New York, New York we back
And I ain't never been afraid of a drought
Since I was 6 17 they gettin' money down south
'Bout it, 'bout it Master P
Ask the nigga Pimp C, ask my homie Bun B
I run the streets, the streets don't run we
Y'all run, we chill, still waters run deep
I repeat, sing along with me
I run the streets, the streets don't run we

It's just a real song
Feel me?

I heard motherfuckers saying they made Hov
Made Hov say, ""Okay, so make another Hov.""
Niggas wasn't playing they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo
I should a been did it, but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends, business interests as they go
Ain't nothing left to say though
I guess we forgot what we came fo'
Should a stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossing
Too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a bitch, but I gotta divorce them
Hov have to get the shallow shit up off him
And I ain't even want to be famous
Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I ain't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is
The worst drug known to man
It's stronger than heroin
When you could look in the mirror like, ""There I am""
And still not see what you've become
I know I'm guilty of it too, but not like them
You lost one

Lose one, let go to get one
Left one, lose some to win some (You lost one)
Sorry, I'm a champion
Sorry, I'm a champion
You lost one

I don't think it's meant to be, be
But she loves her work more than she does me
And honestly, at twenty-three
I would probably love my work more than I did she
So, B, ain't we?
It's me and her
'Cause what she prefers over me is work
And that's where we differ
So I have to give her
Free time even if it hurts
So breathe, mami, it's deserved
You've been put on this earth to be
All you can be, like the reserves
And me? My time in the army - it's served
So I have to allow she, her, time to serve
The time's now for her
In time she'll mature
And maybe we can be we again, like we were
Finally, my time's too short to share
And to ask her now, it ain't fair
So, yeah, she lost one

Lose one, let go to get one
Left one, lose some to win some (You lost one)
Sorry, I'm a champion
Sorry, I'm a champion
You lost one

My nephew died in the car I bought
So I'm under the belief it's partly my fault
Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought
Place any burden on me, but please, not that, Lord
Time don't go back, it go forward
Can't run from the pain, go towards it
Some things can't be explained, what caused it?
Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit
Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it
Till that time, little man, I'm nauseous
Your girlfriend's pregnant, the lord's gift
Almost lost my faith, that restored it
It's like having your life restarted
Can't wait for your child's life to be a part of it
So now I'm child-like waiting for a gift to return
When I lost you, I lost it

Lose one, let go to get one
Left one, lose some to win some (Colleek, I lost one)

Jay-Z,"The damage here along the gulf coast is catastrophic
There's a frantic effort under way tonight to find
survivors. There are an uncounted number of the dead tonight
People are being forced to live like animals
We are desperate
No one says the federal government is doing a good job
And hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people
No water, I fought my country for years
We need help, we really need help
In Baghdad, they they drop, they air drop water, food to people
why cant they do that to their own people?
The same idiots that can't get water into a major 
American city in less than three days are trying to win a war

People was poor before the hurricane came
But the down pour poured is like when Mary J. sang
Every day it rains, so every day the pain
But ignored them, and showed em the risk was to blame
For life is a chain, cause and effected
Niggas off the chain because they affected
It's a dirty game so whatever is effective
From weed to selling 'kane, gotta put that in effect
Wouldn't you loot, if you didn't have the loot?
Baby needed food and you stuck on the roof
Helicopter swooped down just to get a scoop
Through his telescopic lens but he didn't scoop you
The next five days, no help ensued
They called you a refugee because you seek refuge
The commander-in-chief just flew by
Did he stop? No, he had a couple seats
Just proved jet blue he's not
Jet flew by the spot
What if he ran out of jet fuel and just dropped
That would of been something to watch
Helicopters doing flybys to take a couple of shots
Couple of portraits then ignored 'em
He'd be just another bush surrounded by a couple orchids
Poor kids just 'cause they were poor kids
Left 'em on they porches same old story in New Orleans
Silly rappers, because we got a couple Porches
MTV stopped by to film our fortresses
We forget the unfortunate
Sure I ponied up a mill, but I didn't give my time
So in reality I didn't give a dime, or a damn
I just put my monies in the hands of the same people that left my people stranded
Nothin' but a bandit
Left them folks abandoned
Damn, that money that we gave was just a band-aid
Can't say we better off than we was before
In synopsis this is my minority report
Can't say we better off than we was before
In synopsis this is my minority report

So many times I'm, covering my eyes
Peeking through my fingers
Tryin' to hide my, frustration at the way that we treat
(Seems like we don't even care)
Turn on the TV, seein' the pain
Sayin' such a shame
Then tryin' to go on with my life
Of that, I too, am guilty
(Seems like we don't even care)
So we send a lil' money, tell 'em it's alright
To be able to sleep at night
You will pay that price
While some of these folks' lost their whole life
(Seems like we don't even care)
Now it wasn't on the nightly news no more
Suddenly it didn't matter to you no more
In the end almost nothing changed
What the hell, what was that for?

First he brought that crack back like a yo-yo though 
Don't play with my yo-yo, loco niggas in the hood 
First niggas hating on me, its all good 
I'm buying things like my shit don't stink 
Gucci links and Gucci gooses, watching too many movies 
Bullet proof this,
Had some nerve like pulling toothes 
When you 16, coming through roofless 
Yea ya boy ruthless 
Like ice cube was 
Turn the whole city on I'm the new plug 
So if this is ya first time hearing this

Someone so cold 
A journey, seldom seamed the american dream 
From the bottom to the top of the globe 
They call me hov

They coming for me, wanna see me fall 
They know my story, I been through it all 
Nights I felt like dying, but I ain't crying 
What didn't kill me, made me strong as I am 
I am, I am
Oh my god, hov

Now I'm knee deep in the concrete 
Like the streets made a quicksand that?s beyond deep 
I got a chemical romance, two left feet 
So now I dance with the devil please G.O.D. 
Save me from the black parade, release me 
My life like grand theft auto PSP 
I'm in the Volvo, puffin on the lala 
Ducking from the popo

Would you just look at him"" 
So sorry dear mama for your embarrassment 
But give me a couple years pray ill never sin again

Call me crazy but strangely I love the odds

Calling out my name to bring the boy backwards 
Shooting air balls at the basket 
What you call money, I pay more in taxes

Out in Niger?, do you have any idea? 
Sold out shows, albums his whole career 
Jo-burg, Dublin, Tanzania 
Lunch with Mandella, dinner with Cavalli 
Still got time to get water out to everybody 
Everybody, fall back

Ya lyrics didn't 
Ya gangsta look did it

Being intricate'll get ya wood critics 
On the internet 
They like you should spit it, I'm like you should buy it 
Nigga that's good business 
Forget this rap shit I need a new hustle 
A little bit of everything, a new improved Russell 
I say that reluctantly cause I do struggle 
As you see I can't leave so I do love you 
But I'm just a hustler disguised as a rapper 
In fact you can't fit this hustle inside of a wrapper 
Back when crack was what these pills are 
I was a real star complete with real cars 
No video ones, you can and come set up a camera 
Let the video run 
In my real life complete with real ice 
VVS boulders all invisibly set 
Head and shoulders my invisible neck 
You see hova wasn't digital yet 
Before Steve jobs made the ipod 
Was getting head jobs, we call that intimate 
Back when rappers wouldn't dare play lyrical roulette 
With an automatic weapon I was rapping with a tek 
Fresh like Manny be chain like antifreeze 
Shoe box full of cash 
Dealer man hand me keys 
Pantries full of arm n hammer 
Don't take Nancy drew to see what it do 
I'ma damn g 
Just sent a million dollars through a hands free 
That's big money talk can you answer me? 
Before the Answer was a 3 I was down in Georgetown with a Hoya chick, loyal chick 
Sure he's rich now 'cause he saw this shit, all this shit 
That's why they call him hov cause he came before all this shit 
Bought a 6, quarter 7 skipped on them quarter 8s 
Bought a 9 for nonstop glockwork all the time 
Guess who's back 
Since this is a New Era got a fresh new hat 
10 yr veteran 
I been said I been through with this bullshit game 
But I never can

You could take out its beat like nothing something 
Soon as you finish cutting you like leave me please, 
Not me I need Angelina Jolize company, 
So I ain't gonna make a move unless I got I got a plan B 
That'll happen the day I have a baby by free, 
Not to say that anything is wrong with free, 
Just to say that ain't nothing wrong with me

Whip it real hard, whip it whip it real hard
Ain't bout no funny shit still bitches and business

It's time to spend my thrills custom spinnin' wheels

Talk about me 'cause these suckers scared to talk about me
Killers chalkin' bout me, it ain't no talk about me
It ain't no walkin' 'round me, see all these killers 'round me
Lot of drug dealin' 'round me goin' down in Dade County
Don't tote no twenty-twos, Magnum cost me twenty-two
Sat it on them twenty-twos, birds go for twenty-two
Lil' mama super thick, she say she twenty-two
She seen them twenty-twos, we in room two twenty-two

Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go

I'd rather be at home with ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing
There's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway
I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no'
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know
(Now rocking with the best Amy baby)

The man said 'why do you think you here?'
I said 'I got no idea
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near'
He said 'I just think your depressed',

Young, uh
More money, more checks, I'm addicted to fresh
Six pair of kicks is my definition of 12 steps
Kick back in the back, get the phantom to drop
Bass blaring outta my system, that's how I detox
O when will he stop, he still pumping that real shit
My flow so dumb, my face is numb, nigga, I don't feel shit
Where's a therapist? Yeah, I'm outta control
They tryna make me go to rehab, I won't go, no
And so I'm addicted, I'm Britney, Whitney, and Bobby
Betty Ford ain't ready for us, ain't nothing can stop me
Oh look he's collapsing, just look how he's rapping
Every time I try to get out it pulls me back in
Amy should have rehabed him,'stead she doubled his ration
Can you blame me for being a slave to my passion?
My heroine flows more deeper than Marilyn's nose I'm an O.D.
'Til I'm in peace like Anna Nicole,
Hov!

I don't ever wanna drink again
I just ooh I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend

I've become so numb
Can I get an encore,
Do you want more (more)
Do you want more (more)

Get your ass up for the doctor
One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down

Times up, games over, you lose, I win
'bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad

You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'

Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

When dr. dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump

The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches

We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus

But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off
Who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what)
We gon' have this motherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to

First we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight

Now what the hell are you waitin' for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar

Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb
Can I get an encore, do you want more (more)

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved

And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally

Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker

So never say never cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady)
No one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh

Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar",Numb/Encore [Remix],2006

Put ya hand out the window, feel the force
Feel the Porsche, hit the frost

Uh-huh, put your hands together
Young, uh-huh, yeah
Uh-huh, yes

I'm from the 80's
Home of the heroin
Era of the hustlers
The world is my custy
New Rich Porter
The way I flip quarters
Front on all these other rap artists, but me
Momma was a mink wearer
Papa ran numbers
So it's plain to see where my whole plan come from
American dream
I'm living the life still
The way I shine is like a zillion dollar light bill
Still I'm grinding, army jacket lining
Forty below Timbs on, getting my M's on
My best friends gone, I seen bad days
Still find songs that I hear him on
Getting my Mary J. Blige ""Reminisce"" on
I hear his voice in my mind like, nigga live on
So I get on that fly shit I been on
Spin on corners in Enzo with rims on
But for info, puffing on Endo-Nesia
Give me amnesia
I ease up, that right, I'm high nigga
I want the sky
The world when I'm done
I'm give it to my sons
Let em live it up, split it up, switch it up
Sixes kit it up
Man I did it up, done
The rest of my belongings belong in the hall of fame
A list of hits next to all my names
I came

If the sky should fall
And it all goes tomorrow and they foreclose 
On the house and auction off all my cars
Don't cry for me Argentina
I mobbed the Beamer
Took trips abroad, got mobbed in Sardina
In Ibiza I had pizza in the club
Ladies know I'm that guy
They wanna piece of my love
Now they wanna do your boy like Mike in his prime
Billie Jean the goddamn boy ain't mine
And the Roc break up, had the people losing hope
Can't lie they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes
Now I'm back in the go mode, back in the go-go's
Throwing the diamond up, repping the logo
Rose gold rose flow
I'm okay though
What don't kill me makes stronger than before so
Here we go and I'm not domino
When it all falls down
I'm like Kanye's jaw
I might break but I don't fold til I hold the sky in my hand
Yeah that's my goal
And then I bid you Freddy Adu
Prodigal Child, y'all not ready for the future
Then I disappear in the Bermuda Triangle

I want the sky nigga, church",American Gangster,2007

Then came the dawn, and

I never felt that before
I never felt that before
I never felt that before
But there's always
That's all, that's all

This is the shit you dream about with the homies steaming out
Back-to-back, backing them Beemers out
Seems as our plans to get a grant
Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out
We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
For now, I'm just a lazy boy
Big dreaming in my La-Z-Boy
In the clouds of smoke, been playing this Marvin
Mama forgive me, should be thinking about Harvard
But that's too far away, niggas are starving
Ain't nothing wrong with my aim, just gotta change the target
I got dreams of bagging snidd-ow, the size of pillows
I see pies every time my eyes clidd-ose
I see rides, sixes, I got to get those
Life's a bitch, I hope to not make her a widow

I never felt that before

It's not quite near, and it's not like we're
Professionals, moving the decimals
Know where to cop? Nah! Got a connect? No!
Who in the F knows how to be successful
Need a ""personal Jesus,"" I'm in Depeche Mode
They say its celestial, its all in the stars
Like Tony LaRussa on how you play your Cards
Cause y'all ain't fucking with me! The ironies are
At all costs better avoid these bars
Now let's start, on your mark
Get set, let's go, get out the car
Going in circles it's a vicious cycle
This is a crash course, this ain't high school
Wake up Muttley, you're dreaming again
Your own reality show, the season begins

I never felt that before

I never felt that before
(Just American dreamin')
I never felt that before

But there's always
That's all, that's all

Step one in this process: scramble up in your projects
And head to the heights where big coke is processed
You gotta convince them that you're not from the precinct
Please speak slow cause he no speaky no English
If he takes a liking after a couple of trips
And your money is straight, he's going to give you consignment
You're now in a game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts, I wish you well hold up
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?
How sick am I? I wish you health
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself
You could see the signs when the jackers is scheming
And the cops is coming, you could read they mind
You could see from behind, you could redefine

Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino
You seen what that last run did to DeNiro
And he can't beat the odds, can't cheat the Gods
Can't blow too hard, life's a deck of cards
Now your tumbling is humbling, you're fallin', you're mumbling
Under your breath like you knew this day was coming
(Fallin') Now let's pray that arm candy
That you left your ex for stay down and come in handy
Cause come January it gets cold, when the letters start to slow
And your commissary's low, and lawyers screams appeal
Only thinking about a bill and your chances are nil

All you do is push-up, pull-up, sit-up
Locked down the town now belongs to the squares
Who said they won't make the same mistake that got you there
And your arm candy sweet on them
And the women that you left for this heffer
Got a college degree coming
Bad news keeps coming, hard to keep something on your stomach
You're sick about what your life is becoming

Ragging bad about all the new dudes
Talking tough on the Youtube
About what you used to do
But that's old school to the new crew
They doing numbers like Sudoku

They'll experience deja vu too
Fight and you'll never survive
Run and you'll never escape

I said hello Brooklyn, but baby you are so damn fine to me
And I remember the time, place and the weather from the day you said hi to me

Razor blades in my mouth walking 'round behaving
Or demented black hoodies and timberland'd
Always scheming you see the gleam on that niggas pendant
Hello Brooklyn, you bad influence
Look what you had me doing
But I ain't mad at you, look at my attitude it says my life's too real
Check out my ice grill baby I'm cold as ice

When the blocks come out I can wake up a small town
Finish off the block then I make my mall rounds
When them stares get exchanged then the 5th come out
The tough guy disappears then the bitch come out

Jay-Z,"Poor me, dad was gone, finally got my dad back
Liver bad, he wouldn't live long, they snatched my dad back
Guidance? I never had that, streets was my second home
Welcomed me with open arms provided a place to crash at
A place to study math at, matter of fact, I learned it all
Burned it all, this music is where I bury the ashes at
Had to get some chollah bread so you can holla back, and holla that
Flash back, not having much, not having that
My Jewish lawyer too enjoyed the fruit of letting my cash stack
And just in case a nigga gotta use his rat-tat-tat-tat
Own boss, own your masters, slaves
The mentality I carry with me to this very day
Fuck rich, let's get wealthy, who else gon feed we?
If I need it, I'mma get it however, God help me
And I don't need no hook for this shit

I'm so fa sho, it's no facade
“Stay outta trouble,” momma said as momma sighed
Her fear: her youngest son be a victim of homicide
But I gotta get you outta here momma, or I'mma die inside
And either way, you lose me momma so let loose of me
I got the rein our direction will soon change
To live and die in N.Y. in the hustle game
Hustle caine, hustle clothes, I hustle music
But hustle hard in any hustle that you pick
Skinny nigga, toothpick, but, but I do lift
Weight like I'm using roids
Rolls-Royce keep my movements, smooth while maneuvering
Through all the manure in the sewer that I grew up in
Choices, we make trying to escape
And I don't need no hook for this shit

This is not for commercial usage
Please don't categorize this as music
Please don't compare me to other rappers
Compare me to trappers, I'm more Frank Lucas than Ludacris
And Luda's my dude, I ain't trying to diss
Like Frank Lucas is cool, but I ain't trying to snitch
I'ma follow the rules no matter how much time I'mma get
I'mma live and die with the decisions that I'mma pick
So fuck DeHaven for caving, that's why we don't speak
Made men ain't supposed to make statements
End of the story, I followed the code, cracked the safe
Other niggas ain't in the game so they practice hate
Leave that boy Hov alone, why don't cha?

Defend me from those that rise up against me
Deliver me from the work of inequities
The savior from the blood of me

Look, mind state of a gangster from the 40's
Meet the vicious mind of Motown's Berry Gordy
Turn crack rocks into a chain of 40/40's
Sorry my jewelery so Gordy
Slid into the party with my new pair of Maury's
America meet the gangsta Shawn Corey
Hey young world wanna hear a story?
Close your eyes and you could pretend you're me
A cut from the cloth of the Kennedy's
Frank Sinatra having dinner with the Genovese
This is the genesis of a nemesis
Mother America's not witnessing
The Harlem renaissance birthed black businesses
This is the tale of lost innocence's as the incense burn 
And the turn tables turn and that AL Greens plays
I see my mother's Afro as momma taps her toes as she rolls her jays
And my poppa just left the house, in search of the killer of my uncle Ray
And she's trying to calm my nerves, as I observe this is just one day
And what tomorrow has in store we could never be sure so all we can do is
Pray

Because of your strength
While I walked upon the
For god is my defense

As I head towards my home room I observe the rooms though needles on the ground
I hear a car go vrooom drug dealer in the BM with the top down
As the girls start to giggle I ask why you laugh they say ""you too little""
One day you'll understand when you become a man 'bout things you have to get you
Fast forward freeze frame on my pistol
Fist full of dollars ignorance is so blissful
I didn't choose this life this life chose me
Around here is the shit that you just do
I just left school, the same BM is pulled over by the boys dressed blue
They had they guns drawn screaming just move
Unless there something else you suggest we can do
He made his way to the trunk, opened it like a huh
A treasure chest was removed
Cops said he'll be back next month
What we call corrupt he called paying dues
Now when the rules is blurred as they hears a what am I to do
But pray, pray the lord forgive me
Pray guys goodbye for what I'm about go through
Pray

Delivery me in thy righteousness
It cause me to escape and climb thy air until I am
Save me lord

Anyway there's oppression the drug profession
Flourishes like beverages refreshing
Sweet taste of sin everything I've seen made me everything I am
Bad drug dealer or I victim I beg
What came first moving chickens or the egg
This is why I be so fresh I'm trying to beat life
Because I can't cheat death
The truth is the shamelessness ain't stainless is that aim this is
You know who's game this is
Move coke like Pepsi it don't matter what the brand name is
I stand behind mine everything I do I'm a man behind mine
I'm not a angel I'm sure but every night 
Before I lay I drop my knees to the floor and I pray

The name shall endure forever
The name shall continue as long as the sun will
Men shall be blessed in him
All nations shall call him blessed
In your name I pray
For a blessing",Pray,2007

Let that bitch breath,

I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less.
What do I think of success
It sucks, too much stress
I guess I blew up quick, cause friends I grew up with
See me as a pre-me but I'm not and my nuts big
I don' know what the fuss is
My cribs illustrious
My rep is impeccable
I'm not to be fucked with

Shit
Let that bitch breath

I'm way to important to be talking about extortion'
Asking me for a portion is like asking for a coffin
Broad day light I off your on switch
Ya not too bright, goodnight, long kiss
Bye, bye my reply
Blah blah
Blast burning and pass burner the ta ta
Finish my breakfast, why?
I got an appetite for destruction and your a small fry
Now where was I?

Let that bitch breathe

I used to give a shit, now I don give a shit more
Truth be told, I had more fun when I was piss poor
I'm pissed off
This what success all about?
A bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths
All this stress, all I got is this big house
Couple cars I don bring half them shits out
All of this ace of spade I drank just to piss out
I mean I like the taste could of saved myself 6 hours
How many times can I go to Mr. Childs, towels no booth
Hold up, lemme move my bouwls
I'll shit on y'all niggas, OG tell these boys
(Ya ain't about to shit on my nigga)

I got watches I ain't seen in months
Apartment at the Trump; I only slept in once
Niggas said Hova was ova, such dummies
Even If I fell I'll land on a bunch of money
Ya ain't got nothing for me

Success, McLaren, women staring
My villain appearance sacred blood of a king
and my vein ain't spilling
Ghetto Othello, Sugar Hill Romello
Camaro driven, I climax from paper
and ask why is life worth living?
Is it to hunt for the shit that you want?
To receives great, but I lust giving
The best jewelers wanna make my things
I make Jacob shit on the range just to make me a chain
Niggas mention the one love
Came home with the paper in hand
They gotta brag about the FEDS young man
Old cribs I sold, y'all drive by like monuments
Google Earth Nas, I got flats in other continents
Worst enemies wanna be my best friends
Best friends wanna be enemies like thats whats in
But I don't give a fuck walk inside the lions den
Take everybody?s chips, about to cash them in
Up your catalog dog, mine's worth to much

So fly with no fear of the flight
So if y'all hear my plight
And if you think you can make it this far without fight
Couple mistakes here and there
Not always right
But I'm always real
That's how I sleep to night

And that may not be what you call perfect but
But its my life

So what if you flip a couple words
I could triple that in birds
Open your mind you see the circus in the sky
I'm Ringling brothers Barnum and Bailey with the pies
No matter how you slice it I'm your motherfucking guy
Just like a B-Boy with 360 waves
Do the same with the pot, still come back beige.
Whether writers are par, whether powder the jar
Whip it around, it still comes back hard.
So easily do I w-h-i-p
My repetition with wrists will bring you kilo biggers.
I got Creole C.O. bitches
For my niggas who slipped, became prisoners
Trees taped to the visitors
You already know what the business is
Unnecessary commissary, boy we live this shit
Niggas wanna bring the 80s back
It's okay with me, that's where they made me at
Except I don't write on the wall
I write my name in the history books,
Hustling in the hall (hustling in the hall)
Nah, I don't spin on my head
I spin work in the pots so I can spend my bread

If it wasn't for the crime that I was in
But I wouldn't be the guy whose rhymes it is that I'm in (that I'm in)
No pain, no profit, P I repeat if you show me where the pot is (pot is)
Cherry M3's with the top back (top back)
Red and green G's all on my hat
North beach leathers, matching Gucci sweater
Gucci sneaks on to keep my outfit together
Whatever, hundred for the diamond chain
Can't you tell that I came from the dope game
Blame Reagan for making me into a monster
Blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra
I ran contraband that they sponsored
Before this rhyming stuff we was in concert

And I'm getting it, I'm getting it
I ain't talking about it, I'm living it

Baked a lot of bread and kept it off the books
Rockstar, look, way before the bars my picture was getting took
Feds, they like wack rappers,
Tried as they may, couldn't get me on the hook
D.A. wanna indict me
Cause fish scales in my veins like a pisces
The pyrex pot, rolled up my sleeves
Turn one into two like a Siamese
Twin when it end, I'm a stand as a man
Never dying or admiring these
Last of a dying breed, so let the champagne pop

Y'all niggaz got me really confused out there
I make 'Big Pimpin'' or 'Give It To Me' one of those
Y'all hail me as the greatest writer of the 21st century
I make some thought provokin' shit y'all question whether he fallin' off
I'ma really confuse y'all on this one, follow

When them tops come down, chicks tops come down
Like when them shots come out, make cops come around
When them blocks come out I can wake up a small town
Finish off the block then I make my mall rounds

Stares get exchanged then the fifth come out
The tough guy disappear, then the bitch come out
""That's him"", I'm usually what they whisper 'bout
Either what chick he with or his chip amount

Cause I been doin' this since CHiPs was out
Watchin' Erik Estrada, baggin' up at the Ramada
Table full of powder, AC broke
'Bout to take another shower on my twenty-fifth hour

Spike Lee's everywhere, game on the flight
You might see me anywhere, day in the life
Only thing changed the tail number on the flight
I can touch down and take off the same night

I'm so bossy, bitch get off me
Trick get off me, you can't get shit off me
I'm so flossy, no 6's or Sprees
Laid back, Maybach's, don't even talk to me

They're all actors, lookin' at themselves in the mirror backwards
Can't even face themselves, don't fear no rappers
They're all weirdos, DeNiros in practice
So don't believe everythin' your earlobe captures, it's mostly backwards

Unless it happens to be as accurate as me
And everythin' said in song you happen to see
Then actually, believe half of what you see
None of what you hear, even if it's spat by me

And with that said, I will kill niggaz dead
Cut niggaz short, give you wheels for legs
I'm a K I double L E are, see y'all in hell
Shoot niggaz straight through the E.R.

Whoa, this ain't B.R., no
This S.C. CEO, the next Lyor, no
The next leader of the whole free world
And the first thing I'ma do is free Sigel, go

Take off the cuffs, unlock the gate
It's that ignorant nigga that you love to hate
The oh-seven Ice Cube, B. Sig' so rude
Tell a trick get these nuts, eat dick like food

Now see if I care if this verse get aired
Even if you mute it, the curse is there, yeah
I'm so raunchy, bitch get off me
Keep my flea collar on, you lil' ticks get off me

I missed the part when it stopped bein 'bout Imus
What do my lyrics got to do with this shit
'Scarface' the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me
So that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me

Is worse than these celebrataunts showin' they kittin', you kiddin'?

Right sometimes till the chicks noodles
I got screws loose
I pull words out the air like blue tooth
I'm a sandwich short of a picnic
Ignorant thoughts come across
You'd sworn that I written this
But I didn't, so maybe
It's good to be crazy
Isn't it, baby?

I wrote your name on my wall three thousand times
Last night you were on my mind
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me
That's what you...

Then, one by one I went down the line just repeating it
'Cause it makes me smile
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me

Some say that it's
Just strange to act
That way
But they don't understand

No, they don't get it
You're so magnetic
Though it's pathetic
To them I simply turn and say...

Jay-Z,"It's funny how money change a situation
Miscommunication leads to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you on every station
Some wan' play young lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from bricks to kingston
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run
Now understand ""l-boogie's"" non-violent
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun
Can't take a threat to mi new born son
L's been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you want to ball over separation
Tarnish my image in your conversation
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?
You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

Now, now how come your talk turn cold?
Gain the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
Now you all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless, now I'm more hopeful
Every man want to act like he's exempt
Need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always want to play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment
I know you don't want to hear my opinion
But there come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change then the rain soon come
See you might win some, but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done?  it's so silly how come?
You just lost one

Now don't you understand man universal law?
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard!
You can't hold god's people back that long
The chain of shatan wasn't made that strong
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now, some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely you'll see what you've become
Cause you might win some but you just lost one!

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done, it's so silly how come?

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done, it's so silly how come?

You just lost one

Jay-Z,"And Ne-yo is like Young Michael, I'm Quincy hoe
Now hear the flow that broke the Da Vinci Code
I'm psycho, everything I wrote go together, so nice
Like a wedding make you wanna throw rice

I'm schitzo, cuckoo clock don't tick so
Write sometimes 'til the chicks noodles
I got screws loose
I pull words out the air like blue tooth

I'm a sandwich short of a picnic
Ignorant thoughts come across
You've sworn that I written this but I didn't
So maybe it's good to be crazy
Isn't it, baby?

I wrote your name on my wall
3000 times last night
You were on my mind
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me
That's what you

Then one by one I went down the line
Just repeating it
'Cause it makes me smile
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me
That's what you

Some say that it's just strange
To act that way
But they don't understand
No, they don't get it
You're so magnetic, though it's pathetic
To them I simply turn and say

Just call me crazy
Insane, deranged
It don't matter to me
Call it what you want to, I don't care
And it doesn't make a difference
Long as she's there

Just call me crazy
Lovin' you is crazy
Crazy is what I'll be
Ohh, crazy, ohh crazy, ohh
Just call me crazy

Lately it seems
Like every song I write is about you
Ohh, I love your style
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me
That's what you do

And it just don't make no sense
How my swagger is crooked
If you ain't by my side
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me
That's what you do

Just call me crazy
Insane, deranged
It don't matter to me
Call it what you want to, I don't care
And it doesn't make a difference
Long as she's there

Just call me crazy
Lovin' you is crazy
Crazy is what I'll be
Ohh, crazy, ohh crazy, ohh
Just call me crazy

I talk to your picture
Ohh, write your name in the mirror
Right after I love you down
I need you so much
Can't get enough

Just call me crazy
Insane, deranged
It don't matter to me
Call it what you want to, I don't care
And it doesn't make a difference
Long as she's there

Just call me crazy
Lovin' you is crazy
Crazy is what I'll be
Ohh, crazy, ohh crazy, ohh

Jay-Z,"Yeah, what you critics said would never happen
We dedicate this album to anybody people said couldn't make it
To the fans that held us down 'til everybody came around
Welcome, it's here!

Last summer we took threes across the board
But by fall, we were a cover story, ""Now in stores""
Make us poster boys for your scene
But we are not making an acceptance speech
I found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes
Every dot com's refreshing for a journal update

So long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch and all the poets come to life
Fix me in forty-five
So long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch and all the poets come to life
Fix me in forty-five

I can take your problems away with a nod and a wave...
Of my hand, 'cause that's just the kind of boy that I am
The only thing I haven't done yet is die
And it's me and my plus one at the afterlife
Crowds are won and lost and won again
But our hearts beat for the diehards

So long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch and all the poets come to life
Fix me in forty-five
So long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch and all the poets come to life
Fix me in forty-five

Long live the car crash hearts
(Long live the car crash hearts)
Long live the car crash hearts
(Long live the car crash hearts)

Long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch and all the poets come to life
Fix me in forty-five

Young! F-O-B
Let's go",Thriller,2007
Jay-Z,"Young! For life
Once again it's the life, yes
(I don't know why, I, get so high on)
It's intoxicatin' man, y'all don't know why you do what you do
(Get so high on, get so high - high off the life)

The allure of breakin' the law
Is always too much for me to ever ignore
I gotta thing for them big body Benzes, it dulls my senses
In love with a V-Dub engine
Man I'm high off life, fuck it I'm wasted
Bey Venay kicks, or them Marvin Kaye wrists
My women friend get tennis bracelets
Trips to Venice, get they winters replaced with
The sun, it ain't even fun no more I'm jaded
Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it
I put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without sayin' a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy
Man my brother hustled so, naturally
Up next is me, but what perplexes me
Shit I know how this movie ends, still I play
The starrin' role in ""Hovito's Way""

It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shavin' coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doin' the most, oh no!
But every time I felt that was that, it called me right back
It called me right back, man it called me right back - oh no!

I'm like a Russian mobster, drinkin' distilled vodka
'Til I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real
Pillow-top him like a toupee
Mix the water, with the soda
Turn the pot up make a souffle
All of y'all can get it like group-ays in your 2-way
I'm livin' proof that crime do pay
Say hooray to the bad guy, and all the broads
Puttin' cars in they name for the stars of the game
Puttin' 'caine in they bras and their tomorrows on the train
All in the name of love
Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
Over the house to take back, everything that they claimed
Or even the worst pain is the distress
Learnin' you're the mistress only after that love gets slain
And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
Now it gets tough to ever love a-gain
But the allure of the game, keeps callin' your name
To all the Laura's of the world, I feel your pain
To all the Christie's in every cities and Tiffany Lanes
We all hustlers, in love with the same thang

It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shavin' coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
Cause I be doin' the most, oh no!
But every time I felt that was that, it called me right back
It called me right back, man it called me right back - oh no!

I never felt more alive than ridin' shotgun
In Cline's green 5 until the cops pulled guns
And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need
What the game did to my pulse, with no results
And you can treat your nose and still won't come close
The game is a light bulb with eleventy-million volts
And I'm just a mark, addicted to the floss
And doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
By any means necessary, whatever the cost
Even if it means lives is lost
And I can't explain why, I just love to get high
Drink life, smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice
I'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times
I may not even be alive
How mean James Dean couldn't escape the allure
Dyin' young, leavin' a good lookin' corpse

It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shavin' coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doin' the most, oh no!
But every time I felt that was that, it called me right back
It called me right back, man it called me right back - oh no!

Once again it's the life
I said it's the life
Once again it's the life, oh no!
(I don't why I) why I (get so high on)
Get so (get so high on) uh-huh

They better let it go because n***** already know
That I got that thing wit me and it ain't just to let it go
Tell ya mama bet it go tell I hit n***** say yo
They ain't nobody, f*** 'em I'm thinkin' I'm finally bust 'em (wait)
Look up and see police is lookin' at me
I tell C he tell Doug they tell KT
We proceed to surround 'em and call him squirrel meat
Pick the perfect spot to make sure that the girls see
What you walkin' off do the drinkin' say what?
What you think then call and see nothin' but bottle
Remy Martin to the noggin' better bust it wide open
Ya b**** standin' here hollerin' while you lyin' in on the floor (s***)
Why you feelin' sorry for him he asked for it
Listen y'all here come the moral of the story

[Chorus]

Rap music is sudden ain't it the way these pictures is painted
You swear these n***** is dangerous the gangsta s*** they sayin'
Lock 'em up in the booth with a half a ounce of that cannabis
Sittin' back and watch the outlandish s*** they betrayin' (but)
Soon as you see em they freeze up like in museums
Them statues you like is that the dude who said he was gonna pop
N***** get runnin' before you finish your sentence
And then they back to riffin' when they off in a safe distance
You like u was just here you disappeared like magicians in thin air
I'm like damn n**** at least keep it consistent
I hear you debatin' me lately, I've been doin' my best to stay hater-free
Still watch what you say to me
Sooner or later I'll take you up on your offer and put you all in your place like I'm replacing your father
You talkin' to the author, the architect of the blueprint
My DNA in your music mothaf***** are you stupid

[Chorus]

'Cause I ain't never been a sucka been gangsta my whole life
So a n**** disrespect me and its on on sight
I hear what you say in your songs some of it I don't like
Heat it up I feel tried I see you we gon' fight
Be a man say my name if you talkin' to me
You never said well I figured you ain't talkin' to me
Find out you is at the awards well I'll call you out in the street
I swear I'll beat your f***in' a** like it ought to be beat!
See all that whisperin' is lame I ain't one for the game
If I say f*** you n**** f*** you simple and plain
I say no problem it no problem pimp you do the same
You can just swallow your pride 'cause you know I'm off the chain
Try to refrain from bein' violent but you come out your face
I got my lawyer paid up ready to catch me a case
When I feel you disrespected me I'm a get me a case
But all this s*** can be avoided one on one

Jay-Z,"I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keeps the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep them on a leash though
I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me

Come harder; this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself; trust me, you need me
This ain't no shoulder with a chip or an ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?

You need a real woman in your life (that's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly (that's a good look)

I'm talking spa bags and fly pads and rooms at the Bloomberg
And rumors you on the verge of a new marriage
'Cause that rock on your finger's like a tumor
You can't fit your hand in your new purse
It's humorous to me; they watchin' and we just yachtin'

And you already is a star

Then your dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me

Good boy leathers, hood boys'll blast you

And love hip hop, the shit that bring money outta ziplocs
Protect your dome, I'm warning you, what harm I do to the kid
I have you on the floor with ya armor loose
Break the raw down and sign truces
Then switch the next muthafuckin' date, fuck all excuses
When you see me it's real, I'm just a natural born hustler

Hopped out to get a dutch, but he left with his wig splitten
We from New York, my city never sleeps (No)
We runnin' with a hundred heats
When beef pop off, we ain't the one to speak
Dressed in all black, driving six feet hurses
With sixteen niggaz, dropping sixteen verses
Big faces, bolgin' outta big green purses
Stuck ya man for his vegi's and his lame ass circus

This is how we gon' do it
I mean I making grass grow baby, ya know
Seeds become plants
Boys become men
Want we gon' do

Wrapped around our girls like pashminas
Whats my demeanor
The grass is always greener on the other side
To think of I cant give her a ring up
I couldn't give a fuck
I could I give a finger
Let alone half baths and closets
So claustrophobic if there were close objects
Now its sort of like two door garages
Its like two broads minagin'
Your the best mama!

Is there any chance
That you remember me being any more than just a horrible man
And would you consider
Pullin' this trigger
And taking a second shot at romance
Oh Babe,
I want the days when you were my girl
And I was your man,
Know I took you for granted,
But it wasn't until now I see how much I miss you
Girl I'm sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool, yeah
But for once, here goes the truth

I can't be fake I can't be phonie
Acting all hard thats the niggas thats lonely
I tried to flex but I confess that when you left you took the very best thing
The best things that ever happened to me
You took my best thing,
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing that I ever seen
You took the, the best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress cause when you left you took the very best

Remember Mimi or Vita, remember Isha or Eva
I ain't got em no more, hey yes
Niomi or Jenny, the same outcome is chillin'
Girl, I let em all go
No more trickin' and kissin' miscellaneous chicks
Acting like a jerk, woman I been to church
And I talked to the bishop and he wanted me to share this with ya
How much I miss you

I'm so sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once here goes the truth

I can't be fake I can't be phonie
Acting all hard thats the niggas thats lonely
I tried to flex but I confess that when you left you took the very best thing
The best things that ever happened to me
You took my best thing,
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing that I ever seen
You took the, the best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress cause when you left you took the very best

Mama tried t o told me
Hovie Hov better slow it down
You gon' lose your best thing
If you keep gettin' round
Like PAC needed pot
When you old to hold you down
Ma forever young was forever numb
Sorry states are sorry done
Your million and all of them
All of em was funny time
It wasn't you it was him
School me once school me twice

Call that bitch your bodyguard? Yeah, that's my bodyguard

What's whiter than a napkin, harder than a dinner plate
If you want it come and get it, you know I stay super straight
Ran up in my spots and now I'm workin' Out the Super 8
Know you niggas hungry, come and get a super plate
Y'all sing happy birthday, yeah I got that super cake

Half bag, top back,
Ain't nothin' but a young thug
HKs, AK's, I need to join a gun club
Big wheels, big straps,
You know I like it super sized
Passenger's a red-bone,
Her Weave look like some curly fries
Inside fish sticks, outside tartar sauce
Pocket full of celery,
Imagine what she tellin' me
Blowin' on asparagus,
The realest shit I ever smoked
Ridin' to that Trap or Die,
The realest shit I ever wrote
They know I got that broccoli,
So I keep that glock on me
Don't get caught without one,
Comin' from where I'm from
Call me Jeezy Hamilton,
Flyin' down Campbellton
So fresh, so clean,
On my way to Charlene

I feel like there's still bitches that owe me sex
I feel like this but niggas don't know the stress
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
I got the money and the fame and that don't mean shit
I got the Jesus on a chain, man that don't mean shit
Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace
Sure I need just at least one of Russell's nieces on
I let my nightmares go I put on,
Everybody that I knew from the go
I know hoes that was frontin' when they knew he was broke
They say damn, Yeezy Yeezy, you don't know us no more
You got that big fame homie, and you just changed on me
You can ask big homie, man the top so lonely
I ain't lyin', so lonely I ain't lyin'

Billionaire, yayo
(J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League)

57, yes, yes, good for a D-Boy
Hand my MAC-11 to the engineer to record
Got the baddest women in the world for me to feed on
Double deck yacht, docked Boss, blowin' weed up
Revenue incredible, it put me on a pedestal
Columbia to Mexico, I figured was a better route
Look at me, a model now, models and them bottles 'round
A Blood holla ""Ballin'"" but the boys in blue, they shot 'em down
Gang-affiliated, colors prosecutors painted
'Cause the niggas I employed name synonymous with mayhem
Instrumentals that are mental, Maybach kind of mental
400 off the lot, on the block is monumental (Boss)
Some things your money can't buy
Like Heaven in the sky, even a better ride
In the rear, so many instruments I hear
Tucked behind curtain, no sign to fear
I'm higher than a Lear, this Maybach music
Designer shit I wear, make hoes lose it (Boss)
Close your eyes and inhale the smoke
It's Maybach music, the realest shit I wrote, nigga
Buy an ounce, take a toke
Of this Maybach music, the realest shit I wrote

It's Young
Fuck it then

Black Maybach, white seats, black pipin'
Remind me of Paul McCartney and Mike fightin'
You know, ""The Girl Is Mine""
Life's a bitch, so the whole world is mine
The six-deuce long, the curtains are drawn
Perfectly like a Picasso, Rembrandts and Rothkos
I'm a major player, 40/40's in Vegas at the Palazzo
They said it was not so
Certain things your money can't buy
Like being this fly, 'til then, I'm just gon' ride
I'm like G-Rap with better transportation
On the road to the riches, reach my final destination
In the Lear, closer to Aaliyah, say a prayer
Hope I get to see her when I disappear from here, baby, yeah
But I don't see the endin' through these millionaire lenses
Just the two M's on the emblem
The partition roof, translucent and humidor
Refrigerators, where Ace of Spades and two I store
True story, my closet is like two stories
Straight to the happy endin', 'cause I don't do stories
Shawn Corey, real rap
The Maybach is bananas, peel back

You feel that? Young, c'mon

Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach
8-track episodes, been doin' this since way back
Since way back, since way back
8-track episodes, been doin' this since way back

Boss, can't be stopped now
I got too much cake

They pinchin' pennies, while I'm musclin' for mills
And that muscle be that muzzle, when I stuff it in your grill
Stuffed shells, thanks to crack, I crack crab and lobsters
Not all mobsters imposters, gotcha
Boy, I got a eagle view, standin' on my balcony
Can only stay a week or two, so many people out for me
I bulletproofed my Maybach, got a killer's intuition
Holdin' on that MAC-11, Makaveli premonition
Waitin' on my Suge Knight, one nation under God
Since I chose a thug's life, guess I gotta play my part
Never will I die, my name symbolized
The hustle for young killers coming from the other side
Some things your money can't buy
Like Heaven in the sky, even a better ride
I'm large, my black car, menagin' black broads
Massage for frauds, I'm livin' large, my fat rocks

She got a ass that'll swallow up a g-string
And up top, uh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting, off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that you do bring
I'm just trying to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to drop some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
What's that 'Ye? Baby, these heels
Is that a may? What?
Baby, these wheels

You feelin' like you runnin', huh? Now you know how we feel, (What's up)

I seen Mase do it, I seen Ye do it
X came through, caught lighter fluid
Still I came through it; clap for him!
But I’m the blueprint, I’m like the map for 'em
I dropped another classic, made Puff pass it
Nobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it
Wayne scorchin', I'll applaud him
If he keep going, pass the torch to him
50 came through like hurricanes do
I thought I'd finish his ass at Summer Jam too
I had the Illmatic on bootleg
The shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead
Wayne did ""A Milli"", 50 did a milli
Ye too, but what Em did was silly
The white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him
His flow on ""Renegade,"" fucking awesome; applaud him!

Snoop dogged it, Nelly came down
The Face Mob kept it ghetto for the H-town
Luda moved digits after he moved bitches
Drake’s up next, see what he do with it
Rule had a run, couple movie parts
T.I. literally wanted to shoot up the charts
What up, Jeezy? What it do?
Y’all remind me of us in early '92
Outkast landed, 3 thou was ill
Like a male version of Lauryn Hill
Mobb Deep shook it, but Prodigy took it
A lil' too far, can’t fuck with Brooklyn
Wu-Tang gang-banged it, Meth ate
Rae took on the date with the Purple Tape
Passed on to Ason and then Ghostface
They had a hell of a run,standing ovate, ayyy

Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em
Everyday a star is born
Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em

Can’t you see just how long my run?
My reign, Lulu's son-shine
Been a star since I was duckin' one time
One time, give it up for him
December 4th, a star was born
Clap for him! He went from moving that corner
To this corner office, it's so enormous
Hey, Pres Carter
Watch them get they Monica on all day
Hey, got so many different monikers but only one Jay
They come, they go, some real, some faux
Some friends, some hoes
But, no, I goes nowhere, this Hov

And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Just to make it in these Broadway lights?
Now I'm shining in the broad day light, go figure
A slow transition from a little broke nigga from the Ville
Got a deal, a real life saver
Dreams of being behind the wheel, like Jada
I chill now, cop a little ice later
Cole, you got the glow like a lil' lightsaber
So clap for him! Then applaud Hov, he gave him a platform
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him
No sir, the flow's cold as the shoulders
Of gold digging hoes when a broke nigga approaches
Told you I’m focused, man
I’ll let you motherfuckers soak it in and clap for 'em!

For comin' out this evening

Thank you, thank you, thank you
You're far too kind
Hold you're applause
This is your song not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you
Please hold your applause
For I just applied logic keys 
Keys open doors

Now I'm balcony, Opera, Black Tux, Binocula
Black luxe, Stop it I shouldn't be so popular
Name keep poppin' up face keep poppin' up
On the tube I'm just watchin' Pacquaio box 'em up
How would I know H-B-O would get a shot of us
Sitting so close that we almost got snot on us
Please don't bow in my presence 
How am I a legend?
I just got ten number one albums 
Maybe now eleven
More hits than a 'Now!' eleven
That is no reason to treat me like I'm somehow from outta heaven
Heaven knows that I've made my mistakes
That God, what a guy as I say my grace
Who would of thought by making birds migrate
For the winter I be fly all summer Might I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, thank you, thank you you're far too kind
Hold your applause this is your song not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you you're far too kind
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors I'll handle mines

Hovi Baby,
We are really high, really high tonight
We tip the waiter a hundred dollars
To keep the ice cold, alright?
We the last guys to keep the wise guys code alive
If I can't live by my word then I'd much rather die
No no don't thank me, this is just how my suit is stitched
I'm cut from a different cloth, I'm just who the shoe fits
For the ""Color Of Money"" like a Tom Cruise flick
'Cept I put eight-balls in corners without using pool sticks
Beautiful music when champagne flutes click (eh)
Beautiful women sippin' through rouge lips (eh)
Dangers approaches we're like wait who's this?
Let us save you some trouble son
What size suit you is?
This way after the rugger shoots through a few clips
You can lay in your casket just as you is
We appreciate the target practices
We'll be sure to send flower baskets kid

[Chorus]

I was gonna kill a couple rappers
But they did it to themselves
I was goin' do it with the flow
But they did it with their sales
I was goin' nine eleven 'em, but they didn't need the help
And they did a good job them boys is talented as hell
Cause not only did they brick they put a building up as well
They ran a plane into that building and when that building fell
Ran to the crash site with no masks and inhaled
Toxins deep inside their lungs until both of them was filled
Blew a cloud out like a L into a jar then took a smell
Cause they heard that second hand smoke kills
N****s thought they was ill found out they was, eww
And it's like you knew exactly how I wanted you to feel

[Chorus]

Really really high, really high tonight

What we talking about real s*** or we talking about rhymes?
We talking about millions or you just talking about mine,
What we talking about?
Cause I ain't got time for what people be talking about all the time,
What we talking about fiction or we talking about fact,
We talking about fiction
Hold up, pardon my back

I'm talking about life (life, life)
And all I hear is ""oh yeah he keeps talking 'bout crack"",
I ain't talking about profit, I'm talking about pain,
I'm talking about despair, I m talking about shame,
Talking about gossip, I ain't talking bout Game,
I ain't talking about Jimmy, I ain't talking bout Dame!

I'm talking about real s***, dem people playin',
What is you talking bout, I dunno what y'all sayin',
People keep talking about ""Hov take it back""!
I'm doing better than before why would I do that?

Ain't nothing cool about carrying a strap, 
About worrying ya moms, and burying ya best cat, 
Talking about revenge while you carrying his casket, 
All teary eyed bout to take it to a mattress.

Talking about music I ain't talking about rap,
I'm talking about whose hot I ain't talking about that!
The conversation has changed lets yap about that,
I don't run rap no more I run the map

[Chorus]
They talk, we live, 
We see what they say, they say, they say
They talk, we did, 
Who cares what they say, they say, they say

Yeah, still they can't focus on them
They be talking bout me,
Talkin' bout what I wear,
Talkin' bout where I be, yeah
Check out my hair 
These ain't curls these is peas
Peasey head still get paid 
I'm combin' through G's please
We ain't focused on naps
Cause I don't run rap no more I run the map
A small part of the reason the President is black
I told him I got him when he hit me on the jack
Talkin' bout progress I ain't lookin back
You know I run track try not to get lapped
People keep talkin' bout Hov left em flat
Try to re-write history lets talk about facts
Dame made millions even Jaz made some scraps
He could've made more but he didn't sign his contract
As far as street guys we was dealin' crack
That's just how the game goes I don't owe nobody jack
Grown men want me to sit em on my lap
But I don't have a beard and Santa Claus ain't black
I repeat, you can't sit on my lap
I don't have a beard now get off my sack
Scream at me

And now that that's that Lets talk about the future
We have just seen the dream as predicted by Martin Luther
And you could choose ta sit in front of your computa
Posin' with guns shootin' YouTube up
Or you could come with me to the White House get your suit up
You stuck on being hardcore I chuck the deuce up

Let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit
Life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young

So we live a life like a video
When the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happened to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today
'Cause there is no tomorrow
Just some picture perfect day
To last a whole lifetime
And it never ends
'Cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So lets just stay in the moment, smoke some weed
Drink some wine,
Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut
I'll be fine
I'm forever young

Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?

Fear not when, fear not why
Fear not much while were alive
Life is for living not living up tight
See ya somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye
So not for legends, I'm forever young
My name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves
Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barber shops, young slung, hung here
Shorty, the nigga from here
With a little ambition just what we can become here
And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears
Younger kid, younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?

Hopping out of Porsche's
Popping up on Forbes lists

Hold up
Niggas thought I lost it
They be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit
They nauseous
Hold up
I'll be here forever
You know, I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't waiting for closure, I will never forfeit

I'm painting you a portrait of young

Victory (Lighters up) is finally ours

History so long so long
So long, so long

In search of victory she keeps eluding me
If only we could be together momentarily
We can make love and make history
Why won't you visit me? Until she visit me
I'll be stuck with her sister her name is defeat
She gives me agony, so much agony
She brings me so much pain so much misery
Like missing your last shot and falling to your knees
As the crowd screams for the other team
I practice so hard for this moment victory don't leave
I know what this means I'm stuck in this routine
Whole new different day same old thing
All I got is dreams nobody else can see
Nobody else believes, nobody else but me
Where are you victory? I need you desperately

While victory wasn't watching took chances repeatedly
As a teenage boy before acne before I got Proactiv I couldn't face she
I just threw on my hoodie and headed to the street
That's where I met success we'd live together shortly
Now success is like lust she's good to the touch
She's good for the moment but she's never enough
Everybody's had her she's nothing like V
But success is all I got unfortunately
But I'm burning down the block hoppin' in and out of V
But something tells me that there's much more to see
Before I get killed because I can't get robbed
So before me success and death menage
I gotta get lost I gotta find V
We gotta be together to make history

And the battle's finally won

Now victory is mine it tastes so sweet
She's my trophy wife you're coming with me
We'll have a baby who stutters repeatedly
We'll name him History he'll repeat after me
He's my legacy son of my hard work
Future of my past he'll explain who I be
Rank me amongst the greats either 1 2 or 3
If I ain't number one then I failed you victory
Ain't in it for the fame that dies within weeks
Ain't in it for the money can't take it when you leave
I wanna be remembered long after you grieve
Long after I'm gone long after I breathe
I leave all I am in the hands of history
That's my last will and testimony
This is much more than a song it's a baby shower
I've been waiting for this hour history you ours

At the same time rejuvenate the game
It's for my ol'dawg niggas that's used to 'caine

Not what B-dawg said, I respect the game
G-D's, vice lords, crips the same
And I know you're 'bout to say this off the chain
Tell 'em fake trappin' ass niggas stay out my lane

See I ain't dead or in jail, I can't complain
And when these fake niggas gone, I shall remain
And if you just tunin' in, let me explain
You know I keep that 47 who ?

These niggas way too far, I played the game
And if you listen hard enough I say some things
And when that sack got low, I shave them things
And put 'em right back together, I made them things

I rap and I'm real, I'm one of the few here

Clear of the real shit we doin' over here
When my nigga get home, I'm gonna send him a Lear
For all the time he been down, get him right up in the air

With a couple of broads get him right up in the air
Mile high club get him right up in there
Send my nigga some gear like he never missed a year
By the time you hear this song, he'll be standing right here

I'll probably never see jail

That's why they feel me in the favelas in Brazil
And water-house 'cause real recognize real

Call me make a lil' somethin' out of nothin'
Anywhere you go, we're the topic of discussion
Damn, that's gotta be disgustin'

Err, shit make me wanna throw up
It's big boy music, it should make me wanna grow up
Flows like selvage, it just make me wanna pour up
And is it just me or this makes you wanna roll up

A big fat one, then unpack one
Then unwrap one, peel back one
They use to call me Jizzle when they step in the middle
And you can tell the color when it's damp in the middle

Whats up!

Put your sacks in the air if you represent your click
Money in the air if you ever hear the lick, baby

Jay-Z,"Yeah three in the morning on the Westside highway, top down baby,
Fuck y'all
The motivation for me is them telling me what I could not be,
Oh well

This a special dedication, (thank y'all)
I wanna thank you for the fuel,
No really thank you

(y'all better hear this shit)
I felt so inspired by what my teacher said,
Said I'd either be dead or be a reefer head,
Now sure if that's how adults should speak to kids,
Especially when the only thing I did was speak in class,
I teach his ass,
Even betters what my uncle did,

I pop my demo tape in, start to beat my head,
Peaked out my eye, see if he was beating his,
He might as well say beat it kid, he's on the list,
Its like I'm searching for kicks like a sneaker head,
He goin' keep pushing me until I reach the ledge,
And when I reach the ledge I'll tell em all to eat a dick,
Take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread,
Spread spread spread

The motivation for me is them telling me what I could not be,
Oh well, (hey, hey)
I'm so ambitious, (hey)
I might hit two sisters,
Hey I'm on a mission
No matter what the conditions,
Forget personal issues
When you been what I been through,
Hey if you believe it,
Then you could conceive it

yeah yeah yeah

I had to lace up my boots even harder,
Father is too far away to father,
Further-more are the kids either smoke reefer,
Or either move white, there's few writers in my cipher,
So they made lighter, my type a dreams seem dumb
They said wise up, how many guys a
you see making it from here,
The world don't like us,
is that not clear, alright, but
I'm different, I can't base what I'm gonna be off a what everybody isn't,
They don't listen,
just whispering behind my back,
No vision, lack of ambition,
So wack

The motivation for me is them telling me what I could not be,
Oh well, (hey, hey)
I'm so ambitious, (hey)
I might hit two sisters,
Hey I'm on a mission
No matter what the conditions,
Forget personal issues
When you been what I been through,
Hey if you believe it,
Then you could conceive it

Had a couple of meetings no offers yet,
Maybe I ain't good enough for these offices,
Back to the drawing board ducking officers,
It's all good cause the streets is A and R'in this,
So with or without any of y'all involvement,
We coming for all of this, respect my conglomerate,
I went from pauper to the President,
Cause every deal I ever made set precedent,
Niggas probably thought I'd fall without old buddy,
Oh buddy, what I do is make more money,
Dear teacher, your probably somewhere near a speaker,
I'm balling outta control, can you hear my sneakers,
Fuck y'all

The motivation for me is them telling me what I could not be,
Oh well, (hey, hey)
I'm so ambitious, (hey)
I might hit two sisters,
Hey I'm on a mission
No matter what the conditions,

My dollars was down, she left me for some Euro's,
Took my whole flavor, I call her coke zero,
We were Co-M-V-P's like Kobe and Shaq,
Left me for the Heat,
We were winning back to back,
Said I partied too much, shawty got fed up,
Shawty got Britney shaved her whole head up,
We used to make out, kissing each others face off,
Fell for the ponzi scheme, damn shawty just Made-off.

But you don't want no commitment, huh? (Uh-uh!)
Why not? You should be coming home with me
Sitting in this lap with the luxury
Now you can, come in the morning while waking up (Yeah!)
Acting like you behave and stuff (Uh-huh!)
You should be coming home with me
Sitting in this lap with the luxury, now check it

Walk in Manolo Blahniks cause my condo with elevators in 'em
She wanna wrinkle my linens
So I sprinkle her with gin and then we begin sinning, uhh
Blasphemy, oh my God, we be sinning
She keeps scratching me like she tiger in 'em
This is exactly, why I had to pin her
To the bed like a wrestler, her to press on her, uhh
Her man kept paging, stressing her
So I told her what to say just in case he question her
(Situations, will arise, but you gotta be smart about it)
No matter what you do, don't talk about us
Don't give him no info, he'll be lost without it
Just keep your mouth shut, we could do this again
Bring a friend!

Guess who's back in my motherf***ing house
Half black, half white chick, I call her Minnie Mouse
We always hook up when we out
We do what we like to do and then we out

Your boy Young Hov' catching feelings
And it's messing up my dealings cause mami's not willing
To leave her boyfriend, she call me her toy-friend
Said, ""We was just supposed to hook up and have a gla**""
She called me her emergency dick-in-the-gla**
I had to laugh for a second
Had to check myself, get my macking back in perspective
I slack for a second but I'm back, no question

You ready B? Let's go get 'em

Look for me, Young B
Cruisin' down the westside highway
Doing what we like to do our way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel
It's true to the heart

She rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during 'Sex and the City'
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)

The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
Now they 'bout nothin' if ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect, nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid

I keep you workin' at Hermes, Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend

Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)

Talk to 'em B, if I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if it's somebody was me
Yeah, break it down for 'em
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could've been
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us

And I promise I'll give my life
All of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
All of my trust if you was my boyfriend

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend

She ain't a politician honeys a politician
My president is black Rolls golden charms
Twenty two inch rims like Hulk Hogan's arms
When thousands of people is riled up to see you
That can arouse ya ego you got mouths to feed so
Gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from
Cuz at the top will be the same place you hang from
No matter how big you can ever be
For whatever fee or publicity never lose your integrity

Mets-moi la radio un peu plus fort
Et n'aie pas peur, j'vais pas aller dans le décor

Soudain, juste avant Monte-Carlo
C'est ça, c'est ça le manque de pot
V'là que la Jaguar fait une embardée
Et droit devant la v'là qui pique dans le fossé

Et pendant que tous deux agonisaient
La radio, la radio a continué d'y gueuler

Niggas feel they selves
And then Watch The Throne drop
Niggas kill they selves
What niggas gon' do Hov?
This a new crack on a new stove
I'm in the two-door, true that
Niggas tellin' me ""You back"" (you back)
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?
And if life a bitch suck my dick huh?
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
By the way nigga, you should fuckin' quit, nigga
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli I did it, jokes on you mothafucker and I get it
No paper hoe, but you can have some more of me
Or-gy, or are we, speakin' metaphorically
Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like Pam nigga
Goin' HAM nigga, me and Jigga
And a nigga still young, wanna have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
Had a few white girls, asses flat a shit
But the head so good, damn a nigga glad he hit
Got 'em jumpin' out the building
Watch out below, a million out the door

I'm about to go HAM
Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am
I'm about to go HAM
Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am

Fuck y'all mad at me for?
Y'all don't even know what I've been through
I play chicken with a Mack truck
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been moved
I swam waters with great whites
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been chewed
I hustle with vultures late nights
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been food
Fuck wrong with these dudes
Try to walk around in these shoes
See the shit I saw growing up
And maybe you can take a peek at these boo's
Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily like
These rappers rap about all the shit that I do really
I'm like really half a billi nigga
Really you got baby money
Keep it real with niggas
Niggas ain't got my lady money
Watch the Throne don't step on our road
Bad enough we let you step on our globe
When my nephew died, daddy dead
Niggas took the price on my uncles head
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
So I feel like I would like to know my uncles bread
Bow down, brother pay homage
Don't spill hate all on my garments
Commes Des Garcon, fuck your fresh
Head shots nigga fuck your vests
Fuck the pig, no pork on my fork
Peace God 'cause you know a nigga just went Ham

Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM
Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM",H.A.M.,2010

""Fellow Americans, it is with the utmost pride and sincerity
That I present this recording, as a living testament and recollection
Of history in the making during our generation.""

Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Hov' (oh) H-to-the-O-V
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z
I guess even back then you can call me
CEO of the R-O-C, Hov'
Fresh out the frying pan into the fire
I be the, music biz number one supplier
Flier than a piece of paper bearing my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearing my chain, that's right
Hov' (oh) not D.O.C.
But similar to them letters, ""No One Can Do it Better""
I check cheddar like a food inspector
My homey Strict told me, ""Dude finish your breakfast""
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude
With the Lexus, fast-forward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
Shoot at you actors like movie directors
This ain't a movie dog (oh shit)

""Now before I finish, let me just say
I did not come here to show out, did not come here to impress you
Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm gone!
And I don't care what you think about me, but just remember,
When it hits the fan brother, whether it's next year, ten years,
Twenty years from now, you're gonna be able to say
That these brothers lied to you Jack!""

Ting ain't lie
I done came through the block in everything that's fly
I'm like, Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga I get mine, by any means on whenever there's a drought
Get your umbrellas out because, that's when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game
I just rolled the dice, trying to get some change
And I do it twice, ain't no sense in me
Lying as if, I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains
Hope you don't think users are the only abusers
Niggas getting high within the game
If you do then, how would you explain?
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins
I got a hustler spirit, nigga period
Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag yo, I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go, you are what you are player
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone
Either love me, or leave me alone

Act like you been in the drop top
On the open road before

When I come in the party with J we gonna do it to death
You gon' ruin your rep
Trippin' while we pimpin' these hefers
Playa lectures got me shining like a new Gator stepper
Must have been mad
When your ho put my stuff in the dash
Bust in her ass
To climax I come up with a nab
The game don't stop
Legit ballers bending up the block
Niggas rushing, coming at us cause of status and props
Sucking and fucking, loving it when I put tha dick up inside her

Shit, I put the rubber on tighter
Sent her home, when she entered home
You hugged her up
What the fuck is up?

Got your home, but that's not your bitch

Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was hurtin' 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthin' 'em
H to the Izz-o, V to the Izz-A
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. want to box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the Izz-o, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof, Vamoose, son of a bitch

Holla at me
I do this for my culture
To let 'em know what a nigga look like, when a nigga in a roaster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me I'm raisin the status quo up
I'm over chargin' niggas for what they did to the cold crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks so talk mo' bucks

Yeah
Hov' is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas actin' like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs
No, hov' did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back, sellin' they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner, focused on the Ave.
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamp post, why I got my hand closed?
Cracks in my palm, watchin' the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed in this rap game, the two things that's great

What else can I say about dude, I gets busy

So if you got a racist mind, you be alright

My president is black, but his house is all white
Rosa parks sat so Martin Luther could walk
Martin Luther walked so Barack Obama could run
Barack Obama ran so all the children could fly
So I'ma spread my wings, you can meet me in the sky
I already got my own clothes, already got my own shoes
I was hot

Before Barack
Imagine what I'm gon' do
Hello miss America
Hey pretty lady,
Red, white, and blue flag, wave for me, baby
Never thought I'd say this shit
Baby, I'm good
You can keep your puss
I don't want no more bush (shit)
No more war, no more Iraq
No more white lies, the president is black!

My president is black, my maybach, too
And I'll be god damned if my diamonds ain't blue
My money's dark green and my Porsche is light grey
(hey) I'm headed to D.C, anybody feel me?

Jay-Z,"This is for the soldiers that see the sun at midnight, ya dig
Let me slow down
(It's so incredible)

I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave: you dealin' with some rich niggas
We done lost symbols speakin' cryptic codes
Ancient wisdom, valuable like gifts of gold

I embark on life; my path is all math
I understand the codes these hackers can't crack
I understand the folks expect me to fold
Community control to violate parole
I won't fail, but a lot of men will
I'm iconic in the field like Solomon's Seal

Uh, it's just the intro
Allow my flow time to sink into the tempo

Free Mason
Free Lancer
Free Agents
We faster
Big contracts, big contractors
Built pyramids, period, we masters
No caterpillars, it was just a lot of niggas
A lot of great thinkers and a lot of great inventors
All-white mansion, I'm the child of God
All-black diamonds, times were hard
New Rolls Royce--guess you made it nigga
All-white neighborhood; you they favourite nigga
My top back like JFK
They wanna push my top back like JFK
So, so I JFK
Join forces with the kings and we ate all day
Right now I could rewrite history
I stopped writing so fuck it
I'll do it mentally

[Chorus]
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave: you dealin' with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave: you dealin' with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die

Niggas couldn't do nothing with me; they put the devil on me
I'd have preferred niggas to squeeze the metal on me
Rumors of Lucifer; I don't know who to trust
Whole world want my demise; turn my music up
Hear me clearly: if y'all niggas fear me
Just say y'all fear me
Fuck all these fairy tales
Go to hell; this is God engineering
This is Hail Mary pass; y'all interfering
He without sin shall cast the first stone
So y'all look in the mirror, double check your appearance
Bitch, I said I was amazing
Not that I'm a Mason
It's amazing that I made it though the maze that I was in
Lord, forgive me; I never would've made it without sin
Holy water my face in the basin
Diamonds in my Rosary shows He forgave him
Bitch, I'm red hot; I'm on my third six, but a devil I'm not
My Jesus piece flooded, but thou shall not covet
Keep your eyes off my cupboard; I'm a bad motherfucker
It's 'hov; hust say you love it

[Chorus]

If I ever die, never let it be said I didn't win
Never, never say
Never say Legend didn't go in (I'm-a go in)
I just wanna die on top of the world
Makin' love to my favorite girl
Or makin' beautiful music
We makin' a movie
We knew we was born to do it

[Chorus]",Free Mason,2010
Jay-Z,"Uh, I've been up for four days, gettin' money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolex's, chauffers and low fades
I keep thinkin', how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me ""Nobody's workin' as hard as you""
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
'Cause while all of my closest friends out partyin'
I'm just here makin' all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night, nigga
I got these new rappers nervous: prom night, nigga
I grow tired of these fuckin' grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uh, but I just want to tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin' hard in his yellow goose, yeah
And I'm a motherfuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless, and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talkin' to themselves, Hov, hands free
Yeah, and I'm just fillin' up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammer
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doin' you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow talkin' with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga
When she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I got to feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me

Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Ay Guru tell, tell homegirl to open that Ace right there)
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go

Oww, hoes turn they heads like owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flowin', I'm connected to a higher power
Bright lights will make your whole city light up
A trillion watt light bulb when I'm in the night club
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight 'cause the satellite was crispy, uhh
Y'all can miss me with the money talk
The smart money's on Hov', fuck what the dummies talk, uhh
I don't do too much bloggin'
I just run the town, I don't do too much joggin'
Mm, I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here's how they gon' come at you
With silly rap feuds, tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors, uhh
I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dum-dums could done him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let them tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was cool as the Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would have went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches, too
All I got is this money, this'll do

Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight

Now fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling
In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss bitch of course S.C. on the sleeve

Best rapper alive, best rapper alive",Dirt Off Your Shoulder,2010
Jay-Z,"This is a public service announcement
Sponsored by Just Blaze and the good folks at Roc-A-Fella records
Fellow Americans, it is with the utmost pride and sincerity
That I present this recording, as a living testament and recollection
Of history in the makin' durin' our generation

Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Hov', oh, H to the O V
I used to move snowflakes by the O Z
I guess even back then you can call me
C.E.O. of the ROC, Hov'
Fresh out the fryin' pan into the fire
I be the, music biz number one supplier
Flyer than a piece of paper bearin' my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin' my chain

That's right Hov', oh, not D.O.C.
But similar to them letters, ""No one can do it better""
I check Cheddar like a food inspector
My homey strict told me, ""Dude finish your breakfast""
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude
With the Lexus, fast-forward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
I shoot at you actors like movie directors
This ain't a movie dog

Now before I finish, let me just say
I did not come here to show out
Did not come here to impress you
Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm gone
And I don't care what you think about me, but just remember
When it hits the fan brother, whether it's next year, ten years
Twenty years from now, you're gonna be able to say
That these brothers lied to you Jack

Ving ain't lie
I done came through the block in everything that's fly
I'm like, Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga I get mine, by any means on whenever there's a drought
Get your umbrellas out because, that's when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game
I just rolled the dice, tryin' to get some change

And I do it twice, ain't no sense in me
Lyin' as if, I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There ain't no reason why I be buyin' expensive chains
Hope you don't think, you'se as hardy
Only a fews-us niggaz, gettin' high within' the game
If you do then, how would you explain?
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins

I got a hustler spirit, nigga period
Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go, you are what you are player
And you can try to change but that's just as hot player
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone
Either love me, or leave me alone",Public Service Announcement,2010
Jay-Z,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind

Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cooking raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now what the hell are you waiting for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

Who you know fresher than Hov'?  Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah hearing me rap is like hearing G. Rap in his prime
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young, what the fuck you expect?  Yep, yep
Grand opening, grand closing
God your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you goin' find doper than him with no pen
Just draw off inspiration
Soon you goin' see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for these generations

Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cooking raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

What the hell are you waiting for?

Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan, wearing the 4-5
It ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowing you to smithereens
Cocksucker take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts
So motherfucker if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore

It's star time
This man is made!  He's killing all y'all jive turkeys
Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?
Well if y'all want more of the Jigga man
Then I need y'all to help me, bring him back to stage
Say Hova, c'mon say it!
HO-VA!  HO-VA!  Are y'all out there? (HO-VA! HO-VA!)
Are y'all out there?  C'mon, louder!
Yeah, now see that's what I'm talking bout
They love you Jigga, they love you Jigga!

I like the way this one feel
It's so motherfucking soulful man!
Yeah, okay

So this here is the victory lap
Then I'm leaving, that's how you get me back
After a year of them sixteen's, it's one point two
And that's two point four, and I'm only doing two
You wanted to gain attention new dudes
I can get you BET and TRL too
You wanna be in the public, send your budget
Well fuck it, I ain't budging!
Young did it to death, you gotta love it
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
Now look at me, all star-studded
Golfer above par like I putted
All cause the shit I uttered, was utterly ridiculous
How sick is this?
You want to bang, send Kanye change, send Just some dust
Send Hip a grip, then you got' spit
A little something like this

Lean you to ya side yeah and ask ya who’s ya daddy now
Ain't even gotta open your eyes, know what your looking at
And I ain't even have to open my eyes when I was cooking that
Guess it was love at first sight, eye contact
Remember the night we first met, I caught a contact
Now she's my ride or die, it’s us against the world
You know we both hustlin’ so hustlin’ is our world
Said I must've had too much to drink I’m in my G-Mode
So all the ladies repeat after me cause it’s the G-Code
Promise if I get locked, you’ll come and pay my bond
If you hear some niggas plotting on me, you’ll ring the alarm
And every time you give it to me it’s gon be the bomb
And in these unlucky streets you’re gon’ be my lucky charm

Life’s a bitch but she's the only love that I know -ow -ow
So la-a-dee, after the “I Do’s” lets do Mercedes
Lets tie the knot, lets grab us a pot, lets make a baby
Looking back, I don’t know who threw this bouquet to me
But I walk down this aisle faithfully, cut that cake for me
I, Jay-Z, take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
And 'til the task force roll
To hug her every corner 'til I get ash from the cold
Or until I’ve amassed a fortune, too much cash for me to fold
Fold under pressure I would never, ever, ever, ever
Your secrets I treasure, for better or worse
You’ll always be my first love 'til death do us part
Pull a hearse up, my verse up

Where words tend to get thrown around lightly like like like ""love""
""Friend,"" ""rock star"" and ""So and so’s a genius""
So him vow to never utter him do unless him mean it
Her proud like her mother and ooohh momma’s sweet

So if we ever woop the woop
I want all that bleepty bleep
On this nasty carpet Bixby fresh on one knee
Say I do I do I do I do I do
So we can float up outta here in this hot air balloon
Lets put a baby butterfly up in your lil’ cocoon
And maybe twenty-thirty our baby, she’ll be nerdy make the whole club swoon

The paper read ""murder, black-on-black murder""
Paper read ""murder, black-on-black murder"" again

This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
All-black everything, nigga you know my fresh code
I’m out here fighting for you, don’t increase my stress load!
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you

And I’m from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like ""damn I was just with him after school""
No shop class but half the school got a tool
And a ""I could die any day""-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
It’s time for us to stop and redefine black power
Forty one souls murdered in fifty hours

The paper read ""murder, black-on-black murder""
The paper read ""murder, black-on-black murder"" again, murder again

Is it genocide?
'Cause I can still hear his mama cry
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain’t got enough room for all the tombs
It’s a war going on outside we ain’t safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
Three hundred and fourteen soldiers died in Iraq,
Five hundred and nine died in Chicago

I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Uh, real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21 I was supposed to die
So I’m out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to insure your survival
You're gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? What up, cous'? It’s all black, I love us

The paper read ""murder, black-on-black murder""

Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I’m present
I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I “shh-shh”
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new black elite
They say my Black Card bears the mark of the beast
I repeat: my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
What’s up to Will? Shout out to O
That ain’t enough.. we gonna need a million more
""Kick in the door"" Biggie flow
I’m all dressed up with nowhere to go

Yeah it’s all messed up when it’s nowhere to go
So we won’t take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees to hold G’s, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG’s
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see, black guys?
What’s the life expectancy for black guys?
The system’s working effectively, that’s why!
I’ll be a real man and take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie cause ain’t nothin' on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci, now ain’t nothing new but your shoes

I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

Up in the clouds, me and my spouse
Rumors on the ground gettin' too loud, please turn them shits down (down, down)
Can't hear myself think
Turbulence, shit, almost spilled my drink
In the White House with a mink
Running through that bitch like it's my house
All up in the hall like a mall
Told you motherfuckers, all I do is ball
No, I don't 'member you, I don't intend to empty my memory bank
It's a million dollars in it, baby, Hilary Swank
Sittin' next to Hillary smellin' like dank
Presidental pardon, name one nigga out there harder than him
I'll wait

I've been in my wave like twenty years straight
I've been on my vibe like twenty years straight
Don't fuck up my high (fuck up my high)
Nights like this, I could fuck up a pie
And still be straight (still be straight)
Fall back, bitch, I got a lot on my plate
Don't waste my breath
I don't know how many moons a nigga got left
Back to this joint
Smokin' this shit like I'm tryna' prove a point
I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno
Kill my vibe, that's your motherfuckin' funeral (haha)

Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals, niggas pissed off
I ministered this generation my fort
Leader of the new school
On my toes like a ballerina, who knew I'd be Black Swan
World in my palms, ironically I am the Globetrotters' best 'cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggas when I was sixteen that I'd write a sixteen
To put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with six teens
Should have been in the pen but now my pen write with morphine
I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends
I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket
Cardio lap, was running for dear life but now I'm running the map bitch, I'm here nigga
Picture lil' ol' me giving a fuck from what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga you never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre
You ain't get killed in Vegas or in a Suburban
Nigga, Puffy Daddy wasn't your favorite
So many washed up with detergent
But I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose like bla'!
Mini-14 like bla'!
Empty out another magazine like bla'!
Let a young nigga get by!
I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe!
I am the bad, the good God, the last the hood got
The last that would try to pass a good job

We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls
""You can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful
But not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man""
Because I am female
I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that
Marriage is the most important
Now marriage can be a source of
Joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
Which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
Feminist: the person who believes in the social
Political, and economic equality of the sexes

Father never taught me how to be a father, treat a mother
I don't wanna have to just repeat another leave another
Baby with no daddy want no mama drama
I just wanna take her back to a time when everything was calmer
Out in Paris on a terrace watching the Eiffel Tower
And a Ferris wheel yet and still, nothing could prepare us
For the beauty that you be Blue be
Looking in your eyes is like a mirror, have to face my fears
Cheer up, why can't you just be happy
Without these back and forth thoughts, you too much like your daddy
Badly I just wanna spent more time with him
Sadly life wouldn't let me get around with him
Now I got my own daughter, taught her how to take her first steps
Cut the cord watch her take her first breath
And I'm trying and I'm lying if I said I wasn't scared
But in life and death if I ain't here

Apologies in order
To Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me
You would be with me
Sort of like daddy dearest",JAY Z Blue,2013

Got a thing for nickel plated nines and pretty dimes
Mac-11 I squeeze like lemon limes
Squirt obey your thirst, fashion lines
Between beauty and beast, I walk the line
Johnny Cash, I'm a real G
I cut myself today to see if I still bleed
Success is so sublime
Gotta do that time to time so I don't lose my mind
Something 'bout the struggle so divine
This sort of love is hard to define
When you scratching for every nickel and dime
Got me itching to do this shit for my mom
Do this shit for my town
Leave the door open hoping they kick it down

I gave some money to this guy, he got high as hell
Now I'm part of the problem far as I could tell
Did I do it for him or do it for myself
Can't lie to myself
I love my niggas more than my own blood
I die for my niggas and I love my cub, hope that's not fucked up
I got a problem with the handouts, I took the man route
I'll give an opportunity though, that's the plan now
No guilt in giving clear a nigga conscience out
No guilt in receiving, every thing within reason
Can't see it taking food out my little monster's mouth
That'll drive me gaga
Run up in your momma's house, two nickels, one dime
Manslaughter charges, the lawyer, knocked it down
I'm just trying to find common ground
'fore Mr. Belafonte come and chop a nigga down
Mr. Day O, major fail

With eyes wide shut, I could cook up two bricks
Turn nickels to dime, turn dimes to quarters
Turn wives from daughters, oh, I'm clear as water
And just for clarity, my presence is charity
My flow is a gift, philanthropist
Everybody 'round me rich, or will be
Baby boy I promise you this, or kill me
And when a nigga go as the old adage go
You die rich or you die disgraced, so just let me grow
Watch me cook, throw no looks
Like Magic in his prime when Kareem sky hooked, yeah
Y'all not worthy, sometimes I feel like
Y'all don't deserve me, my flow unearthly

Today, we have a serious decision that needs to be made for our family
There's a young cat out here that's growing old
Quick and fast in our organization
And today he must step up and be made
And I think you all know
  Who's this guy mayn?
This guy is Silkk, Silkk the Shocker
His contribution to the streets has grown so fast he's grown weak. Kay?
  You know what, this decison must be made now and only now
Isn't he young?
  He's a stand up guy, he's a born leader, he has my blood
I was also a young when I started
  So be it
Godfather, please, let me be the one to tell him he's a Made Man
  Not now, let the Don tell him
Dannny Divuchi, bring Silkk to me
  Godfather, you won't regret it
Yo Don, what up with this visit to
  Okay mayn, have a seat, ju know
  I'm here to tell you some good news mayn
  You're a Made Man now, everybody stand up

[Silkk the Shocker]
Last Year, I was the help, this year I'm the boss
You don't like it?  Fuck y'all, they'll find y'all niggaz lost
Fuck with real niggaz, mob figures
Not you niggaz that's soft
I'm talking about visiting some of you niggaz
Some of you, niggaz is talk
I always been a made man starting when I was, just a teen
Through the streets where I knew how to hustle
So the Don, put me down on his team
Told me to be, down to take a chance
Ya gotta be down to dirty dance
If so, the world can be yours so I put my, life in his hands
I know I'm up in the game, but I learned quickly
Told me you could live good
But wouldn't give it up when they come to get you
Told me never make, moves with your heart
Never snitch if you get caught
Never trust anybody a 100 percent, realize anybody can be bought
Everybody got a price
Money's nothing without
Power respect, loyalty, is a way of life
You've been chosen, to be the Made Man
Everybody gotta turn
there's rules to this shit
That everybody gotta learn
To go from poverty to riches
Before I rule, choose my girl
Today it's the streets, tomorrow. I rule the world

[Chorus]
I want the world the and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Power, loyalty, respect, from the cradle to the grave
I want to rule and I did, the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

I want the world and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Born leader, from the cradle, to the grave
I want to rule and I got my chance the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

[Silkk the Shocker]
I want the finer things, the car, house, and diamond rings
Wait patiently cause I know that time will bring it. (time will bring)
I'm a Made Man touch it no mo, I don't touch no coke
I'm a made man, fuck it
I don't even show up for court
Judge tried to give me ten
Pointed the middle finger cause I, thought he was trippin
I can tell him why every nigga I had beef with
them niggaz, wind up missin'
Used to be broke, but now I'm nothing but dollar signs
Used to be convicted felonies but now if I get convicted
It's white collar crimes
Shit never been nervous, if I was, never let it show
Cause of my baby face
I did a lot of crime but, they let me go
Usually females come to get me
Never ever, leave no witnesses
If I gotta do it, it gotta get done, nothin' personal just business
A Made Man with a vision
Learned to, master the system
My family never see's me
I just send em, presents on Christmas
I want the world, take trips to Reno, stock in a Casino
Make a lot of loot, have suits designed by, Valentino
I want the world, and everything up in it, when I said it I meant it
Time to ride high, this time is, sky's the limit
Sometimes it feels like my last line, my last rhyme
Gave the world to little brothers
Never been nothing but the last Don
I want the world

[Chorus]",The Day I Was Made,2013
Jay-Z,"(Silkk)
??  how I miss my homies so
I don't expect y'all to understand this
Cause y'all ain't never lost nobody
But imagine the closest person to you
See everybody feel it
But some of us
Feel it more than the rest
Just think about it
It only add 
More to the stress
I try to live my life day by day
And ignore the rest
It's so FUCKED UP
I can feel life
More than I feel death
Split second
And picture
The family's being torn
I gotta tell my little nephew
His dad wasn't around
To see him being born
When we get older
Playing with our kids
He just sittin' all alone
You know what his last birthday wish was
He wishes daddy come home
And while I'm at the funeral 
Contemplating sittin' in strap
He looked up to me
Gave me a hug and asked me
""Silkk, where my daddy at?""
Question I couldn't answer
Tell him a vacation
And somehow I wish
If I tell him this enough
Maybe one day 
He just might forget

(Chorus)
I guess I'll be seeing you
At the end of the road (end of the road, I'll see y'all there)
You know it ain't easy
Lettin' my homie go (end of the road, I'll see y'all there
	(repeat)

(Silkk)
Now I learn ??
I miss my homies so 
Even though
My homies gone 
Try to be strong on my dawgs
Used to hit me
But I'm home alone
All the memories I got of you
Shining like the sun
I used to invite you to my house
We used to fight
Who gone sleep in the top bunk
We used to
Throw rocks
To the cops then we'd run
We was so tight
We got caught
Both of us
They got just one
I remember dawg
We just like
Kick back and laughed
We grew up a little bit
Life made us choose a 
Different path
You chose to get a job
And I sold and dealed
You choose to go to school
And i chose the streets
I was the one that
Always lived fast
You used to want to live slowly
As I look in the casket
I though for sure
It was supposed to be me
Damn I lost my dawg
It's cold but its fair
And I contemplate to myself
Would it have been different
If I would've been there
I guess we'll never never
Never know
But I know one thing
Why's it always the good ones that got to go

(chorus2x)

(Silkk)
It's never easy 
To let your loved ones go
Tomorrow now promise me
Tell me something that your loved ones know
A straight bullet in the neighborhood
Got a little girl
Holdin' her breath
In my arms I closed her eyes
She died while I was 
Holdin' her chest
I couldn't change
Even though the game was file
Through all the pain
Maintain
Still find ways to smile
And grandma(grandmama got sick)
And they fixed her to bed rest
The family was fightin' over who? left the money to
Picture this you won't even dead yet
And I'm sick of this east and west coast crap
This east and west coast trap
Lost two of the biggest mc's
To east and west coast rap
Rest in peace Biggie
Rest in peace Pac
And all them other soldiers
Make us see it??",End Of The Road,2013

(Lemme holla at you dog) She done met up with a star, eye contact
I nodded, she nodded back, then we met up at the bar

And I'll still respect you tomorrow, and tonight I hit it
But you only got a couple minutes to choose
And my time is like dollars so I only got a couple minutes to lose

Probably cause I'm platinum, we dark, could be chillin at two
(The south west connect, big chains on our neck
Boy give us respect, y'all shit on deck)
Aight Snoop, you got the weed (yeah) and I got the liquor (fa sho)

Cause ain't no party like the ones we drove (whassup)
And um, ain't no cars like the ones we drove 
And um, ain't no dollars like the ones we fold
When we give somethin, call us, it's outta control
(So whether it's summertime, winter, spring or fall
Look for somethin big from Silkk and Top Dogg)
We party with nothin but bud, nothin but thugs
East to west, peep the best, keep it stress, nothin but love (yeah)

Jay-Z,"Picture this, any man that hustle because like to is a fool.
Any man that hustle because he got to feed his family.... 
That's a real man.nYou see I hustle because I got feed me family 
I got families to feed, I got feed my mama, 
I got to feed big mama, I got to feed my cousin, 
I got to feed my lil' brother, I got to feed my sister, 
I got to feed my kids, I got to feed my people.

[Chorus]
The ghetto's got me hustlin' tryin' to survive
The ghetts got me hustlin' tryin' to stay alive.
The ghetto get me hustlin' tryin' to survive,
And I know I'm goin' to hustle until the day I die.

Uh!
It's da black rain to da moon and tears that cause lies
See that's the way I felt when my lil' brother died.
And some fools say it ain't no justice 
And other niggaz say it ain't no peace
That's why thugs help their on these projects and on these streets.
See my daddy made me a dealer
And my cousin made me killer.
See that's why everything we do, they gonna respect us and feel us
And I'm still tryin' to understand why big daddy was with da rest
And my nephew on the last counter on da 14th down the car reck.
It ain't muthafucker down on dope, on crack, or aids
And I see so many ghetto people go to jail 
And live your life and die like slaves.
I got a relative on apeel doin' 25 flat
On murder or ride nigga fuck it Johnny Cochran can't fight that.
And since I'm black and I'm rich 
They see to overlook It's me advise
First class niggaz tryin' call da police tryin' to book us.
Ain't that a bitch, I done made millions 
And still goin' through a thang
That's niggaz ask me P why the fuck you never change.

[Chorus]

It's like I'm rich and poor
I open the world and slang dop
It's the world changes know and changes I thorp.
I thank all my big brothers with out him I wouldn't made it through
So with life on line put all up 4 him so I put that shit on TRU.
The ghetto got me caught up, no broken dreams
The ghettos trap, I see some on crack, and dope fiends.
My hommie, Never did no crime but lien' up in the hearse
Thank god 4 all that I got from that times can be worst.
Ever feel like you was swimming, and really was dronin'
You ain't want to smile but your tender smile always see me clownin'
I trade my life to make the world better 
Trade everything I got including life 
To bring back my brother Kevin.
See I spit the realist shit 
Tryin' make y'all feel this shit.
Y'all tryin' put the finger on our side, 
Livin' middle bricks livin' this shit.
See I tell you everybody use to ride benzes 
But we had to ride buggies
Mom wanted better things for me 
But private school was way past our budget.
So if I'm  happy and I'm smilin' and I'm camouflage my problems
The only way I can really solve them 
If I really grab and revolve them.
So I grab it and I cocked it
I was going to pop it.
But I stop, forgot I was rich.
What everybody not rich.
Every month so close to gettin' no profits
My only hustle, I told them to stop it, 
But can't really knock it.
Everybody died up in game 
Everybody tryin' to maintain 
Wall from out da ghetto, 
Close my eyes and still see the pain.
Sometimes I just get fed up.
To all my souljas worldwide 
I know its hard to stride. 
Keep your head up!

Yo Yo Yo I never was the type to stress
Get It off my chest

if y'all was real
y'all can fill in the rest
we both say yes
guess we were both like phony
jumped in too quick
ideally cus we both was lonely
we go 2 stores and you never peek at the price
Treat you right had a bad day i just greet you with ice
you know Silkk The Shocker hang with the thugs and the dealers
wasn't the realest Never the type to get in to expressing my feelings
I ain't gon lie It wasn't all bad
Some was good
matter fact it was all that'
Sometimes i feel like we just didn't match
Found a friend
But only friend till then you alwayz came first
Never type to creep Alwayz tried to make things work
What What

Chorus

[Silkk The Shocker]
I want to be with you but i can't hope you understand and all
Tried to make this thang work
Got knocked you'll be the first person i call
Now with you can be myself
with her it's like i'm living a lie
I do everything for her it seems like she never satisfied
If i give her 3 karats then she probably want four
If I want to go places then she probably just don't want to go
Now sometimes I feel like we settled
in the back of our minds
we all feel like we can find something better
Now with you it' like you know me
Like her she really don't understand me
I know I live the way I live
But she's all for changing me
I don't care for girl with no money
When I come home I ain't tryin to cuss
Am I asking for much?
But I can't sit here and pretend
I don't care
To have both y'all along
That wouldn't be fair
So if it's a puzzle
I think I maybe just missing a clue
Leave or Stay?
God tell me what's a nigga to do
What What What

For real, I know we from different sides and all
And I ain't even goin' lie, I'm a thug
But I got a question for you
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me
What's up?

[Chorus]
So what you want to do
A girl like me, a guy like you
What we could do
It's whatever baby anything that we want to
Will I fall for a thug like you

[Silk]
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me and um
In fact if you could
I got money now
Can you see yourself if you had to move back up in the hood

Now during sex lay there I'm a have to ask if it's good
This rap stuff stressful let's go see if we can relax in the woods
When I first met you at the bus stop lookin' all shy-like
Tellin' your friend how much that you hated my type

But I'm ready to change, 
I'm willin' to put the game on it, put the range on it
Put powerful things on it
Sooner or later probably have tattos with my name on it

Now look I like to live fast, addicted to cash, the 45 on the dash
And you know me, if you know me, o.g. I'm down to act bad
I need a more than a friend but not quite a relationship
A girl when I come off tour I can't wait to get with

Not the stupid chick the one I probably could vacation with
You gotta go somewhere you know what boo go ahead
Take the six
Now you gotta make a choice either wrong or right
You tried before maybe you just need a thug in your life
What's up

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You keep, keep on askin me
If I, say if I want to be with you
The tough part is to think I could
Fall for some body like you

[Silk]
You advanced, took a couple chances and shit
Chances with bricks, couple chances now you sittin in 
Mansions and shit
You done gambled with this thug and won

You know what I'm sayin it's thug life
Cock the glock, pop the glock, drop the top and run
I can't change I'm to deep in it so let me know if you wit me
Can't make no promises but if we make it through boo 

Then sky's the limit
We on the west on the beach, we takin trips to the east
Takin shoppin sprees 'til they damn near hurt our feet
Got you a five when you like smashed the four

Didn't even wreck it you just laid there and scratched the door
Step out the house it's more like a fashion show
Anything and everything you want you got that you ain't even gotta
Ask no more...imagine that

It never really mattered too much to me
That you were just too damn ghetto for me
