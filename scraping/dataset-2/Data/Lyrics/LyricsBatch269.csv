Frank Bright,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day,2006
Frank Bright,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I",Bewitched,2009
Frank Bright,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me,2009
Frank Bright,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2009
Frank Butler,"La la la la la la, la la la la la la
My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the milky way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
Maybe someday, you'll see my face amoung the crowd
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

Frank Campagna,"Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Why should we cling to some old faded thing
That used to be

Then you don't worry 'bout me",Don't Worry About Me,2002
Frank Campagna,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You,2002
Frank Campagna,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love,2002
Frank Campagna,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,2002
Frank Campagna,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you are the lover I have waited for
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love",That Old Black Magic,2002
Frank Campagna,"You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you 
You ought to know, for haven't I told you so
 
A million or more times?
You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you

I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now
(You went away and my heart went with you

Frank Capp,"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

I won't know sweet music until you return some day",I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart,1987
Frank Capp,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,1987
Frank Capp,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear
 
Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear",Spring Is Here,1987
Frank Capp,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams

Frank Capp,"Now won't you listen honey, while I say, 
How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart 

You know I've loved you for these many years, 
Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears? 
Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'

And you'll miss, and you'll miss,
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it

Frank Carey,"I want to Learn
(Anderson Howe Wakeman Bruford)
I want to learn more about you
We haven't spoke in quite a while
And all of the dreams that come true
So surprising how it catches you

I want to learn more about me
I've been sinking like a setting stone
And now the dreams are realising it's true
That's why I want to learn about you

I want to know more about life
And things that can fly in between my mind
I want to change all the I dream about
My waking and my so many lives, oh my

ii She Gives Me Love
(Anderson Howe Wakeman Bruford Dowling)
She gives me love
When love had gone away
When the pressure came so fast
She give me love
Long distance runaround
And in between the pressure
I was summoned

How did we dance on the south side of the sky
We saw the flags flying on the moon
And through the gates of delirium so fast
Believing in the light was a beginning
Only to believe in you
Only to believe in you

She give me love
When I was losing fast
I was awakened by the dream
She was the love for me
the first and last
And all that I remembered
Was the roundabout only to believe in you

iii Who Was The First
(Anderson Howe Wakeman Bruford)
Who was the first to show
The moon at night
Is never so far away
We are the first to define the
Languages of love

Who was the first to learn
The universal consciousness divine
We are the first to discover
This day in our time

And when the history of science
Re-writes itself eac",Quartet,1999

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

Frank Carlberg,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1993

With flowers in her hair
Her perfume smells like summer air

And her skin white like cocaine but soft as silk
And her hair is as black as a reservoir

But if there is I will climb out, dive in again

I'm gonna need some

Like stars in the sky just floating there
A constelation gorgeous and new
You called it The Lovers
I believed it was true

And all of a sudden you rose from our nest
No longer felt love
I felt sorrow instead
As you walked you combed out your hair
And all the flowers fell like birds through the air

Asleep in the grass, both feeling insane
And if this isn't love don't show me the truth

The Lovers are cursed

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2005

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2005

Frank Comstock,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1994

Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Honey, here's the way it's goin' to be:
You will set behind a team of snow white horses,
In the slickest gig you ever see!
Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppin' strutters.
Nosey pokes'll peek thru' their shutters and their eyes will pop!
The wheels are yeller, the upholstery's brown,
The dashboard's genuine leather,
With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,
In case there's a change in the weather.
Two bright sidelight's winkin' and blinkin',
Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin'
You c'n keep your rig if you're thinkin' 'at I'd keer to swap
Fer that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top! Did you say 
the fringe was made of silk
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
Does it really have a team of snow white horses
One's like snow, the other's more like milk
All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
When we hit that road, hell fer leather,
Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather,
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over:
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop
In that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!
I can see the stars gettin' blurry,
When we drive back home in the surrey,
Drivin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!
I can feel the day gettin' older,
Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!
The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill;
The moon is takin' a header,
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,
A lark'll wake up in the medder.
Hush, you bird, my baby's a-sleepin'!
Maybe got a dream worth a-keepin'

And you're gonna shake me down somehow.
So what's the use,

Nowadays we often gaze 
On women over fifty
Without the slightest trace 
Of wrinkles on their face
Doctors go and take their dough 
To make them young and nifty
But Doctors I defy
To tell me just why
No matter how young a prune may be
It's always full of wrinkles
We may get them on our face
Prunes get 'em every place
Prohibition worries us
But prunes don't sit and brood
For no matter how young a prune may be
It's always getting stewed

In the kingdom of the fruits
The prune is snubbed by others
And they are not allowed
To mingle with the crowd
Though they're never on display
With all their highbrow brothers
They never seem to mind
To this fact they're resigned
That no matter how young a prune may be
It's always full of wrinkles
Beauty treatments always fail
They've tried all to no avail
Other fruits are envious
Because they know real well
That no matter how young a prune may be
Hot water makes 'em swell

Baby prunes look like their dad
But not wrinkled quite as bad

Every day in every way
The world is getting better
We've even learned to fly
As days go passing by
But how about the poor old prune
His life is only wetter
No wonder he can't win
In the awful stew he's in
No matter how young a prune may be
He's always full of wrinkles
We may get them on our face
Prunes get 'em every place
Nothing ever worries them
Their life's an open book
But no matter how young a prune may be
It has a worried look

Prunes act very kind they say
When sickly people moan
But no matter how young a prune may be
It has a heart of stone",Song of the Prune,1992

You've made me break a many true vow

You've filled my heart with weary old blues

I got just what I wanted this year
I got an Abercrombie blazer with a thin pinstripe
I got a velvet smoking jacket with a Dunhill pipe

And there's that lovely paisley muffin, ah it's so my type
Just what I wanted my dear
Just what I need for Christmas 

All the things I've always dream of
I got some jungle gym pajamas and some Alpine hats
Some real Parisian painted neckwear that they call cravats 
They are hard to find but you, you done
Found some doeskin spats
Just what I want my love

So ring out the Noel
When you're headed and distraught
If your shopping did not go well
It's not what you bought it's the Yuletide thought
But all I want for Christmas
Was the thought you were thinking of me

I would say that you've been twice as busy as a Christmas Elf
I'll bet that personally you have emptied every modern shelf
But what I wanted by my Christmas tree was your sweet self

Said don't get yourself in a sweat 
When things look gray, 
Just shrug and say: 
""It musta been somethin' I et!"" 
""So don't get yourself in a snit, "" he said, 
""Tuck your tantrums into your kit instead 
""It's disarming to be charming,"" 
Quoth the medicine man, 
Whom all agree it's plain to see 
Nobody could be wiser than 

So if your temper's getting a top hand, 
All you have to do is just stop and 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Chattahoochee's, Chippewas do 

If you're feeling mad as a wet hen, 
Mad as you can possibly get, then 
Pass that peace pipe, bury that tomahawk 
Like those Chichamecks, Cherokees, 
Chapultepec's do 
That cold shoulder never solved a single complaint 
When you're older, you'll wipe off all of that war paint 

If you find yourself in a fury, 
Be your own judge and your own jury 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Chattahoochee's, Chippewas do 

If you want to hover out west, too, 
You will soon discover it's best to 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choktohs, Changos, 
Chattanooga's, Cheekarohs do 

Even in colonial days, you 
Know the ceremonial ways to 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that tomahawk 
Like those Chakootamees, Chepacheps 
'N' Chicopees, too 
Pull your ears in, try to use a little control 
When ""all clear""'s in, you'll be top man on the totem pole 

So, if you wanna be an all-right guy 
Not a long face, blues-in-the-night guy 
Write that apology and dispatch it! 
When you quarrel, it's grand to patch it! 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 

Like those Choctaws, Chickasaws,

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

There's never been a better crew
And when you hear the drummer
Lawdy, how the joint'll hum
A cuttin' capers just for you

You'll never pick about or pick a quarr'l
With Mister Krupa or with Frankie Carle

And Tommy Dorsey's in it, too

Never heard it played with such a tone

Out in the woodshed, son

Boy, he plays it, he really lays it, in your lap, lap, lap

Cuttin' capers 'cause I'm out with you
Nothin' else that I'm about to do

I even stutter

When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
It's no matter darling where you are
I think of you

Day and night, night and day, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you

Day and night, night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through
Until you let me spend my life making love to you

There is nothing for me but to love you
Just the way you look tonight

With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that smile that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""

Have you ever made love so good that the journey was better 
Baby we aint gotta rush to the finish line
We'll take our time and let it unwind

Frank Farian,"Ich weiß noch
Als ich 18 war
Da kam sie hier vorbei

Schmale Schultern
Dunkles Haar und Augen voller Scheu
Bis wir beide Freunde wurden
Ja
Das dauerte ganz schön lang

Wir haben manche Nacht geredet
Bis der Morgen kam
Sie sagte 
Rocky, Ich habe noch niemals geliebt
Ich weiß nicht, ob ich das bringe
Denn es gehört doch mehr dazu
Als ein Flirt und ein paar Ringe

Ich sagte, 
Kopf hoch, Baby
Lehn' dich an mich
Es wird schon irgendwie gehen
Denn wenn du mir ein wenig hilfst
Ist Liebe kein Problem

Wir suchten uns ein Zimmer
Und wir richteten uns ein
Wir schliefen auf dem Boden
Und wir tranken roten Wein
Waren glücklich und verrückt 
So wie Verliebte sind

Bis wir eines Tages merkten
Sie bekommt ein Kind
Sie sagte,
""Rocky, Ich hab' noch nie ein Kind bekommen
Ich will es dir gern geben

Und damit ist die Zeit der 
Träume vorbei in unserem Leben
Ich sagte, 
Kopf hoch, Baby
Lehn' dich an mich
Es wird schon irgendwie gehen
Ich helf' dir doch so gut ich kann
Du schaffst es
Du wirst sehen

Sie schenkte mir ein Mädchen
Ich war mächtig stolz auf sie

Wir stritten und versöhnten uns
Die Zeit war schön wie nie

Wenn es auch mal schwierig war
Es gab immer einen Weg

Bis ich dann die Wahrheit sah
Dass sie nicht mehr lange lebt
Sie sagte,
Rocky, ich habe solche Angst zu sterben
Ich weiß nicht, was danach kommt
Gibt es einen neuen Morgen in einer anderen Welt?

Nun sind wir allein
Das kleine Mädchen ist bei mir
Manchmal muss ich weinen
Viel zu ähnlich sieht sie ihr

Doch wenn ich ganz verzweifelt bin
Und nicht mehr weiter kann
Dann nimmt sie meine Hand
Und schaut mich mit großen Augen an
Und sie sagt,
""Rocky, ich war doch noch niemals allein
Ich weiß so wenig vom Leben
Ich bin ja noch so klein
Und kann dir nicht mehr als Liebe geben

Ich sagte,
Kopf hoch,Baby
Lehn' dich an mich
Es wird schon irgendwie gehen
Denn wenn du mir ein wenig hilfst
Werde ich es überstehen

Sie sagte
Rocky, ich war doch noch niemals allein
Ich weiß nicht, ob ich das bringe
Ich brauche deine Augen
Und deine Hand und deine Stimme

Ich sagte, 
Kopf hoch, Baby
Lehn' dich an mich
Es wird schon irgendwie gehen
Denn wenn du mir ein wenig hilfst
Werde ich es überstehen",Rocky,2008
Frank Farian,"This is the story of El Lute
A man who was born to be hunted like a wild animal
Because he was poor
But he refused to accept his fate
And today his honor has been restored

He was only nineteen and he was sentenced to die
For something that somebody else did and blamed on El Lute
Then they changed it to life and so he could escape
From then on they chased him and searched for him day and night
All over Spain but the search was in vain for El Lute

He had only seen the dark side of life the man they called El Lute
And he wanted a home just like you and like me
In a country where all would be free
So he taught himself to read and to write it didn't help El Lute
He was one who had dared to escape overnight they had to find El Lute

No one gave you a chance in the Spain of those days
On the walls every place they had put up the face of El Lute
And he robbed where he could just like once Robin Hood
They finally caught him and that seemed the end
But they caught him in vain 'cause a change came for Spain and El Lute

He had only seen the dark side of life the man they called El Lute
And he wanted a home just like you and like me
In a country where all would be free
And then freedom really came to his land and also to El Lute
Now he walks in the light of a sunny new day the man they called El Lute",El  Lute,2011

I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Frank Fields,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1991
Frank Fields,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,1991

Down in the old neighborhood
Just to be with Charlie, with little Joe and Pete
Boy, we had a quartette that was mighty hard to beat
I'd love to stand down by that cellar door
Just to hear that quartette sing once more
 
""Heart Of My Heart"", I love that melody
""Heart Of My Heart"" brings back a memory
When we were kids on the corner of the street
We were rough and ready guys
But Oh! How we could harmonize
""Heart Of My Heart""
Meant friends were dearer then
Too bad we had to part
I know a tear would glisten if once more I could listen
To that gang that sang ""Heart Of My Heart""

For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,1963

The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Save all who dare the eagle's flight.

Protect them wheresoe'er they go.

The king of the castle, the queen of the may 
Just me and my sister, in a world of pretend 
Where the sun would keep shining, the day never end

Another year over, and see how they've grown 
Then we'd watch the last sunset, and walk arm in arm 
Till I see you next summer; God keep you from harm 
And if I was a flier who crashed now and then, 
She would put me together and fly me again.

And if I was a flier who crashed now and then,

Her life has been taken, and I'll never know why 
But I feel in that moment, a part of me died...

And then you came 
And made my dreams match reality
Maybe you can see 
All the things you''ve meant to me
And my simple fate is at the gate 
And, girl, you''ve got the key

It seems like yesterday 
You and I first loved this way
But now I know how love 
Can grow with each and every day
As we lay at midnight''s hour 
And feel love''s hidden power
So strong and bold 
As life unfolds its mystery to me

You and me for eternity 
In love will always be
Young and free and that should be 
The way it''s gotta be",Fallin' in Love,2006

I'm in love,

I'm in love, 
I'm in love, with a beautiful girl, 
But she don't give a darn about me
to make her love me I tried,
How I sighed and I cried 
But she just refused 
And ever since she's gone away,
I've got those lovesick blues
 
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,"" 
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""

with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy"" 
Twas just a beautiful dream
 
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart  it seems
I got so used to her somehow
But I'm no body's baby

Frank Ifield,"Her name was Joanne, and she lived in a meadow by a pond.
And she touch'd me for a moment,
with a look that spoke to me of her sweet love.
Then the woman that she was drove her on with desperation,
and I saw as she went a most hopeless situation.
For Joanne, and the man, and the time that made them both wrong.
 
She was only a girl, I know that will, and still I could not see;
That the hold she had was much stronger than the love she had for me.
But staying with her, and my little bit of wisdom,
broke down her desires like a light thru a prism;
into yellows and blues and a tune that I could not have sung.
 
Tho' the essence is gone,
I have no tear to cry for her 
and my only tho't of her is kind.

When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair.
