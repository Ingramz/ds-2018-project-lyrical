Stefano di Battista,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You,2005
Stefano di Battista,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2005
Stefano di Battista,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad
Round, Round, Round Midnight",Round Midnight,2005
Stefano Di Battista Quintet,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1998
Stefano Di Battista Quintet,"Moonlight and magnolia, starlight in your hair
All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight",Stars Fell on Alabama,1998
Stefano Maltese,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2001
Stefano Prada,"Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power, but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

Can you imagine when this race is won?
Turn our golden the faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the madman

Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever

Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever young

Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?

It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever

So many adventures given up today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
Oh let it come true.

Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever, and ever?

Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever, and ever?

Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever

Steffany Frizzell-Gretzinger,"You've brought me to the end of myself
This has been the longest road
Just when my hallelujah was tired
You gave me a new song

I'm letting go
I'm letting go
I'm letting go
Falling into You

I confess I still get scared sometimes
But perfect love comes rushing in
And all the lies screamed inside go silent
The moment You begin

I'm letting go
I'm letting go
I'm letting go
Falling into You

You remind me
Of things forgotten
You unwind me
Until I'm totally undone
And with Your arms around me
Fear was no match for Your love
Now You've won me

And if I lived a thousand lifetimes
And wrote a song for every day
Still there would be no way to say
How You have loved me

Oh, how You love me
And that's how You've won me",Letting Go,2014
Steffany Frizzell-Gretzinger,"Night turns to morning
You have been waiting
Whispering to me
Gently I'm waking

It's the dawn of a new day
You've painted for me
Colors exploding
Telling our story

I'm waking up
I'm waking up
I'm waking up
I'm waking up

Night turns to morning
You have been waiting
Whispering to me
Gently I'm waking

It's the dawn of a new day
You've painted for me
Colors exploding
Telling our story

I'm waking up
I'm waking up
I'm waking up
I'm waking up

I can feel the rising of the sun
Mercy sings me the promise of Your love
And I'm reminded how far we've come
You're the One that my heart is beating for

I'm waking up",Morning Song,2014

You're safe here with Me
There's no need to cover
What I already see

You've got your reasons
But I hold your peace
You've been on lock-down
And I hold the key

'Cause I loved you before you knew it was love
And I saw it all, still I chose the cross
And you were the one that I was thinking of
When I rose from the grave

Now rid of the shackles, My victory's yours
I tore the veil for you to come close
There's no reason to stand at a distance anymore
You're not far from home

And now I'll be your lighthouse
When you're lost at sea
And I will illuminate
Everything

No need to be frightened by intimacy
No, just throw off your fear
And come running to Me

'Cause I loved you before you knew it was love
And I saw it all, still I chose the cross
And you were the one that I was thinking of
When I rose from the grave
Now rid of the shackles, My victory's yours

Steffany Frizzell-Gretzinger,"You steady me
Slow and sweet, we sway
Take the lead and I will follow
Finally ready now
To close my eyes and just believe
That You won't lead me where You don't go

When my faith gets tired
And my hope seems lost
You spin me round and round
And remind me of that song
The one You wrote for me
And we dance
And we dance

And I've been told
To pick up my sword and fight for love
Little did I know that Love had won for me
Here in Your arms

You still my heart again

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Then let the fire start

Stella,"I had a dream,
A long happy dream,
That kind of dream you don't wanna wake up from.

I had a dream,
I thought you were with me,
Let's move away where nothing can touch us.

I had a dream,
And maybe you'd like to follow me,
To the country.
Where nothing really happens.

I have something you can call a weakness.
I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,
In this town.

I have a feeling,
It could be simple.
A horse and lake,
And then just the forest.

And you and me are riding from all the troubles.
From all the people,
All the houses,
We have passed,
They follow us,
But nobody can catch us.

I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,

She lit up

She's the face of the day
She's known for being that way
Every man wants a part
Its what all women want
Sugar girl
Your a diva
The press would really like to know
Do you adore yourself
Like all the rest of us do

She said as the sun
As ever the moon
You put it together
I am twilight
As ever I'm black
As ever I'm white
You put me together 
I am twilight

As ever I'm dark
As ever I""m white 
You put me together
I am twilight
I am twilight

For every time
I'm getting more openhearted

There's a lot you can teach me

Would you laugh at me

Could you feel the same way too

No one to see
And I am never invited

Our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass by the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh, yes
Those crazy years
That was the time of the flower-power
But underneath
We had a fear of flying
Of growing old
A fear of slowly dying
We took our chance
Like we were dancing our last dance

Our last summer
I still see it all

Our last summer

Morning croissants

Living for the day
Worries far away

The family man, a football fan
And your name is Harry

I thought it could have been something more?
The one thing I adore
Your warm juice
You're nothing but sickness and stink
But by the time you open your eyes
And all your truths have turned to lies
For all the bullshit inside your head
Its all so simple, you're already fucking dead
You pay with your life

You left me here as I fall apart
You stripped me of everything that I love
Lost in your embrace as you tear through my heart
Now you've got everything that I love

These aching pains
That hunger in my veins
The voices in my head
I'm never going back
Never going back
Never going back
Never going back
Back
Back
I'm never going back

You left me here as I fall apart
You stripped me of everything that I love
Lost in your embrace as you tear through my heart
Now I have nothing, I have nothing
I'm drifting away while you tear through my heart
Now you've got everything that I love
I love
I love
I love
I'm never going back
Never going back
Never going back
Never going back",Numb,2005

Stepfanie Kramer,"As I walk this land with broken dreams
I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
Maybe, I'm searching though I don't succeed,
but someone look, there's a growing need.
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning;
all that's left is an unhappy ending.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.
I'll be looking ev'ry day;
I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothing's gonna stop me now;
I'll find a way some how.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.

Steph Jones,"Disturbing the peace, okay
We don't die, we multiply 'cuz there's a strength in numbers, baby
So I brought some of my family members here today
To talk to y'all about celebrity chicks
So Ching-a-ling, why don't you go ahead
And start this thing off for, what up?

From the moment she wake up, so Hollywood puttin' on her makeup
Can't save her but it's always a fool to keep her caked up
You ask the chick out, tike the say where you gon' take her
And see the, to Vegas or Cali to see the Lakers

She brought that paper, getting over on Cat's major
This at the Billboard's I seen for real name in the pager
Say what, most of these balls they can't fade her
She stay fly, Dolce Gabbanna and Marc Jacobs

You can catch a Melrose on her shopping spree
Don't have to ask for which she gets what she needs
She don't mess with broke cats, so please have some cheese
Oops, my fault she only mess with celebrities

Celebrity chick, be at the awards in the zone
Celebrity chick, all about them diamonds customs
Celebrity chick, they have to keep them small world steps on
Celebrity chicks, celebrity chicks

Celebrity chick, be at the awards in the zone
Celebrity chick, all about them diamonds customs
Celebrity chick, they have to keep them small world steps on
Celebrity chicks, celebrity chicks, celebrity chick

She got a loan and can't pay the rest
So she got another brother writing a check
I'm talking if she want it bad enough, she will get it glad enough
She can run it, run it at the same time standing in place

And got a long list of giving me
And who will be buying tables man, I'm out of here
But it's to late now, she can see I'm paid now
That I can make it rain now, say now I think I lost a girl

You can catch a Melsrose on her shopping spree
Don't have to ask for which she gets what she needs
She don't mess with broke cats so please have some cheese
Oops, my fault she only mess with celebrities

Celebrity chick, be at the awards in the zone
Celebrity chick, all about them diamonds customs
Celebrity chick, they have to keep them small world steps on
Celebrity chicks, celebrity chicks, celebrity chick

I see some celebrity chicks everywhere that I be
Everywhere that I've been, the selection or celebrity chicks to see
I see Meeg and I see Mia, I be wantin' to meet 'em
I can see them in the sheets when I imagine me between 'em

I'm straight up off the streets the MC
And I've been waiting to see Heaf
So I could shred it to him rough ride
And I leave it to the back seat of the Beamer

And hear that heatin' and give lil' mama the reason
To send papa to a region, as hot as a pot steamin'
I wanna be the secret that me and Trina keepin'
I'm hood enough for the girl I keep and every toe I Keisha

Good lord Jesus, she can go and pet the jeezer
I just want it for the weekend
I got the power to be 'bout it, I'm not a weakling
I'm trying to fly out to see Jessica Alba in bikini's

Big Smallworld, Ludacris, Steph Ginga
Holla at us when you see us, if you want us, how I need us

You can catch a Melsrose on her shopping spree
Don't have to ask for which she gets what she needs.
She don't mess with broke cats, so please have some cheese
Oops, my fault she only mess with celebrities

Celebrity chick, be at the awards in the zone
Celebrity chick, all about them diamonds customs

That's right, we don't die, we multiply
Strength in numbers baby we just gettin' started

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

Stephan Raab,"Ich erzähl' euch die Geschichte von einer, die ihr kennt
Sie lebt in der Glotze auf weißem Pergament
Sie ist orange und größer als ein kleiner Elefant
Und schon das ganz allein macht die Sache interessant
Habt ihr sie erkannt, wisst ihr wen ich meine?
Lang ist die Nase und kurz sind die Beine
Sie ist ein Star, sie hat den Bogen raus
Meine Damen und Herren, hier kommt die Maus!

Sie weiß Bescheid, die Maus, die kleine süße Maus
Wie kommt der Saft in die Tüte und wie kommt er wieder raus?
Warum hat der Käse Löcher und der Käsekuchen nicht
Und warum brennt auch nachts im Kühlschrank das Licht?
Wie kommt die Wurst in die Pelle und wo kommt die Pelle her
Und warum mag die kleine Maus den Elefanten so sehr?
Die Antwort bekommst du, direkt zu dir nach Haus
Mach die Glotze an, denn hier kommt die Maus!

Hey, hier kommt die Maus, hier kommt die Maus!
Hey, hier kommt die Maus, hier kommt die Maus!
Hey, hier kommt die Maus, hier kommt die Maus!
Hier kommt die Maus, Hier kommt die Maus!

Hey ihr werdet es nicht glauben, doch ich habe es gesehen
Wie die Maus und ihre Freunde sich im Kreis drehen
Käpt'n Blaubär steht am Mikrophon, die Maus bläst den Kamm
Der Elefant tütet mit dem Rüssel wie er kann
Dann tobt die ganze Bude, alle hüpfen in die Höh':
Der Maulwurf, der Eisbär, und rufen laut „okay“
Hein Blöd auf der Bühne bittet um Applaus
Meine Damen und Herren: hier kommt die Maus!

Hey, hier kommt die Maus, hier kommt die Maus!
Hey, hier kommt die Maus, hier kommt die Maus!
Hey, hier kommt die Maus, hier kommt die Maus!
Hier kommt die Maus, hier kommt die Maus!

Schmeiß der Fernseh an: hier kommt die Maus!
Schmeiß der Fernseh an: hier kommt die Maus!
Schmeiß der Fernseh an: hier kommt die Maus!
Schmeiß der Fernseh an: hier kommt die Maus!
Hier, hier, hier kommt die Maus

Die Party geht ab, alle wirken wie verrückt
Hein Blöd, Käpt'n Blaubär und die Anderen sind entzückt
Die Maus nagt zufrieden an einem Stückchen Käse
Hein Blöd und die Jungs machen eine Polonäse
Die kleine, gelbe Ente watschelt lustig durch den Saal
Von vorne nach hinten und das Ganze noch einmal
Der Elefant tütet noch mal einen aus dem Rüssel raus
Dankeschön, hier kommt die Maus!

Hey, hier kommt die Maus, hier kommt die Maus!

Doch du hast nicht auf mir gehört

Sogar zum Frühstück wird gelacht

And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing (swinging) cheek to cheek
Oh I love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he, turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

I'm as awkward as a camel, that's not the worst,
My two feet haven't met yet,
But I'll be teacher's pet yet,
'Cause I'm gonna learn to dance or burst.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Stéphane Grappelli,"They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
""Something here inside
Cannot be denied""

They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You don't realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed and I gaily laughed
To think they would doubt my love
Yet today, my love has flown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
""When a lovely flame dies,
Smoke gets in your eyes.""",Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,1987
Stéphane Grappelli,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais

Stéphane Grappelli,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1988
Stéphane Grappelli,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland

In a phrase how I feel

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon

Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

Stéphane Grappelli,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire

Stéphane Grappelli,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

All through the night,
I delight in your love,

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

Sounds like an old sweet love tune
Say that there soon will be a honeymoon
 
It's three o'clock in the morning
We've danced the whole night through
And daylight soon will be dawning
Just one more waltz with you
That melody so entrancing
Seems to be made for us two
 I could just keep on dancing forever dear with you

Stéphane Grappelli,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,

Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell

Dreaming of you is sweet,
Someday again we'll meet.
 

",Farewell Blues,2001
Stéphane Grappelli,"You took my kisses and you took my love
You taught me how to care
Am I to be just the remnant of a one-sided love affair?
All you took, I gladly gave
There's nothing left for me to save

All of me why not take all of me
Can't you see I'm no good without you
Take my lips I want to lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them

How can I go on dear without you

You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me",All of Me,2001
Stéphane Grappelli,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,2001

That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,

That makes reformers reform reforms

Little pleasures they will share

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.

Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,2003

And through the room reindeers dance and fly
That's baby's first Christmas lullaby

Charlotte wakes when she hears the croons
Of candy canes and singing spoons
Hush, Amanda, now don't you weep
Your dolls will sing you back to sleep
Then
Santa comes with Rudolph too
And here's a special gift they bring to you
And you can sing it if you try
That's baby's first Christmas lullaby

The Christmas tree begins to sway
And all the toy balloons just seem to say
Don't let the music pass you by
It's baby's first Christmas lullaby
Then
Tweedle dumb and tweedle dee
Are harmonizing 'neath the tree
The mistletoes let out a sigh
They're telling you, you must not cry

Join with me in this Christmas song
And you'll feel good if you can sing along
So sing it loud and don't be shy

Que nos plaies se referment

About a half a glass left for the road
Here's a toast to the time we were lovers---then I'll go
Should I laugh, or should I cry
Love you, hate you, live or die

Is my heart half full or half empty
Is our love like the wine in this glass
You drink like there's no tomorrow
So sure, it will always last
Will the memories tase sweet as they linger
Or the bitterness stay on my tongue
Is my heart half full of the love you gave me
Or my heart half empty cuz your love is gone

Your bags are all packed in the hallway
The boxes are stacked on the lawn
You kiss me goodbye just like always
And you're gone
Trembling hands or nerves of steel
Someone tell me what to feel

Is my heart half full or half empty
Is our love like the wine in this glass
You drink like there's no tomorrow

Not a clue about love under the moon

And she's talked to all her friends

Half the moon is shining tonight
And half the moon is pitch black
And I got half a chance that you might
Turn around and come back

And half my love is seeing the light
And half my love is still blind
And keeps on thinking tomorrow
You'll change your mind

Half our hearts were doing just fine
And half our hearts were in doubt
Half the time while walking the line
I ended up stepping out

Half my prayers were praying to God
Half my prayers were to you
Tonight it looks like the answers are overdue

And I am feeling just how hard
Half the moon can pull
I swear my heart might crack in two
If that moon were full

Half the moon is shining tonight
And half the moon's up and gone
You must have taken half of its light
To find the road that you're on

Her mama bought her a hopechest
To keep her dreams inside
All the precious memories
Little things she'd like to hide
A magic wand, an old rag doll
Some plastic pearls 'cause after all

A little girl is only a little girl so long
And tender hearts need their stars to wish upon
'Cause one day you will turn around and she'll be gone
A little girl is only a little girl so long

One day when she got home from school
She slipped a little note
Beneath the tattered lining
And here is what he wrote
""Roses are red, violets are blue""
""Put an X in the box if you like me too""

A little girl is only a little girl so long
And tender hearts need their stars to wish upon
'Cause one day you will turn around and she'll be gone
A little girl is only a little girl so long

They married in the garden on a perfect July day
In a horse and carriage they waved and rode away
Mama went inside to put away her wedding dress
And spotted a letter lying on the old hopechest

It said...
A little girl is only a little girl so long
Your lonely heart might need a star to wish upon
So look inside once in a while to bring the memories home
A little girl is only a little girl
And I will always be your little girl...
So long",The Hopechest Song,1996

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Stephanie Davis,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",He's Funny That Way,1996
Stephanie Davis,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Takin' a Chance on Love,1996
Stephanie Davis,"A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking to market one day
She stopped for a rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay
A few moments passed till she saw it
For it's feathers were covered with sand
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand

She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time

Now the Christmas Eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the townfolk brought presents
To lay by the manger that night
There were diamonds and incense and perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring

She waited till just before midnight
So no one could see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him

Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
Maria, what brings you to me
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door, let me see
Though she trembled, she did as he asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new

Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king

Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offering was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song",The Gift,1998
Stephanie Davis,"There's a fire burning bright 
At our house tonight 
Slow music playing 
And soft candlelight 
On her lips I keep tasting 
The warm red wine 
I'm there in her arms 
But it's all in my mind 

The snow is piled high on the highway tonight 
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white 
Eighteen wheels anchored somewhere out of Dover 
I wish I could hold her 
Instead of huggin' this old cold shoulder 

This old highway 
Is like a woman sometimes 
She can be your best friend 
But she's the real jealous kind 
She's the lady that leads me 
To the life I dream of 
She's the mistress that keeps me 
From the ones that I love 
The snow is piled high on the highway tonight 
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white

Stephanie Davis,"Our guardian star lost all his glow 
The day that I lost you
He lost all his glitter the day you said, ""no"" 
And his silver turned to blue
Like him I am doubtful that our love is true
But if you decide to call on me
Ask for Mister Blue
I stay at home at night
Right by the phone at night
But you won't call and I won't hurt my pride
Call me Mister
I won't tell you 
While you paint the town 
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm painting it too
But I'm painting it blue
Call me Mister Blue
Call me Mister Blue",Mr. Blue,2000
Stephanie Davis,"Like birds on a high lane
They line up at night time at the bar
They all once were lovebirds
Now bluebirds are all that they are
They landed in hell
The minute they fell from love's sky
And now they hope in the wine
That they'll find a new way to fly
A new way to fly
Far away from goodbye
Above the clouds and the rain
The memories and the pain
And the tears that they cry
Now the lesson's been learned
They've all crashed and burned
But they can leave it behind
If they could just find
A new way to fly
By the end of the night
They'll be high as a kite once again
And they don't seem to mind all the time
Or the money they spend
It's a high price to pay
To just find a way to get by
But it's worth every dime
If they can find a new way to fly
A new way to fly
Far away from goodbye
Above the clouds and the rain
The memories and the pain
And the tears that they cry
Now the lesson's been learned
They've all crashed and burned

A new way to fly
They'll leave it behind
As soon as they find

Stephanie Davis,"Three thirty in the morning 
Not a soul in sight 
The city's lookin' like a ghost town 
On a moonless summer night 
Raindrops on the windshield 
There's a storm movin' in 
He's headin' back from somewhere 
That he never should have been 
And the thunder rolls 
And the thunder rolls 

Every light is burnin' 
In a house across town 
She's pacin' by the telephone 
In her faded flannel gown 
Askin' for miracle 
Hopin' she's not right 
Prayin' it's the weather 
That's kept him out all night 
And the thunder rolls 
And the thunder rolls

And the lightnin' strikes 
Another love grows cold 
On a sleepless night 
As the storm blows on 
Out of control 
Deep in her heart 
The thunder rolls 

She's waitin' by the window 
When he pulls into the drive 
She rushes out to hold him 
Thankful he's alive 
But on the wind and rain 
A strange new perfume blows 
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes 
And he knows that she knows 
And the thunder rolls 
And the thunder rolls

Stephanie Davis,"This ain't comin' from no prophet,
Just an ordinary man.
When I close my eyes,
I see the way this world shall be
When we all walk hand in hand.
When the last child cries for a crust of bread,
When the last man dies for just words that he said,
When there's shelter over the poorest head,
We shall be free.
When the last thing we notice is the color of the skin,
And the first thing we look for is the beauty within;
When the skies and the oceans are clean again,
Then we shall be free.
We shall be free, we shall be free.
Stand straight, walk proud,
'Cause we shall be free.
When we're free to love anyone we choose,
When this world's big enough for all different views,
When we all can worship from our own kind of pew,
Then we shall be free.
We shall be free, we shall be free
Have a little faith, hold out,
'Cause we shall be free.
And when money talks for the very last time,
And nobody walks a step behind;
When there's only one race,
And that's mankind, then we shall be free.
We shall be free ,we shall be free
Stand straight, (walk proud,)
Have a little faith, (hold out;)
We shall be free.
We shall be free, we shall be free,
(Stand straight,) stand straight,
(Have a little faith,) walk proud,

But Lord, this one beats all
The wind ain't quit for weeks now
And the drifts are ten feet tall

Closer in to lower ground

'Bout the ones the wolves pulled down

Stopped today to say goodbye

The last few years were just too dry
And I promised that I'd visit
When they found a place in town

'Bout the ones the wolves pull down

On those of us who fall behind
And when we stumble in the snow
Could you help us up while there's still time
Well, I don't mean to be complainin'

And I know you got your reasons
For each and every thing you do

Again only in our minds
Filling up the time we lost
Before we said goodbye

We are daydreamers, we are invincible
And we're mad from all the longing, we feel
You'll find us in the garden just imagining it's real
Growing in silence and watered by tears
Flowers like fingers are holding us here

The half moon has a tale to tell
Of what she has become
What was new, was torn in two
But time will bring the sun

We are daydreamers, we are invincible
And we're mad from all the longing, we feel
You'll find us in the garden just imagining it's real
Growing in silence and watered by tears
Flowers like fingers are holding us here

Your pain was my pleasure your sorrow my joy I fear now I've lost you to health and good cheer

Anyone who'd listen and a few who couldn't care still I welcomed you with open arms my love I did share

Gin and pints of beer I fell for you my darling dear

You shut me off then you showed me the door
But you always came crawlin' back beggin' me for more
I showed you kindness a stool and a tab
Then you poured me my pain in a dirty glass
Yeah you left him bloody battered penniless and poor
You know I often stopped to wonder how he made through my door
With my brothers new non-duplicate registry I.D. 
Well you bit off more than you could chew the first day you met me

Stephanie Grappelly,"Clouds are only dewdrops that once kissed a rose
Clouds are feathers from a lady's fan
Do you remember how we watched them drifting by
Long ago when love began
 
Clouds floating thru the night 
While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye
The night was young
The breeze was warm and tender
A fool was I but how was I to know
I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go 
Like snowhite clouds floating through the night 
Speaking of a love that was heavenly 
A love that could never be mine
 
Once we were together and now we're apart
Did you find it easy to forget?
I keep on dreaming while the years go drifting by
Calling you my ""Sweet Regret""
 
Clouds floating thru the night 
While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye

But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?
