King Tuff,"Stuck in traffic on my way
To no particular place
No agenda, no master plan
No important dates

No reason to be alive at all
As far as I can tell
Except for one small detail
Like a distant ringing bell

And it keeps on calling out to me
Like a lost forgotten lover
So I blast off down the shoulder
To go looking for the other

Driving up the coast
Past the surfers and the seals
All them lonely rich folks
Who only know how to steal

Science can cure sickness
But what can cure my soul
It won't be long before I'm gone
Laying in some hole

So I find an ancient payphone
To tell my mother I love her
But she ain't home
She must have gone out looking for the other

Pull up off the highway
The moon is looking wicked good
I throw my keys into the breeze
And get lost in the woods

I think about my old man
And the mystery of time
When suddenly between the trees
I see the lake of fire

So I jump right in
And take a swim
In this pool of unknown colours
And as I swim I begin to brim with visions of the other

Found my car a few days later
After I came to
Her name was Blue Subaru 1982

I punched the clutch
And kick the gas
And take off in a burst
Well it wasn't long before the gas was gone
And we were overcome from thirst

So we found a dusty truckstop
Above the vultures hovered
And I thought it was the end
But then I thought again
And that was when I took the hand of the other",The Other,2018

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

King's Road,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Last Rose of Summer,

There should I see what is pleasant to me,
A mischief light on them entic'd me away!


I like not the court, nor the city resort,
Since there is no fancy tor sucn maids as me;
Their pomp and their pride I can never abide,
Because with my humor it does not agree.


How oft have I been in the Westmoreland green,
Where the young men and maidens resort for to play,
Where we with  delight, from morning till night,
Could feast it and frolic on each holiday.


The ewes and their lambs, with the kids and their dam:
To see in the country how finely they play;
The bells they do ring, and  the birds they do sing,
And the fields and the gardens are pleasant and gay.

We there with our lovers did use for to dance;
Then hard hap had I, my ill fortune to try,
And so up to London, my steps to advance.

If I to the city my mind could but frame;
But I'll have a lad that is North Country bred,

Until my own country again do I see,
For here in this place I shall ne'er  see  the face

Rememb'ring my brothers, my  sisters, and others,
In less than a year I hope to return.

King's Singers,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1989
King's Singers,"Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night

You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hang in empty halls
Frame less heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

And now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

Of others take a sheaf, of me a grain. 

Within this pack pins, points, laces and gloves,

The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, 
It's a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.

A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho' she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer, 
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

I said be careful his bow tie is really a camera

We smoked the last one an hour ago
So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine

In colors on the snowy linen land

Weathered faces lined in pain 
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

For one as beautiful as you

Frameless heads on nameless walls 
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

It all works out
It all works out
It all works out

I'm waiting for a word beyond our history
And paper tigers dance about within the mystery
Clover of substance I can't put my finger on
And stepping over sidewalk cracks I'm catching the last one

The silent waiting room, the padded soundproof wall
Have become much more terrifying than the shadowed hall
So you can have your reasons for the bloody war
I know I don't want to hate you for what you're not sorry for

Kill the king
Strip the queen
Are you a friend
Dear Charlie Sheen

Roll over Johnny boy
Your song is on the tube
And with it died a dream of mine...
Releasing the balloon
It seems that lately nothing that I ever thought
Can stand up to the pressure of the crap that I have bought
So turn the page and be sure that you rip it out
'Cause it won't be there otherwise unless we figure out
That there are reasons yet behind this bloody war
And I don't want to hate you for what you're not sorry for

Kill the king Strip the queen
Are you my friend
Dear Charlie Sheen

I love you forever, I curse the bad weather
In militant marsh mellow fields

Stuck in the pages so long
Attracted a loser, a practiced confuser

River of Tears
After it's over
And after the years are passing
Never asking
What about miracles
Faith in the space
It keeps me guessing
With nothing to hate
I am lonely
And unholy

Everything matters
A prayer when you're scared
Boarded up windows
And broken down chairs before morning
Heard it storming
(God can you hear me...
God can you see me cry...die)
Handbook of rituals... hands in the air
More than a give up... big as a care
If you're daring
And you're sharing

Move me
God, can you hear me cry
God, can you see me die
God can you move me
Move me and move me again

Out of the planet and into the silence
Over the mountains in search of a crisis to find me
If it should be
Once I was told there's a race to be won
Pointed the finger straight into the sun to be blinded and I minded
(God can you hear me...
God can you see me cry...die)
Wish I could whisper how much I need you
After tomorrow I might forget to
If it's only from a story
Keeper of mysteries

Had the devil on my mind
Two dimensional Satan on the wall
And the thread would start to wind

Hold me closer
Move aside Mr. Wilson
Please move aside

In the sand the circle getting bigger
Till it all gets out of hand
On the mountain.. let go of the angel
And to my mom I ran

Hold me closer

Any day.. yesterday.. there's tomorrow to say
Let's forget it anyway
Can you try to understand...
What's this mark upon my hand

My nose was held shut and my mouth open
With a spoon shoved down my throat
One little piggy walking with a pumpkin
And a mustard headed goat

Hold me closer
Please move aside Mr. Wilson
Would you please move aside

Hey Betty May, it's summertime in Jersey
Don't you know the kids will freeze
Please don't pop your eyes out for me deary
Cause the man behind you sees

Hold me closer

Anyday... yesterday... there's tomorrow to say
Let's forget it anyway
Can you try to understand...
What's this mark upon my hand?

At the bottom of a box of five black markers
Is a buried Swedish pen
If at Thanksgiving... if you want to see me
Then you better be my kin

Hold me closer
For the love of god, Mr. Wilson
For the love of god

Anyday... yesterday... there's tomorrow to say

Would you sing a song for me

When you're scared

Faking your friends

Everything's taken away

Will I mistake it
If she hands me my head on a plate
How will I take it
If I'm scared

It's really easy to take all the blame
When you're scared
All of your ornaments fall to the floor
When you're scared

All the decisions to make
All of your life is at stake
Under your feet there's a quake

If she gives me a sword and a lake
Will I mistake it
If she hands me my head on a plate
How will I take it?
If I'm scared

And its your life that you hate
Nothing is easy to take

When she hands me my head on a plate
Then will I break it?

And you're scared to death you're wrong,
If you're past the point of turning back

High on giving up
Sliding down the mountain
Drowning in the mud

It happened all so fast

It's obvious, the harmony is already gone
Can't go back, we're wasting time the deed is done
See you later, I don't need you hanging on

Too late, I know your name
We just have lost the spark you played, heavyweight
Much too late, there is no more time, you know
You're not so precious, that I can't let go

Constantly assuring me that I'm the one
While you telling others what a fool I am
Now you finally figuered out, that you were wrong
Can't undo the scars, but now the pain is gone

The well is dry, time to say good bye
You did me wrong, thought I play along
I want out, now, cause you're not what I need
Get away, get away, no one like you is gonna make me bleed

'til I figured out, which way I should go
Knowing the way, it sure ain't enough
But having found you, I've changed so much

Rather later, then never at all
I drop my defenses, catch my fall
I'm praying to God, that you're the one
The perfect match, my fear is gone

Nothing else matters, I'll give up control
The time I've wasted, If only I had known
Here I surrender, take my heart
Forever with you, in peace and love

So innocent and true
An everlasting love

They wrapped him up so warm and tight and said
It looks like heaven's come down

There was a new star shining in the sky up above
By its light that winter night
They found peace and perfect love
If we want to find it, I know we always will
For that new star is shining for us still

He worried how to feed him on the trade that was all he knew
It was hard enough to make ends meet when they were only two
But the cold, the dark and hunger couldn't take away their joy
And she knew that they would find a way
For their precious baby boy

Can make you see and feel

In the thick of a forest without a road

I've seen the smartest lookin' fall into the grips of a trap

But killin' myself is foolish
Though I contemplate existence, a nigga never gon' do it

With the fire in my bones, and the sweet taste of kerosene
I get lost in the light, so high don't wanna come down
To face the loss of the good thing, that I have found

In the dark of the night I can hear you calling my name
With the hardest of hearts I still feel full of pain
So I drink and I smoke and I ask you if your ever around
Even though it was me who drove us right in the ground

See the time we shared it was precious to me
But all the while I was dreaming of revelry

Gonna run baby run like a stream down a mountainside
With the wind at my back I won't ever even bat an eye
Just know it was you all along who had a hold of my heart
But the demon in me was the best of friends from the start

So the time we shared it was precious to me

Everything came tumbling down on me

Like holding my hand
When I'm low, you let me know
You always understand

",I Love the Way You Love,1964
Kings of Rhythm Orchestra,"We've been putting each other
Through a hard time
And it's a mighty good feeling to 
Know we're gonna work it out 
It's gonna work out
Yeah, it's gonna work out fine

Take a look at the way it's going now
Makes you want to give a sigh of relief
You know the last thing I ever
Wanted to do
Was to give you any grief
I guess it was a situation
That was bound to come up someday
But our feeling for each other won out
And I'm oh so glad to say

We've been putting each other
Through a hard time
And it's a mighty good feeling to 
Know we're gonna work it out 
It's gonna work out
Yeah, it's gonna work out fine 

Even the best of relationships
Run the risk of going awry
There's a lot two people who care
about each other
Can do to make each other cry
Ain't it funny how it took a reunion
To help us to really see
With each other is the only way we can ever be

We've been putting each other
Through a hard time
And it's a mighty good feeling to 
Know we're gonna work it out 
It's gonna work out

You got to learn to accept it, feels like I've been neglected 
All these bands coming out and they sound alright 
All these videos on tv and they look alright 
I spent my whole life spilling my guts between the lines 
Putting in more work than you will ever know than when I rhyme 
Tryin to press the people so I can reach the masses 
Give them what they want with this pen that's plastic (Life)
I got a message I'm a put it in a bottle 
Sign the bottom of the paper and let the whole world swallow 
Today can be tomorrow, ain't no telling when I'm leaving 
I'm a rock this microphone even when I'm barely breathin' 
When you start sleepin, D-loc starts creepin 
When you actin a fool, D-loc's always thinking 
Be clever when you play me because it's comin back to hull 
I can feel my heats rising and it's pissin me off 
And when it's pissin me off I got no choice 
But to crack snap back at you like a chain reaction

You better think before you speak on the mic or get knocked out 
It's been a minute and your shit better stop 
Bring your punk ass back to Cali, bitch ass get popped 
You ain't never in Cali, wonder why they don't accept you 
Your sound's getten flopped, plus you got a fuckin attitude

Life's a constant struggle 

I was never really understood, had a lot of misunderstandings 
Not too many saw my plan, so it left me standing in my own two shoes 
Now what the fuck was I suppose to do? 
Givin a fight, be a man or take my life 
To make ends meet I did more wrongs than rights
Couldn't hold a job, I can't handle being bossed
In and out of rehabs, from border schools I was tossed 
Started hanging with the wrong crowd 
Caught slanging by my pops and got thrown out 
On my own once again I had to make it happen 
That's just a little of my life before I started rappin' 
But I always kept in touch with my dog Dustin 
That's the one friend that I never stopped trusting 
Next thing you know I'm living over at his pad 
Me and him and Saint we was workin for his dad 
Drinkin tallboys after work every night 
Takin hits in the garage out of metal pipes 
Working long ass hours no 9 to 5 
But you gotta do what it takes to survive 
That's around the time that we met Daddy X 
And ever since then we've been on a new quest 
Kottonmouth was formed so it began a new chapter 
Of my life that I'm livin til I'm in the after after

Basketball, baseball, rapper, an actor whatever
Whatevers gunna make my life better if it last

Neighbors turn athletes, clothing companies, million dollar factories

Next day wake up imam be your next doc
Cram through the air and hold up the dirt
Keeping up playing if it didn't even hurt
Riding home with my knee and elbow making blood
Know I wanna see moms imam get a lot of love
Never ever know what's up in national news 
Only thing you worry about is the school lunch menus
Eating all the places and being captain of the team
First ten years of life is a beautiful thing

And I can't help it, I'd really like to see 
The day when no one* gets jealous, greedy, cruel 
Or unhappy, bored fucked up or ruined, wimpy, 
Sad, mislead or fooled 
We've got to face it, it's 

Time to grow, time to know 
Time to see in what we believe 
As the time goes by, we'll know that it was on our side 
But come to understand (stand under?) the time 
And you'll realize it's in your mind 

One day we're all gonna laugh about it 
About how easy we are to rule 
To take our innerselves away from us 
And knock, knock, knocking it on up there 
Where we are, blinded with faith in something called ""the only truth !?"" 
No, I can't buy it, I mean how can I believe 
When I see people get jealous, greedy, cruel and 
Unhappy, bored, fucked up and ruined, wimpy, sad, 
Mislead and fooled

Kinky,"I'm walking alone again
With my headphones on
And I don't want this anymore,
To hit the streets without a chord
Now this city is my song
Where I submerge myself
Taking a long walk around the block
Every little step,
Every single step becomes a note
That I draw on the staff lines of the sidewalk

I'm walking alone again, with my headphones on
And I really really wanna run
But at this moment, I'm listening to a very very soft song

I'm walking again alone
With my headphones on
And now I speak and I'm screaming
Because I can't hear my own voice

I'm walking alone again
With my headphones on
I have to walk between smog
Behind sunglasses, inside my clothes

Sometimes,I feel that every simple thing has a sound
And if it does
What kind of shape does the silence have?

Even if the silence is still with me
No one can hear it
Even if the silence walks with me
No one really hears it

Sometimes I feel like everything has a sound
And if it does
What kind of shape does the silence have?
A sparkling new? A pocket size?
A white one? A smoke one?
One that you can use as a tattoo
Or as a flag as an umbrella
To protect you against the rain
Of noise that the city has?
Or maybe it's a package,
Where the secret comes from

Even if the silence is still with me
No one can hear it
Even if the silence walks with me
No one really hears it
Even if the silence is still with me
No one can hear it
Even if the silence is still with me",The Headphonist,2003
Kinky,"Hace 8 noches María José se fue a tomar ala cantina
Un solo trago
Que se convirtió en un botella una botella
Que contiene un litro entero de tequila
Con un gusano en el fondo descansando boca arriba

Ese gusano corono el ultimo trago
Maria José tomo
Justo antes de la despedida
Luego tambaleando hasta su cama
Donde se durmió enseguida
Con el gusano en su vientre navegando en el tequila

Y si el amor te hace soñar
Y si tomar te hace dormir
Y si tu amor se ahoga en alcohol
No vas a despertar jamas

Y si el amor te hace soñar
Y si tomar te hace dormir
Y si tu amor se ahoga en alcohol
No vas a despertar jamas

Y no pudiendo despertar Maria José
Durmió por mas de 7 días
Llego un doctor y contra el mal del sueño
No pudo alguna cura o medicina
Hay que esperar pacientemente a que el mismo
Habra la pupila

Abrió Maria José los ojos hasta quedar 
Completamente despierto despertó y se quito la ropa empezó a pujar
Como preparándose a dar a luz

Y del vientre de Maria Jose nació una 
Enorme y colorida mariposa",Maria Jose,2003

Kinky,"They say dreams enter from the feet
So they recommend bare feet to sleep
If you wants Morpheus with you

They say the trees wear their clothes backwards
In the summer they wear leaf coats
And in the winter they take them off

I'm not afraid of the world, I'm not afraid to roller coster

They say comets are like animals with large and bright tails
And they gallop through the night
They say rugs are just floors with over grown hair
And the broom is the comb, the vacuum is the blow dryer

I sleep and dream well, bare feet during night
I'm a good rider of the comets light but even
Though I believe
I'm a tree I can't stand outside naked with the breeze",Not Afraid,2003

Nos planeaba deborar
Y no hay escape todo mundo
Es bombardeado en la ciudad
Para que un mundo sea perfecto
Hay que quitarle la verdad

Toma bien mi mano
Brinca para acá
Escapemos de las garras
De esta gran ciudad
Busca tu refugio
En mi paladar
Un mundo sin ti
Es una fiera sin domar

Entre las paginas del cuento
Donde tenemos que estar
Estaba escrito mi comienzo
Tu mitad nuestro final
El crucigrama de la vida
Siempre listo a rellenar
Tu eres la tinta, la respuesta
Que me dicta la verdad

I don't want this anymore, to hit the streets without a chord
Now this city is my song where I submerge myself

Taking a long walk around the block
Every little step, every single step becomes a note
That I draw on the staff lines of the sidewalk

I'm walking alone again, with my headphones on again
And I really wanna run but at this moment
I'm listening to a very, very quiet song

I'm walking alone again with my headphones on
And now I speak and I'm screaming
Because I can't hear my own voice

I'm walking alone again with my headphones on
I have to walk between smog, behind sunglasses inside my clothes
Sometimes I feel that every simple thing has a sound
And if it does, what kind of shape does the silence have?

Even if the silence still with me
No one can hear it
Even if the silence walks with me
No one really hears it

Sometimes it seems like everything I see has a sound
And if it does, what is the shape of silence?
A sparkling new? A pocket size?
A white one? A smoke one?

One that is on your arm as a tattoo
Or a waving flag on the back of your car
As an umbrella to protect you against
The rain of noise that the city has?
Or maybe it's just a small envelope with a secret inside

Even if the silence still with me
No one can hear it
Even if the silence walk with me
No one really hears it

'Bout a brave young Indian lad, you should remember well, 
From a tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and peaceful band

He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand. 
But he's just a Pima Indian, no food, no friend, no chance, 
And nobody cared what Ira did and when do the Indians dance. 

Well, Ira took to drinking hard, jail often was his home, 
They used to let him raise the flag there and lower it just like you'd throw a dog a bone. 
And Ira died drunk early one morning all alone in the land he'd fought to save. 
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.

And many a starving farmer he opened up his door.

Amongst the tall grown sugar canes
Lived a simple man and a dominiker hen
And a rose of a different name.

Well, the first time I felt lightning
I was standing in the drizzling rain
With a trembling hand and a bottle of gin
And a rose of a different name.

Well, the devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple headed man
And help me leave that black rose alone.

When the devil made that woman
Lord, she threw the pattern away

She was built for speed with the tools you need
To make a new fool every day.

Way down deep and dirty
On the darker side of shame
I caught a cane cuttin' man with a bottle of gin
With a rose of a different name.

And a scimitar by his side

A thing goin', you know, and they'd been carryin' on

Could hear him talk to his camel as he rode out across the
Dunes, his voice would cut through the still night desert
Air and he'd say (imitate Arabic speech and finish with ""Sold! American)

Well, he brought that camel to a screechin' halt (verbal screeching sound)
In the rear of Fatima's tent

Sipping on a RC co-cola listenin' to her transistor,
Watchin' the Grand Ole Opry on the tube, readin' a Mad
Magazine while she sung, ""Does your chewing gum lose
It's flavor?"" Yeah, Ahab walked up to her and he say,
(imitate Arabic speech), which is Arabic for ""Let's twist
Again like we did last summer, baby.!!"" Ha, ha, ha!!

Kinleys,"There ain?t no easy way to start this conversation
So I?ll just say what?s on my mind
Once our hearts both shared a common destination
To love until the end of time

Lately we?ve been drifting further from each other
Someone?s gotta take the wheel
I won?t wait until it?s too late to recover
So let me tell you how I feel

I?ll do anything if it?ll bring our hearts together
I?ll stand and fight or get down on my knees
If we can fix what?s wrong and just go on in love forever
Baby I?ll be beggin? please

I?m strong enough to handle any situation
But honey true love has no pride
So I can say without a moments hesitation
Before I?ll let you say goodbye

I?ll do anything if it?ll bring our hearts together
I?ll stand and fight or get down on my knees
If we can fix what?s wrong and just go on in love forever
Baby I?ll be beggin? please

Boy you know your love?s my one true weakness
When it comes to you I?m helpless

I?ll do anything if it?ll bring our hearts together
I?ll stand and fight or get down on my knees
If we can fix what?s wrong and just go on in love forever

Caucasian features or cheek bones or cup glass
Ignite the future joined by the past

The blood boils even in the weakest of wanton
Stay strong, help each other along

Writing rhymes, not what fair skin girls do
I just bounce off the sounds and the tones
The beat and the bass make the day last lonely

I dream of the lovely time
Separate sense from the voice in my mind
I get wet thinking hypothetically
Break us wet dreaming, I'm gonna get me

When on the front and back and both sides
Don't mean I don't a get a good from a man right
It's just life loving all kinds
So many beautiful hearts and bright minds

So many ways to click and shoe shine
But it's so outlawed to dig you double time
But the sky is the skin and the eyes are the stars
Live it all, it's just who we are

Those who've got nothing to wait, mount their horses

There are people somewhere and this rule works for them

Kioka Williams,"Round the corner
Turn the corner, turn

Hell is round the corner 
Hot like a sauna
I know I hurt her
When I tell her that I want her
And with this drama
I act like Jeffrey Dahmer
I beat her then I eat her
Nigga's sweet,there's no one sweeter
I think I lost my tweeter
To your pussycats
Do you call your pistols 'gats'?

Don't sleep her love away 
Don't let her run away
Don't sleep her love away
Don't let her

Dream and I'm seein' it
Harmed a girl like Monica
Everyday be like Hanukkah
And change my mind again
Hide off like to find a friend
I call her ""enemy""
She says I act like there's ten of me
A sketch for their clone
A dog without a home
But you want more when I was on tour
Told her ""you should write a lot""
Now look how much time you got
Told you,""shouldn't run a lot""
Now look how much time you got

Take life on the streets- your own
Made by Grease beats- pure dog
Running with the renegades of NY
Street Dog speak the true talk
Want to talk about crime?
Yeah right!
Stick ups- get in mind to realize
Alright
Run the airtime
Fuck the police it's startin' to get hyped
Niggas gettin' paranoid and void
Then imply Tetth's a bad boy
Just gonna rap about kids that can't cope
Dogs get mad when niggas stand broke
With a phat rope, yo, what a joke!
Shit, I had coke and fifty pound notes
Puffed it for those niggas I know
Far as I know you're a freak if I bone
Like I go 
Trix and Milo
I roll with niggas with big machines
Blank sreens, video scenes
Blue, black and green
Niggas with wigs scared the scam clean
And get the cream- know what I mean?
Diggin' the scene with the gasoline
With enough magazines
Them nine to fives,big executives who ride the clock, 
There'll be no crime from nine to five.
There be no crime for none of us
Livin' to find those kinds of drugs
With no undercovers
Those motherfuckers can't flop dogs
In any form, this rough cough's quick
I'm sick
Going where the Jungle is clicking
In England the trans-Atlantic
In Harlem where demands don't quit

Levitating and useless debating 
In these dvastating times

Don't let her run away

While everybody's just doing drugs
And writing melodic rhymes

Don't sleep her love away

Trying to get one 
And not get into trouble
I might just be inclined

Don't let her run away

We all got needs 
We all do dirty deeds
Now and then want to smoke some weed

Don't sleep her love away

Yeah we're free
Yes we need to be free 
Walkin' round with unsatisfying needs

Don't let her run away

Yeah we're free 
Yes we need to be free
Walkin' round with unsatisfying needs

Don't sleep her love away

It's a hangman gettin' my prayer
My hands can slang bang actors
That have the will to gang slang
That's the type of nigga that can't say,
""you don't go and forget the down times
And the walk while I was with the bad man""
Many to fly right?
Master plan
Miracle flight like Pan-Am
Man,damn!
Sure as the echo
'fore that gonna pump the petrol
Niggas with escorts hide in the get-go
Now lay it in the ghetto
Yeah y'all
I could find life in a Paris metro
While I'm walkin' around slammin' ghettos
In the real
Know the rapper with the black girls
Deliverin' travels with the Maxwells
Gettin' paid off girls

Well as drop sales with Stockwell

To barely make ends meet

Foot on the gas, taking off like a rocket

So come on, come on,

I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money

Let's wake the town that never stops sleeping
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money

We can dance in the dark
Blow the speakers out of this car
Light it up, burn it down
Until the morning rolls around

In a field, where we can scream
Get away with almost anything
Yeah, every now and then you gotta raise a little hell
Hope we get lucky and stay out of jail

I’m looking through your window pane
I heard the word, you’re back in town
I’ve got some cheap cigarettes, your favorite beer,

We’ll chase the moon, ride the stars
Find the muscle in this car
I know it’s still got something left
Yeah come on out, take my hand
Feel my heart, girl understand
I gotta thunder pounding in my chest
Hey yeah, can’t see you as nothing but mine
And girl tonight, let's go crazy one more time

We’ll park the car, climb on the hood
Turn it up, when something good starts
Playing through these rusted doors
And in this sticky and sweet hair tonight
I’ll kiss you girl till I get it right
'Cause I know that it'll lead to more

We devour rolling around
Where I’ll gently lay you down
And I’ll try to tell you how I feel
But you place your finger on my mouth
Whisper “Baby, no not now
The night is young and we still got time to steal""
Hey yeah, can’t see you as nothing but mine
And girl tonight, let's go crazy one more time

I watch you fall fast asleep
And this small town sky fade from black to blue
And I’ll wipe the tear from my eye
But you’ll never know cause baby I’ll smile
As I wave goodbye to you
Hey yeah, can’t see you as nothing but mine

When she moved in just down my street
Still don't know what she saw in me

I guess she liked the way I made her laugh
She wanted more than what friends had
She kissed me once and we never looked back

Our sweat made both us shiver
Don't stop, darling they're just rain drops
The moonlight was all around
Our breath, the only sound
Baby, darling she said take me
And drive me crazy

In the woods in my grandpa's barn
In the back seat of my car
She said it don't matter where we are

She made me thirst for a woman's love
I kept drinking, couldn't get enough
Yeah, there was magic in her velvet touch

First time was down by the river
Our sweat made both us shiver
Don't stop, darling they're just rain drops
The moonlight was all around

Serves the best cold draft beer

I blew it all like a damn fool on women and beer
I didn't have the grades but I had myself a major league fastball
Got a call from the minor leagues in Wichita and blew out my arm the first year, yeah

Well, I took a good look at my life and decided I'd make a change
Booked me a flight on an airplane, I was third world Peace Corps bound
But I met me a stewardess waiting right there in the airport bar

Hell maybe I'm way too much about having fun
I'll send you a postcard, send me your love,
Just don't give up on me yet, I'm still growing up

I went to work for my uncle on the coast at a club called the Hot Spot
We took our breaks on the boat docks and I got fired for smoking pot
With the beach right there I guess surfing was the logical next move
But I got mouthy with the wrong dude and got my damn jaw tattooed

Hell maybe I'm way too much about having fun
I'll send you a postcard, send me your love,
Just don't give up on me yet, I'm still growing up, alright

I bought an old guitar with cash from a good hand of blackjack
Learned a few chord from a fat-back, hairy man named Pete
I got a local gig on the weekends in some old honky-tonk
Singing two hours of nothing but Cash songs, and I could always drink for free
And some so called big-wig, producer man started sniffing around
He told me he liked my sound but there was something holding me back
He said a rhinestone suit and a cowboy hat outta do the trick
I told him I had something he could stick, way on up his a**

Could have sworn it was your dark hair
Blowing out the passenger side
I did a double take, couldn't catch my breath
Felt just like a wrecking ball that hit me in the chest
It's like you disappeared, swept out in the tide
How'd you leave without a goodbye

I see I was just another
Sunset fadin' in your eyes
I may never love another
Like my girl of the summer
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh",Girl of the Summer,2015
Kip Moore,"Nights falling on me like a big black coat
Staring through the window at the empty cold
Thick white smoke rolling off my lips

My chest feeling heavy like a cannon ball
Got sweat rolling down me like a waterfall
'Cause I let love slip through my fingertips

Ooh, ooh
Hey, ah
I'm a raging fire, you're my hearts desire

Slipping in and out of a restless sleep
Thinking and wonderin' if you are thinking of me
Or are you long gone girl, holding another man

The thought brings me right up to the brink of rage
Like a lion in rusted out circus cage
I want to break these bars and make you understand

Ooh ooh,
Hey, ah
I'm a raging fire, you're my hearts desire

When I finally settle in to a midnight dream
You're walking through a field of flowers smiling at me
So I reach right out and try to touch your skin

Then a morning breeze blows and I almost taste your sweet scent drippin' on my pillow case
Damn this day, here I go again

Ooh ooh
Hey, ah
I'm a raging fire, you're my hearts desire

I don't think I can really take no more
Like a prize fighter laying on the canvas floor
I hear the clock bell ring struggle to my feet

I've been 52 rounds with your memory
I'd go 52 more if it make you see
Girl you mean the world to me

Ooh ooh
Hey, ah
I'm a raging fire, your my hearts desire

Ooh ooh
Hey, ah

Even when I was a kid
It sounded like another trick
To put us all to bed
With just a story they read

Yeah, Houdini might escape
And then he'll vanish from the scene
Baby that was smoke and mirrors
And this is you and me
I don't know what to think

Now your hand does something to my skin
Make me want you more and believe again

Oh give me some of that magic, magic
Baby, oh, oh
You know I gotta have it, have it
It's the way you look when you want me close
When your hair falls down raining glitter and gold
Oh give me some of that magic, magic baby

It wants you to strike a flame
Ignite a full-on fire
Girl you got me burning
So take me a little higher
I wanna walk that wire

Stop the hands of time
Forever right here
Don't leave me blind baby
'Cause my only fear
Is that you'll disappear

Kip Moore,"Me and Teddy used to burn that old Chevy
All the way up to Mary Lee's
One of the guy's a kinda ride or die
And we were thick as thieves
The whole damn town said when we come around
We're mean as a four letter word
Up to no good fun, no we didn't have much
Just a whole lotta time to burn

So if we got high, we got stoned
If there was a fire, we got it on
If there was a backseat, we made love
That was then and that was us

We crossed the county line for a kegger one night
There were some girls we had never seen
Teddy had his eye locked on a dime
Mary said she was lookin' at me
Standin' there sippin' on smoke
And a cheap ass bottle of rum
She said ""My name's Kate, you're my kinda crazy
And it takes one to know one""

So if we got high, we got stoned
If there was a fire, we got it on
If there was a backseat, we made love
That was then and that was us

Mary Lee started hangin', started talkin'
With a boy with a checkered past
It wasn't long before he showed his true colors
And he left her all blue and black
Cops stopped us runnin' ninety
With a loaded pistol and a bottle of booze
And it's a good damn thing the blue lights
Got us 'fore we did what we's gon' do

So if we got high, we got stoned
If there was a fire, we got it on
If there was a backseat, we made love
That was then and that was us

If we got high, yeah you know we gonna roll it up

Still taste the whiskey, still fresh on my mouth
Hot cup of coffee, smoke in my hand
Another day in the life of the guitar man
La de da

Well last night was a good night as I reached in my jeans
Crumpled up ones, a few tens in between
And a red head named Annie, she's still fast asleep
Made me make her a promise, she knows I can't keep
La de da

Time to fire up that two tone bucket of rust
Throw my amp and my case in the back of my truck
Breathing my freedom, windows rolled down
Forty-six miles till the next nameless town
La de da

Well, the place is still empty when I walk in the door
Stench from the beer, spilling up through the floor
Give an eye to sweet Lisa, she mixes the drinks
Life's been hard on her, but she's been good to me
La de da

Off in the shadows
Stands a stool and a stage
Where many souls before me were put on display
I take one last breath, time to pay some more dues
That won't add up to nothing but tips and cheap booze

Yeah, the fruits of my labor is when the crowd sings along
Nothing short of a savior, still I go home alone
I'm an empty, faceless spotlight mike-stand
I'll getcha high, I'll getcha low
I'm the guitar man

Well they'll ask for more love songs and I'll play with a smile
To help them hold on or forget for a while
They can fill up that jukebox with a week's worth of pay
But it can't fill their happy and it can't fill their pain

No drums, no pianos, no sweet harmonies
It's all in a song and it's all on me
Won't find nothing fancy I'm a tired one man band
I'm the picking and grinning guitar man

Well I had me a pretty baby, thought she was the one
But she soon grew tired, this love on the run
Said she felt second, told me I had to choose
She's back in Georgia and I'm there with you

The end of the night, we'll all be best friends
Then strangers till I roll through town again
I'll yell out hey Lisa something cold in a can

I thought we had enough
Then again, what do I know?

I turned and cut off the porch light
Dried my blue eyes and climbed upstairs
I found her bottle of brandy, nose candy everywhere
Sat down and stared at a snapshot of Boston hanging by the books
I thought man she'd paint some pretty picture, but damn those colors sure do rub

And I'm all out of money

Waitin' for the sun to shine

Took all the pennies I had
Threw 'em in the wishing well
And I wish you well

As you're walkin', out the door

What you're feelin', I'm feelin' too

Hold on, to the dreams that we had

Miles away
No, you're never turnin' back
And I just can't wait anymore

Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most
You were miles away

When times were tough, and you were down and out
Who was there by your side?
But now you've gone, I'm so tired of bein' alone
With only your promises

The lonliness just fades away,
And thoughts of you, just memories
No cryin' now, for what we're missin'
Time won't forget what you meant to me

If you hold me, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we've had

I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of fire
These dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire
This desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
And as she turns
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
I realise that nothing's as it seems
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of rain
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes, this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of her love
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

When I'm dippin on the grind I get my money quick
But sometimes I wanna lay up wit my honey dip
She be wit me cause she aint like all them other chicks
Let you hit, then she split, that's why I got a honey dip
From the club to the telly you know how it is
Most of the chicks I never tell em where a nigga live
Tryna reach me at my mansion or my mother crib
Hit my cell, hit my two, now I'm at my honey dips

Yo we talked about 8, said I was comin thru to hit
Now its wee hours in the mornin and I'm drunker than a bitch
Stumblin and shit, I jumped up in the whip
Flipped open the horn like where's my honey dip
And bitch fuck ya man tonite, you know my steelo
Sizzurp wit the Cristal, the corners playin cee-lo
You see me well you jus smile you know we on the le-low
I'm whippin thru the town like we boilin up a kilo
Huh, I'm tryna dip up in the tele
Dip up in the room, then dip up in her belly
Dip off on Pirelli's, Dip-Sets Fonzarelli
My white t-shirt, lookin dip up in my Pelle
Smokin weed up in the Range
Full speed left lane
Its me against the world, M.O.B. up in my vein
Wit another nigga girl, gettin low to give me brain

I aint on some hubby shit

How a slugger jus slide up thru the check in

Hundred diamonds on my neck and wrist shit

Watch how I do this stupid grindin and perfectin
Who's flyer when I step in got em spyin every second, cause that 06

Hit the road shake the State Troopers off for daddy
And she bring all that paper back
No short paper back, she sure don't play wit that

[Chorus]",Honey,2007
Kippi Brannon,"Daddy, take me with you
I promise I'll be good
Daddy, it's next time
And Mama said I could

Sitting in the front seat
Riding downtown
For an ice cream cone
I'd wrap him around
My little fingers
Tighter than my baby curls

You can make a tear go
A long, long way when you're
Daddy's little girl
Walking down the isle
My eyes on Mr. Right

My bouquet was shaking
But Daddy held on tight
Taking those last steps
Daddy and me, from the child
To the woman I'd be

With a diamond on my finger
And my mama's string of pearls
He gave me away, 'cause I couldn't stay
Daddy's little girl

Well, he taught me my bible
From seven to thirteen
Taught me to drive
When I was a wild thing

I reached and he prayed
When I made some mistakes
That I wouldn't have made
If I'd've done it his way

Now he hugs me when he sees me
We talk about the past
He tries to give me money
And I try to give it back

He's a book of advice
More than I need
The look in his eyes
As he's saying to me

Let me help you while I can
While I'm still in this world
What will you do when your Daddy's gone
And you're Daddy's little girl

What'll I do when my daddy's gone

",Daddy's Little Girl,1997
Kippie Moeketsi,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me",1999
Kippie Moeketsi,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,1999
Kippington Lodge,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more 

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more",In My Life,1998

Spinnin' my hair around my finger

You call just to tell me that you're missing me
And we end up talking all night long cuz we've got a lot to say

Kira Isabella,"It was Friday night and the lights were shinning
Everyone was sitting in the stands
He was being scouted by a big time college
She played trumpet in the marching band
In the parking lot, when the game was over
She had a bus to ride
When he pulled up in his buddy's truck
And the door swung open wide

He was the quarterback
Smile at her, imagine that
How do you explain the star of the game
And the no name girl from the freshman class

She got out at a bonfire party
Never had a drink before
But he held it to her lips and she took her first sip
And before she knew it, she had three more

She always heard that a girls first time,
Is a memory she'll never forget
She found out the hard way about love
When she saw those pictures on the internet

He was the quarterback
Smile at her, imagine that
Who you gonna blame the star of the game
Or the no name girl in the freshman class
He was the quarterback
Smile at her, imagine that
Who you gonna blame, the star of the game
Or the no name girl in the marching band

Oooh-Oooh

Monday morning when the word got out
Everybody picked a side
He had the school and the whole town too
And she had nothing but the truth inside

He was the quarterback
Smile at her, imagine that
Who you gonna blame, the star of the game
Or the no name girl in the freshman class
He was the quarterback
Lied to her, imagine that
He was the quarterback
She was in the freshman class

Verse:
I`ve just finished writing an advertisement
Calling for a boy.
No half-hearted Romeo or flirt is meant;
That`s the kind I won`t employ.
Though anybody interested can apply,
He must know a thing to qualify.
For instance:

Refrain 1:
To have a ghost of a chance,
He must be able to dance.
The sort of boy wanted
Must have a smile
Boy wanted,
Lovable style.
He must be tender and true,
And if he knows what to do,
I think I`ll learn to love him very soon;
I`ll want him morning, night and afternoon.
So if you know of one who`s wanting employment,
Just tell him that
I`m wanting a boy!

Refrain 2:
To be the boy of my choice,
He`s got to own a Rolls Royce.
He must be quite reckless
Buying me things:
Pearl necklace,
Diamond rings.
He must be ready to pay
A dozen bills ev`ry day.
I`ll simply smothing him with tender care
If I could find a multimillionaire.
So if you could seen one dining at the Savoy-oh!
Just tell him
I`m wanting a boy!

Refrain 3:
I won`t have anyone small,
He must be handsome and tall.
I said a boy wanted,
Beautifully dressed;
Boy wanted,
Trousers well pressed.
He must have wonderful eyes;
He must wear wonderful ties.
I want a boy who`ll always look as though
He`s only just come out of Savile Row.

Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Kiri Te Kanawa,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

I'd rather have Jesus than silver and gold

For unto us a child is born
A son is given
I'd rather have Jesus
What profits a man to gain the whole world and lose His soul
I'd rather have Jesus
For there's no other name given under heaven
Whereby we must be saved
I'd rather have Jesus
He's the only one that can save you
I'd rather have Jesus than silver and gold",Silver & Gold,1993
Kirk Franklin,"For some that don't understand our purpose
And may not understand our praise
We as the family in Jesus name
Would like to tell you the reason why we sing
Family

Someone asked a question
Why do we sing
When we lift our hands to Jesus
What do we really mean
Someone made we wonder
When we sing our song
At times we may be cryin'
And nothings even wrong

I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
His eyes are the sparrow
That's the reason why I sing
Glory Hallelujah
Your the reason why I sing

For some that don't understand our purpose
And may not understand our praise
We as the family in Jesus name
Would like to tell you the reason why we sing
Family

I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
His eyes are the sparrow
That's the reason why I sing
Glory Hallelujah
Your the reason why I sing

Glory Hallelujah
Your the reason why I sing
Glory Hallelujah
Your the reason why I sing
Glory Hallelujah
I give the praises to you
Glory Hallelujah
Your the reason why I sing

And when the song is over
We've all said Amen
And your heart just keep on singing
And the song will never end
And if somebody ask you was it just a show
Lift your and a be a witness
And tell the whole the whole world no
And when we cross that river
To study war no more
We will sing our song to Jesus
The one whom we adore

I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
His eyes are the sparrow
That's the reason why I sing
Glory Hallelujah
Your the reason why I sing

Glory Hallelujah
Your the reason why I sing
Glory Hallelujah
Your the reason why I sing
Glory Hallelujah
I give the praises to you
Glory Hallelujah
Your the reason why I sing

Your the reason why I sing
Your the reason why I sing
Your the reason why I sing
Your the reason why I sing
Your the reason why I sing

Oh I love you
I love your name Jesus
Glory Hallelujah
For the rest of my life Jesus
You'll be the reason why I sing",Why We Sing,1993
