Danny Blume,"I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen
And all its sad good-byes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

Shoulda known better than to cheat a friend
And waste this chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Tonight the music seems so loud
I am wishing that we could lose this crowd
But maybe it's better this way
We hurt each other with the things we wanna say

We could have been so good together
We could have danced this dance forever
But no one's gonna dance with me
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're, know you're not a fool

I shoulda known better than to cheat a friend
And waste this chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you",Mi Yamalay,2005

I can't wash off what the good Lord made ya
No matter how far that highway goes
An old dirt road'll get you home (c'mon!)
If you see it in their eye when they try to lie
If you the bullet-hole-in-a-stop-sign kind
Then I'm right there wit'cha, put your drinks up high
For my country folk (hey) my country folk (hey)

I'm out here on a thousand acre plot of land
And I can't hear 'em hatin' on me, I'm a modest man
Talkin' with Jimmy Mathis and he got a plan
And when he talk I listen to him, that's a lot of man (pops!)
He said we need to take it back to the root of it
I put on for the country, that's the truth of it
I'm talkin' last millenium we was reppin' it
Before anybody had accepted it (anybody!)
We introduced 'em to the cooler on the tailgate
Full of cold Nattie Light playin' ""Satellite""
A lil' Dave while we misbehave, okay (okay)
Once we figured the game out, we go play (go!)
The generation of people that love 2Pac
And hate, we bangin' it in the boondocks
Now put your drink in the air if you ain't scared
Dem folks been doin' that thang, yeah

See me and Bubba, we've been doin' this a long while
It sure seems a lot longer than a country mile

I never thought we could ever be here again (we back!)
Time heals, one fell, one came up
Back together son, we gon' tear this thing up
A lot of talk cousin, I ain't gotta name 'em
They wanna be us, hell I can't blame 'em (nah)
So looky here, cold beer on the tailgate
Been doin' this for some years, y'all so late (so late!)

E'rything real funny 'til the money come (and then what?)
Now they want some (what) when they ain't wanted none (oh)
And that's just how the thing go when you get 'er done (how?)

We was drinkin' Jim Beam by the handle (handle)
Me and Steven heard they're loadin' up ammo (ammo)
Bumpin' Goodie Mob, real tree camo (camo)
This white boy really think he Rambo! (Go!)

Danny Boy,"Yeah
Clear enough for ya? Yea right
Why you niggas look mad?
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free!
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
Ho bustas!

Picture me rolling in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be telling
Know there's dope being sold, but I ain't the one selling!
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from going under
The federales wanna see me dead
Niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by me bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shooting at your crib
Mama, I'm still thugging, the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheming on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossing a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beating and my hands are swollen
Thinking of the G's I'll be holdin', picture me rollin'

Can you see me now? (Oh picture me rollin')
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it?
Picture me rollin' (picture me rollin')
Yeah nigga!
Ay, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?

I got keys coming from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss 'cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug, branded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swanging
Make me wanna start back banging
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packing 40 Glocks, contain em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy coming from my enemies
While I'm sipping on Remy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 Big body, sitting on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facing is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm living a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
It's hard to imagine picture me rollin'!

Picture, picture me rollin'
Rollin', picture me rollin'
Wheelin', picture me rollin'
Picture me yea yeah

I gots to get the fuck up in it
Formulate a caper
'Cause a nigga straight suffering from lack of having paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some ballin' ass niggas, and they slippin' in my spot
And, uh, diggin' the plots (so what?)
Checking in the park, 'Pac

We caught em sleeping, he didn't peep you niggas creeping?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
Cpo, we got the bomb spot, nigga time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you could get the females
This crooked shit that we inflicting getting street sales!

Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9

Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swollen

And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride (every time we ride)
Hitting motherfuckers up when we pass by (when we pass by)
Until I die, live the life of a boss player
Cause even when I'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later
The futures in my eyes, cause all I want is cash and things
A five-double-oh, Benz flaunting flashy rings,
Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been know to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfucking razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's getting jealous, and motherfuckers died
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me

So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changing everyday, times moving fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman, and my pistol, and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, living life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve
I'm taking off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a tec
Devoted to serving this, Moet and pay-checks
Like Akai satellite nigga I'm forever balling
It ain't right parasites triggers and fleas crawling
Sucker duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handling my business nigga keep on coasting
Where you going I been there came back as lonely homie
Steady flowing against the grain niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny niggas don't even know how to act, shit!
What can I do, what can I say, is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, twenty-fo' parlay

On my mobile calling big shots on the scene major

Danny Boy,"Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit cha, I ain't mad at cha
Got nuttin but love for ya, do your thing boy

Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all, kna' mean?
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there, kickin' up dust
Givin' a motherfucker,
Yeah, niggas, mad at cha
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
Member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn
On the block, witcha glock, trippin off sherm
Collect calls to the till, sayin' how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the Mosque, don't wanna chase tail
I seems I lost my little homie he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulation on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb!
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed, and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme, and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker bad
Go toe to toe when it's time for roll you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go head
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
(Hmm) (I ain't mad at cha)

I ain't, mad, at cha (I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin', that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' n grindin' wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back, to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause Mama I ain't happy here
I'm through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin, ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause youse a down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha

I ain't, mad, at cha (I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha (A true down ass bitch, afund I ain't mad at cha)

Well guess who's movin up, this nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carots to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big, man on the block
He's Mister local celebrity, addicted to move a key
Most hated by enemy, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb hopin' we make it, to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time,
You'll find a rhyme'll blaze you'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as a adolescents, I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions, and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?

You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha

Danny Boy,"Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit cha, I ain't mad at cha
Got nuttin but love for ya, do your thing boy

Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all, kna' mean?
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there, kickin' up dust
Givin' a motherfucker,
Yeah, niggas, mad at cha
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
Member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn
On the block, witcha glock, trippin off sherm
Collect calls to the till, sayin' how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the Mosque, don't wanna chase tail
I seems I lost my little homie he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulation on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb!
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed, and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme, and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker bad
Go toe to toe when it's time for roll you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go head
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
(Hmm) (I ain't mad at cha)

I ain't, mad, at cha (I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin', that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' n grindin' wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back, to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause Mama I ain't happy here
I'm through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin, ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause youse a down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha

I ain't, mad, at cha (I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha (A true down ass bitch, afund I ain't mad at cha)

Well guess who's movin up, this nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carots to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big, man on the block
He's Mister local celebrity, addicted to move a key
Most hated by enemy, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb hopin' we make it, to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time,
You'll find a rhyme'll blaze you'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as a adolescents, I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions, and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha

I ain't, mad at cha (and I ain't mad at cha)

Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free!
Y'all niggaz look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail, hahah!
Hoe bustaz

Picture me rollin in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggaz, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be tellin
Know there's dope bein sold, but +I+ ain't the one sellin!
Don't want to be another number
I got a fuckin gang of weed to keep from goin under
The federales want to see me dead - niggaz put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottwillers by me bed, I feed em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live? Will God forgive me 
for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
when niggaz shootin at your crib
Mama, I'm still thuggin, the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheamin on ways 
to put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin
Flossin a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beatin and my hands is swollen
thinkin of the G's I'll be holdin, picture me rollin

Can you see me now? Heheheh
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a CLEAR picture

Ay but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?

I got ki's, comin from overseas
Cost a nigga two hundred G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss cause I'm more like a boss playa
Thug, branded to be a women layer
So mny playa haters, imitaters steady swangin
Make me want to start back bangin
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packin forty glocks, contain em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy comin from my enemies
While I'm sippin on Re-mi
in front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
Ninety-six big body, sittin on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facin is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm livin a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin
It's hard to imagine -- picture me rollin!

Picture, picture me, picture me rollin
Rollin, picture me rollin
Wheelin, picture me rollin in
Picture me yea yeah

Mmm, I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
Cause a nigga straight sufferin from lack of havin paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some baldin-ass niggaz and they slippin in my spot
And, uh, diggin the plots (so what?)
Checkin in the park, 'Pac

We caught em sleepin, he didn't peep you niggaz creepin?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
CPO, we got the bomb spot, nigga time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you could get the females
This crooked shit that we inflictin gettin street sales

Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my nine
I'm as cool as a motherfucker, I'ma get mine
Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swollen
Boss Hog and this 'Pac nigga... picture us rollin

Rollin

You can take your head, and hold it up
And tell the man, you've had enough
It's time he realize, that things are through
It's time that he get over you

You should wipe your tears away, it's over now

Some women don't recognize, they don't exist
They feel that they can't survive, without their man, yeah, yeah
It's time we all realize
It's not worth it, if you treat it so bad
Lift up your head, show somebody
Get back the respect in your life

You don't need to be touched on
Makin love over rough zone
Playa hater get crushed on

Collectin dust on my spot from the cops heat
Hit the block gon shop for some nice meat

'cause a brother want to bail to the mall
To ball wit all the blunts
Treat me right you deserve some dough
But never earn my trust

Smokin' reefa
Hm yeah

I woke up early Saturday morning sick off Rhemy and brews
Wit a hang over from blues
Hurl on my clothes and shoes stomach on wooz
From this killer weed that's so fired it made your nose bleed
I had me so high, my brain was fried movin' at slow speed
This thick bitch chose me and was stickin' like liquor
She look to tight that bodies right my heart and mind was like ""Dick her""
But wit my body aching from hurl sensation that's got me shaken
I swiftly took the number and passed on ass that was for the taken
I remember wakin up at the flat fucked up in the back
Checkin on my weed and scratch I damn near fell out the lat
I hit the sack to sleep it off woke up woozy and still smoking
Twista's wishes thinking about last night and the bitch that was scopin'
Fuck it lets get 'em on I grabbed the phone ""Girl call your friends""
Then I hit Twista and Maze and them bout the bitch in the Benz
Nigga push only cause I see them already been in the block
You know the lit niggas you'll find us in my favorite spot
And that's on

On the front porch getting deeper
Ghetto love got 'em feelin', um hm yeah yeah

In the summer I hit the front porch wit a morning be	
Sippin' on the duce duce OZ
And I be killin' me how many thick fees I see
Getting bubbly waitin' for Stokes and T, I spit a little game at three
Tryin' to talk up on the shoppin' spree
Or a be	 of that stinky green free
Straight getting, to puff puff pass 
and drive up my gas hittin' all the hot blocks
Bumpin' ""Legit Ballers"" to ""Rock y'all Spot""
Everybody know the shit 'bout to drop
See from Northbound to Ten Row in it go tryin' to get they props
Pollutin' the air wit squares, blunts, and tops
Settin' up shops for lots comin' back nots
Each and everyday of the week 
the Mobsta Elites be on somebody porch dumpin' heat
Bustin' flows in the cipher getting deep 
While we cheat something sweet to Legendary beats
'Till we reached our peak
Scummy aloud attractin' crowds to the street
Then it's time to retreat grab something to eat
And head to the late front to get up wit some freaks
Wit a treat under the seat
For the cats who get the sudden urge and want to try to jack
Cause when your pockets is fat
It seems like all the haters and hood-rats want to attack
And when the park close we hit the liquor store 
for a box of Sitches and a fifth of Yak
South on the corner and get a few sacks 
Or betta yet the whole pack so we can get back
On the

One morning I
Woke up next to a chocolate fee and a red bone 
My dick was hard I started stroking and poking
After toppin' I tell them to role the blunt
Cause on the front I hear them niggas steady smoking and jokin'
I heard it's gonna be hot outside gotta get up and lay my clothes out
It's gonna be too many hoes out 
Before my ladies rolled out I got 'em to clean up the whole house
Then I threw my fit on look in the mirror get on gone
""Nigga you looking dope because you got a knot""
Ain't no cruising up out the hop 
I'm hangin' by the spot cause I had to put the Lexus off up in the shop
But it's all to good it's a hood thang 
Never too bogus notice the love on the block that nigga coolin'
Aiming the radio out the window steady grooving
Tip by the corner store wit the indo steady movin'
Niggas who flippin' new 98's is steady cruising 
Bumpin' up the block flossin' for the chicks cause they rich
But I ain't leavin' off the front with the blunt 
Set a switch just to pull in all the thickest bitches
At the crib I can't get caught wit heat
If it's some static I shall chalk and sweep
I go and get the B's up off but chief
""Come get me if the phone for me I'm at the party across the street""
I'm enjoying the breeze high degrees and no ease
Pockets be full of G's smoking B's hiding the fees
Making no enemies the po P's yellin' out ""Freeze""
Serving niggas wit ease staking cheese so nigga please
Tell me 'bout some ghetto love

Got you curious for Thug Passion, now picture that
Tongue-kissing, hand full of hair, look in my eyes
Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you moving in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweating up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespecting when I tongue-kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect?
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top
I pull over, getting busy in the parking lot
And don't you love it how I lick your hips and glide?
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside
Got you lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust
I got the bedroom shaking, back-breaking, when we're tossing it up

Listen baby, I like the way it's going down
When nobody's around, slip-slide ride

Danny Brown,"L. Ron Hubbard with no bling
Vitamin Water and codeine
You think you know things
But you know no things
I'm just waiting for the bell to go ‘ding'
Maybe we can sell the whole thing
Keep your hand in your pocket
They can smell the gold ring
If somebody felled an old tree
Jokingly and only three people got the joke
“Is the tree pine, maple, or oak, or other?”
I'm the other brother from another mother
The other light meat
You like me?
I might be your father

Another episode
You niggas still writing pilots
I'm the big dog
Yousa fire hydrant
The big mack, spend a thousand on the islands
I'm toking violent
You're smoking Miley Cyrus
I tell my hoes what they want
To hear like I'm a psychic
Don't like young hoes
Those bitches can't cook
I eat an old ho like the big bad wolf
I cop a pound and everyday (?) is on
That means I got the grams like an old folks' home
Bitches licking on the dick like its Mister Softee
Blowing all on it like it's hot coffee
And she deep throat
And she lick my nuts
That's a combination nut lick and dick suck
Das Racist, like the black quarterback
Let me get a load of that for my cataracts

Otherworld Newspeak
Y'all know how I spit
Half-internet, half-high school cafeteria shit
I'm hype how the internet get
Yo, 2x4's with like splinters and shit
White demons with green pockets
Line up at our shows to peep game
How we rock it?
No qualms with cockblocking white dudes from Boston
I don't know why people think we give a fuck so often
We Waco, we Maaco
But you are just a toucher
Homie, take your heart out your chest, no (?)
Talk it how I walk it
Himanshu got ‘nuff guff
Other words: you could get roughed up, tough stuff
Your band about as lame as Staind or Train
""Soul Sister"" hold blisters on my brain
Probably think this song is about you, you vain
But me, I'm burning one to Carl Thomas's ""Summer Rain""
Chilling, relaxing, having a good time

The name don't ring bells: it break doors down
The neighbors hear yells from eight floors down
They say ""This here's Hell, it's all yours now""
All around nice guys get stuffed for sport, clown
Life check: 1, 2, what is this?
""Your money or your life?""
And I'm like, ""What's the difference?""
And if the price is right, I could buy all you dipshits
Put him near a mike and the rest not your business
Chumps
Save yourself the lumps
Why shoot the five a hundred times
When you could shoot the nine once?
And come and find a little guy can pack a supersize punch
Bar sixteen, a pregnant verse come every nine months
Until next time
Thanks for tuning in
The hooligans whose tunes is too loony for the loony bin
This is how we doin', doin'
This is how we do it again

Danny Brown,"Sent ya bitch a dick pic and now she need glasses
Turn your bitch Slick Rick right now if I flashed it
Ate a couple pills took the bud out the plastic
Flicking bogey ashes bitch I stay blasted
Microphone Cassius, Magic with the sick shit
'posed to been dead but bitch I’m still up in this bitch
Verbal herbal poison, words I contortion
Fucked a pregnant bitch, she saved money on her abortion
I feel like Billy Corgan in a church playing organ
Covering Too Short, smoking a Newport
Hurt hope the drugs will help the pain to go away
But all these thoughts up in my head made the sane go astray
Step inside a mind that revolves around the rhyme
And every time he close his eyes, visions of white lines
Dying in the arms of a blond blue eyed 20 something
Don’t know her name but the paramedics chest pumping
30 something black male, OD'ed off of pills
That he wasn’t prescribed but they took his life
Left behind a daughter that doesn’t really even know him
Cause her momma thought he wouldn’t make a living off of poems
But it was a long journey on a rocky road
Had a hoody on and a jacket in the snow
Walking in the cold on the way to the studio
Nigga, that was just a couple years ago
Dropped a couple mixtapes on the net
And niggas tried to front like it wasn’t all that
But guess what bitch I’m coming back
Guess what bitch I’m coming back
Signed to Fool's Gold and everything’s all gnarly
Now these bitches want my number to get up in party
Came a long way from extension cords in the window
Borrowing neighbor's power just to plug up the Nintendo
Where the ovens never closed and stoves never off
Every winter so cold niggas sleeping wearing scarves
But I always tell myself that it's gonna get better
You know who you is, you the greatest rapper ever
So now the pressures on him to prove that voice right
Some people never know they goals, knew mine my whole life
So now his turn's up fixing up to bat
Pitching singles to the label when I use to pitch crack
I never learned to rap, always knew how
Ever since a nigga 8, knew what I would do now
When I turned 28 they like what you gonna do now
And now a nigga 30 So I don’t think ya'll heard me
That the last ten years I been so fucking stressed
Tears in my eyes let me get this off my chest
The thought of no success got a nigga chasing death
Doing all these drugs in hopes of OD’ing next, Triple X",30,2011
Danny Brown,"Eating on an Adderall, wash it down with alcohol
Writing holy mackarel, actual all factual
Out for the capital, matador ya capsules
Hassle the bitch in a castle with the ill grapples
Tackled her asshole, my dick was like a lasso
Fucked her in her mouth she washed it down with Tabasco

You softer than Flanders' son
Don't make me put hands on son
Jump niggas like ""Fuck one on one.""
Used to be locked up watching One on One
Young Kyla Pratt was looking thick, nigga wanted some
But soon as I got out white bitches by the tons

I fuck bad bitches to Stacy Lattisaw
While you niggas got blue balls like a Avatar
Eating caviar in El Salvador
She running from my dick like it's a bull and she the matador
She a pregnant labrador
Said my metaphors are the highest caliber

And they try to tell me I get too high
That's a lie if so bitch I woulda been died
But the flow OD, don't get cochesed, capiche?
Fuck with me, fuck around and be deceased
Rest in peace wack niggas with your oversized clothes
Complain about my jeans cause I'm taking all they hoes
Hold up, wait a minute
Your pussy ain't shit 'til you had some Danny in it
I'm gone off a Zanny nodding off watching menace
Rolling on some purple that my nigga call Grimmace
Bitch I ain't finish
These bars was test tubed in the lab with foreign chemist
Rolling testers on it but statistics got slumped
I'm smoking blunt after blunt

And I smoke

'Til my brain feels ten pounds heavier
You fell off like Tom Selleck in a Celica
Bitch give me brain for the hell of it
But to her it's heaven if she even gets a smell of it
That's why these bitches fuck with me
Cause I eat that pussy like a female MC
You get it? How about me and your girlfriend, you with it?
Money over everything the only thing that matter
And since I been getting it my been blunts getting fatter
Take a couple puffs off it now a nigga woozy
The white hoes I fuck with consider them whooties

You'd swear it was 1985 and Teen Wolf just dropped
And my name was Michael J. Fox
But no bitch my name is Danny Brown I got some weed up in my sock
So bitch get high with ya nigga
The sack I got is looking some green caterpillars
But it smell like a skunk that's oh so defensive
These bitches suck my dick like it was moral incentive
Off the chain like broke nunchucks
Where little niggas try to shoot you over new chucks
A little dark like wet nubuck
Describes my state of mind is inside the tomb of King Tut
Murder all the time all we see
Detroit 187 on you niggas TV
I can first degree this beat, kill a nigga, no charges
Fuck a female MC and a Pop Artist
Ohh baby I like it raw

And My dick so big left stretch marks on her jaw
I'm so institutionalized
I wake up 6 AM because I think its chow time
Borderline porcupine
A step from drinking turpentine
Just to wash down a plate of wack rappers rhymes
I got a mind in the cosmos
And if these niggas cold then I guess I'm osmosis
That be blowing on some potent
That these white boys be growing
While you niggas smoking something smelling like tanning lotion
My concoctions could make world ending potions
These other rap niggas got lines I got encroachments
I got endorsements so muthafucka a cosign
Punch punchlines I'll punch rappers til your broke spine
Remember back in 09
I told em it was showtime
Now they pull they cam phones out when I go for mine
Light camera action
Hybrid be snapping
Cause the days of no tissue had to whip with wet napkins
Smear up the classifieds know it sound trife
But to be honest a metaphor for my life

Buzzin' off the barbiturates and amphetamines
Chase it with a 40 oz of Redi Clean
I swear I never ever smoke the better weed
Yo bitch said I'm the swaggiest nigga she ever seen
Run up in yo crib, Two K's, One Mag
Yo girl get snatched like Cool J in I'm Bad
Cost to live, you ain't made enough
Guarantee bullet holes with a laser touch
European garments drape my body if I ain't hipstered up
If she smile with eye contact then the bitch will fuck
Homie gone make me send them killers after him
Them niggas swing swords like World Fence Champions
You was poppin' pills and drinking liquor
Now you thinkin' you a gangsta killer
I leave you stankin' nigga
Laid down, face down like you taking a plankin picture
But I can keep the shots in the weapon

And employed by none other than them fools with the gold
And them bankrolls explode
And your bitch is my target when I shoot my load
Bulls-eye, my eyes tie-dyed
Fried off the same shit that rockstars died from
Smoke something with your main bitch
Like Wyclef used to sell the cannabis
Manuscript sick shit, prescription addiction
Sniffing adderall off the counter in my kitchen
Tripping off the shit that had Brian Wilson flipping
Experiment so much it's a miracle I'm living

Basquiat freestyle
Feeling like Jimi Hendrix and Anna-Nicole mouth

Terry cloth bathrobes, blunts and ashtrays
White wine in flute glass, early morning Saturdays
Food plates and grape Ape, crepes and OJ

Bitches sniffing coke off each other titties with rolled 50s
Life I live like Charlie Sheen and Rick James
Goin hard until it ain't a dollar to my name

Adderall popping got me jumping to ceiling
Perceived as a villian no sentiment in my sentence
For instance in instants they'll be calling forensics
If incidents occur remember these ain't just words
Go from talking shit to organs preserved
You soft serve rappers just hide behind your reverb
And even without effects you'll end up dessert
I research and homework, make you dig ya own dirt
On beats buried alive, ratting wiseguys
I'm with a latin bitch, fat ass, well porportioned thighs
And love to see it cumming so I squirt it in her eyes
I'm hopping out that new shit like narcs on Tuesday
The grill on it shiny like LL Cool J's
What's on my waist could make a nigga meet ya doomsday
To describe ya mixtape that shit was like a toothache

Explains all the soul that you hear in my sound
A ten minute ride to Linwood, I begun
My mama first son, look what I become
A weedhead with words that poking what I'm smoking
This ain't no Reggie cause the flame rise from Oakland
I used to play with pistols and crackhouses
Skiping school just to fuck bitches on dirty couches, abandoned houses
Find one with the lights on it
Landlord came pulled the hook and locks on it
Money I'm plotting on it I put the block on it
I'm gonna get it, fold deep, no shocks on it

A lot of niggas gone over something unimportant
That it ain't worth mentioning cause it's unfortunate
Like stick a fork in it, where's the enforcement?
Walking off the grass just to sit on niggas porches
Passing round 40's, brown paper bags
Rolling up a swisher while this rat freak a black
It ain't about nothing, but let me hold something
Ate a lunchable for dinner, nigga I'm ain't fronting
Caught the bus to East land, just to walk around it
Ain't buy nothing nigga, just walked around it
Looked at some hoes, I ain't even holler

You know that one house where Kenneth use to live
Now its just another shortcut to the store
The TV in the window drew the line of what was rich and poor
Mommy gave me food stamps told me buy wonder bread
On the way these niggas jumped me, left me wit knots on my head
Went to school yesterday and to had leave early
Cause niggas said they was gon' jump me at 3:30
All because I lived in the hood who they had beef with
And I ain't tell em, dog, I kept that shit a secret
But I can't really trip, niggas looked out for me
Them same niggas played me ain’t around to tell the story
I'm just young nigga on the D.O.T
With my headphones on and sack full of weed

Smoking on some dirt weed smelling like some fire wood
Sitting on porches of abandoned houses
Or sitting in the field on bed bug ridden couches
It's like they all forgot man nobody care about us
That why we all ways end up in prison instead of college
Living in the system working kitchen for chump change
Lost in the streets niggas playing that gun game
Where nobody wins just a bunch of mommas losing
Dead body in the field, nobody heard the shooting
We living in the streets where the options is limited
Cause its burnt building instead of jobs and businesses

So guess who's the little bitch? That's you
You must suck a lot of dick, that's true
I misuse with issues and pistols
Mind racing like Bristol heart of igloos
My nigga, you ain't been what I been through
And if so, you'd take a pencil through your temple
Cause I done served fiends on they menstrual
Ain't even have pads, stuffed they panties with tissue
Hit the ave cause they mouth ain't bleeding
And your style's like fried chicken without the seasoning
Nigga, that's bland fuck you up and ya mans
I smack you like a bitch, nigga, that's open-hand
Fuck you and your tough talk
When I monopolize I throw your ass off the boardwark
Fag, you ain't play sports but always at the ball park?
Type of nigga rocking Crocs at the fucking Walmart?
Drunk like Stallworth, riding in the fiend car
Get flicked, guess what? I'm running from this fiend car
I know a nigga dirty and got the hammer
But this kush got me high like Pac bandanna

I'm a smart nigga that do dumb shit
In your baby momma crib, not flushing after I piss
I'm Ferris Bueller with Frank Muellers, you blank shooters
On stank hooters, I'm in Aruba sipping wine cooler
Mind ruler, sort of like hypnotism
That's why these white bitches wanna get with him
I smack it, flip it, like Mike Bivins
But to me your flow's like Ronny DeVoe's
My hoes got toes in expensive high heels
Your hoes' toes is fucked--beauty supply sandals?
Handle any situation
I smoke blunts to the face to stay motivated
Irritated when I'm not sedated
Fuck her face like I was obligated
And still fucking with them freak hoes
Stank pussy smelling like Cool Ranch Doritos",Monopoly,2011
Danny Brown,"Business cards from her attorney
Got probation cause the parents paid the money
Six months rehab, but she's back at it
Reflection stare at it, but she can't look at it!
She wiped out the debit card, owing on the credit
For student loans, they call her phone, but she don't sweat it!
Cocaine on counter tops, separate in lines
Every time she do it, she says this her last time
Chasing that high from the very first time
Back in her dorm room in 2009
Never thought this relationship would come this far
Rolled singles in her nose, I'm blade sniffing hard!
In night club stalls her and her friends sniff it all
Never sleep in random dude's apartments, missed calls
Unreplied texts from her boyfriend
Feeling like any second the world can end
And when it freeze her, it make her pussy wet
Face rushing, going numb, nipple hard on them breasts
Sniffing 'til it drip, back of the class, blood running down her lips!",Nosebleeds,2011
Danny Brown,"Meet the future face to face
And make sure feel like you there in outer space
We need to see

It's the Adderall Admiral, writing holy macarel
Your bitch say my dick long like the strap on a satchel
I took me a capsule with no hassle
Now it's like I dip feathers of ink in a castle
A prodigy like bullets that hit your left clavicle
Melt sweat suits and paint the avenue
You have no clue like toy stores without board games
But when I paint pictures, I'm dipping brushes in war paint

I'm a mothafuckin' mothafucka
Fucking on your mother with two rubbers, I do fuck her
No cover just her booty on a pillow
Your bitch said my dick tastes like tropical fruit Skittles
I'm bumping Bill Withers, Swishers on Schwarzenegger
Matter fact, nah nigga, they on Boa Constrictors, they'll choke a nigga
These niggas ain't rappers, they mothafuckin' characters
Caught your baby momma horny then I stuck a carrot in her
Then you made a salad with her, ate isht for dinner
I don't want that skinny bitch look like that ho from Thinner
Swore she played soccer, she was real good with headers
Had me yelling ""Goal!"" while I was sitting on the dresser
Give the bitch a hat trick, smoking on the cat piss
I keep the bitch wet, around you she's a cactus

I got them Penis Psalms for your Vagina Monologues
Love a feminist bitch, oh, it get my dick hard
So no apologies for all the misogyny
I just want your company to come and watch some porn with me
My oral orchestration causes manipulation
The way these hoes be chasing though I had the tongue of Satan
But I just gave 'em dick to get more for conversation
Why you niggas tricking, giving your obligation
You safe havens, I'm Wes Craven with X cravings
Fuck a bitch mouth until her fucking face cave in
Hidden cams in her house, I caught her masturbating
Extorted her for the cash, now your ass paying
You Captin Save-Them-Ass, nigga
I don't give a bitch shit but hard dick and liquor
So so nice to meet you, I hope that you're safe",Outer Space,2011
Danny Brown,"The Shakespeare of 16's, dipping my ink pen
Made a sculpture of me but my dick was too thin
Painting pictures of me but they never get my chin
One writing scriptures bringing tears to the princess
Every time I indent, you can see the intent
Leave your mind bent, hanging on the every sentence
Have no apprentice, style uninherited
Laughing at you peasants cause my penmanship is excellence
Whenever in the presence, eyes get wide
I'm the town hero cause my words give them pride
And what they feel inside, I say the perfect words for 'em
Some say I'm a prophet with the visions I get cursed for
Leave them all astonished, ride with the birds
Make a grown man cry with shrimp on the words

Tears to Mona Lisa, Medusa to liquid
Flow can make Gandhi grab the burner, wanna shoot shit
Rhymes that make the Pope wanna get his dick sucked
Had Virgin Mary doing lines in the pick-up
Make Sarah Palin deep-throat 'til she hiccup
Had T.D. Jakes round this bitch doing stick-ups
Rhymes so real, thought I wrote it in Pac blood
Told me in my dreams that these niggas is not thugs

What's in the portfolio? Sicker than polio
Shit so personal, my mom can't listen to
Oh so original, nigga's extra-crispy
Bars so Bukowski, Soda Popinski
Little Macs could never be number one, your time's done
Bomb filling smelling like napalm, your day's gone
Langston Hughes with a blew fuse and a screw loose
Maya Angelou abused child with her notebook
Spitting like Kipling with a tooth missing
Tongue bring torture to men, women and children
Memoir's sacred, hid in the basement
Await my next piece at a formal engagement
Crowds walk for miles just to hear that sound
Start to get more power than the ones that wear crowns

Tears to Mona Lisa, Medusa to liquid
Flow can make Gandhi grab the burner, wanna shoot shit
Rhymes that make the Pope wanna get his dick sucked
Had Virgin Mary doing lines in the pick-up
Make Sarah Palin deep-throat 'til she hiccup

Danny Brown,"Always wanna go
Always tell her yes, never tell her no
Know you think you know everything but don't
Wanna do the right thing but probably won't
So you chase the nightlife, blinded by the lights
Bottom of a empty glass, where you find life
Always left behind, because she think she right
Thinking that she grown she don't need your advice
And always in situation that she needs your help
But wouldn't help another only care her about herself
In your VIP asking where the drink at
Calling her a groupie you'd think she'd really think that
She just wanna hear that that ass look right
What you doing after this fuck tomorrow night
Wanna snort some blow, pop a lotta pills
Fucking when the sun come up she don't feel

She wanna party all the time, party all the time

Skip semester, class is a past
Say she going back but she ain't going back
Cause time ain't waiting for a future on hold
At glass tables on her knees sniffing coke
Tell her get a hold, grip on life
Rather fill her cup up liquor with no ice
Twice had an abortion, young, dumb misfortune
Rate that going she might be whoring
Signs she ignoring but doesn't recognize
Blind to what's occuring what's going on in your mind
Seven days a week, same shit every morning
Calling her a cab from different niggas apartment
Wanting her to change but she won't, dog
Just another number in her fucking call log
Lost in the fog, head in the smoke
Laughing at the world cause her life is a joke

She wanna party all the time, party all the time",Party All the Time,2011
Danny Brown,"This is anti-clean rap, nigga where the green at?
Risks I take you'd swear I had the balls the size of bean bags
Not what you're used to, bitch I rep the Bruiser
And the label Fool's Gold, jeans with Medusa
Bitches wanna scoop us, get pussy like loofahs
Y'all niggas losers cop clothes from the boosters
Hoes wanna choose up, of course they gon' choose us
So though you need a stylist also you need a tutor
These stupid-ass niggas wouldn't know what to do
So they copy wack niggas, that's what they made you
The game's so trendy, that's why these labels fails
Cause they don't care about music, just first week sales

So they say you need a hit, a chart toppin' single
That's why it's called commercial, because you need a jingle
A smash crowd banger, play it all night long
You never get on, without a radio song
So this my radio song, this my radio song

She wanna ride the wave, watch me do my swag surf
Party like a rockstar, never bought a makeup purse
Songs with no feelings, but she feel my thang on her
Stripper with a leaky ceiling, I'mma make it rain on her
Taught me how to Dougie, I'd rather see you jerk
Until it skeet skeet, on the walls and her shirt
She'd rather hear a love song about what she getting
But not from Danny Brown, cause bitch I ain't tricking
Do the pretty girl rock, and even though you ugly
Getting dirty money, but bitch I ain't Puffy
Ice cream paint job, semi with the hemi
Heavy duty Chevy, not a Beamer, Benz or Bentley
There's no originality, carbon copy singles
He made Black and Yellow, I'mma make it black and emo
That's why these wack rappers, they never last long
Don't care about music, just radio songs

A family live there got put out last month
My uncle sniffing blow while I'm rolling up a blunt
His homey in the basment smoking crack wit muh aunt
And tonights that night we bout to get right
Piled up in a van wit a couple flashlights
This metal crowbars gonna get us through the door
We come to take everything fuck the landlord
So now we at the place skullys on bareface
Bout to leave this bitch bare and strip the whole place
My unc took outside he ripping down the gutters
So we inside tearing up this motherfucker
Bust open the walls just to get the wiring
Took the hot water tank and left over appliances
Aluminum siding and had to come back
Cause the furnace so big it wouldn't fit in the back

Now its copper by the pound
Wire by the inch

Early morning next day at the junkyard
Got four loads bout to get broke off
But these niggas slick I swear I'm going off
Put the work on the scale and I swear that bitch was off
Cause I know we had way more than that
Fuck it, split it up ay I get more than that
These niggas always slick on that bullshit
Cheat you out a couple bucks on some dope fiend shit
Now we back in the hood plot the next lick
Got a school closed down and I think we should hit it
Just waiting on my unc to get back from the clinic
And we gone go over there and see whats up wit it
Now we up in it taking old computers
Until we fucking heard ""Don't move or I shoot ya.""
Fucked up hook caught us tryna cash in
Now we gotta B&E case of trespassing

Colder than them grits they fed slaves
Me to rap is like water to raves
AK's with bayonets on deck, rep my set
Sorta like Squidward and his clarinet
I'm in ya bitch mouth but she just fantasizing
Staring at my skinnys said it's so tantalizing
Dog I'm strategizing, plotting on throne
The masta of the ace sitting on chrome
Dark nights tryna sleep stomach on fire
Delusional from hunger so I couldn't get tired
Imagining the equalizer goin from green to red
Words that rhyme together just appear all in my head
Sorta like Neo with the Matrix code
I try to escape it hoping drugs a numb a soul
Say I'm getting old and times running out
Repeating instrumentals tryna figure patterns out
I never leave the house ain't slept in three days
Popping pills, writing, drinking and smoking haze
Weaving kicks and snares, tryna dodge these hooks
Keepin' it original something that's overlooked
The way a nigga going might go out like Sam Cooke
Or locked up calling home for money on my books
Cause if this shit don't work, nigga I failed at life
Turning to these drugs, now these drugs turned my life
And it's the downward spiral, got me suicidal
But too scared to do it so these pills will be the rifle
Surpassing all my idols, took the wrong turn
But can't go back now so now let that blunt burn
Cause now its my turn if I fuck it all up
Took a while to get here now I depend on these drugs
I took a while to get here now I depend on these drugs

Danny Brown,"Remember when my first meal was school lunch
Now I spit a 16 straight with no punch
Remember all for dinner all we ate was Captain Crunch
Now we blow big blunts on the way to brunch
Went from good fella to commissary slips
Now I got back up man every time I slipped
Never ever quit, I just kept on pursuing
Teacher always ask me, what was I doing
Scribbled in my notebook and never did homework
Low attention span, guess these Adderall worked
Rocked Tommy Hil shirts, ones with the boat
Rockport kicks way before we even smoked
Used to have baby lungs, choking when I hit it
Nowadays lace a whole seven in a sitting
Remember back then we thought we growed up
Rushing at a kid just to be grown up

Rushing at a kid just to be grown up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up

I can eat a pound and shit sixty four quarters
Burn up fire and drown drops of water
Son, I told you I got them beans like Goya
Gone off them pills got me jumping off the sofa
Hotter than a Hot Pocket out the devil microwave
Model bitches begging just be a nigga's sex slave
Exotic foreign garments lookin' tailor made
And when these bitches see me man they wetter than the everglades
Everyday same shit, me getting paid
Waking up, new bitch, it's me getting laid
Used to take bottle back, waitress bring the bottle back
Now they see me shining and they looking like a Sour Patch
Nigga catch a heart attack, Newport soft pack never blow blunt wraps
But these blunt raps sewn up

Most rappers hoping the world end so they won’t have to drop another album
B.b. King saw the king in me, so why can’t you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past fuck your Louis flag,
Popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass
That’s out of line, but in living color?

Bout' to feed her kids at night sleep between her legs and twist

Smokin' joints, lauging tryna get the part straight
For ten, put your perm in, don't scratch all day
Hot cocoa stove put the food in the bowl
Say that's how many nights it was hard to keep goin'

Danny Brown,"The thoughts all cloudy
In the marijuana sky, but it started raining molly
It got me feeling sorry while I'm feeling on myself
Cause I don't know this bitch name but I'm feeling on her breast
I know it ain't right, but in this state I don't care
A whole week done went past, I don't go nowhere
Hotel rooms crushing pills and menus
Daughter sending me messages saying ""Daddy, I miss you""
But in this condition I don't think she need to see me
Ain't slept in four days, and I'm smelling like seaweed
Problems in my past haunt my future and the present
Escaping from reality got me missing my blessings
Sent a couple G's but that make it no better
And now I got habits that ain't getting no better
And it ain't that easy trying to get all together
Been stressing so long think depression done settled

It's time for me to clean it up
I came too far to fuck it up like
It's time for me to clean it up
I came too far to fuck it up like

Pops left mom when I was only 18
So rightfully that meant I had to be the man of things
And by 28, mom was damn near homeless
And now I'm 31 she 'bout to fucking cop her own shit
Triple beam dreams brought me nothing but nightmares
Thought that I was helping but the system don't fight fair
Cases had me locked up, mama always wrote me
Pops my only visit, they the only ones that loved me
That's why I feel bad, popping Givenchy tags
Knowing that this tee could feed my nephew for a week
For material I'm weak, acting like I don't care
I spend it all on clothes, then something is wrong there
I sent my mom some G's, but that makes it no better

I done scraped myself with that razor
Gettin' head in that trick house and I snuck out without payin' her
Locked up in that precinct used my Timberland for a pillow
Break the dank in that swizzle ridin' round in a dope fiend rental
Pulling up on ya baby mama like bitch what you tryna get into
If you ain't about that suckin', then ho you can keep on trucking
I'm gettin' mine straight up no middle man nigga I don't like you
Fool's Gold the clique and musically we don't fuck with you
Went from holdin' crack in my ass crack
To racks on racks on ASCAP
Coulda rhymed ASCAP with ass capped
Jadakiss already said that
Do it for the days when for dinner
All a nigga had to eat was a couple of coneys
Broke as fuck and no bitch to fuck
In my basement jackin' off lonely
Used to fall off fuckin' with the work
But guess what? I'm back on ho
No more ? on that couch
Now I'm all the way in your bitch mouth
And I gag her till she cry
On her stomach fluid come up
I be fuckin' her face on the daily
You be kissin' that bitch in the mouth

Like open wide ho!
Open wide ho!
Open wide ho!
Open wide ho!

If I tell a bitch to do a flip in the air
Then land on my dick from the back
Look I ain't trippin', no, I ain't kiddin'
Have her lickin' my head like a cat
Now shut up bitch and get the Amber Rose
Come and let a young real nigga cut
But nah bitch this dick ain't free
So she copped my dick and then cuffed
Now come here chick and let me feed you nuts
Cum on her ass and have her lyin' in it
How her mouth can be wide as her legs
My dick is long as the Brooklyn bridge
Hit it raw cause I'm with the shit
Gave her the pipe said she need a fix
Gave you life, can't believe the sight
Take the wood like a termite
Made a crash up at the turnpike
But it's a rental I'll get another
Wonder if you got the gift from your mother
I used to play hoops with your brother
Even played a lil' house with your sister
She always call me daddy or mister mister
Why the ? shirts can do more than fist her
Bitch gettin' head, I ain't never kissed her
B I G never missed a beat
I was ? so I skeet skeet
Ho can make an orgasm last a week
I'mma get her deep, she a masterpiece
Hell no I don't love that bitch
Hell yeah I'm gon' enjoy that bitch
But I hope my daughter don't be like this
But I know her mama know that shit exist

But I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Remember when I was strugglin'
Fucked up on my knuckles
Tryin' to sell some dirt weed
Taxin' off a ten speed
Money wasn't comin'
For sure nigga I kept frontin'

I had them dubs on the step
Slow days, fast days, gettin' paper any way

And I kept lickin' on that clit
Till she gave me that shit
I've been fucked up for so long
Swear to God I gotta get it
I put my back into it
Servin' bags to them students
Tell 'em I got that fire
On that porch right there by the Buick
I'm just tryin' to get my mind
Go worry nigga 'bout yours
Rollin' up that swisher
Pourin' up a four
Servin' in them hallways
The courtrooms all day
Hoods kicked the door down
Now we in the Coney

I had them dubs on the step
Slow days, fast days, gettin' paper any way

It's the same old shit
Everybody in the manor is locked up, boxed up
It's killin' me
Niggas wanna get rid of me
Cause I lyrically bust on the riddim
Fill the room with humidity
Stick it in a manner, the heaviest rhythm bangin' out
Doubling my money gettin' my hustle in Canning Town
Listen up Danny Brown
I been doing this thing
Skipped in, then I come and lyrically assist 'em (WOO!)

A cup of lean for me to sleep, see I be going through thangs
Music business got me stressed Xanax to maintain
Waking up on wrong sides got me writing in vain
Vicodin to numb me up help me cope with the struggle
Remember praying to get in there saying rap to my brothers
And now I, got the whole world listening
Give your ear for a second a life changing decision
Every other minute thoughts run through my mind
'bout how bad I wanted this but I cannot waste time
So I'm trapped in the beat, stuck on every line
Nothing else matters, except my next rhyme
You can never understand all the pressure I'm against
Getting high thinking how to make it better than your last shit

Might have a mental breakdown
If it wasn't for these pills here now
And no matter how it gets I hold on
Rolling up this dope to cope I float on, nigga I float on

I float on
Let's go, hop up in the Chevy four-door, let's roll

Remember back when mommy sent me for the Wonder Bread
And niggas jumped me stomped on my fucking head
It's like I learned right then you either sink or you swim
And to beat your enemy, you gotta think like them
So I was up late breaking day with the gremlins
Music in my heart but my thoughts wouldn't listen
Hood outta bye-bye cause rap shit was sci-fi
So I'm tormented with the things I seen with these eyes
Can't get a wink 'less I'm leaning off of syrup
Dreaming of my past like a nightmare so I wake up
Staring at the ceiling with this feeling that won't go away
Until the verse is done wrote all day but them shit's throwaway
So I'm breaking day sniffing Adderall writing
And not for the money for the life after dying
Pray I get old just to hear I been the future
Just to see my influence in this genre of music

And might make it to see somehow
If it wasn't for these pills here now
And no matter how it gets I hold on

Tell your baby mama sorry, that was one night and please don't call me

I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation
Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma and my brain going on vacation

Danny Brown,"Hé bien peut-être l'oiseau
L'oiseau qui dormait en chacun de nous
S'élèvera

Hipster by heart but I can tell you how the streets feel
Everybody thirsty and they looking for a refill
If the gang eatin, guns barking at your doggie bag
Get took out for your take out now you carry out
Murder by delivery, married at the paramount
I just coughed up a fair amount
Of niggas might air it out
Judge a book by cover so we never educated
It ain't about racists poor and rich segregated
Just to get the bacon dawg, you gotta go HAM
Use to be lost til I found who I am
But it took the hook to eat the palm on my hands
Locked tryna get real creative with the spam
Locked in a jam cause a nigga serve butter
Just to get a little bread had to keep tomato smothered
All I really wanted was to overdub my vocals
But no one ever thought that I would take it past local
High a'top a totem man somebody shoulda' told 'em
That if money grow on trees being rich is dime a dozen

So I'm smoking by my lonely
By my goddamn self
I don't need your help homie
Cause don't nobody really know me
Said nobody really know me

See that's going on a limb
And I used to sell trees, and I used to rock Timbs
Radiohead shit, fiends with The Bends
Back when Granny used to tell me ""Stay Out of In""
Blaming cold air out, tryna know my whereabouts
Gone for three days and nobody ever heard about
How I got these Jordan's, but that ain't too important
When I got a bitch pregnant and I'm stacking for abortion
And all I really wanted was to give myself a portion
Lit up off the Henney got a nigga self absorbing
Smoking on a bogie, no bud style, who can I trust now?
Lady snitch and got the whole block down
Now we gon' eat now, no rebound, when your boxed out
Belly of the beast now
Now you got me feeling trapped and I can't look back
When the roller head is out and the Pabst is made of ash
And I'm going through the trash tryna' find a little treasure
Living for the better tryna get myself together

So I'm smoking by my lonely
By my goddamn self
I don't need your help homie
Cause don't nobody really know me
I said nobody really know me",Lonely,2013
Danny Brown,"Codeine in my cereal, always behind a smokey
I'm sorta like a miracle, you rappers are venereal
And never in my stereo, might spray your ass with vinegar
The next time that I see ya bro
Bet yo ass still won't be tight
The size of my dick nigga, every pussy tight
I write all night til the sun comes up
Dodging texts from yo sista tryna lick on my nuts
Cobra clutch the game, put that bitch into submission
Yo bitch want the stick shift, no transmission
Dawg, I'm on a mission, you're playing exhibition
On an expedition, poppin' X but never trippin'
Chillin' with a vixen, tryna stick my dick in
Red head ho, like a young Kathy Griffin
Smoked too many blunts, I can hear my lungs whistlin'
Still rollin' up, ho smellin' like chicken
Rap Martin Lawrence, all you other rappers boring
Bruiser make 2 Live Crew look like some mormons
Nigga my essay is hard like a life-doin' ese
Gang banging on the yard with a home made machete
The nicest cassette tapes, stay smokin' heavy
Popped a couple pills, eye's glowing like Belly
Used to stash the cracks in the seams of my Pelle
Detroit nigga, but I'm smokin' on LA

And is anybody nervous?
I'm red to go
I said I'm red to go
I said is anybody worried?
I'm red to go
Said I'm red to go
Is anybody scared?
I'm red to go
I said I'm red to go
Well I used to be afraid
I'm red to go
I said I'm red to go

Tired of where I came from but know where I'm goin'
Tears in my eyes cause I'm smokin' on an onion
Aroma on that 'etra scary and McNairy
Off of moon rocks in Barcelona poppin' cherries
Blowjobs from model twins
Doin' drugs with acronyms
So many lines thought this shit was bush garden
Party startin' monster with the hair like Blanka
Hotel room like a hair metal concert
This blonde made the dick do the spring on ?
You disrespect I hit you with the slap of Tatanka
Remember nigga used to eat shit that didn't match
Like cornbeef hash and some fuckin' Apple Jacks
Used to bag up the packs at ? every night
Bologna all night, with no peanut butter, couldn't waste it on the mic
So I waste every night, everything came with rice
And I knew I wouldn't write
So I got my ass up, fuck dependin' on luck
Greyhound to NY bout 300 bucks
Kept my hopes up but my confidence was low
Now my self esteem is astral
Lookin' at this cash flow

Did it my way, I ain't nobody ho
I'm bout to pimp the rap game
Bitch I'm red to go
Did it my way, I ain't nobody ho
I'm bout to pimp the rap game

But if they ever see me then they might have to duck, nigga
Like what, nigga? Before your ass can answer
Get your whole shit bust, nigga
Done rose out them ashes, drinking Fiji water
Wanna pull me in that fire when I'm tryna feed my daughter
Wanna snatch my mommas plate, and tell her she can't eat
And we gone have us some discrepancies right here in this skreet
Because the weak don't speak, get left in silence
And when you don't listen, gotta speak with violence
And duct tape the grandmama, strip a man of all his honor
Out here tryna be a G, now you wish you a goner
I walk with the Gods with the tongues of the devil
Tryna keep a nigga thirsty so for rain I pray mercy

The return of the gangsta 'cause niggas don't believe
I roll hotter than my sleeve, leave a nigga in the street
The return of the gangster cause niggas got bills
This rap shit don't work then its back to selling krills
Return of the gangster cause niggas want that real
Want that old Danny Brown but nigga I'm like chill
Return of the gangster fucked that hipster squeeze the trigger
You got me fucked up I'm a hood ass nigga

Eastside niggas keep roaches in the ashtray
Twenty thousand out the public housing on a bad day
Drop it in the pot, if it ain't lockin' that's some bad yay
Tryna save my soul I wish the lord would meet me half way
Devil on my shoulder as I'm whipping up this yola
And that motor hit the rotor ship this blow to Minnesota
Only option is a shoot out if the police pull me over
This shit get real as shit thats on your Playstation controller
Call of Duty ass nigga, dick in the booty ass nigga
Don't po' up roll no dough up and I don't get no cash witcha
Feel like fuck the world it ain't no friends up in this business
Fuck my label show them that I'm the real realest nigga in it

It was me and Baby James

Put Peanut Butter on her pussy, let his pits lick it off
Back when I was living on Flanders
Seen another dope fiend beat another with a hammer
Remember at the park, seen a nigga at a payphone
Got rocked in his dome, momma picked me up and ran home
Was like fucking seven years old
When I first seen a fiend try to light a rock off the stove
Damn near burned his top lip off, so my mind ticked off
Desensitized to a lotta things, mind would drift off
Wish it was what I seen on tv, I snapped outta that
Unc' beating on my auntie
Gunshots outside was sorta like fireworks
We know they ain't fireworks, its December 21'st
Cold winter with a kerosene heater on the couch so cold
Can't take off your sneakers

And it's torture

Look in my mind and see the horrors

I feel like a prisoner of war
Reacting sporadically to what the mind absorb
Probably need a shrink, can't get a wink
So I smoke a lot of kush and pop a Xanax to sleep
Close my eyes, look up, fiend said 1 for 8
Can tell that I scared him by the look on my face
Reached in my pocket served him nervous as a surgeon
Can't believe where I'm at 'pose be writin' verses
Heard a knock at the do', 'Nother fiend wanted fo'
Gave him what he came for, told him go to the sto'
Lemme get a box a box of Swishers, Faygo Cola
Gave his ass another stone now guess what it's over
He ain't come back, before I could look back
I heard the wood on the door crack, and they yelling police

Said go get some bread and a pop and come back
Walk out the door first thing I see

Standing right there in front of the porch
With a pipe in his hand and the other a torch
I kept on moving ain't worried bout that
But a block later heard ""rat-tat-tat-tat""
Next, some niggas from over there shootin'
Dog I ain't blinked just kept it a-movin'
Block later up: What do I find?

Grabbed what I needed, left out the do'

My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in the vet
Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
Got the ball in my hand and the ball in the net
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offence dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected, my mama gated community's overprotected
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet fifty shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah coupons
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Or takin' down my number like ""you still ain't got a new line?""
Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than 9 months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though
Don't want to, I need to,gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part 1, wait 'til the sequel

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (Statik)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (Statik)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (Statik)
Detroit vs. Everybody

Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from felon, that's why they call it the D
On your bleeder, ho, reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honor the Phantom stripper pole
'Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas say
Put a sack on your head, you bleed out like the reverend
And to think our hood harder then I might break the door
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Molly
In a blink I'll hit your kisser, bet you ass ain't rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
I kings bout that scuba but I ain't get to no betterin'
Cough up a line, 313 where I'm from
Zan got me cross eyed like Bernstein’s son
And these niggas try to copy but I hold on this time
It's us vs them, Detroit vs Everybody yeah

Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like AB filler
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
I ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC the shit
Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage
You crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? 'Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track I spank like he just did
(Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like me and shit, but Jesus
I can just see why people stop callin' me to do features
And them cyphers on BET 'cause if
I wasn't me I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch, 180 Degrees in here
Trying to wait for the cedar chips
Mcs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and genius, this inconvenience
And for the record, you won't want this kind of static
In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it
They consider tryna reinsulate yah
When it's maybe in for another crazy winter
It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde
But ain't we sick of bein' underdog
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit may even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with your relation, changin' it it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter
With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety center
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here?
And if they mention us

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (Statik)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (Statik)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (Statik)
Detroit vs. Everybody

What up doe
It's the godfather Trick Trick
You either ridin' with us
Or gettin' rolled on
That means Detroit vs. Everybody!
Hey Em
Let me get that instrumental take it down to the hood
Let the little homies get this remix crackin'
Detroit!
Okay",Detroit vs. Everybody,2014

Blocking the flat screen while I'm watching Juice

Q and the DJ battle, move or I scratch you

Got them selling dimes still shiny as a nickel
Pistol in designer pants, shoeboxes in bedrooms
Some got stacks but most discontinued

Bark on a nigga with the blade out
Run up in your safehouse, how ironic
Knock a ring on a nigga like somebody hit Sonic

Skinny or big jeans, niggas they still sag
Brag about 2 chains, 4 chains, 6 chains
Spread eagle bitches in the crib giving brain
Still keep them Clarks crispier than printed money
And the Champion gear that I rock? Will hide my face for me

Had a threesome last night, ain’t matter what it cost
Couldn’t it get hard, tried to stuff it in soft
Had to fuck em both raw, keep my fingers crossed

I’m a give em hell for it
For whatever it’s worth
My nigga
I'm a give em hell

Cause we living in that
Actavis double cups was addicted to that
Had them demons on my back
Was escaping through that
Blamed everybody but myself
Apologies for that
So they hold a nigga back
For the way that I act
People scared of doing business
Thinking I smoke crack
I react immature
To anyone talking smack
Cause where I'm from respect
The only thing that you have
Grew up virtually poor
Realities unmasked
So my task
Is inspire your future with my past
I lived through that shit
So you don’t have to go through it
Stepping stones in my life
Hot coals
Walk with me
Listen when I speak
Every time talk with me
Couple screws loose
You don't wanna start
With me
Got it from Motown
Feel David Ruffin pain
Wanna cry right now            
So I’m wishing that it rain
Cause I’m knowing I’m the best
They compare skills to sales
Tell myself everyday
Know this shit ain’t real
Radio don’t make you ill
They get a hit a they feel they self
Respect for lyricism
In this game ain’t none left
Have a bitch like Iggy
Think she sicker than me
And that’s so fucked up
That’s just how this shit be
I just wanna make music
Fuck being a celebrity
Cause these songs that I write
Leave behind my legacy

And I'm a give em hell for it
Until it's heaven on earth
My nigga
I'm a give em hell for it
For whatever it’s worth
My nigga
I'm a give em hell for it
Unless death come first

With 2 bricks
And hoes on the strip
Off a 2 piece
A toothpick I flick
And I preach
Bout how I’m a get this money out here up in the streets
In the Caddy Ron Isley on between in the sheets
And a way a nigga work make a grip in a week
I’m a chill with this freak
Sniff a gram and a half
Plus her pussy juicier than Shalamar curl bag
While she draw me a bath
Roll a blunt then passed
Giggled and jiggled her booty
Couldn’t do nothing but laugh
Credit cards separating
White lines on a mirror
Roll a 100 dollar bill
Now my sinus all clearer
Flat screen porn on
Watching Asa Akira
Nothing on but my pinky ring
Sniff when I get up
On the balcony drunk
Like the world is mine
Staggering inside with my robe untied

So fuck waiting round
Nigga I’m about to get it
Dog I’m tryna eat
So I’m staying in the kitchen
Hunched over the stove
Gotta water water whip it
Lost in the sauce but a nigga still stirring
Packing up them bags but a nigga ain't tripping
Lost in the sauce but a nigga still dipping
Lost on the sauce but a nigga ain’t flipping
Cutting up the hard like the yard ain’t filling

I'm like Spielberg
With ill words and hoes on that curb
Gotta screw loose
I'm cuckoo
Mentally disturbed
But still smart enough
To hit this bitch wit a rubber
And with ya wrinkle pussy
Hoe can’t be ya lover
But I still get the head
If you swallow with bubbles
I'm a Linwood nigga I done traveled the world
Made a name for myself use to serve on the curb
Now my words worth a bird
I could front you a zip
Made a million in a year and I still ain’t trip
Bout to put my niggas on make a million for them
Show you that you can make it without acting like them
Do you lil nigga go out there and just get it
Gotta have a hardback
Because these niggas gon’ whip it
Do you lil nigga get up out there get it

Show me somethin' I ain't seen before
That hoe want my piccolo
Smoking on that mistletoe
Make her kiss all on it while we cha-cha, but on 24's
She look like a centerfold
Mouth all on my genitals
Suckin' on it like she gettin' vitamins and minerals
I be on the chemicals, she be on my testicles
Poke her with my tentacle then put her on my schedule
Rolling up them vegetables
Rapping with that special flow
Only way you're next to blow if you be strapped with C4
I be fresh from head to toe, every day a fashion show
Used to tote that Calico and serve like John McEnroe
Now I sell out all my shows
Used to sell out all my blow

For heaven's sake, I'm the GOAT, you haters can go to hell
When you're getting money, nigga, every day is sunny
I'ma act an ass on that donkey, let her pull my ponytail
Second grade, took my mama weddin' ring, took that bitch
To show-and-tell, now I'm married to the game to no avail
Grounded me for like a month, now I'm gettin' high as fuck
Employer tryna write me up, but now I'm a writer
With ambitions of a rider, and half the shit on my rider I don't even want
The Fanta's for us, the Henny's for the sluts (chyeah)
Givenchy bikers with the Raf rips
Balmain badmon, Bathing Ape on my dick
Paid by the Bloods, raised by the Crips
Soulo Ho the prophecies, atrocities, exhibition

Life is like an appetite of truth and dare, I double dare ya
Life can end in vain before the end is near
See I can hear you crying
Silence sittin' in the dark
Holdin' crosses 'cross your heart
Sin is such a work of art
Watch out for the love lost
Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand
Things a nigga do for thousands
Made a million counting sheep
Gave it all to public housin'
Taking off to Abu Dhabi
Beamin' up the motor, Scotty
Talking to promoters, Scotty
Everybody know it's Gotti
Murder one, you've heard of them
The Revenant, the all day madness
Got it off to wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress
Big power, big stages
My zoo cannot fit the cages
This booth is not used to fakin'
My crew just love confrontation
I chewed the face off the laces
I moved the weight from the waitress
I chef the pot that made poison
I cooked then tipped all the patients
My bitch is way beyond basic
That's life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance
Aye, look what I ain't doin'
Aye, ridin' in foreigns
Aye, K-Dot, four years, I got the same watch
But it's the real watch and that bitch fire
Speed Racer waitin' outside
The roof on it like a tank top
Countin' money, watchin' paint dry
When I'm done is when the rain stops, uh

So I could pop in the clutch

And I'm the type of nigga it ain't never been an honor to judge
You a mouse that the falcon picked up
So disrespect and gettin' checked like the top of the month
I was a liar as a kid so now I'm honest as fuck
And I never passed my mama no blunt, it kept my head straight
Less than deadweight, never been a problem to dump
Look, I just broke up with my bitch cause we ain't argue enough
I keep it dirty as the spliffs my uncle Alchemist puff
I strike a birdie on 'em, while I hit your mouth with the club
I wake up early on 'em, gettin' out the house is a must
It's like a sweaty pit, sweaty sit, countin' your dubs
Either that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks
Loungin', ask your girl why her mouth on my nuts
You've been the same motherfucker since 2001

Know I'm just nigga rich

Bought a nightmare, sold a dream
Happiness went upstream
Blame myself, I had no control

I'm on a road that never ends
Don't know opposite of sin
Some people say I think too much
I don't think they think enough
Time rough but it got rougher
Weight heavier up on my shoulders
Living crooked 'til it's over
Can't be straight, can't be sober
Thought process so immature
Can't make it up, up out the sewer
Feeling like there's no hope
Blaze dope, my mind float
I love her, she love me
Love ain't enough with no bucks
Fucked up, that's the way it is
I don't know who I should trust

Lost my brain, going insane
Self-medicate is how I cope
Leave my body, soul go afloat
On a roll that never ends
Don't know where I should begin
Feeling trapped, no looking back
Head first in that deep end

When I die, I leave alone
Getting high, I feel low

I will leave your face out of my mind
You should save your eyes
A thousand voices howling in my head

Speak in tongues
I don’t even recognize your face
Riddle on the wall
Tell me all the ways to stay away

Ey ey ey ah
Away ey ah
Away ey ah
And stay
Away ey ah
Away ey ah
Away ey ah

Dig a hole
Fireworks exploding in my hands
If I could paint the sky
All the stars would shine upon in red

Stay
Ey ey ey ah
Away ey ah
Away ey ah
And stay
Ey ey ey ah

You know you've been on
Though I'm keepin' come, I'm not on
Go away my love
Thought I could change our fate
I tried again, but there's delay
It's more than I can take

And it got to me
When you state your love
And you walk away
What could you be on?
Now you're not around
But I hope you see
I will be full-on
If it's up to me
That's all I got-

Feels so good doin' me
If you take a look at the time you took and move on
But don't go too far, my love
We could try harder, baby
There's gotta be a better way
So much that we could make it

And you got to me
When you state your love
But you run away
What could you be on?

Gotta be full-on
It is up to me
That's all I got

That's all I got (that's all I got, that's all I got)

Wish I could think of better ways
'Cause I lost my patience yesterday
If you could see inside of me
There'd be no heart on my X-ray
Opponents tryna checkmate
But I don't see no escape
Just tryna keep my head straight
On thin ice with the ice skates
At times I feel like giving up
'Cause it feels like I've had enough
Felt like my soul in handcuffs
Got questions with no answers
Can't help me out, I need a friend
I'm losing faith in this world of sin
Tryna make ends meet with a week, no sleep
It's like a cycle that never ends
I can't pretend with no handling
I can't take care of no grown man
All by myself, crying out for help
But won't get saved by no Superman
All comes down to the mighty dollar
Greed and lust, abusing power
Clock is ticking, hour after hour
Maybe when I throw my hands, I'll holla

But you run away
What could you be on?

Get pearl tongue like every day, so I Run them Jewels in every state

No bitch on my ding-a-ling when she ride on it she wet like a jet-ski

Put the D on, no Warwick

Cayenne truck, watch me floor it
Eating calamari with the swordfish
Penthouse enormous
Doing blow in silk garments

Writing like Shakespeare on the top tier
10 in life bid with his shank near
To be or not to be thats what the question is

Evident I'm heaven sent but hell bent
Two licks, her pussy wetter than whale piss

Murder, death, kill pull a one 87
If you ain't gon' give it motherfucker I'ma take it
Boy I'll turn ya' to a raisin
Just to bring home the bacon
For me to see heaven I would need to meet Satan
So my heart so vacant
My mind's on some 'take shit! Break shit! Spray shit!'
In some raw day shit
Face-lift braces, unsolved cases
Hittin' up the witnesses so can't nobody say shit
I think the reaper callin'
Picked up the phone and said
""I got a couple coming""
'Cause blood in my eye and I'm thirsty for death
(?) walking up heaven's steps
Got a getaway driver, just chillin' in a stolen
Parolee with a 40 that'll take what you owe me
'Cause I'm no (?)
And the last thing yo' ass wanna hear is these words

Guns are in the trunk
Money in the seat
Guns are in the trunk
Think they gonna and get us, never
Uh, the white OJ in the hallway
The long .44 spray
One leg up on the Velour grey
Gettin' straddled while I'm eatin' strudle
We fuck you up so bad that you will never take a normal doo-doo
Or a pee-pee, bedridden
Now I'm laughing while head is given
No fucks are given ever cause I'm rotten to the core
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya right into the door
Aah, cross the street when you see us by the store
I'm off the leash, dick hanging on the floor
Box cutters rolled up in the waistband of the 09's
You thought you had your little shit
Clickin' now, but no mas

Strong features in the face from New Guinea

So I'm flyin' down to Houston 
Forgetting her's the nature of my flight

As we taxi toward the runway 
With the smog and haze 
Reminding me of how I feel
Just a country boy who's learnin' 
That the pitfalls of the city 
Are extremely real

All the night life and the parties 
And temptation and deceit 
The order of the day
Well it's a bloody Mary mornin' 
'Cause I'm leavin' baby somewhere in LA

Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning 
Sometime in the night
So I'm flyin' down to Houston 
Forgetting her's the nature of my flight

Our golden jet is airborne 
And flight fifty cuts a path 
Across the mornin' sky
And a voice comes through the speaker 
Reassuring us flight fifty 
Is the way to fly

And a hostess takes our order 
Coffee, tea or something stronger 
To start off the day
Well it's a bloody Mary morning 
'Cause I'm leavin' baby somewhere in LA

Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning 
Sometime in the night
So I'm flyin' down to Houston 
Forgetting her's the nature of my flight
Yeah I'm flyin' down to Houston 
Forgetting her's the nature of my flight",Bloody Mary Morning,1980
Danny Davis,"This looks like a December day
This looks like a ""time to remember"" day
And I remember the spring, such a sweet tender thing
And love's summer college,
Where the green leaves of knowledge,
Were waiting to fall with the fall

And where September wine,
Numbed the measure of time
Through the tears of October, now November's over,
And this looks like a December day 

This looks like a December day
It looks like we've come to the end of the way
And as my memories race back to love's eager beginning,
Reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending
The ending that won't go away

Aren't you lonely since our darling disappeared

And up and down our block there's not a sound
I close my eyes and search for peaceful slumber
And just then the local memory comes around

Piles of blues against the door to make sure sleep will come no more
She's the hardest working memory in this town
Turns out happiness again and then lets loneliness back in
And each night the local memory comes around

Each day I say tonight I may escape her
I pretend I'm happy and never even frown
But at night I close my eyes and pray sleep finds me
But again the local memory comes around

Rids the house of all good news then sets out my crying shoes
What a faithful memory never lets me down
We're both up till light of day chasing happiness away
And each night the local memory comes around

Piles of blues against the door to make sure sleep will come no more

Don't doubt my love if sometimes my mind should wonder
To a suddenly remembered yesterday

If you're running from it brother the only road that I can see

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

We'll watch you suffer slow
On a trestle cut muscle vessels

Danny Dill,"Two partners went in search of gold
As friendly as could be
One was young and one was old
And the gay young fool was me

Since neither one could write his name
We swore upon our souls
To share the wealth and then shook hands
The hands that dug for gold
(Oh partners)

The summer days were gone at last
And winter nights grew cold
The snow had trapped us in the pass
When we finally find the gold

We took our fortune to the shack
To wait the winter through
But the food ran low so I killed my friend
What else was there to do?
(Oh partners)

I threw his body just outside
Into the bitter cold
Somehow I had to stay alive
I now had all the gold

But the howling wind just seemed to say
You have killed a man
And you'll never get to spend the gold
With the blood upon your hands
(Oh partners)

The cabin's covered now with snow
And shelves of food are bare
Satan's waitin' for me now
And I'm too cold to care

Is that the devil at the door
Coming for my soul
Or is it just the old man
A looking for his gold?

Looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""son
What is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else
You won't have to die""

Well I spoke not a word
Although it meant my life
For I had been in the arms
Of my best friend's wife

In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

And eternity near
She stood in the crowd
And shed not a tear

But sometimes at night
When the cold wind moans
In a long black veil
She cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills

She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Reminds me of the memories I wish I never had
Standing in a crowded room too dark for me to see
Someone's pushing from behind, just leave me room to
breathe

And go away from me, just go away
To another time, another place
To another world, another dream
Go away from me

Walking down the sidewalk in a crowd that doesn't care
Bumping into shoulders every eye is on the street
There's a man with tattered clothes who's cursing at
the air
Everyone is slowing down to catch a little peak

And go away from me, just go away
To another time, another place
To another world, another dream
Go away from me

Every time I wake up and I see myself again
Staring in the mirror like a burnt out piece of wood
Searching every feature for a single trace of life
Couldn't find the answer 'cause the mirror never lies

And go away from me, just go away

To another world, another dream

You let me get my hopes too high
But now you're happy

Crazy kind of feeling, hanging from the ceiling
With a bag tied over my head
You won't let the sun shine in
But now you're very very happy that you're so happy
Very very happy for you
Looking round every corner
Look, I'm glad you're happy

Got to get while I'm still alive

We're simply meant to be",The Finale,1992
Danny Elfman,"And finally, everything worked out just fine.
Christmas was saved, though there wasn't much time.
But after that night, things were never the same,
Each holiday now knew the other one's name.

And though that one Christmas things got out of hand,
I'm still rather fond of that skeleton man.

So, many years later I thought I'd drop in,
And there was old Jack still looking quite thin,
With four or five skeleton children at hand
Playing strange little tunes in their xylophone band.

And I asked old Jack, ""Do you remember the night
When the sky was so dark and the moon shone so bright?
When a million small children pretending to sleep
Nearly didn't have Christmas at all, so to speak?
And would, if you could, turn that mighty clock back,
To that long, fateful night. Now, think carefully, Jack.
Would you do the whole thing all over again,
Knowing what you know now, knowing what you knew then?""

And he smiled, like the old pumpkin king that I knew,
Then turned and asked softly of me, ""Wouldn't you?""",Closing (End Title),1993
Danny Elfman,"There are few who'd deny, at what I do I am the best
For my talents are renowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
I excel without ever even trying
With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With the wave of my hand, and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet

Yet year after year, it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing

Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones
An emptiness began to grow
There's something out there, far from my home
A longing that I've never known

I'm a master of fright, and a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France

And since I am dead, I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations

But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown, if they only understood
He'd give it all up if he only could

Oh, there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise come year after year
Does nothing for these empty tears",Jack's Lament,1993

Christmas time is buzzing in my skull
Will it let me be? I cannot tell
There are so many things I cannot grasp
When I think I've got it, and then at last
Through my bony fingers it does slip
Like a snowflake in a fiery grip

Something's here I'm not quite getting
Though I try, I keep forgetting
Like a memory long since past
Here in an instant, gone in a flash
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked
These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though

Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door
Though I do not have the key
Something's there I cannot see
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
Hmm...

I've read these Christmas books so many times
I know the stories and I know the rhymes
I know the Christmas carols all by heart
My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart
As often as I've read them, something's wrong
So hard to put my bony finger on

Or perhaps it's really not as deep
As I've been led to think
Am I trying much too hard?
Of course! I've been too close to see
The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me

It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air
Invisible, but everywhere
Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it

You know, I think this Christmas thing
It's not as tricky as it seems
And why should they have all the fun?
It should belong to anyone

Not anyone, in fact, but me
Why, I could make a Christmas tree
And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmas time

I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do
Hee,hee,hee
Eureka! I've got it",Jack's Obsession,1993

I wanna do it
Let's draw straws

Three of a kind
Birds of a feather
Now and forever
Wheeee
(La, la, la
La, la, la)

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then
Turn off all the lights

First, we're goin' to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing we will
Snap the trap and close the gate

Wait, I've got a better plan
To catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box
Bury him for ninety years
Then see if he talks

Then Mr. Oogie Boogie man
Can take the whole thing over then
He'II be so pleased, I do declare
That he will cook him rare, wheee

I say that we take a cannon, aim it at his door
And then knock three times
And when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more

Yes you're so stupid, think now
If we blow him up to smithereens
We may lose some pieces
And then Jack will beat us black and green

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean
Then, see if he is sad

Because Mr. Oogie Boogie
Is the meanest guy around
If I were on his boogie list
I'd get out of town

He'II be so pleased by our success
That he'll reward us too, I bet
Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew

We're his little henchmen and
We take our job with pride
We do our best to please him
And stay on his good side

I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb
I'm not the dumb one
You're no fun
Shut up
Make me
I've got something, listen now
This one is real good, you'll see

We'II send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now, in the box we'll wait and hide
Until' his curiosity
Entices him to look inside
And then we'll have him
One, two, three

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Beat him with a stick
Lock him up for ninety years, see what
Makes him tick

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Chop him into bits
Mr. Oogie Boogie
Is sure to get his kicks

Kidnap the sandy claws
See what we will see
Lock him in a cage
And then throw away the key",Kidnap the Sandy Claws,1993

Like a most improbable dream

But you must believe when I tell you this
It's as real as my skull and it does exist

Everyone, please now, not so fast
There's something here that you don't quite grasp
Well, I may as well give them what they want

And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last
For the ruler of this Christmas land
Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice
Least that's what I've come to understand

And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold
Like a lobster, huge and red
And sets out to slay with his rain gear on
Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms
That is, so I've heard it said

And on a dark, cold night
Under full moonlight
He flies into a fog
Like a vulture in the sky
And they call him Sandy Claws

Well, at least they're excited
Though they don't understand

What's this? What's this?

There are people singing songs

Little creatures laughing

There are children throwing snowballs
Instead of throwing heads
They're busy building toys
And absolutely no one's dead

There's frost on every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes
And in my bones I feel the warmth
That's coming from inside

Oh, look
What's this?
They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss
Why that looks so unique, inspired

They're gathering around to hear a story
Roasting chestnuts on a fire

In here they've got a little tree, how queer
And who would ever think
And why?

They're covering it with tiny little things
They've got electric lights on strings
And there's a smile on everyone
So, now, correct me if I'm wrong

This looks like fun
This looks like fun
Oh, could it be I got my wish?
What's this?

Oh my, what now?
The children are asleep
But look, there's nothing underneath
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them
Or ensnare them, only little cozy things
Secure inside their dreamland

What's this?

The monsters are all missing
And the nightmares can't be found
And in their place there seems to be
Good feeling all around
Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air
The smell of cakes and pies
Are absolutely everywhere

The sights, the sounds
They're everywhere and all around
I've never felt so good before
This empty place inside of me is filling up
I simply cannot get enough
I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own

Danny Elfman,"And finally, everything worked out just fine.
Christmas was saved, though there wasn't much time.
But after that night, things were never the same,
Each holiday now knew the other one's name.

And though that one Christmas things got out of hand,
I'm still rather fond of that skeleton man.

So, many years later I thought I'd drop in,
And there was old Jack still looking quite thin,
With four or five skeleton children at hand
Playing strange little tunes in their xylophone band.

And I asked old Jack, ""Do you remember the night
When the sky was so dark and the moon shone so bright?
When a million small children pretending to sleep
Nearly didn't have Christmas at all, so to speak?
And would, if you could, turn that mighty clock back,
To that long, fateful night. Now, think carefully, Jack.
Would you do the whole thing all over again,
Knowing what you know now, knowing what you knew then?""

And he smiled, like the old pumpkin king that I knew,
Then turned and asked softly of me, ""Wouldn't you?""",Closing,2008
Danny Elfman,"'Twas a long time ago, longer now than it seems
In a place that perhaps you've seen in your dreams
For the story that you are about to be told
Began in the holiday worlds of old

Now, you've probably wondered where holidays come from
If you haven't, I'd say it's time you begun
For holidays are the result of much fuss
And hard work for the worlds that create them for us
Well, you see now, quite simply that's all that they do
Making one unique holiday, especially for you
But once, a calamity ever so great occurred
When two holidays met by mistake",Opening,2008

How could I be so blind?

Find a deep cave to hide in
In a million years they'll find me

Well, what the heck, I went and did my best
And, by God, I really tasted something swell
And for a moment, why, I even touched the sky

At least those of you who still got an ear
I'll tell you a story that'll make a skeleton cry

But don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay
And you might try and hide
And you might try and pray
But we all end up the remains of the day

Yeah yeah yeah

Well our girl is a beauty known for miles around
When a mysterious stranger came into town
He's plenty good-looking, but down on his cash
And our poor little baby, she fell hard and fast
When her daddy said no, she just couldn't cope
So our lovers came up with a plan to elope

So they conjured up a plan to meet late at night
They told not a soul, kept the whole thing tight
Now, her mother's wedding dress fit like a glove
You don't need much when you're really in love
Except for a few things, or some told
Like the family jewels and a satchel of gold
Then next to the graveyard by the old oak tree
On a dark foggy night at a quarter to three
She was ready to go, but where was he?

And then?

She waited

And then?

There in the shadows, was it her man?

And then?

Her little heart beat so loud

And then?

And then baby, everything went black

Now when she opened her eyes she was dead as dust
Her jewels were missing and her heart was bust
So she made a vow lying under that tree
That she'd wait for her true love to come set her free
Always waiting for someone to ask for her hand
When out of the blue comes this groovy young man
Who vows forever to be by her side
And that's the story of our own corpse bride

Die, die we all pass away
But don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay

And you might try and pray

Du fliegst in den Höhen und fällst oft tief (und fällst oft tief)
Fast alles, was du anfängst, ging bisher schief (ging bisher schief)
Du machst so viele Fehler, die schmerzhaft sind
Und keiner sagt mehr „Das kann passieren mein Kind""
Doch du musst nur aus diesen Fehlern lernen
Dann können sich die Fehler und die Niederschläge ruhig noch mehren
Denn irgendwann wird sich das Ganze dann ins Gegenteil verkehren
Und du wirst lange Zeit später von deinen Fehlern zehren
Du nennst sie dann Erfahrungsschatz und hältst sie in Ehren
Denn den Zutritt dorthin kann dir keiner verwehren
Also vergiss nicht, wo du her kommst, und verfolge ein Ziel
Und sammle Bonuspunkte in diesem Lebensspiel

Spiel fair und denk groß
Scheiß auf alle, leg los
Denn sie behindern dich bloß

His weight outweighs the world

To raise His hands in victory for all of you and me

Danny Gatton,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Danny Gatton,"How many times have you heard someone say 
""If I had his money, I could do things my way?"" 
Little they know that it's so hard to find 
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind. 

Once I was waitin' for fortune and fame 
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game 
Suddenly it happened, I lost every dime 
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind 

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old 
Or a friend when you're lonely, or a love that's grown cold 
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times 
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind 

When my life is ended, my time has run out 
My trials and my loved ones, I'll leave them no doubt 
But one thing's for certain, when it comes my time 
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind 
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

This is one on me
Took my gal to a dance 
At the armory
Music played, dancers swayed
Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""

I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""

At the end of this tunnel
I've been searching for a sign
To lead me home

Too many endless nights
Of sorrow
But on the other side of this

The lesser I question
All the things I just can't see
Right in front of my eyes

And learn a few lessons
Time showed me that
What you give is what you get

I never saw a man that walked on the water

On silver wings at 20,000 feet
Where lakes and streams and fields of green
I tend to think the most peculiar things

Ribbons of highways, side roads and byways
People going all ways, always in a hurry
Gotta get there, but just where, from up here
I'm not sure, where it's all going or what it all means

I close my eyes and I realize all I really need
Is a love I had, and the love I had to give

And some days are better than some days
Can't see the sky, sky scrapers too high

The friends we have in our short time here
It's knowing Gods grace, the touch of a hand
Holding a baby, calling mom and dad

And getting to live long enough to look back
On the years, the sweet tears of joy and laughter

Danny Gottlieb,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much

A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Or it's quiet or it's mad;
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,2004
Danny Gottlieb,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2004

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed""

In the morning and started to laugh

Love came, planning to stay

She is smiling alone
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was

Someone mutters, and a streetlamp gutters,
And soon it will be morning.

I must wait for the sunrise
And I mustn't give in.
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smokey days

The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is

Has begun",Memory [From Cats],1998

Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love,

Go down to Louisiana and get you some
You’ll find her cutting cane all down the line
I got a cotton picker, she’s really fine

At the French tra-la it's all the same

Things that you would not do at home come nat'rally on the floor

Come out all right if the girl is sweet

The decks are trimmed with gold,
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold.

And rubies fill each bin,
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in.

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring,
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing.

Is my two front teeth

Have my two front teeth

Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
the story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,

two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Danny Kaye,"Each morning, a missionary advertises neon sign
He tells the native population that civilization is fine
And three educated savages holler from a bamboo tree
That civilization is a thing for me to see

 So bongo, bongo, bongo, I don't want to leave the congo, oh no no no no no
 Bingo, bangle, bungle, I'm so happy in the jungle, I refuse to go
 Don't want no bright lights, false teeth, doorbells, landlords, I make it clear
 (That no matter how they coax him) I'll stay right here

I looked through a magazine the missionary's wife concealed 
(Magazine, what happens)
I see how people who are civilized bung you with automobile
(You know you can get hurt that way Daniel)
At the movies they have got to pay many coconuts to see 
(What do they see, darling)
Uncivilized pictures that the newsreel takes of me

 So bongo, bongo, bongo, he don't want to leave the congo, oh no no no no no
 Bingo, bangle, bungle, he's so happy in the jungle, he refuse to go
 Don't want no penthouse, bathtub, streetcars, taxis, noise in my ear
(So, no matter how they coax him) I'll stay right here

They hurry like savages to get aboard an iron train
And though it's smokey and it's crowded, they're too civilized to complain
When they've got two weeks vacation, they hurry to vacation ground
(What do they do, darling)
They swim and they fish, but that's what I do all year round

 So bongo, bongo, bongo, I don't want to leave the congo, oh no no no no no
 Bingo, bangle, bungle, I'm so happy in the jungle, I refuse to go
 Don't want no jailhouse, (shotgun) fish hooks (golf clubs) I got my spears

Danny Kaye,"There once was an ugly duckling 
With feathers all stubby and brown 
And the other birds said in so many words 

Get out of town 
Get out, get out, get out of town 
And he went with a quack and a waddle and a quack 
In a flurry of eiderdown 

That poor little ugly duckling 
Went wandering far and near 
But at every place they said to his face 
Now get out, get out, get out of here 
And he went with a quack and a waddle and a quack 

And a very unhappy tear 
All through the wintertime he hid himself away 
Ashamed to show his face, afraid of what others might say 
All through the winter in his lonely clump of wheat 
Till a flock of swans spied him there and very soon agreed 

You’re a very fine swan indeed! 
A swan? Me a swan? Ah, go on! 
And he said yes, you’re a swan 
Take a look at yourself in the lake and you’ll see 
And he looked, and he saw, and he said 
I am a swan! Whee!

I’m not such an ugly duckling 
No feathers all stubby and brown 
For in fact these birds in so many words said 
The best in town, the best, the best 
The best in town 

Not a quack, not a quack, not a waddle or a quack 
But a glide and a whistle and a snowy white back 
And a head so noble and high 
Say who’s an ugly duckling? 

Not I! 
Not I!",The Ugly Duckling,1992
Danny Kaye,"Your majesty, I have a confession
My secret I must now betray
I was not a born fool
It took work to get this way

When I was a lad I was gloomy and sad
And I was from the day I was born
When other lads giggled and gurgled and wiggled
I proudly was loudly forlorn
My friends and my family looked at me clammily
Thought there was something amiss
When others found various antics hilarious
All I could manage was this? ho ho
Or this? ho waahhh

My father he shouted he needs to be clouted
His teeth on a wreath I?ll hand him
My mother she cried as she rushed to my side
You?re a brute and you don?t understand him
So they send for a witch with a terrible twitch
To ask how my future impressed her
She took one look at me and cried hehehehehe, he?
What else could he be but a jester?
A jester a jester, a funny idea a jester
No butcher no baker no candlestick maker
And me with the look of a fine undertaker
Impressed her as a jester?

Now where could I learn any comical turn
That was not in a book on the shelf
No teacher to take me and mold me and make me
A merryman fool or an elf
But I?m proud to recall that in no time at all
With no other recourses but my own resources
With firm application and determination
I made a fool of myself!

I bought a little gun and I learned to shoot
I bought a little a horn and I learned to toot
Now I can shoot and toot ain't that cute?  Plbbt!

I started to travel to try to unravel
My mind and to find a new chance

When I got to Spain it was suddenly plain
That the field that appealed was the dance
The Spanish were clannish but I wouldn't vanish
I learned every step they had planned
The first step of all isn't hard to recall
Cause the first step of all is to stand
And stand
And stand, and stand, and stand, and stand, and
They sometimes stand this way for days

Then they get very mad at the floor and start to stomp on it

[Smash! Ow!]

After all of my practice the terrible fact is
I made a fool of myself

I sadly decided that dancing as I did
To sing was a thing that was sure
I found me a teacher a crotchety creature
Who used to sing coloratura
She twisted my chin pushed my diaphragm in
With a poker she vocalized me
When she said it was best that I threw out my chest
You may gather that rather surprised me

I was on solid ground till I suddenly found
That in Venice I was to appear
The gala locale was a choppy canal
And me, a high sea gondolier
I nervously perched as the gondola lurched
Before the King?s palazzo
As I started my song my voice it was strong
But my stomach I fear was not so

Oh solo mio, oh
Oh solo ooh  Help!

When I fell overboard how his majesty roared
And before a siesta he made me his jester
And I found out soon that to be a buffoon
Was a serious thing as a rule
For a jester?s chief employment
Is to kill himself for your enjoyment
And a jester unemployed is nobody?s fool",The Maladjusted Jester,1994

It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean,

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember,
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1997

When all the citizens retire to take their clothes off and perspire
It's one of those rules the greatest fools obey
Because the Sun is far too sultry and one must avoid its ultry-violet 
rays

The natives grieve when the White Men leave their huts
Because they're obviously, definitely, nuts!

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The Japanese don't care to, the Chinese wouldn't dare to
Hindus and Argentines sleep firmly from twelve till one
But Englishmen detest a siesta

In the Philippines they have lovely screens to protect you from the 
glare
In the Malay States there are hats like plates which the Britishers 
won't wear
At twelve noon the natives swoon and no further work is done
But mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun

It's such a surprise for the Eastern eyes to see
That though the English are effete, they're quite impervious to heat
When the White Man rides, every native hides in glee
Because the simple creatures hope he will impale his solar topi on a 
tree

It seems such a shame when the English claim the Earth
That they give rise to such hilarity and mirth

The English garb of the English Sahib merely gets a bit more creased
In Bangkok at twelve o'clock they foam at the mouth and run

That this lady is the greatest dancer he ever knew.

That I haven't got a friend in the crew.
There's not a cruiser on the waves
Without someone who is my devoted slave

Lots of hula hair
A little hula here
A little hula there.
I've got the cutest eyes
Never mind what shade they are.

We got moonlight on the sea
We got mangos and bananas
You can pick right off the tree
We got volleyball and ping-pong
And a lot of dandy games
What ain't we got?
We ain't got dames

We get packages from home
We get movies we get shows
We get speeches from our skipper
And advice from Tokyo Rose 
We get letters doused with perfume
We get dizzy from the smell
What don't we get?
You know darn well

We got nothing to put on a clean white suit for,
What we need is what there ain't no substitute for

There is nothing like a dame, nothing in the world
There is nothing you can name that is anything like a dame

We feel restless we feel blue
We feel lonely and in grief
We feel every kind of feeling
But the feeling of relief
We feel hungry as the wolf felt 
When he met red riding hood
What don't we feel? we don't feel good

Lots of things in life are beautiful but brother,
There is one particular thing that is nothing whatsoever in any shape or form
Like any other

There is nothing like a dame, nothing in the world
There is nothing you can name that is anything like a dame

Nothing else is built the same,
Nothing in the world
Has the soft and wavy frame
Like the silhouette of a dame
 
There's absolutely nothing 
Like the frame of a dame

So suppose a dame ain't bright
Or completely free from flaws
Or as faithful as a bird dog
Or as kind as santa clause
It's a waste of time to worry
Over things that they have not
Be thankful for the things they've got

There is nothing you can name
That is anything like a dame
There are no books like a dame
And nothing looks like a dame
There are no drinks like a dame
And nothing thinks like a dame
Nothing acts like a dame
Or attracts like a dame

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad
You're gonna feel bad
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had

There'll come a time when you'll regret it

Danny Kaye,"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on. 

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps,
His day is marching on.

I have read His fiery gospel writ in rows of burnished steel!
""As ye deal with my contemners, so with you My grace shall deal!
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,""
Since God is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free!
While God is marching on.",Battle Hymn of the Republic,2004

Sleep tight, dream your troubles away 
Goodnight, in spite of any sorrow 
There's a brand new day on it's way tomorrow 
Someday, all your dreams will come true 
Someway, for me and you 
So close your eyes and dream of it my darling 
Till then goodnight, goodnight, sleep tight 

Won't you play the music so the cradle can rock 
To a lullaby in ragtime 
Sleepy hands are creeping to the end of the clock 
Play a lullaby in ragtime 
You can tell the sandman is on his way 
By the way that they play 
As still as the trill of a thrush 
In a twilight hush 
So you can hear 
The rhythm of the river on the side of the boat 
As you sail away to dreamland 
High above the moon you hear a silvery note 
As the sand man takes your hand 
So rock-a-bye my baby 
Don't you cry my baby 
Sleepy time is nigh 
Won't you rock me to a ragtime lullaby 

Now comes the hard part, baby. 
Do you suppose you can sing ""Five Pennies"" while 
Pops and I sing something else? 
Sure, I can sing as good as he can. 
And who can't? 

This little penny is to wish on 
And make your wishes come true 
This little penny is to dream on 
Dream of all you can do 
This little is a dancing penny 
See how it glitters and it glows 
Bright as a whistle 
Light as a thistle 
Quick, quick as a wink 
Up on it's twinkling toes 
This little penny is to laugh on 
To see that tears never fall 
This this little penny 
Is the last little penny 
Most important of all 
For this penny is to love on 
And where love is, heaven is there 
So with just five pennies, if they're these five pennies 
You'll be a millionaire

We got moonlight on the sea
We got mangos and bananas

We ain't got dames

We get packages from home
We get movies we get shows
We get speeches from our skipper
And advice from Tokyo Rose
We get letters doused with perfume
We get dizzy from the smell

We feel hungry as the wolf felt

There is nothing like a dame, nothing in the world
There is nothing you can name that is anything like a dame

Nothing else is built the same,
Nothing in the world
Has the soft and wavy frame
Like the silhouette of a dame
 
There's absolutely nothing 
like the frame of a dame

So suppose a dame ain't bright
Or completely free from flaws
Or as faithful as a bird dog
Or as kind as santa clause
It's a waste of time to worry
Over things that they have not
Be thankful for the things they've got

There is nothing you can name
That is anything like a dame
There are no books like a dame
And nothing looks like a dame
There are no drinks like a dame
And nothing thinks like a dame
Nothing acts like a dame

We've got to do something
Before all we are is a skeleton crew
There's go to be something, someone can do
But all I can think of is you

Little sailor of the skies
Will you be our eyes
Is there land that lies beyond

Fly far beyond the rain
With a prayer upon thy wing
And in this winter of the storm
Seek a harbinger of spring

You're the only one can bring us home
Children of Eden, cry for salvation
Fly far as wings can fly, bring home

Shed no tears for me
There'll be rain enough today
I'm wishing you Godspeed
As I wave you on your way

This won't be the first time I've stayed to face
The bitter consequences of ancient fall from grace
I'm a daughter of the race of Cain
I am not stranger to the rain

And for the boy who's given me the sweetest love I know
I wish for you another love so you won't be alone
Because I am bound to walk among the wounded and the slain
And when the storm comes crashing on the plain
I will dance before the lightning to music sacred and profane

Oh, shed no tears
Light no candle for my sake
This journey I'll making now
Is one we all must take

Shoulder to the wind
I'll turn my face into the spray
And when the heavens open
Let the drops fall where they may

May they finally wash away the stain
Of a daughter of the race of Cain
I am not a stranger to the rain, let it rain

It means other things exist, doesn't it?

It says, ""Adam, leave your list"", doesn't it?
Father, why does my head feel this joy of this dread
Since the moment I said beyond?

I've got a itching on the tips of my fingers
I've got a burning in the back of my brain
I've got a hunger burning inside me, cannot be denied

I've got a feeling that the Father who made us
When he was kindling a pulse in my veins
He left a tiny spark of that fire smoldering inside

The spark of creation is flickering within me
The spark of creation is blazing in my blood
A bit of the fire that lit up the stars and brought life into the mud
The first inspiration, the spark of creation

I see a mountain and I want to climb it
I see a river and I want to be sure
Where there was nothing let there be something
Something made by me

There's things waiting for me to invent them
There's worlds waiting for me to explore
I am an echo of the eternal cry of let there be

The spark of creation, burning bright within me
The spark of creation won't let me rest at all
Until I discover or build or uncover a thing that I can call
My celebration of the spark creation

The spark of creation, may it burn forever
The spark creation, I am a keeper of the flame
We think all we want is a lifetime of leisure
Each perfect day, the same endless vacation

Well that's alright if you're a kind crustacean
But when you're born with an imagination
Sooner of later you're feeling the fire
Getting hotter and higher, the spark of creation

Danny Krivit,"Get away, let's leave today, let's get away! 
So you say you've tried but just can't find the measure
People around you are giving you pressure
Try to resist, all the bad things all around you
If you taste them, they will haunt you
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
I know we can, I know we can, I know we can, I know we can
Ah, get away, let's leave today, let's get away!
What ya, what ya, what ya, what ya know?
Watch all the stars, they lead in the right direction
Not to heed them is a bad reflection
They'll show you the way to what you have been seeking
To ignore them you're only cheating
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
Why don't you get away? Get away
Lay awake at night till the sun comes up in the morning
Never excited; it all seems boring
Make up your mind which way to go about it
Choose your road, just don't doubt it
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
I know we can. I know we can, I know we can, I know we can

He tells the native population that civilization is fine
And three educated savages holler from a bamboo tree
That civilization is a thing for me to see

 So bongo, bongo, bongo, I don't want to leave the Congo, oh no no no no no

 Don't want no bright lights, false teeth, doorbells, landlords, I make it clear
 That no matter how they coax him, I'll stay right here

I looked through a magazine the missionary's wife concealed (Magazine? What happens?)
I see how people who are civilized bung you with automobile (You know you can get hurt that way Daniel?)
At the movies they have got to pay many coconuts to see (What do they see, Darling?)
Uncivilized pictures that the newsreel takes of me

 So bongo, bongo, bongo, he don't want to leave the Congo, oh no no no no no

 So, no matter how they coax him, I'll stay right here

They hurry like savages to get aboard an iron train
And though it's smokey and it's crowded, they're too civilized to complain
When they've got two weeks vacation, they hurry to vacation ground (What do they do, Darling?)
They swim and they fish, but that's what I do all year round

 So bongo, bongo, bongo, I don't want to leave the Congo, oh no no no no no

Seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings

And I always have to say no

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now

Piercing me right through the core

Gotta leave those thoughts behind

And I stop and I park at the top of a cliff in the dark
And I'm digging on the stars in the sea
Shining like a fistful of diamonds

And a couple of 'em fell into the water and they sink the bottom
And I think that I saw some
But I blink and lost 'em
And I drink in the awesome view
Infinite kilometers of water and the tiny ships moving across 'em

Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
Am I too blind to see this is happening to me

I live the fast life, going nowhere fast
I see my past life and politely pass
But I’m already planning on doing it big
For my life after death, I live my life after death (baby)

That’s to properly prepare you for war
So I keep you on your toes
So you could look out for your friends that are really foes

I’m everything that my mama was
Rider, survivor, a motherfuckin' fighter
Thank god for this rapping shit

Thinking that they know me like the Bible, oh hell
But they don’t understand me oh well
Snitching is a sport now so please do tell
The world how I raise hell
Yea, so the clown when I skip jail
I’m just tryina own teams, beat it playa
And dance on the globe like Fred Astaire
The world is ours baby
It’s just waiting for us so don’t be late
And we could both aim for the sky
And shoot for the stars and call it a day
Now you know that I know that we know
If the world wants war cock back and reload

Take me in your arms, I know you're dying to
Fly away forever, fly away forever, fly away forever

Wants to know if she can take me soaring out to sea
Lying in her darkness like a child awaiting birth
Angel comes and takes me for everything I'm worth

Take me in your arms, I know you're dying to

Danny O'Keefe,"Highways and dance halls
A good song takes you far
Your write about the moon
And you dream about the stars
Blues in old motel rooms
Girls in daddy's car
You sing about the nights
And you laugh about the scars
Coffee in the morning cocaine afternoons
You talk about the weather
And you grin about the rooms
Phone calls long distance
To tell how you've been
Forget about the losses, you exaggerate the wins

And when you stop to let em know
You've got it down
Its just another town along the road

The ladies come to see you
If your name still rings a bell
They give you damn near nothin
And they'll say they knew you well
So you tell em you'll remember
But they know its just a game
And along the way their faces
All begin to look the same
And when you stop to let em know
You got it down
Its just another town along the road

Well it isn't for the money
And its only for a while
You stalk about the rooms
And you roll away the miles
Gamblers in the neon, clinging to guitars

But you're wrong about the stars
And when you stop to let em know
You got it down
Its just another town along the way",The Road [*],1973

Where love barely fits

And though we once had something
No words could tear apart
Now you be your's and I'll be mine

Where love barely fits

Oh tell them that we just don't care
Tell them dreams of flowers
But our garden's bare

Danny O'Keefe,"Magdalena sits in her chair
Speaking on the mass
She talks in splice and splinters
She laughs not breaking glass

She says that she would have me
Spirit her away
Stealing all my images
Till there's nothin' left to say

Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are
Your love is like a razor
My heart is just a scar

Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are

She tells me that she wants me
Then she tells me not to bother
She tells me that I couldn't hold
A candle to her father

She knows that she's got me
When I start to rave about
She'll just smile and flash her eyes
And blow the candle out

Oh, Magdalena
Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are

Magdalena lying there
Could make a dancer stumble
Make a preacher bite his tongue
And leave him with a mumble

And if you think I'm crazy, babe
Or that I'm kiddin' you
Just pay your dues and lose your blues
When she gets her tongue in you

Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are
Your love is like a razor
My heart is just a scar

Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are

Well, I can't be forgotten and I can't be ignored
You find me with my poems and my songs
But if upon your journey, you're returning to L.A.
Won't you take this little red-haired girl along?

A palace in Dallas a club in New Orleans
Diamonds on my fingers silk imported clothes
And I can tell a fast train by the way she blows

Just let me feel that leather when I ride
Don't give me no paint and powder woman
This boy likes to feel the hide

False eyelashes and a false foundation
May build your pride
But don't give me no plastic saddle gal
Let me feel that leather when I ride

I'm the cream of societies I'm a man about town
Never looked long for nothin' that I ain't found
I ain't always right but I ain't never wrong

June from our home we started 
Left old Eireann's Isle, to Poland we departed 
Hope within our hearts
We can win a trophy

C'mon you boys in green, Ireland's bouncing back again
We have got our Trap, the cat is in the sack
We'll not forget you Jack on the Rocky Road to Poland 
One, two, three, four, five 
Irish eyes are smiling 
Let your voices ring

You'll never beat the Irish

Make your mother proud, inflate your plastic hammer
Bate your bodhrán loud and learn your Polish grammar 
Credit union loan, sold the Opel Corsa
Hired a camper van, picked it up in Warsaw,
Been so close before, hopes slammed in the door
Now we're back for more, we can win the battle
C'mon you boys in green, never have we seen
Such a fearless team on the Rocky Road to Poland

Every mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood six-foot-six and weighed two-forty-five
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew ya didn't give no lip to big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all, you just said hi to Big John

Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the promised land, big John
(Big John, big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man-made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant oak tree he just stood there alone, big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out ""there's a light up above!""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave

And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine

They just placed a marble stand in front of it

I saw an old farmer in the field that he just hold
His face was all brown and wrinkled by the sun and the wind
And he was talking to the Lord just like he'd be talking to a friend

Well he said with his voice calm and quiet
Them corn tassels need sucking I got no strength to tie it
Had no rain in so long that the fields are mighty dusty
And it's been so unbearable hot that the kids were even gettin' fussy

Now that grass down and the pasture it should be knee high
If we could just have a little shower Lord it might keep the calf from going dry
Oh but listen to me talking you'd think I wasn't grateful
Why if you didn't know me so well Lord you'd think I was down right hateful

You'd think I forgot about that new calf that you sent
And the money in the mail that took care of the rent
Mama's cough's better and Johnny's home from the navy
And that good Sunday dinner of hot chicken and dumplings and gravy

And that new preacher you sent us Lord he's sure a fine young man
Why he's just convertin' them sinners to beat the man
Well I guess I'll mosey on home now Lord I won't take no more your time

Danny Parks,"(God put a song in the heart of an angel and softly she sang it to me)
I get to thinkin' lotta times about when I was a lad 
Of the old home place where I grew up of the days both good and bad 
My overalls were hand-me-downs shoes full of holes 
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry 
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
And yet and somehow our homefire never flickered once
Cause when all the things went wrong
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
(What a friend we have in Jesus)
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
Morning come Rock of Ages it gently wake me once again
Then daddy'd reach up and take the Bible down and he'd read it
Read it loud and strong
And I always felt that maybe our home was blessed
When daddy'd say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess then Bob and Tommy and Dan
By then dad's hair was turning grey and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that when dad grew weak mom's faith grew strong
And I think those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
(Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee)
I guess the old house is still standin' I don't go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls no steps to grace the floor
For you see mama sings in heaven now round God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this old world is a whole lot better place
Because one time my mama sang a song (precious mem'ries flood my soul)",Mama Sang a Song,1999

And if I got hurt he'd go for help or he'd back me up in a fight
He growed all the while I was trainin' forget him I never will
'Cause you'd never see me with right at my heels was Oklahoma Bill
We hit a long ridge one sunup and it seemed like death held all the cards

'Cause we payed and payed with lives of men for every hard fought yard
When finally we drove up to the top there wasn't nothin' but death behind
And as we all dug in we all thanked God though we numbered only nine
And as the snipers switched their guns as darkness closed that hill

My soul companion in the night was Oklahoma Bill
There's no glory in a battle once you've seen its awful cost
But there's glory in the knowledge that your flag is never lost
And yet in the stillness of the nightime and all alone you hold a post

You start cryin' like a baby sittin' there with all the ghosts
You feel your buddies are pattin' your back though their guns're silent and still
It's only a dog tryin' to love you my Oklahoma Bill
I gave my note to the Colonel and I bound a shattered leg

And I said Bill we're sure in trouble he never whimpered or begged
I could tell he hated to leave me I was the only God he ever knew
But quick as a flash he took of through the night like a fightin' marine would do
I kept firin' till help finally came it was him though that saved that hill

A dyin' dog had got through the lines my Oklahoma Bill
That little ol' kid will always wonder what happened to her dog
But she'll find out on Judgement Day when she sees the big Skipper's log
We'll all walk in and bugles'll blow and we'll stand our last revue

And men who've died for men on earth will get their heavenly dues
And if all brave hearts are there that day I'll get my greatest thrill
When I hang this medal around the neck of Oklahoma Bill",Oklahoma Bill,1999
Danny Parks,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

Danny Parks,"Well it was battered and scared,
And the auctioneer felt it was hardly worth his while,
To waste much time on the old violin but he held it up with a smile,
Well it sure ain't much but its all we got left I guess we aught to sell it to,
Oh, now who'll start the bid on this old violin?
Just one more and we'll be through.

And then he cried one give me one dollar,
Who'll make it two only two dollars who'll make it three,
Three dollars twice now that's a good price,
Now who's gonna bid for me?
Raise up your hand now don't wait any longer the auctions about to end,
Who's got four Just one dollar more to bid on this old violin?

Well the air was hot and the people stood around as the sun was setting low,
From the back of the crowd a gray haired man,
Came forward and picked up the bow,
He wiped the dust from the old violin then he tightened up the strings,
Then he played out a melody pure and sweet, sweeter than the Angels sing, 
And then the music stopped and the auctioneer, 
With a voice that was quiet and low he said now what am I bid,
For this old violin and he held it up with a bow.

And then he cried out one give me one thousand,
Who'll make it two only two thousand who'll make it three,
Three thousand twice you know that's a good price,
Common who's gonna to bid for me?
And the people cried out what made the change we don't understand,
Then the auctioneer stopped and he said with a smile,
It was the touch of the Master's hand.

You know threes many a man with his life out of tune,
Battered and scared with sin and he's auctioned cheap,
To a thankless world much like that old violin,
Oh, but then the Master comes,
And that old foolish crowd they never understand,
The worth of a soul and the change that is rought,
Just by one touch of the Masters hand.

And then he cried out one give me one thousand,
Who'll make it two only two thousand who'll make it three,
Three thousand twice you know that's a good price,
Common who's gonna bid for me?
And the people cried out what made the change we don't understand,
Then the auctioneer stopped and he said with a smile,
It was the touch, that's all it was; it was the touch of the Master's hand,
It was the touch of the Master's hand; oh, it was the touch of the Master's hand.

Danny Parks,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Danny Polo,"It all comes back to me now, 
A starry summer sky,
A laughing you and I, alone.
It all comes back to me now, 
A sea of midnight blue,
Your face uplifted to my own.

We called it a thrill of the moment, 
And blamed the moon up above,
We didn't know what the glow meant,
We never dreamed it might be love.
It all comes back to me now, 
The love I threw away,
And now each lonely night I pray, 
That it will all come back to me someday.",It All Comes Back to Me Now,1996
Danny Polo,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.
Let's never have to share another early autumn.",Early Autumn,1999
Danny Polo,"I may be wrong but I think you're wonderful
I may be wrong but I think you're swell
I like your style say, I think it's marvelous
I'm always wrong so how can I tell

Deuces to me are all aces
Life is to me just a bore
Faces are all open spaces
You might be John Barrymore
You came along say I think you're wonderful
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

I may be wrong but I think you're wonderful
I may be wrong but I think you're swell
I like your style say, I really think it's marvelous
I'm always wrong so how can I tell

Deuces to me are all aces
Life is to me just a bore
Faces are all open spaces
You might be John Barrymore
You came along say I think you're wonderful
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

You said that Edison would never make that light
You laughed at Mr. Franklin with his key and kite
The point of the song is I'm always wrong
But with you baby I'm oh so right.",I May Be Wrong,1999
Danny Polo,"Honey dear, want you near,
Just turn out the lights and then come over here!
Nestle close, up to my side,
My heart's afire, with love's desire
In my arms, rest complete,
Never thought that life could ever be so sweet

Danny Polo,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1999
