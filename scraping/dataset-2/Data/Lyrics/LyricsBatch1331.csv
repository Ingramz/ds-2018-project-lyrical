Bob Wilber,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2000
Bob Wilber,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die, 
We'll keep it that way
Up among the stars 
We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon dear
East of the sun and west of the moon",East of the Sun,2000
Bob Wilber,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going on?",How Long Has This Been Going On?,2000
Bob Wilber,"I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt claps of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still",My Heart Stood Still,2000
Bob Wilber,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Bob Wilber,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,2000
Bob Wilber,"Waking skies at sunrise
Every sunset too
Seems to be bringing me
Memories of you

Here and there, everywhere
Scenes that we once knew
And they all just recall
Memories of you

How I wish, I could forget those
Those happy yesteryears
That have left a rosary of tears

Your face beams in my dreams
'Spite of all I do
Everything seems to bring
Memories of you

And your face beams in my dreams
'Spite of all I do
Everything seems to bring
Memories, just memories of you",Memories of You,2002
Bob Wilber,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue

Bob Wilber,"Please forgive this platitude
But I like your attitude
You are just the kind I've had in mind
Never could find

Honey, I'm so keen on you
I could come to lean on you
On a random bay, give you your way
Do what you say

Gee, it's all fine and dandy
Sugar candy, when I've got you

Then I only see the sunny side
Even trouble has it's funny side
When you're gone, my sugar candy
I get so lonesome, I get blue

But when you're handy
It's fine and dandy
But when you're gone
What can I do?",Fine and Dandy,2002
Bob Wilber,"Moonlight and magnolia, starlight in your hair
All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

Bob Wilber,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

I want to be your lover man
All by myself

I don't need no one to love you
I'm gonna love you all by myself

You'll find, little girl, you know it too,
Don't you know I'm in love with you
All by myself
All by myself.

I don't want no one to love you
I want to love you all by myself

Meet me in the parlor 'bout half past one,
We'll go on down and have some fun
All by ourselves,
All by ourselves,
We don't need nobody with us
We gonna do it all by ourselves.

Bob Wilber,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town

Where skies of blue are calling me
Where balmy air and golden moonlight

Your mountains green, and deep blue sea
Your fragrant flowers and dreamy music
Unite and sing a aloha-hi to me

Bob Wilber,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

Love does not stand sharing

Bob Wilber,"I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,

The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.

I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;

The whole world smiles with you,

Bob Wilber,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone

But on the night you left me the moon raced back to the sky

But just like the moon they fade from sight
In the blue heavens I see your face smiling at me
My heart will never be free until we're back together

Bob Wilder Sextet,"There's a story told of a little Japanese
Sitting demurely 'neath the cherry blossom trees
Miss Butterfly's her name
A sweet little innocent child was she
Till a fine young American from the sea
To her garden came
They met beneath the cherry blossoms every day
And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with a soul 'twas easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

Poor Butterfly 'neath the blossoms waiting
Poor Butterfly, for she loved him so
The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears
She murmurs low
The moon and I
Know that he'll be faithful
I'm sure he'll come to me by and by
But if he won't come back
Then I'll never sigh or cry
I just must die

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Bob Willoughby,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,1999
Bob Willoughby,"Our little dream castle with every dream gone,
Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,
The end of the story is told on the door.

Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.

Evening shadows find,
There 'neath the stars a maiden so fair divine.

Broken by fate that holds them so far apart.

In her arms he belongs, then her pray'r is a song,

Gave me Dinah;

Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

So maybe you'll find I'm the kind of guy to brag
But listen to me and see, if you don't agree
No melody rolls like that old steel guitar rag

And when they slide that thing along the strings
It sounds so doggone heavenly, you hear an angel sing
An' when you start your feet, your heart will beat
The rhythm to that old steel guitar rag

You may be kind choosy 'bout the kind of songs you hear
You may like songs that's bluesy, so you cry right in your beer
But if you like a tune that's bound to drive away your care
Make happy your soul with that old steel guitar rag",Steel Guitar Rag,1998

Tired of transportation in the back of a hack

Woo woo, woo woo ch' boogie

And read the situation from the front to the back

So put it right back in the rack, jack

Kiss the playful prairie breeze

If there is and you know her, 
Show her!

With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in

Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me!

Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

She lives a way down on Shinbone Alley
The number on the gate, the number on the door

Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you don't stay a little longer

When slop bucket fell from the window up above

If she don't like biscuits, feed her cornbread

They jump on a man like a dog on a bone

Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys,"Tonight in a bar alone I'm sitting
Apart from the laughter and the cheers
While scenes from the past rise before me
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer

A vision of someone who loved me
Brings a lone silent tear to my eye
Oh, I know that my life's been a failure
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer

I'm seeing the road that I've traveled
A road paved with heartaches and tears
And I'm seeing the past that I've wasted
While watchin' the bubbles in my beer

As I think of the heart that I've broken
And all the golden chances that have passed me by
And the dreams that I've made, now are empty
As empty as the bubbles in my beer

What makes a fellow start thinkin' of fallin' in love?

Why does a gander meander in search of a goose?
What puts the kick in a chicken, the magic in June?

The candy maker, the baker, the man on the street
The city charmer, the farmer, the man in the moon

Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

And now I sit and wonder night and day

Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys,"You ought to see my blue eyed Sally
She lives a way down on Shinbone Alley
The number on the gate, the number on the door
And the next house over is the grocery store

Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you don't stay a little longer

Can't go home if you're going by the mill
'Cause the bridge washed out at the bottom of the hill
Big creek's up, and the big creek's level
Plow my corn with a double shovel

Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you don't stay a little longer

Sitting in the window, singing to my love
When slop bucket fell from the window up above
Mule and the grasshopper eating ice cream
Mule got sick and they laid him on the green

Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you don't stay a little longer

Grab your gal and pat her on the head
If she don't like biscuits, feed her cornbread
The gals around big creek, about half grown
They jump on a man like a dog on a bone

Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you don't stay a little longer

Bob Wilson & His Varsity Rhythm Boys,"Little Lilly was oh! So silly and shy
And all the fellows knew,
She wouldn't bill and coo:
Ev'ry single night some smart fellow would try 
o cuddle up to her, but she would cry:
 
""Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
I'm beside him, Mercy!
Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ev'ry minute he gets bolder,
Now he's leaning on my shoulder,
Ma, he's kissing me!""
 
Lilly was so good, ev'ry body could tell.
You'd never see her roam,
She'd always stay at home;
All the neighbors knew little Lilly too well.
For when the boys would call, They'd hear her yell:
 
Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
If you peek in, Can't you see I'm goin' to weaken?
Ma, he wants to marry me,

I shall holler for assistance,

Bob Wootton,"An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie yi ooh
Yippie yi yay
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd, across these endless skies

I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said

He said they let me out of prison down in Frisco
For ten long years I've paid for what I've done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana
To see my Rose and get to know my son

Give my love to Rose please won't you, Mister
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

Won't you tell them I said thanks for waiting for me
Tell my boy to help his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another
'Cause it ain't right that she should live alone

Mister here's a bag with all my money
It won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

Said, ""Where did all of the old songs go
Kids sure play funny music these days
They play it in the strangest ways""
Said, ""it looks to me like they've all gone wild
It was peaceful back when I was a child""
Well, man, could it be that the girls and boys
Are trying to be heard above your noise?
And the lonely voice of youth cries ""What is truth?""

Looks up and says, ""Daddy, what is war?""
""son, that's when people fight and die""

Being taught the golden rule
And by the time another year has gone around
It may be his turn to lay his life down
Can you blame the voice of youth for asking 
""What is truth?""

A young man sittin' on the witness stand
The man with the book says ""Raise your hand""
""Repeat after me, I solemnly swear""
The man looked down at his long hair
And although the young man solemnly swore
Nobody seems to hear anymore
And it didn't really matter if the truth was there
It was the cut of his clothes and the length of his hair
And the lonely voice of youth cries 
""What is truth?""

Has found new ways to move her feet
The young man speaking in the city square
Is trying to tell somebody that he cares
Yeah, the ones that you're calling wild
Are going to be the leaders in a little while

You must have felt me shiver,
Shaken by a wave of fright,
That you calm with a whisper.
And fear gave way to better things,
Like a warm summer and sweeter dreams.  

Like a warm spring rain, on a roof above;
The way you call my name, when we make love.
While the world outside my window goes insane,
You're here to remind me, a few good things remain. 

When living leaves my pride bruised up,
I'm fragile as a feather.
The storms of life just won't let up,
You're like a change of weather.
When dust settles on my dreams,
You wash them clean.

The way you call my name, when we make love.
While the world outside my window goes insane,

It's the big dark behind you, you can run, 
But it always finds you

You never want to look back, manifest in bad dreams

I'm alive, cause I'm taking all my medicine 
I'm on top of the world and nothing brings me down 

What's that junk you been shooting in your veins 
Young kids do X headed straight for little brains 
Pop a bean for me, call it a shame, 
Everyone escape, try to get away 
Shot from the head, you're the walking dead, 
Corpses chasing artificial happiness 
Death to the freaks and the fiends that deserved it

To strike from the darkness, when you are most lax

I wonder if we'll ever meet
My song of love is incomplete
I'm just the words looking for the tune
Reaching for the moon and you",Reaching for the Moon,1993
Bobbi Baird,"One little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret
One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
One little heartache left as a token
One little plaything carelessly broken
Remember the night
The night you said, ""I love you""
Remember?
Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?
Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot
You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember
[2]
Into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day
You loved me too, my dreams had come true, and all the world was
May
But soon the Maytime turned to December
You had forgotten, do you remember?",Remember,1993
Bobbi Baird,"Where the dreamy volga flows
There's a lonely Russian rose
Gazing tenderly
Down upon her knee
Where a baby's brown eyes glisten
Listen

Every night you'll hear her croon
A Russian lullaby

Just a little plaintive tune
When baby starts to cry

Rock-a-bye my baby
Somewhere there may be

A land that's free for you and me
And a Russian lullaby",Russian Lullaby,1993
Bobbi Baird,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content
The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on
The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""
There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon
The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended,1993
Bobbi Baird,"After all these years I can't forget 
The happiness that I once knew
Maybe there's a spark that's burning yet 
And filling me with thoughts of you
Gone is the treasure we found and let go
Was it worth keeping? We never will know
There might have been a sky of blue for me and you
We'll never know
There might have been a garden, too, where roses grew
We'll never know
We might have built a castle high
For you were young and so was I
But we just kissed and said ""Goodbye""
And so 
We'll never know

Maybe we had found the thing we sought
And maybe it was worth the cost
Leaving it behind without a thought
What happiness we might have lost
Maybe the rose that we covered with snow
Wanted to blossom, we never will know",We'll Never Know,1993
Bobbi Baird,"Gone is the romance that was so divine.
'tis broken and cannot be mended.
You must go your way,
And I must go mine.
But now that our love dreams have ended...

What'll I do
When you are far away
And I am blue
What'll I do?

What'll I do?
When I am wond'ring who
Is kissing you
What'll I do?

What'll I do with just a photograph
To tell my troubles to?

When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
That won't come true

I lost the beautiful rainbow

Today, Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And papa said to mama, as he passed around the blackeyed peas
Well, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please
There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow
And mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And mama said to me, child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all morning, and you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge

A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
And brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round; papa caught it, and he died last spring
And now mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billie Joe,1990
Bobbie Gentry,"At first Mom and Poppa called the little girl a lady
They raised her on the banks of a river bed

Already Moma's cookin' Poppa somethin' to eat
At half past Poppa he's a ready to go, he jumps in

My little baby brother on the floor that's Mac,
Rhett and Lynn are the family twins,
Big brother Eddie's on the bayou fishin'

That's how me and Poppa get in to town
It takes every bit of a night and day to even reach
A place where the people stay

Oh I can hardly wait until tomorrow comes around
That's the day my Poppa takes the furs to town
Poppa done promised me that I could go
He'd even let me see a cowboy show

I saw the cowboys and Indians for the first time then

Bobbie Gentry,"""Well, I remember it all very well lookin' back
It was the summer that I turned eighteen.
We lived in a one-room, run down shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans.

We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we was hard-pressed
When Momma spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress.

Well, Momma washed and combed and curled my hair,
Then she painted my eyes and lips.
Then I stepped into the satin dancin' dress.
It had a split in the side clean up to my hips.

It was red, velvet-trimmed, and it fit me good
And standin' back from the lookin' glass
Was a woman
Where a half grown kid had stood.

She said, ""Here's your last chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Here's your last chance, Fancy, don't let me down.""

Momma dabbed a little bit of perfume
On my neck and she kissed my cheek
Then I saw the tears welling up
In her troubled eyes as she started to speak

She looked at our pitiful shack and then
She looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, Your Pa's runned off, and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death.

She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high-healed shoe

It sounded like somebody else was talkin'
Askin', ""Momma what do I do?""
She said, ""Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy.
They'll be nice to you.""

She said, ""Here's your last chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Here's your last chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
God forgive me for what I do,
But if you want out girl it's up to you
Now don't let me down,
Now get on out, you better start sleepin' uptown.""

That was the last time I saw my momma
When I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby.
Momma died and I ain't been back.

But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no other way out.
It wasn't very long after that I knew exactly
What my momma was talkin' 'bout.

I knew what I had to do.
Then I made myself this solemn vow:
I's gonna to be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how.

But I couldn't see spendin' the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame.
You know I mighta been born just plain white trash.
But Fancy was my name.

""Here's your last chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.

Wasn't long after that a benevolent man
Took me in off the streets
One week later I was pourin' his tea
In a five roomed penthouse suite.

Charmed a king, a congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
And I got me an elegant Georgia mansion
And a New York townhouse flat.

Now I ain't done bad

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous
Hypocrites who call me bad.
They criticize Momma for turning me out
No matter how little we had.

Though haven't had to worry 'bout nothin'
Now for nigh on fifteen years
But I can still hear the desperation
In my poor mommas voice ringin' in my ears.

""Here's your last chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Oh, here's your last chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
God forgive me for what I do,
But if you want out well it's up to you.
Now your mama's helping you move uptown.""",Fancy,1991

Feet propped up on the railin'
Sittin' in front of the country store
Discussin' how the crops were failin'

About that time a car drove by
With an Ace Insurance bumper sticker
Well that must be the man been courtin' Abell
He's somethin' of a city slicker
(Ah, you can tell just from the way he's drivin' that car)

Do you reckon he's goin' up to see Abell
You know her daddy went to Maben this day
And her mommas been in Arkansas with her ailin' pa
Ain't nobody home that way

Better call up the sheriff in Calhoun city
And have the preacher organize a 'vestigating committee
To see what's going on

With Bentley out taking the lead
Followed by a tractor and a half lame mule

And off in the distance was Abell's house
And there wasn't a soul in sight

And screeched to a grinding halt

And hit pa's first-prize hog in the head
And left half a dozen mama's chickens for dead
But it wasn't nobody's fault

Oh, look at Harvey's prize hog
And all of them darlin' old grown bad trusty chickens
(We got more important things to tend to, boy)
I wonder if they're covered?

Committee bounded on the front porch
To meet the enemy face to face
But Abell yelled at 'em through the screen door
""y'all messed up my daddy's place""

But in her hand she waved a policy
Sayin' with a Mona Lisa grin
""Well, y'all timed that one just about right
'Cause Ace done struck again""

On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'

In the ghetto
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto

The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me,
Are we too blind to see,
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way

Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto

And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car,
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand

he'd come tell me everything is alright,
he'd kiss and tell me everything is alright,

Telling me that he's all mine,
Learning from each others knowing,
Looking to see how much we'd grown.

Got mad and closed the door.

You made me so very happy,

That they're about to play my record
On the radio

Feeling like I'm bringing pen to mind
But the words will come to me in their own time
Tumbling and stumbling over in rhyme

And the ugliest word that I ever heard

It's an easy out for all you should have been
And if there's one thing
That I just can't bring myself to compromise

Just marmalade and music stands

Bobbie Gentry,"I had a most distressing dream last night
I dreamed I was a crystal bird
Caught in perpetual flight

I'd ascend and glide and descend and ride
On the wind and never alight
I had a most distressing dream last night

Glass enclosed, exposed wherever I flew
With no control and a crystal soul
That one could see right through

No ethereal nest where I could rest
I was frightened by what I knew
That my two crystal legs were broken in two

When I awoke my heart was beating fast
As if all night and endless flight
An eternity had passed

As I shook my head and slipped from my bed
Released from the prism, at last
I stepped upon a bit of shattered glass",Refractions,2002

Bobbie Gentry,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and we walked back to the house to eat
And mama hollered at the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said she got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
Today Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

Papa said to mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
Mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece of apple pie, you know it just don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

And we'll play checkers a-all day

Sunday morning
Sun shining from your eyes
Sleepy face 
Smiling into mine

Sunday morning
Lots of time with nothing to do
Lots of time to spend with you
On Sunday morning

It's so quiet in the street
We can hear the sound of feet walking by
I'll put coffee on to brew
We can have a cup or two
And do what other people do
On Sunday morning

Sunday morning, Sunday morning, Sunday, Sunday
I love Sunday, Sunday morning

Come hold me in your arms
I love you
Everything's alright
Sunday morning
Everything's alright

And talking to your good neighbor
'Cause he ain't interested in favors
No, in the road that he's gotta hold

'Cause life's been canning his hopes and wishes
But still he's got ambition, yeah
In the life that he wants to own

And sit back in the row

Bobbie Gentry,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton, and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And mama hollered out the back door, y'all, remember to wipe your feet
And then she said, ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
Today, Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And papa said to mama, as he passed around the blackeyed peas
Well, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please
There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow
And mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And mama said to me, child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all morning, and you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge

A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
And brother married Becky Thompson they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round papa caught it, and he died last spring
And now mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billie Joe [#],2018

And his heart was heavy as night

An' watched as he passed her way

Had ridden when she was his wife

Don't fight him, don't spite him

The yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset
The stranger went free, of course
For you can't hang a man for killin' a woman
Who's tryin' to steal your horse
This is the tale of the red headed stranger
And if he should pass your way
Stay out of the path of the ragin' black stallion
And don't lay a hand on the bay

Don't cross him, don't boss him

Yeah 어느새 성숙해진 우리 마음과
애인 아닌 가족 같은 너와 나의 사이

이젠 우린 답이 짧아진 사이 느껴지는 마음의 무게의 차이

아무도 아니라며 아무렇지 않게 비밀이 하나 더 쌓여

걱정이 의심 같고 설마가 진짜가 돼서 서로 집착해
오해를 풀어줄 힘도 없어 그냥 미안하다 대답만 해
눈치채기 전에 천천히 멀어진 너와 나의 거리 땜에

Impossible though things may get improbable I will forget

Bobby Bare,"They passed an ordinance in the town they said we'd have to tear it down
That little old shack out back so dear to me
Though the health department said its day was over and dead
It will stand forever in my memory
Don't let them tear that little brown building down
Don't let them tear that precious building down
Don't let them tear that dear old building down
There's not another like it in the country or the town

It was not so long ago that I went tripping through the snow
Out to that house behind my old hound dog
Where I would sit me down to rest like a snowbird on his nest
And I'd read that Sears and Roebuck catalog
Oh I would hum a happy tune peeping through the quarter moon
As my daddy's kin had done so much before
It was in that quiet spot daily cares could be forgot
And it gave the same relief to rich and poor
Don't let them tear...

Now it was not a castle fair but I could dream of future there
Build my castle to the yellow jackets drone
I could orbit round the sun fight with General Washington
Or be a king upon a golden throne
It wasn't fancy built at all we had newspapers on the wall
It was air-conditioned in the wintertime
Oh it was just an humble hut but its door was never shut
And a man could get inside without a dime
Don't let them tear...

A little bit south of the Okechobee there's a story that the swamp folks tell
About a mean old man named Jesse Langtree
And a sweet young maid and a bottomless well
That water's cold but that don't matter how deep it is no one can tell
Just drop a stone you'll never hear it splatter
It just falls down down forever in the bottomless well
Through fifteen miles of snakes and gators
With the raging fever and the trembling chills
I wandered lost through the Okechobee
And there I seen 'em sittin' there by the bottomless well
Yeah now there he sits...
(Oh let's hear it for Jesse now hey Jesse)

I asked her for a drink of water and as Jesse slept me and her we talked a spell
She said that she was his wife and daughter Lord Lord
But his heart was cold cold and dark as the bottomless well
And as he slept I bent to kiss her I heard a loud and jealous yell
Felt my head explode in darkness two big hairy arms picked me up
And dragged me to the bottomless well
I woke up in fear and trembling I was staring down into the jaws of hell
As he held me high above his shoulders
A gonna throw me down down down to the bottomless well
Now here I sit in Jesse's big white wicker rocker
Eatin' his candy coated cashews sippin' his orange lemonade
While that sweet young thing fans the flies from off my eyebrows

Listening for the sound of guns listening for the rolling drums
And the man who never comes to the Hills of Shiloh
Have you heard Amanda sing in the Hills of Shiloh
Whispering to her wedding ring in the Hills of Shiloh
Hear her humming soft and low poor Amanda doesn't know
Twas ended forty years ago in the Hills of Shiloh




",In the Hills of Shiloh,1973
Bobby Bare,"Well he rode through the woods on a big blue ox
He had fists as hard as choppin' blocks
Five hundred pounds and nine feet tall that's Paul
Talk about working when he swung his ax you could hear it ring for a mile and half
He'd yell timber and down she'd fall for Paul
Talk about drinkin' that man's so mean that he'd never drink nothin' but kerosene
A five gallon can is a little bit small for Paul
Talk about women that man's so lusty
Needs a woman ever hour just to keep from gettin' rusty
Young ones run and the old ones crawl to Paul
Talk about tough well he once had a fight with a thunderstorm on a cold dark night
I ain't sayin' who won but it don't storm at all round here thanks to Paul
He was ninety years old when he said with a sigh
Said I think I'm gonna lay right down and die
Cause sunshine and sorrow I've seen it all says Paul
Says there ain't no man alive can kill me ain't no woman left can thrill me
And I think a heaven just might be a ball says Paul
So he died and we cried
It took eighteen men just to bust that ground
Took three or four more just to lower him down
Then we covered him up and we figured that was all for Paul
But late one night the trees started shaking
And the dogs started barking and the earth started quaking
And out of the ground with the hi ye all came Paul
Well he shook the dirt from off his clothes
He scratched his ass and wiped his nose
You know being dead wasn't no fun at all says Paul
He said now up in heaven they got harps on their knees
They got clouds and wings but they got no trees
I don't think that's much of a heaven at all says Paul
So he jumps on his ox with a fare thee well
He said I'll find out if they got trees in hell
And he rode away and that was all we ever seen of Paul
Butthe next time you hear a timber yell
That sounds like it's comin' from the pits of hell
Then a boomin' laugh and a ghostly wail like somebody choppin' on the devil's tail
Then a shout and a call a crash and a fall
That ain't no mortal man at all that's just Paul




",Paul,1973
Bobby Bare,"Does anyone know of a girl who might like a tired old boy on a rusty old bike
Who just pulled in today from the Florida Glades
And just got to stop and rest awhile and rest awhile
Does anyone know of someone who can use
A hard working fool who don't ever touch booze
Who's only vice is a roll of a dice
And he's just got to stop and rest awhile and rest awhile
Easy there lady I don't want no trouble I'll pay for my chili and leave
Easy there mister I got the money and if I was you I'd let go of my sleeve
Does anyone know of a place I can sleep
Where I won't hear the cry of the wind as she weeps
For a poor wandering soul who got no place to go
And just got to stop and rest awhile and rest awhile
No fellers you can't have a ride cause my bike and my girls I don't share
Hey sheriff thank you for stoppin' and being concerned bout the length of my hair
Can anyone lend me a half tank of gas
And I guess that a smile would be too much to ask
Cause your warm friendly town don't want my kind around
And I guess I can't stop and rest awhile and rest awhile
Hello mama your boys comin' home cause my bike and my dreams all got wrecked
No mama don't hung up the phone I'm sorry that I had to call you collect
Can anyone lend me a half tank...

Bobby Bare,"It's two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe
The onions are frying the neon is bright and the jukebox is startin' to play
And the sign on the wall says In God We Trust all others have to pay
And it's two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe
The short order cook with the momma tattoo he's a turnin' them hamburgers slow
Eggs over easy whole wheat down, y'all want that coffee to go
He never once dreamed as a rodeo star that he'd wind up here today
At two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe
There's a tall skinny girl in the booth in the back wearin' jeans and a second hand fur
She's been to the doctor then called up a man
And now wonders just which way could turn
She stares at her coffee then looks toward the ceiling
But Lord it's a strange place to pray
At two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe
There's a guy in a tux and he stands in the corner feedin' the jukebox his dimes
He just had a woman and thought that he'd bought
But found he'd just rented some time
And he couldn't sleep so he came back to see if anyone else wants to play
At two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe
Now there's an old dollar bill in the frame on the wall
The first one that Rose ever made
It was once worth a dollar a long time ago but like Rose it's beginnin' to fade
She's back of the register dreamin' of someone and how things would be if he'd stay
But it's two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe
The stoop shouldered man and his frizzy haired woman
It's strange how their eyes never meet
He's playin' the pinball she's fixin' the blanket of the baby asleep on the seat
He's out of work she's puttin' on weight and they never did have too much to say
It's two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe
The waitress Darlene she sits at the counter paintin' her fingernails blue
And the short order cook he yells move it or lose it and pick up an order of stew
But someday a rich handsome man'll walk in and carry her far far away
From two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe
The shaggy haired hippie he's finished his meal
And he's countin' the change in his jeans
Burger and coffee are 85 cents and he's only got 23
He smiles at Rose and she winks back at him but Lord that's a high price to pay
At two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe
The baby faced sailor he leans on the phone and dials the number again
While the guy in the tux tells the girl in the jeans bout wonderful places he's been
And a wino comes in off the street and starts shoutin'
Bout fortunes that he threw away
And Rosalie's asking the shaggy haired hippie if he's got a warm place to stay
And the short order cook takes a five from the till while Rosie's looking away
And the onions keep frying the neon is bright and the jukebox continues to play
And it's two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe

Bobby Bare,"Well friends you know once I was took in by a girl with a twinkly eye
But the first time that I wasn't lookin' she ran off with a handsomer guy oh my
But I'm an inventin' type feller so as soon as my brain got uncurled
I tiptoed right down to my cellar and built a mechanical girl
Oh her arms are iron her legs are steel her hips are on wires attached to a wheel
And her spine is a coil that I now and then oil she's my ever lovin' machine

She's always right there when I need her and she's very easy to please
And hardly cost nothing to feed her just some water and oil and grease
She never complains when I stay out all night she never complains that I ain't rich
And each time I want her just to cuddle me up tight
I just reach out and turn on 'er switch
Oh her arms are iron...

She has no trouble makin' her mind up cause friends I did not give her a mind
And her heart is a clock that I wind up so I know that she'll love me in time
She always did what she was supposed to right up to this evening but then
She had an affair with a toaster and they ran off and left me again
Oh her arms were iron her legs were steel her hips were on wires attached to a wheel
And her spine was a coil that I used to oil she was my ever lovin' machine

Bobby Bare,"This mornin' I jumped on my horse and went out for a ride
Some wild outlaws chased me and they shot me in the side
So I crawled into a wild cat's cave to find a place to hide
But some pirates found me a sleepin' there and soon they had me tied
Till a lady zombie cut me loose and begged to be my bride
So I said I'd come back Wednesday but I must admit I lied
Cause I run away into the swamp but I forgot my guide
And I stepped into some quicksand and no matter how I tried
I couldn't get out until I met a crocodile named Clyde
Who took me to some cannibals who planned to have me fried
They built a fire under me and I swear I almost cried
Till an eagle come and swooped me up and through the air we flied
But he dropped me in a boilin' lake a thousand miles wide
And you know what happened then I died

There's a factory in Columbus hirin' now I understand
And they're looking for an able bodied man
Baby you should get some money in the letter that I mailed two days ago
But when I wrote the letter saying you could come to me I didn't know
That I was goin' to lose my job in such a little while

Now I guess we'll have to change our plan
They may not hire me in Columbus but I'm pretty sure they will
Cause they're looking for an able bodied man

But just simple manual labor is the only kind of work that I can do

And all it's gonna cost is ten years of my life

I've been roughed up and shook down and stood on my ear
I've tried to find work but they called me a jailbird
So I went for the bundle and I've wound up back here

So we took turns a starin' out window at the darkness
Till boredom overtook us and he commenced to speak.

He said, ""Son I made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what the cards were by the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I would give you some advice.""

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he'd bummed a cigarette then he bummed a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
He said, ""If you gonna play the game boy you gotta learn to play it right.""

""You, you gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away, know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin' is done.""

""Now, every gambler knows that the secret to survival
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowin' what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner just like every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.""

So when he finished speaking he turned back toward the window
Crushed out his cigarette, faded off to sleep
Somewhere in the darkness the gambler he broke even
In his final words I found an ace that I could keep.

Know when to walk away, know when to run

Sometimes you sing for the dewy eyed darlings
Still makes them cry don't you know
Sometimes you sing for the glory but glory don't last very long
And through the haze of the stage can you look back to days
When you used to sing for the song
Sing for the song boy just like you did when you stood on that corner
And didn't even feel the glow
Sing for the song boy just like you did before all of the flash bulbs
And cocaine and bright things and ladies got hold of your soul

But you really don't make too much money and you donn't give much of a show
And them dewy eyed darling next week will be crying
For somebody else don't you know
But the music's become your burden and the words all sound twisted and wrong
And the hits that you sell don't taste quite as well

She's pretty to look at but she don't earn her keep

She can roar like the west wind, she can weep, she can wail

But the tunes that she plays just ain't sellin' today

This guitar is for sale.


She lay close beside me on cold winter nights

She's got me in trouble and she won me some fights

We both come out all right

She knows all the sad songs that Hank ever wrote

Just touch her once gently and she'll take you on home

She'll tell you some stories 'bout junk yards and jails

And a fool with a song and a dream that went wrong

This guitar is for sale.


She's rode cross this country on freight trains and trucks

On 'round pawnshop windows when we're down on our luck

We been down on our luck

So please treat her kind, keep her out of the rain

It's funny you're askin', I never gave her a name

But if you say she looks weary, you been readin' our mail

So if you got the dough buddy take her and go

This guitar is for sale.


She's won me some ladies with her sweet lovin' songs

And she's stuck right here with me when the ladies were gone

And the ladies are gone

But hard times and trouble been doggin' our tail

So if you got the dough buddy take her and go

This guitar is for sale...


",This Guitar Is for Sale,1978
Bobby Bare,"Midnight flights and barroom lights and rollin' for three days and nights
And motel rooms have been my only home
They gave me these sad knowing eyes and old age lines before my time
I guess I spent too many nights alone
Denver trains and LA games taxis through the New York rain
On everybody's party but my own
Tellin' myself love could wait now maybe girl you've come too late
I may have spent too many nights alone
I never let nobody any closer than my body and I never needed someone till now
And you know I want so much to reach out my soul and touch you
But I don't know if I know how
Cause midnight flights and barroom lights and rollin' for three days and nights
And open roads have been my only home
Learnin' ways to say goodbye and songs that only make me cry
I guess I spent too many nights alone too many nights alone




",Too Many Nights Alone,1978
Bobby Bare,"Show me a house with a yard full o' rusty cars
And you know there'll be a coffee perkin' on a rusty stove
And you walk right in, sit down and feel right at home
In the kitchen of the house of the man with a yard full o' rusty cars

Show me a man with a yard full o' rusty cars
And you know he's got a fridge full o' beer and it's nice and cold.
Swing on the porch, eat balony and bread and talk about gettin' old.
Spittin' in the dust with the man with a yard full o' rusty cars.

Scratchin' the ears of the dog of the man with a yard full o' rusty cars.
Tell him I been to Haite an' he says â??well 'at's real niceâ??.
Â??Hay, Ma, this beer could sure use a little bit o' iceâ??
Â??Now what was you sayin' about goin' to Hades?â?? says the man with a yard full o' rusty cars.

â??Ma' teeth gone badâ?? says the man with a yard full o' rusty cars.
Â??Toylet's on the blink and heavyweights today can't hit.â??
Â??You know you remind me a lot o' my brother's youngest kid.â??
Â??Got killed in Korea. You play gin rummy?â?? says the man with a yard full o' rusty cars.

Kick off your shoes on the couch of the man with a yard full o' rusty cars.
Smoke your smokes and flick the ashes on the floor.
Â??Hell son, everythin' here's been burned or broke at least once beforeâ??.
And he winks at his old lady and she winks back at the man with a yard full o' rusty cars.

â??Lord!â?? says the man with the rusty cars â??that woman's gettin' wide!â??
Â??So much for beauty son! Hand me that TV guide.â??

Watching the flies in the kitchen of the man with a yard full o' rusty cars.
Hole in the screen door where the dogs crawl in and out.
Â??Careful with that soup son. It'll burn a hole in your mouth!â??
Â??Soup an' life, you gotta wait 'em out.â?? says the man with a yard full o' rusty cars.

Watch TV in the parlour of the man with a yard full o' rusty cars.
Â??Son, you ever get to sleep with any o' them movie stars?â??
Â??I'd like to do that once before I dieâ?? but he's talking a little too loud,
And his woman's smilin' kinda proud of the man with a yard full o' rusty cars.

Talking God and baseball with the man with a yard full o' rusty cars.
Fall asleep right on the couch there where ya' sit
An' you know that his old woman ain't gonna mind a bit,
Leastwise she don't mention nothin' to that smilin', smokin', dirty jokin', lucky old man with a yard full o' rusty cars.

The sandman told me he's done all he can

The situation calls for more than sand

You been cryin' all night long

Tossin' and turnin' and it's almost dawn

I am here I'm gonna help you sleep

Count on me instead of countin' sheep

Close your eyes and leave the rest of me.


You'll have sweet dreams that'll last all night

And easy feeling in the morning light

Drift away with the touch of the hand

From the sleep tight goodnight man.


Soft and soothing as a lullaby

I'll kiss the tears from those weary eyes

And in the morning you will understand

You've been touched by the goodnight man

I'll rock you gently like a rolling wave

Hold you in my arms till you drift away

Just lay back and leave the rest to me.


You'll have sweet dreams that'll last all night

And easy feeling in the morning light

Drift away with the touch of the hand

From the sleep tight goodnight man.

Remember the nights we would jam in the motels

After the honky tonks closed

No one had credit

And no one had no place to go.


Just crazy kids with 'lectric machines

And some soul

Turnin' them crowds on

By playin' some loud rock'n roll.


Then came the man with a suit and a tie

And the promise of contracts and bread

With all our joy he gave us to fame and fortune

That left us half dead.


Goin' up's easy

When you got the song

That comes from the depth of the soul

Where it really belongs.


Comin' down's hard when you find

That you just can't sing it no more

Your emerald ring with the solid gold band

Reflects back the face of a whore.


Freddie would play on his guitar all day

And sometimes his firgers would bleed

Sam would ride on his drum

Like a magnificent steed.


Ben on the bass would make the thunder

And the lighting with love

And I'd sing the lyric of life

That I felt the part of.


Then came the money and Freddie dropped out

To start him a band of his own

Sam bought a frenchise and Bennie OD'd

And I'm soon the label alone.


Goin' up's easy

When you got the song

That comes from the depth of the soul

Where it really belongs.

And after five I'm always found at Dottie's Bar and Grill
I talked with all the local crowd a couple hours more
Then head for home where she is always waiting at the door

When I got home this evening about a half past ten
And found she wasn't waiting so I let myself on in
I headed for the icebox to get myself a beer
And found that little note that said my baby wasn't there

There was a bathroom tissue paper letter hanging on the wall
She said I just can't take no more and you can have it all
I'm taking what good sense I've got and leaving you behind
And you can take this letter and wipe me from your mind
Yeah you can take this letter and wipe me from your mind

I spit in your eye and gave your wrist a twist

In front of your apartment I waited all night long
To see who you'd come home with and if he done you wrong
Then I slapped your face and I stepped on his
And if that ain't love what is

I called up the police swore that you stole my car
Showed some naked pictures of you down at the bar
Pointed out the part of me you used to kiss
And if that ain't love what is

If that ain't love then a Cadillac ain't a car
And if you'd rather be with him than me
You're a stupider bitch than I think you are
I tore up your clothes threw 'em out in the rain
Flushed your birth control pills down the drain
If you don't want mine you can't have his
And if that ain't love what is

Sold my guitar and got my gun out of hock
Took a shot at you bare but I deliberatly missed

And she crawls in beside you with biscuits and kisses until all your hungers're fed
Then she opens the paper and reads how them rodeo rowdies have rolled into town
Then she's gone with the wind and you shook off again
And here's how it looks from the ground

And if you think about it you will take the fall lovin' a rodeo queen

Do you know the reason for his success (no we don't so tell us)
They say that he was double blessed (not like those fellas)
They say that Stacy Brown was born just a little bit deformed

Singin' everybody got one (everybody got one)...

Why they're climbin' up the wall (just to get to Stacy)

I just met the sweetest woman of my long dismal life
But a friend of mine said buddy just in case your mind is muddy
Don't you know that girl you're fooling with is Peg-Leg Johnson's wife
And that man is hard and cold and mean and grim
And he'll catch you and he'll brain you with his artificial limb
But next morning bright and early I stole old Peg-Leg's girlie
And I also took his wooden leg just to play it safe
But there weren't no time for laughter cause he started hopping after
And I keep on running faster but he won't give up the chase
And I'm running through the mountains with his bride
And I got his wooden leg here by my side
I'm a three-legged man with a two-legged woman
Being chased across country by a one-legged fool
Though he's hoppin' and he's clappin' and he shows no sign of stoppin'
I tell you boys this life is hard and cruel

Through the deserts and the valleys and those dark Chicago alleys
Cross the muddy Mississippi to the hills of Caroline
Through the mountains of Montana and the swamps of Louisiana
Each time that I look back he's just about one foot behind
And I know he must be cold and wet and sick
But in spite of all his troubles he can kick
Oh he's ragged and he's filthy and I'm feeling kinda guilty
Specially in the evenings when I hear him plead and beg
He says in spite of all your stealing friend I bear you no hard feelings
You can keep that damned old woman but please give me back my leg
Cause old friend I know you think you took my wooden leg
But in the dark you made a mistake you took my good leg
I'm a three-legged man...

In the moments that were set aside for sleeping
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping

Bobby Bare,"I come from just the other side of nowhere to this big time lonesome town
They got a lotta ice and snow here half as cold as all the people I found
Every way I've tried to go here seems to bring me down
And I seen about enough to know where I belong
I've got a mind to see the headlight
Shinin' on that old white line between my heart and home
Sick of spendin' Sundays wishing they were Mondays sittin' in a park alone
So give my best to anyone who's left who's ever done me any lovin' way but wrong
And tell 'em that the pride of just the other side of nowhere's going home

Taking nothing back to show there for these dues that I've paid
But the soul I almost sold here and the body I've been given away
Fadin' from the neon night time glow here headin' for the light of day
Just the other side of nowhere's going home
I've got a mind to see the headlight",Just the Other Side of Nowhere,1987

Already I'm so lonesome, I could die

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go

'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again

There are so many times, I've let you down
So many times, I've played around
I tell you now that they don't mean a thing

Bobby Bare,"I'm looking for that Lonely Street I've got a sad sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep where's this place called Lonely Street
A place where there's just loneliness where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet where's this place called Lonely Street

Perhaps upon that Lonely Street there's someone such as I

Bobby Bare,"The years creep slowly by Lorena snow is on the grass again
The sun is sinking low Lorena frost is where the flowers have been
The music softly plays Lorena happy sounds have left today
The music's sad and low Lorena where once it rang so loud and gay

Bobby Bare,"Morning comes and she's sleeping beside me I'm not ashamed that she's lying there
Her lips are still warm from the love she just gave me
She's contented with sweet dreams we shared

Soon I know that she will awaken with the smile that strips my soul bare
While I wait for her smile and the sunshine that follows I offer to heaven this prayer
Please Lord let me love her forever and keep her just the way she is now

She's tender and warm she's mine for the asking
My sweetheart my treasure my prayer

Bobby Bare,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

Bobby Bare,"People starin' at me as they wheel me down the ramp toward my plane
The war is over for me I've forgotten everything except the pain
Thank you sir and yes sir it was worth it for the old red-white-and-blue
And since I won't be walking I suppose I'll save some money buying shoes
The bottle hidden underneath the blanket over my two battered legs
I can see see the stewardess make over me and ask were you afraid

I say why no I'm Superman and couldn't find a phone booth quite in time
A G-I gets a lotta laughs if he remembers all the funny lines
Mama bake a pie daddy kill a chicken your son is comin' home 11:35 Wednesday night
Mama will be crying daddy's gonna say son did they treat you good
My uncle will be drunk and he'll say boy they do some real great things with wood

The letter that she wrote me said goodbye she couldn't wait and lots of luck
The bottle underneath the blanket feels just like an old friend to my touch
I know she'll come and see me but I bet she never once looks at my legs
She'll talk about the weather and the dress she wore the July 4th Parade
Lord I love her and I don't believe this bottle's gonna get her off my mind

Bobby Bare,"I saved up my money to buy my sweetheart some flowers
For Saturday's date and I restlessly counted the hours
And today in the mail I received a short little note
And I broke down inside the message that her mother wrote

Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
We're leaving for Europe next week, she'll be busy till then
They know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plans
Goodbye, true love, goodbye, my sweet Mary Ann

The weeks have gone by, not a word have I heard since then
In the papers I read of the far away places she's been
I can't eat, I can't sleep for over and over again
My mind reads that letter and I cry for my Mary Ann, Mary Ann regrets

My Mary Ann died, they said she just wasted away
My Mary had died too sad, she just wasted away

If I could have seen her I know she'd be living today
For we loved each other and if they had left us alone
Today she'd be wearing my ring, not a blanket of stone

Bobby Bare,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me

Well how far away is the city you know that's a great big town
And Barbara said why it's a million miles and then the story got around
It's a million miles to the city from the hills and valleys we know
It's a million miles to the city and some day we all wanna go

There was a town nearby but a town is a town and a city that's somethin' else

While I watched in a dream and dreamed as I watched

Short and sweet were those good old songs of yesterday

I-I bought me a guitar a year ago 
Learned how to play in a day or so

That I was knockin' 'em out like Johnny B. Goode
Hot licks, showin' off, ah number one.

Well , I 'd practice all day and up into the night

Cause he didn't like rock'n'roll
He said ""You can stay, boy, but that's gotta go.""
He's a square, he just didn't dig me at all

So I took my guitar, picks and all
And bid farewell to my poor ole pa
And I split for Memphis where they say all
Them swingin' cats are havin' a ball
Sessions, hot licks and all, they dig me

I was rockin' and boppin' and I's a gettin' the breaks

Bobby Bare,"Ten years ago on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

The judge he said, ?Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else then you won't have to die?
I spoke not a word although it meant my life
For I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high and eternity was near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In the long black veil, she cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me",Long Black Veil,1994

But her train just pulled out of sight I know she's gone for good

So Charleston Railroad Tavern...

I stayed out so many nights the crowd downtown was fun
But her love had turned to hate before I knew the harm I'd done

I had a tall drink of yesterday's wine
Left a long string of friends, some sheets in the wind
And some satisfied women behind

We left our kin and all our friends back there in Tennessee
I bought those one way tickets she had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore
Her heart was filled with laughter when she saw those city lights
She said the prettiest place on earth is Baltimore at night
Oh well a man feels proud to give his woman what she's longing for
And I kind of liked the streets of Baltimore
Well I got myself a factory job I ran an old machine
I bought a little cottage in a neighborhood serene
Yet every night when I came home with every muscle sore
She would drag me through the streets of Baltimore
Well I did my best to bring her back to what she used to be
But I soon learned she loved those bright lights much more than she loved me

Bobby Bare,"The hulk of a man with a beer in his hand he looked like a drunk old fool
And I knew if I hit him right why I could knock him off of that stool
But everybody they said watch out hey that's the Tiger Man McCool
He's had the whole lotta fights and he's always come out winner yeah he's a winner
But I had myself about five too many and I walked up tall and proud
I faced his back and I faced the fact that he had never stooped or bowed
I said Tiger Man you're a pussycat and a hush fell on the crowd
I said let's you and me go outside and see who's the winner
Well he gripped the bar with one big hairy hand then he braced against the wall
He slowly looked up from his beer my God that man was tall
He said boy I see you're a scrapper so just before you fall
I'm gonna tell you just a little bout what it means to be a winner
He said now you see these bright white smilin' teeth you know they ain't my own
Mine rolled away like Chicklets down the street in San Antone
But I left that person cursin' nursin' seven broken bones
And he only broke ah three of mine that makes me the winner
He said now behind this grin I got a steel pin that holds my jaw in place
A trophy of my most successful motorcycle race
And each morning when I wake and touch this scar across my face
It reminds me of all I got by bein' a winner
Now this broken back was the dyin' act of a handsome Harry Clay
That sticky Cincinnati night I stole his wife away
But that woman she gets uglier and she gets meaner every day
But I got her boy that's what makes me a winner
He said you gotta speak loud when you challenge me son cause it's hard for me to hear
With this twisted neck and these migraine pains and this big ole cauliflower ear
And if it wadn't for this glass eye of mine why I'd shed a happy tear
To think of all that you gonna get by bein' a winner
I got arthritic elbows boy I got dislocated knees
From pickin' fights with thunderstorms and chargin' into trees
And my nose been broke so often I might lose if I sneeze
And son you say you still wanna be a winner
Now you remind me a lotta my younger days with your knuckles a clenchin' white
But boy I'm gonna sit right here and sip this beer all night
And if there's somethin' that you gotta gain to prove by winnin' some silly fight
Well okay I quit I lose you're the winner
So I stumbled from that barroom not so tall and not so proud
And behind me I still hear the hoots of laughter of the crowd
But my eyes still see and my nose still works and my teeth're still in my mouth
And you know I guess that makes me the winner

Tell me, what are we gonna do about your husband?
And what're we gonna do about your wife?

And though we want each other
Need each other and we love each other
Think about the move we are making

Oh baby, don't you cry
No matter what, we'll never ever say goodbye
And Bobby, I promise you this
Though I wear his ring, I'll always wear your kiss

But as for marriage, we can't pay the price

Bobby Bare,"Well I've been a trucker more than twenty years
From the Charleston coast to the Jersey piers
Sharin' the road with race car nuts and loggers
Sunday drivers scouts on hikes Hells Angels on Harley bikes
I never met a roader I didn't like cept them joggers

One day I'm rollin' down 1-0-1
I got 18 wheels under 14-tons
Radio playin' a good ol' country rocker
The day was sure a trucker's dream
The sky was sunny and the air was clean
When up ahead on the road I seen one of them joggers

He was dressed like they do in baby blue
With shortie shorts and a headband too
I yelled Sweetie I bet that you are the hit of the men's room locker
But I'm a runnin' late with an overload
So get your Adidas off a this road
I'm LA bound and I don't slow down for dead raccoons or joggers

Well without breakin' stride or losin' poise
He said you and that rig sure make some noise
But I can't talk now cause I'm racin' against the clocker
But it's just nine miles to Forkers Leap
And if you ain't afraid to race that heap
We'll see how that ol' rig holds up against a super jogger

Race I must be hearin' wrong
The boy's been runnin' in the sun too long
The only place he's racin' to is a doctor's
But before I could say thank you no
That fool yells ready get set go
And the race is on we're off and gone me and that maniac jogger

Well I could've left him far behind
But I played with him like a fish on a line
And I stayed about a half a mile behind that sucker
Then I pushed her up to forty-five
And he sees me comin' and he starts to fly
So I pushed her to sixty and shift to high and finally catch that jogger
And it wasn't easy

Now I'm doin' eighty and I turned to check
And he's stayin' right with me neck in neck
His hearts a thumpin' like my engine goin' pop pop pocker
Then he yells out I hope you're set
Cause I ain't shifted into second yet
Then he unwinds and leaves me behind eaten the dust of a jogger

Then I see him joggin' up into the sky
And he yells hey thanks for the exercise
I hope that losin' this race was not too shockin'
Ya see my dad says heaven's no place to run
And I try to be an obedient son
So I have to come down to earth to do my joggin'

Well that's my story take it or leave it
My trucker buddies they believe it
So do those race car nuts and Harley hoggers
And I'm still drivin' much the same
Cept I don't call nobody names
And I tip my hat each time I pass one of them good old joggers

Hey here comes one now... Hey good buddy
How ya doin?
Want some gatorade?

And the newspaper print is becomin' so small
And folks talk so soft you can barely hear at all it's time just time
Jokes aren't as witty as the old jokes once were
And the girls ain't half as pretty as I remember her
And today on the bus a grown man called me sir it's time just time

You know I ain't quite as anxious for fame or success
And my eye finds the girl in the plain simple dress
And I cling a bit longer to each warm caress that's time just time

I was sittin' in Friday's suckin' on a glass of wine

When in walked a chick who almost struck me blind

Had wet blue eyes and her legs were long and fine

On a scale of one to ten, I'd give her a nine.


Now on my scale there ain't no ten's, you know

Nine is about as far as any chick can go

So I flashed her a smile, but she didn't even look at me

So for brains and good judgement, I'd give her a three.


I said, ""Hey sweet thing, you look like a possible eight

You and me could, uh! make eighteen, if your head's on straight.""

She looked up and down my perfect frame

And said these words that burned into my perfect brain.


She said, well, another one of those macho-matician men

Kind who grade all women on scales of one to ten

And, you give me an eight, well, that's a generous thing to do

Now, let's just see, just how much I give you.


She said you comin' on to me with that phony numbers jive

Your style makes me smile, I give it a five

When you walked up I noticed that suit of (yores)

It's last year's double-knit frayed-cuffs, give it a four.


That must be your car parked out on the curb

That sixty-nine homemade convertible, a three and a third

Now, as for your build, I guess (yore) less than five

Except, for your pot belly, I'd give that a ten for size.


That wine you're pourin' might be fine to you

But I'm used to fine champagne, I give it a two

It's hard to tell what your flashin' smile is worth

I give it a six, you could use some dental work.


But, It's your struttin' rooster act that really makes me laugh

It may be a ten to these country hens, but to me a three and a half

And there really ain't much to add once the subtractin's done

Since there ain't no zeroes, I give you a one!.


She walked out, while up and down the line

The whole bar was laughin', said' Bare, what happened to your nine

Nine says I, hell soon as she started to talk I knew

She didn't have no class, I barely gave her a two.


Spoken:

Yeah! No matter how good they look at first

There's flaws in all of them

That's why on a scale of ten to one, friend

There ain't no ten.

Bobby Bare,"You don't want no more heartaches
And I don't want no  teardrops
What else is love to talk about
Cause I  ain't yours you ain't mine
The song don't fit and the words don't rhyme
Old memories keep standing in the way

You lost her I lost him
Two old hearts just won't love again
We don't need no memories hanging round

Since she's gone it don't seem right
Better off left alone at night
I ain't faking feelings far away
The days just come and disappear
You can't talk when I don't hear
It don't make no difference anyway

I lost her you lost him
Two old hearts just won't love again

Bobby Bare,"I have pawned my golden records I have sold my sequent suits
For a bottle of bad whiskey I gave up my fancy boots
Now I stand here on the corner with a sad sad tail to tell
Once a rock star now a drunker with no song left to sell

Hide a face you might remember hide a voice you may recall
It was that cold night in December when we played Carnegie Hall
Now we're smokin' marijuana singin' flat but doin' well
Till I took my first drink of whiskey we started down the road to hell

I have pawned my golden records. I have sold my sequent suits
For a bottle of bad whiskey I gave up my fancy boots
Now I stand here on the corner with a sad sad tail to tell

Bobby Bare,"I hear the train a comin'
It's rollin' 'round the bend,
And I ain't seen the sunshine,
Since, I don't know when,
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison,
And time keeps draggin' on,
But that train keeps a-rollin',
On down to San Antone.

When I was just a baby,
My Mama told me, ""Son,
Always be a good boy,
Don't ever play with guns,""
But I shot a man in Reno,
Just to watch him die,
When I hear that whistle blowin',
I hang my head and cry.

I bet there's rich folks eatin',
In a fancy dining car,
They're probably drinkin' coffee,
And smokin' big cigars,
But I know I had it comin',
I know I can't be free,
But those people keep a-movin',
And that's what tortures me.

Well, if they freed me from this prison,
If that railroad train was mine,
I bet I'd move it on a little,
Farther down the line,
Far from Folsom Prison,
That's where I want to stay,
And I'd let that lonesome whistle,
Blow my Blues away.",Folsom Prison Blues,2001
Bobby Bare,"The corn was dry and the weeds were high
When daddy took to drinking
Then him and Lucy Walker they took up and ran away
Mama cried a tear and then she promised fourteen children

I swear you'll never see a hungry day
Oh, the path was deep and wide from footsteps leading to our cabin

Above the door there burned the scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock
And there would stand a stranger
Yes I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp

When mama sacrificed her pride the neighbors started talkin'
But I was much too young
To understand the things they said
The things that mattered most of all was mama's chicken dumplings

And the goodnight kiss before we went to bed
Oh, the path was deep and wide

When daddy left then destitution came upon our family
Not one neighbor volunteered to give a helping hand
So let 'em gossip all they want she loved us and she raised us
The proof is standing here a full grown man

Last summer mama passed away and left the ones who loved her
Each and everyone of us were more than grateful for our birth
Now every Sunday she receives a fresh bouquet of fourteen roses
With a card that says to the greatest mom on earth

Oh, the path was deep and wide
Yes I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp

Bobby Bare,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk

Interstate 90 is a sight to behold
But that monument to progress and engineering skill
Has covered up the old swimmin' hole

But it never can compare with the food for the soul
You could get for a dip in the old swimmin' hole
Oh the old swimmin' hole her cool waters ran deep
Felt good to a boy with mud on his feet
And I'm wishing these days I could strip to my soul
And go for a dip in the old swimmin' hole

Entombed beneath a blanket of concrete and steel

Remember the nights we would jam in the motels

After the honky tonks closed

No one had credit

And no one had no place to go.


Just crazy kids with 'lectric machines

And some soul

Turnin' them crowds on

By playin' some loud rock'n roll.


Then came the man with a suit and a tie

And the promise of contracts and bread

With all our joy he gave us to fame and fortune

That left us half dead.


Goin' up's easy

When you got the song

That comes from the depth of the soul

Where it really belongs.


Comin' down's hard when you find

That you just can't sing it no more

Your emerald ring with the solid gold band

Reflects back the face of a whore.


Freddie would play on his guitar all day

And sometimes his firgers would bleed

Sam would ride on his drum

Like a magnificent steed.


Ben on the bass would make the thunder

And the lighting with love

And I'd sing the lyric of life

That I felt the part of.


Then came the money and Freddie dropped out

To start him a band of his own

Sam bought a frenchise and Bennie OD'd

And I'm soon the label alone.


Goin' up's easy

When you got the song

That comes from the depth of the soul

Where it really belongs.


Goin' up's easy

When you got the song

That comes from the depth of the soul

Where it really belongs...

Before you break my heart

Baby, baby, I'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love you'll meet
This time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt
(think it over) after I've been good to you ?
(think it over) after I've been sweet to you ?

Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've known of your, your secluded nights
I've even seen her maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?
But this time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
(think it over) haven't I been good to you?
(think it over) haven't I been sweet to you?

Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've tried so hard, hard to be patient
Hoping you'll stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid I'll be losing you forever

Ride with a stunna
You know that I'm winning
Headed to the top
I ball, no 9th inning
Pop bottles in the club
Yes, we can
I don't even care if you a lesbian
That just means we got some common interest
Spark my trees then I'll spark your interest
Okay
Let's pop some bubbly
Tell me you in love with me
No golf, but club with me; I'm big like double Ds
Poppin' in cities I ain't heard of
Let me see your titties
Baby, pull that shirt up
Lift that skirt up; got buns like a burger
Do the most, not the minimum
You not a wage worker

[Chorus]

Call up your local station
If you hear this on the radio
I'm calling up Ray J thinking about the video
If we make a video, I'm a need a scene with dimes
In t-shirts that say 143
I got my video all on t.v (wa' wa' what next, Bob?)
We gone drop the E.P.
Throwing dubs in the club at the dance club
Or at the strip club; it's 143 love
Or settle at a playa location
Made another hit for the radio station
143 to the cutie from the club
Stick shift love 143 so clutch

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,1995

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

I treat you sweet, take you out at night
But you never say thanks girl that ain't right
I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls
I took you for a cruise all around the world
I treat you high post but you play me close
If I want to drink up you won't even toast

Girl, I work so hard for you from 9 to 5
So you could have the finer things in life

Bobby Brown,"You know a man likes a good time
He likes to wine and then dine
A beautiful woman
And love her through the night
And if the lovin' feels right
He likes to do her two times
Pleasing that woman
Until she's satisfied
But when all the love is done
Who wants love that's on the run?
One good time, but there's so much more
How 'bout conversation, some communication
Someone who loves you and stimulates your mind, baby

A pretty little girl just ain't gonna get it
I need a woman
I need the kinda girl who keeps on
Usin' her mind all of the time, baby
A pretty little girl just ain't gonna get it

All of the time, all of her life

You know a man likes to have fun
He likes to get into some tender young roni's
As pretty as they come
He likes to love all night long
And makes 'em feel they got it goin' on
Sometimes, it's lonely, 'cause there's know one at home
But when all the peaks are done
Know one still knows anyone
We've had fun, but I need so much more

I'm not ashamed to say, that I've been that kinda guy
Didn't want no lady, I just wanted a good time
But now, I think I'm ready for love
I need a woman that'll give it up
Someone to love me
And someone to be right by my side, baby

But now I understand what those mistakes were for Throughout my travels girl I realized
What you see, what you get don't always coincide
A bird in the hand beats two in a bush
But just one look was all it took
Could it be thayt we're the only ones thinking of
Harmony, ecstacy, there's something about this love

We, we have something in common
Girl (Boy) you mean so much to me it should be plain to see That we... We have something in common
It's the way we feel about each other when we're together

Now I'm the type of girl who understands my man
I'll be strong when he's weak, I will hold his hand
Now I believe old fashioned rules and old fashioned ways Courtesy, honesty, like in the old days
You're my man and I'm your girl
There's nothing better in this whole wide world
I'll stand by your side till the very end

Bobby Brown,"You better make tracks fast on the double
The girl jazz you but she's nothing but trouble

Take her where she wants to go
And ev'ry day you let her know
She's the one who's always on your mind
But she just cops an attitude and leads you off and leaves you blue
Can't you see she's really just a waste of time?
One day she'll treat you nice
Then she'll turn as cold as ice
But you think your love will win her in the end, think again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, oo
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me I know
I know better than, better than, better than you

She gets you but then leaves you cold
And keeps you waitin' on the phone
'cause you know you'll alway give her on more try
I'm not the only boy in town
And she loves me into the ground
But tell me, do you really like standing in line?
Give her ev'rything you have and all it does is make you sad
What she really wants to do is tell her friends she did it again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, oo
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me I know
I know better than, better than, better than you

I'd like to say she used to be my girl
But that would be a lie
'Cause there's no one in this whole wide world
That could keep her satisfied
I know, 'cause I tried

One thing I hate is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
'Cause I tried to make you mine for the last time
So take this key as a kiss and a good-bye
She ain't worth it even though she's on a high tip
She better get a grip and get a grip quick
Fast in a hurry 'cause I won't buckle
The girl's jazzy but she's nothin' but trouble
Give her ev'rything you have all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do is tell her friends she did it again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, oo
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me I know
I know better than, better than, better than you

People say I'm the life of the party
Because I live the way that I do
But they don't know what it's like to be Bobby
The pressure has me so confuse

I live my life the way I want

That nothing for nothing leaves nothing

But there's just one thing I gotta say

Things just ain't the way that they used to be
Back in the day when a man meant security
He'd be working hard all week
Baby kick back and throw up your feet
Let me fix you a treat
So it might be love and sweet

But he's worth it
He deserves it
May not be perfect
But he's all the man I need
He's ready and willing
Gives me the feeling, ah
And whenever we're together
I know where I belong

It's just the way he looks into your eyes
Love that man
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
Love that man
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there (He's always always there)
Don't you love that man (I know)

Things they ain't the way they used to be
When a woman and a man work hard to be
Happy in love and stand together ooh
(Let's stay that way forever)

Never give in to a fight
Just trying work it out
Never give up on him
That's not what love's about
Stay true to your feelings
And remember
All the things he's done for you

It's just the way he looks into your eyes
Love that man
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
Love that man
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there (He's always always there)

That everlasting feeling can never be too much

Soon they will be leaving without you
Say that you love someone
Why are you calling all my friends
Thinking I've got something to hide
Girl you don't love no one
You don't know what love's all about
You lose the game, (if you) if you play that way

[CHROUS]
Nobody x7
Humpin' around babe

Girl if you trust someone
You don't call on everybody
Ain't nobody foolin' around
And the more I think about it
You lose all your clout and
You lose the game, baby, if you play that way

[CHORUS]
Girl you said you love me
And you said you trust me
Why do you think I'm foolin' around
I can't stand the pressure
You know I'm yours forever
Ain't nobody, nobody, humpin' around

That's okay, that's okay
It's when they stop talkin' about you

It's when they stop talkin' about you
Is when you worry, is when you worry

Listen up, yeah
See all of the rumors and lies that they spread
They'll only say something good about me when I am dead
There never were right and wrongs they done to you
And nobody knows when you loose

You should let them go
They mean you no good, as you know
The heart full of hate and they never will change
Till their dying day, they're always gonna be the same way
So let them walk on, talk on

Bobby Brown,"Girl, the only thing that matters in my life
Is that I'm down for you and treat you right
You've got no call to treat me cold as ice

Oh, girl, as long as I've been givin' my love to you
You should be givin' me your love, too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

Uh, don't be cruel
'Cause I would never be that cruel to you
Uh no, oh oh, no, uh, don't be cruel
Uh, girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh no, oh, uh don't be cruel

Hey, yo', cutey what's up with this attitude
I thought I was bein' real good to you
I treat you sweet, take you out at night
But you never say thanks, girl, that ain't right

I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls
I took you for a cruise all around the world
I treat you high post but you play me close
If I want to drink up you won't even toast

Girl, I work so hard for you from nine to five
So you could have the finer things in life
Since you're the kind that's never satisfied

Oh, girl, as long as I've been givin' my heart to you
You should be givin' me your heart too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

Uh, don't be cruel
'Cause I would never be that cruel to you
Uh no, oh oh, no, uh, don't be cruel
Uh, girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh no, oh, uh don't be cruel

From fancy cars to diamond rings
I've just about given you everything
There's really not much I won't do for you
I bought you twelve yellow roses and candy too

I like be up front and never play the back
But the way you treat me, girl, is like a heart attack
I'm real troop trooper and with all the times
That you were by my side diggin' dollars outta crock

Oh, girl, as long as I've been givin' my love to you
You should be givin' me your love too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool, it just ain't cool
Uh, don't be cruel

We used to hang out tough just kickin' around
We discovered a love that had never been found
You gave me your heart, I gave you my mind
But a true love affair we could never find

Although I want you bad, I could let you go
'Cause there's a lot of girls out there that won't say no
But due to fact that I want you, Jackie
I want you more than human eyes can see

But you had to start givin', tryin' to make a killin'
Thought about the dollars I make and you were willin'
To be with me Bobby B
But with a bad attitude I can't compete

Now you know my name, now I know your game
You want to be with me you got to be the same way
That another girl would be
And if you wanna be with me

Uh, don't be cruel
'Cause I would never be that cruel to you

Regularly, physically communicating sexually, scientifically penetrating
Until she start spiritually resonating

The girl jazz you but she's nothing but trouble

Take her where she wants to go
And ev'ry day you let her know
She's the one who's always on your mind
But she just cops an attitude and leads you off and leaves you blue
Can't you see she's really just a waste of time?
One day she'll treat you nice
Then she'll turn as cold as ice
But you think your love will win her in the end, think again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, oo
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me I know
I know better than, better than, better than you

She gets you but then leaves you cold
And keeps you waitin' on the phone
'cause you know you'll alway give her on more try
I'm not the only boy in town
And she loves me into the ground
But tell me, do you really like standing in line?
Give her ev'rything you have and all it does is make you sad
What she really wants to do is tell her friends she did it again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, oo
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me I know
I know better than, better than, better than you

I'd like to say she used to be my girl
But that would be a lie
'Cause there's no one in this whole wide world
That could keep her satisfied
I know, 'cause I tried

One thing I hate is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
'Cause I tried to make you mine for the last time
So take this key as a kiss and a good-bye
She ain't worth it even though she's on a high tip
She better get a grip and get a grip quick
Fast in a hurry 'cause I won't buckle

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2001

Bobby Byrne,"He always runs while others walk
He acts while other men just talk
He looks at this world, and wants it all
So he strikes, like thunderball

He knows the meaning of success
His needs are more, so he gives less
They call him the winner who takes all
And he strikes, like thunderball

Any woman he wants, he'll get
He will break any heart without regret

His days of asking are all gone
His fight goes on and on and on
But he thinks that the fight is worth it all
