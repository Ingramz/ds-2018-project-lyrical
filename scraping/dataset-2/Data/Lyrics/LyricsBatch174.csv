Dr. Octagon,"The plane managed to land  the skeleton at the controls 
A place called the Twilight Zone 
Are extraterrestrials able to accomplish this? 
I will explain but you'd become more puzzled at the possibilities 
Earth ending trilogies, wacky stuff 
Like gas passing dinosaurs 
While I stroll in circles blindfolded 
Gave a lady some wrinkle cream out of rat poop 
You might just laugh so hard your skull cracks 
Brain spills thick blood shooting out like a champagne cork 
Females so horny and mean, sucking scales off of live rattlesnakes 
My boy gave his girl money for groceries, she got a new hairdo 
Women like this could even make the devil commit suicide 
hung from a tree on Johannesburg with no parachute 
Big-Bigfoot captured by UFO's 
Haloes were found, at the landing sites, vanishing 
Vanishing victims, kept alive on metal examining tables 
Ex-Experts baffled they could survive the caustic exposure 
to laser scalpels, green berets 
Flowing cold heads in mechanical wombs 
Radioactive constant temperature circular appendages 
Cripples start shaking sending distress signals 
We're not alone in the Twilight Zone 
""They waved among the trees at breakneck speed"" 

Keep it simple 

""They waved among the trees at breakneck speed"" 

Keep it simple 

Back in spiral, I roast humans like a gyro 
New York, Atlanta, Africa to Cairo 
Diplomat King Presidential offspring 
Two miles from Westinghouse, with lights down South 
Government chemical voodoo man miracle 
Super disease your brain is more hysterical 
My urine see paralyze your ability with space codes 
electrodes you're ready for a pap smear 
Wax in your inner ear, doodoo in your outer ear 
Two cows a zebra will jump through your atmosphere 
Giraffe-Funk will raise beamin through your trunk 
Steam of Legion, to burn up in your anal region 
Power contracting with bombs in his rectum factor 
Utilized phonic like water in your Panasonic 
Trip or slip or fall 
Right into the earth pit, gamma ray toilet 
Microbes on your earth shit 
Dr. Ludicrous, I turn into a octapus 
Grab eight species, isolate like an incubus 
Convert with probes, green shit is on your earlobes 
Attack what stomach with juice they call gastric 
Alien bugs with sickle cell, get they ass kicked 
Dermatologist examine more black cysts 
Radiation butter pouring down your sinus, it's Dr. Octagon 

""They waved among the trees at breakneck speed"" 

Keep it simple 

""They waved among the trees at breakneck speed"" 

Keep it simple 

Utilize to abuse minds 
Slice head halves, let's probe the subconcious lobe 
Mathematical parabola, ACT test and just ex-plorating 
the creative arctic regions, or isolating cockpit 
A regular pitstop monitoring with enough fuel to fly a small dirigible 
To a place an oasis in a nebula, Earth 
Universal charting unseen atmosphere 
Requesting assistance, I speed through waves like a Concorde SST 
Then open aperature 
The shape of Octagon selects forward morphing it's the vertical 
Frankenstein 
Prototype of like Kervorkian 
Mind pedestrian controls 
Spend elevation gobble the ignorant supersonic cruise 
Hidin to think, focus psychosis with Von Blowford 
Black lotus releases when life is flailing external 
terminal update, thermal conducted power source supplied 
Man on the moon pumps amps, or souped up cable boxes 
getting up impossible 
The speaker needs another dose, concoct 
Concoct the scenario view, in a position of a coroner 
describing current events bent on human dismemberment 
To a point of no resemblance 
We're not alone in the Twilight Zone 

""They waved among the trees at breakneck speed"" 

Keep it simple 

""They waved among the trees at breakneck speed"" 

Keep it simple 

Like Enoch, I wear my cape, you can't destroy 
my impeccable caliber that makes your vision blur 
I drop particle X when having Rhythm sex 
Voodoo arrangers with the kids Power Rangers 
Make me see other men, gorillas masterbating with human strangers 
Legally through court, you're stung by a genital wart 
Chlamydia, through the city-a 
Los Angeles Texas has a serpent that's urgent 
for the mass appeal biomedical test your rectum 
squeezing in banana peels 
Outwards backwards towards Boston 
It's costing androids leaving humans with hemerrhoids 
Thinking more of what they can't explore, like 
the cartoon Donald Duck is giving fellatio on the floor 
with Reed Richards, looking at The Thing's naked pictures 
Taking Ex-Lax to relax with the needle and thread 
sewing up all the other buttcracks 
In the industry there's no one who can mess with 
Dr. Octagon, now serving coleslaw and pink pickles 
""They waved among the trees at breakneck speed"" 

Keep it simple 

""They waved among the trees at breakneck speed... their bikes"" 

Keep it simple 

""Detached his bike, and leaped to safety 
Just before they collided with a tree...""",Dr. Octagon,1996
Dr. Octagon,"Verse 1 

First patient  pull out the skull  remove the cancer 

Breakin' his back  chisel necks for the answer 

Supersonic bionic robot voodoo power 

Equator ex my chance to flex skills on Ampex 

With power meters and heaters gauge anti freeze 

Octagon oxygen  aluminum intoxicants 

More ways to blow blood cells in your face 

React with four bombs and six fire missiles 

Armed with seven rounds of space doo-doo pistols 

You may not believe, livin' on the Earth planet

You recognised, so what? I turned invisible 

Made myself clear, reappeared to you visual

Computer File: Nine-Three 

Digital level, standing on the terminal 

Upside down through polygons fightin' pentagons 

Changin' blue skin, my brown colour's comin' back

Dr. Octagon,"I would have been completely dead had it not been for the shark man.
Shark man? 
Judging from his appearance, that’s the most appropriate
Name I could come up with for him.
I hate this kid.
This uh, thing you’re talking about.
It had the body of a shark, and the arms and face of a man?
That’s the chap.
Holy jumping jackfish!

Yes, you have met the dangerous 208 year-old uncle of dr. octagon.
I myself Mr. Gerbik. half-shark, half-man, skin like alligator.
Carrying a dead walrus. check it.

With my white eyes, gray hair, face is sky-blue yellow
Sideburns react, my skin is colored lilac
My skin turn orange and green in the limousine
People think I’m mixed with shark, drinking gasoline
Underwater I breathe and let loose on my sleeve
Walking down hollywood boulevard with a credit card
Three alligators behind me, feel my skin is hard
Transvestites, and people watch space parasites
I left his head in the store, legs in the street
Body in wilcox, with blood dripping off my feet
L.a.p.d. through gray clouds couldn’t see me
I first turned rainbow, closed my eyes, watch my brain glow
People got scared and ranned away they think I’m weird
I was born this way, halfsharkalligator
Is he weird? 

Half-shark-alligator-half-man
Half man, half shark!
Half-shark-alligator-half-man
Half man, half shark!

My vomit fluctuates, covers your skull like protoplasm
Lightning bugs turn pink, on my tongue catches spasms
Green elephants, I battle streets with a zebra
My mechanism is more than dionne’s psychic voodoo
African beads, snakeskins, cold script through you my medical passes
You can’t see, with greedy glasses
Carbon dioxide, pour right through em with gases
My description dinosaur
I was made half-shark-half-man, my skin is like razor blades
Seven-oh-seven, mr. gerbik
Verbally no one change my thoughts, animals fly from philly
My appetites more big it’s time for wildabeasts
Adjust my skulls, seven eyes switch hydraulic scribbles
And shrimps, mack gorillas like a pimp
Half-shark-alligator-man

Half-shark-alligator-half-man
Half man, half shark!
Half-shark-alligator-half-man
Half man, half shark!

Half-shark-alligator-half-man
Half man, half shark!
Half-shark-alligator-half-man
Half man, half shark!

In my real world, orangutangs dance for thanksgiving
With skeleton bones and skunk tails, is my mission
Holding backward raps to all my power packs
Babboons clap, and girl horses wanna hit the sack
We’re too bold for ocean water, monkeys sniffin ice
Contact jupiter pools martians bring my rice
I’m out flyin with purple capes in the twilight
Oooh ooh ooh, tonight’s the night
My oxygen region’s, new york to California
Half shark alligator half man!

It takes a supreme feat of strength to swim through
The water plows while dragging two hundred and
Fifty pounds on your back... the crocodile’s teeth
Are designed to seize and hold, not to cut through
Skin. during all the hours the somber lay in the water,
But are unable to penetrate the deer’s tough hide.
The crocodiles make a few token objections; but in the
End, give up the struggle.",Halfsharkalligatorhalfman,1996

Think about it, if you was there standing looking at me
What would you do, if I hit your face with dog doodoo?
Smear purple flies on your forehead
Spit in your salad, vomit on your brother's breakfast
Take your ass outside, burn your mother's house
Bring pet mice, and scare your sister with my gray mouse
Then drop him under the bed, and leave him there dead
Take out your parakeet, with scissors, clip his head
Then get the charcoal, whassup, burn your dog's legs
Walk by the barbershop, and hit the glass with eggs
Then go in the club and dance, mix the alcohol
Great with roach spray, here's a drink, have a ball
Dance to the music, watch it party pooper
Yeah, you know...
I'm destructive (4X)

Bash in your head with ten full cans of Campbell's soup
I'm on the roof, I'm not another pigeon out the chicken coop
Stole your checks, and flush money down the toilet bowl
Look at the frog, he's gone too down the commode
War paint on the carpet, your fur was my target
Give the baby some gum, a pack of BubbleYum
Stick it in the rugs, smearing green lightening bugs
all around the walls, down the halls
Checking out doodoo on flame pits, niggaz with they armpits
down, smellin funky, check out the junkie, spit
I'm destructive!! (4X)

Like a green red blue reindeer, dead lying down with a fawn
Copulating, having sex
Mating with a babboon with buffalo wings
Hahahahaha

Like Hitler, the German Shephard, coming down from the Bronx
fighting moose you sound as soft as a goose
We all hang with tickets for Van Halen
Orifice, Autopsy, Def Leppard and Spaz
c'mon, drop the jazz Grateful Dead, rock with it

Chewbacca's not here I'ma do it for your circumcised
niggaz don't realize my format is a palm spectrum
to damage any rectum
This is the real dinosaur funk which permitted G-Funk
to play anally through the trunk a digital master
was given to Sam Cooke and Jimmy Castor
Kurt Cobain was here but Doc Oc' has novacaine
Theoretically keepin puppies and the pedigree
Small fetus brought Santa Claus to greet us
Rappers know I'm equipped with Clorox
and chemicals that'll burn off your lip
Intestines investments hide money in your stomach
Who can stop Pepto Bismol?
Only a Gremlin eatin in Larry Parker like Gizmo
As Dr. Octagonecologyst girls open legs for beer kegs
French toast and herbs were covered with giant eggs
Livin small, people unequal challenge my thoughts
No station or radio will understand
The perfect enzyme is me with your brain in my other hand
Suck my oil, yo Gudio tell em

MP4, six spacecraft in the mix, kissin Mary J. Blige
on Earth was quite normal,

Who's the best to put me to the test
I'll battle Ultramagnetic, my own self as well
Two mirrors in the clear, I'm floating deep in the atmosphere
Through Los Angeles heights I'll damage Hollywood lights
Woman know my sex computer condoms humpin on Ampex
My number 2-7-5-49-69 disconnected
My first black robot, 
space connected while you listen to Keith Sweat (meow)
Your brain is caught up in a net
Two million thousand three billion wack records in the solar
The system's out of reach, niggaz try to preach
Why you tryin to act fly walkin up Venice Beach?
Zapp, like Roger, my funk is powerful then Troutman
Seven years ago like California was tooken from Mexico

Hold your pitbull back, let's spend some money on the elevator 

Your dog is bound to loose and have a funeral 

You can call landlords, injects on my rent checks 

Bug Man is back, you project people better watch their necks 

Spittin flim-flam, rappers still smokin crack 

Suckers get pantylined, and spots on the hiney crack 

I do much work, on heavy stomachs like Levert 

Put up some money, I bet my tools'll make your rectum hurt 

Black exposed em, for you don't want to mess with me 

I seek in your girl's box, and cover your publicity 

Sequence first, and drop the facts on DAT 



Chorus",Wild and Crazy,1996
Dr. Octagon,"You enter, step in the room, four, five
My over compressed thoughts and ways make you get live
You are the patient, and I, your black doctor,
Medical bills, insurance, cash in the ceiling.
Dioxalyn fingerprints here ever since
I got my white suit pressed, out the cleaners,
X-Ray shades, with hard shoes and some razor  blades
Who's the brother that's sick, and needs the operation?
Bullets removed from your head, grand central station
I gotta cut off  your ear, first behind your neck
Rip out the stomach, and open rectum?s to dissect
Shine the light, inside, roaches crawling in your throat
I have no tools, my hammer?s done, my drill is broked

I'm the doctor,
You wait on the waiting list,
Patients been here since this morning I dismiss.

Watching people vomit green, my po-lig is lizard pills
My office in Berbick, I had the bodies in Beverley Hills.
Seeking Kimbles and bits, a girl with small tits
Talking to herself, her dog, and having rabid fits
Green fly soup in on the way from the kitchen, troop
Looking at T.B tuberculous on the window post
Ten dead dogs, a brown fox in the comatose
With no reps, I put more needles in they kneecaps
Some primitive screws, and my, yes and perhaps 
A little sprinkle of Clorox, in their vocal box 
Some Pepto-Bismol, Pepsi-Cola, pack of Pop Rocks
Mix it all together with bugs, to change the weather,
You be coughing blue, with eyes like Mr. Magoo
Straight up cartoon, you're bound to fall out real soon.

I'm the doctor,
You wait on the waiting list,
Patients been here since this morning I dismiss.

As you come in the bright, you ride the orange ambulance
Look at widows and pell see the mental patients dance
Doin' six and seven, steps ladies yells dance
Upside downside with walls flyin' through the hall
Mr. Reeves/Mysteries with yellow bees they fly, sting your face
You out there bumps, caught up with a acne case
Plastic surgery, your lawyer now refer to me
Giving you sketches, exquisite pictures of the gill man
What's the matter, are you happy? Na you're ill man
Standin' back, you choose a ticket,
My spiritual laws of vitamins will turn your face wicked
You're invited to ride the glide to your homicide
 
I'm the doctor,
You wait on the waiting list,
Patients been here since this morning I dismiss.",Waiting List,1996

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

A rainy night in Georgia

I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

Lucifer:
Oh angel o' my winter;
Grieveth for the pain o' sadness.
A gothic embrace restores my love
God took away...
Ye romance o' forgotten times...
In eras without the sun.
An ocean o' tears I see...
A nightfall o' dreams caresses me.


Deliah:
Thou wert, thou art, thou shalt fore'er be...
Ye nightshade o' thy sorrow,
Stretching out for it's romantic rose in twilights beauty.
In love with ye thousands o' nights...
But weeping in silence... in ebony... for melancholyâ?¦ forever!


Jesus Christ walks the Earthâ?¦
A pitiful shade of Godâ?¦
A cruel conspiracy for the sake of slavery,
And He drags 'em down to the plague of humanity.


Lucifer:
I've killed my holinessâ?¦
Killed my emptiness!
I'm fallen from Godâ?¦
Fallen from guilt!


I've abandoned the light,
The light that blinded so long!
Free from submission,
But still under His spell.
We're in painâ?¦ painâ?¦ pain!
Sorrow turns to anguishâ?¦
And I scream with hate at the tyrant above!


Deliah:
Hosanna de Profundis!
Dethrone the tyrantâ?¦
Take his throne, take the throne!


Astaroth:
Gothic moonâ?¦ ablazeth the eventide so sonorous,
Ye solemn of a lovelorn gard'n o' crimson souls.
All true beauty is sad...
But lost within the clenched hands of God.


Lucifer:
I mourn that the night passes us byâ?¦
Let there be an eternal nightâ?¦ eternal night!
I mourn that the night passes us by!
Let there be an eternal nightâ?¦ eternal night!


..I shall call upon the dragon...!




",The Gothic Embrace,2006
Draconian,"(I am the Light that Leads to Darkness)

""I've cried a river for you to swim
To let you know the state we're in.
I've dreamt a vision for you to see He's dreamt a vision for us to see,
That the night is the only worthy key that night is the worthy keyâ?¦
(and the sound of silent cries
Is heard throughout the skies"".


I have seen Heaven's sleep, We have felt Heaven's sleep,
And I've watched the angels weep, our God hath made us weep
They are slaves of fear and pain
(that is ruled by a god insane).
I know that the night will save us all O Lucifer, O Morningstarâ?¦
As long we praise the dragons call. how we praise your ancient fallâ?¦


Eternal seems the time,
But the only true love will remain,
And darkness shall rise up to Heaven
To embrace the last, final prayer...
Cause the grace of His word once spoken
Is now shattered by a promise broken.


""So curse the tyrant, curse the light,
For we are free here in the (endless) night. How free we could be in the nightâ?¦
So embrace the sorrow, kiss the tearsâ?¦
Follow the wind to erase your fears, Follow the wind, follow the signâ?¦
For the fires burn bright, the fires of blue,
And in the end it will burn in all of you.""


The war will come,
Apocalyptic storms of a tortured silence
As God oppresses His last, final soulâ?¦
And eternal seems the time,
But the only true love will remain,
And darkness shall rise up to Heaven
To embrace the last, final prayerâ?¦
So deny God's light and His words spokenâ?¦
We regain Heaven and crush His skull wide open!


""I've cried a river for you to swim,
To let you know the state we're in.
I've sent a message throughout the stars, He's sent a message throughout the stars,
For His kingdom is full of scars. God's kingdom is full of scars.
I am Lucifer, the angel of light He is Lucifer, O Luciferâ?¦
Come with me and love the night!


And legions of angels out from Heav'n flyâ?¦
Oh, how they soar above the mountains high!

I am the Nightâ?¦
Behold Pandemonium!"" Behold Pandemonium

Lucifer:
And the fires burn'd inside my eye's
As ye fall's ascending like a moment o' joy. Spirit of Night:
My thorns where sown in ye light o' Day, His thorns were spawned from the grasp o' God,
And the windsâ?¦ they blewâ?¦ and the painâ?¦ it grewâ?¦
Until my winds, they blew no more. but holiness grew no more.
I scream'd out into the dawn!


Grievance; fro' the horizon she comesâ?¦
I wonder if I could stay in His world, Grievance:
'cause sooner or later this pain must end! Pain must end!
My lifeâ?¦ it cries to be free, His life cries, but soon to be freeâ?¦
But legions of starsâ?¦ the stars suffers with me! Thou art the star o' Venusâ?¦ Oh Seraphim!


The Holy Spirit:
Thou must obey thy father, thy God!
Bow down before his eyesâ?¦ before his very eye'sâ?¦!

My Godâ?¦ 'father'â?¦ hear us cry!
Tell me whyâ?¦! Thou wilt die!!!

Oh, Enslaver of Souls;
Thou can not be our father!
Oh, Avengeful God;
Thou hast brought us agony!


Lucifer:
Into heav'n our sorrowâ?¦ Sorrow
Ye beautiful moment o' tragedyâ?¦ so beautifulâ?¦
Falling fro' the lies of His 'perfect world'. They are fallingâ?¦
Takest us away, so far awayâ?¦ falling!
Here is nothing but pain. God is smilingâ?¦
Farewell now as we enter our darknessâ?¦ smiling!
And we love her, the realization! Salvation comes but pain
Behold our salvation!



",Serenade of Sorrow,2006
Draconian,"The cold winds blew into life, my adored. 
A bleeding heart we share, now on Azrael?s wings. 

I fall like autumn rain? 
You are my everything. 

This lovelorn kiss of death in lugubrious silence? 
Dawn breaks open like a wound? and the dreadful sun 

Two souls entwined together, 
Still so alone. 
Both you and I are shattered 
And frozen in stone. 

You begged for air from within this cold tomb 
With pain sharp as a knife. 
I now lie resting like a child on thy womb, 
Gave back a part of my life. 

For a while it had disappeared, but nothing was changed. 
A haze fell forever with her fading life. 
I leaned my head back? then drank of opaline. 
The emerald goddess came to me? she craved my soul. 
And just for a while? I had forgotten. 

Yes, it was all forgotten, but nothing was changed. 
Suddenly a cold breeze blew across our room? 
It felt like I wanted to leave? this world with her. 

Come; drink with me the divine nectar of Olympus! 
Sit beside me and help defy our adversity and loss? 
This adversity and loss. It all ends with you! 

I kiss you in your dying breath; sleeping quietly now. 
Swept away by heavy eyelids; forever in my dreams? 
And you will be safe in my dearest dreams? 
My love? forever in my dearest dreams.

Begging for mercy in their one final plea
Soldiers prepare to fight to the death
Fighting and killing to their very last breath

Born with the power of God in his hand

Turning all hopes of life to sand

Hiding in darkness from enemies unseen
Awaiting our victory ending his dream
Cursed are the souls who defy his will
All of which are tortured and ruthlessly killed

Born with the power of God in his hand
Shocking the world with his mass devastation
He puts all his power in the trust of one nation

Hunting, fighting and killing all men

Seeking out goals that can't be conceived

I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like mama's homemade dress
Papa's bank book wasn't big enough
Me I'm standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on my shoes
I'm heading out to the east coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue

she was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam I guess
But I used a little too much force
And we drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out west
We split up on a sad dark night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around and looked at me
As I was walking away
Then I heard her say over my shoulder
We'll meet again someday
On the avenue
Tangled up in blue

I was living in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
I never did like it all that much
And one day the axe just fell
So I drifted down to new orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Yeah I was working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of de la croix
And all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I'd seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue

she was working at a topless bar
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear
Now later on as the crowd thinned out
And I was just about to do the same
Yeah but she was standing there at the back of my chair
She said don't I know your name
Well I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoes
We were tangled up in blue
I know I know I know

she lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
I thought you'd never say hello she said
You look like the silent type
And then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an italian poet
From the 13th century
Every one of his words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off every page
Like it was written in my soul
From me to you
Tangled up in blue
Yeah yeah

I lived with them on montague street
In a basement down the stairs yeah
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
That's when he started into dealing with slaves yeah
Something inside of her died just died
And she had to sell everything she owned
And she froze up inside
Finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue
Oh yeah

now I'm headed back again
I gotta get to her somehow
And all the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
I don't know how they all got started
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me I'm still on the road
Headed for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point
Of view

You been kept waiting, you I've been hating
Losing you all of the while

All of my friends have gone south
I'm getting over it now
Talking with them doesn't count

Get out your seats, and put your drinks down
What we gon do, is party right now
Get out your seats, and put your drinks down

[Verse One]
I ain't gonna front, drag drunk as a muh fucka
A wifey my chick, as long as my moms love her
And get the okay from grandma
She told me what my grandpa used for stamina
And I ain't wit that sittin' around shit
That dicks 'em down quick, then kicks 'em out bitch!
I treats a chick like a basketball playa
I shoot my game she bounce wit me then we lay up
Now that's a foul playa
Ya girl could be sweeter than candy, so I can get her now or lata
I guess I just wait, I came in the club late
But I'm leavin' the place early wit a pretty face, small waste
Necks thick like ?? chicken
I go up in the ladies store, purchase woman
Like, did y'all forget the face
I'm like throwbacks in the summer, I'm all over the place

[Verse Two]
I had shorty hands up, but her pants ain't off
Smokin the herb from Canada, her man is gone
(Gone?) yes that nigga better go
'cause if I ?? half of my shirt, half of my metal show
And this is just the beginning
I done had more woman then, ralph lauren stiches name in denim
I had more chicks wet, than a titanic collision
Then left 'em in the cold, just like that ??? em
So ma you make the decision
'cause I ain't got a lot of time, 'cause this ain't prison
I'll give ya long kiss goodnight, like samuel
And keep a guard wit ya that shoot, like sam cassell

Laid up with ten, cause when I pull it out
I pull in shouts like blow!
Damn that shit was loud! See the crowd?
They all seek cover when they see that black rubber
Because this cat here, got no sisters or no brothers
It was one alone
Covered with shellack ready to die black
Lets talk about guns, and how y'all don't bust none
These niggas here, y'all doing lest busting lot of ducking
Maybe a lot of fucking, cause all y'all bust is nuts

Let him think there's peace
And give him something to remember

Sneakers off, closed casket, blew his cheek off
By the way be careful who you speak of
'Cause I by the wall in the back, guaranteed and all that

When I leave the place, drop the reef, in his moms lap
Motherfuckers soon as y'all think your beef is sweet
I'm gonna lay in the streets 
And let y'all niggaz throw quarters on me
Can you spare change for your life?
Change for what? that's when I pop up

How we sound with it?
Don't forget, we bust rhymes for it
Skip town for it, get under the ground for it
So nigga, don't ignore it
Unless your ass is deaf
This is gonna be your last breath
Your last S. and S. check
With your hands crossed over your chest
I don't give a fuck
What ever I gotta take care, I get it done
If its money, I owe nobody
Except a few hot ones
And if your eighteen and under, this here's your last test
And I'm gonna teach you in the class 
With the past tense, lil bastards
See is for class or for casket. So get your books up
And if your doe is low, that see better mean for Cook Up
Don't tell me that you shook up
You know I keep my stacks tall
So that you gotta look up, and maybe we can hook up
But you know what? Then you woke up
Some body smoked you smoke up
You know what that mean
You broke, and you 'bout to get broke up

And this thing right here.. (Ruff Ryders)
will get your ass off your feet (Remix! .. c'mon)

They call me Drag-On, when it's time to bomb
I burn em all, til they all say turn em off
Cause these chips, I'ma run em all
Chickenheads, know I, be the Colonel
Cause I burn eternal, mixed wit the inferno
So be careful, 'fore I burn you
You better learn dude, yeah I heard you 
but I'ma hurt you, but you don't know?
My versatile, is a virtue
Ruff Ryders be the team, which means
a lot cream, lot of schemes 
Lot of beams to make your stock drop, right on the seams
Nigga here is too hot and too much for you to touch
Better tell your man cause I'm too tough 
Indubitably, too dust
Do you bust?  Cause we do
You need to ask the people, but quietly
But they don't believe until they leave violently 
Is you buying this?
Cause niggaz that purchased is under the dirt kid
They call me Drag-On; I'm the youngest but get bonkers
Collabo' wit my dogs from Yonkers
but this Bronx bomber's spittin flame
so you better wear your armor
Flame on!

My dogs gon' STOP, your dogs gon' DROP
And then we gon' SHUT EM DOWN, OPEN UP SHOP
First we had em like OHHH, now they like NOOO
What baby?!!  THAT'S HOW RUFF RYDERS ROLL

And then we gon' SHUT EM DOWN, OPEN UP SHOP
First we had em like OHHH, now they like NOOO
What baby?!!  THAT'S HOW RUFF RYDERS ROLL

When I pop up, I lock shop up, pull the drop up 
Park a block up, hit the alarm, put the top up
Stash the 'dro in my sock then pull my sock up
And keep the burner but if it's hot put my glock up 
You know what I'm about, slidin off get my cock sucked
Or writin rhymes watching Scarface in the hot tub
Whatchu wanna bet, when I pull it out
if you don't shout that every bullet'll go in and out
Who you know besides 'Kiss take the piss in the bottle of Crist'
and then give it to a modelin bitch 
And you like your watch plain, I'ma flood mine
Alligator bloodline trained to find coke and bite one time

Y'all niggaz ain't hearin me out, til I pop up 
appear in your house, clearin it out, holiday style
Everybody actin violent and wild 
Snatch the wife silence the child, that's how we move
Kill me my man kill you, that's how you lose
I Ruff Ryde, I don't like to slide felt that I slipped
Then the gun's only helpin the clip
And the clip's only helpin my hand
And like who the fuck is helpin your man?
When I cock back and hop out the van 
Double R, get a job, play the shit in the car
Hit a party start a fight at the bar, and snatch your R
Sell your shit for some coke and get the fuck out of Dodge

Guess you figured that my niggaz, flippers, pullin triggers

Bitch, I get you shot in the head or shot in the neck 
If I ain't gettin' proper respect 
I don't care if you rap, I still spit in your grill 
I don't give a fuck, never have, never will 
If it ain't on your hip, then you're lookin' to die 
I ain't tryin' to be the nigga that's gonna look at the sky 
Ask God why I'm broke, bitch, I'm cooking the pie 
We all gon' die, sooner or later, matter of time 
My niggas sell crack, with a package of dimes 
Hundred or more, in front of the store, waitin' to bubble 
Brand new nine, and an eight in a bubble 
I put sixteen above ya neck, I love my set 
Niggas think they a thug, then thug to death (uh-huh)

I say what I want, fuck what y'all think is cool 
And I hate cops, 'cause most y'all was dicks in school 
No pussy gettin' niggas tryin' to cuff the God 
Play Sheek out in the yard, but that shit too hard 
My dough too long, nowadays, my flow too strong 
What y'all make in a year, I kick that for a song 
Check my car, I don't care, I don't play fair 
Keep some shit in the stash box, then get me the chair 
And it don't buck shot and the blast is hard to hear 
I'm a true thug nigga, bring it straight to your crew 
Small yell when I rap, I'm basically talkin' to you 
You see the pain in my eye? Nigga, the flame in my eye? 
I'm tryin to leave my kids some real fuckin change when I die 
From rappin' or tellin' some cat to reach for the sky 
I'm that hunt down nigga, with the four pound nigga 
Bounty hunt your whole crew 'til my bullets go through, what? 

All I need is a big gun and a coupe that's crazy quick 
A nice house with five rooms, maybe six 
A town where money is coming, eighty bricks 
Break 'em down to all twenties, is a crazy flip 
Bet you never even felt the heat 
'Til I put the M1 next to your waves and melt the grease 
Streets help niggas, niggas don't help the streets 
Y'all use beats for help, we help the beats 
Who want it with me? Who want it with Sheek? Who want it with P? 
If I say so myself, it's a wonderful three 
Be in the hood with all your jewels in the glovebox 
Same niggas that'll rob you love L.O.X. (Uh) 
All types of burners, even snub Glocks (uh) 
Nice size TECs you could carry in your sweats (uh) 
Find your man dead in the trunk of the car (uh) 
It's Jada (mwwaa) responsible for breakin' your heart (uh) 

Creep through the streets 
For some of y'all rappers, that's mighty hard 
Me the security? Protectin' my body? I let my shotty guard 
Put chill pills in brains, bullets like Tylenol 
Make niggas drowsy from the blood loss, got 'em noddin' off 
And take casket naps, fuck that 
You shoulda never let this bastard rap 
All I know is cold winter, hot slugs through your snorkel 
No parents, tale from my horror's no morals 
Raised in the wrong era, with no guidance 
So you dyin'? It's no problem, no lyin '
Drag's fire, so ya hamburger beef? I french-fry 'em 
Drag done ate your food 
Like I know to raise your dukes so guard your chin up 
Drag barrels, but shit, I spit-bubble your skin up 
Drag scorch niggas for dinner but season 'em well 
I don't brag I let the streets tell 
Po'-po' now you see he fell 

And you motherfuckers know what my name means when you hear it in the streets (uh) 
Y'all bitches fear it 'cause you weak 
You want to hear it? I make it speak (What?) 
You ain't ever bust a gun, but there's a lot of greasy talkin' (uh-huh) 
What the science behind that son? (I don't know) 
A lot of easy walkin'
I bust shit down (uh) got down (uh) kick down (uh) shot down (uh) 
Ain't tryin' to talk about what I got now, but I got now (What?) 
I ain't never sold a brick, I done stuck niggas up (c'mon) 
And for talkin too much shit? I done fucked niggas up (uh) 
It can get ""Dark"" for real, and I think you already know that (uh-huh) 
Well think about it with the brick in your hand before you throw that 
Now don't act, 'cause actin' might get you rollin '
If you ain't ready to handle (Uhh) 
All that's left of your memory, is a candle (Woo!)

Hitting wit the hardest shit, 'cause 'fore we started shit 
Wit kids I knew my friends all turned against me 
Said fuck it, bought me a dog ever since me and my dog has been like this 
He got my back I got his, scheming on mad niggas 
That's how we do biz
It's about time to start another, robbing spree 
'Cause yo, my way is highway, robbery, chump 
When I was up north, since 16 I was sending niggas home in a coffin 
Living like a orphan, you bad nigga? 
I'll be back to see if you'll be still here 
You know my style I'll put yo fucking man, in a wheelchair 
He'll never walk again, on the strength of me 
That's how I left him G, scared to death of me 
Cannot run, hit wit the hot one 
From the shotgun, cats was close, wondered how we got done 

E-V-E 
My dogs believe in me 
Petty thugs hide yo cake, never teasing me 
I show love to, all my bitches hustling one's, tussle wit thieves 
Making moves, second to none, I locked it, uh 
Made a sudden move you got bit 
Flooded wit the double R, real street shit 
The blonde hair bandit, you got guns, hand it 
Turn my face when I bust a cannon 
'Cause I don't wear sunblock 
Ask Drag if the fire is hot 
Click pop shells, fall three feet, roll over and stop 
Believe in this gang, we beat y'all, you got money? 
Keep y'alls, for us be tearing trying to i-dentify big dogs

And you can come see me if you trying to make a grand tonight 
'Cause I can get it for you raw, gray, tan or white 
I hate rap yo, I'd rather be planning a flight 
Somewhere hot on a Wave Runner, tanning wit dikes 
Blowing the haze, while all of 'em giving me brains 
One at a time, y'all start from the front of the line 
And as for you playboy you can keep those raps
And keep your awards, my son can't eat those plaques 
Drove the Benz off the lot and just dusted her off 
Tints, rims, stashed, took the governor off 
Even the cats that be hating still be loving the dogs 
'Cause they know that the double R's coming for war 
What

If you ain't ready to die, then why should you live? 
'Cause when I start swingin' the thing you hiding the kids 
And the P is still riding on trips, surviving the strip 
Beefing on the 4th you got to fly on the 5th 
Like I wasn't hustling hope or runnin' the block
Starving or not, carving the cheek, palming the Glock 
Figure which nigga could I watch wit a watch 
I like to knock off my work then I pull off a heist 
Put it together, double it twice, rider for life 
Catch me wit a 45, hot pair of Nikes 
And three red dice, like, give me the bank or gimmie yo face 
Gimmie a shank, it's Holiday  

Y'all dem bust in them crowd cats and hit whoever 
When you should aim for them cats that took yo leather 
They right there, but you scared that they gon' bust

Y'all dogs might be crazy, but y'all not stupid 
Y'all I got call cops squeelers, I got autops killas, that'll bust you and slide

Boy, whats the difference between fire and water? 
You whether drown or die off torture, 'cause yo skins of ya 
And watch ya burn off fat, dog I'm off the thermostat 
Could put a comb to my mouth and give yo chick a perm wit that 
Keep shells in the envelopes 'cause I'll mail out bullets 
More blood than a riot on a jailhouse footage 
Buck 40, buy the extra 20 wit the semi, when it hit you 
You gon' do a 360 pretty swiftly

I don't care if its automatic or semi
If I payed 300 flat, that means I'mma send a hundred cats back
If 300 attack, but it don't hafta be an exact
I'm gonna get the gatts and get 'em all in one house, and run out
And sprinkle some on the grass, and spit on it
And come back to a pile of ash

I have been a hundred places and nothin' excites me
Hit a hundred hoe's and none of them wifey
For every thousand that love me

Strike a match and burn the fucking scene 

I'm no joker - I could blow you in the smoke 

and make your man a second hand smoker. 

I'm so vulgar - I'm sendin' niggas straight back to their maker

Make a nigga yell for crew quick 

A true bitch, eat a nigga up like a chew-stick 

Too rich, is what I plan to be in the 9-9

I'm bomb, see I'm dope like heroin 

And my guns got scopes, so they zero in 

From here on in, know I fear no men 

And mutherfuck shootin' five, here go ten

You tough? Fight death and be a hero then

But you're a slave, and yo, you can't come up in a heat tank

Who made me burn all of my numbers to bitches, you do
Who made me turn in early leave on my niggas, you do
Who do all the cooking at night in the kitchen, you do 
Whoever say pussy don't talk to me, who do
I love these hoes, yeah I love these hoes
They make me do the things that I don't want to
You know let's go

I need a chick that when the drain clog, call me for plumbin
Call my name when she cumming, feel my tip, touch tummies
Split dutch, dump twenties
Pat my back when I choke
Don't ask for no totes til I say ""Oh you smoke?""
I need a chick that gon drag for Drag
I mean she ain't gotta be smart in math
And see my stacks starting to add
I went from jumping cabs, to rotting with my niggas
And hoop rags, to the Jags, no top, all glass
And y'all chicks with long hair, take a seat right here
So I can blow this wind through it and let my niggas see
It's all here
Pay for no hotels, I'm nothing in the same chair
Front or the rear or while I'm clutching the gears
I leave a chick sprung, I stop fucking wit her
She act like it ain't nothing to her it ain't nothing to me
Long as I don't leave a nut in her
Used to be rebelling til she heard on Hot 97
Point uno but I still fuck wit you

I spent a lot of money on this mattress
So I can't stand a chick that give me wack sex
I just tell em they better go home and practice
'cause if you fronting well you one hell of an actress
Tackle it, c'mon jump on it, throw your back in it
Let me know it's deep enough for me to stash cracks in it
And be realer she can beep when she come near me
Keep the gun by me, don't let bullshit run by me
And to my mamis, I speaks ""Ven aqui"" they come running like
Right now I don't care if they in they car they running lights
Intellectual type, more freaky than a hundred dikes
Armin her dogs but she got me like I don't want to bite
I don't feel like going to the studio I don't want to write
Don't want to fight, don't want to fuck nobody else wife
No fronting boo for real all I really want is you
But you make me do things that I don't want to do

Look at shorty with them things on, making me feel like King Kong
That's why I keep a monkey on my arm when I'm playing Donkey Kong
Petiteness, I love Victoria, but ain't no secret
It don't take a man that's strong to move over them thongs
Better yet, I'll even put it on, let me take care of this
When I'm eatin chick, I eatin like wear this
I love chicks with they braids pushed back
That look like four racetracks, now chase that
'cause everybody wantin mine, taste of her tongue's like Duncan Hines
Can't stand another brother humpin mine only we can bump and grind
I don't care who was there before I laid there
For now I play here, and if she want me too I shave there
I'ma be around until there's gray hair, okay dear
And I'ma get you these books from Barnes and Noble's wait here
Then we can split shares
Computers and street smarts, mine sharp as a dart

Cross the throat, couldn't say you gave her mouth to mouth

Right in front of her child, with no feel for the kid
Gon kill that bitch

Other niggas use the fire when they lightin they spliff
I want my tires on fire when I'm pushin a whip
I put my block on fire with the product I sell
It's the Opposite of H2O, hotter than hell

Choke, hydro til it's time to go
Cheeba my smoke, I plays ping pong
If why'all hooked on phonics, that mean here's ten buy your own chronic
We buy cars, 4, dot after it, get gas in it
Go fasten it, then crash in it

Burnin up and make em..., sorry officers I only got my permit
To the fake cats, who shank niggas, break bats
Stay 'woke, 'cause make hats, take naps
Put him to sleep faster than a needle
I come with four niggas stuffed in the beetle
With some bats and beat you
You a bad bitch I had to meet you, had to pop it
Bounce, before I fuck broads I unlock it
And back to the block to check the spot quick
We snatch niggas reups and hit em for they bodies
Tell em keep the profits

Yo, first it's Drag, dash, On
Then it's the cash, fuck it all I've been in cabs

With the crackers, tell em pack it, out they pockets
Hurry up, all this walkin around I'm gonna stop it
This gun I'm gonna pop it
'Cause at this time 12 pm my gun is all you might be seein
If you sight seein
You might be in, a hearse, then casket, then church
Then you aten(eaten) by the maggots
Fuck you hatin bastards
It's over for why'all niggas once Drag take his mask then
Why'all know it's straight platinum
Earth, wind, water, the 4th yo, is the Opposite of H2O
That's one of the elements I use to melt the mic
Ryde or Die, well we gon Ruff Ryde and keep the family tight

[Chorus]",Opposite of H2o,2000
Drag-On,"[Drag-On]
We the niggas that y'all niggas wish y'all can blaze that
We put niggas where they can't get their days back
So gone brush your hair nigga, we knock off wave caps
And have niggas like pat can't say jack
When the last time you seen one of us run?
Without bussin our guns
Getting the job done
Cause we the niggas they send,
When you over spend
Like if your money ain't right we take your chil-dren
I tell you what, I ain't gonna take side deals, for real
If you bail
I promise I won't know when they kill
They keep him out of sight
Love wouldn't hit him right
Couldn't snipe plus his kid was on him too tight
But for his family that's an extra 10 thou
Give me another night out
And they'll be all wiped out
This is for the cause
Every man is his own walls
No remorse
Money missing that's his own loss
Come On

[Chorus: x2]
Snipe out, snipe out, snipe out (and if the money is right)
Snipe out, snipe out, snipe out, snipe out, snipe out (and the time is right)
Snipe out, snipe out, snipe out, snipe out, snipe out
(and if the place is right, we gonna get it) Snipe out, snipe out

[Drag-On]
I told niggas have that cash right
Won't have to worry about Drag at night
But its niggas like you that make me creep through light
There he go right there
I think I got these shots for him
He couldn't hear shit but these dots on his head
Caught him while he's snoring right next to his hoe
I guess he gonna breathe better with them extra holes
I'ma sick nigga I stayed till the bitch woke up
For free
I just wanted to hear the hoe scream
That's my pleasure
Ding dong (Door Bell)
Who that?
Room service
Ran to the peep hole
A lil nervous
Then I broke down 20 yards 32
Then he looked at the box and I told him those are 2's
I ain't want to pop this nigga so I played it cool
Lift them up and down showie rum just a fool
Cause he could of brung the police to get me
Or even worse, somebody sent him to hit me

[Chorus: x2]

[Drag-On]
And this nigga they want me to kill
Is worth ninety bill
So I raised the stakes, this job cost a mill
This ain't gonna be no quick shit
Cause they want the chip
So I dip quick stop
Pull out the lab top
Tapped in the Window's software 
You know one of biz
Then I put a few of my codes in front of his
Tell em to load the stuff now
System shut down
Snipe a few guards, dead before they hit the ground
Soon as I got to the door to pop the lock up
My vest got popped up
I dropped then got up
One of the guards that's I hit up I picked up
Put his face to the camera for a picture
Soon as they brunged him in
I put another slug to him
That put the blood on him
Took the chip
Blugged him
Yo my vest was full of bullets to I tore it off
Never thought somebody was behind me saw him off

A-yo I spit these bars to make ya head shake
Fuck bitches 'til the bed break
Let's see how much lead you can take
Never let a nigga pay for what I give away
We can all share
Clip to my waist it's all spare
So run dammit, run 
When I bust my gun
I miss none
Put y'all in critical condition
I'm the talk of the town when it comes to fuckin' bitches
Or layin' niggas down
Drag bust the most rounds
While y'all niggas dibble and dabble
The shit I pull up wit
It'll feel like it grabs you
We ain't fuckin' I had you
Shit I know Drag'll be glad to
If I had to
Soon as she in the bathroom
I'm in her ass too
Gotta six shot shooter
That'll pop through ya
Glock ruger
In case I call my block movers
State troopers on my ass
Shit let me see them touch 160 on the dash
My Z look pretty when it's fast
I bet 50 I'ma juice the city before I pass
And if you want to catch fire better step on the gas
The opposite of H2O
Want to be a hero
When the fires on
Y'all won't even see ya moms
Even if she was screamin' at the top of her lungs
Niggas either burn to the bone or leave the shit alone
In case of a fire never take the elevator
Walk 2 flights hold ya breath and take the steps (Uhh)

[Chorus: Swizz Beats]
Do my ladies run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
Do my ballers run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
Do my mamis run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
Do my dogs run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh

[Drag-On]
A-yo I only fuck bitches that's flexible
Ankle touch neck sex incredible
When Drag about to spark cats
Ain't no barging wit that
When my gun spit it say ""Where The Target At?""
'cause I'm fire so I speaks wit heat
So let me walk that walk
'cause like a teacher I'ma talk wit chalk
That'll outline y'all like a fresh pair of Nikes
Stay wit those 
Even if I'm bare toed you see the stripe
I leave blood stains on sponges
Cum stains on comforters
I leave rooms foggy
'Til where y'all can't find me
Keep a bad mami
Twisting up the green scent
Like tangerine face out of a magazine
Like ebony
On the block I pump the ivory
Never pay for show
I only fuck wit those that never ate before
That means no food, no cars and just skip bail
The only thing on they plate is no more than fish scale
The blow you only know about is the air outside
I have nightmares before I sleep I pray y'all fry
For a pie I lay out guys
'cause what I keeps layin' on my dresser
Keeps layin' niggas on top of stretchers
Lightweight but I give off pressure in all measures
Never chase treasures
Flame niggas for pleasure
Red/Gold vest
Bullets go through tef
Got better double are

Drag-On,"[Verse 1]
Listen up, yo, shit I get upset if I see a nigga, layin' in his sweats
With blood comin' out his head like sweat, knowin' I could be next
So, what about all the babies that ain't fully born
That's less fortunate, like that man walkin' with one arm

They tried to throw me up in a orphanage, with all the kids
But I stayed up in the offices 'cause they couldn't get me, off a kid
It's sad when a good mother put hard work
Like wash clothes, off the shit we played on and got hurt

Why she gotta pay for the dirt
'Cause her only son is up the street with the whole block sour
'Cause you know bodies lay for 'bout for eight hours
Want to talk about our chrome whips

There's niggas out there don't own shit
While we sit at home and bone a bitch while niggas is homeless
See niggas get piped over dice, wiped out, over 4 digit price
Damn near broke my heart, made me so sick, I had to go shit

Found her up the steps a bloody mess, hopeless
It wasn't cops 'cause only street niggas empty the whole clip
Ya know this

[Chorus: x2] 
People come, people go, that's the way life is
(and I heard that)
I don't know what to do, guess I'll just handle it
(and we heard that)

[Verse 2]
Yo bullets don't have no name
Or maybe y'all niggas should get better aim
And stop puttin' these innocent people in pain
It's a damn shame that life ain't, nothin' but a game

And we all at the 4th quarter, 'cause our time is shorter and shorter
'Cause y'all got time to tap our phones and hear the orders
And stop the coke from comin' across the waters
But y'all can't stop the slaughters

Or the people from starvin'
The guns is not standin' still, they still revolvin'
Uptight and still mobbin'
Blacks still sling cracks and know I know why they call it

Fishscale, from Colombia to New York on a boat the shit sells
Tell a weak whore, and when I score
I'm a open up my door and give to the poor
Til they tell me they don't even want no more

Y'all keep raisin the rent, then tell us how to raise our kids
And categorize us on, where we live like by on Broadway
It's all Dominicans and blacks that's packed in projects serious
And why Y'all call it a project, are we an experiment?

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3]
Yo, I wasn't tryin to be a slave
Or encaged up with braids
I was saved by a guy with a older age with grades
Told me the other ways to get paid, than lettin my gun wave

We know you brave, get yo' shit tight and here's a pen
It's much lighter, like click click, that's a gun sound
Blau! That's a round now hit the ground
That's what Drag learns 'cause his pop's back was turned

Now call the cops, what about that gat that just got pungin'
Or that kid that got it 41 times, you call that justice?
If it is, then what the fuck is this
Somethin' I must have just missed

Maybe Christmas and get a nut off, we get our hot water cut off
Off my Timbs I wipe the mud off, 'cause I put the stomp in it
Pretty rivers, and lakes and ponds, Drag was in a swamp in Bronx
Well death is where I could of gone

'Cause where I'm from the bullets long
Y'all see the news, but why my block gang got no footage on
'Cause my life is like a movie, when you die, ain't no comin' back shit
So if one of y'all get shot, nigga handle it

Its about Drag copping the bank or copping the Range
Laid up some where I ain't gotta be poppin them thangs
'cause I already got the cash
So who would ever think you'll see Drag without his mask
Waiting for a vic to past
Its about Drag off the strip out the orphanage
Of course this is same kid
Coughing off the nics
What you see something different
All I keeps different is my woman no kids so a nigga chilling
Stay peeling, what are you kidding money stacked to the ceiling
Chicks wit a frown see my rims spinning grinning
Fiends on the block
Still see my cane'll cop
Cause traffic on the block
Red, yellow, green top
While I'm bumping at the light in a mean drop
Turn it down cops coming burn the rubber now
Grimy nigga just want to see the better thang
See what this cheddar bring
And listen to my niggas sing

What bus to split 
While y'all worry who whips the sick
Shit, I'm a trump type
Gimme a Denali and I'm happy
Wit something sitting in the seat sassy
And for me wouldn't mind getting her knees ashy
And for beef first on to get the heat to pass me
And its not about you acting like you God
'cause I find that mighty hard
If you walking wit a bodyguard
Y'all cats is like ice when y'all stepping out ya Rols
Y'all see me in my over dressed clothes its like y'all froze
Listen, I swear I won't take the white gold
Strictly platinum, I mean that's what y'all said was happening
Like when y'all talk about ya Rolie
And how its shining
But when Drag get it consider it bad timing
This is Drag rhyming, okay
I only paid attention to what Big said
For now its what my nigs say

[Chorus]

Its about Ruff Ryders staying number one in the charts
We don't pop much Crys but we pop a lotta clips
We gone stay street that's where gotta eat
Y'all see us thirty deep motorcycles murda weeks
We make throttle sounds till they track us down
Than pop wheelies till our back touch ground
People on the side say ""here go the action now""
What you talking bout we don't do no crashing now
We be in and out catch you back at the spot
Tank top, bike hop, bank stop
Block hot still got knock from last week shots
But y'all know Drag never cry to the cops
That just give fiends time to detox
Long as I got air in my lungs I'm a blow out my ops
I'm a Ruff Ryde till enough fry
I'm stronger than mudslides
I'm fire, so can't nobody touch I

Moves is made, n****s is paid - that's just how it is
When my time is up, I'm a be out, but I'm a try to live
I'm eatin' day by day; ain't nothin' sweet about it
Act like you don't know what I'm sayin' then you read about it
Built for war like a armadillo
Smokin' yo' a**; put two through the pillow
Hear my s*** through windows
Manic depressive, and my head hurts
Soon as the dead thirst, I'll wet him first
Now wait a minute; it gets worse
I can't control what I own inside
So I take it out on the soul of that kid that died
Spit fire, cross n****s like barbecues
Mobbin' crews, strippin' n****s, robbin' crews
And put him speechless when I made him eat this
Hollow tip, and you can follow grip
You be like Kim and ain't gon' swallow s***
Don't know the half, couldn't know the math
To understand the wrath of a man split in half
But he got what he wanted; shot for three hundred
S*** is tight, and a n**** that's right gots to run it
Ain't no question; that's how I get down
N****s know gimme yo' dough and yo' ho, and, here, take these fo'
Hot things; I got things that make n****s spin
Put n****s in the wind where you never see n****s again
Bless a n**** with fifties - the thin types
And a straight blast that'll put pinstripes across your windpipe

Drag opposite water more than a spot order

Takes more than a pump to out this little punk

And put in they mouth, and catch freeze; tell 'em throw Drag some keys

If you nervous, you don't deserve it poppi, please
Cats stealin' gats; y'all probably will get hit
Well, I'm the future; let's see y'all copy this, stopping this
Since a tiny kid like, ""mommy, buy me this.""
Since she always told me no, started stealin' on some grimy s***
Like look at that, now look at that slide - it in my book bag
I'm who parents point they fingers at, ""get from that hood rat.""
And put it back; f*** tough while y'all cook crack
I'm cocaine; throw me in the pot, I rise to the top
With your 5.0, go 'head, look ma, I got four more pegs
Still put them holes in yo' head, till it's mushy like dough bread
'Cause that vest only protects that chest
And if I decide to get ice, don't get to fascinated
Or it's my bullet, your brain, mashed potatoes

Cop that Benz then dip them rims
Wait till money leave then tell her hop right in
See the buggy no tense see something
Beats thumping; pump stuff in the trunk, and
If worse come to worse, I'm gone and for good
So first things first: get my moms out the hood
Front when you see the face, and you see me everyday
That's okay, Drag brought too many bullets anyway
Look y'all the Sunday; that means it's football

Get our blast on and mash on anyone tryin'
Too late, luck turned bad; you left dyin'
And I got no fear; f*** it, don't care
Know my n****s, then you know that we gon' blast in the air
Weak shots, not; change you for block
Stop game; no pain down from the dock
Take out who, invincible crew
Got n****s that don't even hang with us with tattoos
Most influential

Smells like enemy 
Take you out, it's essential

And a fast way to send 'em to ya

(You a half a nigga)
You was never there for me, you know. You know, take care of yours. 
When I get mine, I'ma take care of mine. 
You can believe that, for real.

You know what you did was wrong
But still, life still goes on
You wasn't my daddy, daddy

Let me ask you a question
Even though I was your reflection
You showed this nigga no love, me and you was no connection
You flipped on my moms and she had your ass arrested
But still, when you was there, my eyes was lit up like flourescents
So I read up on my lessons
Now, I'm fed up with your prescense
You yellin', be	's is screamin', ""Man shut up and get the message""
Things I used to do
Which reminded me of you
But I'm gone, and I'm doin' it and I'm doin fine dude
Look at what you did by and started
You had a mind but you was heartless
You shouldn't have spit me out dog, now I'm going to shine regardless
Supposed to leave me high, but I was already above it yo
You hated me to the point I was the way you loved it yo
But fuck it though
I wouldn't care if you kicked the bucket yo
My dick you can suck it yo
But it wasn't for nothin yo
You was here to leave a new chapter, Drag-On baby
Thoughts from now will live on, til I'm dead and gone baby
You was wrong
But now I'm older spittin' the bomb
Gettin' lit on
Just livin off this written from the arm
I was given from the mind since you wasn't there nigga
Can't believe you had me cryin', you wasn't worth a tear nigga
I used to be in the crib, no money, no food, hopin' for you
Now you and yours peepin' at my bocu's
My lyrics, going to haunt you
You feel this one don't you
Why don't you kill me with precaution
You should have just had an abortion, for real

You know what you did was wrong
But still, life still goes on
You wasn't my daddy, daddy

You never taught me the streets,
And didn't know what you mean to me
You wasn't my daddy, daddy

I guess there's ways of life I have yet to learn
Like Drag-On, and how many niggas I have yet to burn
With no rice on the shelf 
That's when I learned life itself
Only Chow, that's why I hit the mic for delf
Fear no one
I was taught to care for no one
Hard-hitter
Little nigga, cause I ain't hittin' no one
All I heard was me tellin' bitches to get in that bed
Gettin' that head
Me and my niggas gettin' that bread
Shit wasn't right because during that I didn't know you
I guess it's true 
Things you don't know, you're gonna go through
On the phone, tellin' my man, ""I'm about to blow dude""
Moms on the other line, saying, ""You about to blow who?""
""Oh, ain't nothin' ma. Yo, I'll call you later"" 
My moms, was zoned out
The days to the froze was blown out 
Cut the stove on the days I was alone in the house
There was a lot of shit missin', talkin' about she loaned it out
It was thug livin', and there was nothing I could do stop it
Shit was hard like a kindergarten kid in college
Started makin' profit, that's how I built my wealth
And what I did, shit ony the fools will quit up on hisself
I didn't know how I did it by myself
Sometimes it drove me to drinkin' so I spit up on myself
And you know what, out of all that, I'm about to blow up
Til I'm six feet, I'ma tear it up from the floor up
Nigga what

You know what you did was wrong
But still, life still goes on
You wasn't my daddy, daddy

You never taught me the streets,
And didn't know what you mean to me
You wasn't my daddy, daddy

But you was wrong

Well, I'm a aim a little higher, like for your neck
I puff lye
I'm a lift blunts till my arm look like Popeye
Till the day is bye bye
Till then, three hundred G fly by, rented
So foggy windows look tinted

My iron press more than clothes
And girls - I love 'em when I meet 'em
Might eat 'em
But when they act up, it's like Turner Tina
Don't me get the burner
Catch me in the low key Pontiac Sun, sippin' Con-gac
Y'all know how that affects blacks
So you know I clash that
No way I'm a blow all these gats and crack stacks
I'm a lil' n**** so you know I run fast
But don't do much of it 
Do a lot of gun busting
'Cause when I let off a clip, I get a kick
Outta seeing n****s run eyes open, hoping they don't trip
Ya hear the echoes blocks away
Type of bricklayers that hear shots today
And give your blocks away
Run up on papi 
Hey, drop the yay
And if he don't stall
This world be popped tomorrow
Drag-On speaks with a stutter, but I rhyme well
So like a dead snitch, it's hard to tell
Dirty, dirty n****s, word
This is to my grimy, grimy n****s, word
This is to my RR n****s, word
Yeah, 'cause we double R n****s, ya heard?

[Chorus x 6]",Niggas Die 4 Me,2000
Drag-On,"Yo, who want it with us? Y'all n****s not f***in' wit' us
Y'all hoppin' nimrods; We holdin' on up under the truck
We caked out; we all got cars so when we wake up in the mornin'
We race out; but first blow the place out
It gets outrageous; to all my thug n****s - throw your sets up
And spit y'all razors
I hop in to spin out; I'm the opposite of H2O
So in the year two thousand, the lights would a never went out
Plus I rock ice, it drips on my boot; I shake it off
'Cause I'm fire, so every few seconds I take it off
I'm lightweight; I let y'all throw them dumbbells
I just throw back them dumb dumb shells to make y'all run well
I shoot dummies, blast backs
Money ga**ed up while I'm a open this tank
Yo, pa** me the shank
I blackout, swipe 'em like a credit card till I max out
And that's just to let y'all know that Drag is back now

[Chorus x 2]
Now all my motherf***in' peoples say yeah, yeah
Now all my motherf***in' thugs say yeah, yeah
Now all my motherf***in' ladies say yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, throw your hands in the air, c'mon

Y'all keep pushin' that whack s*** out there; y'all unable
Drag's like jumper cables, negative and a positive
Y'all ain't gon' feel s*** till y'all get a lot of this
I don't care about y'all hatin' n****s; my moms is part of this
She looks at herself and says I got all this
'Cause I drop them hits that make y'all chumps don't drop s***
Drag straps up when he get up in his women
Put somethin' long in the booty have 'em switchin' different
I snatch n****s wife to show 'em the light
Give 'em dick, then I'm hittin' the switch
And while she snorin', she don't know I'm gone by the mornin'
Back to the corner till that blue van come up; my hands is cuffed, uh
Whose fingers stay numb from rollin' up
Who finger f***s chicks till they throwin' up
Whose fingerprints cops keep showin' up
'Cause who that kid always ride and is throwin' truck

[Chorus x 2]

Yo, yo, I just take a strong pull and strike the match on n****s
I spit lit candles and drop hot wax on n****s
My middle name Jason
That means I'm capable of throwin' a ma** on and axe n****s
Y'all better ask n****s
First name: Mel 
I mean that's what them checks say
When they come in the mail, make bank tellers cum on they self
Count it fast, ma; we all professionals here
How's it feel knowin' I'm walkin' outta here
With what you get in a year?
I'm rude to a b****, but y'all n****s get out the street
Act like you don't see this black jeep, and get some flat feet
Y'all rock gators; we straight problems
We rock our Timbs half O's, laces like our dogs got 'em
F*** it, for two minutes, let 'em play wit' a new pair
I got enough spares to flood the block with footwear
Pockets like a blimp; s***, it's been a good year
Where my Ruff Ryders? 
We still in here

[Chorus x 4]",Pop It,2000
Drag-On,"[Styles Paniro]
Yo, yo, I could keep my eyes closed still reading the signs
Young n****s think they hungry then you feed 'em a nine
Might kidnap they a**, start feedin' 'em swine
So I don't feel bad when I gut 'em like a pig
Beat him down, stomp him out, cut him like he big
You hear the attitude; I say f*** being humble
You act like a animal; you stuck in the jungle
N****s don't care if I'm poor or rich
So I don't care about these n****s, and the law, and s***
And I'll probably get shot for being a wild n****
You'll probably get shot for being a foul n****
Let's talk about slugs and the drugs we deal
Boys fight, men kill, get they money and chill
Real recognize real; I ain't sayin' a word
Doin eighty in the M - that means I'm stayin' in third
With a b**** playin' shottie AK in the third

[Sheek Louch]
Don't worry 'bout what I make; worry 'bout can you escape
'Cause when I bust my guns, bring more action than roll take
Nickel your hallway, I got aim from far
Y'all can't see me like the tints on the president's car
I know n****s don't like me, and my friends want to flip
That's why I'm on some extra all about Sheek s***
Your money: Sheek s***
Your b****: Sheek s***
Only thing I'm gonna share is these bullets here
B**** a** that's for frontin' 
Now don't say I never gave you nothin'
I'm greedy; go 'head, don't say I never saved you somethin'
Pack gun n**** but don't want no stack
I drink straight liquor till I forget where I'm at
I don't play no games, n****, drugs my 'cupation
In a building hustlin' - that's Sheek's Playstation
Motherf***ers want to ride by and ice grill
Change that to ice, dick
Show me, motherf***er, that you can kill

Seventeen shots in a clip, twenty-eight grams in an ounce

Bodies gettin' dropped, five thousand n****s actin' live
Five thousand n****s gotta die; everybody better ride

[Jadakiss]
Y'all n****s better find out who's your man
It don't work in the hood; you could fool your fans
Few bullets in your jeans soon to ruin your plans
Then I show up at the wake and boo-hoo at your fam
If you're like me, you never'll fail
Live by the three rules you make it, or be dead, or in jail
And I ain't really got much, but I'm up on cats
And Kiss don't just spit, I throw up on tracks
Double R now, b****; you see the princess cut
I'm in a two thousand big boy; the tense is up
Y'all n****s is soft; catch me with the semi
Underneath the Fendi, sweater, skully, and scarf
Make sure you don't say nothing to Jay
And keep your dirt; I don't smoke nothin' but hays
I'm a do this the old way; get it while I can get it
As much as I can get, then I'm a go my own way

[Drag-On]
Aiyyo, I keep my guns like laundry
I dump a load, make n****s fold, watch 'em die, and let 'em drip dry
Gon' spill pints from n****s; my rapid fire put n****s in black attire
Stuffed in the hearse, then dumped in the dirt
I live eternal, 'cause if Drag pa** away
I'm a come back with wraps on my face, blastin' an eighth
February eighth - that's the day
You better cop like it's crack, or get masking taped till you suffocate
B****es, y'all gettin' your feelings hurt
Two thousand, I ain't f***in' no more
I'm makin' b****es jerk till I squirt
All my b****es work, like upside down from the poles
Lift that skirt, give this dick what it's worth

Hungry n****s come snatchin'
I throw bullets; run catch 'em

Keep the heat up in jeeps, in case y'all creep up on me 
I run up on y'all in a cab with a meter on me 
And the only on leavin' is me

All Drag do is fuck bitches, and drain his body
Kickin bitches out the bed and sleep next to a shottie
A bitch'll never get me pump, I make niggas pump IV
I'm the type to follow the cops wit a midget drivin me
Make them think the car drivin itself, and I'm in the passenger seat
Signal lights, stashbox, a package of D
Drag dash, I'm happy to be
On, this rap shit is like a jacket to me
I wear it with cracks in my sleeves
So I keep it on, don't never take my jacket off cuz my shit be gone
What are you, lost your mind?
It took my time to cut these dimes
So I could dump drug a few minds, so don't make me bust a few nines
Dip the T T in polish watch the shoe shine
Slip in the Tunnel with a banger in my bootline
All it takes is the finger to make a sour sit, linger

I got more bullets in my clip, than chocolate got in chip
I got more bitches suckin dick, than niggas smokin niks
I got more shit up in my whip, than most niggas got in cribs
I got more, blocks of raw while y'all tryin to stop wars
Coward nigga lock your doors
I'll come through with the locksmith and pop it
With the glock 4 and show y'all what a mouth's for
I got black steel, blue steel, wheels, I mean wheelchair
Cuz Drag is real fair, it's all real here
I own more buildings on my block, than real estate, philly ave
Hit ten niggas I'm tryin to see mils like Billy Gates
Cuz me in Philly rollin dutches
Me and Eve, stuck off the trees, got her laughin off bitches' weaves

Fiends come to me my top rock's been asleep
Seven foot bouncers bout to be six feet, under me
Now that's a foot left, you shouldn't have took that step

I know y'all wish y'all woulda, shoulda, coulda
Didda, getta, gotta, guns we cock it then pop it
Make 'em holler and swallow
Niggas stop it, catch it, all up in his jacket
I'm not a stingy nigga, I'll let a nigga have it
Hate chips that go away, lookin like white coke
Sit in the sun long, come back like french toast
Hair was up, now is down, eyes are black, now is brown
Used to frown, now you smile, nigga must have left you now
Went from bikes to the car, from the cars to the boat
Went from keys to the coke, went from coke to the dope
Went from cracks to the raps, went from bats to the gats
Went from slums to the stats, been to London and back
Me change cuz I rap, I can't do it
I went from muggin y'all to payin niggas to do it
It's all the same stupid
I got cake on cake, cuz I went from pow to pow
Wit my family, two R's, Ryde or Die

And she blackout when she in the mall
Got the brand new spring Prada shit in the fall
Don't matter what size panties, fitting her small
And she don't got no problem hittin' us all
And she said she got a man, but he in the fed
And she miss him so much that she pee in the bed
So you know I had to lighten her raw, fighting the dog
Pushing the seat back gettin' right in the fall
Make her use a fake credit card twice in a store
Might make you do it tomorrow you triflin' whore

I need a chick that ryde or die, pullin' the 5
Gettin' high with the Coogi frames over her eyes
Sweet to the tail, still won't fuck in a Benz
'cause she bought me a Polo coat and a couple of Timbs'
Doobie was rap, both in the movie with gats
Gave me head 'cause the movie was wack, word
Toasted her crib, blow in the fridge, she needed to work
I died and that bitch gon' put weed in my hearse
Gamed her to death, tattooed my name on her neck
You don't want to see me bangin' the left, hittin' the gas
That bitch out the window poppin' heat in yo' ass
You could catch holiday in to Holiday Inn
With a bad bitch swallowin' gin, word

Look at me as that cat that know how to box
Know about glocks, know about slingin' them rocks
Know about runnin' from cops and switchin' up spots
How to get rich, know about thuggin' a bitch
Fuck 'em in the park, fuck a sweet as the Ritz
They like that shit, and I ain't gotta spend no checks
Fuck diamonds, all they really want is rough ass sex
And they name, shout it out when I'm up at Flex
I get drunk with bitches that don't get drunk
Don't get high, have 'em doing drive-by's
Shit they never did, forgetting about they kids
Moms babysitting, ain't seen her in a week
I'm a bad influence to parents that hate Sheek
I need a ride or die bitch that'll take this coke

Damn it on ya lips

But don't it come wit that shit got a passenger seat (HAA-HAA!!)
Mommie want to fight, we can thump we can thump
Then I throw my Hammer like Pumps and a Bump
Love how ya look to the dome to the dome
Gotta big truck we can poppin the trunk
Mommie want to ask me why I'm so quick to slide a chick
Listen it might sound STUPID
But the reason why this star and handsome cat keep ya pants on 
Cause the sides to big 
Ya feel me?
You don't really want to try this kid, Ya feel me?
Cause you know I got shots to give, ya feel me?
Look at the ass on honey, look look at shorty
She know I keep the cash money like Woo-Woodie

And I love it when they through it in my face

But they still want to do me
Chick could have fooled me
How the hell you a professional the first time?
You ain't come yet?
O well I came to win 
You gonna come when I come back again

I tell you like Schwarzenegger ""I'll be back"" to pound ya back
Now mommie tell me how you like the sound of that?
Like when I hit it like (HMMM!!)
Now did I hit it right (YEAH!)
When I flip her over then I truck her like (DAMN!)
Well that's too tight

Better cock that thing 'cause the walls will creep

On the roll you can't tell the time or the day, and date

Have your bitch in the back of the Escalade
We can make things escalate
Pull out, make his man run on him and he had a gun on him
Busted you then make the right

To cut through the gas station and take the light
Can't tell me Ruff Ryders don't make it tight
Got to wonder what a Harlem, niggas life is like
And I transport keys if the price is right

Then ride back through your hood on a mountain bike
Got bullets that will go through your stomach
Then come out your head
I'm Infrared, you ain't know, I'm about this bread

And I wonder what your family gonna do
When they pronounce you dead
Then come through your hood with Gucci rims on
In the six with the rims on
Getting head from a bad redbone, bitch
That don't mind switching like to fuck with her timbs on

You don't want to fuck with me

That's how I let off frustration pertainin my past
Murder ya block, then drag's wavin at cabs
Feds is on cars that's why they give him on-star
Straight blood, when I walk in, throw on the red light bulbs
Then I throw my pinky ring on and writin up the club
I'm all real, why'all slight thugs, I'm just like
Them Arabs, fuck a gat, I use a knife
Keep my dick sucked like, straws in soda
Why'all know the deal like, cards and poker, huh?
I'm a monster on the street, I'll play all strips
I'll beat down lyrics and stomp out beats and dump out clips
If I ain't got it I crack knuckles on jaws, stab a couple on tour
Why'all faggots never knuckled up before, bitch

[Chorus 2x: fiend]
We don't give a fuck about none a why'all (none a why'all)

This'll silence yo' ass quick, put a apple on the tip
Then go sip, apple martinis and laugh about this shit
Niggaz want to look at my chest, nigga watch your eyes
Cause, drag'll give you his change and give you a surprise
Cause when I ride, I put a heart in them niggaz and get 'em live
Then let my toast, put the ghost in niggaz and watch it rise
Yeah I look out for my niggaz, but I'm not a town hero
When I walk, I set fire to the floor like ground zero
I'm the reason niggaz jumpin out of buildings, shit
They better let that hard ground kill 'em then they run down sizzlin
Got a hundred hidden guns in the wall where I live
So the only way I'm fightin for the wall is they comin to my crib
Double-are motherfucker, we runnin this shit
Cause every time we put in our guns why'all runnin and shit, bitch

[Chorus]
[Drag-On]
Listen, I wasn't born with stats, but I might stand while why'all was young
I used to be on the cheese line cause I was born to be a rat
My race is like a pizza pie, why'all can get a slice
And it won't be just them arabs runnin around with they face wrapped
So if you a thug - throw these slugs!
And not at my vest, throw it at my mug
Cause my niggaz'll get why'all back, love is love
Cause we all family and nigga blood is blood
I never back down, I put backs on grounds
That'll make your mother pull out that all-black gown
Man fuck this track, listen to how I sound
That's your block, that's your city, that's your town?
Bladoooow! it's mines now

And for my life the blessings that you have saved me
And for my wife

Carried me through the rough times throughout my youth
And through it that I saw you was still wit me

And I always loved my people but now they love me

Bleeding the blood of Christ over our life
Wrong or right just help us make it through the night
And we'll shout your name in times of need
And times of joy and when we bleed
And when we are overcome with grief
You don't have to tell me twice; I'm a take heed
And because of what you've given me, I know you'll deliver me
And I won't drown no matter how deep the river be

Kept the heart good when they told me it was bad, 
All praise is due to ya, that's why I had to dedicate somethin new to ya,

Messin' with the Thug Life, I missed it all
Open up the doors and let me in 
I'm done wit the cards so let's begin
Prayers that you give to me, I give to them
Same way you live in me I live in them
Life is a blessing now you got me smiling
From inside of my heart when inside it was dark
And it doesn't rain any more only sunshine
No pain anymore.... I really love mine
You wash away the tears with the fears
I'm happier than I've ever been in my life, in thirty years
You know that
One day I'll speak the word
You know that!
When I do, I will be hear
You know that!
You have me a permanent smile

Everyday the sun'll shine
Took this dream and made it mine
I'm gettin down one thing that I know (WHAT!)
We're untouchable

Gettin' down like what nigga, YO!

Rollin deep, holdin' heat, don't even think about sleep
When we creep, niggaz goin' down for the count
It ain't sweet, fuck around and knock money out

Come on fella, you don't want the dog with the camp
Not Old Yeller, a pitbull and dog is the champ
You know better, think about crossin' the line

And I was taught to buy guns so big when I go to the roof
I can aim and shoot down a plane

Infa-Red's my name but fuck all that
Fall back and witness how the streets made me the grimiest nigga alive
I sell you a fake pie, shoot out your fake eye
Give niggaz a break, nah; I gotta chase mine

Don't wear your watch around me nigga I take time
Like niggaz that them blue tried to like
I turn men to mice, canary yellow my ice
And Ruff Ryde on anybody, to be precise

But I handle my business like I'm supposed to
When you go in the precinct, that's the only time you see my poster
But I could post up and get rid of my pieces
I own collies sellin' rocks the size of Domino pizzas

I do what gangstas do, but don't get it confused
My floors mostly sand so you ain't gotta bring ya shoes
My crib is half house, half beach
Sit yo booty on this king size and see the sea
I'm a lil' freaky-o, I might lick ya toes
I got more zero's on my one's than Cheerio's
See your stilleto, shoes, your mac lip gloss

am I cocky coz I only play my shit and listen to myself
or am I striving for perfection? answer that
ah fuck it I cocky and I about to perfect rap nigga!
and I roam these streets
that's why my songs is deeper than death itself
I went from no food in the fridge to a platter on my shelf and I watch it
and y'all ain't gotta give me that but keep ya hand out my pocket haters!
coz you makin me nervous it ain't worth it
we don't want no accident when I flip on purpose
coz we don seen so many tradgeties done
September 11th, 2001 remember
like how could I forget I lost my man pop in that shit
help me get a grip
I think I'm losing it doo
because between life an death I be confusing the two

[Chorus:]
And sometimes I don't give a fuck if I live or die
but I think if I don't give a fuck about myself who else will I'm stressing

guess I was raised the wrong way
that's why I walk around with the long eighth
and dun shed so many tears I have none left
sometimes I sat and prayed for death
I feel like its 11:45 a quarter to 12
15 minutes to my days is over that's why its hard to stay soba
so I drink in the rain and smoke in the sun
and create my own clouds not have'n to think of the pain
sometimes I think I'm going insane
I get mad and shout God's name in vain
forgive me for my sins he got me laughing again
he got me back rapping again now help me choose my friends
my gats the closest one to me
but if my gun could take the stand and tell
ill be doing life in jail
like judge he made me do it
it ain't the gun its the nigga behind it that shoot it, that's ruthless

you see a lot of niggas don't want drag to shine
instead they want to see drag locked up like my nigga Shyne
so you know what they try to do, leave a nigga behind
You know what it is, they envy me
motherfucking niggas held me back for 3 fucking years
and motherfucking niggas left me for dead
hopin that the world would forget but you know what?
they didn't forget, they bought me back
and now I'm in the greatest shape of my life
so now I'm on some shit like fuck y'all
all I give a fuck about is my niggas and my niggas only
I'm on some shit like

y'all can suck these off
cause I don't need y'all to succeed y'all nigga
I know you like my word play early
like nelly got country grammar like er day
I can go cold and still sell out shows
and make enough dough to get your feet chopping not about your toes??
for coming at me half stepping
talking like gangsta shit and ain't have no weapon nigga
ah I got the best flow I be the best in the bronx
cause I don't walk through the swamps
striving through the alleys of death
recognize my destiny in life
even if it takes my last breath nigga
I walk in places where it could've been my last step
but god got me out of it
I love him and I'm proud of it
now can you feel my pain
see what I see walk in my shoes an still gon' keep sane NIGGA!",Feel My Pain,2004

Buy the whole bar and spit it on each other

Like if Drag really a gang member, or just involved
Y'all can be the boss of the bosses I'll be the cause of the causes
I rob from the rich and give to the less fortunate
Well I buy thousand whips and in your raps I floss this shit
I buy thousand kicks and give to the young orphanage
When I was young I was a soft kid 'till I snap
And they couln't get me off a kid 'cause he sold my mom's crack
In fact, I caught a case beyond that I couldn't face my moms
Crack addiction 'cause I was way beyond that but I face facts
I got busted over the left side of my face my face back
But I had to fix that

It ain't our fault, blames aside
It ain't the licks, it ain't the eyes

In order to feel that a real life shit and still rap 'cause
My rhymes still here so I done fried a few punks
My mom still here but she'll die in a few months
That's real life cancer and doctors ain't got the answer
I hope y'all felling this 'cause I ain't supposed to be telling y'all this shit
Like I ain't supposed to be selling y'all this shit but this is real life
Like I ain't supposed to be crying over this shit but I still mind
Shit just don't feel right but I'm gonna hold on
Till the hole in my 44 long
I'm gonna hit the gym and get my swoll on
Sometimes my head gone
And I don't give my pops props 'cause he was dead wrong
Pops was up, you know what, I don't give a fuck
The only thing I'm happy that you did was bust me out your nuts

But nigga this is real life it makes me clutch my glock real tight
It makes me want to fight but I get it off when I write
So these last few months my moms could live right, in new clothes
They said she might lose her sight fuck it she saw me blow
I reminisce sometimes I pull out old 40 year olds
It gets me stressed so I could smoke up like 40 of those
Sometimes I feel like walking with a mean bout
Busting till I see cops snowing till I see slot
Throw on a pair of flip flops take steps to the roof of the ledge
Till my feet stop but I need not, I got a life ahead of me
I got a wife in back of me, at least I gotta see my seed drop
Probation got me on a detox, so when I die, bury me next to the weed crops
So when I'm in heaven I can give weed to Pac and smoke trees with Big L

But some rapped in soft fabric this is deeper than marriage
Chip off your old block, your chip off your old pops
But you to young to hear my storys bout how I sold rock
But just yesterday I cut your umbilical chords
Doctor said you had several purports I guess you shook it off
Bless my god my first child my first born
I feel so rebirth like this my first song
I held you helpless, I couldnt help it
How could a nigga abandon his child?
I could never be selfish
Sometimes I feed him too much, throw up on his bib
I just gave birth to another one of God's kids
He can't see me yet his eyes closed
I love his baby smell, his baby size clothes, his eyes open, my eyes froze

Carried you over my shoulders, you my little soldier

First words now what's my name? ""DADA""
And you almost look the same as ""DADA""

You know your Dad Dad and where your Daddy at
Cause when I was your age son I hever had that
I'ma be there for my little nigga, you just a little nigga
Old enough to get potty trained no more dypers changed
I named him El Kwan so he could have a righteous name
And know who Allah be, and eat Halal Salami
And know how to salaam me, wa-alaikum as-salaam
Know who my babysitter I take him straight to my moms
Love it when I pick him up he comes straight to my arms

The first day of school I tought him respect so he had a little manners
So he pledge allegiance before he sung the star spangled banner
Walk with a bop, just like his pops
He wore his cap to the back coz he seen his Dad do that
Musta had his ear to the door cause he heard his mom's moan
Cause the first day he got the keys to the crib he brung a chick home
Okay time for the talk, you know what these is for?
Life support and I placed about 4 in your drawer
So what ever you do boy, jus don't go wrong
Whenever you need some more just come knock on your pops door
Cause you know I got em
I raised him, I dressed him
He dress himself now Allah blessed him he study Allah lessons
And I pray that the streets don't arrest him
His friends are pass him a spike lee joint
But I'll pass him the message
Sometimes I think like did I do right or did I do wrong?
Cause I made her have an abortion, now I wish that he was born
Because he would have been my first child, my first born

四角い空の下でいつもどうり
太陽は窓の外をあざやかに照らし
また新しい一日もたらし
脱ぎっぱなしの靴はいたところで
空飛べるはずもないし
はるか遠くの地では残酷な日々が
続くのにこんな僕達
ちっぽけな壁を目の前に
立ちすくんでるような
海の向こうの空
赤く染まる頃こんな僕達
ちっぽけな壁なんざぶちこわして

鼻で笑うように流れる世界

塗り替えるのは僕達の世代そう

何もせずにそれじゃ臆病なまま
時間が解決するって言ってそのまま
見て見ぬふりしてるならこのまま

絶え間なく響く笑い声も
無責任に描いた夢も過去の話
今じゃもう鳴りやまない
頭痛のたねは増え膨らみ出す

逃げ場探す暇さえなく
刻一刻と刻む流れにゆられ
それでも僕をそっとつつみ込む

Black shapes and horns
By my command, unleash the storm

Raising and forming alive
'Til delights get lost
In the sounds and power from hell

Blood of the damned
Invokes the scorned
Their helpless eyes just watching you
Drive home thy horn

Raising a prophecy of chaos and pain
That burst forth from flames to serve

What seemed metaphysical
But a faith that values darkned souls
Knows not that ways of man

Bound by crimson, bound by swords
Awaiting one last kiss
From unknown

Which way should the blood flow
Through the heart or out a hole
Asks the man about to become

Dragonette,"We get a little faded the colours go
Running out of all our clothes
And the flash don't light when the battery's low

When you could stamp a foot down through the floor
It's a better plan by far
To blow off the roof and let in the dark
So we better get started

And if I were you, I'd let go
And feel it all over inside like a chemical
'Cause to tell the truth
I don't know
If it's ever over

We don't need a cure for the weight of the world
'Cause it's floating round in the universe
Just swing it like it's tied by a string that you hold
And let it go

We could dig a hole right down into
Somewhere as deep as black and blue
And fill it with a crowd and the sound of right now

And we could carve a tunnel under
And find out just how low it goes, it goes
And we run out of dirt on the other side when we see the light

Well if I were you, I'd look up
And find a place there in the sky where there's room enough
To spread it out, and look 'round
For where to land when you come down

We don't need a cure for the weight of the world
'Cause it's floating round in the universe
Just swing it like it's tied by a string that you hold
and let it go

Let it go

Dragonette,"9 am
In your bedroom
The radio alarm clock
Is set for soon
I know you friends
And you know mine too
You don?t tell on me I won?t tell on you
I get around

Seconds to your elevator
From the station
How can I resist
That kinda invitation
Second floor and I?m in trouble
Gotta get me back down to street level
I get around

Here I come when I better go
I say yes when I ought to say no
Here I come when I better go
I say yes when I ought to say no

Quietly slide away off the mattress
Find my clothing on the bed post
So I tip toe out of this mess
As I slip back into last nights dress
I get around

Put a little lipstick back on my face
Blow a little kiss to you from the doorway
Walk the hall right past the stair case
Take the elevator back down out of this place
I get around

Here I come when I better go
I say yes when I ought to say no
Here I come when I better go
I say yes when I ought to say no
I say yes when I ought to say no
I say yes when I ought to say no
I say yes
I say yes
I say yes
I say yes
I say yes
Say yes
Say ya

I never got that particular feeling
I’m doing better now than how I’ve been
Then again I never really ever get anything right

I‘ve got a scab that I can’t stop picking
Things that I though I’d forgotten
Things that I thought got better over night
So what’s shaking, a complication

I though by now I’d be 5’11”
I’d be hanging out with the top banana
Executive access to upper classes
Run and get me some of them big sunglasses

Better gather up what I left for dead
All the pieces needed in a level head
All the information that I’ve taken down all on my own

So if you think you saw me getting by
I was only lost in another life 
And now I’m racing back to where I came from, I got nothing to show

But if you want it any tighter, we could cinch it
Dress up leather, wear every colour
I'm going Rococo with sequins in the summer

So come
Twirl your dresses around
Lift your cotton socks on
And turn your cameras on now for the fun

While I light a fire in your new shoes
If you should smile, look so surprised
While I light a fire in your new shoes
Look out that your soles don't burn to the floor

I light the fire

Buttons are busted, we're decorated
We make an ornament with gold and silver plating
So what's the latest, we raise a fever
We're just all red inside, that's all to see here

Yeah, we're red inside, we're all red inside
And the leg bone's connected to the one in the thigh
We are red inside, we're all red inside

Somewhere as deep as black and blue
And fill it with a crowd and the sound of right now

And we could carve a tunnel under
And find out just how low it goes, it goes
And we run out of dirt on the other side when we see the light

Well if I were you, I'd look up
And find a place there in the sky where there's room enough
To spread it out, and look 'round
For where to land when you come down

In the flames of hell we fire at will the fires of doom has come

And they die in their sleep for the world that will not care

See through the lives of the red hot stabbing eyes
Now is the time to defend your crown
Destiny will call to remind us all
We fly free so far from here there's one thing we'll relay
And dreams of everlasting pain the fallen now rise again

Through the fire, through the flames like the sun we'll rise again
Lost in time, lost in space to the end of other days

See their endless ways: insanity
The quest will rage, not meant to be
In flames of hell forevermore eternally

[Chorus:]
So free your heart leave your life far behind
In the cold dark winter skies escape the pain inside
Now feel your soul lost in scenes of all eternity
Every day of this life, defending
And the flames of youth not ending
In a lifetime, searching, we must fight through the eternal pain

So alone in the world far away, memories of the dream will remain
As the world's falling cold and your life's all in vain

Fire in your soul will forever rise again
Nothing in your mind to remember now
Held here by the fear of the dark land calling
Fly free on endless seas, the final curtain falls
On the ground from down below, the time to lock and to load

Through the fire, through the rain, far across the distant plains
Feel the wind beneath the steel as your mind becomes insane
Save the hate of all humanity, their eyes belong to destiny
For freedom now we rise alone again

[Chorus:]

So free your heart leave your life far behind
In the cold dark winter skies escape the pain inside
And when the memories are all left behind
And the days are gone forever, lost within my mind
Now feel your soul burn in scenes of all eternity
Every day of this life, defending
And the flames of youth not ending
In a lifetime, searching, we must fight through the eternal pain

Alive, still wander in a fallen land,
One more time we stare into the blackened sky,
For tonight, in our hearts now we feel,
One last time see our destiny reveal.

Shine glorious we ride, we stare into the blackened sky,
Save the last command, the virtue blinding,
So far beyond the sun, still blinded with the fire inside,
Once alone again, silence stands for our last journey home.

Shine glorious we ride, we stare into the blackened sky,

So far beyond the sun, still blinded with the fire inside,
Once alone again, silence stands for our last journey home.

Night falls and the stream is shining, forced the section behind the lines,

Will you wait alone for me tonight,
Hold me, save me

We all hold our place in the universe,
For eternity

Hide the lines, deceive myself, erase the past from my space,
Images of loneliness sent far across the land,
Once sure, but my eyes are blinded,
Frantic charge for a place to hide,
Lost generations apart, ancient life returns.

Kindness in her eyes, taken away by a man in disguise,
Won't you wait along again tonight,
Save me, take me

Trapped in the circle, so helpless
Forces beyond

Hide from the light, you feel so hypnotized
Filtered and disguised
Burning forever, try to remember
Sadness in her eyes

So many times now we've been here before
No more illusions behind the open door
Trapped within my fierce desire, resistance is futile
Screaming for your life, nowhere to hide
Tonight we cross the line, your innocence is mine

Falling down, my life fading now to the end
One last chance of glory in my heart again
Set me free from craving the one thing I can't have inside of me
But is it all a waste of time?

Lost in a misery, the fatal demise
Forced to a living that no one can understand
Hiding behind all the lies

A long time in slavery, it cries out in vain
Lurking around the shadows until the end
Fearless in fatal disguise

Wake from the dream, the life you left behind
Time to understand
Lost in the laughter, life ever after
Trials of a broken man

And through this madness a new day will rise
We shall remember the pain she held inside
Fear the pain inside my heart, our sacrifice in vain
Screaming for your life, nowhere to hide
This everlasting strain, driving you insane

Falling down, my life fading now to the end
One last chance of glory in my heart again
Set me free from craving the one thing I can't have inside of me

Break free from our loneliness, the last time

The sky will turn black, the nightfall appears
The hatred surrounding they hide in great fear
The evil all around the sound they will hear

In the silence ever searching on through the misery
And all the promises we made and cried in vain
Don't you take the time to realise the master of disguise?

Out of the dark pain is the price

Show us your might, gift from the sky

Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness
Bitches

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne

Forever ever Mr. West is in da building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams
Big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothin'
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin,
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't
You're such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back

It may not mean nothing to y'all

OK, hello it's the martian, Space Jam Jordan's
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the Garden
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads no such thing as last

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
I'm shutting shit down at the mall

And I ain't even planning to call

There they go, packing stadiums
As Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic wow
We can make them look like bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no go for broke
His cup just runneth over oh no
He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings
Til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save

Flo' so nice, you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big, and let the small fall under that
Damn, where you stumbled at?

First name greatest,
Like a sprained ankle boy ain't nothing to play with,
It started off local but thanks to all the haters,
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis,
In your city faded off the brown, Nino,
She insists she got more class, we know!
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo,
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo,
Dropped the mixtape that s*** sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one,
Yeah n**** I'm about my business,
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list,
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness,
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness,

I went hard all fall like the ball teams,
Just so I can make it rain all spring,
Y'all seen my story my glory,
I had raped the game young,
You can call it statutory,
When a n**** blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothin',

Fresher than the harvest

If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans,
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops,
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top,
Life is such a f***ing roller coaster then it drops,
But what should I scream for this is my theme park,
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark,
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk,
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention,
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention,
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer,
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover,

No brake pads no such thing as last

There they go, packing stadiums,
As Shady spits his flow,
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic wow,
We can make them look like bozos,
He's wondering if he should spit this slow,
F*** no go for broke,
His cup just runneth over oh no
He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed,
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose,
Back into the game and they know,
Rap will never be the same as before,
Bashing in the brains of these hoes,
And establishing a name as he goes,
The passion and the flame is ignited,
You can't put it out once we light it,
This s*** is exactly what the f*** I'm talking about when we riot,
You dealin' with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin',
And spit true feelings,
Til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthaf***a for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place,
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face,

I should want to go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gonna be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
As long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?

This shit was all I knew
You and me, only
I did it all for you
Still, you were lonely
We can work it out
Uhh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved
That person has it all
You just stuck standin' there
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
Say say something, baby, say something, baby, say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby",Say Something,2009
Drake,"You know, a lot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them
This is not to get confused
This one's for you

Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had

Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
Hah, and you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say, ""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause

Sex, love, pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til the nigga hit the jackpot

Just make sure they that special somebody

You know who you are
I got you",Best I Ever Had,2009
Drake,"Uh, I'm just so far gone
October's on, Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on
Where did we go wrong? Where do we belong?
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meaning if it rains, I'm the one it's raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been three years, look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm
Yea, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't 'cause

You know
Everything gone be alright
I promise
Apologize to you know
To put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but
40 Mom always say
Don't ask permission, just ask forgiveness, you know, so
Forgive me
Yea
Yeah I say

Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I've became,
Tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention, therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin' Western Union doing currency exchange
'Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed, like
How I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why yo' girl heart is in a slang
Call me Heartbreak Drake, I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man I'm just honest, as a artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
Yea, And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I remain

Me
Yea
Uh, I said I call this shit the calm.
But I'm the furthest thing from calm.
I swear I'm puttin' on
But they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like
Man",The Calm,2009
Drake,"This is why I do this shit
I think they call this, uh, venting

Yea
Look
Uh

This is me
Still the same
They want the hits
I play the game
No auto tune, but you can feel the pain
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
What up lil' braw
What up slumville
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mill
Equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal
That ain't how it works
That ain't that how it goes
And I been getting high to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer to balance my flows
But I never share my thoughts,
This is all a nigga knows
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to remembered and reprized
And I would be performing just as long as I'm alive
So every word I utter will be mine

Don't believe the lies
Look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me
Please don't be scared of me
I remember you
This feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me
Please don't be scared of me

Don't take this the wrong way but
I never cried when Pac died
But I probably will when Hov does
And if my tears hold value,
Then I would drop one for every single thing he showed us
And I'll be standing in a puddle
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
And I'ma keep it honest
Am so tired of being subtle
It's just me, Forty, O, and Nich standing in a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned about they profit from this from million dollar scheme
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your family this shit ain't what it seems
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles 'cause I bottle my emotions
At least I put it all in the open

Don't believe the lies
Look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me
Please don't be scared of me
I remember you
This feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me
Please don't be scared of me
Oh oh oh oh oh uh

Look
Fuck all y'all
We ignore feelings here
Premature millionaires
Welcome to my realest year
Yeah
I swear we making a killer here
I should be on top of the world here just chillin' here
Uh
But it's funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance,
And build you up so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when your there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same
Yeah
And plus things are just so real at home
People think I've changed just because my appeal's grown
And now security follow me everywhere
So I'm never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
I think I'm scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed
All my old friends think I got a new crowd
And people seem to notice every time I do smile
I guess that mean they come few and far between
Even though am living out what you would call the dream
Yeah
And my uncle ain't even messaging me
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
I hope this isn't one of those forever things
It's funny how money can change everything

Don't believe the lies
Look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me
Please don't be scared of me

This feeling isn't new

You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue

Or why, or how, or when

Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you

Although I would be glad to
I'd probably go and tattoo
Your name on my heart

Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol

Big dick bandit
Money flowing like a slit wrist, no bandage
Blowing purple clouds, nigga, I'm so sky high
I ain't cutting anybody slices outta my pie

And I don't sit still I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth, so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop

And if I brought it in the club
Then I'ma motherfucking spend it

But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soaking wet, she only five-two
And Forty, that was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in
So try to keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end
My girl love me, but fuck it, my heart beats slow

She on a Jubilee call me the X-man

Drake,"Yeah, I appreciate your patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's, you know, best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is

Look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm a group of seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'm a do it reppin', I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyeing me all hard
And lying to they girls and driving the same cars
Sitting there wishing they problems became ours
‘Cause we have nothing in common since I done became star
I done became bigger swerving writing in my peer's lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
‘Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doing them shows
Getting everyone nervous, ‘cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas
It's all good, I'm going off, like lights when the show's over
Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster
Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker
They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all
These cases don't work out I hope we can agree on
Making enough to pay any Judge Judy off
First thing I'm a do is free Weezy, go

And I'd take probation
I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane, pick location
I'm going to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones Jr. fighting the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me unguarded
And I'm a cheese head, word to Vince Lombardi
Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the red sea parted
My gun go crazy, like it's retarded
Red light on it, like it's recording
I ain't recording, I'm just C-4ing
My currency foreign; we are in a league they aren't
Better dig in your pocket and pay homage
Better cover your eyes, your face fallin'
Watch the game from the side, I'm play callin'
No, I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments for your garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K-y, no homo, I'm on it
Weezy F Baby, new born bitch
You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch
I'm going get money, money I'm gon' get
Young Money in your tummy and we gon' shit
And get that toilet paper quick, like when Bones spit
That's right, bitch, I'm back on my grown shit
That Audemars Piguet, no ice, just chrome shit
And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream, ""Fuck the world with a long dick!""
Motherfucker, I'm me! Yeah, bitch, I'm me!
You niggas sweet, like the pussy in which I eat
Fireman burn down your entire street
So fly I'ma take off when I leap
Bye! Then you can suck my wings
Stand on my money, head butt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things
I'm shuffling the cards, 'bout to cut my queens
But I ain't the dealer
House full of bitches, like Tila Tequila
Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror
My swagger just screaming, motherfucker, do you hear her?
Drizzy Drake what the lick read
We make magic, boy; Roy and Siegfried",Ignant Shit,2009
Drake,"Yea

Black Ferrari with the red seats
I call it playin checkers
I'm never doing verses
I'm forever giving lectures
If you're tryna meet with money
I'd be happy to connect ya
Life is, better than its ever been
Scheduling million dollar meetings with the president
Someone cut the lights on
Where is Thomas Edison
Got a new condo watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you tryna zone I got a whole swisha sweet full
Rappers are liars and they women are deceitful
Adding till they subtract me I never be a equal
Last place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me just write every single thing you need down
Then he got it for me and I'm happy as can be now
Bout to start ballin' like I'm coming off ofa rebound
Yea
And I should have the most bragging rights
Because a nigga spit crack, bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they tryna get they swagger right
Cause I done came wit mo' fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you pussy ass hater you should do you
You ain't heard of me then you should go and get a Blue's Clue
Oops I mean a red clue
Wayne's here, su WOO
Bet he felt that like the end of a pool cue
But I ain't banging I ain't waving no flag
I'm ATF but they ain't seein no badge
Its heartbreak Drake I hate to see 'em so sad
I could son you, see a little me in yo' dad
I'm the same yellow boy that used to play up on degrassi
Can pocket twenty thousand to be anywhere they ask me
Cash like Johnny, Banks like Ashley
Burning like a Camel Light
Stupid hoe ash me
But don't ask me shit about me
And kno the game really ain't shit without me
She might have to pay me but I dick her down free
Wanna know if its the truth then pull the zipper down and see

I didn't know I was on the way down
Cause you don't feel the same
It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game

I had a billion or two in the bank
I gave to charity, ain't got no thanks
You gave me all that a woman could give
Less you're affection, I don't want to live

Drake,"Can I, can I save you from you
'Cause you know there's something missing
And that champagne you've been sippin's
Not supposed to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do girl
'Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I must say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making the mistake I never learned from

I swear I, always, fall, for your type, yeah (for your type)
Tell me why I, always, fall, for your type (for your type)

I just can't explain this shit at all
(fall for your type)
I just can't explain this shit at all
(fall for your type)

(I believe in people like you)

So who am I to judge you on the past, girl
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
It's too late, I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before

I swear I, always, fall,
For your type, yeah (for your type)
Tell me why I, always, fall,
For your type (for your type)

Uh yeah uh
Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and starting over
Girl, quit playing you just drunk, you just saying shit
Oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and shit
Oh, wait, no, I get it girl, I'm with it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn, I wonder why I never learned my lesson
It's feeling like the second chance and its the first impression
And I heard it's nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen,
'Cause man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different
That's why I'ma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about
How reckless I have been
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invested
Making all the same mistakes
And I'm just trying to correct it and I fall

I swear I, always, fall, for your type, for your type
Tell me why I, always, fall, for your type, for your type

To day getaway and we don't need our clothes
We at the pool and she lookin' like a center fold
Two tattoos but she say she gettin' plenty more
She got Indian in her family, Seminole
Me and shawty go together like chemicals
And she get mad when I call other woman hoes
You send a rose, I pick some flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear, than lick around her lobe
And when she check her watch, it's never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came, she caught me like the common cold.

Ain't nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love,

I love you more than I love myself

Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just can't be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself

Hurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly,
So many lonely sleepless nights,
I'm going through hell to convince you love me,
But never her approval no matter how I try,
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you,
I'm ashamed you can see it in my eyes,
Momma always told me to respect the woman,
But what am I to do when her parents do not try

So many tears I cried,
But all for nothing I'm afraid to say
Ooh

I've been so dependent on your love for so long,
Punishment for me is trying to let go,
Give it from your heart is what you taught me,
Addiction to pain is what it got me,
My life, now its changed,
My life ain't the same as it was,
Heart broke to the point, sometimes wanna end it,
If I can't have what mean most to me

So many tears I cried (I cried)
But all for nothing I'm afraid to say

When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there's pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink
And you still got underwear that's sittin' in the dryer
How come every time that you're suspicious I'm a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that's the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn, tell me what I'm gone do
Since everything I'm trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh, you see the same one I'm missing
Is basically the reason I became somethin' different
Its just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then we'll be for sure

You can only show fear
Unless you feel yours in jeopardy

Automatic weapons on the flo' but who can you call

Exotic red-bottom sole body glitter in gold
Follwin' fundamentals, I'm followin' in a rental
I love a nasty girl who swallow what's on the menu

As my goals unfold right in front of me

I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship

I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me
Who could of predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip rags want to cover me
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good, all in all, I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first

And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's saying she's more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic

Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texted saying she wished she would have kept it

Man, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
I'm holding on by a thread
It's like I'm high right now, the guy right now
And you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now

I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I started treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe 'cause a girl I thought I trusted
Was who set the whole shit up
But in fact I haven't seen them since they locked Big Rich up
I know but same time I'm quick to forget
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets

It's okay, you could thank me now, uh, yeah
Well alright
Here I Go

Uh, Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
Aloha's to women with no ties to men
That I know well, that way there are no lies
You can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of influential, I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just want to party, Patron straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
OVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
Yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who would have thought the route we'd chosen
Would ever end up this scenic?
I can relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time
That your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike
But got to A.I. him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
'Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us
So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
That you take for granted, you can thank me now
And oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome
At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
'Cause they think that I can help them
Get back to where they fell from
But drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life, yeah
That's how you know it's going down
In case another chance never comes around

You could thank me now, uh, go 'head

Uh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it
Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
Man, the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion
Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
Do I? or is missing what we had out of the question?
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroe's
Who was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of they soul
But those same ones from your area will grow into women
That are ready to get married at hello
Because of what they allowed, where are they all now?
I know they're somewhere watching
So I'm trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
They tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
They say the doors will open up
Soon as you find the missing key
That's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagon's full
But you can try and run behind it, I'm sorry
Poolside drinking, Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game
In which the cards are facing down
I'm in a world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while I'm still here in this position

You could thank me now, uh, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said

And rappin', rappin' and bitches until all of it switches
I swear, it's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing ""walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah""
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve

Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance

So why am I in class if this is who I'm trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid
And if I don’t do nothing, I'mma ball

So I’m going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don’t trust these hoes at all
But that’s just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple porn stars that I’m ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna are my only role models
Heffer and Jordan my only role models
That’s why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it’s whatever if somebody wan’ make it a thing
I’m more concerned what niggas thinkin’ about Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields they’re making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well

In a time where it’s recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin’ fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I change rap forever, the game back together, yup
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I’m a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven’t figured it out cause my story is far from finished
I’m hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin’ emotion don’t ever mean I’m a pussy
Know that I don’t make music for niggas who don’t get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I’m heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson boost the rate up, it’s time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin’ spooky

Thicker than the plot does
And when you forget her, that's when she pop up

Or get three SUVs for n****s dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions
About all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and gla**es of Dolce
That s*** right up your alley
You see a girl and you ask about her
B****es smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
It’s feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
Instead of getting a pat down, they just keep on
Saying that they feel you, n****

Been way too long

I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
Why won't it start? The ride
Why won't it start? The ride

You won't feel me 'til you want it so bad you tell yourself you're in it
And tell the world around you that your paper work is finished
And steal your mothers debit cards so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute, you got it
You know its real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment fifteen o three, some couches and paintings
When you record with two others that want the same things
Yeah, it start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But s*** you bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs and hopes that you can beat a n****
And come out every night to let the city see the n****
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you they just keep on telling you they feel ya n****


I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
Why won't it start? The ride
Why won't it start? The ride

I haven't been inside terminal one and three in so long
I'm driving right up to it now, make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold especially after summers rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year, it's got you asking what's good at home
What's good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I shoulda known
My young n****s poppin' M's and sippin' dirty jones
Problem children that all be reppin' Octobers Own
Brand new girl, and she still growing
Brand new titties, stitches still showing
Yeah and she just praying that it heals good
I'm bout to f*** and I'm just praying that it feels good
I really don't know much but s*** I know a secret
They say more money more problems, my n**** don't believe it
I mean sure there's some bills and taxes I'm still evading
But I blew six million on my self and I feel amazing
Young money maker, season ticket holder
Season switching over
I come through them b****es still scorching as if I didn't notice
You n****s gettin' older, I see no threat in Yoda
I'm out here messing over the lives of these n****s
That couldn't f*** with my freshman flow
Look at that f***ing chip on your nephews shoulder
My sophomore I was all for it, they all saw it
My Junior and senior will only get meaner
Take care n****

I'm still faded, faded, faded, faded (the ride)

Regret got shit on what you're feeling now
Mad 'cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad 'cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take, all the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alicia, Katia
I know that you gon' hear this, I'm the man
Yeah I said it, bitch I'm the man
Don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now, that's me
And the voice in your ear, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are, then I made it
And you're wasted with your ladies
Yeah I'm the reason why you always getting faded

Take a shot for me, ooh
Take a shot for me, ooh
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

Okay look, I'm honest
Girl I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
'Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your ""Mr. Perfect""
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

I've asked about you and they've told me things
But my mind didn't change
I still the feel the same
What's a life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours we both know
We know, they don't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thanking you, just don't know
Trying to run from that, say you're done with that
On your face girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the parties over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry,
You won't ever have to hide
And you seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

It's my birthday, I get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I lie if have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know,
You hate being alone, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin' to save you

They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club, mm
Fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays its six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some

They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yeah
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in?
Man all of your flows bore me, paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even know that I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

I know, I know that you love me baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

You say I'm old news, well who the new star?

Used half of the money to beat my brother's case

I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before huh?
I still got ten years to go huh?

Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aliyah's precious life go too soon,
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it

Got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib
Goddamn man she's beauty and the beast (Lord)

Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing

The fam here, the drink here, the girls here?

And the line around the corner it's my motherf***ing time
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now.
I wouldn't doubt it cause these b****es all about it right now
Let's be real about this s***, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She said ""you're such a dog"" I said ""you're such a bone.""
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention though they always saying ""Show me something.""
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that

And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now
But this money coming in is just confusing shit right now

Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now

I’m feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I’m in the matter of man arm wrestling hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that would keep him in Mercedes Benz

Thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can’t see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality living in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we making
Then he said that he was the same age as.. myself
And it didn’t help cause it made me even more rude an impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO, the reason why I’m breathing all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why, the highlight was when he said,

Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl I needed that from you
I'm getting money just taking care of me, girl
I'm spending time just taking care of me right now
I'm getting money just taking care of me, girl
Cause you'd be tired of taking care of me by now

But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long

Don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chilling in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you're starting to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-town
But when it's all done, baby, I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows

But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long

Drake,"It’s like o nine in your basement and I’m in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn’t ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ask shit and we argue about spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I’m just like my father, my one button, you push it
Now it's ""Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat""
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you're sorry
You love me, and I love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank
'Cause leave it up to me, J, and neeks, we're probably gonna end up robbing a bank
Then Wayne calls on my phone, conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son and that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out girl, we shoulda known
'Cause you deserve it

This shit real, should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
We stressed out, and you need some, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

It's like o six in your backyard and I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, just when it's that real, is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid
Damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid but
That still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn your house feel like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all new, she
Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting, I'm more in touch with the music
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, to you got to me you
You tossed the keys and loaned me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's goin' through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back
Checks bounce but we bounce back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't where I'd really be without that,
It worked out man, you deserve it

This shit real, should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
We stressed out, and you need some, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done",Look What You've Done,2011
Drake,"People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I’m just proud of the fact that you’ve done it your way
And the weekends here started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends
That you said you might bring
If they’re the ones that tell you that you do the right thing

Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh babe, oh babe, why is this so familiar?
Just may already feel like I know the real her
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time
We must’ve been here before, it’s still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won’t find
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time

They keep telling me don’t save you
If I ignore all that advice
Then something isn’t right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekends here started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too. There’s things we might discover
Cause you got a path and I do too, we’re perfect for each other

Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh babe, oh babe, why is this so familiar?
Just may already feel like I know the real her
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time
We must’ve been here before, it’s still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won’t find
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time

Cause to her I’m just a rapper, and soon she’ll have met another
So if tonight’s an accident, tomorrow we’ll recover
And I know I’m not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don’t wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if I’m with it, and I’m with it
I know what makes her smile, but I won’t know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain’t your first, but it’s better than your last, Tunechi

You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time
We must’ve been here before, it’s still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won’t find
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time

Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote ""bad bitches"" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim
We lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colourblind
Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, 'cuz
Everybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them ""that ain't true""
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what you can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or someone that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell ""Girl, that shit crazy!""
Oh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful, bitches got the rabies",The Real Her,2011
Drake,"Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even steer straight, I can't even steer straight
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot
But I'm the truth that's right I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you ask me about my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Reppin' bitches, reppin' bitches bitches
And reppin' reppin' them bitches until all of us switches
I swear, it's been two years since somebody ask me who I was
I'm the greatest man I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important and what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love it a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love it a nigga
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)

Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
And rich crust with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I a classic, this is who I'm trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that term-end papers they won't get me paid
If I don't nothing I'ma ball
I'm countin' all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah need that, making major changes to the life I'm living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decisions
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga

So I took my Chronic album and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way, when police came our way
My daddy had his act on like it never happened (Broadway)

With some girls that say they models but umm, I don't believe 'em
Who's still getting tested?
Where's all the women that still remember who they slept with?
Where's all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list?
But when you do go out, you still working what you was blessed with
Do it girl, I'll be the king to your Queen Latifah
I love your ass like Milhouse loved Lisa
I love your ass like the Ninja Turtles love pizza
Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of, you got it girl
This song remind me of Cat from Philly, a girl I used to love
Until she started acting silly, her heart's a little chilly
She a little too carefree in 10 years
Who's paying for all that therapy? Umm, nigga not me
I'm probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
Most of the shit I say is true
When I’m done with bad bitches, know I’m coming straight to you good girl

Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with
And never buy a chick a bag on the first date

I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one, yeah,
Fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be gotten and I'ma get that shit
Cause I'm on one, I said fuck it I'm on one

I'm burning purple flowers
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I'm  out on bond I might be facin' eight's
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London as she screams
Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain't fair (Khaled)

You know the feds listening,

I'm a made nigga
I should dust something
You niggas on the bench
Like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the swishas
I'm focused might aswell say cheese for the pictures
Oh, I'm about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to the world like Mayans
It's a celebration bitches, Mazel Tov
It's a slim chance I fall, olive oil

Make sure they give me all the credit I deserve
Make sure the good stuff's still in that Sprite
They watch us make that shit into a song

Anything could happen when I do see ya
Guess it all depends on how I'm feelin' that night

I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone of the Belvee’ and ‘tron it’s too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy
I’ll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie
I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
(You know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do
(You know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do
(You know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do

I said now what it is, what it do, home girl ain't got a clue
If I get you open all the things that I would do to you
Smack it up, flip it down, weigh it up, break it down
Lean you to ya side yeah and ask ya who’s ya daddy now
Ain't even gotta open your eyes, know what your looking at
And I ain't even have to open my eyes when I was cooking that
Guess it was love at first sight, eye contact
Remember the night we first met, I caught a contact
Now she's my ride or die, it’s us against the world
You know we both hustlin’ so hustlin’ is our world
Said I must've had too much to drink I’m in my G-Mode
So all the ladies repeat after me cause it’s the G-Code
Promise if I get locked, you’ll come and pay my bond
If you hear some niggas plotting on me, you’ll ring the alarm
And every time you give it to me it’s gon be the bomb
And in these unlucky streets you’re gon’ be my lucky charm

[Chorus]

(Man, that boy so cold, give him a blanket in here)

I D-O, I D-O, I D-O oh oh
I, Vito, promise to treat this game, I D-O
Honor the code, not bring drama to mama’s peephole
Life’s a bitch but she's the only love that I know -ow -ow
So la-a-dee, after the “I Do’s” lets do Mercedes
Lets tie the knot, lets grab us a pot, lets make a baby
Looking back, I don’t know who threw this bouquet to me
But I walk down this aisle faithfully, cut that cake for me
I, Jay-Z, take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
And 'til the task force roll
To hug her every corner 'til I get ash from the cold
Or until I’ve amassed a fortune, too much cash for me to fold
Fold under pressure I would never, ever, ever, ever
Your secrets I treasure, for better or worse
You’ll always be my first love 'til death do us part
Pull a hearse up, my verse up

[Chorus]

Nothing's more attractive than a heavy praying woman
To a him and those and them been defecating on me (ughh)
Her would sense the heaven, and him when Andre omen
Baby I’m hell, save me, don’t bail
Crazy I tell you all of this in the middle of a club
Where words tend to get thrown around lightly like like like ""love""
""Friend,"" ""rock star"" and ""So and so’s a genius""
So him vow to never utter him do unless him mean it
Her proud like her mother and ooohh momma’s sweet
So you just know that Juicy fruit ain't gon’ fall too far from tree
So if we ever woop the woop
I want all that bleepty bleep
On this nasty carpet Bixby fresh on one knee
Say I do I do I do I do I do
So we can float up outta here in this hot air balloon
Lets put a baby butterfly up in your lil’ cocoon
And maybe twenty-thirty our baby, she’ll be nerdy make the whole club swoon

And I ain't no connoisseur but I'm kinda sure you will admire my taste
But before the sun graze ya
I'm tryin to see how deep you are
And believe me shorty I ain't talking about no intimate conversation
I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable
When I peek into your nature
And I promise you my goals well exceed any physical pleasure
I wanna, give you whats better than better
The better my effort, the wetter her treasure
The more these mere moments seem like heavens or temporary forevers
Shorty get it together

May your love come down so my mind might have you
You designed my imagination
Let me redefine foreplay so you need five and
Tell me shorty you got it baby
If its not it baby, hope its progress baby
Let it all drip baby
If you stop that shaking, no more talking baby, no more talking baby

Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples that my baby tastes the best
I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test
Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex
Paid it off cash so I never wrote a check
Leave my cars at her crib I'm just stuntin' on her ex
Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess
I love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh uhh

Crib on the water got LeBron up the block

Feels better when you let it out don't it girl

Then we fuck all night til things get right

Belt buckles, door handles, gold plated. Bal main rich denim, out Vegas

Im'a trip go to Cannes France to catch a flick
Baby listen, this position is a blessing and 
With your permission hopefully you'll learn a lesson

And I won’t ever rescue me the peak of your mountain
Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you
And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you
Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil
To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia
Hol' up, showing off some Asian provocateur
Rushing you out your draws
Though patiently get you off
Hate when they get too anxious though
Hate when they be too dull
Like to get too deep
But I hate to get too deeply involved
How sweet is you
Let me see some proof
Fuck making pussy talk
I like to make it sing a tune

We don’t need a spoon

Go, go!

I recognize your fragrance (hol' up!)
You ain't never gotta say shit (woo!)

A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis

With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress (ooh!)
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less
And we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real

Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter is true

Love is not just a verb, it's you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you looking for a maybe
Call me crazy, We can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm
That's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly
And right before you go blind

You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know,
You hate being alone, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin' to save you
Instead they say

These are my one St. Thomas flows
Me and my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins
But trust they down to go
Discussin' life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds flow
Fine dining, pour another another glass when the wine is low

I'm in the crib stackin' money from here to the ceilin'
Whatever it is I got is clearly appealin'
These other rappers gettin' that inferior feelin'
I hope you feel it in your soul spiritual healin'
Take a look at yourself the mirror's revealin'
If you ain't got it you ain't got it the theory is brilliant

People ask how music is goin' I heard it pays
I just came off makin' 2 million in 30 days
Damn I guess it does what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spendin' my money just because
But Weezy I'm just out here reppin' us
'Til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessin' us

Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smellin' like teen spirit
I asked kindly if no-one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no-one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite when me and your favorite singer meet up

Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that women is the next one on my list
I should call it a night but fuck it I can't resist
This one is for all my niggas from my city tryin' to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail that feelin' there is the shit
I swear, aghh pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass lookin' down pick your head up
No-one told you your disguise is the most ridiculous gettup
With nose plugs in now I can smell a set up
So your just wastin' your time your just only makin' me better

Yeah I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
Damn that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in a couch
Now we just fuckin' all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time everything has clicked
What if I dont really do the numbers they predict
Considerin' the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
'Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect y'all to get

I'm nervous but I'mma kill it, 'cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwin' up in a huddle nigga Willie Beamen 
We're still throwin' touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Man is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze

OK, niggas be hatin' I'm rich as a bitch
100 K I spent that on my wrist
Two hundred thou I spent that on your bitch
Do me a model put that on my list
Oh there he go in that foreign again
Killin' the scene bring the coroner in
Murder she wrote, swallow or choke
Hit her and go, I won't call her again
Woke up early morning, crib as big as a college
Smoke me a pound of the loudest
Whippin' some shit with no mileage
Diamonds cost me a fortune
Them horses all in them Porsche's
You pussies can't handle, afford it
$4,200 my mortgage
Ballin' on niggas like Kobe
Fuck all you haters you bore me
Only the real get a piece of the plate
Reppin' my city I'm runnin' my state
Keep me a pistol then run with the K's
Niggas want beef then I visit ya place, Bang!

There go that flow bringin' tragedy in
Copped me a chain your salary spent
Niggas is sweet, bring them cavities in
Countin' money, hourly trend
Rolling them skinny like Olsen twins
Niggas is squares, cabin Benz
Neck full of Gold Olympian shit
Neimans, I'm blowin the check on the gear
Fall in some pussy then hop on the leer
Strapped with them choppers in back of the rear
Sak pase, them killers is here
Woke up early morning, mind is tellin' me money
Paper, mula, pockets is fat as a tumour
Millionaire nigga no rumour
Livin' my life off of tuna
Want it with me, I deliver the beef
Real niggas only enjoyin' the feast
Pull up a seat, bon appetite
No Louboutin's when that red on your sneaks, Bang

Photographs of dope boys (I see you)
Is all they taking, finger prints on the Rolls Royce
Is why they hatin' push a button on these broke boys
That's detonation, walk a road to riches bare feet
I watch mama struggle now she livin' care free
That's why I hustle for that half a key that's 12 G's
I'm tryin' to bubble every summer a new LP
You gotta love me I got shooters out the D-League
Signin' bonus hit that man that's from thirty feet
Left in a puddle, finger prints is on a hundred mill
And what it is? Ricky Rozay and Ace Hood
We hella Trill
Yeah

About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy do I smell beef? Mmmm pheromones

Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry

I was only five but still remember the drought in '87

Drake,"""Good God Almighty, like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play
How to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock
But um, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had champagne in the studio, of course, you know
Compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much
As we enjoyed playing it for you, because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow""

Yeah, uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn

Dame made millions, Bigg made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

Yeah, uh, look, fuck all that ""Happy to be here"" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferrari's all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg",Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2,2013
Drake,"Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
'Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
'Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford tuscan leather smelling like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup

Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, young money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
I don't change like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from bundy to winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (talk to 'em)
The fresh prince just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, ""accept yourself""
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorcese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

If there's hell below, I'll see you when you get there
Are you enjoying yourself?
If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational
Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all
Are having the same fears, shedding similar tears
And of course dying in so many years
It don't mean that we can't have a good life
So we'd like to just maybe close out with something
Some food for thought for all of us",Tuscan Leather,2013

With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game

Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left

Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high

Drake,"What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that, I'd never make you feel like that

'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you've been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Yeah I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Uh, thinking 'bout Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn’t
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I thought we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I’m living I just hope I’m forgiven
It seems like you don’t want this love anymore
I’m acting out in the open it’s hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?

I love me, I love me enough for the both of us

Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out""

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Ooh, don't think about)

Uh, someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, ""Oh, well, this is life, I guess,"" nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Started treating me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Ooh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, ooh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much

If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fucking out of spite
'Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like

Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's about who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets
I know, luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause there's niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
And fucking with me mentally, I think it’s meant to be, yeah
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

Envy
Is a sign of admiration
Hate
Is the epitome of destruction

Tal parece
Que mi amor crece y crece
Pero tú desvaneces
Y me ofreces tu amistad
Sin otra excepción

Se que hay otro hombre
Que ha logrado lo que yo jamás a ti te di
Un hogar
Una familia
Un buen porvenir
Perdón por hacerte daño

Y por ti
Vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido
Ardiendo por los celos

Perdí tu amor
Soy un pobre diablo

You were the one
You’ve been the one

Sometimes I questioned
If this is all real then I grab
On that ass and I firmly believe it

And you
Look like you drawn by an artist
No you
You look like Bernice & Yaris
But both put together
Those are some girls
That I know from back home
If you see ’em you’ll get it

Look don’t worry about it
Keep speaking Spanish
I’ll get it translated
You know you my baby

Anything for you
Anything baby
I do not wanna be enemies baby
I would just much rather give you a baby
And buy you a house
So I live with you baby
Don’t stay with this new guy
I really go crazy

Yeah, that was a set up for a punchline on duct tape
Worried bout if my butt's fake
Worried 'bout John's singing us Drake
These girls are my sons, John and Kate plus eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dealing with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update
Hut one, hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me even if their name was pop quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is cutlet

Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you

Accountant say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girl from a Bida if she wave
Baby and I fucked with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? I take mothers instead
You got the hickups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp boy, treat me like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses with arm and guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two goons and they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms

Now I walk into the buildin' and go off like ""Nigga we made it!""
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin'
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!
You fly out your lady, I fly out my ladies
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous
Imma just hand her a business card and say ""Nigga we made it!""
And she gotta come to the hotel and pop it off for me
Then she gon' text her best friend like ""Girl he got some good dick and money""
Her friend hit her back like ""I know that already, that nigga's amazin'""
Then I send a message to both of they asses like ""Nigga we made it!""

And all of those lawyer fees, nigga I paid it

My life for your life, man I wouldn't trade it
I would just look at you dead in the face and say ""Nigga we made it!""

And my resolution for New Years is nigga we made it!
You don't know how long I waited
I coulda been waitin' on tables, my karma's amazin'
I'm out in the Caymans
Rented a 12-bedroom house just to sleep all the women we came with
That's ignorant, ain't it?
Sometimes I question myself when I think 'bout the pictures I painted
Then I pick up my brush  and I sign at the bottom
Like ""Nigga we made it!""

Aye
We made it

And my momma, everything gonna be all good

We stay paper chasin'
Separatin' the real from the fake
The fake from the real
We livin' to die and dyin' to live!
Nigga, that's why we got so many women
I'm tryna go deep, hit them asscheeks
Bust them guts, make her cum

Drake,"Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you a out of town
Nigga like Biggie heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got LA unified, you're better off committing suicide
Teachers ain't testin' us
See I know how it feel to be platinum plus
Niggas is jealous of you so they try to wrap you up
Tat you up, but it's OVO blood money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dark fame is a mothafucka
Do a nigga four favors, when you can’t do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny's house
Leave you lyin' like Fif'
How a nigga supposed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Dre told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walk around the crib like
Why a nigga can’t live? Get this money, fuck these bitches though
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like
We can pass these motherfuckin' straps like a physical
This my city, nigga everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up

Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit

All I ever asked is 100

Thank me later, thanks for nothin'
Thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearing your true colors to every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me, while they was skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop
And I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself

Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil Snupe, I was Meek Mill, nigga
Know how it feel when you're missin' your nigga though
Can't think so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figueroa
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, ""Here it go""
Screamin' Frog's name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter dawg 'cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga

Not even when you sayin', ""Drizzy, tell 'em again""
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell out event, oh
You need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryna make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame or what you'd do for freedom
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me

You boys are getting into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay the flow start to feel familiar, don't it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got twenty million on it
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it

Easter egg hunting, they gotta look for something

I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit
Like Soulja, I thought I told yah, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like Macgyver, I'm Michael Myers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'

Young but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing
I'm old, you gotta know
I'm here to fuck with niggas souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly 'cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, this not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public

If you were worried about where
I've been or who I saw or

What club I go to with the homies
Baby don't worry, I know that they got me",6 Man,2015
Drake,"Yeah, oh you gotta love it
Oh you got, oh you gotta love it

I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep, wanted more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation but can't change it alone
I heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
Quite a platform you chose, you shoulda kept it inside
Oh you tried, it's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual my career's like a how to manual
So I guess it's understandable man

Oh you gotta love it, you gotta love it cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my message like we have words
And stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year
Fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach to you so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to RIP about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it

Oh you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public
That's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again
That's that comeback flow, comeback flow
Once I start it's apparent
I wanted a girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yea, boy you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of ya'll
""Best I Ever Had"" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take at ease, where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses
Putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe

Oh you gotta love it
And head to toe I'm Prada covered
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it",6PM in New York,2015
Drake,"I got some shit for you to come and get

Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club? Cashin' out with everything

Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit
All, on me
I don't deserve it
She's just a little too perfect
She's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog

Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer, hit me when you're done your shift

At somebody’s house

Drake,"Having conversations with mama, man my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, ""I heard you back with you know who
I told her, ""Girl, I'm always back with you know who""
And she like, ""Who are we kidding
You're 27 you just being you
You're your father's child, man thank God you got some me in you""
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's always someone better
Like that girl from that gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's a angel but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day but even one day with us is a time of a life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart but I'm not here to give out compliments, or boost nobody confidence momma
I got no friends in this momma
I don't pretend with this momma
I'on joke with this momma

I sing a hook they sing along with me momma
What more they want from me momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
""Don't ever take advice,"" that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone, one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny shit could've gone south for me he looked out for me ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black, and now I'm here and I'm not black enough

Gotta be careful around rolling stones or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me momma
I'm not condoning it momma

Yeah always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas, he ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from acting, I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CD's of my new shit
You be like ""who's this?"" I be like ""me, girl""
You be like ""oh word, true shit?""
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
And car rides made me feel like I was losing it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Like I was average like that
Started drinking way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year, guess
I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year

I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changing, thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
Four-thousand square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and nigga's crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother the season start
And I don't wanna see you end up with nothing
Y'all throw the word, ""Family"" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was coming
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one getting buckets
They put their arm around you, now you becoming the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you
That they can to see where it goes from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action
The haters just bringing me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champú, young pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was popping off, well ain't I?
Way before niggas had they hands out like they doing macarena
But who am I to complain now, I'm still around, they know",30 for 30 Freestyle,2015
