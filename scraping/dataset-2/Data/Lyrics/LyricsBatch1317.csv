Björk,"I see
Who you are
Behind the skin
And the muscles

I see
Who you are now
And when you get older later
I will
See the same girl
Seem so lioness fire heart passionate lover

And afterwards
Later this century
When you and I have become corpses

Let's celebrate now
All this flesh on our bones
Let me push you up against me tightly
And enjoy every bit of you
(missing)

Let's celebrate now
All this flesh on our bones
And enjoy every bit of you

Björk,"I once had no fears
None at all
And then when
I had some

To my surprise
I grew to like both
Scared or brave
Without them

The thrill of fear
Thought I'd never admit it
The thrill of fear
Now greatly enjoyed with courage

When I once was
Untouchable
Innocence roared
Still amazes

When I once was
Innocent
It's still here
But in different places

Neurosis
Only
Attaches
Itself to
Fertile
Ground
Where it can flourish

The thrill of fear
Thought I'd never admit it
The thrill of fear
Now greatly enjoyed with courage

When I once was
Fearless
Innocence roared
Still amazes

Untouchable
Innocence
It's still here
But in different places

Fear is a powerful drug
Overcome it and
You think that you can do
Anything!

Should I
Save myself
For later
Or generously give?

Fear of
Losing
Energy
Is draining

It locks up your chest
Shuts down the heart
Miserly
And stingy
Let's open up : share!

When I once was
Fearless
Innocence roared
Still amazes

Untouchable
Innocence
It's still here
But in different places",Innocence [Simian Mobile Disco 12],2008

Björk,"I am leaving this harbor
Giving urban a farewell
Its habitants seem to keen on God
I cannot stomach their rights and wrongs

I have lost my origin
And I don't want to find it again
Whether sailing into nature's laws
And be held by ocean's paws

Wanderlust! Relentlessly craving
Wanderlust! Peel off the layers
Until we get to the core

Did I imagine it would be like this?
Was it something like this I wished for?
Or will I want more?

Lust for comfort
Suffocates the soul
Relentless restlessness
Liberates me (sets me free)

I feel at home
Whenever the unknown surrounds me
I receive it's embrace
Aboard my floating house

Wanderlust! Relentlessly craving
Wanderlust! Peel off the layers
Until we get to the core

Did I imagine it would be like this?
Was it something like this I wished for?
Or will I want more?

Wanderlust! From island to island
Wanderlust! United in movement
Wonderful! I'm joined with you

Wanderlust!

Can you spot a pattern?

Heaven's bodies

A song that became the world we know

Was a cold black egg, until the God inside
Burst out and from its shattered shell
He made what became the world we know

Was an endless land, until our ancestors
Woke up and before they went back to sleep
They carved it up into the world we know

Crystals grow like plants (listen how they grow)

Björk,"As the lukewarm hands of the Gods
Came down and gently picked my adrenaline pearls
They placed them in their mouths
And rinsed all of the fear out
Nourished them with their saliva

Is being in life threatening circumstances
And once again be reborn

Best way to start the new is to fail miserably
Fail at loving and fail at giving
Fail at creating a flow then realign the whole

Björk,"Stirring at water's edge
Cold froth on my twig
My mind in whirls
Wanders around desire

May I, can I, or have I too often craving miracles
May I, can I, or have I too often now craving miracles
Craving miracles

No one imagines
The light shock I need
And I'll never know
From whose hands deeply humbled
Dangerous gift
As such to mine come

May I, should I, or have I too often craving miracles
May I, can I, or have I too often craving miracles
Craving miracles

My romantic gene is dominant
And it hungers for union
Universal intimacy
All embracing

May I, should I, or have I too often craving miracles
May I, can I, or have I too often craving miracles
Craved

Waves irregularly striking
Wind stern in my face
Thunderstorm come
Scrape those barnacles
Off me

May I, may I or should I too often now crave miracles
May I or should I or have I too often

As lightning hits my spine
Sparkling
Prime runs through me
Revive my wish

Björk,"I shuffle around
The tectonic plates in my chest
You know I gave it all
Trying to match our continents
To change seasonal shift
To form a mutual core

As fast as your fingernail grows
The Atlantic ridge drifts
To counteract distance
You know I gave it all
Can you hear the effort
Of the magnetic strife
Shuffling of columns
To form a mutual core

This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know that I had it in me
Withheld your love, an unspent capsule
I didn't know you had it in you
You hid the key to our continuity

Björk,"Why can't you give her room
Respect her spatial needs
I feel you compress her
Into a small space

With clairvoyance
She knew what you needed
And she gave it to you
Now her desires are repressed
Arrows smooth the flesh

When she found your love
Her nature bowed her head
She surrendered
She renounced the world for you
Now she's poisoned by demands
You cannot answer

Why this sacrifice
Now she regrets the whole thing
A delayed reaction
When she left her craft voluntarily
For your nest, for your love
Did you understand

Appreciate
Build a bridge to her
Initiate a touch
Before it's too late
Say the words to her
That will make her shine
Tell her that you love her

Björk,"When your eyes
Pause on the ball
That hangs on the third branch
From the star
You remember why it is dark
And why it gets light again

The earth like the hearts
Slopes in its seat
And like that it travels
Along an elliptical path
Drawn into the darkness

An unpolished pearl
In the sky black in palm of hand
Flickering sun flame

That you yourself
You are a light bearer, a light bearer
Receiving radiance from others
Flickering sun flame
Unpolished earth in the palm of hand",Solstice,2011

Björk,"We are each other’s hemispheres

I am fine tuning my soul
To the universal wavelength
No one is a lover alone
I propose an atom dance
Our hearts are coral reefs in low tide
Love is the ocean we crave
Restlessly turning around and around
I am dancing towards transformation
Learning by love to open it all
Let this ugly wound relief
We fear unconditional heart space
Healed by atom dance

When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me!
We are each other’s hemispheres

We aim at peeling off dead layers of loveless love
No one is a lover alone
Most hearts fear their own home
Come in themselves fully
It scares them all

When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me!

No one is a lover alone, no one
Most hearts fear their own home

You are my same hemisphere, hemisphere

Lay my flowers
Light the candles

Love is the ocean we crave
Restlessly turning around and around
I am dancing towards transformation
Learning by love to open it up
Let this ugly wound breathe
We fear unconditional heart space
Healed by atom dance

When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me!
We are each other’s hemispheres

We aim at peeling off
Dead layers of loveless love
No one is a lover alone
Most hearts fear their own home
Becoming themselves fully
It scares them off

When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me!

No one is a lover alone
Most hearts fear their own home

You are my second hemisphere, hemisphere
The atoms are dancing, dancing
Atoms are laughing at last
At last",Atom Dance (ft Antony),2015

Björk,"All of my mouth was kissing him
Now, into the air, I am missing him
Is this excess texting a blessing?
Two music nerds obsessing

He reminds me of the love in me
I'm celebrating on a vibrancy
Sending each other MP3s
Falling in love to a song

This handsomest of wickermen
He asked if I could wait for him
Now, how many lightyears this interim
While I fall in love with his songs?

His hands are good in protecting me
Touching and caressing me
But would it be trespassing
Wanting him to be blissing me
Robbing him of his youth?

Cliffhanger-like suspension
My longing has formed its own skeleton
Bridging the gap between singletons
Sending each others these songs

The interior of these melodies
Is perhaps where we are meant to be
Our physical union a fantasy
(I just fell) I just fell in love with a song

So, I reserve my own intimacies
I bundle them up in packages
My rawward longing far too visceral
Did I just fall in love with love?",Blissing Me,2017
Björk,"First snow of Winter
I'm walking hills and valleys
Adore this mystical fog!
This fucking mist!
These cliffs are just showing off

Then the body memory kicks in
I mime my whole mountains
The moss that I'm made of
I redeem myself

I've been wrestling my fate
Do I accept this ending?
Will I accept my death?
Or struggle claustrophobic?
Fought like a wolverine
With my destiny
Refuse to accept what was meant to be

Then the body memory kicks in, and I trust the unknown
Unfathomable imagination
Surrender to future

Oh, how to capture all this love
And find a pathway for it
Like threading an ocean through a needle
Ribbon through a keyhole
Can't fathom the grasp
I can't grasp the fathom

Then the body memory kicks in
My limbs and tongue take over
Like the ancestors before me
Show me the flow

My sexual DNA
X-rays of my Kama Sutras
Summons different bodies
Compares spines and buttocks
And back of necks

Then my body memory kicks in
It simply takes over
Beastiality
I redeem my body

I wasn't born urban
Toxic doesn't agree with me
A love lured me here
Into a stagnant state
My myths, my customs, ridiculed
Vacuum-packed molecules

Then my body memory kicks in
On this Brooklyn dance floor
Sweating with these rhythms
Rotate this matrix

I'm trapped in legal harness
Kafka-esque, farce like patriarchy
Avoid it to confront it

Then the body memory kicks in
My warrior awakens
My turn to defend
Urban didn't tame me

Bosoms and embraces
Oral, anal entrances
Enjoy the satisfaction

We've gone through the grinder, suffered loss
Lost to, to which everything flows, an absence which
Attracts floral blooming softly

Soft is my chest, I didn't allow loss
Loss make me hate, didn't harden from pain
This pain we have will always be there
But the sense of full satisfaction too

I opened my heart for you
Your lower lip so heavy on you
My spine curved erotically
We're finally vulnerable

Loss of love, we all have suffered
How we make up for it defines who we, who we are
It defines us, how we overcome it
Recover, repair from loss

Loss of faith just ignites survivors
They stare doubt straight into the eye
I forgive, the past is bondage
Freedom aphrodisiac (aphrodisiac)

And knows how to get through to the rest of us
She has entered me thousandfold often
And undone knots at my most awkward

She reaches out to orphans and refugees
Embraces them with thermal blankets
Her favourite childhood moments
Were at a hospital for the disabled

Björn Afzelius,"När jag tänker tillbaka på min barndom
Ser jag skräckbilder tydligast av allt
Ja, de gånger de skrämde eller slog mig
Är de minnen som hårdast sitter fast
För som barn tar man kärleken för given;
Allting annat är mot ens natur
I den stund man tar steget ut i livet
Är man bara ett tillgivet djur

Ändå står snart de vuxna där och pekar
Ut den riktning de tycker man skall ta
Alla drömmar de själva har förvägrats
Vill de förverkliga genom sina barn
Är man lydig belönas man och hyllas
Revolterar man mister man allt
Ingen älskar ett barn som inte lyckas
Ingen älskar ett barn som är starkt

Men vem besitter förmågan att veta
Vad som ryms i en ny individ?
Och vem kan säg' till nån annan hur lyckan ser ut
Vem kan säg' vad nån annan vill bli?

Låt dina blommor slå rot där det finns jordmån
Låt dina växter får leva där de trivs
Lås inte in dina plantor i ett drivhus
Låt de få slippa ett onaturligt liv
Låt den du älskar få pröva sina vingar
En dag så flyger din älskade rätt
Vill du bli respekterad av din avbild
Så får du visa din avbild respekt",Ikaros,2009

Like a melody can?

You play like violins in a broken fucking symphony 
And I know this hurts for you you, but I have no fucking sympathy 
Infectious cold, I've spent living with neglect 
Yet I still can't let you go, and I'm still not fucking over it 
I know my suffering's what keeps you alive 
(And I know you fucking love it) 
Six years I fell for this (love) disguised in fucking misery 
My sinking ship, will you be the fucking end of me? 
You breathe only in withered lies, your perversion of distrust 
Now another full-length down and we're still not fucking over this 
And when your eyes become the looking glass, 
Through which only reflect the fucking past 
Conceived in poignant everlasting despair 
You fell in love with the evil that you bare

I can't forgive, I can't forget
This dream was ours, but you ripped it to shreds!
There's no escape, I can't reflect
The distance kills me, but your presence's a threat!

You traded everything for a life of broken promises 
At 23, I've fallen out when you left me with this bitterness 
A frame of glass, and a love that's built on sorrow 
Is a see-through coffin for a heart that beats so hollow 
I know this eats you alive 
That which doesn't kill you just fucks with your mind

Out of place and you turned away, 
Leaving nothing but the mess that you made  (Mess you made!)

For too long I have lived just another slave bound by your torment 
But I am not afraid anymore 
I am not your fucking puppet!
The snow has turned to rain, and now I hope you're fucking happy

Leaving nothing but the mess that you made (Mess you made!)

Six years I fell for this dead look on your face 
When the rain has washed away, what will be underneath? 
A midnight breeze of chilled unease, when we began amiss 
The taunting scent of autumn makes a scornful heart resist 
A longing bliss in carnal stints of thighs gracing betwixt your hips 
The harvest moon drapes aloft these graven, tattered crypts 
Please, just let me let you go 
And kiss this life from my lips 
To show me a love not even death can resist 
Move! I am the boy with a thorn in his side! 
And I'm still not fucking over it",Puppets 2 (The Rain),2012
Björn Strid,"It swept across the sky 
That early morning
And my hollow eyes went blind
No time for yearning

Can’t keep wondering what I did to rely
On burdens carried by others
Now let me steer this ship until I die

You’ve burned it all this time
Your machine is in fear
From the day you were born

Born!
Now you hear my call, I'm falling
Falling all the way
If you turn to me while crawling
To the place of secret ways
Do you hear the call I’m longing?
For a place with distant waves

We turned our backs on the truth
Never deserving
Of the moments we had shared
Caught in a whirlwind
I saw it in your eyes
I knew we’d reached the point
We couldn’t ever look back 
We’ve learned the ways of wrath

Can’t keep wondering what I did to rely
On burdens carried by others
Now let me steer this ship until I die
Til’ I die

Now you hear my call, I'm falling
Falling all the way
If you turn to me while crawling
To the place of secret ways
Do you hear the call I’m longing
For a place with distant waves

Att se ett segel ligga still

Det är då jag känner jag finns till
Att finnas till - det är att njuta stunder
Att finnas till - det är så stort för mig
Finnas till - det är ett herrens under
Att finnas till - det är att va' med dig!

med den vän man håller kärast,
kanske läppja ett glas vin
Att finnas till då för varann
medan staden redan sover,
kanske tända stearin

från den man älskar - sådant vill

Really hurt me baby, really hurt me baby
How can have a day without a night
You're the book that I have opened
And now I've got to know much more

The curiousness of your potential kiss

That love is blind and your heart will not grow old

I hate to tell you, I hate to cry

Got love for me, and the way I put it down
Smokin mad treats when I'm off in your town

Niggaz don't understand, they love the way I rhyme
As I crown, Billboard charts lett em know
At the same time niggaz hatin my flow
Who rock the ice, Cuban cigars
Never knew one day I'd be chillin with the stars
Fancy cars, free drinks by the spas
Smoking out,niggaz  chillin in the spas
My whole crew, in the manli? keys
what's my name, Blac Haze and merciless g's
Made niggaz, floss the e-class
Always knew one day I'd see cash
Comin up all the way to the top
Betta this thang and rock (come on)

[Chorus] 2x

Party over here it ain't over there throw yo hands up in the air
 Get on down get on down, get on down get on down,

I'm a hustler, not by choice (1x)

[AZ]
I didn't fall from heaven, I rose from hell
Bigboy, get bagged, he gon' hold my bail
It's like Attica '67 when they, closed the jail
Be careful, but promote yo'selves that's what they told me
Involved but unconcerned fuck beef when it dissolve it does not return
I don't leave, stagnate nor move off-beat
So discrete very rarely do I move on feet
I rough-ride twin rugers on the sides of my seats
Drive-by's, bodies left on both sides of the streets
I blacks out never blind by the size of the image
No disguise, homocide don't rely forensic
Homes's finished, scrambling caught in the scrimmage
12 shells ricocheting and it pours from the hemorrhage
Get the casket embalm and forget the bastard for moving backwards
New York's number one draft pick

I'm a hustler, not by choice (4x)

[Trav]
All this nigga know is, get money burn a lot of smokes
Lazy niggas was sleeping, I was wide awoke
Not a joke, creep on snitches, niggas gotta choke
When it's time to sleep with the fishes I supply the boat
And I swear it hurts, I supply the coke
'cause don't nothing scare me worse than dying broke
Iron poking on my ribs while I'm laying in a Taurus
I live this shit y'all just performers, it's a dirty game
I seen thugs turn informers, crooked cops run in the crib, no warrants
Money talk though, never stuck in a grudge,
Got a female lawyer and she fucking the judge
I was once told, that you reap what you sow
And a, the scent of weed always seep in your clothes
And a, it's Quiet Money so we speaking in codes
Like, why should I trust ya?, nigga, I'm a hustler

I'm a hustler, not by choice (4x)

[Animal]
Unh, Yo, Jesus Christ yo, he just nice
Like a ginszu blade nigga, he just slice
And get y'all out the game, dog, it's not long
Anybody can spit, faggot, but can you make a hot song?
You're not wrong, like Biggie said you're dead wrong
Need to get your flow tight, gotta get your head strong
Watch us, the way we floss up in coat lockers
Walk right past security, flippin' poppers
Like what? who the fuck gon' stop us?
y'all wait until the summer, when this fucking album drop us
I know y'all hate it, because y'all flows outdated
You finished as an artist and I finally made it
But I paid my dues, in this game patiently waited
Niggas ain't gimme shit, I had to take it
It's A dot, all year 'round I stay hot
Nigga I play not, ride through you're block in that grey drop
They call me headhunter, the head is all I aim for
The top spot nigga, what you think I came for?
These words touch you, cut you open like a chainsaw
And now you're your man is like, what y'all said his name for?
Fucking hustler, motherfucking Animal

Suns at half mast 'cause masses ain't aglow
On bended knee, prostrate before an altered tree
I've made the forest suit me
Tables and chairs
Papers and prayers
Matter versus spirit
A metal ladder
A wooden cross
A plastic bottle of water
A mandala encased in glass
A spirit encased in flesh
Sound from shaped hollows
The thickest of mucus released from heightened passion
A man that cries in his sleep
A truth that has gone out of fashion
A mode of expression
A paint splattered wall
A carton of cigarettes
A bouquet of corpses
A dying forest
A nurtured garden
A privatized prison
A candle with a broken wick
A puddle that reflects the sun
A piece of paper with my name on it
I'm surrounded
I surrender
All
All that I am I have been
All I have been has been a long time coming
I am becoming all that I am
The spittle that surrounds the mouth-piece of the flute
Unheard, yet felt
A gathered wetness
A quiet moisture
Sound trapped in a bubble
Released into wind
Wind fellows and land merchants
We are history's detergent
Water soluble, light particles, articles of cleansing breath
Articles amending death
These words are not tools of communication
They are shards of metal
Dropped from eight story windows
They are waterfalls and gas leaks
Aged thoughts rolled in tobacco leaf
The tools of a trade
Barbers barred, barred of barters
Catch phrases and misunderstandings
But they are not what I feel when I am alone
Surrounded by everything and nothing
And there isn't a word or phrase to be caught
A verse to be recited
A man to de-fill my being in those moments
I am blankness, the contained center of an ""O""
The pyramidic containment of an ""A""
I stand in the middle of all that I have learned
All that I have memorized
All that I've known by heart
Unable to reach any of it
There is no sadness
There is no bliss
It is a forgotten memory
A memorable escape route that only is found by not looking
There, in the spine of the dictionary the words are worthless
They are a mere weight pressing against my thoughtlessness
But then, who else can speak of thoughtlessness with such confidence
Who else has learned to sling these ancient ideas
Like dead rats held by their tails
So as not to infect this newly oiled skin
I can think of nothing heavier than an airplane
I can think of no greater conglomerate of steel and metal
I can think of nothing less likely to fly
There are no wings more weighted
I too have felt a heaviness
The stare of man guessing at my being
Yes I am homeless
A homeless man making offerings to the after-future
Sculpting rubber tree forests out of worn tires and shoe soles
A nation unified in exhale
A cloud of smoke
A native pipe ceremony
All the gathered cigarette butts piled in heaps
Snow covered mountains
Lipsticks smeared and shriveled
Offerings to an afterworld
Tattoo guns and plastic wrappers
Broken zippers and dead eyed dolls
It's all overwhelming me, oak and elming me
I have seeded a forest of myself
Little books from tall trees
It matters not what this paper be made of
Give me notebooks made of human flesh
Dried on steel hooks and nooses
Make uses of use, uses of us
It's all overwhelming me, oak and elming me
I have seeded a forest of myself
Little books from tall trees
On bended knee
Prostrate before an altered tree

Of your pink and sleepy eyelids;

Grow more foolish than we can ever guess.

And you hope the answer's ""no"", the answer's ""yes"".

My love and I lay down
Just above 42nd Street
While the rain was pouring down

When I covered her with kisses
The sparks lit up her eyes
We made love like mad angels
While the Jersey trucks rolled by

She said, ""Don't you ever leave me
Oh, for god sake don't let me down""
So I made her all kinds of promises
About how I'd always be around

But the speed was rippin' through my head
I'd only one thing on my mind
So goodbye my love on 42nd street
If I don't get out of here, I'm gonna die

On the banks of the Hudson
My love and I lay down
Just one more midnight left to kill
Then I'm outta New York town

I could feel the ice man closin' in
I could almost smell his gun
But that 20 grand I beat him out of
Would help me start again back home

And she said, ""Don't you ever leave me
Oh, for god sake don't let me down
Then I thought about what they'd do to her
When they found out I'd left town

But the fire was racin' through my brain
I'd only one thing on my mind
So goodbye my love on 42nd Street
If I don't get out of here, I'm gonna die

Don't say I should have stayed with her
You don't know the full story about the girl
I only used her just as much as she used me
But sometimes you just gotta get out of New York City

On the banks of the Hudson

Just above 42nd street
While the rain was pouring down

When I covered her with kisses
The sparks lit up her eyes
We made love like mad angels
While the Jersey trucks rolled by

And she said, ""Don't you ever leave me
Oh, for god sake don't let me down""
But how could I ever take
A black girl back to Wexford town

Just then the streets of fire turned to blood
A yellow Cadillac cruised by
And as I raced up 42nd Street
The ice man shouted, ""Hey Paddy, it's time to die""

It's time to
It's time to
It's time to

Just to show you I was right all along

Yeah, we cut a song about Avenue B
And the boxes boomed it all over the streets
But the record company had us screwed us all up
And Sheila went off and joined the scientology church

Then Mike stopped a bullet in Staten Island
And my whole world turned ultra violent
But there's one last thing I just gotta see through
There's one last thing I gotta say to you

Sheila, baby, give me one more chance
I've just gone and formed Black '47
I don't care about the money and you can keep the fame
I just wanna beat this city at its own dumb game

New York, New York what have you done?
You've wrecked me 'til I have become
Half the man I might have been
Half the hero of my dream

New York, New York it's over now
You beat me still I know somehow
Just for once I'm gonna prove you wrong
Just to show you I was right all along

Black 47,"I got a job in a band called Black 47 
I was doin' nothin' special after 11 
Oh we learned some tunes and wrote some songs 
And we bought ourselves a drum machine to keep the beat strong 

Well we bought the Irish People, the Echo and the Voice 
And we rang a few bars, said ""we got a new noise 
Hey, it would please us greatly to come on uptown 
And show you Paddys how we get on down"" 

One o'clock, two o'clock, give us a chance 
All we wanta do is be rockin' the Bronx 
3 o'clock, 4 o'clock what does she want 
The girl in black leather wants to 

Rocka the - rocka the - rocka the - rocka the Bronx 
Oh we got a gig in the Village Pub 
But the regulars there all said that we sucked 
Then Big John Flynn, said ""oh, no no 

You'll be causin' a riot if I don't let you go"" 
Then a flintstone from the Phoenix gave us a call 
When he heard the beat, he was quite appalled 
""D'yez not know nothin' by Christy Moore?"" 

The next thing you be wantin' is Danny Boy! Chris is chillin' on the uilleann but he isn't alone 
Here comes Freddy on the slide trombone 
Add a little guitar, Geoff Blythe on the sax 
Gonna shoot you full of our New York fix 

Then we went into the studio and made a tape 
Frank Murray from the Pogues said ""I think that it's great 
Galigula said ""it could be a hit"" 
And if it falls on its face, who gives a shit!"" 

Now everywhere we go we cause a fuss 
'Cause we play what we like and our sound is us 
It's got a whole lot of hell and a little bit of heaven 
That's the story so far of Black 47",Rockin' the Bronx [Album Version],1993
Black 47,"Open up the door, she's standin' there 
With the smile in her eyes but the grey in her hair 
Betrays the fact you strayed far from home
With your drinkin', your smokin', your whorin' around 
Sit down by the fire, put your feet on the grate 
Spend the night reminiscin' 'til the hour grows late 
Always remember at the end of the day...
You can always go home... You just can't stay.

Then it's off to the pub for to see your old mates 
Ah, they all look older, but nothin' has changed 
And you drink 'til you're nearly out of your head 
""Hey, what are ya's all doin' snakin' off to bed?"" 
Then you're outside her flat but she's no longer there 
And the tears scald your eyes as you think of her hair 
In the photo they sent you of her wedding day 
You can always go home... You just can't stay. 

Then you see her at mass with the kids at her side 
And it all comes back in the blink of an eye 
The tears and the laughter, the love and the lies 
And that dress she wore the night you said goodbye 
Then her husband says ""it's good to have you back"" 
And she smiles for a moment and squeezes your hand 
But you know what she's thinkin', she doesn't have to say 
You can always go home... You just can't stay. 

And you swear to yourself time and time again 
It was all in the past, she don't mean anything 
Now your life is full of laughter and bars 
What did you leave behind, just the sun... The moon... And the stars. 
Then it's up in the mornin' at the crack of dawn 
With your stomach churnin', she says ""C'mon now Sean, 
You'll be late for the plane,"" but that crack in her voice 
Betrays the fact that you made your choice 
A long time ago, now there's no turnin' back 
'Cause last night you had your American wake 
And the bells are still ringin', can't you hear what they say 
You can always go home... You just can't stay.

Say goodbye 
Say goodybe
Say goodbye, in the wind and the pourin' rain...

One last drink
One last drink at Shannon airport, then you're outta here, 
History around here, catch you again next year...

Nothin' ever got this good brother down He was a real live wire in an electric town 
Frankie started hangin' with an uptown girl 
A Harlem lady in the social whirl
On Saturday night he'd put on his best clothes 
And go out steppin' with his Black Rose
Now Frankie went upstate for a couple of years
A guest of the nation and he was in tears 
He called me up, he said ""hey friend of mine I got one favor to ask you while I'm doin' my time She's the Queen of New York City 
She bewitch all men soul 
She the blood that flow right through me So don't be messin' with my Black Rose 
Keep your hands off my Black Rose"" My Black Rose, he don't own ya... 
While Frankie was upstate, his Harlem girl 
Continued to spiral in her social whirl 
So I paged her from my gig on East 7th I said, 
""Hey, babe, you doin' anythin' round about 11?""
She said ""Uh-uh"" in her uptown voice 
So we met at Beiruit for cocktails and ice 
When she crossed that room in her tight red dress 
I wasn't thinkin' of Frankie, I have to confess
She said ""hey, best friend, let's go back to my place I need to fix my mascara and remodel my face"" 
But it rained on the way back to her house 
And when she closed the door she took off her blouse 
She's the Queen of New York City
She bewitch all men soul Next thing I know I'm whisperin' sweet nothin's Lyin' in bed with my Black Rose I'm makin' love to my Black.. 
My Black Rose, he don't own ya 
So stay with me tonight...
At nights I'd lie there and listen to her breathe
With the sweat on my brow, how could she sleep

So deep, so sweet as calm as a rock 
While I pushed back the seconds oozing from the clock
Now the letters I wrote Frankie returned unread 
The word leaked out I'd be better off dead 
But in the crimson dawn, Black Rose would unfold 
And drain all the poison from my soul 
Now I'm standin' up here on forty deuce
Another terminal man waitin' for his bus
Here come Frankie with his head all shaved
Is that a piece in his pocket, or is it a blade 
Now I'm lyin' face down in the terminal dirt 
With a hole in my chest, but I don't feel no hurt I don't wanta go to heaven, I been there before 
Just spent two years in paradise with my Black Rose 
She's the Queen of New York City 
She bewitch all men soul
When you go and find her body 
Bury me next to my Black Rose 
Still in love with my Black Rose 
She's up in heaven now, my Black Rose 
You won't be makin' love to my Black...
My Black Rose, he don't own ya... 
So stay with me tonight, for the rest of your life 
Roisin dubh, me no can get over you
A time is in me mind no matter what I do 
Roisin dubh me no can get over you
Now Frankie comin' back and I know that I am through 
Mister Frankie Diamond tell me do the right thing 
Watch his girl while he away at Sing Sing
But me and Rosie, we have a little fling 
Now Frankie comin' home, wicked trouble it will bring

I was stabbed and I was spat upon
My family run out of its home
There was only one solution
Turn the whole system upside down

But the system had other ideas
I got lifted for carryin' a gun
In a trial without a jury
I got fourteen years from the judge

Screws beat me regularly
But they couldn't break me because
I had the love of my comrades
And a burnin' faith in my cause

Still I left a girl outside pregnant
Married her while on remand

To break on out oh, oh, oh, oh

So they stripped us to the bone
Threw in some threadbare blankets
And when they jeered us about our nakedness
As we slopped out down the halls
We wouldn't come out of their prison cells
We smeared shit on their prison walls

Stuck in an eight foot concrete box
With a Bible, a mattress
And the threat of violence everyday
Can I make it through these fourteen years?
Will my son remember my face?
I don't blame her for the separation
But for Christ's sake let him keep his name

when i landed in slovakia, i drank a dozen pints
but when i caught a glimpse of gertie i nearly died of fright
she was 6 feet in her stockings, she viewed me with dismay
""is this the best they can do for me in the dear old usa?""

but despite me splittin' headache, i wooed her like a man
and very soon thereafter we were married in prague
i remembered boris' pistol and me vow of chastity
but when she pinned me to the bed that night, i gave upinstantly..

bright and early next mornin' i went to see the pope in rome
gertie left for america, make new york her home
she landed down on avenue be	 lookin' for a mansion grand
boris was drunk, the building stunk, the city was mad
she'd been had,
this was the height of depravity - not what she'd seen onmtv...

i wasn't farin' much better with the holy father in rome
some turkish wiseguy whacked him and he wasn't even at home
so i landed back in new york oh so sad
stared down the barrel of boris's gun, jeez was he ever mad
he accused me of buggerin' his daughter but to make mattersworse
she'd spent over 20 grand in macys and in saks
she sat there in her underwear, gave me a dirty wink
but when i thought about the credit cards me love began toshrink

so we drove her out to kennedy 14 trunks and all
and we said a prayer for the holy father back in rome
but as her plane rose over rockaway, boris he said to me
""would you ever go over to czechoslovakia and marry me daughterfor me...""

When the Doors were ridin' on the storm, Hendrix was alive
And before I could blink an eye, I was sent to Vietnam
To teach them people democracy

'Twas your eyes of emerald green

I learned to smoke the opium pipe, I learned it all too well
'Cause when the shells are bangin' in your ears

It stops that livin' hell
Then one night 6 months later
While in the DMZ
Me own dear U.S. Air Force blew the hell right out of me

Still I loved my country 
I saluted the old flag
When you're a boy from Woodside, Queens
You give it all you have

'Cause I knew you'd be there waitin' 
With your eyes of emerald green
My love is in New York and she's the only one for me
But when I got sent home at last, they jeered and spat at me

They called me a fascist, said I was the enemy
I could've put up with all of that
'Twas no big thing to me
But you killed me with one look of disgust

From those emerald greens
Now I sit down here on Broadway, this pavement is me home
The war is long forgotten, for those who stayed at home
And I wish I had me opium pipe 

To stop that livin' hell
That's goin' on inside me head, I wish it all so well
And the Doors still ride by on the storm
Hendrix hides from Joe

I should be history around here but where else is there to go

So I bought a cheap guitar, I learned to write me poetry 
And me and rock and roll set off to see the country 
Oh we played in pubs and dancehalls, we even played in brothels I learned all about the good life through the ass end of a bottle
I learned about love from many's the fine lady
But I was always searchin' for me one true darlin' baby 
Oh I searched from coast to coast from Florida to Canada
With me heart upon me sleeve screamin' out ""hi, where are yeh"" 
'Til I went home with a six foot girl from the south side of Chicago
But it turned out she was a man, oh can you imagine the disaster? 
But the sweetest girl of all was from the state of California 
Ah she took me home to bed, kept me rockin til the mornin' 
Then the door came crashin' in, in the midst of me shenanigans

Black 47,"Six months out on the road
Don't know if I'm ever goin' home
Out there in the middle of America
Out of my head, feelin' hysterical

Wishin' I was back in New York
Playin' in Reilly's on a Saturday night
Man on the phone says. ""I ain't jokin'""
Would yes ever come and play for us out in Hoboken?""

So we hop in the van and we drive overnight
Goin' to sweet New Jersey, startin' to feel alright
But the word is out that the boys are back in town
30,000 Paddies start gettin' on down

When we hit the stage, police chief goes nuts
What the hell am I gonna do with 30,000 drunks
He say, ""Stop the music, I'm in charge""
Then he goes and he shut down all of the bars

I don't care if you got the blues
Just keep the hell off my green suede shoes
You can do anything you choose
But don't go messin' up my green suede, green suede shoes

Then we're comin' from Providence late one night
3 hours from home, hey life is alright
We're discussin' the demise of T Rex
Next thing we know the van is up on its ass

The windows are smashed, we're bouncin' off the Turnpike
The troopers come and haul us off the black ice
One says, ""Hi, my name is Kevin
It's a pleasure to meet you, Black 47""

So we're doin' Letterman, Leno and O'Brien
200 gigs a year and I'm outa my mind
We got our picture in Time Magazine
Hey, babe, I'm livin' the American Dream

Then a lawyer called up about Bridie and the baby
Wants to sue my ass for doin' the Funky Ceili
And I just got a message from a brother of Maria
""c'mon out to Bensonhurst, we all want a piece of ya""

I don't care if you got the blues
Just keep the hell off my green suede shoes
You can do anything you choose
But don't go messin' up my green suede, green suede shoes

But the more I play the deeper I'm in debt
If we ever get a hit, I'll be out on the street
I never knew I had so many friends
I'm gonna run against Rudy when this whole thing ends

I got lawyers and accountants up the kazoo
Managers and agents tellin' me what to do
With the money I'm eventually gonna make
But can you loan me a token, get me to the next gig

I don't care if you got the blues
Just keep the hell off my green suede shoes
You can do anything you choose
But don't go messin' up my green suede, green suede shoes

Take of those shoes baby
Look out now

In a world do heartless
We are livin' in blindness, in blindness yeah

No matter how ya come
Cross the wrong path then you will get done

Ain't no love just pain
No sun only rain
Had a big effect on a young brother's brain
It's time ton initiate
No place to be
Figure in order to get up 
Ya got come straight
To the niggas
Yeah
And pass the test
Ya gotta show those mother fuckers that you're heartless
Slap the clip in the nine
Ya jump in the ride
Headed straight down for McCartha drive

Ya pull-ups low
Hit the lights down low
Hopin' ya don't see nobody ya know
Not knowing what to do to impress the crew
Ya see a little old lady about 62
Bla, bla blasted that ass
The bitch is under the ground
Ya put your foot to the gas
And haul ass
Straight up to seem
Crass pitchin' hard with a gangster Lee

[Chorus]
 
At the age of 21
A criminal at it's peak
Just walkin' down the street still is trouble I see
Gramblin, girls, go
It's all for fun
Got my boy AC to do a small run
Dreaming' of vice
Cold-blooded and nice
You may see me once, but never twice
Wait a minute
This ain't no dream
It's the heartless life
Floor it
And it's all about the dream

Do what I mean and mean what I say
But don't try to be like no toy
'Cause I'm not for play
And if it's trouble you see
Then see used for fine
Death in a twine
With a criminal mind
Thugs and drugs
And niggas who take slugs
Me and state colder than a bug in a rug
The things I do and the things I say
Make it hard on me
To live another day",Heartless,1999

I didn't want anything more to do with the outside world
I was happy being quiet

From speech therapists to child psychologists
They even tried bribery
I could have anything
As long as I said it out loud

Life is unfair, kill yourself or get over it
Life is unfair, kill yourself or get over it

Of course this episode didn't last forever
I'd made my point and it was time to move on
To peel away the next layer of deceit
And see what new surprises lay in store
My school report said I showed no interest
""A disruptive influence""
I felt sorry for them in a way
And when they finally expelled me
It didn't mean a thing

The Christmas decorations were already up
Spray on snow, coloured flashing lights
And an artificial tree that played Silent Night

Normal, happy childhood back on course

Hey, Hey Once a good girl gone bad She's gone forever 
Prolly with me enjoying California weather 
Hey Mami, we belong together 
Like the white and yellow stones 
That set into the prom together 
And now a girl get into a stressed out mood 
And go bad faster than left out food 
They say it's the lazy flow the shorties love 
It drive 'em crazy though, like Courtney Love 
I keep a bad one that also's a good cook 
5th Ave. classy mixed with the hood look 
And my good look them bad for yo health 
And everybody know you can do bad by yourself, girl

Maybe I took for granted you'd be around

To pick me up on my way down

I thought my feet were planted firmly on the ground

Till one day my whole world came unwound

Like a ball of yarn kept neatly on a spool

You held the life together of this broken hearted fool

And what once was the exception... now seems to be the rule


And there's a burnin' question a fire in my mind

You always had the answers to the ones I couldn't find

So all I'm askin' is

Where are you now


What father time would sell me I'd take it all

If only you'd be back around


But better times expel me who am I to take the call

But there's no way of knowin' where I'm bound

So here it comes another fine mess I've gotten to

And if I knew which way to turn I'd still turn to you

So if everything is said and done what am I supposed to do


That's the burnin' question on the fire in my mind

You always had the answers for me time after time

So all I'm askin' is

Where are you now

All I'm askin' is

Where are you now

Been a hard day
It ain't nuttin' but a war poppin' off in the hood

What's really going on?

What really goes on when you can't hold on
It's so wrong when the love is gone

Mashin', I'm laughin' off da petty
Eyes heavy, puffin my resi, God help me
Can y'all tell me something this good?
Now it's Black Caesar bumpin' in the hood
Peace to Tacktown, clowns, where you at now?
Fools is ready to lay the smack down
I just lay this bomb ass rap down

True Armageddon thugs, hear the spray, heaven's love
They might try to lace us with seven slugs
Word, 'cause the truth up in my sentence
How we gon' send shit on sunny days of independence?
Witness how my game goes, don't play no's
Who think my game low 'cause we rockin' the same clothes
Relax and flame ol' bud while 2-0-6 bend
My click's in, thoughts, they summon up Egyptians
Mixed in with the thug pact
But them same thugs that gave you love back, put scherm in your bud sack
They got your ass wet, wit Teks
Took your last breath, open your chest, now put you past flesh
Why's that? Blacks train to kill they own kind
I'm goin', why? Fit this tap up on momma's phone line
Crime infested ghetto, rats and roaches
Fools act loc and go get the gas to roll wit

Hey suppose you was chose to blossom like a rose
Flossin' on Vogues, everything was solid gold
Hitti'n cruise control, everybody lose control
Peep game like Keith, man, I be the most beautiful
Special with K-ajun celebration
Black is radiance, from Wes Craven, get your chest caved in
Black Jesus, crews, Cadillac and Mac divas
Hot like Gallactica, so what's happenin'? What?
More streetwiser than Kaiser Sosa, no way, Jose
Can you fuck with my hustle forte
It's more ways than one, more than a hundred and one dalmatians
Better get with this gang affiliation
Pain, you're really facin', you ain't bein' your brother's keeper
How long does it take for love to reach ya?
Too late, you in a deep sleeper, the Grim Reaper creeper
We just lay in the cut, blazin' it up (Bitch)

[Chorus: x2]

I'm hollerin' bout peace while y'all increase the crime rate
Rats smackin' on blind dates, homey lost in a mind state
Up to Grind Lake, well this smoker's bangin' for deals
Juli school him on life, try to tell him heaven is real
But ?????? still, they mischemin' the creeper
Black Caesar blaze a sack, gave em daps, hold on that Jesus
We just in this rollercoaster, a soldier toaster
Left the little locs a-dead on the sofa, the drama's closer
If momma choke up, bet this what the game is worth
Explain the pain, it hurts, bendin' the niggas since I came to Earth
Slang some work and makin' money dat the Gz earn
Rookies digest the process slow as my trees burn
See's, Worm and Juli heat up the climate
I'm that one shinin', reflectin' off Willie's diamond
Designin' hoods, crept on without the Teflon
This plain resident left Georgia early like Stefan
Got chrome by the ozones
The homies pluggin' me wit two 50's, take it wit me and see what goes on
What goes on

As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Were his only audience

Hear the cracking of the whips
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming

With some fine young handsome man

Bootlegged whiskey in his hand

Black Cat Orchestra,"The door it opened slowly, 
My father he came in, 
I was nine years old. 
And he stood so tall above me, 
His blue eyes they were shining 
And his voice was very cold. 
He said, ""I've had a vision 
And you know I'm strong and holy, 
I must do what I've been told."" 
So he started up the mountain, 
I was running, he was walking, 
And his axe was made of gold. 
Well, the trees they got much smaller, 
The lake a lady's mirror, 
We stopped to drink some wine. 
Then he threw the bottle over. 
Broke a minute later 
And he put his hand on mine. 
Thought I saw an eagle 
But it might have been a vulture, 
I never could decide. 
Then my father built an altar, 
He looked once behind his shoulder, 
He knew I would not hide. 

You who build these altars now 
To sacrifice these children, 
You must not do it anymore. 
A scheme is not a vision 
And you never have been tempted 
By a demon or a god. 
You who stand above them now, 
Your hatchets blunt and bloody, 
You were not there before, 
When I lay upon a mountain 
And my father's hand was trembling 
With the beauty of the word. 

And if you call me brother now, 
Forgive me if I inquire, 
""Just according to whose plan?"" 
When it all comes down to dust 
I will kill you if I must, 
I will help you if I can. 
When it all comes down to dust 
I will help you if I must, 
I will kill you if I can.

Y'all know who the fuck this is
You know we would kidnap yo kids
You know what the fuck we do
Murder bitch niggas like you
For real, all the time, any place, anywhere
Y'all niggas could get it
Act like y'all don't know

In a world that's ice cold, blacks die slowly
Cats snatch rollies, gats'll leave you holy
My momma always told me the streets will slow me down
Daddy never showed me how the heat will hold me down
So now I rob and steal, spit shit you feel, wit a clique that kills
Yea my shit's that real, I hustle hard all my life
Ran the streets all night
My wife always said everything was gonna be aight
And she was right and that's one reason why I love her
But everything she said went in one ear and out the other
Word to mother, look at it from a thug point of view
When the kids need clothes, what a thug gon do?
Hit the streets and hustle, pick up the heat and bust you
I'm tryin' to eat like Russel
Murda is my hustle But you keep chasin' yesterday, you goin' miss tomorrow
It's murda motherfucker we don't beg or borrow
We take shit, fuck you and yo fake bitch, when the eight (.8mm) spit
You could feel the hatred, taste it
You high right now, you ain't ready to die right now
The .45 will calm you down, you under trauma now
It's drama how a child will shut shit down
Kill a nigga for the fuck of it I get you touched for chips
Fuck that shit, fuck the whip, and fuck you bitch
You can just suck my dick

If you chasin' yesterday, you goin' miss tomorrow
It's murda motherfucker, we don't beg or borrow
We take shit, fuck you and yo fake bitch
When the .8 spit you could feel the hatred, taste it
It's your blood, when we show blood, we murderers (murderers)
We throw slugs, we hustlers (hustlers) we sell drugs
And tell thugs live it up till yo time stops

Yo I give a fuck if y'all niggas hate me
I drop bodies off where the lakes be
But lately, I've been hittin' cribs
And safes where the cake be
I take three to the vest for the love of the dolla
I put that hot shit through you and watch you Holla Holla
The same niggas that I ball wit I'ma brawl wit
I'm a tank running in banks and takin' all of it
Player we're flawless, wit nothin' to lose guns bustin'
And brossen niggas y'all can't live
Funny shit about it, niggas wanna hit me, forget about it
Thug shit I'm still livin' y'all niggas just spit about it
I rob and stomp niggas 2/3rd of my life
The other 1/3 spent sittin' on curbs chasin' those birds
If you ever get the urge to come by and try to test
There's only one and then you get numb and lied to rest
It's murder the only code to the ghetto
It's murder, nigga hand me the Bessel
And dance with the devil, guns rapidly spit
Gangsta shit, attractin yo bitch, gettin head and lean back in the whip
I mastered the chips, Nigga I'm tryin to tell you
You're holdin hammers and nails and
We have you where the dogs couldn't smell you

If you chasin' yesterday, you goin' miss tomorrow
It's murda motherfucker, we don't beg or borrow

Any nigga think not, I'ma pop him
Put the lean on niggas the minute I spot em
Who's gettin' it, I got him nigga dead and gone
Gonna guide em to the cross roads show em how those guns blow
I'ma degenerate nigga addicted to hydro, switchin' four lanes
Top down wit my eyes closed, got a death wish
Money, drugs, and murderer shit
What you want with this? We'll kidnap yo kids
And clap up yo crib, It's the murderers
Who you know wit guns that kill shit
Just because we're them hot niggas
Sell mo records than Roc niggas
I'ma lock it down for six months and shock niggas
What's my name?
J the A R.U.L.E. with them hoes get between more sheets than Isley
You can't deny me, I'm the motherfuckin' one
Druggin' bitches like Heron(heroin)
The god be the Rule, if you're hot get bice and bice

Black Child,"Black Child
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
You know me, y'all don't know me?
Let me tell you a lil' something about me
How I came up
Where I came from
Ahhight?
This is how it all set it off...like this

[Black Child]
I was the black baby that got opened off a black three-eighty
This black lady, in a black Mercedes
Pulled out on this black man, in the black land
He used to sell white rocks, and black cops used to riff
White cops ain't say shit, on the day shift they sniffed
I was a little nigga, with little niggas that like to steal
Then blew up to bigger niggas, that love to kill
Rock Hilfiger sheilds and vests laced in our 'getts
A bounce in the bubble bullet proof G.S.
Of the Ac' NSX with a mack ten express
Or my Q-4-5 with two new four-fifths
I'm into cars and guns I keep a gun in my whip
Nigga, me without my gat is like being in a blue Benz
Infront'a thousand bloods with mac tens
Or a red rose infront'a thousand crips with Calico's
And lord knows, we lust hoes

Chours: Black Child
I don't give a fuck if you white of black
If you bust your gat, I can relate to that
If you sell coke or crack I relate to that
If you do sticks and stacks I can relate to that
I don't give a fuck if you white of black
If you bust your gat, I can relate to that
If you sell coke or crack I relate to that
When its yo' turn to blow there ain't no turning back

[Black Child]
It seem like in anotha lifetime I used to sniff white lines
Commit white collar crimes, and hit white dollar dimes
This one white bitch in the white Benz used to fuck white men
And like to sniff white heroin, I sold china white crack back then
As I was writin this rhyme on white paper with a black pen
I started wonderin how life woulda been
If a nigga like me was born with white skin
I wouldn't have got knocked by the white cops with the white rocks
Coming through in the new blue drop
I be able to floss white gold, and toss white hoes
Shittin in the white Rolls Royce
Hittin a caucasian chickens that sing with a black girls voice
But I love being black, a thug bustin my mack
I know if I was white I wouldn't like that
Or love my gat, or play the clubs where the dubs at
But truthfully you could be blue to me
As long as your cream is green that beautifully
Exclusively, its me and Irv Gotti
And Murder I-N-see here to body everybody

Chorus
[Black Child]
(A MURDA'RA) always got a plan
(A BITCH NIGGA) is a poor excuse for a man
Playas play to win and learn to listen, and listen to learn
(A LAME NIGGA) await his turn to talk
And won't catch ?near jewels? that need to be caught
Niggas know shit that's difficult is possible
A playa pull out and put ya ass in the hospital
For thinkin the possible is impossible
This is ghetto gospel, we gotta politic
Riot quick, pull out the guns and body shit
I don't give a fuck who you go and get
Its Black Child motherfucka, who you fuckin with?
Its MURDAAAA

Chorus",I Can Relate,1999
Black Child,"[Chorus: x2]

Sure if your favorite is long (get it get it) baby baby 
Don't you want to leave tonight and fuck wit me 
'cause we really need to be freakin' off at any cost 
Its on me, if you married, then get a divorce 
When I hits it, some women get twisted 
Have 'em twitchin', like ""damn look what the dick did"" 
I just want to hit it the worst way, right after a long day 
And put the puss on lay-a-way, heard me? 
I'm that, dirty nigga that get you hot, and heat it 
Baby girl if you wanted ass, why don't you eat it? 

[Chorus: x2]

Let me holla at my true thugs 
If niggas want war, bust slugs 
Nigga, what? I'm hotta hotta and just can't be touched 
Plus anybody that fucks wit me, gonna get felt 
How many want it? determines how the slugs get dealt 
'cause I split em split em
Choke then niggas like roaches and then (clip em clip em) 
Long as I'm alive I'ma (hit em hit em) 
Respect mines to the day of my demise 
Don't fuck wit me 'cause the flows (killa killa) 
Whoever ever who wants it? 
Its yours, now your gonna (get it get it) 
(feela feela) nigga full of holes 
Threat em like hoes and show no love to them homo thugs 
Its us you want to fuck with 
As soon as them slugs skip from body to body 
Go from brave to bitch
I don't respect it plus niggas committed treason 
Who want it with Ja? who ready to die breathing 

[Chorus: x2]

Ja baby, one of the many many niggas who sip hennessy 
Wit the two seaters, sit'n on twenties 
I, I be wit runnin' in, runnin' out 
Then, thou bestow hit em up, gun em down 
Niggas ain't ready for Ja, anyways anyhow 
I give it give it go niggas, claimin' that they live it 
Real (niggas niggas) brandish then iron and flash 
Like (hold this hold this) when you got nothin' to live for 
Notice, niggas be hot, and more explosive 
Focus, ready to rip em up wit the dope, this 
My life, niggas is frontin' and stuntin' for nothin' 
Better act right, fore I spark and dim your light? 
I'ma hasard to niggas, a bastard 
To bitches, when in doubt, go for stealth, and clap the finish 
Anything movin rightfully hit for wrong doing
I'ma follow and encourage all my niggas to what?

Black Child,"Lights out niggas! (Huh)
You clowns (Ha, Ha, Ha)
The Murderers is here now
The game has changed
You know what I mean
Nobody knows you anymore
Your records make no sense
You know what I mean
I just want to know, all I want to do, 
I just want to know, how does it feel
Huh, let me know 
What it feel like, huh
  
I know y'all niggas is, thinking of thoughts, 
How y'all gon' catch the Rule
It's, catch a dude and, send the feud
But it won't do, 'cause now I got a crew nigga
Black Child, Tah, Murda fucking Inc. nigga
O-1 and Vita, keep the dope and the heater
Or the fucked up rental, or a hot two seater
As long as the love with me
Hoods will never forget me 
I could put raps in them, and shine up the city
Like elected Frank Nitty, jot a Big Poppa
For reasons of, we run up in a big truck and pop ya
Midnight opera
Over the wheels, slug body marks, and pop up
  
Seem like y'all niggas ain't never gon' learn
Either you hitting, or the nigga getting hit
'Cause son, when I click and cock, my shit gon' pop
And never been, a small nigga 
Always a score nigga
That be up in your braud nigga 
You fraud nigga
Cop yae, from far, but never raw niggas
My A's and SK's will rob when it's war nigga
Product and money
So if you want fifteen, it's twenty
And if you less than ten, I won't bend
Or y'all niggas to run with it
Gun busting, I done did it
And anything else that come with it
You don't want it
If it's real, put the deal on it
Stand up niggas will have you sitting in chairs with wheels on them
And that murder shit, I'm still on it
Murder for life
Give a fuck if you a accept it
You better respect it, unless it's, one of my fam' members
Leave whoever into this involvement in legal tendency
Laying where the dirt be
You dig this
Better recover with some big shit
Or duck when this fifth spit
  
Another question: Is you willing to die 
Just as much as you want to kill?
  
I went from handcuff recovering 
Blowing up from bubbling
Shot muscling
All my checks doubled in
Fuck tussling
Word to God
Got a hundred men, with guns and tems
And we love Mack-10's
Since the sex, got a nigga blushed with me
Got a nigga wet
Dropped the lex 
Copped the tech
We cashing checks, son
We out to get the decimals
Don't know about the rest of you
You fucking with professionals
Murderers, that will split your juggle up
Motherfucker I'll cut ya
And you think Tah touch ya
Then we flip shit with bitches that ride all day
And niggas that get head, on the highway
And niggas hating 
To see Satin
Or be played
I'm gon' tell yo' hoe, you in hell waiting
While niggas on Earth
Flossed like they first
For what it's worth
Murderers blast first
  
Niggas respect murder everywhere
It's the streets
Nobody's dancing in the streets
Huh, the streets is ours man, murder
  
Nigga, it's so hard to say good-bye
I wonder why
Take a sneak peak kissing herbs on a high
Hah, I'm down for whatever, whenever
Murderers stick together
See Vita, be that chick to hard throb you nigga 
Fuck you, then rob you nigga
A grimy braud, that will set you and wet you
Leave you for my dogs to fetch you
Tie you up and wet you
Unless you, talking pacos again
It don't matter
The longer we spend, the longer we win
And Gotti, showed me how to work these niggas
??? these niggas
And hurt these niggas
And I'll be there, when my niggas need bail
Catch a body, take the stand, and won't tell
T-tale, I flip wholesale retail
Cheap, so you can get deep into this female
  
Gangstas and hoes are together
Don't let nobody tell you no different, man
It's the beginning of time
I love my bitches
  
Motherfucker it's on one
When I come through, niggas run
Niggas know
Equipped with guns, ya heard so
You get plugged up and gutted out
Found dead with a gun in your mouth
Now what you talking about?
Scold on these streets
I'm involved with thugs, who carry heat
To lift you off your feet
The riding suite
But when it's time to eat, the guns come

Think it out with the mind with the heart, attack
In the soul I tend to get attached, these the things that
Make me different, undeniably gifted

Hit a club, then rush the door, niggas fuck the known
That's why we've been blazed, to you, froze it up
Had your name to the crease so you closed it up

Leavin' you nothin' to steal, so no pain to feel
So fuck the world, ya either get when you see the sink skin
No more than my thugs than your guns let off

I earned connections, every time I burn my weapon
Y'all niggas gonna learn your lesson
Fuck the Feds, nigga, we spit hollow heads
Our motto is 'Shed blood for dead thug'

That shed blood in hell, when my slugs set bail
Pray for death from your cell, I won't bet we got to jail
From pretty niggas with half a nickel flow
Them bitch niggas, they keep their dimes on the low

Y'all niggas is lame, commercial niggas, get out the game

We spit them things from point blank range at you
Then ask what the fuck you gon' do

Test the mic on your gun, lose your life an' your ones

Bendin' her up while I'm hollerin', “I don't give a fuck”
So I move like like it such and y'all can't get enough
Of The Murderers, it'll murda y'all, nigga, what, what?

I know y'all are ready to die, know why?
'Cause the pain is too much to bare while alive
So I cock my nine then close my eyes
Take another hit an' then creep an' blow minds

These are hard times, niggas, in these streets an' bust blind
Out of fear, out of despair but never in the air
We gonna take to this, point blank range in your Range Rov'
Pistol with the kids an' rape your stray hoe

We The Murderers, yo, what you expect from us?
We niggas you can't trust, that don't really give a fuck
We dedicated to street life, game an' hustle
I don't wanna be white, let them black an' live for struggle

My niggas tote guns for hittin' you an' your squad up
Now we got the upper hand, so keep your palms up
Niggas, if you want it with Ja, come in an' line up
Guaranteed you be meetin' your Maker, your times' up

Negative, I can go into the streets we live
Paper, foreign niggas be murderin' shit
So what, what? Niggas is holla, “Yo, what up?”

We don't give a what, what?
All of my ladies, it's all gravy
Get your tubs up, it's murder, turn it up
Plus, ain't nobody hotter than Totti, so who you ridin' with?

We bouncin in and outta countries like an immigrant
Snatchin up yens and pesos and dead presidents
That's probably why shit got hot so quick
Slingin bricks, gettin cash, with my click
And its all good the way we be livin life
Spendin hundreds during the day and making g's in the night
You only live once, and you only die once
You gotta make what you want (Nigga) and take what you want (Bitches)
You only live once, and you only die once
You gotta make what you want (Nigga) and take what you want (Bitches)

Used to stash halves under the couch
Till the neighbors start runnin their mouths
And have the feds running in my house
The game will never forget, who slipped and losing their grow
Blowing my head and old timers throwing jewels in it
Seen it all, from heavy weights scared
To them control the blocks niggas get knocked niggas

Bubble hard most of my life

Swinging wit yo, I rather
Die young and then grow old and blue
Whether it's crack, dope, or coke
We slinging it, 20 g's a night, we bringing it
Avoid the law, and from the crack,
Picture the hole in the half a brick, half a brick
To a key, now I supply the dee
And the niggas that I once bought from, buy from me
All sales, retail, Fish scales, Ivory
I'm trying to see if I could build a fortress underground
So when Feds come in lurkin, I'm nowhere to be found
I'm the type to take a brick, bust it down
into dimes and nicks, find some strips and flood the town
If I ever hit the ground, I'm just clickin and cockin
And run up into your spot, and get to poppin instead of shoppin
and not stoppin, until there's profit involved
So when the profit is lost, fuck splittin it
I pocket it all, ya heard?

Hit the dealer and cop a drop if the eyes is buggy 
And pull up in front of the spot cause the mommies love me 
(It¡¦s gangsta) yeah and ain¡¦t no nigga gone match me 
Stocky, chubby nigga voice real raspy 
I see you real flashy ""but that ain¡¦t gone last nigga""

Six-hundred bad bitch on it holding down the throttle 
And fuck that beef shit cause some beef won¡¦t die 
And some niggas will say they gangsta but they won¡¦t ride

In a hood near you about to burn it down 
Word to God it feels like I¡¦m from every hood 
'cause when you ghetto your ghetto with gats you good 
Sell cracks if you could bust your gat when you should 
It¡¦s for my blacks from the bricks back to Inglewood 
We eat together nigga fuck the crossroads 
In this world my flow is another lost soul 
My shit sounds like shots from a four pound 
For these bitch clowns it¡¦s war now 
It¡¦s all about paper that¡¦s my issue 
Fuck peace you can have a piece of the pistol

Everybody gonna die but nobody want dead 
Die motherfucker die, it¡¦s your life 
Everybody want to live, but they want to live scared 
Die motherfucker Die, that¡¦s your life

Niggas know the truth 
Rule raises the roof 
'cause I pop more shots than Abdul-Rauf 
And when the concludes I bring closure to the situ 
Come through squeeze eight out the stolen black pinto 
Niggas know my mental kill or be killed head for the hills 
But don¡¦t never slide down it if you to high ground it 
(puff, puff) uhhh! Is how it sounded two shots through and silent 
And one nigga stripped of his talents 
New fucking Yiddy City the sex and violence 
Where first time offenders get floated to the island 
And one time give a nigga one time 
Breathe wrong and a nigga have a blown mind 
I blow lines like an addict 
Bust guns erratic shine blind like carats 
Rules above average me and this music make a marriage 
So I thee wed till I¡¦m either jailed or dead motherfuckers

Tired of hoes takin' offers, instead of orders

Cause in the late '60's this game was flawless
Until blow got on the rise
Them ol' Jacks was slingin' pies in bell bottoms and buttonflies

But now, pop yo collars, blow set for sag
And we still fly birds L-A-X to Lag
They roll caddies with white walls, we ride Benz with mags
Still the goal remains the same, guard from feds

All the anger in my heart who we thank for this
Yo I can't thank a soul but God and guns
Don't kill a damn fool it's a animant's steel (drugs)
It's the liquor and the bills cause a man to steal
It's the lack of Medicaid and these bitches got AIDS
And they snaggin at the why, player we too high
I ain't really into ballin and tossin my chips (uh huh)
Rather cop real estate then ride big whips
Rather trick on my wife and go real a dick or hips
Slick bitch that's strict man, she can't get shit
But she get trashed on the car hood by Hoodstock
We got good stock
and size does matter bitch, that's why we slang good cock
Back the thirty eight slug, back out (what what)
Look out the way, 'fore your whole hood shot up (yeah)

[Chorus - Black Child - 2X - w/ ad libs]
The Inc. is back, the Inc. is back
The Inc. is back, the Inc. is back
The Inc. is back, the Inc. is back
Black Child is gutter, it's on motherfuckers

The Inc. is back, the Inc. is back
The Inc. is back, the Inc. is back
Black Child is gutter
I don't give a fuck what I sell out with a gun motherfucker

[Verse 3 - Black Child]
I got stocks in the hood, sold rocks in the wood
Pop up on your block, with the glock like its good
Got niggaz scared to cop and drop like I'm Suge
Pop if you could, watch if you would
Nigga go platinum from the federal pen
Go 150 months, and come home gettin rich again
Nigga it's sicker than, I hope you listenin
Nigga we glistenin, pop off and leave you in the dead man position
Black Child is Murder, why'all forgettin
The work I put in, the dirt I done did
On this earth niggaz lives is worthless
Unless you worth a few million, school your children
Let the game get to 'em, then they brain get ruined
Mine speak foreign languages fluently
Hoodstock exchange ain't nothin new to me
Cop and go, set 'em shoppin up to Unity
I've been ticklin clit ever since puberty
Might taste it if it smells clean to me
Mama lean with me, holler and scream with me

[Chorus - Ja Rule - 2X - w/ ad libs]
The Rule is back, the Rule is back
The Rule is back, the Rule is back
Like 'Pac said ""keep your head up man""
Like Biggie Biggie ""give me one more chance""
Haha, niggaz

[Verse 4 - Ja Rule]
I +Clap Back+ just from my mental anguish
This cash is aimless, cop the new yellow Vanguish
And I ride swervin down the westside highway
Get high like a G4 on the runway
I can't land it man with gun in hand
A hundred grand in escrow tryna expand
A million niggaz that brick, whole bricks to grams
Just leave with money, its seems like its Uncle Sam
So keep (hustlin) I done roll that comes from all the pain and the (strugglin)
(Look at here) federal agents (runnin in)
Come again, it must be mistaken identity
Like when Oswald took the rap for killin a Kennedy
We in the street, not industry niggaz
And because we're called ""the Murderers"" that don't make us killaz, now does it?
Now it's not home but still them trumpets blowin
Hold on cause the leader of this mission is a pro

Yeah..
Yeah, yeah, yo
I got a knack for pushin crack, and cookin raw coke
Fresh off the boat, no vest but I tote, and wear it like a coat
I'm starin through the scope, with one eye open and one shut
Zero in on the target, spark him and watch his head bust
Ain't s*** to discuss, unless it's moneybags
or the SK-8, drop Jag with funny tags
Homey laugh now but die later when the lead dump
And double barrel slugs like Elmer Fudd, I'm handsome

[Black Child]
Some of your favorite rappers is flamin, I'm bangin things at them
They claim they gangster, lettin mens give brains to them
I aim the stainless, let the games begin
Bang bang dangerous, my gun gang famous
My hoes don't speak english, catch 'em at the foreign money exchange
New Armani leather in the Range
When you see my gang, tuck in your chain
We stuck in the game, we f***in the same, bang!

Black's out of his mental, I black out with pistols

Bang bang, n****, 'til the day we die
A tooth for a tooth and a eye for a eye

N**** you know it's, business befo' pleasure, money over chicks
Dummies in the clip, nickel on my hip patrollin through the strip
Bet a stack, head crack, no rollin to the six
Scoop up my chips, then I split, with my beautiful b****
Like Jada Pinkett Smith, for that paper I leave stinkin and stiff
Your pinky and wrist, and your necklace
Get removed n****, my wolves is playin hardball
Leavin him bloody like a Pelican Bay yard brawl

Who want to know why I got so much beef with so many rappers?
Drama, it's the INC redrum spun backwards
Karma, is a muh'f***er watch your actions
Cause the clip to the max slips in bananas
I catch fire like matches {*whew*} then blow out
And the flyest crews goin the fastest
Pull up to the hottest club in New York, with my hazards on
No tags, I just drove it off the showroom floor
Straight cash, bout my paper, I'm on my gangster
Doin this s*** for ten years, n****z I'm major
Maybach and all that, same behaviour
Money over b****es, b****es over strangers
Guns befo' bangers but bangers do
For n****z that had enough and ain't got no clue
that they can get slayed, flex and get sprayed
And spin they head like yo' hottest DJ's, motherf***ers!

The gauge and the glock, and I keep a blade
I ain't afraid if it pop, the gauge still a gun

Married murder one, sleep with the fishes
Tasting red rum, young and corrupted
Nothing to f*** with, straight out of the gutter
With no introduction

Black Coffey,"Bring it on back to the young days when things wasn't so hard
 Playin kickball in the school yard
 The year before kindergarten when memories started at the day care
 All the Little kids used to play there
 We had no worries just hated nap time but fingerpaintin' and playin' tag was fine
 And we would all run around except for this girl
 She stayed in the corner, Yeah her name was Mary Anne
 She missed half of the school days scince the year began
 Never wore a shirt that showed more than her hands
 She rockin' jeans & Long sleeves in like 90 degrees
 You know lil' kids they treat her like she got a disease
 Came in 1 day all her hair was gone
 Said her mamma cut it off cause she did something wrong
 Tears in her eyes when she finally said somethin 
 Usually she would get scared and wouldn't say nothin
 
 Days that went by, she had to cry, wonder why did it happen to me
 Day after day, she slipped away, wonder why did it happen to me
 
 Elementary she got the seat next to me
 Lucky i wasn't mean like the rest could be
 She treated like an outcast wonder how long she could outlast
 Bein alienated by the whole class
 It was still touch and go with the whole school scenario
 In for days out for weeks still scared to speak
 I wonder if that one time she had tried to tell and the teacher shrugged her off like Oh Well
 I wonder if that shut her down
 Maybe she had no one to turn to
 Maybe this little girl didn't know what to do
 We had a project one week me and Mary Anne a team
 So i invited her to my house for ice cream
 She bangin on the door at the house invite her to sit on the couch 
 She looked me in the eyes
 Mary Anne began to cry
 I said what's wrong she said she wanted someone to tell her why
 
 Days that went by, she had to cry,
 wonder why did it happen to me
 Day after day she slipped away, wonder why did it happen to me
 
 After that incident she didn't really  want to talk to me
 I'd see her in the hall 
 Call out but she wouldn't walk with me
 Junior high she got cover up caked up
 You could see the bruises underneath the make - up
 Stories to make up people askin question now
 She breakin down but still no confessions now
 She walk around dazed out lost in another land spaced out
 And as days go by she grows more distant
 Teachers barely aware of her existence
 She in and out more out than in
 And one day i'm in class
 The ambulance pass screechin
 Down by the artroom off to the right in the bathroom
 They found Mary Anne on the floor
 A bottle next to her 
 Said she took like 50 pills or more
 And left a note that said she couldnt handle it no more

 wonder why did it happen to me
 Day after day she slipped away, wonder why did it happen to me",Mary Anne,2003

Hard times, look over your peoples cause everybody dying
Osama Bin Loden is dropping bombs man, in a situation like this
How can I reach calm man, calm man, my nigga
This is hard times, like its so much gun smoke and see the stars
Shine
We living on dreams but is they coming true, what I'm gonna do
Make a million and pull a stunt or two, a stunt or two

Step into the world of a mob nigga, live in so much pain
The rain steady pumping me up, locked down on hard times
But I'm knowing that I gotta make it, running on my deadline
Giving out flat lines, cause if you think that I'm feeling
Fucking up by mine man, I gotta maintain
Its like everything that I had, it won't ever be the same
I feel I'm sicking home the cemetery
'Cause that's where all of my people rest
I can't take the stress, I'm fin to send it through somebody chest
That's why I walk around pissed off, strapped with a vest
I done been through a lot, ready to release the glock
Vicinities South, a brother on my Dickie, I be ready to ride
And I'm sick of this shit, I ain't fin to be hiding out, lately
Street life's got a nigga lost, will I wind up in a coffin
I don't know, I'm about to blow, I don't wanna take no mo'
But when I bust in a rush, you better hit the flow
Reality is a motherf**ker, that's what they was telling a nigga
That's just the truth, I lost my nigga Screw 
And Relay too and Andrew, now what about Danny Boo
That's fucked up, growing up in a childhood all alone with nobody
No mama no daddy, Z-Ro I see why these niggas can't relate to us
'Cause we them thugs of another kind
Making these niggas feel us two rhymes
'Cause if they lived the life that we live
They'd probably be broke down, crying and dying

Living in the ghetto, everyday is a motherfucking test
And I just can't rest, gotta keep a vest around my chest
Seem like everybody wanna start a little plex

On bigger and brighter thangs
Steady trying to come out the storm
From hurricanes, to heaven and lighter rain
Running away from the police

Nigga fuck peace, its all about war
Nothing but a A-K and a H-K and a Tommy Gun
Sitting in the back of the car, I just can't cope
Everybody is a suspect, even if you don't bust I'ma bust back
We down to ride and, all you little 
Bitches and niggas get off my nut sack
Been eighteen lonely years, since I buried my T Dogs
When I be shooting the breeze
But I'm still conversating like she ain't gone
You can take a look at this light of mine
Never did glimmer, never did shine
'Cause I resort to a life of crime
And I know I'm wrong, but I gotta get mine
Fools don't understand me, a nigga be nervous 24/7
Puffing on sticky, eyes redder than period candy
Look at my pockets, I might as well stop it
Because them hoes on flat, look in the freezer
And a sive, ain't nothing but a stomach, these are hard times

Ro pass me the AK, one of these niggas
Fin to pay for everything that I'm feeling, ain't no more healing
To the head with lead, is the only thing I'ma be drilling
My nigga this hard times, and the way that it look
I don't think that it's gonna get better, the only thing that's here
Is to suck it up, inside I know that's why we not giving a fuck
Ready to bust, on anything this life feeling, like we on our last breath
I'm quiet as kept, my nigga don't start 
Or else somebody gon see they death
Or hate us like that, but this side of Trae it be like that all times
The only thing that I know more than pain, is pain and me never dying

Poverty stricken and headed to prison
Running because of the life, you looking for codeine
Or amphetamines, I got em at the cheapest price
Living by the rules of the street life, fin to get niggas
Better beat the street light home, after dark I par-park
Everybody be tripping, attempting to get rich
Dig a bigger ditch bitch bleed, I'm a motherfucking man
Trying to do all that I can, I always held my ground
And I never ran, got shot for taking a stand 
I need a plexing, because I'm stressing, losing my mind

Black Dyke Band,"Ginger Elvis Presley looked a fraction sad 
Roaming the whole town from bin to bin 
Well living on the streets wasn't all that bad 
Where no-one seemed to know that he was King 

The sound of New York City 
Isn't police sirens wailing 
It's the sound of Wall Street tills 
Whilst everyone is failing 

Sometimes you feel expensive 
Sometimes you feels so cheap 
You can roam the streets a King 
Whilst everyone's asleep 
You can mime to any record 
With a hairbrush or a spoon 
But God help the singer out of tune 

A crippled Mohammad Ali 
Looked at bad luck in the mirror 
Bad luck looked back at him and sighed 
He looked a good foot smaller 
And a couple of stone thinner 
And if anyone came toward him 
He would hide 

The sound of North America 
Isn't Christians quietly praying 
It's the sound of shuffling feet 
That don't know where they're going 

Sometimes you feel expensive 
Sometimes you feels so cheap 
You can roam the streets a King 
Whilst everyone's asleep 
You can fight with anybody 
With a glimmer of a chance 
But God help the boxer with no hands 

A homeless Greta Garbo 
Moves across the street 
The moonlight shining clearly 
Through her skirt 
A real life living legend 
That no-one wants to meet 
And that's when being Garbo 
Really hurts 

The lyrics of ""New York"" 
May have Frank Sinatra singing 
But the rhythm and the melody 
Were dead black men swinging 

Sometimes you feel expensive 
Sometimes you feels so cheap 
You can roam the streets a Queen 
Whilst everyone's asleep

Black Dyke Band,"Well sitting in a bar alone 
Where no-one knows your name 
Is like laying in a graveyard 
Wide awake 
You're scared that if you cough or yawn 
You might wake up the dead 
So pretend to read a paper 
Or just drink instead 

I'm a stand-up comedian 
But I'd sit down if I could 
The world just seems 
To want folk like me to stand 
And the punch-lines seem to disappear 
Like clouds across the sky 
And the laughter could be real 
Or could be canned

Whiskey by the jar

Could never really hurt 
But living with a drunk 
Well no-one deserves

You're not sure he's still alive 
Don't bother with the cemetery 
He'll be down at liar's dive 

I'm a traveling businessman 
I just stopped in for one drink 
You'll find 
That I'm not like the other men 
Their noses are red 
Whilst mine is only pink 
And they didn't choose their drink 
Their drink chose them 

Rum by the kettle drum 
Whiskey by the jar 
At Liar's Bar 

And the grave-digger's smiling 
At his reflection in his spade 
He's visiting the seediest 
The shallowest of graves 
The vocal chords of elephants 
And the characters of mice 
They're singing ""whiskey, whiskey"" 
So good they named it twice 

Well don't pass buildings with lights on 
If I said that I did I'd have lied 
'Cause what looks like a Chinese restaurant 
May have Chinese New Year inside 
And son all my life I've been searching 
The bars I've been in I forget 
The lights outside ever brighter 
But a light on the inside not yet 

Rum by the kettle drum 
Whiskey by the jar 
At Liar's Bar 

And he's a world-wide traveler 
He's not like me or you 
But he comes in mighty regular 
For one who's passing through 
That one came in his work clothes 
He's missed his last bus home 
He's missed a hell of a lot of buses 
For a man who wants to roam 

If I look rough I am rough 
If I look sad I am 
If I look broke I am broke 
Just a broke down piece of man 

I've turned over enough leaves 
To fill an autumn 
And if I had one final wish 
I'd be your slave for a decade 
If you could take me away from this 
If you took me away from this 
I'd be different you'd see 
'Cause I didn't choose the drink 
A drink just chose me

And I'm drinking like a fish

He loved her. 
He chopped off his left arm. 
(The Good One) 
And sent it to her with a box of chocolates.

I left my wife and kids back in LA
I was no good at playing house
So I started heading south
A busboy said ""You best keep away
From the water""

La Barra Zona Rosa was my home
Some guys they never heard the phrase ""when in Rome""
Well she knifed that stupid sailor
Now he's gonna need a tailor
For his very special day away 
From the water

I thought it would be very nice 
To go downtown and see the bull fight
But the beast had not a chance
When I saw the lance

I heard the sound of a Volkswagen
They tied his body to the bumper and started dragging
I saw the blood separate away
From the water

I hope they're doing OK
I left my wife and kids back in LA
I was no good at killing
So I started up gin milling
And I still just keep away (to this day)

Beneath the TV was a secret door
There was a ladder down to a tunnel

Until I popped up in my local gym

Piercing the golden queen?

Back in the tunnel I heard the voices
Coming down from yesterday
I drank my bottle of sugar water
And headed out through the city's decay

Fell through a vent in a warehouse
Landed on a Van Nuys sound stage

A cold, naked California sage

It was so hard to believe

Were true

I wonder where your thoughts are

I wonder who you are
Fallen so far to be nowhere

I wonder where you are

Red hands wash the sleep away
Sifting through the white on white
Underneath the failing light

To rest my eyes
Cause you'll be gone

Black Happy,"Too much talk has been going on lately
and when I get done there's some people
gonna' hate me
I can only smile while I'm watching you shout
there's too many people moving in the
frame they don't know about
I keep hearding about this line

You keep saying that all is fine
I read about and watch you everyday
Nothing wrong with that 'cause that's okay
I watch you holler to make some change
I watch you promise to rearrange
You're marching hard to prove your point
Your token affection is new in this joint

Time and time and time again
We keep finding out you're your own best friend
If we criticize anything you say
You tell us we're wrong and get out of the way
You think we're livin' in '84
When you don't know it's sad and what's more
Big Brother's coming not blind or deaf
Didn't you know he's coming from the left

We gotta' clean this up, we gotta' make this top
We need to talk in another way
We need to watch what we say
We gotta' forget all that, we gotta' drop our bats
Everything you're walking is unclean junk
We don't play that game punk
I'm sick of hearing you speak your mind

It's the same old chatterbox every time
Every time we offer something new
You shoot it down and say we haven't go a clue
I'm sick of hearing you speak your mind
It's the same old chatterbox every time
Every time we offer something new
You shoot it down and say we haven't go a clue

It hear you say our minds are shut
What's your definition of trust
Another person another bed on another day
Your lame excuse is that we make you this way
I know there's a place,
I know there's a race
I washed my hands in dirt, I prayed it wouldn't hurt
I couldn't even look, I watched the hands I shook

I asked for so much more
Everybody's got their own opinion, here's mine
You just divorced your 86th wife
and you want to' talk about real life
You're telling us about your grand world plan
Which part of I don't care don't you understand
You say we're wrong and that depends
What do you see from behind that lens

You say we're a world with all one voice
But you're never gonna' let me
make my own choice
Everybody's got their own opinion, here's mine
None of your ideas ever stick,
I must admit that's a real nice trick
Your voice must hurt, you should give it a rest

Add to the fact you're a creep at best
I'm sick of watching you eat your own
The fact remains that you've never grown
We're wearing body bags not body gloves
and none of this would happen if we talk about love

I hope that this will end, I pray I find my friends
I know that I have one, ending time has just begun
I still pray every night, but that doesn't make it right
This happened once before,
it's always ripped and torn

I want to be there when I look him in the eye
I want to see all the things we need to be

I'm sorry but I have no guilt now

Hello to loneliness it's here at your request
You've made your bed so you should lie down

But Holly would never understand this anyway

Black Happy,"So many things have changed in my short life
That I thought would always be there
Yet when all that passes by my eyes none of it
Will come as a big surprise, I'm expecting it
To tell the truth I know that when my eyes are closed
And shut again I'll be happy that way
Cause if I don't know where I'm going
If I don't know where I've been
Maybe you can show me now
Can you tell me how

I'm going home
When I'm too small to see it all, I hold on tight so I won't fall
And lose myself Cause if I don't know where tomorrow is how can I
Tell where today has been and when I'm going

I'm going home
Something looking like a mail order wolverine
Just nodded it's head at me
Shout 'bout the looks and sounds that I've heard and seen
Mad about the fact I'm free from his multiheaded smile that
He is shining on, rising in the face of man, holding back everything
He is holding while I'm smiling at him I'm free from him
Home I wish I was homeward bound

If I had sight and I could feel would that finally make me real
Or can you answer that to me, you won't fall behind me anyway

So I've gotta' watch you every day so I don't join you today
I'm going home",Home,1994
Black Happy,"I want to' be more like my old self
And the words of promise spoke to me
And I change my mind eventually
And the earth was shining yesterday
And I saw the nations look away
And me head was screaming for something more
And I watched as they unlocked the door
And the counted off from one to ten
And the added two and began again

And I saw a mountain coming down
And when the smoke had cleared from all around
I was saving for another day
But now I know what they were trying to say
And I cannot put my faith in you
There's nothing worse that I could do
And when I woke up out of this
The only thing I've ever missed
Was time",Myself,1994
Black Happy,"Do you want to see my true face
And get to know my real place
Do you really want to see how much I know
And feel, I know what I'm supposed to be
I'd rather feel that to see and when I run there is
Nothing that can hold me up
I had a hot streak one time it helped to make

Up your mind and now it's showing everything
I need to be, my word does not mean a thing
It only helps to get free so I can do as I please
What is hiding beneath my skin
It's just the costume I'm in
It's changing colors any time I want it to
I need attention all day

I'm prone to make some mistakes
But it's never my fault, it's yours
I make the other half see
How blessed they are to have me
How lucky they should feel that I'm around for them
No matter what I can't fall
I'm always here for them all
Just as long as everything is always geared to me

I'm a jerk, I'm a creep, I'm so shallow, I seem deep
I got what I want and I got how I need
And I know that you will always listen to me
Do you think I can help the world
My tail is hidden and curled
And I can lash back anytime that I want to
Ideas are none but my own

I don't care what I have sown
I'm out of reach for anything to come back on me
When all is finally done at least I know I'll have fun
And by the way how were things for you
I really couldn't care less
'cause I don't clean up the mess
Everything is always taken care of for me

Mine is never to take the blame
My story's never the same
I'll rearrange it to try and get away
And when I go to my grave
I don't care if I am saved
I'll get the same treatment that I got down here",Shoveljerk,1994
Black Happy,"I see my brother walking on the edge
He's holding back his fear and so he smiles instead
Of looking for the snap and all the weight is on his back
And when he shifts his head and he plays dead he
Whispers what I want I want
Peace coming down over me
My sisters caught up in the holy lights

But what she chose to do is so far removed from right
That she's always wanting something more
To keep herself from being bored and when she shifts
Her head and she plays dead and she
Whispers what I want I want
Peace coming down over me
I can't tell you how to live you're old enough now to give

We move in circles big and small on every day
My mind is quicker than my eye
When my heads pointed to the sky
I notice everything inside me is at ease
I wish I could help them all when I can't feel so small
But then I realize sometimes I can't help myself
And every night when I pray I don't know what I should say

I can do more than damn myself
My family is calling, coming any day
And I know by the book that the time will lose it's way
Because a world inside is waiting for a place in line to be
Where the truth is clear and it appears and they
Whisper what I want I want
Peace coming down over me",Shuckin' the Jive,1994
Black Happy,"And if I'm not too sure about the state I'm in
I watch the circles cross and join as one
And when I'm asking for someone to begin again
I hope that you won't turn around and run
Don't we ever think about the other side my soul and I are just
Looking for some time
And if we ever get what we are looking for
Maybe we'll get something that we can't ignore
I saw a lady whose feet were covered by the sand
She won't maneuver into things she shouldn't be
And as she raised her head I saw the face of man
I could only jump back and think of what I'd seen
Spirit rise
And if I'm not too sure about the state I'm in

They are the ones that never seem to get caught
But none of us should ever have to lie to make friends
But we'd rather lie than to sleep with the dogs
Love is what I'll fight it all with,
Love I won't save it for another day,
Love is what I'm gonna kick it in with...
Love I don't want the arch to lose that way.
I had it all once, and I threw it all away.

Peace is the thing that everybody here is preaching
It's on the left side because it's everybody's love
But I've seen you spit on someone in the same breath as peace
When someone disagrees you always give it up

Love is what I fight it all with.
Love I won't save it for another day.
Love is what I'm gonna kick it in with.
Love I don't want the arch to lose that way.

Now I see a kid and his face is sad.
Let's stick him in a corner, so he won't bother us.
He's gonna rip it up, he's gonna kick it out,
He's gonna tear down all the walls that hold him in.
He's gonna push this, like you've never seen before.

The old man is still angry now
Because the black and white are still around,
But he's still got his best trick up his sleeve.

The face of all that we see
I told him this I said ""Hey soul!
Start listening to me!"" I told him,
""Dog you smell like fish""
Garlic makes my feet stink

He got my point, we had a good laugh
We laughed until my belly hurt
I'm not the savior, and I will never be
But that don't change my worth
He started moving, he started circling
I heard him whisper in my face
""One on one,"" he said, ""That is the only way
You and I will change this place."" He told me

Bring a politician to his knees

The point is moot
I get the car
The point is moot

So the joy I'm talking about
Is well worth shouting about
But it sets 'em off makes 'em turn around
And walk the other way but I gotta thank You
For keeping the smile on my face
While the other one has turned 
His back to run away

That's why I try to keep my head up towards the sky
Sit back and watch, let me take you on a ride
Uh, natural high..

Yo, yo, make it rain again, spit flame again
Now, watch how I'm aimin' 'em, my bare hands is stranglin'
Time to bang again, camera shots anglin'
That's right I got your head piece danglin'
Mic's is tanglin', toast champagne again
Coast to coast now, join the campaign again
I fuck more women than Wilt Chamberlain
It's, you-God, yeah he Back in the Game again
I'm titanium, mixed with uranium
Crack craniums, no tamin' him
Live at palladium (yeah), jam packed stadium (yeah)
Many men, you're afraid of him
Once they weighed him in, he flushed money down the drain again
Touched vein again, rocks I'm slangin' 'em
Cops can't finger him, SWAT can't bring him in

Cross me, I lay down every one in your vicinity
Keep a fifty cali' or line me in the Akademiks jeans
If I catch a homi', somebody probably run and snitched on me
Rats, runnin' round talkin' this and that
Some white chicks I spit til your wigs sit back
I grind these cracks, 'cause I need cash
G stacks, I lay my game down flat like a Chinese ass
You heard me? Bitches want to observe me, learn me
My mission is gettin' Ritz like Jersey, chips for attorney's
Commissary for niggaz that's in the pen thirsty

Why ... the angels came down and pushed the devil in the dirt
Jerked the memory exist on the iron-on T-shirt
Pythons squeeze til your face turns purple

Dump and run, the long nose cuttin' the soldier's tongue
Your nervous from the burners I'm squeezin'
Without a learner's permit, to carry
The calico stays concealed, if revealead
I must spray this clip through your windshield, it's rea
My whole team reigns supreme, the infrared tech beams
On my next swing, the heavy chain
Deadly but steady aim, I cry ""tears of the sun""
That'll burn the iron hot, as I'm piercin' through your lungs
It's strung by my drug dealer's doses
Ferocious slang that'll bang up your brains in roller coasters
Posters in the background ready to clap rounds
And empty up whole magazines up to the last round

Black Ice,"My youngins get it fucked up when y'all talk about the game
Like it's designed in their favor
Like it ain't outlined for them to waiver
Their rights for a lil' bit of fame

Get in bullshit fights for a lil' name
To get noticed by some niggas that don't give two fucks about you
Tell 'em you don't do the jives and shucks, and they route you to the shelf
See there's no money in good health

So they need you to be sick with it, ill content and delivery niggas
This nation thrives off misery niggas
So if you ain't trying to let your hard times increase your wealth
Niggas keep that progressive shit to yourself

This is the business of buying souls, and we only tryin' to fuck with those who trying to sell them
See, they may see me as an adversary 'cause they know I'm tryin' to tell them 
About the forest of artists who grow only to meet industry axes
How they take niggas dreams and write then off in their taxes

Contracts is confusing, but don't worry they'll appoint you a lawyer for you whore you
Loan you funds to fuck your soul make you pay it back and still maintain control of your stroll
Your tracks and your hot ass slow flow
they'll keep you looking good and all that, but no dough

You see when that get a bitch, they got a bitch
And contrary to popular opinion it ain't my sistas that switch
It's my brothers
We the dumb motherfuckers

Hardest niggas in the streets turned industry suckers
'Cause we refused to do the knowledge
Nigga, you can't learn this music game in the streets or in college
So you betta pick up a book or something

Or fuck it, FAB will put it in a hook or something
Hope that you listen to it
Got you pumpin' that poison while they paint them illusionary parades and keep pissin' through it
You pussies don't know the price or the sacrifices that this industry makes real niggas walk",Exodus,2004

Senses and feelings distorted, they boarded their vessel Nessel
Discreet in crotches and underneath seats they tuck heat

Between human beings and animals that you should know about

So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel
Nuts, yes, I'm Siskel, yes I'm Ebert

You've had enough of two-hand touch,
You want it rough, you're out of bounds

Like the lost catacombs of Egypt,
Only God knows where we stuck it hieroglyphics
Let me be Pacific, I want to be down in your South Seas
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean,
Means small craft advisory
So if I capsize in your thighs, high tide, be minus five,
You sunk my battle ship please turn me on,
I'm Mr. Coffee with an automatic drip
So show me yours I'll show you mine ""Tool Time""
You'll love it just like Lyle

Seit damals gefällt mir die Stadt besser als zuvor

Zuhause dreh ich Sound auf, die Nachbarn ham Humor
Die stehn auf frische Downbeats aus meinem Recordstore

Heute lebe ich im Osten zwischen Blümchentapeten
Kümmer mich nicht allzu sehr um Taler und Moneten
Baue hier und da´n Track, aber dafür´n konkreten!

Well, they ring them bells
They're throwing rice at you and me

No one knows who made it

And hit you in the head or chest
Then your body will disinegrate

And talons growing out of its face

Could defeat this awful foe

For the ice sword of Gaultry

That's what you told me
That's what you told me now I'm damned to see it,
Damned to see it through

Eternity is where I'll be, forever now, for all to see
I'm down alive and giving head
I'm upside down, fall through the well
That is much to pay for me
So shoot yourself through prophecies
I'll be back in a different form
To reap what's mine, to lead the born beyond

That's what you told me
That's what you told me
That's what you told me so what am I going to do?
That's what you told me
That's what you told me
That's what you told me now I know it's all about you
That's what you told me
That's what you told me
That's what you told me now I'm damned to see it,
Damned to see it through",The Lie,2011

Listen to it closely 'cause it's scary and you might get confused (a-ha-ha-ha)
Choose your message wisely because it just might be the last thing you do
Counter-clock wise, open your eyes
Play it backwards, spin it faster
God lived like a devil dog, a goddamn mad mad dog

You all right, mad dog?
R ew ohw r ew
You all right, mad dog?
R ew ohw r ew

Speaking in tongues got the demons spitting up blood
Out from the speakers, you shake and you gettin' a buzz
Drop the needle, you'll discover
Judas Priest said ""Kill your mother""
God lived like a devil dog a goddamn mad mad dogg

Black Lips,"K-hole at the Dalí
Seeing the unknown
Well it might have been a molly
'Cause my mind's being blown
Take the escalator to the next floor
Such a strong sedater, now I can't find the door

You turn around and you don't know where you've been
You look up at the glass dome and the room beings to spin
Let's go out and find the ocean 'cause I think we need a swim
Turn around, start it over, let's begin

Like the minis at the Louvre
Spinning down the aisle
And the paintings of the Louvre
Now I'm feeling very smart
Like a 3-D picture, stereo's gone
It's a total light picture, kaleidoscope

You turn around and you don't know where you've been
You look up at the glass dome and the room beings to spin
Let's go out and find the ocean 'cause I think we need a swim
Turn around, start it over, let's begin

And the k-hole at the Dalí
Seeing the unknown
Well it might have been a molly
'Cause my mind's being blown

Black Lips,"Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

You're in the void
Got you feeling cold
With your voice
'Cause it's your choice
I've got my poise
And he can bring the noise
With my boys
Puking in a Rolls-Royce

I want to bleed on my squire (and I need)
I want a plier (I gotta be)
My empty pile (a disease)
Take some water (lesser than I need)
'Cause I'm vile (can it be?)
Mister Driver

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

My pecker's long!
It's got me feeling strong
When I sing this song
And you smoke this bong
Rock it all night long
Will you want to be long?
'Cause we're feeling gone
My sexual VietCong
