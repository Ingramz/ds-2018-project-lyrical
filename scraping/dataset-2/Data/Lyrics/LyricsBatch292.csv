Gary Thomas,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,1990
Gary Thomas,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1990
Gary Thomas,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart
 
You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart",You Stepped Out of a Dream,1990
Gary Thomas,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1993
Gary Thomas,"How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last.
How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

It's you or no one for me
I'm sure of this each time we kiss
Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Please don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do then I'm all through
There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you
It's you or no one for me

Please don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do then I'm all through
There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you
It's you or no one for me
For me",It's You or No One,1993

And love will steer the stars

Gary Tole,"I'll never smile again
Until I smile at you
I'll never laugh again
What good would it do?
For tears would fill my eyes
My heart would realize
That our romance is through

I'll never love again
I'm so in love with you
I'll never thrill again
To somebody new
Within my heart
I know I will never start
To smile again

Gary Tole,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me,2007

Gary Urwin,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love

Gary Urwin,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night

Gary Urwin Jazz Orchestra,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2006
Gary Urwin Jazz Orchestra,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You [Trio],2006
Gary Urwin Jazz Orchestra,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,2006
Gary Vail,"Look into my eyes - you will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart - search your soul

You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
You know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you

Look into your heart - you will find
There's nothin' left to hide
Take me as I am - take my life
I would give it all - I would sacrifice
Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for
I can't help it - there's nothin' I want more

Gary Vail,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still,
It had to be you, wonderful you,
It had to be you.

Gary Vail,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening [From South Pacific],1997
Gary Vail,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember

Gary W. Smith,"The General just gave me a medal oh I'm a sight for mom to see
But when the news gets round that I ain't got ole Bill
Some kids gonna think a whole lot less of me
You see she gave me that puppy and said he'd protect me through the night

And if I got hurt he'd go for help or he'd back me up in a fight
He growed all the while I was trainin' forget him I never will
'Cause you'd never see me with right at my heels was Oklahoma Bill
We hit a long ridge one sunup and it seemed like death held all the cards

'Cause we payed and payed with lives of men for every hard fought yard
When finally we drove up to the top there wasn't nothin' but death behind
And as we all dug in we all thanked God though we numbered only nine
And as the snipers switched their guns as darkness closed that hill

My soul companion in the night was Oklahoma Bill
There's no glory in a battle once you've seen its awful cost
But there's glory in the knowledge that your flag is never lost
And yet in the stillness of the nightime and all alone you hold a post

You start cryin' like a baby sittin' there with all the ghosts
You feel your buddies are pattin' your back though their guns're silent and still
It's only a dog tryin' to love you my Oklahoma Bill
I gave my note to the Colonel and I bound a shattered leg

And I said Bill we're sure in trouble he never whimpered or begged
I could tell he hated to leave me I was the only God he ever knew
But quick as a flash he took of through the night like a fightin' marine would do
I kept firin' till help finally came it was him though that saved that hill

A dyin' dog had got through the lines my Oklahoma Bill
That little ol' kid will always wonder what happened to her dog
But she'll find out on Judgement Day when she sees the big Skipper's log
We'll all walk in and bugles'll blow and we'll stand our last revue

And men who've died for men on earth will get their heavenly dues
And if all brave hearts are there that day I'll get my greatest thrill

You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy
And so I dealt you the blow

Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show

It was written on the walls and window shades
And how she'd act a little girl
A deceiver, don't believe her, that's her trade
Sometimes a bottle of perfume
Flowers and maybe some lace
Men brought Louise ten cent trinkets
Their intentions were easily traced
Yes and everybody knew at times she cried
Ah but women like Louise well they get by

Yes and everybody thought it kinda sad
When they found Louise in her room
They'd always put her down below their kind
Still some cried when she died this afternoon

Louise rode home on the mail train
Somewhere to the south I heard her say
Too bad it ended so ugly
Too bad she had to go this way

Ah but the wind is blowing cold tonight
Well goodnight Louise goodnight

I told her not to worry 'bout the little things

Will never tear us apart

And your smile still tears me apart

From outside, an ordinary house. A great house, true - four hundred and eighty 
three rooms, each one with its own marble wash basin and douche, bidet as it 
may. But inside, and the positions are reversed. A human failing, some say a 
disease, but a disease that Sir Francis Dashwood knew, and knew it well. 
Upstairs, inside and a revelation. It's a discotheque. No, no, uh.. there are 
paintings, real, and look here - a rare seventeenth century masterpiece, and if 
I can scrape a little of it off, beneath I can find hidden a fourteenth century 
underpiece. 
Made entirely of eggshells, this lurid work has caused controversy in the world 
of embroidery and anthropologicky. No, I'll say it again, anthropolology. Umm.. 
no quite possibly make an anthropol, no, uh, I mean an apolog..ph.. It has 
enthralled distinguished professors, and in layman's language is ""blinking well 
baffling"". 
But to be more obtusely, ""buggered if I know."" Yes, ""buggered if I know."" And 
that's all we've gleaned so far from experts in fourteenth century painting, 
renaissance, greengrocers, and recently revived members of the public.

handed little 
Servants of the Lord 

And then the atom bomb fell down on Hiroshima, North Dakota 
The year she turned sixteen 
And she said, ""There is something very wrong here. 
Do you know what I mean? Do you know what I mean? 

'Cause I got visions forming in my head 
And I keep hearing what the preacher said 
Said this world will be the death of me

Satchel full of broken hopes and empty picture postcards 
That she'd never send 
Her mama sitting on the front porch step 
Daddy frowning in the darkened doorway, waving his regret 
Then she was jumping on the Santa Fe, summer night in 1947 
Bound for God knew where 
And she said, ""I can see destruction fast approaching. 
I feel it in the air. I feel it in the air. 

And I got visions forming in my head 
(See the blood on the horizon) 
And I keep hearing what the preacher said 
(Said the truth will set you free) 
Said this world will be the death of me 
(I got no one to rely on) 
I know it will, it's bound to be."" 
(Except for me...) 

On a road in Valparaiso, she met a hobo named Old John 
They hunkered down in a gazebo, and chose a star to gaze upon 
Old John said he could see her slipping, and he asked her what was wrong 
She said, ""The rope I had been gripping turned to sand 
And now it's gone, now it's gone. 

Can't you see the writing on the blood soaked blue horizon 
Plain as VJ day. Hear the barking of the 
Drowning dogs, frozen like so many Eisenhower 
Statues in Pompei. I think I'll take another taste 
Old John, to numb my heart, God knows I'm falling fast as 
Atoms through the sky."" She said, 
""This world it sure ain't no place to live in 
But it ain't no place to die. No it ain't no place to die...""

She left his tired love behind, in a laundromat, in black and white 
The powers that be decided it was time to let him go 
So he went rolling like a tumbleweed across the desert of New Mexico 

And he goes chasing the angel of the blue sky 
And he knows she will be waiting for him there 
And he sees his faithful angel of the blue sky 
Floating in the firmament somewhere 

His Dodge gave out, he stepped into a crowded local bar 
He hitched a ride to Abilene, and wondered how he'd come so far 
The signs they came, the rain fell like a baby's newborn tears 
He stood out on the open plain, and felt her hovering so near 

And he goes... 

All that time it was not wasted 
It was the way it had to be 
Whatever sorrow that he tasted set him free 
Clear blue sky, he smiles to think she's waiting close at hand 
He sets his wet clothes out to dry, then trudges toward the promised land 
Come what may, come whatever makes the world go 'round 
He close his eyes up half the day, and listens for her healing sound 

And he goes...

I put on my best sunglasses 
Whatever truth that shines through, for a moment I view 
But of course then the moment it passes 

And I'm standing alone again 
At the crossroads of my melodrama 
With my heart in my hand, dumb and silent I stand 
Like some dime store Dalai Lama

Each one knows me by name 
Each one knows me, they all know me by name 

Come the morning of my soul's dark night 
When I've laid to rest these ghosts that haunt me 
With sweet tenderness I will kiss your red lips 
Not the past or the future shall daunt me

When she turns away you die 
It's a tragic situation 

So you drink one down for courage, two for soul 
You drink a third for good luck, then you stroll 
Out onto the dance floor, 
But your feet are too damn cold 
And you need more insulation 

See her spinning round

Oh, she don't love you 
Oh, she don't see you in the crowd 
Oh, if she did she would not want you anyhow 

Expectation lingers in the air 
The problem is that no one else is there 
Just the memory of your angel, 
All these ghosts in empty chairs

The soul is weakened by love that goes neglected 
The soul is drowning in a sea of sweet perfume and

She'll start regretting this as soon as she is able 

The soul is blackened... 

Oh it's been so long 
Since she felt this way 
Yeah it's been so long 
Since she felt anything 

""Just one more minute."" She whispers in the moonlight 
She's so deep in it, she cannot hold him too tight 
The wheels are turning, she can feel them in the distance 
With such sad yearning, hard to put up much resistance 
The soul is blackened...

Gathering Field,"The sunlight hits me and I shiver 
I rub the sleep out of my eyes 
I pull the mail box open 
And hope to find a sweet surprise 

I stumble back into the kitchen 
I dump out last night's coffee grinds 
I think the whole thing over 
It's like a movie in my mind 

Well they tell me 
I'm gonna have to carry on without her 
But I'm afraid that ain't the way I got it planned 
I'm gonna take a walk today 
I'll go the old familiar way 
I'll walk up to her and I'll say, 
""I've come to win you back Suzanne."" 

The beauty of this life is changing 
When pressed against the cold, hard facts 
The fact is I got restless 
And you say you ain't coming back 

So hello friendly next door neighbor 
Hello bird up on the wire 
The thought of her surrender 
Spreads through me like a forest fire 

Well they tell me... 

How could you believe that you could get away from me so easy 
What kind of man would let the woman of his dreams just go away 
You said I'd never change before but when I knock upon your door 
You'll see babe, the change in me babe 
I'm on my knees babe 
Looking at you from across the way 

See her diamond earrings sparkle 
Hear the pounding in my chest 
I wish I had a dollar 
For every one of my regrets 

In the distance he's approaching 
The ghost of who I might have been 
As I walk home alone my 
Memory's my only friend 

Well they tell me....

They walk to the corner of 4th street and Broadway
Then take the first alley on the right
One of them asks a stranger, ""How 'bout a hand""?
And he gives 'em one finger at a time

Then they spot an old buddy with a bottle of heaven
Then pass around what means everything
One bottle for four, thank God, someone scored
And now the midnight choir starts to sing

Will they have Mogen David in Heaven?
Dear Lord, we'd all like to know
Will they have Mogen David in Heaven, sweet Jesus?
If they don't, who the hell wants to go?

Will they have Mogen David in Heaven?
Dear Lord, we'd all like to know

Away from the lights of the city
Where an old time preacher pitched a ragged old tent
Looked like it was a hundred years old

He started out preaching to no one
But pretty soon a crowd started gathering
And he preached the gospel
At the corner of Heartbreak Ridge and New Hope Road

I turned into a wild man
Some people said I'd gone crazy
But all too soon came the harvest
Of the wild seeds that I had sown

Well I stumbled into that meeting
I was looking like death warmed over
But then I heard the gospel
At the corner of Heartbreak Ridge and New Hope road

When they sing come ye sinners lost and hopeless
Lord I was hopeless heaven knows
Something got a hold of me something got a hold hallelujah
When I heard the gospel
At the corner of Heartbreak Ridge and New Hope Road

How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me.
His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

Bright shining as the sun.
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun.

But as long as we're nameless our bodies are blameless

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Comme mes parents et puis les leurs 
Ceux qui ramenaient de la mine d’antan 
Un peu de charbon dans leur sueur 
Je viens du Nord de l'hexagone 
On est dimanche il est vingt heures 
C'est ma terre depuis que je suis môme 
Mais là, j'y ai honte d'y être facteur 

Elle avait pourtant un beau nom 
Ma commune d'Hénin-Beaumont 
Mais vu la haine dans ses suffrages 
Moi je déménage 
Elle avait pourtant un beau nom 
Ma commune d'Hénin-Beaumont 
Mais vu la haine dans ses suffrages 
Je déménage 
Je déménage 

Sous la terre de l'hécatombe 
Je pense à mon grand-père enterré 
Il doit se retourner dans sa tombe 
Vu qu'il peut plus déménager 
Je préfère qu'il reste dans le noir 
Comme l'étaient ses ongles à la mine 
Et je suis pas sûr qu'il voudrait voir 
Flotter le drapeau bleu Marine 

Elle avait pourtant un beau nom 
Ma commune d'Hénin-Beaumont 
Mais vu la haine sur ses visages
Moi je déménage 
Elle avait pourtant un beau nom 
Ma commune d'Hénin-Beaumont 
Mais vu la haine sur ses visages

Je déménage 

Je suis rien de plus qu'un petit facteur 
Qui va au marché le mardi 
Et qui est très observateur 
Quand j'cligne de l'œil, j'photographie 
Et si je te dis bonjour des yeux 
En tendant tes lettres, tes factures 
Je sais qu'il y a une chance sur deux 
Que t'ai voté pour une ordure

Ma commune d'Hénin-Beaumont 
Mais vu la haine dans le voisinage

Et je pensais pas que c'était possible 
Comme si le chômage a vingt pour-cents 
Rendait la bêtise transmissible 
Le boulanger, les ouvriers 
Et même des immigrés aussi 
Comme si se tirer une balle dans le pied 
faisait courir plus vite Pardi 

Elle avait pourtant un beau nom 
Ma commune d'Hénin-Beaumont 
Mais vu que la haine n'est plus en cage 
Moi je déménage 
Elle avait pourtant un beau nom 
Ma commune d'Hénin-Beaumont

Gauvain Sers,"Mon petit chez moi est très spacieux
Puisqu'il occupe le tout Paname
J’ai pas le soleil, j’ai mal aux yeux
De voir défiler toutes ces rames
Je change tout les soirs de station
Pour tenter de briser ma routine
Aucun loyer, aucune caution
J’suis un clodo sur toute la ligne

Je maîtrise le moindre changement
Les raccourcis, les petits couloirs
C’est quand même mon appartement
Mais j’ai du monde qui passe me voir
J’ai plus aucune intimité
Pas les moyens pour une consigne
Enfin au moins je suis abrité
Je suis un clodo sur toute les lignes

J’observe les gens, leur quotidiens
Toutes les godasses des parisiens

Je me fais refouler, parce que je refoule
Pour oublier alors, je me saoule
Et puis je guette les uniformes
Les mêmes qui veulent pas que je dorme
J’crois que j’ai la phobie des insignes
Je suis un clodo sur toute la ligne

Je le connais sur le bout des doigts
Mon discours récité mille fois
Pour une pièce, un ticket resto
J’suis le perroquet du métro
Mais je ne travaille jamais le dimanche
C’est un métier de faire la manche
C’est mon crédo pour rester digne
Je suis un clodo qui suit sa ligne

Quand je bois le double d’un pack de seize
Je vois très trouble la ligne treize
Quand je bois rien, mon strapontin
A parfois le droit a un voisin
Et c’est le genre de petits plaisirs
Que tu piges pas ça va sans dire
Et je te le souhaites pas
Ça serait le signe que t’es le clodo qui écrit ces lignes
Putain, c’que c’est marrant la vie
Quand j’étais môme, bah moi aussi, 
J’évitais de lire dans leur regard
Toute la détresse de ces clochards

Au mur du Connétable
Si dans fond de nos verres
Il y traine des oreilles

Trop de prophètes, de pères, de saints
Mais aujourd'hui Charlie fait le beau
Avec son crayon a dessins
Tendu bien haut vers le ciel
Les abonnés, les infidèles
Les combattants de l’amalgame
Française avant d’être musulmanes

Ça sera a jamais historique
On a même applaudit les flics
Et j’en ai chialé d’émotions

Gauvain Sers,"C’était un gamin comme les autres 
Et c'est tellement dur d'en parler 
Je sais qu'au fond tout est de ma faute 
Comment j'ai pu être aveuglé 
Je me repasse tous ce qu'il a dit 
Et tout ce qu'il a pu me cacher 
Les longues heures sur son ordi 
C'est là qu'ils sont venus le chercher 

Et j'ai rien vu, j'en suis malade 
Mon fils est parti au djihad 
Et j'ai rien vu, j'en suis malade 
Mon fils est parti au djihad 

Il était comme tous les ados 
Plutôt gentil et réservé 
Jamais une seule personne ado 
Un ballon rond au bout des pieds 
Il rêvait d’être éducateur 
Avant de se faire endoctriné 
Par leurs discours de prédateur 
Qui flaire la brebis égarée 

C'est le cerveau en marmelade 
Que mon fils est parti au djihad 
C'est le cerveau en marmelade 
Que mon fils est parti au djihad 

C'était un gamin tout normal 
Qui a grandi près de Vesoul 
Puis la conversion radicale 
Le nouveau nom qui en découle 
Je ne souhaite ça a aucune mère 
C'est l'aller simple pour l'enfer 
Je peux pas croire ce qu'il a fait 
Je peux même pas refaire son lit défait 

Croyant aider des jeunes malades 
Mon fils est parti au djihad 
Croyant aider des jeunes malades 
Mon fils est parti au djihad 

Il avait l'age des premières clopes 
Et toute ma vie c'est arrêté 
Quand j'ai découvert cette enveloppe:
"" Maman il faut pas t’inquiété 
Je pars aider les jeunes syriens 
Promis je t'écrirai bientôt 
Je t'aime fort "" Et puis plus rien 
Plus de nouvelle, silence radio 

Je me revoie pleurer à la brigade 
Mon fils est parti au djihad 
Je me revoie pleurer à la brigade 
Mon fils est parti au djihad 

Mais merde c'était rien qu'un gamin 
Et hors de ma vue cette photo 
Avec un fusil à la main
C'est pas lui, pas mon Pierrot
Lui qui avait horreur du sang
Lui qui aimait les jolies phrases
Il a tué des innocents
Ils en ont fait un kamikaze

Il s’est fait sauter à Bagdad

Gauvain Sers,"J’peux pas bouger, je suis déçu
J’ai toujours du monde plein les pattes
Les Étudiants me grimpent dessus
Sans aucun diplôme d’acrobate
Une petite vieille qui les regarde
Se demande que fait la police
Sans remarquer qu’à l’avant garde
Le grand frisé c’est son petit fils

La serveuse a laissé ses tasses
Et me regarde en souriant
Elle a rendez-vous sur la place
Avec un tout nouvel amant
Y’a le clodo du coin aussi
Quand il a terminé sa bière
Qui pour me tenir compagnie
S’en vient pisser sur mon parterre

Même en hiver je ne crains rien
J’ai toujours mon bonnet phrygien
Et puis cette foule que je vois d’en haut
Quand elle m’entoure ça me tient chaud

Ça fait cent ans que je contemple
Ce qui arrive de rue du temple
Et ça fourmille et ça galope
Et ça s’embrasse, ça grille des clopes
Y’a des skateur qui viennent squatter
Y’a des photos qui sont ratées
Et y’a des militants partout
Maintenant des militaires surtout

Le jour où l’orage a frappé
Moi j’étais aux premières loges
J’ai entendu Paris pleurer
Et j’ai trembler dessous ma toge
Y’en qui pour me consoler
Viennent allumer des bougies
Au moins ça me réchauffe les pieds
Et ça m’éclaire un peu mes nuits

Et vient me chanter des chansons
Et me veiller pendant des heures
Et me tricoter un blouson
Avec des drapeaux et des fleurs

Un homme s’en prend aux journalistes
Qui l’interrogent pour BFM
Vous voyez bien que je suis triste
Respectez-moi un peu quand même
Non mais monsieur, je fais mon métier
J’suis à l’antenne dans un quart d’heure
Et moi aussi je suis effondré
Dit-il en piétinant les fleurs

Et puis près du kiosque à journaux
Une petite voix s’installe
Papa, papa regarde en haut
La dame elle montre les étoiles

Moi qui déplorait tout d’en haut

Gauvain Sers,"Tout les caviars du globes peuvent aller se rhabiller
Il existe bien plus noble sans l’odeur des billets
Je te parle de partage, comme une bière en terrasse
Qu’on se le dise, y’a pas d’âge, pas de régions, pas de classes
Tout le monde le savoure, quand arrive les beaux jours
Ce petit bonheur en tranche, le poulet du dimanche

C’est comme une religion où y’aurait pas de conflits
C’est comme des élections où y’aurait qu’un parti
La seule bataille peut-être, c’est pour l’aile ou la cuisse
Comme couloir et fenêtre, comme Ricard ou Pastis
Tout le monde à hésiter, sur la pointe des pieds
En retroussant les manches, le poulet du dimanche

Bien plus qu’un plat en sauce qui rappel la famille
Avec le ton qui hausse, souvent pour des broutilles
Un sot-l’y-laisse pour trois, un morceau de blanc pour deux
C’est une galette des rois où tout le monde gagne un peu
Même les végétariens, ne manqueraient ça pour rien
Personne peut être étanche, au poulet du dimanche

Tout le monde l’a vécu et chacun y a gouté
Je crois que même le sécu pense à le faire rembourser
Je pourrai te parler des heures de ses vertus sociales
Mais je te laisse pour l’heure, non c’est pas que j’ai la dalle
Mais le boucher va fermer, et je veux pas me retrouver
À être là comme un manche, sans poulet un dimanche",Le Poulet du dimanche,2017

Si t’as baigné dans une culture
C’est bien dans celle des haricots
Que tu équeutais à la dure
Sur une pile de vieux journaux
Mamie elle tricotait un pull
En écoutant l’ancienne France Bleue
Tu le mets toujours d’ailleurs ce pull
Disons que ça te la ramène un peu

Tout comme l’émission de 17 heure
Que tu écoute sur ton tracteurs
Tout comme l’émission de 17 heure
Sur ton tracteur

J’ai toujours aimé la moisson
Et puis j’étais pas bien matheu
Je me suis construit une belle maison
À 200 mètres de chez mes vieux
Je suis à la tête de l’entreprise

À la télé ils parlent de crise

Ont-ils déjà vu un tracteur?

Il aime pas bien les haricots
Et encore moins les équeuter
Y’a de plus en plus de vieux journaux
Toujours un pull à tricoter

I can hardly get to sleep
Wish for the hour that
The nighttime soon shall pass
And the morning dew will bring us
To a day our souls can last

Love has a reason
There's a meaning to the world
We're giving love

Situation candlelight
Enough to see the bits around you
But it's never very bright
Stare at a memory
You, through the grapevine, heard the truth
It's good to learn from your mistakes
But that only works in youth

Love has a reason
There's a meaning to the world
We're giving love

Restless minds, curtain calls follow fanfares
Troubled hearts, just a walk down the hall
Restless hearts, you take a punch just to land one
Troubled minds, it's only fair after all

Mounting, the trail, but you've got it in sight
Sometimes the only way is jumping
I hope you're not afraid of heights
Reach in my pocket for a bill that isn't there
And to face all of the undoings
Still isn't more than I can bear

Love has a reason
There's a meaning to the world
We're giving love
Giving love
Love, love
It's always been good to me
It's always been good to me

Love has reason
There's a meaning to the world
We're giving love",Meaning,2006

And when I kiss your soul, your body'll be free

Dressed in holiday style 
In the air there's a feeling 
Of Christmas 

Children laughing 
People passing 
Meeting smile after smile 
And on every street corner, you'll hear 

Silver bells, silver bells 
It's Christmas time in the city 
Ring-a-ling, hear them sing 
Soon it will be Christmas day 

Strings of street lights 
Even stop lights 
Blink a bright red and green 
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures 

Hear the snow crunch 
See the kids bunch 
This is Santa's big scene 
And above all this bustle, you'll hear

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey, and some mistletoe
Will help o make he season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And you pulled every punch that you had but there's one that you need,
Then you've waited too long,
There's a hole in your heart,
And all you've become is emotionally overrun

Wishing wells were made to echo a dime,
The consequences are you keep on relying,
You've become a run and hide refugee,

You've already disarmed it's your lasting alarm I pursue,
You can loosen those fists,
C'mon blow me a kiss,
You've been roughed up enough to deserve some relief from your troubles,
So I'm coming in

[Chorus]

Otherwise, I would never tell you what to do despite,
Any indecision though I know I'm right,
Arguing was always my forte,
And one thing I can say is I won't tell you lies,
Or treat you like a rental car like other guys,
And if you think I'm crazy find an alibi,
Cause you will need some evidence to show

So hard to please because you treated me so
Good that no one else could hold your make-up
Because of you girl I never want to break up

The difference I'm feeling in my heart
Is the difference of loving or not
And under the stars and moon and sun
Is the perfect becoming of one

So hard to please because you treated me so
Good that no one else could hold your make-up

Then I'd be lying 'cause I've made some mistakes

To try to get you thinking they really care,

Don't let nobody put you down, who your with
Take the pain of protecting your name,

Fell for the women just when I met her,
Took my sweet time when I was bitter,

And she knows how to treat a fella right,
Give me that feeling every night,
Wants to make love when I wanna fight,
Now someone understand me,

Out the many broken back doors and windows,
Through the valley of the love of the lost,
Is a hole that is cut through the souls falling down
From the thrones without leaving any windows,
But you drown in a piece for the moment,
The moment was over in time,
Then its gone the hit and run the tactless one has a short life

Fell for the women just when I met her,
Took my sweet time when I was bitter,

Wants to make love when I wanna fight,
Now someone understand me,

Gonna tell you what you do to think you practice what you preach,
Now I know there's nothing we cant preach,
Cause the heart can't erase once it
Finds a place to be warm and welcome,
To be held in shelter

You said those beautiful things
She thought you spoke things you mean

Caress her skin like it's glass
She hears your voice making plans
And she just breaks in your hands

You don't wanna see somebody beg
As you feel her heart surrender
You begin to fall
How do you say that something's through
When it never even started
At least not for you

You breathe her air and you leave
You keep your mind on yourself
And lie the glass on the shelf
After the heavenly speech
Your body throws holy heat
The angels sing when our eyes meet

It wasn't a lie but it wasn't true
I just wanted to make you feel good
Just wanted you near
I wasn't prepared I wasn't thinking of you
That you could actually love me

Doesn't know what to believe

It must have been for a cause

Don't think about him anymore

But it was the kiss, it took me away
It's like he knew that I am fragile
He handled me like glass
And it hurts but it's what I deserve
Because I should have been more careful
With the others that I handled
I should have been
I should have been
And knowing this I know
That he'll get his
But I don't want the man to suffer
Oh not the way I am

To a naked virgin spring

That's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you
And listen to the radio
Hope
Hope there's a conversation
Where we both admit we had it good
But until then
It's alienation I know
That much is understood
And I realize

If you ask me how I'm doin'
I would say I'm doin' just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out
And I sit down
At a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say
I'm, not over you

Damn
Damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
And still your magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang
Doesn't matter how you throw me
Turn around
And I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you

If you ask me how I'm doin'
I would say I'm doin' just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out
And I sit down
At a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say

I stare at a picture of you
And listen to the radio
Hope
Hope there's a conversation
Where we both admit we had it good
But until then
It's alienation I know
That much is understood
And I realize

If you ask me how I'm doin'
I would say I'm doin' just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out
And I sit down
At a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say
I'm, not over you

Damn
Damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
And still your magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang
Doesn't matter how you throw me
Turn around
And I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you
 
If you ask me how I'm doin'
I would say I'm doin' just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out
And I sit down
At a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say
I'm, not over you

And if I had the chance
To renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then
 
If you ask me how I'm doin'
I would say I'm doin' just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out
And I sit down

And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say
I'm, not over you

I failed algebra and I misused some times
We're at war again, save the world again
You can all join in, but you can't smoke inside

You said ""Take me home, I can't stand this place
'Cause there's too many hipsters and I just can't relate""
You're my neon gypsy, my desert rain
You're my ""Helter Skelter"", oh how can I explain that

You're the best I ever had
And I'm trying not to get stuck in my head
But I read that soda kills you and Jesus saves
On the bathroom wall where I saw your name
You're the best I ever had
I won't be the same

Night sky full of drones, this neighborhood of clones
I'm looking at the crowd and they're staring at their phones
They groom the coast line here, the sun will disappear (Oh God!)
And maybe once a year, I think they'll clean my car

Caught my reflection, drop the call
I've been medicated with cigarettes and alcohol
I got vertigo, no I can't see straight
I got obligations though I'm usually late but

You're the best I ever had
And I'm trying not to get stuck in my head
But I think I dropped my wallet in Santa Fe
Lost the only picture I had of you that day and
You're the best I ever had
I won't be the same

Traveling where the westerly winds can fly
Somebody tried to tell me
But the man forgot to tell me why
I gotta count on being gone
Come on Momma
Come on Daddy
Please what do you want from me?
I’ll be strong, I’ll be weak

Please celebrate me home
Give me a number
Please celebrate me home
Play me one more song that I’ll always remember
That I can recall whenever I find myself too all alone
I can make believe I’ve never gone
I never know, never know, never know where I belong
Sing me home

Play me one more song that I’ll always remember
That I can recall whenever I find myself too all alone
I can, I can celebrate

She whispers and laughs through my head ...

I'd do anything, anything, just to keep out of line, 
Just to stay out of line and never to be next!

One touch of skin commits us a new
Your moist inside, my ease so rich I tremble
The sweetest strain it tears me asunder

A waste so dry where is my love?
I wander lost a time that feels like hours
Until I see a place that is green.

I would die for you, your eyes do more than kill...
I want to live.

What I'm trying to say since you went away, I live a lie.
I drink all day I'm never sober just to ease the pain,

Who will know when the rains will start?
My baby broke her promise, should I be upset?

Beauty disguises what it's holding back
Some days when her eyes shine, her thoughts are black
Like a little child she can do no wrong
And I'll pick her up each time she falls down

""meanwhile baby!... oh! sweet baby!""

Night's scent is her presence, night's secret her face.
I speak when she's sleeping, silent when she wakes.
Clouds gather and darken, our future foretell
Rains comin' often and loves a brief spell
Like the saddest word, she awaits her song
And I'll pick her up each time she falls down

We've got a lot to learn about love in this life...

In the palm of my hand, I'll hold a little you

A small town boy named 'saint divine'
At his red flamed hair they would laugh and stare
As he searched in vain for friends to find
His mother, father and brother too...
They told him ""...we don't see the world like you...""
So he blew a kiss, he waved bye bye
For love... it don't live here

""all the tears he holds inside... he gotta go away
...are the tears he must hide...""
Looking for love...

So he goes to a big and bright city
Where friends ecstatic are never cruel
Forgets the clouds grabs the silver lining
The lipstick boy can boogaloo
And life is just one crazy ball
'cause down at king tut tuts he knows them all
But the queen is still a queer
And love... it don't live here.

""all the tears he holds inside... he gotta go away
...are the tears he must hide...looking for.
Looking for love...
All the love he fails to find...he gotta go away
...will his dreams run out of time? ...looking for,
Looking for love...""

What one calls a sinner another will a saint
Who is to say what is right from wrong
It's Friday night! it's time to party

Anyway your body 'n' souls inclined.
Laugh you lovers at those who hate
In each an adam and eve entwined...

Things never change they fade away. The Church of Love ... it's law and disorder. We're meant to give more than we take. Calling Gods on high, it's in your name millions die, Silenced those who scream, no golden cold image can redeem, The tongue tells lies, minds deceive. I turn around and see a finger pointing at me.

Where in the world can I turn and look to? Things never change they fad away. The Church of Love ... it's law and disorder Where cheating hearts can kneel and pray. Put your feet on the water, play Jesus for the day... They say the times are a changin', we've woken to our ignorance, truly I believe but I find it hard to see.

So why say goodbye? why say no more?

Who's right? who's wrong? I shout, you scream
What pleases the eye, plagues the heart.
It's strange but true, we do as we're done by
I'm sorry for what I said, let's go to bed!
...the time has come to talk of things
Of shoes 'n' bells 'n' wedding rings
So why say goodbye? why say no more?

Why say goodbye? why say no more?

For I'm almost sure it's love

and when I'm sad...
I slide 

I have never kissed
A car before
It's like a door 

I have always always
Grown my own before
All schools are strange 

and when I'm sad...
I slide 

I have never never
Nailed a nose before
That's how the garden grows 

I could never understand 
The wind at all
Was like a ball of love 

and when I'm sad...
I slide 

watch now
I'm gonna slide
I slide....

New york city with a frog in her hand?

It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight
They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by a moon
You know I don't see you when she walks in the room

It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help
It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else
They say a secret is something you tell one other person
So I'm telling you, child

A man will beg
A man will crawl
On the sheer face of love
Like a fly on a wall
It's no secret at all

It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest
It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success
Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief
All kill their inspiration and sing about their grief

Over love

A man will rise
A man will fall
From the sheer face of love
Like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all

Love we shine like a
Burning star
We're falling from the sky

A man will fall

They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me
 
Diamonds are forever, hold one up and then caress it
Touch it, stroke it and undress it
I can see ev'ry part, nothing hides in the heart to hurt me
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, sparkling round my little finger
Unlike men, the diamonds linger
Men are mere mortals who are not worth going to your grave for

Makes you want to rage

Gravity like lunar landing
You make me wanna run till I find you
I shut the world away from here
Drift to you, you're all I hear
As everything we know fades to black

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I, never thought that I
Had anymore to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink, to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But, love remains the same

Find a place where we escape
Take you with me for a space
The city bus sounds just like a fridge
I walk the streets through seven bars
I have to find just where you are
The faces seem to blur
They're all the same

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I, never thought that I
Had anymore to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink, to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But, love remains the same

So much more to say
So much to be done
Don't you trick me now
We shall overcome
So all that's left is praying

But we, should have had the sun
We could have been inside
Instead we're over here

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
Too much time too long defending
You and I are done pretending

Had anymore to give
You're pushing me so far

Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams
Did it ever get this easy
Never in your wildest dreams

And the world is slowly turning
As it turns I see your face
Touch your eyes, your lips. . .space

We've arrived at the place 
Where they open hearts
And fill them up with love
Filled with love filled with love
This on is pumping for you
As a mad thing starts

Never in your wildest dreams 
Did you ever get this feeling
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams
Could it ever be this easy
Never in your wildest dreams

Everytime I think of you I always catch my breath 
And I'm still standing here, and you're miles away 
And I'm wondering why you left 
And there's a storm that's raging 
Through my frozen heart tonight 

I hear your name in certain circles 
And it always makes me smile 
I spend my time thinking about you 
And it's almost driving me wild 
And there's a heart that's breaking 
Down this long distance line tonight 

 I ain't missing you at all (missing you) 
Since you've been gone away (missing you), 
I ain't missing you (missing you) 
No matter what I might say (missing you) 

 There's a message in the wire 
And I'm sending you the signal tonight 
You don't know how desperate I've become 
And it looks like I'm losing this fight 
In your world I have no meaning 
Though I'm trying hard to understand 
And it's my heart that's breaking 
Down this long distance line tonight 

 I ain't missing you at all (missing you) 
Since you've been gone away (missing you), 
I ain't missing you (missing you) 
No matter what my friends say (missing you) 

 And there's a message that I'm sending out 
Via telegraph to your soul 
And if I can't bridge this distance 
Stop this heartbreak overload",Missing You,1991
Gavyn Wright,"There was a time when I would have followed you 
To the end of the earth
I was willing to share it all with you, the love, the hurt
I've seen you when your dreams were falling in the dust
But I never stopped believing in you
I always thought our love was strong enough
One you could hold on to

You never see it coming you just let it fly
On silent wings, silent wings
You can't hide what you feel inside 
And the fire has left your eyes
On silent wings

I see us in my dreams and we're dancing
I can almost hear the song
But the prayers they go unanswered
We both know, we're just hanging on 
I can feel the change but I'll never know the reason why 
The rug was pulled so gently from under my feet
I only know that something good has died
Between you and me, oh, it's just a memory

You never see it coming, you just go separate ways
On silent wings, silent wings
There's no more promises to break, our love has slipped away 
On silent wings

You never see it coming, but you know it has to end
Silent wings, silent wings
I will never be the same again
I feel the whisper of the wind of silent wings

Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun

To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell rock
What a bright time, it's the right time

Gavyn Wright,"Tu, per quello che mi dai
Quell'emozione in più
Ad ogni tua parola

Tu, probabilmente, tu
Sei stata fino a qui
Per troppo tempo sola,
Fino a convincerti, come me
Che si può stare da soli.

Perché, la solitudine
Che non sorride mai
Diventa l'abitudine
E non la scelta che tu fai

Ma ora che son qui
Il vento cambierà
E semberà più facile
Il tempo che verrà

La vita può soprenderti
In tutto quel che fa
E dove non lo immagini
Incontri la felicità

E sono qui con te
E non ti lascerò
Ti chiedo di fermarti qui
E stare insieme a te
E stare insieme a te

Sì, adesso ci sei tu
Nei sogni e nelle idee
Nell'immaginazione.
Tu, che sei vicino a me,
Così vicino a me
Che sei parte di me
Cosi dentro di te
Come una sensasione
Sei le parole e la musica
Per una nuova canzone.

Perché la solitudine
Non si riprenderà
La voglia di sorridere
Ora no.
E la felicità
Se ci sei.
Per quello che tu sai
fe lo sai.
Per quello che mi dai
anche tu.
Per un amore semplice
Ma grande più che mai

E non è un'abitudine
Il bene che mi fai
Anche tu
E l'allegria di viverti
Finchè vuoi.
Di averti accanto più che mai!

E adesso siamo noi
Io e te
Ci siamo solo noi
Solo noi

Sicuri di non perderci
Di non lasciarci mai.
Un'altra solitudine
Non ci riprenderà
E tu non te ne andrai.

And the black eyed girl, is she dead or alive?
’Cause I know what you are
And I know what you're going through

I wanna get high on you
Turning it on for you
I promise the sun and the moon
I'm gonna get high with you

Transmission, are you running blind?
You're a dead end girl on the edge of the night
And the lights don't ever seem
To reach your eyes

Transmission, at the end of the line
And you don't know how, and you don't ask why
Don't need a prison wall
To know you're free

I wanna get high on you
Turning it on for you
I promise the sun and the moon
I'm gonna get high with you

I wanna get high on you
Turning it on for you
I promise the sun and the moon
I'm gonna get high with you

I'm gonna get high on you
Turning it on for you
I promise the sun and the moon
I'm gonna get high with you

Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,1999
Gay Pearson,"How do you keep
The music playing?
How do you make it last
How do keep
The song from fading
Too fast

How do you lose yourself
To someone
And never lose your way
How do you not run
Out of new things
To say

And since you know
We're always changing
How can it be the same
And tell me how
Year after year
You're sure your heart
Will fall apart
Each time
You hear her name

I know the way
I feel for you
Is now or never
The more
I love the more

That in yours eyes
I may not see forever

In the album of my memory

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye

Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

Gayle Scott,"They said some men would be warriors and some men would be kings
And some men would be owners of land and other man-made things
And false love as the eternal flame would move some to think in
rings
And gold would be our power and other foolish things
But you who dream of liberty must not yourselves be fooled
Before you get to plea for freedom, you've agreed to being ruled
If the body stays a shackle then the mind remains a chain
That'll link you to a destiny whereby all good souls are slain
And it won't take long, it won't take too long at all
It won't take long, and you may say
""What has that got to do with me"" and I say,
""You mean to tell me that's all?""
Of three men in a desert wandering, one is knowing and two are
scared
They say time is in the river, but the river is not there
Dry in spirit dry in body two will lend themselves to death
And in grief one weeps into his hands and drinks his bitter
tears
'Cause it don't take long, it don't take too long at all
It don't take long, and you may say,
""I don't know what you're talking about,"" and I say
""You mean to tell me that's all?""
And as I stand before you now, I am hopeful in my rage
You know love has finally called for me, I will not wilt upon
its stage
But still smaller than my nightmare now do I print upon the page
Do we have to live inside its walls to identify the cage?
'Cause it takes so long, why does it take so long,
But it takes so long, and you may say,
""I don't really care what you're talking about,"" and I say,
""Are you trying to say you don't belong?""
I am my mother's daughter, but I have seen myself in you
It's this blessing that I follow now, and so I must speak true
I dreamed of thousands dying, it was you and you and you,
And while the city sleeps so quietly there is something we must
do
And it won't take long, it won't take too long at all,
It won't take long, and you may say,
""I don't know if I want to know what you're getting at,""
And it makes we want to say, ""So long.""
Because grief will come in measures, only grief alone will know
And you'll see it on your family, on your own face it will grow
And they'll try to keep you hungry, then they'll tell you to eat
snow
You know pride can be a moving thing if we learn the strength of
""NO!""
And it won't take long, it won't take too long at all,
It won't take long, and you may say,
""I don't think this has anything to do with me,""
""But did you ever think you could be wrong?""
At noon on one day coming, human strength will fill the streets
Of every city on our planet, hear the sound of angry feet
With business freezed up in the harbour, the kings will pull
upon their
hair
And the banks will shudder to a halt, and the artists will be
there
'Cause it won't take long, it won't take too long at all,
It won't take long, and you may say,
""I don't think I can be a part of that,"" and it makes me want to
say,
""Don't you want to see yourself that strong?""
Division between the peoples will disappear that honoured day
And though oceans lie between us, lifted candles light the way
Half will join their hands by moonlight, the rest under a rising
sun
As underneath the sun and moon, a ritual'd wailing has begun
And it won't take long, it won't take too long at all,
It won't take long, and you may say,
""I don't know how to be a part of what you're talking about,""
and it makes
me want to say, ""Come on!""
And beware you sagging diplomats, for you will not hear one gun
And though our homes be torn and ransacked we will not be undone
For as we let ourselves be bought, we're going to let ourselves
be free
And if you think we stand alone, look again and you will see:
We are children in the rafters, we are babies in the park,
We are lovers at the movies, we are candles in the dark,
We are changes in the weather, we are snowflakes in July,
We are women grown together, we are men who easily cry,
We are words not quickly spoken, we're the deeper side of try,
We are dreamers in the making, we are not afraid of ""Why?""",It Won't Take Long,1984
Gaylord Carter,"This land is mine, God gave this land to me
This brave and ancient land to me
And when the morning sun reveals her hills and plain
Then I see a land where children can run free

So take my hand and walk this land with me
And walk this lovely land with me
Though I am just a man, when you are by my side
With the help of God, I know I can be strong

Though I am just a man, when you are by my side
With the help of God, I know I can be strong

To make this land our home
If I must fight, I'll fight to make this land our own
Until I die, this land is mine",Exodus,1987

On this, our weddin' day
Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

I only know I must be brave
And I must face a man who hates me
Or lie a coward, a craven coward

Who could say things that
Weren't that funny
I said what does that mean

Then what do you expect from me
I don't believe in that
And I think you know that's true
What then would you rather have me do?

You can do whatever you want
Whatever you wish
You can do this 
Because I know you're just jealous

Bang my fists against the wall
And crack the bricks until they bleed

Then neither am I going to be

laying out the credit cards she plays Fortune.

But when you go you take me in an instant 
In this life, I'll give it time

It'll be alright, it will be fine

And I show you my sins, show me all your scars 
As we settle in, its written in the stars 
Your watery eyes got me send me floating 
And my weak heart is swimming with devotion

Cutting edge
A blade that brings us all to the slaughter

this time, set your heart free, set your love free (this time).

How can I be at ease when I know soon I'll lay my eyes on you,
I close my eyes imagining the moment that my dreams are gonna come true.
The way you wear your hair, the shyness underneath your smile,
the warmth of your embrace is gonna thrill me in just a little while.
I rushed right in before but right now I'm gonna take my time,
every moment we share I'm gonna savor like a vintage wine.

And when you kiss me (I'm gonna taste my lips) I won't let go,
and when you hold my hand, baby I won't say no 'cause...

Ooh baby I want ya, I can't live without ya no way,
I ain't never gonna love this way again,
no time to pretend, no, no, this time,
I'm so glad I've got another chance, mmm, to love you again,
Oh this time.

I can feel you closer to me, closer as the moment comes,
I thank God for another chance to love that very special one. (Thank you.)
Will he return my love I've held on for so many years,
I close my eyes to cry, then I heard you whisper in my ear...

I'm kissin' your lips, you're lovin' me,

With not enough to eat

It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see

That you can never quite recall.

We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Anarge with trimmins
System in it that have the projects tremblin'
Ya know nothin' about lettin' a few strays go off
Ya only reach for your hip when your two ways go off
Shots'll fly by your head
Your toup blow off
I ain't crip I'm just a blue gray show off
Ghetto fab I more than rap for my bucks
Keep two 9's on me like Warren Sapp from the Buccs
The word I'm ballin' be flowin' to the fed Jakes
And I keep chicks on my lap throwin' me head fakes
Nigga I walk around with the grams you stackin'
And me and Flex don't roll unless they Andrew Jackson
It's Brooklyn by me the crook the I-B ya even look
At ID you gettin' hooked to I-V

Oh, baby, oh girl, I do it all again
If I have to live my life, live my life I would

I would do it all again, all again, yeah
If I have to live my life all over, nope, oh, baby, yeah
I do it all again
(Yo everyday)
If I have to live my life all over
(Every hour you know, yeah)

Yo, yo, same hustle man, same struggle man
Yeah, I do it again, if I have to
Still the same way, still the game paid
Still the young nigga, still slang, yeah

I wouldn't change a thing and my mama did it all by herself
She sayin' the same pray, listen
You hear when she whisper
I get the chance I fix her, days that I slipped her

And my man the past, I tell him I love him
And I hug him before he pass
Raised his daughter as if she was mine
Still meet the same girl, still have mine, uh

I thank God the Melik meet Shawn
I throw the diamond up higher in every song
And only drama could do it again
Da hood don't love me, still I walk through it again hear me

I wouldn't change one fact if I have to come back
And I couldn't live black, got me
But mama love me, I'm from da ghetto
And only God could judge me

I would do it all again, I would do it all again
If I have to live my life all over, oh baby, yeah
I do it all again
(Aha, uh, yeah, what)
I do it all again, if I have to live my life all over
(I do it over, for real, same way)

Oh, I wouldn't change a thang, same shit the basic
Same house, same spouse, same pop's I came with
Same gun, same case, same niggaz I bang with
I be big right now before I change shit

Just roll me up an L and live life and just do what I do
It's all lovely when it's right
But when it's wrong, I just play along
Get hit bounce back like it's really nothin' wrong

And I still struggle, still bubble
No matter if I'm broke or rich I still hustle
Still get niggaz to test you is my life
And I do it all again,I do it twice

And I won't change a thang, maybe two
I bring Big and Pop back put them in the same room
Then I apolotic and make peace in da same room
Once a game dead then you know we all dead too, true

And then we back on the block
With the crack in da sack
I take it how it come from the bottom to the top
I signed wit Bleek and I'm ridin' wit The Roc and I

Would do it all again, do it all again
If I have to live my life all over, oh baby, yeah
I do it all again, for the love as it gain
If I have to live my life all over
(And I do it again, yeah, holla)
Oh, I would

Yo, I talk to my fam I lost and let them know
How I feel from my heart without them here no mo'
And is no lies, I do it all again from the start of my life
Till the night my mama die

I would it told her, I love and it all kept looses and close
Let her know I always be here for you
Apologize to grandma that for da stress I put her through
And to my dad I ain't mad at you

Even thought you wasn't there without you
I won't be here so I gotta be fair
Still don't love lost over here I swear
To my restin' road dawgz, yeah
(I do it all again)

Why changin' my resurrection
I be back and the style same strip
Back with the same click
Hustle in the game chips, explain this
If I have to live all over I do it
Let Barbara have his kidz all over watch me

Get it quick, servin' the pump liquor
Spend a little mo' time with my big brother Leek
Still be fam with Cease, Proof, Cali and Bleek
Holla and get low, probably when my life repeat, nigga

If I have to live my life all over, oh, baby, yeah

Gee,"Intro:
[Frost]: This is a dramatization. The names have been changed to protect
the innocent ones not involved in the stories I'm about to tell. So 
listen up and listen up well. Here are the true accounts and incidents 
and still to me, it makes no sense. Ignorance is a major role, but 
here's a fact I feel you can ignore no more. 

Verse One:  Frost

Homicide, on the murder scene
Another frustrated gang-related senseless slaying
Victim: a young product of the project system
The sad fact is nobody's gonna miss him
True, a few may stand in disbelief, but
The majority will sigh a relief
Because of the fact he was a menace to society
And gang violence was his first priority
So, now you take a look to see what this abouta
Someone quicka with the trigga, straight cold shot him
Dead, in a puddle of blood he lay,
Another typical day in the streets of L. A. 

Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene

Verse Two:  Frost
Ho-Homicide, and just for trying to act brave
Tryin' to be a hero sent you to a early grave
The violent death, it took place at around six
And eyewitnesses say that it went like this, 
There was this lady who was chillin' in a alley
Positive I.D. included that her name was Sally
Sally had just got off the bus from a job,
When she met three young thugs who decided to rob
A man heard the screams comin' from her mouth
Ran down the deserted alley just to check it out
And when he came across the scene,
He knew what was happenin', but by then it was too late
The thugs started blastin'
Now, asked in this situation, exactly what would you do?
If you heard someone screaming, would you go to the rescue?
My man, he tried, that's hwo he died
He was shot right between the eyes
Tryin' to do a good deed, shoot, that could've been me
I'm glad I'm not the one who must explain this to his family

Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder 
scene 
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Break it down!

Verse Three:  Frost
Homicide, it's also know as manslaughter
It can be a father, mother, son, or daughter
It can happen at anyplace, at anytime
It can happen as I'm runnin' down this rhyme
First degree murder, blood flows red
One day you're alive, the next day, you're dead
Nobody seen nothin', the suspect fled
Shot on the spot with a bullet to the head
As soon as it happened, everybody broke
Nobody seen nothin', and of course nobody spoke
Bein' questioned, it doesn't pay to rat-a-tat-tat
For if you rat, you might too get the gat,
And get added to the list of those who fatally died
In the statistics, that's known as homicide

Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene

Gee Morris,"This old heart of mine been broke a thousand times.
Each time you break away, I fear you've gone to stay.
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow, bringing you back again,
Hurting me more and more.

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside;
'Cause each day that passes by you got me
Never knowing if I'm coming or going, but I, I love you.
This old heart darling, is weak for you.
I love you, yes, I do.
These old arms of mine miss having you around;
Makes these tears inside start a-falling down.

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside;
'Cause each day that passes by you got me
Never knowing if I'm coming or going, but I, I love you.
This old heart darling, is weak for you.
I love you, yes, I do.  Yes, I do.

I try hard to hide my hurt inside.
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin'
I try hard to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin' the way you treat me,
Leaves me incomplete, you're here for the day, gone for the week, now
But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back.
I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it.
Tell the world about it 'cause I love you.
Yes I do. Yes, I do.
I love you.  This old heart darling is weak for you.
I love you.  This old heart darling is weak for you.

Gee Watts,"I won't look back anymore, after this
Pitch black, star bright, yeah that's my life
A bit of fire and ice
Watch friends, plot foes, stock ends and pot holes
'Cause when the tank hit the bank, it just got closed
Don't be stank in the paint cause the yak froze

Wish I knew back when I was strugglin'
If I plugged in and kept bustin'
I'd be buzzin', that'd make me super rich
Never knew my sufferin' over but
Cousin, I keep it up and gushin'
And tell all of my family, aunts and uncles, cousins to do the shit
Just gain power through all of the rain showers
No different, remain sour cause someone else's lame hours
Wish I woulda known to tell 'em all to start they own business
Make long digits instead of havin' a boss who talk at the wrong pitches
To fake friends, cause it's never enough
At hostile situations with folks, I learned it's better to bust
First, and you still a nigga no matter how much ya stuff's worth
You love who love you, do hug who does true
Connect the true blood to cuzz blue
So keep hopin' the Lord does show up
'Cause it'll never be no peace on earth for all of us
'Till this mug blow up

Locked up, I'm free still doing time
I'm stuck, on notes of some of mine
Incarcerated, sometimes I hate it
This is the sentence of my life

Ponderin' these thoughts while sittin' idle in this mezzanine
Feel my feelin's boilin' up, I'm simmerin' on everything
Goin' for the gold because it's shimmerin', but everything
That you encounter seems to be devoured, need a better team
Every thought and every dream, every plot and every scheme
Lurkin' around the corner is a hater waiting like a fiend
And choice of drug is negative, and they use it like a sedative
Success becomes the cause of this effect, abuse the medicine
You thinkin' you can let 'em in, partake in buildin' excellence
The serpents come in twos and they meticulous with they meddlin'
The feathers flock together, see the relationships we settle in
Got consequences so it's best to let 'em go, we blessed again
Disloyalty unfoiled, trynna justify they pestilence
I don't understand why they so demanding manic pessimists
I guess if I had to guess, I'd make an estimate, I guess that they
Was just afraid so watch us levitate 'till I'm at heaven's gate

Locked up, I'm free still doing time
I'm stuck, on notes of some of mine
Incarcerated, sometimes I hate it
This is the sentence of my life

Mmm, life sentence for fallin' out ya physical body
Illuminate my soul, officially became godly
I be the one, all of these demons runnin' from
Dumped a gun, lifted spirits, niggas deem me the chosen one
Phony family in my crowd, rappin' gap and loud
Facin' twelve in the pen, none of them niggas made a sound
None of them niggas round
Now the fame close and the name boasts
I'm 'posed to break bread bitch, taste toast
I should smoke them ungrateful bitches
They doin' the most to see what make you choke
It actually leave ya throat missin'
I'm on a mission to revisit kin and
My prime been hidden, trynna dine with women
Dipped and find this linen, try and find a business
I love who love Gee, fuck you if it's fuck me
That's just how it gotta be, cause I'm paper routin'
Tame nuisance, insane view and check on my lawn
Strange recruit me, guess when the god speakin' Strange Music

Geeez 'N' Gosh,"I pretend that I'm glad you went away
But these four walls close in more every day
And I'm dying inside and nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside and nobody knows it but me
Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a-tumblin' down
I can say it so clearly but you're nowhere around
The night are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me
How blue can I get, you could ask my heart
Just like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now, you know, I'll be loving you still
The night are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me

Geezer,"Invisible, the man on the street
The voice of silence, you don't want to meet

The drunk and the junkie, the woman who begs

Old and dying are obsolete
Children crying in the street

Invisible are everywhere

Invisible, victims of crime
Police and villains, wasters of time
Scapegoats and prodigals, social outcasts
Lost boys and girls, iconoclasts

The people who die for the drugs that you use
The wife that you batter, the husband you cheat

Geezer Butler,"Don't give me your line
Won't let it go this time
And make a mockery of this obscenity
It's gotten out of control
Some poor unfortunate soul
Will pay the price again, to feed your vanity

The fascist face of the day
Contributes blood to the fray
And wreaks his devastation on humanity
He hears his own people cry
As countless innocents die
He stands defiant in his own insanity

Another child denied their human right to a life
Free from the shackles that assure their slavery
The monster in human skin, employs abduction again
Collecting innocents

I see the global decline, while wealthy pockets are lines
The masses begging them to show some sympathy
Without a care in their heart, they let it all fall apart
Their twisted rationales have never made sense to me

It seems destruction is a form of success for you
These tragic visions of loss will never leave me
You try to justify the pain that you've brought
But you're out of line, you're out of line

They Machiavellian minds concoct their wicked designs
They think they're standing on the side of destiny
Constricting freedom again they've wrought the ultimate sin
They make pariahs of the sons of liberty

And in the name of their god they wage their war and applaud
The deadly dogma that controls society
Who fucking gave you that right? to spread perpetual night
Your holy rationales have never made sense to me

It seems destruction is a form of success for you
These tragic visions of loss will never leave me
You try to justify the pain that you've brought
But you're out of line, you're out of line

You know I can't imagine anything less from you
Not a single word from your mouth is worth believing
No way to rectify the havoc you've wrought
Know, you're out on line you're out of line

I fear it coming, hear it coming again
A new apocalypse in sight
I see it coming, feel it coming again
We won't capitulate this time

It seems destruction is a form of success for you
These tragic visions of loss will never leave me
You try to justify the pain that you've brought
But you're out of line, you're out of line

A small blue thing
Like a marble
Or an eye

With my knees against my mouth
I am perfectly round
I am watching you

I am cold against your skin
You are perfectly reflected
I am lost inside your pocket
I am lost against
Your fingers

I am falling down the stairs
I am skipping on the sidewalk
I am thrown against the sky

I am raining down in pieces
I am scattering like light
Scattering like light

Siento que tal vez
Ya sufrí lo suficiente
Tengo que lograr
Que no se vuelva evidente

Porque cada vez
Que yo te encuentro de frente
Las fuerzas se me van
Todo el tiempo se detiene

y es tu culpa que esté sufriendo (Tú me obligaste a esto) 
No quisiste darle otro intento (Estaba arrepentido) 
Te he extrañado y tú sabes cuánto (Te perdoné mil veces) 
No entiendo a qué estamos jugando 

Duele tanto verte
Duele no tenerte
Duele y se me cae el mundo cuando te veo (Cuando te veo)
Cómo superarte
No logro olvidarte
Duele y se me cae el mundo cuando te veo

Oye 
Te veo y me arrepiento
Te juro no te miento
Escapa de ese bobo y busquemos el momento
Pa' hablar de sentimientos
Lo que llevamos dentro
Lo que el pasado no ha borrado de todo este cuento

Y si te vas conmigo 
Te juro que no habrá testigos
Yo te necesito 
Recordemos lo que fuimos

y es tu culpa que esté sufriendo (Tú me obligaste a esto) 
No quisiste darle otro intento (Estaba arrepentido) 
Te he extrañado y tú sabes cuánto (Te perdoné mil veces) 
No entiendo a qué estamos jugando 

Duele tanto verte
Duele no tenerte
Duele y se me cae el mundo cuando te veo (Cuando te veo)
Cómo superarte
No logro olvidarte
Duele y se me cae el mundo cuando te veo

Aunque siempre has sido mi debilidad (Mi debilidad)
Hoy no juego más (Hoy no juego más) 
Cae el mundo cuando te veo
Aunque la razón no manda al corazón
Hoy te digo adiós
Cae el mundo cuando te veo

Duele tanto verte
Duele el no tenerte
Duele y se me cae el mundo cuando te veo (yo te veo)
Cómo superarte
No logro olvidarte
Duele y se me cae el mundo cuando te veo

Duele tanto verte
Duele no tenerte
