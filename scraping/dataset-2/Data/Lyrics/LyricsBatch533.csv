Katie Melua,"Got God on the drums and the Devil on the bass
If you wanna dance you better find a space
Between the horns and the angel face
Is this the night you're gonna fall from grace
With God on the drums and the Devil on the bass
With God on the drums and the Devil on the bass

No one cares in this raging town,
They can build you up or drag you down
Nothing's wrong or right, black or white
They're all trying to start a fight between

God on the drums and the Devil on the bass
If you wanna dance you better find a space
Between the horns and the angel face
Is this the night you're gonna fall from grace
With God on the drums and the Devil on the bass
With God on the drums and the Devil on the bass

This constant beat that you cannot hear
'Cause it hasn't changed for a thousand years
And you can hear this song my friend
But it never began and it will never end,

With God on the drums and the Devil on the bass
If you wanna dance you better find a space
Between the horns and the angel face
Is this the night you're gonna fall from grace
With God on the drums and the Devil on the bass

Some people lie for a living
Some people stoop so low
Some make a thing of forgiving
Well they don't care 'cause they don't know that

God’s on the drums and the Devil’s on the bass
If you wanna dance you better find a space
Between the horns and the angel face
Is this the night you're gonna fall from grace
With God on the drums and the Devil on the bass
With God on the drums and the Devil on the bass
And the Devil on the bass and the Devil on the bass","God on Drums, Devil on the Bass",2010
Katie Melua,"I’m going to find a happy
I’m going to find a happy
I’m going to find a happy place

Seven thousand eyes are watching
Marching home and no one’s touching
Army of the city workers
Secretaries, lawyers, brokers
Heading for a London station
Heading for a quick salvation
Oblivious to cherry cola
Trying to sell to every stranger

Stuck here it’s cold I’m standing
Hoping for some understanding
Only way to go is inside

I’m going to find a happy
I’m going to find a happy
I’m going to find a happy place

Seven thousand light years travel
Let my sense of time unravel
Trapped feelings are never ending
Send those weaknesses descending
Towards the earth’s red center
Let the fire rise and enter
Tap into the primal power
Rising like a giant tower

The energy receiving
Cut a hole right through the ceiling
People getting smaller as you fly

I’m going to find a happy
I’m going to find a happy
I’m going to find a happy place

(I’m gonna find a happy place) A happy Place
(I’m gonna find a happy place) A happy place
(I’m gonna find a happy place) A happy place

Find a star, send down a beam to where you are
An elevator of light taking you somewhere
Where you’ll always be loved

I have found that stress and nonsense
Puts me in zone of avoidance
Could my mind be moving faster
Pulling like a super cluster
Can be hard to trust a feeling
But believing ends in seeing

We’re going to find a happy
We’re going to find a happy
We’re going to find a happy place

(I’m gonna find a happy place) A happy place
(I’m gonna find a happy place) A happy place
(I’m gonna find a happy place) A happy place",A Happy Place,2010
Katie Melua,"Who is in that house?
I opened the door to see
Who is up the stairs?
I’m walking up foolishly

And at the end of the hall was a door
And I got pulled in by a sound
But I wish I’d never found

In the privacy of your own room
Where flowers in the wallpaper bloom
Where I just don’t understand
In the privacy of your room
Look away now, look away now
At the moon

Is somebody watching me?
You really shouldn’t see
Why did you climb that last stair
You found me unaware

What I’m doing now it’s my own
And I don’t want it to be known
And it has to just remain

In the privacy of my own room
Where flowers in the wallpaper bloom
Where you just don’t understand
In the privacy of my room
Look away now, look away now
At the moon

Puzzle me now with mystery clothes
These apples I love, these apples I loath
And always forgive the future to come
For stealing the light from the sun",The House,2010
Katie Melua,"I'd love to kill you with a kiss
I'd like to strike you down with bliss
I'd like to tie you up in knots
Until your heart stops

I'd love to kill you with a glance
I'd like to put you in trance
I'd like to drug you with my scent
And use you in the moment
Ooh

I'd love to kill you as you eat
The pleasure would taste so sweet
I'd like to open up your skin
And wander there within

I'd love to kill you by a stream
Where no one can hear my baby scream
And then I'd run away and be free
The sweetest victory
Ooh

I love to watch you in your sleep
'Cause you don't have power over me
And when you're awake I'm undone
Under you spell, in hell
Ooh",I'd Love to Kill You,2010
Katie Melua,"A moment of madness
It's happened before
It could turn into sadness or a civil war
You've got me changing all i ever thought

When you first got so mad lost your rag
Trying to save some trees
Angry cries, saw your thighs
And I fell to my knees
Oh my God what is it? 
It's a moment of madness

When we drank too much beer
Lost our fear
Our defenses were down
you got up tried your luck
Bought a dubious round
It can be hard to resist
It's a moment of madness

A promise of passion
A trailer of sin
A smiling assassin
The demon within Endorphins are raging
Resistance is thin 

And you're blowing my mind
'Cause I find that your theories of life
Are insane, feed my brain
I could listen all night
I can't leave till we kiss
It's a moment of madness

And I just wanna stare at your hair
And imagine you opening your door
In your drawer there's some leather in there
I refuse, you persist
It's a moment of madness

You know I'm not asking a lot
Only your life
I don't want to get what I want
But I'm gonna ask you to stop But I'm full of lies

When you first got so mad lost your rag
Trying to save some trees
Angry cries, saw your thighs
And I fell to my knees
Oh my God what is it?
It's a moment of madness

And I just wanna stare at your hair
And imagine you opening you door
In your drawer there's some leather in there
I refuse, you persist
It's a moment of madness",A Moment of Madness,2010
Katie Melua,"I never walked near the edge
Used to fear falling
I never swam far from shore
Never tried the secret door

But when you give me love
When you give me love

I have no fear of heights,
No fear of the deep blue sea,
Although it could drown me,
I know it could drown me

I didn’t wander in the woods
Used to fear the darkness
I didn’t like getting deep
I was scared of what I couldn’t keep

But when you give me love
When you give me love

I have no fear of heights,
No fear of the deep blue sea,
Although it could drown me,

Where I'll go or what I'll do
It makes no difference what I do without you

Oh I love you my darling
But I'll have to let you leave
Goodbye it's the last you'll hear of me

Well I found the bluebird
High on a mountainside
And the little bird would sing its little song

So I'll sigh, I'll cry
I'll even wanna die
For the one I love is gone.

Katie Melua,"My father is a doctor
He never told me
About this problem
That I've got

I've never had it
It feels awful
It must be something that I caught

I can't breath, I can't eat
I hallucinate in my sleep
I get a fever whenever you're near
Oh God it's suddenly clear

Ooh struck down by the plague of love
Sweet poison running through my blood
And I can't bear not knowing if you even care.

My mother is nurse
She can't help me
Though she spent her life
In the service of others

I told her 'bout my pain
But she was busy
Downstairs serving dinner for my brother

Now I can't get out of bed
I've got this crazy notion in my head
I hear a ghost in my bedroom lurking
Is it me or is the medicine working?

Ooh struck down by the plague of love
Sweet poison running through my blood
And I can’t bear not knowing if you even care

Ooh struck down by the plague of love
Sweet poison running through my blood
And I can’t bear not knowing if you even care.

Maybe nothing can save me
So come a little closer
I've got a secret just for you

Ooh struck down by the plague of love
Sweet poison running through my blood
And I can’t bear not knowing if you even care

Ooh struck down by the plague of love
Struck down by the plague of love
Struck down by the plague of love",Plague of Love,2010
Katie Melua,"I put my heart in a red balloon
But I let it go to soon
Let it go on the boulevard
Where wicked winds blow so hard

Maybe had I looked up I would have seen that

The sky is full of red balloons
Red balloons are full of broken hearts
Broken hearts are floating by a chance
Will they burst or drift
Into arms
Will they burst or drift

I put my voice in a red balloon
For you it sang too many tunes
Haunted by those melodies

Katie Melua,"Ooh baby I’m twisted
Ooh baby I’m twisted

I shouldn’t keep dreaming of you
It’s something I swore I wouldn’t do
My friends say don’t go there
It’s a road to nowhere

But you got through
And I can’t undo
This thing I feel for you,

Ooh I’m twisted, just twisted
Entranced by the dance that you do
I’m twisted, so twisted
I wanna twist and turn with you

Ooh baby I’m twisted
Ooh baby I’m twisted

Out on the street, I meet you again
This beast inside is counting to ten
We’re all alone
We’re near my home

And we go in
Like a mortal sin

I wanna twist and turn with you

Katie Melua,"All over the world
People must meet and part,
There's someone like me
Feeling the pain in the heart.

Someone may meet again
Under the same bright star,
If maybe some night
You come back from afar.
Who cares if tonight
I don't know where you are.

Are you thinking of me now?
Missing having me around?
If you have forgotten me
My world will come tumbling down.

All over the world
Others are sad tonight
There's someone like me
Watching the sun´s fading light.

There is the same warm glow,
Here under that star

Wherever you are that I still love you so.
Wherever you are that I still love you so.",All Over the World,2012
Katie Melua,"I used to dream myself to somewhere else each night
I dreamed in color, 'cause I lived in black and white
Until I chanced upon this road that led to you
I couldn't see how anything could be

Better than a dream
Stranger than my wild imagination
If this is a real sensation
It's better than a dream
Higher than the moon
Hazy like a beautiful illusion
Crazy and in confusion
And better than a dream

I used to wish I was beyond some distant door
I knew there must be more to life
And now I'm sure
No dreams of pirate caves
Or Indian braves, or magic carpets could
Ever be this good

Better than a dream
Stranger than my wild imagination
If this is a real sensation

The bit that I don't get
It's how it changed so fast
How it changed from we will always be together
To it will never last.

When you told me you were tired of it all
That's the bit that I don't get.

I do! 
But no longer the fool beside you
And I'm learning from the pain
Won't be doing that again!

I was just a fool didn't hear them say
Love is like a wild wood

Something in the way I was lost and found
Something made it feel right
Spirited away by a haunting sound
Calling in the deep night

They told me not to listen to the cry of the lone wolf
Next time I won't listen to the cry of the lone wolf

Shining through the twilight
Then you slipped away as the flames grew higher

When you're falling in love
There's a silence, the ending darkness feels
When you're singing with love

Remembering life, a good blessed life
I'm forgetting all my troubles
I'm forgetting all my troubles

There's a summer, a frozen heart recalls
When you're breathing with love
There's a pathway, the silver candle shines
When you're seeing with love

Remembering life, a good blessed life
I'm forgetting all my troubles
I'm forgetting all my troubles

There's a quivering, the waken forest gives

That all the rain clouds are fountains
Though our troubles seem like mountains

There's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose heart
Give the day a chance to start

Where do you think you're going so fast?
We're apt to think it's cruel, but sometimes
It's a case of cruel to be kind

And if we get up off our knees
Why then we'd see the forest for the trees
And we'd see the new sun rising
Over the hills and horizon

There's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose faith

Forever or just for a little while.

We'll drink some champagne, we'll look at the stars
And do it again cause baby the world is ours.
You're like an angel playing with my heartstrings.

Sometimes I think we're only,
On a day trip to Disneyland.
But remember that night you got lonely
And asked my daddy for my hand.

Talking all night and dancing until we fall.

We picked a flower and climbed the hill
Above the lake
And secret thoughts were said aloud
We watched the faces in the clouds
Until the clouds had blown away

Were we ever somewhere else
You know, it's hard to say

I never saw blue like that before
Across the sky, around the world
You've given me all you have and more
And no one else has ever shown me how
To see the world the way I see it now
Oh, I, I never saw blue like that

I can't believe a month ago
I was alone, I didn't know you
I hadn't seen you or heard you're name
And even now, I'm so amazed
It's like a dream, it's like a rainbow
It's like the rain

Somethings are the way they are
And words just can't explain

I never saw blue like that before
Across the sky, around the world
You've given me all you have and more
And no one else has ever shown me how
To see the world the way I see it now
Oh, I, I never saw blue like that before

And it feels like now
And it feels always
And it feels like coming home

I never saw blue like that before

Staring back at me, it's blacker than the night
I'm awake but still sleeping
I keep telling myself I'll be alright (I won't)
And I know it can't get worse than today
Sitting here and she's trying to rehearse what to say
See, she's in the bathroom hoping I'm not in earshot
While she's getting used to the sound of a teardrop (Splash)
It hits the tile
And I know it's been a while since you seen me
Smile and laugh like I used to
I've been in denial since it happened
Just take me to the past
'Cause I just can't imagine losing you (too)

I can't believe this is happening to me
And could someone please shut this fucking answering machine
So I can start leaving these messages
That you will never get
And all these cries for help
You'll never see and never check
But I guess it's easy for you to leave me
But believe me
See this isn't something that Imma just forget
I would trade it all for one more minute
Don't you see I really need you to talk to
I'm still sitting here wondering who did it
While I'm staring out our front door
Knowing you'll never walk through
Said you'd come right back
And now you're gone like that
A blank stare as I stand so alone
And know you're never coming home (damn)

Katie Viqueira,"Déjenlo a mi corazón
Que siga contento y nada más
Déjenlo que cante alegre
No quiero que tenga algún pesar

De fiesta en fiesta andará
Hermano será del carnaval
Con un grito bien salvaje
Que tiemble en los montes el supay

Que vea salir el sol
Maduro y caliente en el tunal
Y a los pájaros que trinan
Dan ganas de echar un achalay

Alegrate corazón
Esto te lo puedo asegurar
Mientras quede un santiagueño
La chacarera no morirá

Todo es fiesta para mí
Después de la lluvia contemplar
El color del horizonte
No sé qué pintor podrá pintar

La primavera traerá
La flor amarilla del chañar
Y el zumbar de las abejas
Que van trabajando su panal

Sombra del algarrobal
Comienza la tierra a florecer
Tata Dios ha de regarla
Cerquita ya del amanecer

Alegrate corazón
Esto te lo puedo asegurar
Mientras quede un santiagueño
La chacarera no morirá

J. on the other end, she waiting to exhale
Cop a baby L blat, do as, I'm bangin' in that back
She got pictures of me, bangin' in that back
So we gon', laze up, in my tunes
And lock up for days in a hotel room
Pull the pink thong to the West (West)
Prepare to insert billy bong in ya chest

Ain't no shit bumpin' like this one

If the slightly miss their mark they ring untrue
But something 'bout goodbye making someone cry

Be the mother whose heart
Has to somehow go on

On all the cheap talkers – needing me, feeding me lines
Give me somebody who's tender but tough

Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
From wanting far too much for far too long
Looking back, I could have done it differently
Won a few more moments, who can tell?
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know, I know him well

Wasn't it good, Wasn't it fine
Isn't it madness he can't be mine
But in the end, he needs a little more than before
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well

No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side
And though I move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide
Looking back, I could have played it differently
Learned about the man before I fell
But I was ever so much younger then

Wasn't it good (oh so good), 
Wasn't it fine (so fine)
Isn't it madness he can't be mine

Didn't I know how it would go

Katryna Nields,"She is waiting in line for a meal that is free
There's a boy with a beard and a patch on his knee
She already knows what the conversation will be
This happens again and again

She asks where he's sitting and is he alone
He smiles with his teeth; he's a long way from home
He has eyes that are blue, he has hair that is blown
This happens again and again

""You seem like the guy that I've been looking for
Your eyes are so thoughtful and bright
How long must we act like we're just making friends
When I already know that you're right?""

The feeling comes over her once and so clear
It was difficult last time when she tried to steer
And she asks herself, ""Am I making love to the mirror?""
This happens again and again

""Your eyes are the color of autumn skies
Your hair is so golden and bright
Your body is all that a woman's should be
Won't you come home with me tonight?""

Then she starts from her chair in a moment of thought
To remember her first love and the lessons he taught
And how very easily she could be bought
This happens again and again",This Happens Again and Again,2002
Katryna Nields,"I took a plane to Paris to remind me what I've lost
And I spent the day in a sidewalk café writing
I wrote thirty postcards all to you and every one said
'Having a good time, wish you were here'

I was supposed to meet Maria, but we got our signal crossed
So I walked along the Rive Gauche multiplying
I bought raspberries and the Daily News
And something to take home to make you happy
I hope it works, it'll have to

And I dreamed last night
Of how the moonlight shines in your old room
And the fight that put me on this flight that brought me here
With no one to talk to

I took myself to the cinema and mostly closed my eyes
But every now and then I paid attention
And every now and then there was a word I understood
I got the joke and that's enough for today

And I dreamed last night
Of how the moonlight shines in your old room
And the fight that put me on this flight that brought me here
With no one to talk to

I took myself to the cinema and mostly closed my eyes
But every now and then I paid attention
And every now and then there was a word I understood
I got the joke and I wrote it down and put it
On a postcard and sent it to you

I push in to the middle the sound becomes a part of me
Taking me back to that sweet familiarity
Making my adrenalin rise I feel the eyes on me

Sip the bottle now don't be slow

Looking in all the wrong places
Won't let history repeat in parallel lines

I need somebody to knock me out

I just need someone to talk with me

Still searching for someone to walk with me

I wish I had a pure embrace
To keep me warm until the sunrise

Let nothing in the way of us

Katy B,"I push all my problems to the back of my mind
Then they surface in my dreams, they come alive
I sweep all my issues to somewhere I can't find
In hope that I'll forget but there's just so many times

Why can't I be strong and just confront all my fears?
When my fear is hurting you by being sincere
But how many more days can I run? How many years?
Emotions flooding and now it's all seeming so clear

Crying for no reason, feel the tears roll down
I felt strong but am I breaking now?
Crying for no reason 'cause I buried it deep
I made promises I could not keep
'Cause I never faced all the pain I caused
Now the pain is hitting me full force

I push all my problems to the back of my brain
A darkness deep inside where I just can't find my way
How can I walk with a smile? Get on with my day
When I deceived myself pretending it's all okay

I tried my best to hold it all together, I know
The strings have worn away and now I'm all exposed
I try to hide it all away on top of the shelf
I can lie to everyone but not to myself

Crying for no reason feel the tears roll down
I felt strong but am I breaking down?
Crying for no reason 'cause I buried it deep
I made promises I could not keep
'Cause I never faced all the pain I caused
Now the pain is hitting me full force

Forgive me now
'Cause I said that I'll be there for you
Care for you
I let you down, I walked away
'Cause there were things I couldn't say to you
Say to you
I'm breaking now

I burned some bridges down
There must be some way out
The voices speak so loud
Will you forgive me now?

Have you really any idea
Of how you could hurt me

And although you're out of sight
Would you still be the same if I was next to you tonight?

How come these wounds won't heal

Now how could I compete
With something bigger than the both of us
Why were we not good enough
We gave it all and watched it burn away
But the ashes still remain
I wonder what it is you say
When you close your eyes, what do you ask for when you pray
What do you need to sooth your soul
Why can't I find something else to make sense of it all

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I've been alone, and lonely, 
and I know the difference now. 
I know you can hold someone tight in your arms, 
and still be alone, somehow. 

I've been in love, and I've made love, 
and I know the difference now. 
I've touched and I've felt someone touch me inside, 
now that you've shown me how. 

I've watched the distance between us 
fading into the night. 
And I've felt love grow in the darkness 
til it was brighter than the morning light. 

I've had my share of lovers, 
but lovin's so different now. 
You touch me and suddenly I'm not alone, 
I feel like a lost child who's finally come home, 
and for the first time I feel really alive, 
yes and I know the difference now. 
For the first time I feel really alive, 
yes, and I know the difference, now.

Katy Moffatt,"Carlos Zaragoza left his home in Casas Grandes when the moon was full
No money in his pocket, just a locket of his sister framed in gold
He rode into El Sueco, stole a rooster called Gallo Del Cielo
Then he swam the Rio Grande with that fighter nestled
Deep beneath his arm.

El Gallo Del Cielo was a rooster born in heaven so the legends say
His wings they had been broken, he had one eye
Rollin' crazy in his head
And he'd fought a hundred fights, and the legends say
That one night near El Sueco
They'd fought Gallo seven times, and seven times he'd
Left brave roosters dead.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in San Antonio
I have 27 dollars and the good luck of your picture
Framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all on the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo
And then I'll return to buy the land Villa stole
From father long ago.

Outside of San Diego, in the onion fields of Paco Monteverde
The Pride of San Diego lay sleeping on a fancy bed of silk
And they laughed when Zaragoza pulled the one-eyed
Del Cielo from beneath his coat
But they cried when Zaragoza walked away with a
Thousand dollar bill.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in Santa Barbara
I have fifteen hundred dollars and the good luck of
Your picture framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all on the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo
And then I'll return to buy the land Villa stole
From father long ago.

Now the moon has gone to hiding and the lantern light
Spills shadows on a fighting sand
Where a wicked black named Zorro faces Gallo del Cielo in the night
But Carlos Zaragoza fears the tiny crack that runs across his rooster's beak
And he fears he has lost the fifty thousand dollars riding on the fight.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in Santa Clara
Yes, the money's on the table, I am holding to
Your good luck framed in gold
And everything we've dreamed of is riding on the spurs of Del Cielo
I pray that I'll return to buy the land Villa stole from father long ago.

Then the signal it was given, and the cocks rose
Together far above the sand
El Gallo del Cielo sunk a gaff into Zorro's shiny breast
They were separated quickly but they rose and fought
Each other thirty seven times
And the legends say that everyone agreed that del Cielo fought the best.

Then the screams of Zaragoza filled the night outside
The town of Santa Clara
As the beak of del Cielo lay broken like a shell within his hand
And they say that Zaragoza screamed a curse upon the
Bones of Pancho Villa
When Zorro rose up one last time and drove del
Cielo through the sand.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in
San Francisco
I have no money in my pocket, I no longer have
Your good luck framed in gold
I buried it last evening with the bones of my
Beloved Del Cielo
And I'll not return to buy the land Villa stole from
Father long ago.

Do the rivers still run muddy outside of my beloved
Casas Grandes?

Oes the scar upon my brother's face turn red when
He hears mention of my name?
Do the people of El Sueco curse the theft of Gallo del Cielo?
Well, tell my family not to worry, I will not return
To cause them shame.",Gallo del Cielo [Live],1997

In a pancake house down near the Rio Grande 
Well the waitress said, ""I don't know you from diddley
To me you look like one more tired old man""

Well he walked all alone down on Main street 
Was a hot wind blowin' up from the south 
There were two eye's starin' in a pawnshop window 
A whiskey bottle lifted to his mouth

There was no moon shinin' on the Rio Grande 
A truck of migrants pulled through town 
The jukebox was busted at the bus depot 
When Haley's comet hit the ground

Well he blacked out all the windows in his bedroom 
He was talkin' to the ceiling and the walls 
Then he closed his eyes and hit the stage in 1955 
And the screams of the women filled the hall

There was no moon shinin' on the Rio Grande

And he orders up two coffees to go 
He tells the waitress, ""Baby, we just found the body
Of someone who was famous long ago.""

Katy Moffatt,"Downtown tonight, I saw an old friend, someone who 
I used to take comfort from long before I met you
And I caught a spark from her eyes of forgotten desire
With a word or a touch, lord, I could have rekindled that fire
But old flames can't hold a candle to you
No-one can light up the night like you do
Flickering embers of love - I've known one or two
But old flames can't hold a candle to you
Sometimes at night I think of old lovers I've known
I remember how holding them helped me not feeling so alone
Then I feel you beside me and even their memories are gone
Like stars in the night, lost in the sweet light of dawn
Old flames can't hold a candle to you
No-one can light up the night like you do

Once you've had a taste of perfection

Where do I go
I guess second best
Is all I will know

Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you

What you would do if
You were the one

Was looking into your eyes

You're like an Indian summer
In the middle of winter
Like a hard candy
With a surprise center
How do I get better
Once I've had the best
You said there's
Tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test

He kissed my lips
I taste your mouth
He pulled me in
I was disgusted with myself

You're the best
And yes I do regret
How I could let myself
Let you go
Now the lesson's learned
I touched it I was burned
Oh I think you should know

I wish I could be Wesley Willis
My words would flow like honey
Sweet and laid on thick
You're so edgy
You don't even need a rhyming dictionary

So they say you've got a CD
And they claim you can barely read

Is as simple as it seems

About your eccentricities
What I mean to say
Oh, is that I need you listen please

It's still as simple as it seems

Caught in the eye of a hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town pulling me down

Can't find the way cause the way is gone
So if I pray am I just sending words into outer space

Looks like I'm letting them down

When you cant afford half the shit they advertise
Oh I'm worth more then they ask more then the two-tag generation full of regret
Oh I won't settle no, oh I can't settle

I wanna break the mold, I wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air I'm not going down with out a fight
It's my life
And I'm sitting on the sidelines watching

It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints on you

Representing you and me
Don't you wanna go down in history?
Rather then end up begging on the streets
Trading under table favors for a place to sleep
'Cause I'm worth more then this so stop writing prescriptions for my Ritalin
I can't focus my attention

I wanna break the mold, I wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air I'm not going down with out a fight

Walk the allies in the dark
Sleep with candles burning
I leave the door unlocked
I'm weaving a rope and
Running all the red lights
Did I get your attention
'Cause I'm sending all the signs and
The clock is ticking
And I'll be giving my two weeks

Pick your favorite shade of black
You'd best prepare a speech
Say something funny
Say something sweet
But don't say that you loved me

'Cause I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for awhile
This sickness has no cure
We're goin' down for sure
Already lost a grip
Best abandon ship

Maybe I was too pale
Maybe I was too fat
Maybe you wanted better, better luck in the sack
No formal education
I swear way too much
I swear you didn't care
'Cause we were in love

So as I write this letter and shed my last tear
No, it's all for the better
That we end this here
Let's close this chapter
Say one last prayer
But don't say that you loved me

If you want me you better do better than that tonight.
Oh, Oh.
If you want me, it takes more than a wink,
And more than a drink and more than you think.
If you want me you're gonna' have to break the bank, tonight.
Cause some don't have the patience, some call me high-maintenance
But you pay the bill, cause, that's the deal.

If you wanna ride, just name your price don't play cheap, with your heart
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check, for me, for me.
Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me

If you want me, I'm not a piece of ass, a one night stand, a storage ship
I think you better walk by, tonight
Oh, no.
If you want me, then stop begging I don't put out for charity
If you want me there's no discount price tonight
But I don't need your dollar bills I just want something real
Cause, nothings free, except a lovin' me

If you wanna ride, just name your price don't play cheap, with your heart
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check, for me, for me.
Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost

When you keep it all on mute
How will I know the right way to love you

Usually the Queen of figurin' out
Breaking down a man is no work out
But I have no clue
How to get through to you

I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knockin' on wood, hopin' there's a real boy inside

But you're not a man
You're just a Mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man

I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in and make you talk
Even pull a string for you to say anything

But with you there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts
And I can't seem to find your heart

I'm such a fool
I'm such a fool
I'm such a fool
This one's outta my hands
I can't put you back together again

Cause you're not a man
You're just a Mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man
You're just a, a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy
And understand
But you're not a man

If the past is the problem
Our future can solve them baby
I could bring you life if you let me inside baby
It'll hurt but in the end you'll be a man

I didn't scream
'Cause I can belch the alphabet
Just double dog dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I take these suckers down cause they just
Get in my way
The way
You look at me
Is kinda like a little sister
You high-five
Your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters

So I don't want to be one of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance
To prove to you tonight
I just wanna be one of the girls
Pretty in pearls
Not one of the boys

So over summer something changed
I started reading Seventeen
And shaving my legs
And I studied Lolita religiously
And I walked right in school
And caught you
Staring at me
'Cause I know
What you know
But now your gonna' have to take a number
Its OK
Maybe one day
But not until I get my
Diamond ring

'Cause I don't want to be one of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance
To prove to you tonight
I just wanna be your homecoming queen
A pin up poster dream
Not one of the boys

I wanna be a flower
Not a dirty weed
And I wanna smell like roses
Not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day
Your gonna' wanna' make out make out make out with me

Into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee
Under my skin
A mark from wiping out
It brings back the memories
Every bone's been broken
And my heart is still wide open

I can't stop
Don't care if I lose
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted too

With each scar there's a map
That tells a story
What a souvenir of Young
Love's like jumping out
An airplane riding a tidal
Wave on an ocean of emotion
My heart rips me wide open

I can't stop
Don't care if I lose
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted

But we break it)
And I can't stop seeing stars
(Lets hope not die)
Whenever you're around
Around

Don't care if I lose

Cause when I'm with him

In the middle of winter
Like a hard candy
With a surprise center

You said there's
Tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test

I taste your mouth
He pulled me in

Are like feathers from a bird

I managed to fit both my hands and feet
All my little white lies
Smell like a big old bucket of bleach

In one ear
And out your other
So lock and key
You won't open up for me

So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh between you and me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving giving up

And it feels like you're in China
And I am in Peru
When ever I am sleeping next to you
We can hear the crickets singing
Oh all throughout the night
OH boy can we just get used 
To something so right'

And sure I confess
I'm a mess
I'm a mess of mistakes
But please count to ten
Before you go and throw it all away

Out of the ocean
And grew legs
And they started walking
And the apes climbed down
From the trees
And grew tall
And they started talking

And the stars
Fell out of the sky
And my tears
Rolled into the ocean
Now I'm looking
For a reason why
You even set my world
Into motion

Cause if you're not
Really here
Then the stars
Don't even matter
Now I'm filled
To the top with fear
That it's all
Just a bunch of matter

Into the grey sky
And see a thousand eyes
Staring back
And all around
These golden beacons
I see nothing but black

I feel the weight of something
Beyond them
I don't see
What I can feel
If vision
Is the only validation
Then most of my life
Isn't real

You were such a surprise
An unexpected gift
Said I was pretty, and I believed it
Not really used to all this attention
Told myself I don't deserve you
And this is just a phase
Could I get used to, being loved the right way?
I wanna argue, but there is nothing to say

Oh love, I think I'm ready
Ready for it

Oh love, I think I'm ready

Cause you send me flowers, when there's no occasion
Yeah we talk for hours, you still wanna listen

Was full of secrets locked up tight like iron melting
Running on empty, so out of gas

Laying on the bathroom floor
We were living on a fault line
And I felt the fault was all mine
Couldn't take it any more

By the grace of God (there was no other way)
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out
That way

I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water
When the truth was like swallowing sand
Now every morning
There is no more morning oh I
Can finally see myself again

It was not about me

Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical, tonight (oh, oh)

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary

Go down in history
Go down together, into infinity, forever
You're Cleopatra
You're blushing Juliet

I wish I didn't do, but I did
I lost my own, my own identity
Forgot that you picked me, for me

I found I had to love myself, the way I want you to

Love me, no more second guessing
No, there’s no more questioning
I’ll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings, or changing seasonally
I’m gonna love myself, the way I want you to love me

That I could just unzip, and strip
But who I am is who I'm meant to be
And it's who you are in love, in love with
So now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
You're gonna have to take a back seat
I know I have to love myself, the way I want you to

Love me, no more second guessing
No, there’s no more questioning

The robbers were right
It's there as if the ...
Holding it tight

I cleaned out the door
Like a spy ...

Lost my mind
Lost my mind last night
Woke up smiling something wasn't right
Sang a song in a major key
Something was wrong
My mind was gone
I was
Happy
Crazy

Always thought I knew how
Tall my smile would stand
Turns out who I was not
Is now who I am
All the lights were on
And this song is worse than caroling

Lost my mind
Lost my mind last night
Woke up smiling something wasn't right
Sang a song in a major key
Something was wrong
My mind was gone
I was
Happy
Crazy

Just because
I have tea and green leaves
Doesn't mean I'm a crackhead anymore

I bet that we could light up the sky

Sometimes I feel so isolated
I wanna die

When I don't want a thing
I just want to live it

The sun rising from the river
Nature's miracle once more
Will light the world

But this light is not for those men
Still lost in an old black shadow
Won't you help me to believe
That they will see a day a brighter day
When all the shadows will fade away
That day I'll cry, that I believe
That I believe

The sun now embraces nature
And from nature we should learn
That all can start again
As the stars must fade away

Is what I say, best run the other way
In case of physical breakdown...y'all can break now
My kitchen full of heat, if you can't take the temp
Make yourself exempt

P**** footin' around don't be gettin' y'all nowhere but stuck
Nowhere to duck, pull his file, n****z die
By gettin' blasted, how drastic
They got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do

I got the nerve to serve you up just like a raider do, but naw (naw, naw)
I take that back, that's my problem
Turnin' and walkin' away, this ain't goin' work when they be robbin'
As long as Big Boi's still livin', never standin' by my lonesome
Step up n****, if you want some

[Chorus: x2]
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We havin' a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that ses in yo chest (It's the joint)

Well n****, you softer than silicone, used to pump up tits
It's that n**** down in the Dungeon with them playeristic hits
I'm quick to stop a sucka flow like menopause, it's the
Original ghetto bastard, so now I makes a switch

I used to sell dope, but in 1994
I'm makin Southern playalisti cadillacmuzik
But see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscin'
About the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens

She had me makin' better grades to make a better life
But I never had no love or respect, 'cause we goin' be alright
I ran the streets and broke my curfew 'cause I gave a s***
I carried guns and butcher knives 'cause I was steadily in the mix, yeah

It was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now
I'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now
I call the wild because it's time to take the streets
So if you ain't got the burner, bring your big enough nuts (retreat)

I'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal
Just an international playa, comin' through your stereo

[Chorus: x2]

3-5-7 to your fo'head, there'll be mo' dead
'Cause I'm a po' kid
So Lord forgive me, I got to keep my milly right here near me
When I be doin fine until these n****z want to clear me off my street

But in my hood hood, they hollerin' ghetto
Don't have no neighbors that hit the pipe but never let go
But I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you
Ain't s*** that we can do but rest in peace, pour a brew

On the concrete, remember when we ran deep
Remember at the party when we served them n****z dandy
They know not to test us, test me, do me, try me
Trippin with that drama, my Beretta's right beside me

One is in mid-air and one is the chamber
Y'all ask me what the f*** I'm doin', I'm releasin' anger
Quick to dodge danger, I'm takin' it one day
At a time, I got the fattest dimes around my way

You can sway with Andre, I'll take her to the ho-jo, b****
Just let you know, yeah

[Chorus: x2]

It's on my friend, on the road again, I'm travelin'
No more than 65 on 85 off in my Cadillac
I got that n**** Dre, he ridin' shotgun
And got my pump under my seat, in case these yougstas want to have some fun

I'd do it if I have to, bustin' caps with this a heat and load it clip up after clip
And after again, if I feel it
The glock, the gat, the nine, the heaters
See I be bustin' caps like my amp be bustin' speakers

So how do you figure that Big Boi beats ghetto blastin
You 'posed to be quickest draw, but man, I hail 'em faster
1-2-3, you need to think about the future
Before I shoot your a** and dilute your gut with lead

From my hollow clips, I'll send you to an early grave
You f***in slave, you better try another way
To take me out, is truly something difficult
Don't even run up on me, unless you want your brain broke

I'm out of bullets lettin' loose my last clip
I'm a kick you in your a** and your n**** gettin' pistol whipped
You know that's how I do, you know that's how I do

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah and it don't stop and it don't quit, to the muthaf***in'...
Organized Noize, PA, Goodie Mob, Big Gipp and all the n****z
Around the East Point way

Kavalier,"Yeah, Scientific Shabazz, the Holy Psychiatrist
Coming down with that spiritual rain
Six thousand years of darkness
Four hundred years of pain
As I attract the wicked into the Sunz of Man Court
He shall be tried for his ways & actions
Death shall be his penalty

As I embellish, mentally I nourish
Resuscitate a mindstate that has perished, you shall inherit
his blood I require back, to Earth
we rise out of spiritual darkness, six thousand year curse
The lost disciples, bound, to the midst of the
bottomless pit, trapped behind the gates of the wicked wilderness
I hear the sound of the trumpets, blowing across the heavens
It's calm, prepare, for the storm, of the seven
Shabazz, the Disciple, the holy, exalter
Condemning those, who sacrificin, babies on the altar
I hear the cries of innocent black babies who are aborted
and unmercifully slaughtered
Loud screams echo, skulls of angry slaves
turning over in their graves
The white sheets are like white flags, you need to wave it
To the soldier, of the Lord, the warrior King David
I come to kill and crucify, those who trick and lie
In the eyes, of the most, high
The pale-face, devil race, caucasoid germ
Grafted, from original, black man's sperm
Thin-blooded weak, grafted-brain punk
Your power's a third of mine, you drunk funky skunk
How dare you use Jesus name to shell your filthy religion
My tongue be the sword, to slash you with precision
The justice system is his, the court'll only acquit him
And eighty-five percent of y'all are going to hell with him
The walls of hell, are closing in, disciples, we rose again
the Sunz of Man, chosen men
Like lightning, striking, from the East
The Holy Psychiatrist, 4th Disciple, and Killah Priest
Unlimited volts, of energy, striking, the enemy
The righteous vicinity, death be the penalty

So come on and swing it low, sweet chariot
Pick up your righteous load, and yo then carry it
To a new home, and i-dentity
For my people, death'll be the penalty
Uhh, and for my folks I mad a-love
Keep your eyes on the prize and you'll rise above
And yo Shabazz, make sure you sing it loud enough
Peacein out to the righteous stay rugged and rough
And y'all get on down, come on now get on down
Swing it low sweet chariot, get on down
Come on now get on down, swing it low sweet chariot

Lawd, I'm in this culture
The microphone and I'm joinin
Sharpen your sword, we must be aware
Them trick knowledge, they use to deceive us
You've been plagued with the mental diseases
You worship false portraits of Jeehsus
The grafted image, of worshipping Ceasear

I hear the snap of my great great grandfather's neck
in a noose, hangin from a fuckin tree whipped-in mentally
abused, visions of great great cousins
Runnin across the field, unarmed
Ran down, and killed
I be the star to dispel the darkness
Cast upon your soul by inhabitants of Mount Caucus
Who praise the dead, and not the true and living
Killed Jesus and said, that he died for their religion",Sunz of Man Court (Death Be the Penalty RMX),1999

Won't you wait for me in heaven?

She ain't worried of the hotel, I wouldn't even get to motel, 
Mess around and take your girl from you then sell it to for the... 
Oh... have her back, wont' love but I love the stacks
So I'm pulling up and then you know what
They looking at me like what is that

[Chorus]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, 
That's what they've been calling me, 
Soon they see me roll up, roll up
Don't know what to call that
So they call, they call, they call it
Hold up, hold up, hold up, 
That's what they call it.
Hold up, hold up, hold up, 
That's what they call it.
Soon they see roll up, uh, roll up, 
Don't know what to call that
So they call, they call, they call it
Hold up

Told Brad to send me a track, 
He send me a track to sound like a trap, 
I don't know normally do this, 
But hey when I do it sound like the trap, 
Competition left me in flat, I'm just hoping that you trap, 
I'm just hoping you try to try me, 
Get drag around by your suit tie, 
You can catch me in the forn city, 
They don't even know I rap, 
First album when platinum so they ain't many places on my map, 
Going golf in Iraq, going shopping in Dubai
She'll be asking the man forgives and gives me the gift form Dubai
Bottle water with a mouse trap, no rat can get to my cheese
Her... get no scraps get no bad like her ratches
Wanna book me for five G's, 
Read the sign and say stop please, 
Can't knock me, my trunk knocking, 
My making woman looking knock me, 
Call me but I'm unreachable, too trill to be speaker too
God loss in my own garage and they couldn't find me for a week or two, 
My trunk are open like pickable, 
Me I'm... to be sipping through, 
Came to blue, all my speakers blue, but I turn em up and my speakers do.

[Chorus]

Hold up man, just hold up man, 
Rap to state then pour down, 
Chew up cheese then throw up grants, 
Then guess some bread you know I'm jam, 
It's lunch time, she got one friend, but just one fine, 
One four, one dime, you already know which one is mine, 
Tripping like Jessy Jay, see love and got me in the... day
If it comes between hoes and dough I drop off chick and then scoop you pay, 
Might as well, I might as well, passing up dough is a major feel, 
Take the trip to South Africa, but can't lead the the paper like... pill, 
Realest rapper you have ever meet, she want n autograph on her fake breast, 
Too young is just too dumb, girl slow it down and take a break twist, 
Check it out when my lack is out, 
Don't worry bout it, I ain't stressed, 
Hot chocolate on my hallo tips they might mess around and get a taste test.

The children's laughter saying they're skipping just like the stones they threw
The voices echoed across the ways it's getting late

It was just another night with the sunset and
The moonrise not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars listening to
Papa's translations of the stories across the sky, we drew our own constellations

The west winds often last too long
But when they come down nothing ever feels the same
Sheltered under the Kamani tree waiting for the passing rain
Clouds keep moving to uncover the sea
Stars above us chasing the day away
To find the stories that we sometimes need
Listen close enough all else fades
Fades away

Kay Adams,"Big Mack was a driver of a semi rig from Denver to the coast of Maine
And every truck driver and highwayman well they all knew big Mack's name
He stepped into a diner by the scales where he stopped to weigh
He looked at me I'm the waitress there and we all heard him say
Pour me a piece of coffee pass me a cup of bread
Why you're the sweetest things that I've ever seen and there's a ringin' in my head
Make my eggs a medium rare over easy now with my steak
I'm gonna buy you a farm in Texas gal if it takes everything I make

Well I stood there a starin' at Big Mack kind of in a state of shock
I told him when she set his orange juice down be careful Mack it's kinda hot
I've already buttered your coffee the toast is in your cup
Your french fried soup and scrambled prunes will soon be coming up
Well I took her apron off grabbed her coat down off the rack
Took Big Mack's arm and told my boss I'm a quittin' and I won't be back

Just like all the others I played for in the past
Why can't I be a leader and play a leading part
Why must I always have to play second fiddle in your heart
So play fiddle play will there never come a day
When I won't have to play the part of second fiddle in your heart

You said you were snowbind in Idaho haulin' some heavy load
And when you lost that rig and done her pass honey you said you'd quit that day
You swore that run would be your last but ha that'll be the day
Promises promises...

You know Judy's gonna marry the boy next door the one that you've never even met
You told me that you'd get the drive away but well I know that you'll forget

We're lonesome and wantin' you home with us but that'll be the day

Just to pass the time away this had been her longest day

The way she colored everything all wrong
But this chill came over me as I realized that she
Had colored things as she felt baby long
She colored mommy blue with brown eyes crying
She made our house as grey as the dawn
She made the sun as black as night as if to say it had no light
But she didn't color daddy cause he's gone
Oh yes I'm so blue and I've been crying and our home is as grey as the dawn

The AC on, providing how the truth feels
Cold, chilly chill like our demeanor be

You might lead it like the intro got it
You might be it and proceed to believe it, it takes you to be you

Saw it for the taking and wanted a piece
Saw it for the taking and made 'em believe

Is on a stake and not a cross, blood stains on the floor

I bring the stake wit me and keep it as memorabilia

Made sense like as if I was there when they was offing it

I never shook the feeling of the mood that y'all was in
I never shook the feeling of the newest model Benz
But I stopped thinking that rappers and producers was my friends

And it turns out loyalty just wasn't in their cards

Where the heights are getting higher 'til they grew up outta place
And the lights are getting brighter so you shooting by the stakes
And your aiming get erratic tryna move em out the way

To find that I'm forsaken

Kay Davis,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails.

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales.

Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.

Ah yes! I was wrong
Again,
I was wrong.

Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.
Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be, while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too",Lush Life,2001

And it suited me fine 
That the leaves had started 
Turning and it was cold outside 
Because the sun surely shined 
The autumn ought to come 
You used to say you liked it 
Well I still like it 
I never got your message 
I didn't think 
That you cared anymore 
Now that you're out in Los Angeles 
You kind of closed that door 
But soon I'll need some warm air 
I'm coming out in November 
Will you be there? 
Will you be there? 
In the fall 
Tell me could the reddest tree 
Definitely give you something 
To figure out? 
Or is that impossible now? 
I wore that red fuzzy sweater 
Through the frosty grass today 
And it made me feel so safe and warm

Now he's leaning on my shoulder,

Blonde Haare, knappes T-Shirt
Ihre Haut goldbraun, ja, ich steh auf

Schon allein wie sie dich ansieht
Und den Style, wie sie sich anzieht
Alles edel, ihre Nägel
Orgasmus, wenn sie ei'm die Hand gibt
Augen wie Bambi, Candy Parfum
Yves Saint Laurent
Ihre Art, wie sie redet
Du merkst, ihr Daddy hat Knete
Doch das ist mir egal
Ich mein, ich lass mir doch eh nix bezahlen
Ich will nur endlich mit ihr ausgehen

Heut' ist es mir egal was auch immer du machst
Klar tut's weh mit anzusehen wie du dein Ding machst
Letztes Jahr noch überlegt welcher Ring passt
Letztes Jahr noch im Urlaub
Und ich vermiss' es  was interessieren mich die Bitches
All dieser Luxus scheiß auf Champagner,
Scheiß' auf die Partys, dass Geld ich war dankbar,
Dass ich dich traf das war Schicksal auf der Miss Wahl
Als ich dich sah und ich dachte echt das mit uns passt
Wir sind Erwachsen also 'nen mir den Grund Schatz,
Deine Augen haben gelogen du bist schön doch vergleichbar mit Rosen
Niemals anfassen es könnte weh tun
Ich hab ein Herz aus Stein doch ich geb's zu.

Schatz ich wünscht' du könntest dich durch meine Augen sehn'

Du wolltest frei sein und so wurd' ich eingetauscht

Ich hass' es dich zu lieben
Außer diesem Schmerz ist mir nichts geblieben
Wir waren zu verschieden Streitereien und irgendwie
Genieß' diese Einsamkeit, ich höre oft
Man hat dich hier und dort gesehen mit ihm gesehen
Du konntest nicht Wiederstehen
Auf dem Tisch rumgeknutscht warst nicht zu retten
Dom Pérignon Schlacht mit Servietten
Drei vier Typen Kontakt ausgetauscht eine Frage
Sag wie krass bist du drauf?
Ich erkenn' dich nicht mehr das bist du nicht
Erzähl mir nicht dass du glücklich bist erzähl mir nicht
Dass es sich gelohnt hat, lüg' nich'
Wer macht dir jetzt Frühstück
Wer ist jetzt da wenn du krank bist
Wenn's dir schlecht geht
Du bist weg und es tut echt weh, ich hasse dich.

Deshalb gab's für mich keine Abschlussfahrt
Egal, was war, ich bekam
Immer die Schuld, die Geduld war nicht mehr da
Jeden Mittag saß ich meine Strafe ab für nichts
Was, Frau Meier, warte ab, du Bitch
Kenneth, wieder kam da ein Brief
Hör, du bist gar nicht beliebt
Voll unsympathischer Typ und so hart zu erzieh'n
Viele Lehrer sind stark depressiv
Du musst geh'n, also verließ

Viel Glück euch Freaks, ich komm nie wieder zurück
Doch hab ich irgendwann Erfolg, dann trifft's euch tief
Ich hab ein Plan, ja, ich werd einfach Rapper ist klar
Ihr wisst jede Scheiße besser
Irgendwann ausschlafen, keine Wecker
Und ohne Grund in meinen Scheinen blättern
Und dann in 'nem Maybach wegfahr'n
Währenddessen fahren Neider S-Bahn

Kay One,"Hey ich bin's
Ich weiß nicht ob deine Nummer noch aktuell is' umm
Ich wollt mich bei dir melden und dir sagen
Dass es mir gut geht und
Ich hier halt glücklich bin und umm
Drum schick ich auch meine Nummer nicht auch nicht mit
Ich glaub es is'besser so
Aber tu mir bitte ein Gefallen und pass auf dich auf
Bis dann tchau

Ich denk an uns und schreib diesen Text jetzt
Ich vermiss dich immernoch und es stresst echt
Mein Pech wächst seit dem Tag
Als du mich verlassen hast, komm allein nicht klar, immer
Partys hier, Partys da, du bist gegangen
My first love, ja, ich hatt' kein Geld
Ich hatt' kein Fame, damals hieß ich noch Kenneth
Es gab kein Kay doch du hast mich geliebt
Geliebt wie ich bin, vielleicht war ich ein Arsch
Doch Liebe macht blind, aber du warst da, mein Superstar
Ich hatt' kein Problem mit dem Zug zu fahren
Egal wo du warst, ich bin gekomm'n
In der Zeit kannt' ich kein Dom Perignon
Ich war broke und ich konnt dich nirgends einladen
Aber trotzdem sprachen wir vom Heiraten
Lass mich dir eins sagen
Ich vermiss diese Zeit
Wär so gern wieder glücklich vereint, aber nein

Dieses Leben ist kein Wunschkonzert
Ich hab ein' wunden Punkt im Herz

(My first love) Ich will die Zeit zurückdrehn'
Und mit dir ein kleines Stück gehn'
(My first love) Noch einmal nach Paris
Kein Geld, doch wir warn' verliebt
(My first love) Schatz, ich sag Dankeschön
Für die Zeit, es tut mir Leid
(My first love) Wo du auch bist und was du grad tust
Ich hoff' dir geht's gut
(My first love)

Bis jetzt hat's noch keine geschafft
Mein Herz zu bekommen, ich vergleich dich, mein Schatz
Mit jeder Frau die ich kennenlern' und es nervt echt
Keine hier ist perfekt
Manche sind sehr nett, hey und manche nur hübsch
In manchen steckt auch 'ne Bitch
Es ist wie es ist, es kommt wie es kommt, Schicksal
Als die Quittung kam war klar, ich zahl
Ich sah bei uns Zukunft, doch vielleicht waren wir zu jung
„geh mit ihr gut um!“, drohte dein Daddy
Ich hatt' kein Geld doch kaufte dein Blackberry
Denn mir war's egal, ich hab dich geliebt
Und ohne dich leben, macht depressiv
In der Nacht so aktiv, du raubst mein Schlaf, kein Scheiß
Und da hilft kein Geld, da hilft kein Hype
Denn wahre Liebe kannst du nicht kaufen
Die eine unter 100.000

Dieses Leben ist kein Wunschkonzert
Ich hab ein' wunden Punkt im Herz

(My first love) Ich will die Zeit zurückdrehn'
Und mit dir ein kleines Stück gehn'
(My first love) Noch einmal nach Paris
Kein Geld, doch wir warn' verliebt

Hab dir gezeigt, was ein Candlelight-Dinner ist
Wir tranken Weißwein und schon allein dein
Sommerkleid bleibt mein Highlight, ich lieb dein Style
Dein Outfit war heiß, ich mag dein
Auftreten, du könntest echt ein Star sein
So viel gelacht und diskutiert
Danach hab ich gesagt, woll'n wir nicht zu mir?
Ich könnt dich massier'n, dich studier'n
Ich hab noch ein Geschenk und es ist kariert
Doch es liegt bei mir, jetzt liegt's an dir
Ob wir bald losgeh'n, es wird nichts passier'n
Außer Kuscheln, und du grinst selbst
Wir müssen los, Baby, es wird um 5 hell
Und was in Stuttgart passiert, bleibt auch in Stuttgart

Ich wollt dir nicht wehtun, du hast noch geschlafen
Ich bin gegang'n, ohne etwas zu sagen
Keine Nummer, kein Zettel, hart, ich weiß
Das war nicht nice
Das war nicht cool und ich bin auch nicht stolz drauf
Ich schieb's bestimmt nicht auf den Vollrausch

Ich hoff so sehr dass du ihn dort oben liest,
Ich konnt mich nichtmal verabschieden, nein,
Deswegen stehn hier auf dem Blatt diese Zeiln',
Wir warn' nicht da, als es passiert ist,
Ich würd echt alles tun, dass du wieder hier bist,
Ich zünd 'ne Kerze an, und die ist nur für dich,
Wünsch mir so sehr, dass du 1 Mal noch zu mir sprichst,
Nur noch 1 Mal mit uns in der Runde sitzen,

Sogar meine aller erste Freundin,
Meine Eltern, Brüder, Onkels, die Tanten,
Und keiner hat's verstanden,
Ihr macht euch Vorwürfe, ihr macht euch Sorgen,
Doch mir geht's gut, hier bin ich geborgen,
Ihr müsst jetzt wieder leben, ich möchte dass ihr lacht,
Und keine Angst, ich bin da, ich seh was ihr macht,
Küss die Jungs von mir, ich vermisse euch,
Wir sehen uns wieder, in Liebe, dein bester Freund!

Es war dein Wille, dass ich ein ganz großer werd,
Doch momentan bin ich dumm ich muss noch soviel lernen
Ich bin auf Party hier, ich bin auf Partys da
Mach krumme Dinge weil ich grad auf mein Ferarri spar
Und ich genieß' mein Leben und zwar in vollen Zügen
Sitz im Privatjet, ich fahre nicht in vollen Zügen.
Verschleuder mein Erspartes in den Automaten.
Wir bleiben arm und die andern hab Haus und Garten
Heute König, morgen Penner.
Scheiß drauf wir hatten Spaß
Und deswegen leb ich weiter in den Tag, aber wenigstens
Kann ich mein Kindern was erzählen ich habs gesehen.
Das Ghetto und die Crème de la crème

Und wenn ich irgend, irgendwann im Himmel bin,
Dann kann ich sagen ich hab alles erlebt,
Lehn mich zurück und zünd mir da 'ne Kippe an.
Denk an die Zeit und hab alles gesehn'
Ich hatte Top Frauen, durch rappen mein Geld,
Gereist um die Welt, kenn' die teuersten Hotels,
Ja wenn ich irgend irgendwann im Himmel bin,
Ja dann weiß ich, ich hab alles erlebt.

Ich hab alles erlebt,und ich setzte auch Trench,
Damit Bushido auf der Bühne vor 10.000 Fans,
Ich hatte dich hübschesten Frauen,
Viele waren Prominent,
Ihr kennt die Namen selber, wen hab ich schon alles gebangt?
Hand aufs Herz, ich bereu' nichts,
Ich halte ewig diesen Kurs,
Versuch zu lachen, dieses Leben is zu kurz.
Wenn du Traurig bist und sterben willst
Denk an die Leute die so traurig sind weil Sie sterben müssen.
Inzwischen Lach ich wieder.
Ich komme wieder klar,
Alles wunderbar, mir scheint die Sonne aus dem Arsch.
Ein wundervoller Tag,
Ja heute Lad ich alle meine Freunde ein,
Und schenke jedem Straßenpenner heute teuren Wein.
Ich lebe jeden Tag als wär's mein letzter
Jeden Tag Geburtstag, Weihnachten, Silvester
Aber wenigstens kann ich mein Kindern was erzählen,
Ich hab's gesehn, Das Ghetto und die Crème de la crème

Und wenn ich irgend, irgendwann im Himmel bin,
Dann kann ich sagen ich hab alles erlebt,
Lehn mich zurück und zünd mir da 'ne Kippe an.
Denk an die Zeit und hab alles gesehn'
Ich hatte Top Frauen, durch rappen mein Geld,
Gereist um die Welt, kenn' die teuersten Hotels,
Ja wenn ich irgend irgendwann im Himmel bin,
Ja dann weiß ich, ich hab alles erlebt.

Ja ich hab immer schon gemacht was in mein Kopf war,
Denn dieses Leben es ist viel zu kurz und Kostbar,
Ich hab schon immer gern getan was falsch war
Vielleicht lag es an meiner Reife und dem Alter

Ja ich hab immer schon gemacht was in mein Kopf war,

Mich wieder zu verlieben, doch es geht nicht mehr

Häng ab mit den Bitches, doch es bringt nicht viel
Ich red mir ein, es geht vorbei
Ich entschuldige mich hier für mein Herz aus Stein
Ich wollt das hier alles nicht und ich bin's Leid
Sie geht nicht vorbei, sie geht nicht vorbei, die Zeit

Du regst dich auf, dass ich ein Playboy bin, doch ich versteh's
Verdammt mein Herz wurde gebrochen von ner Bitch,
Erzähl mir nix von Liebe und glücklich zusammen sein
Ich saufe den Moët auf Ex und fick' die Vergangenheit
Shoppen geh'n in München, Handtasche von MS
Und wenn ich mal kein Geld hatte, war ich ihr zu schlecht
Hab' ihr jeden Wunsch erfüllt, doch was bekam ich? Nichts
Außer Streitereien und Rumgeschreie, dismissed
Ich wurde ersetzt, kein Problem, und der Respekt ist seit diesem Tag
Weg, seitdem die Liebe, krass Pech
Scheiß auf die Ex, ich musste mich jetzt ablenken
Von dem Tag an zählt Kay One zu den Nachtmenschen
Jeden Tag nur Partys, Frauen die dein Geld wollen
Models, die bei Koks den 500er so schnell rollen

Doch 'ne Prinzessin wie 'ne Königin
Doch momentan bin ich womöglich blind
Ich seh' in jeder Frau 'nen Teufel, ich weiß
Deswegen schaff ich's nicht freundlich zu sein, oh nein
Es heißt ich wär' kein Beziehungstyp, ich hab mein' Spaß
Ich muss raus, ich find' nachts kein' Schlaf
Danke Baby, man verliebt sich nur einmal
Um diesen Stress zu vergessen
Ich würde jeden Preis zahlen
Nur einmal wieder wunschlos glücklich sein
Sag, warum bloß ich, es bleibt
Nur eine tiefe Narbe, Bitch, darauf trink ich
Und, dass du eine weiße Weste hast, stimmt nicht
Obwohl's mir gut geht, muss ich in Sorgen schwimmen
Und glaub mir, ich scheiß' drauf was der nächste Morgen bringt
Vielleicht kommt irgendwann die Wahre Liebe
Guck wie ich den Champagner in mein Glas eingieße

Und dazu noch diesen bally schuh
Genug ich brauch' keine famebitch
Fake chicks mit botox und facelift
Ich brauch ein mädchen mit hoodie und chucks, yes
Die, die anrufe in der nacht schätzt
Die immer für mich da ist
Bei der selbst meine mum sagt sympathisch - die mag ich
Eine frau die mich niemals enttäuscht
Und keine diva die träumt doch ich gib nicht auf

Sie macht sich hübsch für mich
Ein flittchen ist nicht interessant für mich
Sie kommen so schnell an wenn der anzug sitzt
Arrogante chicks die auf high class tun
Fühlen sich mit nem scheiß sekt cool

Kay One,"Ich denk zurück, als ich noch ein Kind war
Weißt du noch, wir zwei im Schwimmbad
Ich hatte Angst, Angst zu ertrinken
Doch du sagtest :""Du musst die Angst überwinden
Vertrau mir ich lieb dich, ich lass dich nicht los
Du schaffst das mein Sohn""
Und du hattest recht, so wie mit allem
Und wärst du nicht da, wär' ich so tief gefallen
Wie oft musstest du wegen mir zu den Lehrern
Wie oft meintest du: „Lern aus den Fehlern
Du tust das für dich, was soll aus dir werden?“
Für mich stand mein Erfolg in den Sternen
Ich wollte rappen, du wolltest Sicherheit
Doch ich hab gesagt, irgendwann bin ich die Eins
Und du hast mich zu den Jams hingefahren
„Mach dir kein Kopf, ich penne hier im Wagen“
Es war ein harter Weg, doch du warst mit dabei
Und hast gehofft, dass ich irgendwann mein Glück erreich'
Und weil du mich jeden Tag unterstützt
Gibt es kein besseren Vater als dich - Olli

Irgendwann, ist das alles vorbei
Dann gibt es nur noch euch zwei
Und der Rest, der mich stehen lässt
Beweist mir, es gibt nichts Besseres
Als deine Eltern
Ja dann ist alles vorbei
Doch ich hab' euch zwei
Und der Rest, der mich stehen lässt
Beweist mir es gibt nichts Besseres
Als meine Eltern

Ich hab dein Lächeln, ich hab deine Augen
Wenn du lachst fliegen zehntausend weiße Tauben
Wenn ich dich seh', geht die Sonne auf
Scheiß auf Rap, ruf mich an und ich komm' nach Haus
Und für dich lass ich alles liegen
Weil meine Brüder und ich dich über alles lieben
Du hattest Angst, dass es mit der Musik nicht klappt
Doch sagtest „Du schaffst das schon, ich lieb' dich Schatz
Ich fahr' dich hin wo du möchtest, sogar nach Alaska“
Weißt du noch, der rote Opel Astra?
Du warst immer da, und dafür dank' ich dir
Du machtest einen Mann aus mir
Es war nicht immer leicht, Mama ich weiß das
Ich bin halt oft unterwegs, und du bleibst wach
Weil du Angst hast, dass mir etwas passiert
Ich pass' auf mich auf, das verspreche ich dir
Und das mit Lay, vertrau mir wir schaffen das
Die einzige Frau, die mich nie verlassen hat
Die einzige Frau, die mich bedingungslos liebt
Und ich danke Gott dass es dich gibt

Irgendwann, ist das alles vorbei
Dann gibt es nur noch euch zwei
Und der Rest, der mich stehen lässt
Beweist mir, es gibt nichts Besseres
Als deine Eltern
Ja dann ist alles vorbei
Doch ich hab' euch zwei
Und der Rest, der mich stehen lässt
Beweist mir es gibt nichts Besseres
Als meine Eltern

Mama, ich dank dir, weil du mir die Kraft gibst
Wenn es mir nicht gut geht und ich wieder wach lieg
Bewunder dein Kampfgeist, 'ne Frau die nie aufgibt
Ich wollt dir nur sagen, dass ich dich auch lieb

Olli, ich dank dir, du hast mir gezeigt wie, wie man ein Mann wird
Und das hier ist dein Lied, bist immer ein Vorbild
Ein Mann, der nie aufgibt
Ich wollte dir nur sagen, dass ich dich auch lieb

Kay One,"Ich erzähl' euch 'ne Geschichte von 'ner ganz coolen Sau
Eines Tages tauchte ich vor so 'ner Tanzschule auf
Ich war betrunken grade auf dem Heimweg von 'ner Disco
Heißhunger und zwar auf zwei Hummer
Da stand ein großer Baum neben so ‘nem großen Haus
Und alles sah so nobel aus
Ich wollte reingehen und fragen ob sie Essen haben
Nur Senioren, die tanzten, schlechte Karten
Nur Omas, die mich anstarrten als wollten sie ein Autogramm haben
Ey Kleiner, das ist ein Tanzabend,
Ü-40, tschüsch, wirklich?
Hier kommt Frischfleisch Madame, ich bin wie'n Pfirsich, ah
Auf einmal kommt so 'ne operierte Dame
Die meint Ihr Mann ist schon seit Wochen auf Montage
Sie sagt mir, dass sie Renate heißt
Und ich denk mir, die ficke ich nur wenn ich 'ne Viagra schmeiß'
Sie fragt wie ich eigentlich heiß'
Ich lenk ab ich weiß Bescheid du bist verzweifelt allein
Das ist egal woher ich komm und egal wie ich heiß'
Wir verbringen diesen Abend zu zweit
Und sie schenkt mir ein Lächeln mit ihren gelben Raucherzähnen
Und ich muss der alten Frau helfen aufzustehen
Und ihre wässrigen Augen fragen
Kannst du mich nach Hause fahren?

Ich weiß nur, dass sie Renate heißt ho-oh
Sie trug das schönste Abendkleid uh-whoa
Sie war schon Anfang fünfzig
Der Apfelkorn war günstig
Sie nahm mich mit nach Haus
Ich kam auf ihrem Bauch

Die Tür geht auf ich sehe nur so einen Fettsack
Mit knallrotem Kopf geschockt, was für ein Pechtag!
„Drecksack, wer bist du? Nagelst meine Frau?“
Ja, dann fahr mich doch nach Haus
„Nein! Ich schlage dich jetzt blau“
Ha, komm versuch's Opa ich hab keine Angst
Auf einmal holt er seine Flinte aus dem Kleiderschrank
Und der Weihnachtsmann rennt auf mich zu
Schlägt mich boxt und ertränkt mich ihm Pool
„Du denkst du bist cool mit deiner roten Cappy""
Naja deine Frau fand mich heute obersexy
„Schnauze du Köter, Kind aus der Gosse“
„Warum schlagen Sie nicht die behinderte Fotze?
Ich wurde von ihr gezwungen, ich war doch noch Jungfrau“
Dumm gelaufen, auf einmal taucht sein Hund auf
Er sagte „Fass, auf Rex fass!
Mal schauen ob du mit meiner Frau Sex hast“
Auf einmal geht die Tür zur Wohnung auf
Ein Italiener mit langem Haar und Rosenstrauß
Und er schreit „Schatz, wer sind diese Männer?“
Und ich antworte „Wir sind die Klemptner wir haben nichts getan
Hier war ein Rohrbruch und außerdem wer bist du?
Mach mal nicht auf George Bush, wir können nix dafür
Wenn sie's nicht mehr bringen“
Ich fall auf die Knie und ich sing'

Ich weiß nur, dass sie Renate heißt ho-oh
Sie trug das schönste Abendkleid uh-whoa
Sie war schon Anfang fünfzig
Der Apfelkorn war günstig
Sie nahm uns mit nach Haus
Und da flog alles auf

Kay One,"Uh, ich seh' dich leiden und du weinst viel
Was ich mein, die Streitereien zum Beispiel
Wie er dich ausnutzt, deine Gutmütigkeit
Und ehrlich, mir tut's für dich Leid
Was du alles für Ihn tust
Die Wünsche von den Lippen liest
Ein Tipp von mir, geh und vergiss den Typ
Er hat dich nicht verdient, du hast es mitgespielt
Ich guck in dein Augen, dein Blick genügt
Ich würd' dir gern diese Entscheidung nehmen
Versuch dir beizustehen
Verdammt ich kann dich nicht mehr weinen sehen
Der Glanz in deinen Augen ist längst nicht mehr da
Ich hoff' dass du dich trennst von dem Arsch
Denk doch mal nach, es wird nicht wie früher
Einmal ein Lügner, für immer ein Lügner, Betrüger
Er wird es nie verstehen
Bei dir fließen Tränen
Es ist zu viel geschehen

Das Spiel, dass er mit dir spielt
Ist falsch weil er nichts mehr fühlt
Ja, du siehst nicht richtig hin
Und vor lauter Liebe bist du blind
Sag, wie oft willst du ihm noch verzeihen?
Verschwende nicht deine kostbare Zeit
Du siehst nicht richtig hin
Und vor lauter Liebe bist du blind (bist du blind)

Du bist blind, bist geblendet, bist verliebt
Dieser Typ hat die Geschenke nicht verdient
Du glaubst mir nicht, kein Ding, frag nach eurem Jahrestag
Und weißt du was die Antwort sein wird „Warte mal“
Du hast ihn deinen Eltern vorgestellt
Jetzt bereust du es, hast du's dir so vorgestellt?
Du warst für ihn da, als es ihm so scheiße ging
Eine Woche später, 'ne andere begleitet ihn
Du hast ihm gleich verziehn', obwohl's geschmerzt hat
Obwohl du wusstest, dass dieser Mann kein Herz hat
Ich hoff' du lernst was daraus
Denn die meisten Typen erkennen
Einfach nicht den Wert einer Frau
Es ist schwer zu vertrauen
Doch du hast es nicht kommen sehen
Merk dir eins, schlechte Menschen kommen und gehen
Er wird es nie verstehen
Bei dir fließen Tränen
Es ist zu viel geschehen

Das Spiel, dass er mit dir spielt
Ist falsch weil er nichts mehr fühlt
Ja, du siehst nicht richtig hin
Und vor lauter Liebe bist du blind
Sag, wie oft willst du ihm noch verzeihen?
Verschwende nicht deine kostbare Zeit
Du siehst nicht richtig hin
Und vor lauter Liebe bist du blind

Und ich frage mich bloß
Warum du noch bleibst
Du glaubst seiner Show, ich seh' doch wie du weinst
Doch es gibt kein Happy-End
Und glaub mir du verdienst einen besseren

Und ich frage mich bloß

Yeah, ihr disst euch alle, doch müsst abdrücken an die Gangster
Deine Rolex, ein Blender, ich merk's an dem Gewicht, Bitch
Ich merk' es an den Farben, dieses scheiß Modell gibt's nicht
Fick dich und fick den alten Kay und auch den ganz Alten
Kleiner, könntest du das Autogramm falten?
Sehr schön und jetzt steck's dir in den Arsch, Diggah
Ich hab ein Einstecktuch, Mutterficker, ich bin ein Adliger
Fick auf deinen Vertrag, ich bin jetzt wieder frei wie Irina Shayk

Ich geb' ab heute einen Fick, wenn die Zeitung mich zerreißt
Mittelfinger ins Gesicht, schreibt mal euern Scheiß

Ausschlafen und Geld zählen, darf ich vorstellen: Mein Leben

Und in mein Leben könnt ihr mir nicht reinreden
Battle gegen mich das kann ich einfädeln
Freestyle bedeutet, es wird Blei regnen
Wenn ich über Fake-Gangster rappe, ich mein' jeden
Sitzen nur im Studio, doch drohen sich im Netz
Posen wie Homos oben ohne, doch ihr Photoshop ist schlecht
Worum es geht? Das übliche: Kohle, Koka oder Crack
Den oberkrassen Benz, die Rolex und verlogenes Geschäft
Ich rappe jeden hier in Grund und Boden, ungelogen
Die Kripo fand in Bushidos Bett Spuren von Hundepfoten
Seid ihr Jungs auf Drogen? Guckt, wie euch der Mut verlässt
Warum ich wieder diss? Haha, ich hab Blut geleckt
Zuviel Cash, zuviel Zeit, Langeweile macht sich breit
Der krasse Hype bringt euch nichts, ihr seid beide angeleint
Und wieder werd' ich angezeigt, danke dir, Habibi
Danke, Herr Ferchichi, hast du mich verstanden? Mein Ya Zippy
Deutschlands P. Diddy, komme nicht klar mit dem Rapgeschäft
Kille meine Feinde mit dem besten Rap
Ab jetzt nennt ihr mich „Eure Exzellenz“
Und eine Frage, die ich an jeden Motherfucker hab
Wenn ich Shindy schlag', bin ich dann ein Arafat?

Hast du mich vermisst, Bitch?
Bin abgedriftet in Champagner, Kokain und Rich Kidz

Hab vergessen, wie man rappt, aber guck mal, wer zurück ist
Man glaubt's kaum, dein Alptraum, ich hab Lust, zu killen
Ich lad' meine Uzi und schieß' auf die Luxusvillen
Aus dem Helikopter, du Opfer, jetzt geht die Post ab
Fotze, du kannst nie so flowen
Die asoziale Version von Dieter Bohlen
Wieder flowe ich so dope und kacke auf Bushidos Thron
Ihr steht in meinem Schatten, Mutterficker, ich bin wie der Mond
Sniff' ein Kilo Koks, ich hass' Moral
Betitel' mich als asozial
Doch deine Freundin gab es mir heut Nacht Oral
Kopf oder Zahl, weil ich die Szene fick'
Und jeder vergeblich unter Tränen schon Migräne kriegt
Ich erledige jeden, Bitch
Und von wegen, dieser Junge ist schon tot, Mann
Fick dich, du Dschungelcamp-Bewohner

Es geht wieder los
Ich spiel' euch hier das Lied vom Tod
Und ich hatte nie viel Niveau
Aber Deutschrap ist wie ein Zoo

Viel Spaß bei meinem Borderline
Junge, hier kommt Borderline
Ich bin wieder back im Game, Bitch drück' play
Ich hab euch gewarnt, mein viertes
Album ist da, ihr seid alle am Arsch
Das hier ist Borderline

Cheerleader-Bitches hier im Sportverein
Film' sie auf der Castingcouch und zieh' mir sofort den Porno rein
Ich fick Rapper tot, kick' besser Flows
Ali sein Hausarzt gab ihm endlich Big-Mac-Verbot
Ich bin unfickbar, und, Diggah, du bist nur noch am rumtwittern
Gib' mir 'nen Grund, du Hund und ich bums' dich in den Mund, Wichser
Ich hab's euch gesagt, komm' back in das Game
Bring' Teufelsparts, für mich sind die Rapper nur Fake
Ich kack' auf all die deutschen Stars

Komm' im Benz und fick die Sondertrends
Hier kommt die Bonzengang
Ihr wollt Beef und lernt bald Micel O's Anaconda kenn'

Anis, pack' mal deine Cordon ein
Du bist der erste Taliban mit Jordans 2
Was für CCN? Nenn' dein Album einfach Doggystyle
Du fühlst dich pudelwohl?
Deine Scheiß Frisur sieht aus wie ein Blumenkohl
Ich fick' dein Vogelnest, ich leg' dir zwei, drei Eier rein
Das ist kein Diss, ich widme dir aus Zeitvertreib nur ein paar Lines
Du weißt bescheid, ich mach' das einfach, um gemein zu sein
Du scheißt auf Eitelkeit
Das sieht man du siehst aus wie einer aus der Kreidezeit
Komm' mir nicht auf einen Nenner, du Penner, du Parkbewohner
Hör' erst auf, wenn du in deinem Sarg vermoderst
Ich bleibe der Star, du Opa, ficke deinen scheiß Skandalpullover
Du bist kein Franzose, deine Promo mit Paris ging in die Hose
Keiner fand es witzig, ich weiß, du fandest es witzig
Mach' mal weiter Promo beleidig' paar Schwule und werd' glücklich
Komm, verpiss dich
Scheiß' dich ein und schick' mir Unterlassungsklagen

Das, was ich mache, das schafft keiner
Hat einer ein' Track mit dem Ruff Rider?
Sie wollen, dass ich über Nacht scheiter, doch ich mach weiter
Und kack' einfach dreimal auf die Neider
Ich meister den Scheiß immer noch auch wenn ich verzweifelt war
dass es nicht leicht war, doch die Geister, die ich rief, kam'
Der Struggle war da, hustlete hart
Bin auf der Achterbahn gefahren und sah die Tiefen und Höhen
Vieles nicht schön, mit so viel falschen Freunden
Gestritten und nie mehr versöhnt, life is a Bitch und ich ficke sie
Wenn ich an der Kippe zieh, denk ich nach
An früher mit meinen beiden Brüdern, die Sonne am Strand
Komm' nicht klar, heute fickt mich das Business
Und falsche Bitches lieben mich wegen Blitzlicht
Fühlen sich wichtig, das gibt's nicht, Bitch, ein Herz aus Stein bleibt
Ficker, nur mit deiner Familie wirst du reich sein
Ich bleib ein Kämpfer, lieber Gott
Ich zeig dir, ich will es, the sky is the limit

Ride till I die, I'm a motherfucking soldier

Die Mädels haben Spaß denn wir chillen auf 'ner Yacht
Und weil ich so viel Geld hab trag ich Sonnenbrillen Nachts
Mutterficker ich bin Kay
Wer von euch hat den selben hype
Wäre ich kein Rapper wär ich lange schon bei Calvin Klein
Du kannst putzen ich stell dich ein
Bring mir den Schampus sonst schlag ich auf den Kellner ein

Diggah ich will mit keinem hier chillen

Hör zu die Presse nervt mich, Hater lutschen
S63 cruist im Dunkeln
Bullen stoppen mich wegen den Felgen
Ihr bekommt ein Selfie, ich kann euch helfen
Schön, Ich bin nur am chillen

Bad mal im Champus, cooles Bild
Und mach nicht auf Playboy du bist Müll

Und verpiss dich Miststück, nix mit Rich Kid
Meine Clique fickt deine Chicks, stript für mich auf dem Rücksitz
Hurensohn Paparazzi

Ich bin sick unterwegs, frag Ibuprofen

Und der Snack an der Tanke macht dich nicht satt
Ich vermiss' meine Fam und das Essen
Fick jedes scheiß Restaurant, Mama kocht echt am besten
Vor dem Hotel steht ein Shuttle
Ich hoff nur, dass ich meinen Flug heute schaffe
Termin in Berlin und dann direkt nach Wien
Wieder vor Tausenden spielen, mein Handy am klingeln
Meine Anwälte stressen, schon wieder nervt mich die Presse
Wieder Probleme, die Medien ficken meinen Schädel
Ich hoff, dass die Jungs alles regeln, es ist am Regnen
Und wir fahren schon echt lange
Um mich abzulenken schreib ich Autogramme
Les ein paar Briefe von meinen Fans
Wie oft hat mir das schon ein Lächeln geschenkt

Es geht vom Montag bis hin zum Freitag
Es geht vom Januar bis zum Dezember
Vom Urlaub keine Spur, ich bin bloß auf Tour
Blicke durch mein Hotelfenster
Und wenn ich nachts nach der Show dann einschlaf'
Merk ich mein Leben hat sich verändert
Von Freizeit keine Spur, sie tickt, die scheiß Uhr
Ich blick' aus meinem Hotelfenster

Ich steig' aus dem Bus, werd' sofort erkannt
Teens kommen angerannt mein Bekanntheitsgrad
In Deutschland ist echt krass
Ich hätt's niemals gedacht
Dass sich all meine Massenhysterie entfacht
Schuhklassen, an jedem Flughafen
Jugendliche die auf ihren Zug warten machen Selfies
Und stellen die Fotos online
Kids ziehen sich die Songs rein
Ich mach das hier gern, und ich will ihnen zeigen
Egal wer du bist du kannst alles erreichen
Du musst nur drauf scheißen
Wenn Neider meinen du wirst es niemals reißen
Klar dieser Job macht mich müde
Und sehr oft ist es hart
Doch es ist das was ich wollte
Der Junge ohne Abschluss ist heute ein Star

Bekleidet mit den Marken, die du nicht mal aussprechen kannst
Allein im ganzen Laden denn sie schließen für mich ab, Biatch
Du fährst in 'nem kack Fiat
Dein Gehalt sind für den AP Millionaires Club Peanuts
Ich zähl' das Lila ich zähl' das Grüne, ich zähl' das Gelbe
Gib besoffen Interviews und ihr versteht nur noch die Hälfte
Ihre Latina Haut wie zartbitter
Gib mir das Whisky glas Dicka
Hol den Grasticker, danach fick' ich paar Mütter

Junge ich bin auf der Spitze dieser Welt geboren
Ich fahr' allein auf dieser Piste
Und bin wieder top in Form ich hab auf Gott geschworen
Dass ich mich räch', ich bin nicht back, denn ich war niemals weg
Mache deine Fresse auf ich piss sechs Liter Sekt
Der Wichser fickt jetzt rap komplett
Mir egal wer du bist ich hole mein Geld und bezahle die Bitch
Ich bunker' die Kohle doch sag es dir nicht

Fuck, what happened last night?
Fuck what happened last night

Bitte sag mir was ist nur passiert
Wie kam ich von der Disco zu mir?
Warum ist von dem Cash alles weg?
Wiedermal im Suff 10 SMS an die Ex!
Kopffick, keiner Stopt mich!
Sechs Liter Wodka, das bockt und es lockt, aber Knockt dich aus
Dikka was fürn Rausch?
Und der Türsteher gab mir so krass auf's Maul!
Was ich brauch?! Aspirin!
Ein Verbandskasten, mann Ich hass Jim Beam
Hass Grey Goose, man Ich hass' Tequila
Und schwör jedes mal „Ja Ich mach's nicht wieder!“
Wodka Kirsches auf meinem Shirt
Jacky Coke auf den Schuhen
Die Polizei wieder vor dem Hotel
Ich Verpiss mich hier Schnell
Tja ich werd schon wieder gesucht
Mit den Bitches im Pool!
Ich dacht, ich bin einfach der Boss
Und vor dem Sex, hab ich Depp einfach drei-mal gekotzt!
Und bin dann betrunken ins Taxi gestiegen
Erzählte dem Fahrer dann was über Kriesen!
Über Liebe, über das Leben
Ich mein da Vorne hat sich der Typ übergeben
Ja man, ich konnt' nicht mehr Stehen und Gehen
Und wollt so 'ne Grotte von Mädel mitnehmen
Alk ist der Teufel
Ich erinner' mich an kaum was
Hab ihre Titten angefasst und dann gesagt Baby Chill
Bevor dem Rap-Ding war ich Hausarzt!
Sauf' was, mit mir
Im Kühlschrank ist Bier!

Wo ist mein Auto? Ich seh' bloß ein Taxi!
In mei'm Vorgarten, ich benehm' mich so assi!
Blau schlag ich auch Paparazis
Und sag zu dem Bullen kauf meine Maxi!
Versuch vom Dach in den Pool zu springen
Mama weiß, ich war nie ein gutes Kind!
Denn der Badboy schmiss seine Schule hin
Zu viel Gin das sind meine Jugendsün-
-Den zurück zur Story!
In meinem Flur steht ein verficktes Pony!
Man wie krass, man mein versnoppter Nachbar
Liegt in der Badewanne wie ein Bastard!
Zahnarzt ich mach schnell ein Selfie
Beweisfoto muss sein!
Ich habe meine Kohle leider wiedermal verballert
Bis zum Monatsende keinen großen Schein!
Mein Gehirn wie Brei!
Wodka, Energy raub den Schlaf!
Ich wach auf und blick auf 'nen Arsch
Doch als ich dann ihr Gesicht sah
Erinnerte mich ihre Fresse an eine Pizza!
Und sie sagt „Guten Morgen“
Ich sag, Bitch Gute Nacht!
Wie konnt ich das tun ja mir kommen schon die Tränen vom Lachen
Und sie meint nur fick dich du Spast!
Und ich zünd' mir 'ne Kippe an und dann
Denk ich wo ist eigentlich Uhr und die Klunker?
Ich lauf' runter noch Blau, und es geht schlecht
Schlüssel und das scheiß Portmonee weg!
Jeden Sonntag nehm' ich mir vor, nie wieder zu trinken

Kay One,"Ich hab gedacht, dass es leicht wär
Es wird mir klar, ich muss eins lern'
Schmerz geht, doch die Narben sind für immer
Die Hoffnung scheint unauffindbar
War ich zu jung oder nur zu dumm?
Das mit dir hatte Zukunft
Schatz, ich wollte was festes
Es war'n deine Worte, entweder so oder man lässt es
Ich gab dir mein Wort, hab noch geschwor'n
War noch im Studio, machte 'nen Song
Jeden Tag draußen, Kino, spazier'n
All diese Bilder, sie sind noch hier
Verdammt, ich vermiss dich
Komm zurück, ich werd' anders nicht glücklich
Und ja, ich versteh, was du meinst
All meine Fehler, ich seh sie jetzt ein, dass ich
Nicht da war, das tut mir so Leid
Du hast noch versucht, nicht zu wein'
Auch wenn du jetzt glücklich bist
Bitte vergiss mich nicht, Gott beschütze dich

Zusammen mit dir aufsteh'n, ich sehn' mich so sehr
Die Zeit will nicht vergeh'n, jetzt erkenn' ich dein Wert
Und manchmal tut es weh, wenn man etwas verliert
Die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt, deshalb blick ich zur Tür

Doch es gibt kein Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n
Denn es ist so viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n
Allein geh ich jetzt diesen Weg, diesen Weg, diesen Weg
Hast du nicht gesagt „Ich begleit dich ins Grab?“

Wenn ich aufsteh und am Frühstücken bin
Schatz, glaub mir, ich fühl mich so schlimm
Kein Chill'n, kein Kuscheln, kein Sex
Ich sitz nur zuhause und schreib Tracks
Doch jeder Track ist über dich
Ich will, dass es wieder wie früher ist
Weißt du noch, unser erster Kuss
Unser erstes Date, brachte dich zum Bus
Alles war zu schön, doch was ist jetzt?
Das passiert, wenn man jemanden nicht schätzt
Ja, du bist weg, aber wohin?
Sag, warum war ich so blind?
Nein, Geld macht nicht glücklich
Was bringt ein 5-Sterne-Koch, wenn du nichts isst?
Was bringt dir Urlaub allein, Champagner und Wein?
Nein, es bringt dir nichts, wenn du kein' hast zum Teil'n
Jetzt bist du frei, also genieß diese Zeit
Baby, nie wieder Streit und ich will, dass du weißt
Dass ich immer da bin
Bitte pass auf sie auf, amen

Zusammen mit dir aufsteh'n, ich sehn' mich so sehr
Die Zeit will nicht vergeh'n, jetzt erkenn' ich dein Wert
Und manchmal tut es weh, wenn man etwas verliert
Die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt, deshalb blick ich zur Tür

Doch es gibt kein Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n
Denn es ist so viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n
Allein geh ich jetzt diesen Weg, diesen Weg, diesen Weg
Hast du nicht gesagt „Ich begleit dich ins Grab?“

Wenn wir zwei allein
Jetzt uns're Wege geh'n
Ich hoff, du weißt
Egal, was auch passiert
Ich bin für dich da
Ich hoff, es gibt ein Wiederseh'n

Doch es gibt kein Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n

Du bist nicht mehr diese Frau die mich geliebt hat, nein, Schatz
In deiner Welt gibt es für einen wie mich kein' Platz
Sag wie lang hab ich um dich gekämpft
Nichts mehr gegessen und nicht gepennt
Wie lange hab ich auf mein Handy gestarrt
Obwohl ich wusste, du bist längst nicht mehr da
Hab mir eingeredet, dass die Hoffnung zuletzt stirbt
Und gesehen, dass in den Medien gehetzt wird
Heute weiß ich, sie wollten uns trenn', denn
Leider ist nicht alles Gold, was hier glänzt
Wir waren zu jung, für den Schritt nicht bereit
Vielleicht war es auch nicht die richtige Zeit
Eifersucht und Streit durch den Druck
Sekunde, ich gönne mir noch kurz 'nen Schluck
Denk jeden Tag an dich, wenn ich aufsteh, raus geh
Wie viele Songs muss ich noch aufnehm'n?
Kein', denn das war mein Letzter
Was mach's gut? Ok, mach's besser
Doch denk dran, ich wünsch dir das Beste

Schlaflose Nächte, eiskaltes Herz
Und jede Scheiß-Party war's einfach nicht wert
So oft war ich von den Weibern genervt
Blick in mein Inneres, ich zeig dir den Herbst
Ich leide nicht mehr, wenn ich uns're Bilder seh
Wie oft hast du mir gesagt, du willst nicht geh'n?
Wie oft hast du mir gesagt, bleib für immer?
Ein Foto von dir? Ich hab gar keins im Zimmer
Baby, ich hab abgeschlossen
Wie viele Jahre war ich nachts besoffen?
Wie viele Male hab ich mich geschlagen?
Ich schwör, ich konnt diesen Kopfschmerz nicht ertragen
Meine Wut raus gelassen, hab mich nicht im Griff
Doch scheiß drauf, egal, es ist, wie es ist
Bleib wie du bist, du gehst dein' Weg
Das sind Geschichten, die das Leben erzählt
Ich wünsch dir das Beste, ein Haus mit 'nem Garten
Ein' Mann, der dich liebt, mit 'nem fetten Sportwagen
Zwei Mädchen und zwei Jungs, wie du's wolltest
Auf dass sie gut in der Schule sind und du stolz bist
Viel Geld, doch am meisten Gesundheit
Dass du noch die nächsten 50 Jahre jung bleibst
Und dass Gott dich beschützt
Vergiss mich nicht

Irgendwann sehen wir uns wieder
Irgendwann bin ich bereit
Irgendwann merk ich dass du, all die Lieder für mich schreibst
Irgendwann bin ich allein und dann fällt´s mir wieder ein
All die Jahre war ich dein
Irgendwann sehen wir uns wieder
Und wir beide schau'n zurück
Gott wird helfen, doch wir zwei
Wir verschenkten unser Glück
Irgendwann bin ich allein und dann fällt´s mir wieder ein
All die Jahre war ich dein",Irgendwann [Instrumental],2016
Kay One,"I´m trying hard to understand
How the world keeps spinning around while you´re not here with me
Didn´t had the chance to make it there
Couldn´t even say good bye, thought it last forever
Keep on praying, keep keep on praying, say we keep on praying for now
Say we keep on praying, keep keep on praying, say we keep on praying for now
And we will see each other again
One day we´re gonna understand it´s plans
Remember all the good times that we had and I promise, I´ll never forget you

Ich blick in den Himmel und rede mit dir
Ich würd‘ es dir geben das Leben von mir
Ich kann‘s nicht verstehen und ich möcht es auch nicht
Dreh dich nicht um, lauf direkt in das Licht
Wir alle waren da, an deinem schneeweißen Sarg
Und trugen dich wirklich zu zehnt an dein Grab
Jeder war da, glaub mir jeder war da
So viele Fotos von dir und die Tränen sie kamen
Ich zählte nicht nach, so viele Kerzen am brennen
Du warst so ein herzlicher Mensch
Egal wo du warst, du hast Freude bereitet
Wolltest dich nie mit den Freunden drum streiten
Ich schreib hier die Zeilen, mit meinem Blut
Wer will mich trösten, nichts mehr ist gut
Nichts mehr wird so sein, wie es einmal war
Bitte bleib doch da

And we will see each other again
One day we´re gonna understand it´s plans
Remember all the good times that we had and I promise, I´ll never forget you

And we will see each other again
One day we´re gonna understand it´s plans
Remember all the good times that we had and I promise, I´ll never forget you

Ich sitz am PC und seh diese Videos von uns
Und all unsere Songs hab‘ ich nie mehr gepumpt
Es zieht mich so runter es bringt mich nur um
Ich würd‘ gern weiterleben, doch find keinen Grund
Mir läuft´s eiskalt gerade den Rücken hinunter
Bald mach ich mir dein Tattoo auf die Schulter
Mit deinem Todestag
Man ich bete millionen Mal für dich, ich sterbe grad ohne Spaß
Wie oft hab‘ ich Gott gefragt und gehofft, dass er antwortet
Schmeiß mir ein Seil in das Loch, ich will raus
Alles erinnert an dich
Denk ich an gute Zeiten, verschlimmert es sich
Es tut weh, ich war für den Scheiß nicht bereit
Ich fahr durch die Nacht, verkneif mir das weinen
Vorbei ist die Zeit, als wir das Leben noch liebten
Ruhe in Frieden

And we will see each other again
One day we´re gonna understand it´s plans
Remember all the good times that we had and I promise, I´ll never forget you

Why you have to go and leave me on my own
In my heart I know, the angels ?

And we will see each other again
One day we´re gonna understand it´s plans
Remember all the good times that we had and I promise, I´ll never forget you

No I never forget you
No I never forget you",One Day [Instrumental],2016

Mein Styling-Ratschlag geh zu Extrem Schön
Ich ficke Bitches, von denen du träumst
Und du steigst grad in den Telebus, Boy
Check, Führerschein und dann gleich Lamborghini
Ich schmeiß mit den Scheinen wie Breezy, fang, du Wichser
Ich kann's, du Pisser, Landbesitzer
Allein mein Garten erinnert dich an Ibiza
Schneller, lauter, Harley
Wenn er Roli sagt, sag ich ab heute Rarri

Während du Penner in 'nem Zug einpennst
Lern ich Grundlagen für den Flugschein kennen
Ich wollte schon immer diesen Flugschein, denn
Ich hab gehört, 'ne Stewardess kann mich gut reiten
Aha aha, plus ich mach, was ich will
Tätowiert unter'm Anzug, das passt nicht ins Bild
Doch trotzdem fick ich die Geschäftsführerin
(Bis wann?) Bis ich Geschäftsführer bin
Du willst mir hier erzählen, wie ich mein Geld vervielfach?
Bevor wir weiter reden, du verdienst was?
Klappe, ich bin hier, um zu feiern
Links eine Bitch, rechts eine Bitch, Dreier
Weiter feiern, geiern, trinken
Ich ficke die Bitches heute in 'nem Maybach hinten

Der heute Nacht dein Talent sucht wie Bruce Darnell Bitch

Denkst du, es war so schön in 'nem Plattenbau?

Nice wie Kendall oder Kylie
Du kannst alles tragen, Baby, Sneakers oder High-Heels
Urlaub, Sightseeing, du darfst bei mir einziehen
Guck, wie sie bereitliegt, deine Philipp-Plein-Jeans, ah
Lieb' deine Art, du bist alles wert
Ich mag dich, weil du mich nicht wie 'n Superstar verehrst
Aber ich bin der, der dich wie einen Superstar verehrt
Deshalb cruisen wir im Lamborghini Huracán ans Meer
Rapper wollen über Geld reden, Schatz

Was, Golf oder Schach? Baby, ich steh' mehr auf Action
Liebe deinen Booty, denn du shakst gerne mit dem Arsch wie 'ne Kardashian
Lieb' deine braunen Augen, lieb' deine braune Haut
Ganz egal, wo du bist, Leute hören nicht auf zu staunen
Hatte echt gedacht, ich könnte nie wieder 'ner Frau vertrauen
Denn die meisten sehen nur mein Geld und sie laufen aus
Hunderttausend Likes auf deinen Fotos
So sexy, deine Haut riecht nach Kokos
Und wenn ich dich seh', bin ich im Aufreißermodus

Ich dachte mir: „Dem geb' ich gern mal 'ne Faust!“
Er lag direkt flach, bei der nächsten Station
Sind wir zwei rausgerannt wie auf Leben und Tod

Herzlich willkommen, jetzt verpiss dich aus Kitzbühel
Du fuckst dich ab, weil der DJ mein'n Hit spielt
Du chillst mit 'ner Horde am Bahnhof
Wir geben Geld aus, Port Adriano
Wir geben Geld aus, Hotel Ushuaïa
Doch all diese Drugs gehen schnell auf die Eier
Weiter, im Huracán immer weiter
Du Bastard, ohne Dach nennt man ihn Spyder
Weiber in meinem Daimler
Zuhause alles Gold, ich bin ein Kaiser
Fick dich, weil du nichts schaffst
Und ich lach' mich grade schlapp, Digga, ich mach'
Was du in 'nem Monat machst in 'nem scheiß Tag
Jeden Tag feiern, jeden Tag Freitag
Ich rolle im weißen Benz
Und zeige den Motherfuckern, dass dich hier keiner kennt
Verballer' mein Geld täglich mit meiner Gang
Nicht mal für 'ne Mio mach' ich mit bei Let's Dance
Baby, füll mal das Glas auf
Pass den Moloko, ich wart' drauf
Wir sind im Club, es gibt Action
Check meinen Style, more money, more fashion

Ich cruis' von Kitzbühel nach Monaco, 300 auf dem Tacho
Im Cabrio mit Sakko, die Bullen verfolgen mich wie El Chapo
Chapo, Chapo, King wie El Chapo, Chapo
Sie stehen auf Machos
Fahr' zum Shoppen nach Milano und du wachst auf am Bahnhof

Es tut mir leid, dass es neben dir noch Frauen gab

Baby, dass du fortgegangen bist, ich schwör', ich kann's verstehen
Welche Frau toleriert 'ne andre neben sich?
Treue ist das wichtigste, doch ich kannt' es eben nicht
Meine Freunde waren mir wichtiger, die Partys waren mir wichtiger
Ja, alles war mir wichtiger und jetzt trifft mich das Schicksal hart
Während du zuhause warst, war ich in den geilsten Clubs
Und weil ich so ein Arschloch war, entstand bei mir die Eifersucht
Es waren meine eigenen Geister, die mich jetzt selber jagten
Und ich dacht', du machst das Gleiche, ja, ich weiß, kompletter Wahnsinn
Dein iPhone ohne Passwort, mein iPhone umgedreht
Damit man keine Nachricht sieht, wie oft war ich unterwegs?
Man schätzt viele Dinge erst, wenn sie nicht mehr da sind
Egal, wie viel ich auch besitz', ich merk', dass ich grad arm bin

All das hier bereu' ich so sehr, ich würd's gern rückgängig machen
Ich betrink' mich, du hast recht, das ist nicht sehr erwachsen
Ich bleib' Peter Pan, wozu verändern? Ab jetzt bin ich eh allein
Die Sonne ist verschwunden, ja, und ohne Licht, da geh' ich ein
Ich denk' an die Tage, als wir glücklich waren, weißt du noch?
Egal, wie viel Frauen kommen, du gehst nicht aus meinem Kopf
Der Gedanke dran, wie dich dein neuer Freund umarmt
Ist meine Rechnung für das Ganze, ich muss heut bezahlen
Allein schon diese Vorstellung, wie er dich küsst und an sich ranzieht
Ist wie Messerstiche in mein Herz, doch ich weiß, ich kann ihm nichts tun
Er ist zu dir besser als ich jemals war
Und jeden Tag bekommst du von ihm das, was ich dir eh nicht gab
Es tut mir so leid, Baby, du bist jetzt frei
Von Herzen alles Gute euch zweien

Ich schau' keine scheiß Komödien mehr, dein Lachen fehlt so sehr
Öffne WhatsApp und hör' die letzten Sprachnotizen an
Ich geh' auf Insta, seh' deinen neuen Freund und denk' mir nur verdammt
Ich nehm' die ganze Schuld auf mich, die ganze Schuld auf mich
Schließ' meine Augen, stell' mir vor, wie du mich in dem Kino küsst

Ouhh-wouh
Ho-oh

Es kommt mir vor wie gestern, als wir zwei so jung und dumm und voller Fehler waran
Wir haben die Zeit zusammen verbracht, ich weiß es noch, jeden Tag
Ich konnte dir vertrauen, so wie du mir, wir war'n unzertrennlich
Und allein die Augen zeigten mir, dass du ein guter Mensch bist
Du kanntest meine Macken, kanntest meine Ängste
Die Geheimnisse, die Ziele, wusstest, wofür ich kämpfe
„Du kannst alles schaffen!“, waren deine Worte, sie haben mir Mut gemacht
Wie oft hast du mir gesagt: „Ich glaub' daran, dass du es packst“?
Wie oft warst du für mich da und hast mich getröstet?
Und selbst nach einem Streit war ich dir nicht lange böse
Denn ich wusste, du trägst dein Herz am rechten Fleck
Mit 'nem Abschied, um zu gehen, ich lerne es grad jetzt
Meine Trauer zu verdräng'n mit den Momenten, als wir Spaß hatten
Ich wollt' dir alles nachmachen
Ich wollte sein wie du und du wolltest sein wie ich
Weißt du, wie sehr ich diese Zeit vermiss'?

Denn als du von mir gingst
Ist ein Teil in dir gestorben
Hilflos wie ein Kind
Allein mit all den Sorgen
Ich wünsche mir echt nichts
Als dich wieder zu sehen
Ja, wir beide hätten uns viel zu erzählen
Mein Herz aus Gold

Jahre gehen vorbei, doch die Erinnerung kann keiner nehmen
Warum nur du? Es wär' nur fair gewesen, wenn wir beide gehen
Die Zeit bleibt stehen, während die Welt sich weiterdreht
Ist in meinem Kopf ein Fotoalbum, das mich weiter quält
Die Frage: „Was wäre wenn?“ beschäftigt mich
Vergesse nichts, heute ist ein leerer Platz am Essenstisch
Egal, was für ein Mensch noch kommt, keiner kann die Lücke füllen
Und weißt du was? Ich hab's wieder geklebt, das zerrissene Bild
Es hängt am Kühlschrank neben unsren Kinderfotos
Wie oft höre ich dein Lachen heut noch in der Wohnung?
Wie oft schau' ich mir alte Urlaubsvideos an?
Doch nie wieder könnt' ich in denselben Urlaub, dort zum Strand
Denn etwas würde fehlen, etwas Unersetzbares
Ich schreib' kein'n Brief, sondern mein Lied, und hoff', dass du die Message kriegst
Und jedes Jahr, wenn der Schnee runterfällt
Merk' ich, das Leben vergeht viel zu schnell

Denn als du von mir gingst
Ist ein Teil in dir gestorben
Hilflos wie ein Kind
Allein mit all den Sorgen
Ich wünsche mir echt nichts
Als dich wieder zu sehen

If we ain't who you tryin' to hear
Somethin' either wrong with your eyes and ears
I came in this game screamin' Jers'
Ain't an MC in our lane to try and merge
Try and run with our wave
But I'm cool with bein' Eddie Levert seein' my son on stage
Gun gon' blaze, act up in this joint
And I'ma be Nate Robinson and back up the point
Your run's over, run with us or get run over
I'm here to save this shit, and I brung soldiers

This is lyrical murder
Me and every track have a physical merger
When I stab it in the chest I'ma bit of a curver
So it bleeds to death, like the middle of a unfinished burger
Or sometimes I wrap my hand around his throat
Cause he think his kick is slick or his little snare is dope
Shoot the bass in the face but sometimes I carry a rope
To hang the piano keys when they hittin' every note
I'm what no beat's able to withstand
If you suffer from writer's block and your label got big plans
Listen to this fam
Slide a little dough out that budget, and hire the instrumental hitman

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She'd be unhappy without me I know

Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;

Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

Remember what goes up must come down
And, Baby, you've been flying too high

You ought to get your walkin' papers
But now it's too late
Because I know you too well
When you're through cuttin' capers
You break down my gate
To ring my front door bell

So go have your fling, and don't miss a thing
I'll see you down to earth by and by
Remember what goes up must come down
And, Baby, you've been flying too high",Flyin' Too High (What Goes up Must Come Down),1997
Kay Starr,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You,1997
Kay Starr,"I'm confessin' that I love you,
Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""
If you go, you know you'll grieve me,
All in life on you depends.
Am I guessin' that you love me,
Dreaming dreams of you in vain,
I'm confessin' that I love you, over again.",I'm Confessin' (That I Love You),1997
Kay Starr,"Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine
Into each heart some tears must fall
But some day the sun will shine

Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine

Into each and every life some rain has got to fall
But too much of that stuff is fallin' into mine
And into each heart some tears gotta fall
And I know that someday that sun is bound to shine

Some folks can lose the blues in their heart
But when I think of you another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is fallin' in mine",Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall,1997
Kay Starr,"You may spell love with capital ""L"" 
But I spell love with a capital ""You"" 
Through the day you're away 
And I'm mopin, mopin mope 
And you do too, I hope, I hope, I hope 
All life through, love with a capital ""You"" 
Would just suit me to a capital ""T"" 
I can spell just as well as the dictionaries do, 
But I spell love with a capital ""You""!","Love With a Capital ""You""",1997
Kay Starr,"I hate to see that evening sun go down, 
I hate to see that evening sun go down, 
'Cause my lovin' baby done left this town. 

If I feel tomorrow, like I feel today, 
If I feel tomorrow, like I feel today, 
I'm gonna pack my trunk and make my getaway. 

Oh, that St. Louis woman, with her diamond rings, 
She pulls my man around by her apron strings. 
And if it wasn't for powder and her store-bought hair, 
Oh, that man of mine wouldn't go nowhere. 

I got those St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be, 
Oh, my man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea, 
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me. 

I love my man like a schoolboy loves his pie, 
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his rocker and rye 
I'll love my man until the day I die, Lord, Lord. 

I got the St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be, Lord, Lord! 
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea, 
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me. 

I got those St. Louis blues, I got the blues, I got the blues, I got the blues, 
My man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea, 
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me, Lord, Lord!",St. Louis Blues,1997
Kay Starr,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1997
Kay Starr,"Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time 

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all of the time 

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
The lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more 

Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all of the time 

I walk around,
Heavy-hearted and sad
Night comes around
And I'm still feeling bad
Rain pourin' down
Blinding every hope I had
This pitter 'n patter 'n beatin' 'n spatterin' drivin' me mad 

Love, love, love, love
This misery will be the end of me 

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
The lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more 

Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time, the time
Keeps raining all the time",Stormy Weather,1997
Kay Starr,"It seems we stood and talked like this before.
We looked at each other in the same way then,
But I can't remember where or when.

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore.
The smile you were smiling you were smiling then,
But I can't remember where or when.

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again.

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before and loved before,
But who knows where or when?",Where or When,1997
