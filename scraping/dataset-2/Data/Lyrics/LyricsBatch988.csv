Hey Girl!
That's what I said when I seen her
Hey Girl!
Wanna do more than just meet ya
Hey Girl!
Tell me whats your story
Cause later on tonight you could be my shorty
Hey Girl!
If you gotta man you can keep him
Hey Girl!
Cause baby I'm worth the cheating
Hey Girl!
With them pretty brown eyes
Slim waist, thick thighs
Tell me if ya down tonight

[Chorus]
You and me and tonight
Girl what do ya say?
I gotta have it
U's a sexy thing
The way you pop it, shake it, breaking it down for me
You know you bout to be my jumpoff [Repeat: x2]

Verse 2:
Hey Girl!
Gotta spot down town to go to
Hey Girl!
Baby tell me what you goin' do
Hey Girl!
Cause the liquors talking
Plus I know your ready by the way you take it off and oh
Hey Girl!
I'm just stuck on your features
Hey Girl!
And I'm trying beat it up til ya speechless
Hey Girl!
With them pretty brown eyes
All you gotta do is tell me that you goin' be down tonight

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Sean Paul]
Strip club shorty
Big boy bought it
Had to holla at her
Sound like she would fuck the wall in
So I said whats happening
Shorty what the business
Picture you and me riding 4-wheel spinning
5-star living
1st class flying
Ill change your lifestyle
Shorty I ain't lying
Put you in some Gucci heels
And let you walk around
Smoke a Latin blunt with ya
Then its going down
Watch me do my thing
You fucking with Sean Paul
We can hit the bed
And throw her up against the wall
Yeah you the shit
Ya matching panties with ya bra
Yeah you looking good
But shorty goin' take it off
Shorty what it called
Its nothing to a boss
If only for one night
Like Luther Vandross
I'ma keep it trill
And you just do the same
And you just holla at me
When you here em call my name

Bankhead Westside nigga A Town
Adamville, Alley Temple
Nigga A Town, aye and I said

I jumped off the post Center Hill I was seven then
Moved to College Park at eleven started sellin' wit
It started sinkin' in, they really gave my uncle ten
Now what I'm 'posed to do? Get a crew and start hustlin'

Now we trappin' up on Campbellton, ask 'em, they remember me
We used to move that work from Oak City way to Kimberly
Took the hustle out that Riverdale, made a killin' G
Brought it back to Bankhead, where I'm gon' see it till it's history

On the Westside trillin' up, Zone 3 fillin' up
Herndon Homes, Bowen Homes, Harvel Homes, fillin' up
Ain't nobody trill as us, Bankhead really fucked
That's why my Dayton rims make yo' rims look like titty fuck

Listen up, only nigga in the South they talkin' 'bout
Put your bitch out on the expressway make her walk it out

Spread all the way too Tennessee

From Glenwood to County Road niggas gettin' paid
From Weslyn Chapel back to Covington Highway

Ya can't do a song about the A without me
See I was gettin' money while they was in car seats
See I was in the street, shawty totin' that heat
Throw the E's in they face and let 'em know I'm 'bout heat

ATL, Dirty South, I played in the grit
This was 'round the time when niggas first saw bricks
Back when Ronald Reagan was the president and shit

Drama had a house right off of Hollywood Road
(Westside)
They was robbin' and tastin' Hollywood coke
Mama say we movin'
When she get a lil' mo' paper she enrolled me into school
But it will weigh out in Decatur

This was 'round the time when Elay Meadows was the ghetto
And I was sleepin' with the rats and roach gloss on my pillow
When niggas rolled hammers down Calabenki
Put that Ghetto Mafia back in I'ma fizz off

Back when niggas didn't know shit about a cigarillo

Never been a nigga that you know like dis
Cold like dis, but ah, it's just me and D-Mo like dis
Respect is a must, got every nigga in every hood checking for us
Never catch us catching the bus
Niggas got whips, niggas got loot,
niggas got troops, got guns, got clips (what)
Next big thing, iced watch to go with the necklace ring
Iced out to go with the rest it seems
More or less the more of the best you seen
Big buzz, only rolling with big thugs
We get in clubs you know you getting ya shit bust
Not too many ducks is going against us
If ya don't know now, you'll know when ya lift up

Till I'm 5'9"" no more, till the ice can't shine no more

Never disrespect a nigga gripping the tec, it's my shit
Put the flow in affect with my clique
Go to the death, flow the best, my spit, I'm sick, it's my shit
Try to get slick and niggas is getting hit
You don't want that do you? It comes back to you
And I ain't even trying to rap to you, so suck my dick, it's my shit
Too many willing to pin ya in rap
put a ending to that, do the math with me
Straight to the lab, we're sending you back
Keep going, you know that no one can last wit me
Stay armed with the biggest of arms, got bitch-niggas hitting alarms
Every rhyme is strictly writing to harm
This my shit, keep every word of every verse in position to launch

That why you running to a real rider like Twista, or Roysta
Let the thirty caliber anoint ya
Whodie won't even know he hit till he feel his shirt suckin the moisture
Voice ya opinion if ya want to
Kick-ass winner, kick up dust in the middle of the arena
Subpoena motherfuckers like the courts do
We'll blast shortly ya nuts bust and it won't be a misdemeanor
We them niggas that'll come approach ya
Shocking ya body our Bacardi keeps all ya nerves from bleeding
Until we heard no breathing, two undercovers,
we coming we get the dirty even, they know it's serving season
Shit is good as gone, cause I gotta bring the goodies home
The petty packing penny brushing with the pretty pearl handle
Pistol, Pelle Pelle pants and the hoodie on
And you coming with the Midwest shit?
Remember how we took you, you tripping off how we did that shit
Somebody tell me where the weed at
Some niggas knew I was about to snap so he hid that shit
I was gon' get buck, come hard, get crunk
Go into a thing and let the rhyme ride,
and hit them niggas from the blindside
And take the whole opposition down with my dog 5'9
Ceremony for the killers, busting 'em off,
and coming off so you can bust yo' nut
Though I'm bout to bust yo' guts

But I'm still here so before I'm gone gimme the love
Imma take my flowers now when I can still smell 'em
Then roll up the strongest trees and inhale em
The world is getting worse everyday I try to tell em
As long as you keep buying the lies then they gon' sell 'em
Y'all niggas is mad and they tired, ready to act out
You can't keep killing them and not expect them to black out
You locked the front doors on 'em and they take the backround
All your shit will leave your face with the shit smacked out

I’m fraying but I’m saying that I’m spraying cause I am if I have to
Salute the niggas laying on the land like a statue
If I say I’m staying where I stand I'ma vanish
If I say I'm out, I'm playing with the menace
That's like beef or vendetta
You wouldn't understand the goals without a mask on your face
Shoulda really feel somthing, when they blast in your face
If you playing in the jungle feel the wrath of those apes
But I'm positive and negative, ignorant and conscience too
Listen to the angels, but watch what the monsters do
You addicted niggas sponsor you
Tell you have another one, watch that shit conquer you
Even the wise do foolish shit
Even the cop kill a kid that go to school and shit
Believe it or not, stand still and you can move with it
Open your eyes and I ain't even got to prove this shit

Oh my god
How I humble myself
As I bow to your throne
I pray for love, peace and happiness
To be present in my home
Yes, I do
And let your heart",Top Tier,2015

Tonight I stayed home by the phone
Talking to the person's unknown
Take me to another zone
This is my life on the phone

Well I feel like Donald Duck
Sold my eyes for an once of luck
And now my backs on fire, my burning wire
The people upstairs don't scream so high

So I decided to fly off again and flew up really high
Away up on the crest out of sight
As I was taking off I was for the first time aware
That the people might see me taking off and land and fool around generally

I felt real numb ? everyone so I sat quite sad and sombre
I felt real numb ? everyone so I sat quite sad and sombre

Flying away from the site on the motorway
Quite high so we decided to head back
From the ticket office on the edge of the site
Said they couldn't make it for myself so we ain't gonna fly

In previous dreams I felt ?
But sometimes ? restrictions on my arms
And flap a little hands in the case of the dream
Didn't work so a superman dream
I couldn't do it in the superman style
So I tried flying off to Glasgow
Where I was flying somewhere in style on the M8
And I got caught more and more so I came lower and lower
So I don't think I wanna do couldn't fly anymore
Landed on the car where a women saw me
Suddenly appeared on the car but she couldn't carry anything
She walked down the street but she ?
I want small shop ?
In the shop was two small ?
Then I saw a porch bit
Suddenly I realised I was in someone's house
And I left and that's all I'm gonna be remembering for right now

Twenty six miles to my left, and not a single man,

There's not much in front of me, below are feet and sand

So I turn and I sit and stare, in my lap this pen and pad

I watch the water rise and fall, recede and then advance


I don't know which way I'll go, first the voice inside me says OK

I don't know which way I'll go, then the voice inside me says no way


The water's warmer than it looks, not much cooler than the air

My ankles say to walk out further but my head just wants to stare

So I sit myself down in the spot where I've been for the last hour

And wait for the sun to break the clouds, was I smart or like a coward?


I don't know which way she'll go, first the voice inside me says away

I don't know which way she'll go, then the voice inside me says she'll stay


I wanted to walk in waist deep, and fall blindly on my back

Let white and green surround my body, three feet above the sand

But I laid back and fell asleep, woke up staring at the sun,

I don't know if I will today, but so far it has been fun


I don't know which way I'll go, first the voice inside me says OK

I don't know which way she'll go, then the voice inside me says to wait

I'm this thick black curtain that you see

Invitations all went out with ease


Ninety-two chances for connection die

Replaced by pitch black and blinding light


You'll find empty space where life should be

Void of everything that you should see


Can you hear a cry for help behind this wall

Ten feet thick and twenty high?


Behind all this makeup is no one you know (Behind...)

I safely speak the truth and watch confusion grow

(Safely speak the truth and watch confusion...)


Can someone my potential realize?

Can you tear me down and show your eyes?

One more time around, I can't stop this carousel

I've tried so long to no avail

I've tried each horse on here, still no new scenery

I'm dizzy, my stomach's sick, and I'm tired


This I know, horses gold, won't take me home


Each horse here is painted so pretty

Lifeless beauties that orbit neatly

I see you go flying by, I've worn my heels down

On this game of tug-o-war I'm loosing


Stepping down, kiss the ground that will take me home


",Carousel,2003
Sean Watkins,"

Blowing trash in bitter wind, zip my sweatshirt to the top

Shoulders high and hands are hid in pockets not quite adequate

Sidewalk take me to the fire that will melt my frozen soul

Please don't let me stay this way, I'm so cold and all alone


Glass and steel cut through the wind a lake storm sent this way

Dividing up the avenues, I walk to give away the blues and take the day away


Walking quickly through the rain, I make no contact with my eyes

I weave through coats that hang on men, she is nowhere in my sight

People stand in corner crowds with eyes that point down to their wrists

Wishing they were warm inside, as they breathe into their fists


Glass and steel cut through the wind a lake storm sent this way

Dividing up the avenues, I walk to give away the blues and take away the day

I walk to give away the blues and take the day away

There are few things worse than letters never sent

Words can starve to death if they never leave the page

Leave the page for someone


He was ready to free himself from his cage, and forget all the things

That his father never gave, and ease his pain, but too late


People came to her, and sound advice she gave, but she herself could not

Take the medicine she made, to speak today, don't delay


They both wanted love, but just friends remained

Wanting to hear the word that each was scared to say

Until one day, the mail came and she read love

I saw them both and said leave me alone
Well my voice was strong
And I followed its words
They led me to nowhere and now I'm licking my wounds

Laying still but you are still asleep
You are soon to speak

They stand in the way
Complacent in May
A death row of changes awaiting their day
While they hang around town
And they follow you down
And they bang on the door 'til you're sick of the sound

Lay down what you wanted for so long
Change is what you are

Sick from birth
Awaiting the cure
To take away from my sight all of the blur
Well the forms that I see
And the colors I know
Just projections created so questions will go

Laying still but you are just asleep
You are soon to speak
Lay down what you wanted for so long
Change is what you are",Take It Away,2003
Sean Watkins,"

Write me a song I can sing all year long, and that'll send me to sleep

When there's no one beside me that I need, and the trees have all lost their leaves

And keep me alive through the spring


She said it best, didn't sound like the rest, always softly and sweet

In the sunshine I never thought to think, how could I be so naive?

But the spring time, it came and she left


Why should I care, she was never really there, a phantom girl

Or a wolf with the most amazing smile, all the while I thought otherwise

But in the spring she took off her disguise


Well I'll never forget you looking my way

And the time that we spent in the absence of games

And in the month I was gone, the amount that you changed


I need a song to keep me alive through the spring

Keep me alive through the spring

Keep me alive through the spring

Sean Watkins,"Amber called her uncle, said ""We're up here for the holiday, 
Jane and I were having Solstice, now we need a place to stay."" 
And her Christ-loving uncle watched his wife hang Mary on a tree, 
He watched his son hang candy canes all made with Red Dye No. 3. 
He told his niece, ""Its Christmas Eve, I know our life is not your style,"" 
She said, ""Christmas is like Solstice, and we miss you and its been awhile."" 

So the Christians and the Pagans sat together at the table, 
Finding faith and common ground the best that they were able, 
And just before the meal was served, hands were held and prayers were said, 
Sending hope for peace on earth to all their gods and goddesses. 

The food was great, the tree plugged in, the meal had gone without a hitch, 
Till Timmy turned to Amber and said, ""Is it true that you're a wtich?"" 
His mom jumped up and said, ""The pies are burning,"" and she hit the kitchen, 
And it was Jane who spoke, she said, ""It's true, your cousin's not a Christian,"" 
""But we love trees, we love the snow, the friends we have, the world we share, 
And you find magic from your God, and we find magic everywhere,"" 

So the Christians and the Pagans sat together at the table, 
Finding faith and common ground the best that they were able, 
And where does magic come from? I think magic's in the learning, 
'Cause now when Christians sit with Pagans only pumpkin pies are burning. 

When Amber tried to do the dishes, her aunt said, ""Really, no, don't bother."" 
Amber's uncle saw how Amber looked like Tim and like her father. 
He thought about his brother, how they hadn't spoken in a year, 
He thought he'd call him up and say, ""It's Christmas, and your daughter's here."" 
He thought of fathers, sons and brothers, saw his own son tug his sleeve, saying, 
""Can I be a Pagan?"" Dad said, ""We'll discuss it when they leave."" 

So the Christians and the Pagans sat together at the table, 
Finding faith and common ground the best that they were able, 
Lighting trees in darkness, learning new ways from the old, and 
Making sense of history and drawing warmth out of the cold.",The Christians and the Pagans,2010
Sean Watkins,"I've never had a way with women, but the hills of iowa make me wish that I could,
And I've never found a way to say I love you, but if the chance came by, oh I, I would,
But way back where I come from, we never mean to bother,
We don't like to make our passions other peoples concern,
And we walk in the world of safe people, and at night we walk into our houses and burn.

Iowa oh ooo oh, iowa oh ooooh ooo oh I-iowa
How I long to fall just a little bit, to dance out of the lines and stray from the light,
But I fear that to fall in love with you is to fall from a great and gruesome height.
So I asked a friend about it, on a bad day, her husband had just left her,
She sat down on the chair he left behind, she said,
""what is love, where did it get me? whoever thought of love is no friend of mine.""

Ioway oh ooo oh, iowa oh ooooh ooo oh I-iowa
Once I had everything, I gave it up for the shoulder of your driveway and the words I've never felt.
And so for you, I came this far across the tracks, ten miles above the limit, and with no seatbelt, and id do it again,
For tonight I went running through the screen doors of discretion,
For I woke up from a nightmare that I could not stand to see,
You were a-wandering out on the hills of iowa and you were not thinking of me.

Three days lost in this burning hell
I beg you, master, baa, help me

Eager to seek out the forbidden laws

I know you've felt them, no need to lie
Summon them and look into my eyes
I seek the gift of all gifts
Fornever laid to rest, to explore what's behind
Banished from this earth
Fornever laid to rest, invoking the sign

Entering the lost temple in the sand
Voices call my name and guide my hand
Ghosts, ghouls and demons
Quietly watch nearby

Silence, hold your tongue

Light the candles, cleanse your mind
Feel the presence, the all seeing eye

Float from the ground

My tattooed face reveals my fate
The blasphemous selling of souls
I now wear the burning signs",Fornever Laid to Rest,1992

Blinded by the visions, why have thy come

Unquestioned faith, I near the end
Old forbidden sights, the spirits descend
Wait, don't look around, not into this room
You know too well, you're not welcome in this tomb

Starless nights and burning signs
Leads me by the hand
Oh, dormant usurper
Grant me thy flaming land

I close my eyes, in the tower of baal
Knowing that I soon, shall leave you all

To rise again, as the long lost son
Soon all will be new, under the sun

Tears fill my dying eyes - for innocence is what I seek
And I hear your soul sing - as you betray the meek

You follow the filthy path - blinded by thy lust
In state of fatal lunacy - you rape my sacred trust
Your hearts stained by evil - a spiral of lies
And you cry out to me - ""Sigh, oh Lord, sigh""

Dangerous temptations - thrilling explorations
Lustres of the flesh - makes me wish for death

The angel of creation - falling black and stained

Crushed you have the palace - the temple of my prayers
You have walked the ground - of where man shouldn't dare
Tearing my soul apart - you die in my blackened heart",Reincarnage,1992

Seatrain,"She stays in a castle of her own making.
Fools in the courtyard with a jester or two.
Though the walls are made of stone, they're always shaking.
She answers to no one for what she don't do.

In the realms of confusion, she's the one who'll say, ""I know.""
She moves in her own time
And just comes to remind
That she must go.

She knows just how to walk, 
She chooses when she needs to run,
When she's alone then
She can float then.
She can fly when she's at one.

A meadow surrounds us whenever I find her.
She walks in a garden wherever she goes.
We meet on the drawbridge; guards stand behind her.
She rings with her fingers the bells on her toes.

Across crowded ballrooms I've searched, aching for a sign.
She meets none of my needs,
And still I can't leave her behind.",Portrait of the Lady as a Young Artist,1969

Cause some live in fear, oppression from peers.

And they shut their ears and laugh cause you pray,
But don't be afraid, that used to be me I used to mock God

I can see all the cold facts.
I can see through your eyes.
All this talk made no contact.
No matter how hard we tried.

31G, 31G, 31G

I can still hear the footsteps.
I can see only walls.
I slid into your man-traps,
With no hearing at all.
I just see contradiction,
Had to give up the fight,
Just to live in the past tense,
To make believe you were right.

Loved you so sincere
Through all the shit-stained curtains

Close to death, foolish and trashed
Heart drawn in ashes; drink down another glass
I wish that I couldn't stand
We could put this cyclone in a trance
Believe you angelic one, my nerves are tried
I aim to conquer and divide

I'm not jerkin' to lose my mind again
I'm not smart enough to fake it
No fool could fake a feeling this good
C'mon girl, let's walk through this perverted world
A few times; it's too insane

Free to let her spirit fly, left my choking stare behind
Maybe if her will could grow, she might feel the need to leave
Dying in my shadow, doubting I could ever let her be herself
A sinful reflection of me, will I ever set her free?
My love has shut her up, break the spirit I don't understand
'cause even as we're walking hand in hand, my life cuts her up
An evil way to build me strong, a sad judge and so uptight
It's too bad I'm so hung up
I ask a simple question when I know the answer right
I ask me if I love her as I tell her it's all right
But nothing in my life would fit, I turned into an idiot
Vampire, draining her desire
Vampire, smother her with love
When nothing in her life would fit she came upon an idiot

And I would never dare to break her heart
Too scared and selfish to watch my security fall

I will give them all control, I will crumble all around
There's no need to say a word as logic burns right trough my head

That thing I felt when we first met just will not suffice

It took a while but I learned, it took a twist but I turned
And now its clear that I'm blind, another mountain to climb
Another distance to fall, I couldn't help it all

I'll cut you loose and watch you fall
It feels good just to bitch about it
Scratch that itch until it bleeds
But I don't really wanna lose you
But I can't play the silent game
'cause when I talk the silence follows
You never say what's on your mind
If you laugh to see me so defensive
I'll know I've made another enemy
Nobody wants another mirror on their fears
I guess that's all you are to me

Empty to be filled with the hunger for more

Stand shoulders above her
Pick her up when you love her
Rub it right when you use her

Shallow as the brook out back
Bedtime stories that you can't take back

That are nothing like you
There's no need to condescend
Not knowing, careful to pretend
Give away your fucked-up friends
Tired news and damaged trends

And I hesitate to say that you're a liar
I never tell the truth myself
But I tried to chase you down and I got tired
So I'm leaving you to you or someone else
'Cause you never want to hook up in the middle
And I'd meet you there to talk if you would show
But you answer every question with a riddle
And refuse to even choose to let me go
It used to be I'd tell you all my secrets
Giving you the credit you deserve
I guess you didn't care to lose or keep it
And we never quite connected from the first
And I wish I had a way to make it better
To rearrange the world and make you smile
But it's dumb to even think I had that power
And we haven't been that close in a while
And I don't even want to try to name it
Explain it for the one who couldn't care
'Cause all that matters is the way you choose to frame it
And I hesitate to say that you're a liar

It's burning the world through
But don't hold it against me,

But I don't wanna fight just yet, I wanted to see what would happen

Know who deserves it, who got there first
Who lied about it and made things worse
See, it don't matter I've only begun to confuse you
It's what I do
Here's an open-ended threat to tip the balance we've been riding

Swallowed in some detail, heavy in my blood
I wanna hold you close, but I can't lift my arms up
Is there a reason for this distance?
More than the drug that floats my days
A nervous bug in my system, it keeps me edgy and ashamed
I've got a saint, never ever will forgive
That never understood me but still tells me how to live
It fits when I stretch and I stretch because I can
I stretch until I'm sore and then I open up for more
I do it out of habit, not addiction
And if I give it up, clean out my blood
Will I still feel bored and disconnected?
If I do it all for love, will I ever give enough?

And no one's sure if we should be together
But oh, when I saw you again
A beautiful friend, she opened up her heart and let me in
No, I cannot lie to you
I'm still in love with you, and I only wanna be with you

and invited y'all to test me wherever they MIGHT HANG?

See we managed to find them flows somehow it's EASY Y'ALL
Take the hardest Timmy beat massage it and MAKE IT SOFT
Go 'head take it off, I won't tell yo' daddy baby
I always had game but I've been extra savvy lately
You probably saw me at the corners in that candy Dodge Ram
Folks who ain't heard the news say, ""Look at Andy, God damn""
That must be renowned fam cause I ain't even got a Dodge
But still that same raggy, quite import in my garage
I swear on every ounce of blood in my mama's veins
that I walk these dogs across this country twice to stop the pain
So I'm handin Tim the leash and when I do I hope you cry
Now tell these sons of bitches get this gate, OPEN WIDE

But that, time gave me too much, thank God, I finally grew up
How could, I bring this so raw? Pack up, sing your shit on law
You mad? Well then that's yo' loss; that's why, yo' bitch is on toss
Drink up, if you really want to run, y'all wild like Timmy on the drums
They know, not to get me on the rum
Four-fifth, that is heavy when I'm done
y'all want me to bust? y'all sure y'all want me to bust?
I'm in the zone to bust - goin adjust to the home of the fuss
Am I versatile? Probably the best y'all heard in a while
Have mercy child - don't just shake it twerk it with style
Don't y'all love when I talk? How I sell it the way it was bought
The way I was taught - really I fought this battle for naught
And in conclusion - let me say that I'm on yo' side

I was sippin pro, Remi slow, did enough to breakin the law
Flavors froze, songs I chose 'til I get the crowd involved
So I do shows and I lift clothes and point the mic to y'all
Which pistol, could get yo', eyes away from the bar?
Problem solved, stir and call the food court in the mall
And any chick, that I saw, I got her number and all
Help me y'all, if her closet is too small
for some domino drawers or a piece of her, bra
I would reckon that one of her damn digits is off
I legitamately call and end up with a pizza that's large
So I'm, sick of you broads and you, neighborhood stars
Don't care about your cars like Bubba get out the yard
Listen, damnit Bubba pay attention to my hoes with extension
Got my vogues on suspension, got my pushes in the kitchen
Got my streets, on a mission; got my corners with they trickin

Is do you think I give a fuck?
Riddle me that
'Cause in my hood, and you jump into hell and back
This industry shit - to hell wit' that
I seen 'em come, I seen 'em go
I doubt if you can show me somethin' I ain't seen before
Who supposed to be in charge? I need to know
When I shake your hand, I'm a step on your toe
Go get ya gun, go get ya click
I'm a be right here chillin' wit' yo' bitch

Well, put the pistol to your head and empty the clip

Feel my pain

How they follow little trends to get they fame
I ain't snappin' my damn fingers to get in the game
You claim you rich
Show me, son
If you got so many dollas, then loan me one
Fools think they killas - they own a gun
When you know you 'bout as sweet as a honey bun
Trash your broads behind a bar
Like you dat dude frontin' hard
VIP bands don't make you a star
Like we really still don't know who the fuck you are
Don't talk behind my back, just call me nigga
Move my heart to the side
Make room to forgive ya
If you still wanna hang
We'll come to get ya

Share a bowl of crunch berries, how real is that? ha ha

And every time I catch me with tears

I will be right there by Your Side 
You know I'll never hurt so much 
When I lost you I was blind 
And every time I catch me with tears 
You are right there by my side 

I stare into his eyes and then I see your face 
A dying love inside 
A love you can't replace 
You're looking down with pride 
And let me show what I Can tell 

So long my dear departed
Where did you go
I cant believe your gone, and
My life goes on so slow

You know I'll never let you go 
You know I'll never hurt so bad 
And if It takes a thousand Years 
I will be right there By Your Side 
You know I'll never hurt so much 
When I lost you I was blind 
And every time I catch me with tears 
You are right there by my side",By Your Side,2007
Sebastian Bach,"Here I am
Slippin' back in time
Starin' in your eyes
Like it's all the same
Look at you
You haven't changed at all
The devil's Deja vu
Has lead me down
& back into this deadly fall

You take me
Break me
Build me up & then forsake me
Our love is my world
Then you cut me down with one word
Strung out, it's true
Try to run but I'm falling into you
You're the devil's deja vu

Bring it on
Bend my will again
Undress the story's end
& make this heart believe
There's a light
In the darkness of my mind
Hangin' by a thread
Like a spider
Spinnin' out a brand new web

You take me
Break me
Build me up & then forsake me
Our love is my world
Then you cut me down with one word
Strung out, it's true
Try to run but I'm falling into you
You're the devil's deja vu

Think about me
Our love is your salvation
Taste my mind
Give in to all temptation
Embrace complete destruction
Wait wait wait wait wait wait

You take me
Break me
Build me up & then forsake me
Our love is my world
Then you cut me down with one word
Strung out, it's true
Try to run but I'm falling into you
You're the devil's deja vu
",Falling into You,2007
Sebastian Bach,"Where do we fit in a world that sell us lies?
It's so hard to be your perfect kind
Truth is vital yes that's what's inside
Cover yourself
You yourself deny

Like stars sky high, we live & die
Free your body your soul your mind
Where do I fit in a world that sells me lies?
It's so hard to be your perfect kind

Blessed with light and showered in dark
While we're here we'll make our mark
Blessed with light and scarred by pain
Roll the dice begin again

Don't be afraid to win or lose
The money stays, but the pain stays with you
We are showered in dark
And scarred by the pain

Begin again

Under her skies",Live & Die,2007
Sebastian Bach,"Nothin' lasts forever
Nobody rides for free
For twenty years I took a stand
You're not takin' no chance on me

Some slow to anger
Some quick to hate
When you've given all you got
And you just can't satiate

We all live in negative
Can we ride to the light?

Deal in desperation
Peddling in spite
If it's a war you're lookin' for
You won't look far tonight

I'm sick of restitution
Paying back in blood
All I ever wanted was a little action
And maybe just a little love

We all live in negative
Can we ride to the light?

Why you gotta make it harder than it has to be?
We could come together
And show the world we're free
Break free!

I never needed what I never get

What id I told you a secret?
You promise you'll never tell?
I wanna get into you now baby
Get me outta this hell

Semi-good lookin' seducer
Slither in the street
I gotta suck out the venom
Desire's killin' me

So go ahead and shoot me
Cause I ain't goin' down
Aim and fire your best shot
And I ain't hittin' the ground

What if i told you a secret?

And then you said, it's over

'Cause I'm stuck inside

I won't let you break away
I know your feelings change
From everything you said today
Peeling the layers of emotions away
I'm breaking down again, you'll see

I need just one more special thing

All my live is empty, now I said, it's over

And all the tears you cried, that called my name
And when you needed me I came through

I paint a picture of the days gone by
When love went blind and you would make me see
Id stare a lifetime into your eyes
So that I knew you were there for me
Time after time you were there for me

Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand, I remember you
Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
Id wanna hear you say, I remember you

We spend the summer with the top rolled down
Wished ever after would be like this
You said I love you babe, without a sound
I said Id give my life for just one kiss
Id live for your smile and die for your kiss

Through the sleepless nights and every endless day

But that's the price we paid
And through it all we kept the promise that we made
I swear you'll never be lonely

But nothing else could ever take you away
Cause you'll always be my dream come true

Sebastian Ingrosso,"Yeah, it's ninety-seven going into ninety-eight,
And I've been doin' this for mad years, payin' dues.
This is my heart, my purpose in life,
And finally I'm on.
Which brings me to realise that the tough life that I had only made me 
Stronger, true.

[Chorus]
Richard Stites
A ha, ha, ha, ha.
I know this much is true.
A ha, ha, ha, ha.
I know this much is true.

Growin' up, didn't want to have nothing to do wit' you.
Make you hittin' everybody went to high school wit' you.
Want to play you close and jump in the pool wit' you.
I don't know what to do, but this much is true,
And in the hood, they all like to knock your career,
And turn right around when you hot a gear.
I played Midas and told them that it's God I fear;
That the man upstairs, he control this here.
And it's funny how soon as the money piles,
Everybody want to play with that brother now.
Run me down, but when the dough gets low, only a few friends roll, you know.
And Mama, bless her heart, she used to give me strife,
Said ""Lynisse, please do something with your life.""
And how it's gon' play out, I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

[Chorus]

And I remember when, I used to feen for calls;
When I hit number one I had to scream out calls.
Used to see my Mama strugglin', worn from work;
Told her when I made it big she never gonna work.
I used to wish at night that my brothers in the street,
Hustlin', shit, they would live to the light,
And see another day somehow, find another way I vow.
To all my soldiers I hold you down.
From standin' in the rain, to the rovers now.
I'm screamin your name, to warn you that the rollers is around.
To on-stage, throwin' it down.
No matter where you at, represent your hood.
No matter where I'm at, I'm representing my hood.
And how it's gon' all play out I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

[Chorus]

I've opened up my eyes to a brighter day,
Nobody in the block gave their life away.
We all tryin' to take it easily,
And everybody want to make it seems is free.
Today it's all good, and it seemes so strange,
Since you look up in the hood now, things done changed.
Kids they used to be wheelies for blocks,
Is out ridin' their bikes, doin' wheelies for blocks,
And bitches on the bench, still gossipin', who's she slidin' in,
Who's she slidin' with, outside partyin'.
Old timers in the back playin' dominoes.
Kids freestyling, all kinds of flows.
Girls flow through with designer clothes.
It's day now, but you know how night time goes,
And how it's gon' play out I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

I know your love is tender and warm

Well you looked right through me when you turned and walked away

Touch me their coldness
And thoughts I can't repeat
Shock me with their boldness
Why did my mind and body believe,
That you would never leave them
Now there's parts of me that blame,
Or well they force me to deceive them
So come back and relieve them

Who would steal you?
I still feel you
Now you're gone
These are lies
They're not real
This is more than I can feel
This is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong

A bath so hot it almost scolds
And I let the warm surround me
I slide down
Till only my face shows
But I feel colder now
Than before you found me
When u used to pin me down
The clarity in your intent
But if you mind was somewhere else
I cant better anything you can invent
I thought you understood how much you meant

Who would steal you?
I still feel you
Now you're gone
And these are lies
It's not real
This is more than I can feel
It's all wrong
Now you're gone
I work hard to carry on
If you could've seen
How I've been
Then you'd know how much you meant

Who would steal you
I feel you
Now you're gone

Sebastian Vogel,"In the wee hours of the morning
When everything is still
I lay staring at the darkness
Trying to find the will
Only to be plagues 
By roaches, scorpions and mice
Not to mention politics
That's a big cockatrice

The light became morning
The morning became day
Speaking for myself
I wish the darkness had stayed

The morning become evening
The sun is going down 
But equality and justice 
Is nowhere to be found
Of all this place
I've had my fill
Even in the wee hours of the morning
When everything is still",Best of Both Worlds,2001
Sebastian Vogel,"Manchmal redest du im Schlaf
Meistens keine ganzen Sätze
Einzelne Worte oder Fetzen
Die ich kaum verstehen kann
Manchmal verdrehst du deine Augen
Unter den verschlossenen Lidern
Machst eine Geste dann und wann
Die ich nicht erwidern kann
Was sich aus deinen Träumen
In unserer beide Tage trägt
Hat keinen Ort in der Erinnerung
Nur ein stiller Schmerz
Bleibt zurück in deinem Herz
Im ersten Licht des Morgens

Manchmal redest du im Schlaf
Von noch nie betretenen Orten
Mit noch unverwandten Worten
In mir unbekannten Sprachen
Wenn wir bei Tageslicht aufwachen
Und bevor wir ganz aufsteh'n
Redest du manchmal von Sachen
Von denen ich nicht viel versteh'
Nur ein stiller Schmerz bleibt
Zurück in meinem Herz

Wir reden manchmal wie im Schlaf
Von noch nie betret'nen Orten
Von einer Zeit in ferner Zukunft
In einer Sprache deren Worte
Wir noch lange kaum beherrschen
Der wir uns blindlings anvertrauen
Gegen die Regeln der Vernunft
Reden wir manchmal wie im Traum
Was sich aus unseren Träumen
In jeden unserer Tage trägt
Hat keinen Ort in der Erinnerung
Nur ein stiller Schmerz
Bleibt zurück in unser'm Herz
Im ersten Licht des Morgens

Manchmal redest du im Schlaf
Von noch nie betret'nen Orten

Von denen ich nicht viel versteh'",Im Ersten Licht,2001

Die Dunkelheit bricht ein
Das Haus steht still
Wir sind allein
Die Nacht liegt schwer
Um uns herum
Ein stiller Schmerz
Hält uns noch wach

Kein Tag der die Wunden
Zu heilen vermag
Uns bleibt ein Versprechen
Uns nicht zu verlieren

Sebastian Yatra,"No me salen las palabras, para expresarte que te quiero 
No sé cómo explicarte, que me haces sentir 
Como si fuera el verano, y el invierno no existiera 
Como se separa todo 
Y con esa sonrisa, que cambia la vida 
Miraste hacia aquí, y ya no puedo contemplar
Que tú no seas la que me ama

Y cómo mirarte, esos ojos que me dejan en enero
Cuando sé que no son míos y me muero 
El destino no nos quiere ver pasar 
Oh y cómo decirte, que no quiero que este amor sea pasajero
Que de pronto se dé un día y yo te espero
El destino no nos tiene que importar

No sé cómo ser yo mismo si no estás al lado mío
Se harán largos estos meses, si no estás junto a mí 
Y con esa sonrisa, que nunca se olvida
Llegaste y te vi y ya no puedo soportar que tú no seas la que me ama 

Y cómo mirarte, esos ojos que me dejan en enero
Cuando sé que no son míos y me muero 
El destino no nos quiere ver pasar
Oh, y como decirte, que no quiero que este amor sea pasajero
Que de pronto se dé un día y yo te espero
El destino no nos tiene que importar

Y cómo olvidarte, si la vida me enseñó que vas primero
No me importa la distancia, yo te quiero
Y al final sé que a mi lado vas a estar

Voy a esperarte, cuando se ama de verdad
No existe el tiempo
Y te juro que no es el final del cuento
El destino no nos puede separar

Sebastian Yatra,"Ya sé que no te importa aparecerte hoy
Y sabes cómo duele decirte no más 
Pero es que para amar se necesitan dos 
Y tu hace mucho que no estas 
Y aunque suene a mentira, yo estaba mejor 

La vida me enseño como vivir sin ti 
Y pude ser feliz aunque no estás aquí 
Entiende que no quiero que digas perdón 
Y me entra la inseguridad 
Sabes que nunca supe decirte que no 
Para olvidar 

Devuélveme mis sueños 
Quédate tu voz 
Y aunque no quieras verlo, ya no somos dos 
Yo voy a hacerme el fuerte, no quiero verte 
Para olvidar 
Lo que sentías por dentro si estabas aquí 
Tus besos, mis canciones, las noches sin dormir 
Ya sabes que se siente, no quiero verte 
Para olvidar oh oh, oh oh, oh oh 
Para olvidar oh oh, oh oh, oh oh 

He jurado en una y mil canciones ya no estar contigo oh
Luego llega siempre esta locura y vuelvo a ser tu amigo oh

Vine a perder el miedo a quedarme solo 
Cuando me duele que no estas lo ignoro 
Hay que llorar para reír 
Para olvidar hay que sufrir oh oh oh

Son muchos años que pasaron sin decir te quiero 
Y en verdad te quiero 
Pero encuentro formas de engañar mi corazón 

Son muchos años que pasaron sin robarte un beso 
Solo quiero un beso, 
y por esa boca no me importa ser ladrón 

No puede ser que no he encontrado todavía las palabras 
Y en esa noche no dije nada 
No puede ser que en un segundo me perdí en tu mirada 
Cuando por dentro yo te gritaba 

Déjame robarte un beso que me llegue hasta el alma

Sé que sientes mariposas, yo también sentí sus alas

Déjame que con un beso nos perdamos los dos

Ella se va conmigo 
Pero no soy su amigo 
Desde hace mucho tiempo pude ser algo más 

Y aunque su corazón tenga una clave 
Nadie lo sabe pero tengo la llave 
Desde hace mucho tiempo la aprendí a enamorar 

Lo que le gusta es que le cante al oído en la noche 
Que la mire, que le diga te quiero otra vez 
Ella le pide que le dé el corazón solo a ella 
Yo le digo que me tiene soñando otra vez 

Lo que le gusta es que (Otra vez, otra vez) 
Ella me pide que (Otra vez, otra vez) 

Lo que le gusta es que le dé 
Ram pam pa pa pam 
Porque dice que le doy, lo que otros no le dan 
Dice que cuando yo estoy, las tristezas se van 
Pero no estando yo vuelve a sentirse tan sola 

Como Eva en el paraíso sin Adán 
Pasando las noches frías, los días sin sol 
Pues soy yo el que le da calor (Prrr) 
Cuando tiene frío y nunca me quedo dormido 
Le doy cariño y amor antes 

Yo a ella la mimo, la consiento y la hago happy 
Le digo mami te quiero y ella me dice ""I love you papi""
Es fanática de como canto 
Yo soy fanático de como ella baila
Y rompe caderas como si fueran de plástico 

Oh wow 
Me tiene hookeao'
Me tiene latiendo el corazón acelerao' de tanto amor 
Porque ella es mi super estrella su galán soy yo (Su galán soy yo) 

Lo que le gusta es que le cante al oído en la noche 
Que la mire, que le diga ""te quiero"" otra vez

A ella le gusta como yo le canto 
Y a mí me gusta su cara 
Y me reclama que no soy un santo 
Pero igualmente me llama

Y me da miedo estarme enamorando 
Pero uno ama a quien ama

Que la mire que le diga ""te quiero otra vez

De qué tuyo es mi corazón",Contigo Siempre,2018

Piensas en mí, di lo contrario
Puedes mentir si es necesario
Pero lo que yo te di sigue ahí
Guardado dentro de ti, sigue ahí

Ya sé que aquí todo ha cambiado
Y cada quien va por su lado
Pero es que yo sigo aquí, sigo aquí
Soñando con verte, yeah eh

Y tú ahí como si nada, como si nada
Y yo quedándome sin nada, como si nada
Y yo queriendo volver (eh)
Pa' quedarme contigo (eh)
Estoy arrepentido y ya no sé qué hacer

Y sigo aquí como si nada, como si nada, yo
Y tú no quieres nada, no quieres nada
Y yo queriendo volver (eh)
Pa' quedarme contigo (eh)
Estoy arrepentido y ya no sé qué hacer

Cali

Vuelvo a esa noche, recuerdo la rabia
Tan fuerte que no me deja ver (ver)
Como fácil tus ojos se llenan de agua
Más fácil es hacerte llover (-ver)
Como el arrepentimiento que te deja lejos
Cuando se hace dueño de tu boca
Y habla con más fuego que palabras
Y mis ojos se cerraron pero no estoy ciego
Y aunque nunca te lloraron, perdimos el juego

Ver que tú sigues tu vida y me quitas la mía
Juré ser el fuerte y que no pasaría
Que incluso llorando se curan heridas
Primero me amas y luego me olvidas

Ya agoté el abecedario, ya no quedan rimas
Y en la cima de tu orgullo tanto me lastimas
Y me duele ver tu calendario lleno de mentiras
Y aunque quieras darme celos me das ira
Vete

El amor, el amor, el amor
Me castiga y me obliga a perder
El amor, el amor, el amor
En el piso me quiere vencer
Y me cambia besos por dolor
Porque sabe que tiene el poder
De robarme los sueños y ver
Que al mostrarme que ya mi mujer tiene dueño

Y yo puedo perderme, quiero devolverme
Y decirte que no aguanto no poder tenerte
Que fue culpa mía, que no fue la suerte
Aceptarlo todo, no quiero perderte
Yo soy el culpable, tú eres inocente
Que te quiero tanto, yo te quiero tanto y ya no puedo verte, huh

Y tú ahí como si nada, como si nada
Y yo quedándome sin nada, como si nada
Y yo queriendo volver (eh)
Pa' quedarme contigo (eh)
Estoy arrepentido y ya no sé qué hacer

Y sigo aquí como si nada, como si nada, yo
Y tú no quieres nada, no quieres nada
Y yo queriendo volver (eh)
Pa' quedarme contigo (eh)
Estoy arrepentido y ya no sé qué hacer

Y estás ahí como si nada (como si nada)
Y yo me quedo aquí sin nada (como si nada)
Sin ti (sin ti)
Sin mí, (sin, Yatra Yatra)

Cada vez que pienses en estar conmigo
Llámame, que el tiempo pasa y aquí sigo (eh)
Pa' quedarme contigo (eh)
Estoy arrepentido y ya no sé qué hacer
Y ya no sé qué hacer

Cada vez (no)
Que pienses en estar conmigo
Llámame (-me)

Si pudieras ver cómo estoy 
Hecho mierda sin ti 
Escondiendo el dolor 

Me deprime cada canción 
Esas que hablan de amor 
Como el que yo perdí 

De Lunes a Jueves sé disimular 
Pero llega el weekend y me pongo mal 
Trato de ignorarlo y me voy a rumbear 
Con un par de amigas para impresionar 

Pero cada vez que siento el celular 
Pienso que eres tú que vuelves a llamar 
Y me pega duro tanta soledad 
Después de unos tragos sale la verdad 

Estoy borracho otra vez 
Intentando entender 
Cómo es que tú puedes olvidarme 
Mientras yo quisiera devorarte 

Estoy tomando otra vez 
Después que lo dejé
Y esta noche en vez de olvidarte 
Yo sigo extrañándote 

No sé por qué

Dime dónde estás, no te consigo 
Ando borracho, loco y quiero volver contigo 
Hoy no somos nada, ni amigos, ni enemigos 
Pero cuando tomo pienso en darte castigo, yeah yeah 

Sólo llama 
Cuando tú me pienses en tu cama 
No te creas lo que dicen de mi fama 
Estás con otro, pero sé que tú me amas 
Me amas, yeah yeah

And you're tired of your Dad
Got you jumping through hoops
Got you shaving your legs
Let it pass, let it pass, let it pass over you

And you're tired of your face
And you're tired of your nose
Got you jumping through hoops
Got you shaving your legs
Let it pass, let it pass, let it pass over you

And your nose is bleeding
You've been lying to me

There will be no hesitation
There will be no confrontation
There will be no indication
There will be no cause
There will be no exultation
There will be no justification
There will be no way at all

And your nose is bleeding
You've been lying to me

Luno
Come back to me the the way you were
The way you were when we were young
I'm trying to tell you everything
I'm trying to tell you everything

I can heal the blind 
I can cure the sick
I can say the right things
I can say the right things
Where d'you get so cruel
Where do you go
Cos you're never here

And your nose is bleeding
You deserve it
You've been lying to me

Sébastien Lacombe,"Allez, un peu d’humanitaire
Faire un sourire planétaire
Faut pas nous prendre pour des cons
Y’a quelques chose qui ne tourne pas rond

Allez, la liberté d’expression
La libération de la raison
Faudrait penser à demain
Casser la gueule à la faim

Allez, tout doit changer
Allez, tout doit changer

Allez, métisser toutes les couleurs
Faire l’amour à la peur
Allez, le pouvoir est aux crayons
La pollution n’est plus une option

Allez, un abri pour l’univers
Et des habits pendant l’hiver
Allez, coup balai dans le système
On verra bien où ça nous mène

Allez, tout doit changer
Allez, tout doit changer

Faut pas penser que la terre, est un bon coup aux enchères
Faut pas penser qu’une frontière
C’est une raison de faire la guerre
Faut pas penser que la différence
Est l’ennemie des ressemblances
Et puis un jour y’aura la révolution
Pour tous les cons, c’est la prison

Allez, tout va changer
Allez, tout va changer",Allez,2012
Sebastien Lefebvre,"I fall asleep by the telephone
It's two o'clock and I'm waiting up alone
Tell me, where have you been?
I found a note with another name
You blow a kiss
But it just don't feel the same
Cause I can feel that you're gone

Can't bite my tongue forever
While you try to play it cool
You can hide behind your stories
But don't take me for a fool

You can tell me there's nobody else
(But I feel it)
You can tell me that you're home by yourself
(But I see it)
You can look into my eyes
And pretend all you want
But I know
I know your love is just a lie
It's nothing but a lie

You look so innocent
But the guilt in your voice gives you away
Yeah, you know what I mean
How does it feel when you kiss
When you know that I trust you?
And do you think about me when he fucks you?
And could you be more obscene?

So don't try to say you're sorry
Or try to make it right
And don't waste your breath
Because it's too late, it's too late

You can tell me there's nobody else
(But I feel it)
You can tell me that you're home by yourself
(But I see it)
You can look into my eyes
And pretend all you want
But I know
I know your love is just a lie, lie
It's nothing but a lie, lie
You're nothing but a lie

You can tell me there's nobody else
(But I feel it)
You can tell me that you're home by yourself
(But I see it)
You can look into my eyes
And pretend all you want
But I know

I know your love is just a lie

I know you're nothing but a lie, lie
You're nothing but a lie, lie
Your love is just a lie",Your Love Is a Lie,2008

By your story and the way you explained me
How you start to make this change
It was frightening , It’s surprising
You come to play and lost control
But your childhood shows instead and (it)breaks you down

Keep it strong  keep us strong

you come with self restrain too 
it's a better choice  

all this time you're waiting 
to come closer  you're wanting 
with all your soul
but it starts to drive you insane
when the days are closing in
you lose control 

you never felt so odd since you're out of time
your will will never stop you  waste time
you cannot take your fate when it's coming along 
I bet you if you stay you will just feel it's too long

if the houses and building are trembling i will always be here

in your white  dress  twirling  around
jumping in  the waves  and laughing

for this star , you would  have  traveled 
you would  have searched  to find by train

Secret Garden,"The wheels of life keep turning.
Spinning without control;
The wheels of the heart keep yearning.
For the sound of the singing soul.
And nights are full with weeping.
For sins of the past we've sown;
But, tomorrow is ours for the keeping,
Tomorrow the future's shown.

Lift your eyes and see the glory.
Where the circle of life is drawn;
See the never-ending story,
Come with me to the Gates of Dawn.

And whose is the hand who raises
The sun from the heaving sea?
The power that ever amazes –
We look, but never will see?
Who scattered the seeds so life could be,
Who coloured the fields of corn?
Who formed the mould that made me – me,
Before the world was born?

Lift your eyes and see the glory.
Where the circle of life is drawn;
See the never-ending story,
Come with me to the Gates of Dawn.

Secret Garden,"I remember a meadow one morning in May
With a sky full of dreams that sailed in that day
I was dancing through green waves of grass like the sea
For a moment in time I could feel I was free

There are waves of forgiveness and waves of regret
And the first waves of true love I'll never forget
In the meadow that morning as I wandered alone
There were green waves of yearning for life
Still unknown

Take me home to the meadow that cradles my heart
Where the waves reach as far as you can see
Take me home to the meadow we've been too long apart
I can still hear you calling for me

Take me home to the meadow that cradles my heart
Where the waves reach as far as you can see
Take me home to the meadow we've been too long apart
I can still hear you calling for me

What I'd give to remember that heavenly state
Just a moment in time all mine to create
As I'm taking my last breath, I know what I'll see
There'll be green waves forever out there waiting for me

When the piper's call is ringing
Then shall my soul be ever homeward bound

If you just give a little all you gotta do is trust me
Break free from this feeling in me

Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over.

And the circling is worth it.
Finding beauty in the dissonance.
There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away.
