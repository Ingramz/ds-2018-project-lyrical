Flunky,"How does it feel to treat me like you do? 
When you've laid your hands upon me and told me who you are. 
I thought I was mistaken, I thought I heard your words. 
Tell me how do I feel. Tell me now, how do I feel. 

Those who came before me lived through their vocations 
from the past until completion, they'll turn away no more. 
And still I find it so hard to say what I need to say. 
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me just how I should feel today. 

I see a ship in the harbor. I can and shall obey. 
But if it wasn't for your misfortune, I'd be a heavenly person today. 
And I thought I was mistaken, and I thought I heard you speak 
Tell me, how do I feel. Tell me now, how should I feel. 

Now I stand here waiting... 
I thought I told you to leave me when I walked down to the beach. 
Tell me how does it feel, when your heart grows cold, grows cold, cold.",Blue Monday,2007
Flutter,"There's such a sad love
Deep in your eyes A kind of pale jewel
Open and closed Within your eyes
I'll place the sky
Within your eyes

There's such a fooled heart
Beatin' so fast
In search of new dreams
A love that will last
Within your heart
I'll place the moon
Within your heart

As the pain sweeps through,
Makes no sense for you
Every thrill is gone
Wasn't too much fun at all,
But I'll be there for you
As the world falls down

Falling
Falling down
Falling in love

I'll paint you mornings of gold
I'll spin you Valentine evenings
Though we're strangers 'til now,
We're choosing the path
Between the stars
I'll leave my love
Between the stars

As the pain sweeps through,
Makes no sense for you
Every thrill is gone
Wasn't too much fun at all,
But I'll be there for you-ou-ou
As the world falls down

Fluttershy,"Hey, now, don't be sad 
I know we cannot stay 
But we've got a couple minutes 
And a little time to play 

I know you have important things 
So it's okay, just go 

But we can still pick one small, little thing 
To do with you, y'know! 

One small thing doesn't seem like a lot 
One small thing, work with the time you've got 
Soon, one small thing becomes two 
After two, perhaps another few 
Then one small thing is not so small 
One small thing can be the biggest thing of all 

All right now, since you're here 
Let's see what we can do 
Swim with the flow until you go 
Together, me and you 

I've got necklaces for every fish 
So what else do ya got? 

Well, we could play the bubblefish 
You'll like this one a lot! 

One small thing, it's a good place to start 

(Just one small thing) 

One small thing, and we don't seem so far apart 

(Don't seem apart) 

Soon, one small thing leads to more 
It's so much more than there was before 
Just one small thing, and you will see 
The start of something big for you and me 

One small thing 

Just one small thing 

Or a tall thing 

Just one tall thing 

Or a sing thing 

Just one sing-y thing 

Or a bling thing 

Just one bling-y thing 

A conga thing 

Yeah, a conga thing 

Or a longah thing 

Just one longah thing 

A blue thing, true thing, you thing (ooh-ooh) 

A whee thing, sea thing, me thing (ooh-ooh-ooh)

So many things and everything until our time is done 
There's one small thing for each and everyone! 

One small thing, so much we can create 
You and me, we started something great 
It's so amazing, look around 
At all the happy sights and sounds 
One small thing is big, it's true 
You did this all for us 
I just wish there was one small thing 
An extra special kind of thing 

That we could do for you
One small thing!",One Small Thing,2017
Fluttershy,"I know the world can get you down
Things don't work out quite the way that you thought
Feeling like all your best days are done
Your fears and doubts are all you've got

But there's a light, shining deep inside
Beneath those fears and doubts so just squash 'em
And let it shine for all the world to see
That it is time, yeah, time to be awesome

Ah, ah ah, ah, awesome
It's time to be so awesome
Ah, ah ah, ah, awesome
It's time to be so awesome

You've no idea how hard it's been (it's time to be so awesome)
This dull routine we've been forced to do

Don't let them rob you of who you are
Be awesome, it's all up to you (awesome)

I feel the light, stirring deep inside
It's like a tale still yet to be told (it's time to be so awesome)

And now it's time
To break the shackles free
And start living like
The brave and the bold

It's time to be awesome
Let loose, be true, so awesome
It's time to be awesome
Go big, be you, so awesome

We used to soar through the clouds in the skies

Elaborate schemes we would love to devise

We rescued our treasure and stored it away

Saving those gemstones for a rainy day

We see that light
Filling up our skies

So take the Storm King's orders and toss 'em

'Cause it's the time to let our colors fly

Hey Scallywags, it's time to be awesome

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey",Time to Be Awesome,2017
Flux,"Coming loose, at the seams
Blind spots, voices
Controls gone, I'm like a balloon
Cut it out, emotion

Distance, it grows now
You don't, reach for me
All I got, all I got
Is my scars

Flux Fiddlers,"So Sgt. Pepper took you by surprise
You better see right through that mother's eyes
Those freaks was right when they said you was dead
The one mistake you made was in your head

Ah, how do you sleep
Ah, how do you sleep at night

You live with straights who tell you, you was king
Jump when your momma tell you anything
The only thing you done was yesterday
And since you're gone you're just another day

Ah, how do you sleep
Ah, how do you sleep at night

Ah, how do you sleep
Ah, how do you sleep at night

A pretty face may last a year or two
But pretty soon they'll see what you can do

You must have learned something in all those years

Ah, how do you sleep at night",How Do You Sleep?,1971
Flux Fiddlers,"How can I go forward when I don't know which way I'm facing
How can I go forward when I don't know which way to turn
How can I go forward into something I'm not sure of
Oh no, oh no

How can I have feeling when I don't know if it's a feeling
How can I feel something if I just don't know how to feel
How can I have feelings when my feelings have always been denied
Oh no, oh no

You know life can be long
And you got to be so strong
And the world is so tough
Sometimes I feel I've had enough

How can I give love when I don't know what it is I'm giving
How can I give love when I just don't know how to give
How can I give love when love is something I ain't never had
Oh no, oh no

You know life can be long
You've got to be so strong
And the world she is tough
Sometimes I feel I've had enough

How can we go forward when we don't know which way we're facing

Flux Fiddlers,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine all the people
Living for today (ah ah ah)

Imagine there's no countries

Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion, too

Imagine all the people

But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us

Flux of Pink Indians,"The wind blows, the baby cries
People die, their deaths are untold
Land is desolate, nothing here grows
People living, for the sight of a food bowl
Trapped in an existence, it's hard to think
Such people really exist, hard to believe
Their plight is accepted
When money so wasted could be redirected
They're not some race that don't feel pain
Stravation is something you don't become immune to",Song for Them,1982
Flux of Pink Indians,"I love tube disasters
I wanna marry a tube disaster
I want another one like the last one
'Cause I live for tube disasters, yeah

Build up some speed, don't shut your eyes
Make sure that everyone in the train dies
You don't get no prize, no time to say goodbyes
Just smile everyone, you'll be on TV tonight, that's right

I love tube disasters
I wanna marry a tube disaster
I want another one like the last one
'Cause I live for tube disasters, yeah

Go through a wall, forget about the brake
It's so much easier than the pills you can take
I go through moorgate and I'm wide awake
But no bloody driver's gone and made a mistake, that's yet
Is it me that needs a home?

Flux of Pink Indians,"Can ye smell the neu smell, tumbling through the air?
Aye, I can lad
It's coming from over there

Parliament says it's safe
Well why not bury it there?",Neu Smell,1989
Flux of Pink Indians,"Used to graze in a field
Used to breathe, I used to be alive
Did chew the grass in the field
Could see and hear the world around me
See and fear man around me
Had a virgin skin, but now
Sold in supermarkets now
Studded blankets

Used to hear the cars and the birds, going by
And the people going by, they were my destiny
They were my reason, my purpose in this field
For their plates, their cold bodies, their car seat covers
My soul for your soles of shoes

You may like my taste, you may like my worth
It may say in the bible that you can kill me
But I don't want to die, I don't want to die
You tried to stroke me in a field
Then go home and eat me as your meal",Sick Butchers,1998
Flux of Pink Indians,"Man created greed
A choice of who to feed
A choice to live or die
A choice to smile or cry
A love to give to all
To make, to beg or crawl
A life there and the plans
A pass to say what was
Inventions like the bomb
A device to stop what's wrong
A chance to create a life
Similar to the last
Road to follow straight
Animal to fill the plate
Death, that is so sad
Rituals that are not mad
Like eating what is dead
I thought that made man sad
Obviously not the same
Breed animals to be tame
So man can show the fists
Cause only man exists
Lion eats a man
Man invades its land
Man prods it with a gun
Always proving man has won
Oh, lion eats all but shoes
Big business in the news
Shocks, horrors, families eating
Stuffing all the bleeding meat in

""What a savage, it ate a man""
""I won't feed the lions in the zoo again""

Gracefully luxuriate

My intention bears no fruits of lust
Been to chance I pour my trust
Delicious phases gorgeous touch

Getting close, deeper down
Have you ever tossed at love?
Played the game and tried to touch
To that one showed all your stuff
Moved that you was thinking of
Acting wild and drinking up
Apples we were eating of
Seasons they was fleeting us
And making plans and meeting up

Sentiments of my words ain't been so sincere
The sentiment of my nerves that I just persevere
The big thought of fallin' off disappeared to my fate
They say that Heaven's real
Analyze my demise, I say I'm super anxious
Recognize I deprive this fear and then embrace it
Vandalizing these walls only if they could talk
Conversations don't contemplate to my dark thoughts
Lookin' down on my soul now
Tell me I'm in control now
Tell me I can live long and I can live wrong and I can live right
And I can sing songs and I can unite with you that I love, you that I like
Look at my life and tell me I fight
This that final destination, this that find some information
This that find some inspiration, this that crack, the instillation
This that consciousness sharpening and fist pump and that bomb detonation
Please don't bomb my nation, embalming fluid waiting
I got mind control when I'm here, you gon' hate me when I'm gone
Ain't no blood pumpin' no fear, I got hope inside of my bones

To save her life or take it
The answer no avoided death
And yes would make it
Do you believe in God
Written on the bullet
Say yes to pull the trigger and my sister Cassie pulled it

They didn't love their live so much
As to shrink from death
Inspired in their footsteps
We will march ahead
Don't be shocked that people die
Be surprised you're still alive

All heads are bowed in silent reverence
The floor is wet with tears of sorrowful remembrance
The altar's filled with hearts of repentance
Perfect love kills all fear
Rejoice in this deliverance

Don't think I have the strength tonight
They push me any further
I will find the words to fight

'Cause what they say about me
Cuts deeper than the sharpest knife
And in my head a replay
I'm looking at that red light

I'll drown in the water
If I listen to the sound
Of cruel laughter
I let the stones fall to the ground
They don't know a thing about me
And still the wolves are crying out

And I hear you say, ""I'll take you away""

So will you stand for something
And give them back the ammunition
Or will you let them tell you who you are
My love is deeper than the stars
And you are bigger than the scars that you feel at night
When you're holding your pillow tight
And you're wishing someone would call you Home

Will you shout or will you cry when the fire rains from on high?

She can run but let's teach her
How to walk away now
I'll shake a little if she wants to
Laugh a little if she needs to

She watches the world pass her by like a freight train
And they all call her the same names
Laughing as they point and stare at her

So she cries out to god up in heaven
Been praying since she was eleven
For him to send someone to meet her there

And her hearts is still looking for somewhere to feel alright

When can I move on
Dreading a world that'll never go on
If I took the time replace
Only mine erased
'Cause I feel as if I'm here but I'm gone

(Mr. Doctor)
I heard a lil' tale about to children sittin on the kitchen floor
They eatin mayonaise out the jar and they moms out smokin dope on the stroll
Man, you believe this
Life is complete for them
And it ain't no emotions, only instinct
And that's how they'll be raised by the streets
A boy and a girl
Just up the boulevard from your world
Oh it ain't all gravy where you at
'Cause that's where he gon' go to jack
Catch his first case at, become a disgrace at
But not in this world up the boulevard
I'ma see to hit that liquor, starts so easily
The difference people in my life are dyin and I see this
My question is, to what lengths do we go so that they live
'Cause I'ma reach this
My locc's mean everythang to me, life is an odysea
But sometimes, you don't step up and take the reigns
Man, the world'll play you cheap, should I ride

I'm picturin kids cryin, a head firin up dope over the stove
Family car gettin repot because they couldn't cover the note
Nobody knows what's to eat because there's no groceries
And the baby suffers from a rash 'cause he hasn't been changed in over a week
The oldest keeps things together, by scramblin up some powdered eggs
She's only 5, so why her mom can't keep them pimps from out her face
How could they rape in that arrestin
The mother won't admit, but she's molested, diseased and infested
With wing worms, both of her legs covered with ring burns
She cleans up, but whoever heard of some clean germs
I seen the, hurt in her mama's eyes, she tramatized
Been beat up, ever since her father died, no harmonize

It's hard for me to talk about the good things in my life
With all the things I did for stripes
And the way I made my gramps and my mama cry

Just sell smack to you, and sell crack to you, and sell a sack to you
Never give back to you, unless you know me and you owe me
And never worry about your dreams, that's you the bigga the lil' homie
Here to corrupt you for sho', like my pops did and he did it wrong
Now he lost everything he owned and he lost everyone he knows
Here to corrupt you fo' sho'

Now listen to the sound, break em off a lil somethin
Ain't nuthin poppin but the hood so keep it bumpin
Rollin down the backstreets of East Long Beach, yeah
Atlantic contract flossin with Big Beat
Conversation on the corner with the skirts to put the word in
Here comes M&M and DJ Glaze in a Suburban
Leanin out the side of the ride, what's poppin locc
Lets grab these hoochies, E&J and blaze up the smoke
So we continued on a mission and I'm ready to ride
My kinfolk's on the corner, Twin crawl inside
And take a stroll with the locc, 'cause we goin smoke tonight
So parlay as we slide down MLK
With intentions to be makin a grip, so what is this
Understand the definition, big daddy's a pimp
Blowin smoke with my loccs, headin to the Eastside
So recognize game when you see the G's ride

headed to the front Long Beach eastside

I find myself caught up, more than I expected
but I still take time out to make my rounds
and kick it with the homeys to show I'm still down
'cause I never forget where I been and what we went through
to go to this point of this game that we're into
just 'cause I'm in the spotlight don't mean I've changed
I'm still down to kick it doin everyday thangs
hangin wit the homeys kickin back playin bones
rollin up a fat sack to keep us in the zone
fit to get my drink on fool and reminisce
about the good and bad times we seen ever since
so I'm stayin true to my crew and myself
got the homeys back anytime they need some help
always lookin out for my peeps Glaze and Dubb
and I ain't trippin I'm just showin homey love

ain't it strange, how its the same old thang
Some things never change
ain't it strange, how things just remain the same

Trippin on a memory, do you remember thee
Filipino G from the LBC
as I, continue on a mission trying to make ends meet
kickin trump tight rhymes over bomb ass beats
wait up, I been missin but fool I ain't trippin
when you see me on the streets you know I'm down for the dippin
slippin, hell nah 'cause if you knew what I knew
then you'd probably stay true like I do, believe that
I can't fade it when these hoes want to jock
and actin funny 'cause I'm rollin wit the G in my pocket, drop it
'cause its all about the homeys that was down from day one
tryin to real knowin where ya came from
so chill as I'm goin for mines
while I break it down to you straight line for line
so don't try to re-arrange me
because you know some things never change G

Now some things change but I keep it in focus
I bring it to you real so they label me the Locc
I hope this, brings you to a better understanding
how it came to see as we represent the LB
'cause everyday life, well its a struggle for me
I gots to handle my business and stay down with the homeys
when you're in the rap game
and when you can't kick it, the homeys think you changed
now knowin that I'm only tryin to make a grip
so that I can have thangs, so don't even trip
don't ya know you been down so you considered my Locc
we goin still kick back and blaze up the smoke
and take a G ride when its time to put it work
and grab a few brews and lay low wit the skirts
'cause nevertheless I remain the same
so I'm a keep it real and stay true to the game

I'm back on the road and I ain't gonna stop,
Goin' to roll 'til I'm old, gonna rock 'til I drop.
Out of the smog, headin' into the sun,
I'm goin' to New Orleans, Bourbon Street here I come!

Road fever, wheels turnin' in the rain,
Road fever, fire burnin' in my brain,
Give her the gun, drive like a hurricane.

Got the heat up high, and the radio's on,
Diggin' rock and roll music while we're ridin' along.
Maybe Atlanta, may be Birmingham,
I know where I'm going, God knows where I am!

Standin' by the window, starin' through the rain,
I built my world around her, now I'm on my way again.

'cause she's gone, well she's gone,
Well she's gone, well she's gone.

She's taken all my money - she didn't even leave a dime,
Only one thing to do, stay loaded all the time.

Well she's gone, well she's gone,
Well she's gone, she's gone.

I'm gonna get me some wine,
Get high, forget all my troubles,
You know that girl was so fine,
But she's gone, gone, gone.

{Rod - Solo}

Days passin' slowly, nights they never end,
She's right about the future,
I'm left and now I'm lookin' for a woman and a friend.

She's gone, She's gone,
Well she's gone, she's gone,
Well she's gone, yea, yea she's gone,

See the Golden Arrow go rollin' down the track,

Eyes wide open as I watch that gold machine.

Like a flash of' lightnin', the arrow shinin' gold,

Foghat,"Headed for the station with a pack on my back
I'm tired of transportation in the back of a hack
I love to hear the rhythm of the clickety clack

And hear the lonesome whistle, see the smoke from the stack
I pal around with democratic fellas named Mac
So take me right back to the track, Jack

Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Whoo whoo, whoo whoo ch'boogie
Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack

We reach the destination but alas and alack
We need some conversation to get back in the black
You take a mornin' paper from the top of the stack

And read the situations from the front to the back
The only job that's open needs a man with a knack
So put it right back in the rack, Jack

Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Whoo whoo, whoo whoo ch'boogie
Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack

I'm gonna settle down by the railroad track
And live the life of Riley in a beaten down shack
So when I hear the whistle I can peek through the crack

Watch the train rollin' when it's ballin' the jack
For I just learned the rhythm of the clickety clack
So take me right back to the track, Jack

Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Whoo whoo, whoo whoo ch'boogie

Pushin' a pen and talkin' on the phone.

I thought that my brain would turn to stone.

But I ain't gonna work no more, I've got better things to do, I do,
I need a seven day weekend, spend some time with you, mmm hmm.

They told me if I stayed on for a lifetime,
I'd be an office manager some day.
But my heart was never in the right place,
I only went there for the pay.

But I ain't gonna work no more, I've got better things to do, mmm hmm,
I need a seven day weekend, spend some time with you, Oh yeah.

Well on Friday, the weekend rolls around,
Saturday, I'm gonna rock this town.
On Sunday, won't have to worry no more,
'Cause Monday ain't so bad when there's no work in store.

I guess the money comes in handy,
It helps me pay the bills and rent.
But if I stay too long on this job,
I'll wonder where my time all went.

And now you're stumbling like a jailbird on the run,

Shanghaied at midnight, to some sleazy motel,
The blonde leading the blind, ah, she does it so well!
A view of the highway, four walls and a bed,
She's taking me down now and I'm so easily lead.
She's got me right there where she wants,
Where she can work me all night long.

Motel shaker, shaking the walls, three in the morning and she wants it all.

She puts on her red dress and that's a dangerous sign,
With her first-rate body and her one-track mind.
Heart shakin' like an earthquake, just a little more fun,
When you think it's all over, well she's hardly begun.
She don't care what they can hear next door,
She just wants to get what she came for.

Then left me freezin' on a steel rail rack.

Dad drove a stock car to an early death,
All I remember was a drunk man's breathe.

Ain't livin' long like this,
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?
We know the story how the wheel goes 'round,
Don't let 'em take you to the man downtown,
They got 'em all in the jailhouse baby.
Ain't livin' long like this,
Can't live at all like this, can I baby? Ah take it!

{Erik - Solo}

I live for Angel, she's a road house queen,
Makes Texas Ruby look like Sandra Dee.
I want to love her but I don't know how,
I'm at the bottom of a jailhouse now.

Ain't livin' long like this,
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?
You know the story 'bout the jailhouse rock,
Go on and do it, but just don't get caught.
They got 'em all in the jailhouse baby.
Oh, ain't livin' long like this.
Oh no!

Foghat,"I was movin' up an old dusty road,
I wasn't botherin' nobody, I wasn't botherin' a soul.
I saw a woman's picture on a wanted sign,
She had the face of an angel and the eyes of a child.
So I moved a little closer, just to dig her face,
I wondered why was it hangin' now, in this lonely place?
There was fine threads hangin' beneath her face, like clothes hangin' on a line.
I said watch out man, 'cause this pretty girl is guilty of an awful crime.
She'll take your love, she'll stand you up, she'll make you feel ten feet tall.
She cuts you down, you hit the ground, you and your heart of gold.
They call her the love, the love rustler, yeah.
They call her the love, love, love, love, love, love, love,
Love rustler, ooh yeah.
So I moved on up, on in to town, just to see if this rustler, if she could be found.
Well lo' and behold, to my surprise, she laid a kiss on me, hotter than a brandin' iron.
She came on tough, and she came on strong,
She cowtied my soul, now I can't leave here alone.
And when she told me to buck, I bucked, she told me to moo, I mooed.
When she told to jump, I jumped, she told me to woo, I wooed.
She ran her spurs into my mind, she rode me in to the ground.
If I had the will or strength, I'd crawl on out of town.
They call her the love, love, the love rustler. Oh yeah!
They call her the love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love,
Love rustler, oh yeah!
They call her the love, love, love, love, love, love,love, love,

I'm talkin' 'bout love, yeah! I'm talkin' 'bout love, yeah!.
I'm talkin' 'bout love, ooh, yeah! I'm talkin' 'bout love, ooh, yeah! Alright.
The love rustler! The love rustler!
She runs her spurs into my mind. I just can't leave her behind.
She makes me feel like - ooh! - she makes me feel like ridin' off into the sunset -

Sounds like a real bad case of a girl who needs a guy.

If you need some satisfaction,
And if you need a quick reaction,
If you're tired of bein' lonely,
'Cause I can help you if you only take this heart of mine.

Back in the schoolyard life wasn't so hard, but I couldn't wait to leave.
I left school at sixteen, tired of the routine, money is what I need.
I got into the job line, but there's no work for my kind,
No school tie and no degree, no chance for me.

I found some employment, but still no enjoyment, I worked in a factory.
I picked up my wages, fhe first time in ages, it don't seem enough to me.
The years go by in slow time, became a man in no time,
You came along, the time was right - turned on the light.

Gonna love my life away, I wish I could, (I wish I could)
Girl, you're leadin' me astray, I've been misunderstood (been misunderstood)
Oh oh, I'm in my second childhood, oh oh.

Back on the breadline, seemed like a long time, the waiting was all in vain.
I spent my vacation down at the station, waving to all the trains.
After this deep depression, I shoulda' learned my lesson
I found you in the nick of time, who'll buy the wine?

Gonna love my life away, I wish I could, (I wish I could)

I got a message from a girl in distress,
She was a prisoner in an apartment address.
But like a hero to the scene of the crime,
I lost my way and there was so little time.

Stood at a bus stop on a cold rainy day,
Tire through a puddle, threw some mud in my face.
No bus arrived so I just crawled into town,
I took my chances on the underground.

Subway station, wall to wall people, I couldn't squeeze onto a train.
In desperation, I looked for a taxi, but, oh, the searching was in vain.

Too late the hero, from ten down to zero.
Too late the hero, why did she say, ""Boy, boy you're way too late!""?
She said ""Boy, boy you're way too late!""

I caught a train but there was nowhere to sit,
Reached for a strap, I thought I heard something rip,
There on the Central Line, my pants fell apart.
Train broke down and we were stuck in the dark.

Subway tunnel claustrophobia, best suit, wrinkled and damp,
Finally when I crawled up to her door, she said, ""Goodbye chump!""
Too late the hero, from ten down to zero.
Too late the hero, why did she say, ""Boy, boy you're way too late!""?
She said ""Boy, boy you're way too late!""

Did I see someone in the shadow? Did I hear footsteps on the floor?
Did I hear laughter in the background just before she slammed that door?

{Instrumental}

I turned around and I headed home, I was tired, rejected and cold.
Missed the last train, left around midnight, so I walked that lonesome road.
Too late the hero, from ten down to zero.
Too late the hero, why did she say, ""Boy, boy you're way too late!""?
She said ""Boy, boy you're way too late!""

Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.

Makes me stop before I begin

For the sake of havin' you near

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2009

Le cœur de la ville s'enflamme quand le son entre en jeu
Les préoccupations des frères s'infiltrent dans ton Walkman
L'argent, la boisson, la fumée et les femmes

Je nagerais avec les femmes et un micro dans une piscine
Si j'avais l'occasion de partir loin des vermines
L'hésitation ne se ferait pas, c'est certain
Mes poches sont vides et j'ai faim de pognon et d'un bon destin

J'extirpe ces quelques mots, un stylo de mon paletot
Sorti un jour du caniveau, je roule dans les casinos
Ouais, je fais le zguègue en espadrilles, mais j'assure quand même
Quoi qu'il arrive, car Fonky est la Famille

Autant parler des mains que la bouche chez nous n'est pas louche
Méditerranéen de souche, mes styles font mouche
Au milieu d'embrouilles ou de mauvais coups
Je crame tous les tintanos qui nous cherchent des poux

Dans la nuit, un MC check check le mic
Taquiner la rime et le beat est mon véritable hobby
Envoyer des styles pour tous les frères qui nique la halla
Pour la première fois, le refrain commence comme ça

Tranquille au bar et popo dans le pétard

Porche sombre et gadjos dans les couloirs
(Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys de Marseille!)

Pendant que tu fais un flop, que tu tapes un magnétoscope
Don Choa calcine les rimes comme une clope en garde à vue
Le hip-hop au top descend le long de la rue
Et se saisit du showbiz à son insu

Accepte le son, qui touche de près mes entrailles
Au bercail, ma fonction est le travail
Je me comporte en canaille
Aïe! Les mauvais garçons se collent comme des moucherons
Aux jupons, frappent sans hésiter pour le pognon

Comme les apaches guinchent ton scalp
Ton fric est la proie, des hordes de chiens des Alpes en veulent à tes Delacroix
Mais pas moi, je suis droit, respecte les autres et crois
Au pouvoir de la rime dans la destruction des hazas

L'été, les quartiers, postes dans le bus
Que demander de plus, fusse le funk ou des Vénus?
Gus, soi-disant ma ville pue en plus
Dieu t'a-t-il fait avec un anus au lieu des sinus?

Simple dans ma façon de faire mon sang est rouge clair
Pourtant, j'ai la peau noire et fier de l'avoir
Je cours à la gloire des quartiers avec mes idées
Le produit, sera toujours enragé

Y'a pas que le mauvais côté
Le Rat te le dira, ""la vie est faite pour s'amuser""
Capte le concept des mecs qui s'en battent les couilles
Le bon délire est là, t'inquiète on se débrouille

Mes pensées drivent coolo, coolo
Voilà quelques mots
Pour l'avenir incertain de mes potos
Qui ont quitté les cours tôt
La rage est dans mon âme pour le drame du Front National
J'allume la flamme, la flamme

Fils, comprends ce que tu peux comprendre
Un bon conseil, prétends à ce que tu peux prétendre
Réfléchis un instant avant de faire un pas, tu saisiras
Pourquoi on te lèvera où que tu sois

Avant, je combattais contre des moulins à vent
Maintenant, je fais vibrer les salles et le public en rappant
Satir au soleil, zique à l'oreille
Signe une carte de visite live de Marseille

La balle de ping-pong d'Ali Kong tape
De Marseille à Naples, pour le rap, je capte les étapes
Et cap vers le possee qui me suit

Ici les jours passent, rien ne change vraiment dans les alentours
Coups tentants, mecs partis pour des aller sans retour
Tous attirés, ou presque par le biz, liasses et fesses, sex
Ici et là, ça rafle des tiroirs caisses, quoi
Qu'est-ce que tu veux faire contre ça
A force de faire miroiter, on veut juste ce qu'on voit
Le convoi, là-bas, le brinks alimente mes rêves des dizaines de fois
A croire que ça rapporte plus que le respect de la loi
Les gens honnêtes se crèvent la santé à ONET
L'Etat est le plus grand proxénète, bon biz, propre et net
Faut tenir le coup, se serrer les coudes,
Ne serait-ce que pour nos parents
Question francs, n'attend rien des gouvernants
Putain, qu'est-ce que tu veux que je dise aux gosses en fasse de moi
Qui font plus de thunes en un jour que moi dans le mois
Comment leur dire de retourner au lycée
C'est croix sur les cours, cours pour le fric et les gatsés
Avec le 12 carats, elles tombent dans tes bras
Vas-y, sors le 24 et t'as droit au kamasutra
Quel argument opposer à ces pseudos vies d'idylles ?
Le simple fait d'avoir la conscience tranquille
Ça s'en fout bien pas mal, tant que le cash régale,
Ça croit courir plus vite que les balles si le plan se déroule mal
La morale aujourd'hui, c'est moi qui te la fais
Demain peut-être essayerai-je d'élaborer le plan parfait
La tentation, cherche, tu peux peut-être lutter
L'appel de l'argent, des femmes,
Gazier, essaye au mieux d'y résister
Mes péchés, je crois que je m'en laverai plus tard
Pour l'instant, je fais avec ce que j'ai même si ça me fait chier
J'essaye de lutter et je dis bien, j'essaye

Et les mômes accrochent, le son des canailles mauvais garçon

Ceux qui mixent, ceux qui parlent sur la zique
Et ceux qui taguent sur les fourgons,
C'est un mode de vie, une chose qui nous rend sérieux,
Ami, un besoin unique vécu jour et nuit,
On désire toujours faire mieux, vu que la vie n'est qu'un test,
Et que toutes les situations sont complexes
On pense l'esprit dit fait le, fonce, tant qu'on respire et qu'on est libre,
Y'a qu'à oser, vieux savourer l'existence comme on peut,
L'essentiel est de faire ce qu'on aime et comme on veut,

Mais pas quand y a beaucoup de fric enjeu,

Vu ou ça m'a mené, j'aurai pu me passer d'aller à l'école,

Sur ma vie cette musique constitue encore un des rares trucs qui m'anime,
J'ai pas confiance en l'argent, ça passe d'un compte d'une main,
D'une poche à une autre et fait même s'entretuer les nôtres,
Je ne fais pas confiance aux femmes, ça passe d'un homme à un autre,
De l'arrière d'une caisse, d'un lit à un autre,
Note que dans nos têtes c'est le vrai désordre,
Pour preuve je rappe des trucs qu'on rien à voir les uns avec les autres,
This is a man's world, je m'en rends compte quand je suis au plus mal,
Bien die, ou fucked up, je ne suis pas doué pour le vol ou pour le deal,
Je rappe pour vivre, c'est toujours mieux
Que d'avoir les flics qui me poursuivent,
Je ne fais pas ça pour les femmes, ni avoir trop de fans,
Ni pour voir ces rimes classées profanes,
Gloire à l'art de rue, si tu vivais ce qu'on voit,
Je suis prêt à parier que t'exprimerais les mêmes faits que moi,
On est pas si loin du chaos, nul n'est à l'abri d'être au plus bas,
Penses-y au cas où tu serais amené à fumer ce qu'on fume,
Boire ce qu'on boit, vivre ce qu'on voit, ou livrer ce combat,
Dehors, c'est la guerre, même si tu ne veux pas le croire,
Y'a aussi de l'amour partout même dans mon rap,
Même si tu ne peux pas le voir,
Dédié à nos rues, l'art qui s'en dégage,
Tous ceux qui expriment leur rage et tous nos apaches,
Fonky Family, l'histoire continue, jusqu'au bout dans l'art de rue",Art de Rue,2001
Fonky Family,"C'est pour nos familles
On sait d'où on vient sans savoir où on va
À voir l'état de ces rues et leur évolution
On se demande sincèrement à quand l'émeute, la révolution?
Hé ducon si je pose autant de questions, c'est que j'ai pas les solutions
Que faire quand y'a rien à clé de nos bonnes résolutions
Ça peut plus durer, combien se l'seront juré
Pour finir sous une pierre tombale ou devant les jurés
Dommage qu'il n'y ait pas toujours de récompense à nos efforts
Qu'à la moindre erreur la justice nous fasse payer le prix fort
On fait c'qu'on peut avec c'qu'on a, les moyens du bord
Mais la devise reste sauve c'qui peut encore l'être, femmes et gosses d'abord
J'pleure pas sur mon sort y'a pire que moi
À l'heure où tu m'écoutes au dessus de ta tête t'as peut-être plus d'toit
Mon job n'est pas d'noircir c'tableau
De toute façon c'est pas d'ma faute si la misère d'meure le pire des fléaux
On cherche pas à s'enrichir sur les malheurs des autres
Toutes les vérités sont bonnes à dire et même les nôtres
Au cours d'une vie y'a tout un tas de trucs qui n's'oublient pas
Tel le décès de ton gosse avant qu'il puisse faire ses premiers pas

Notre issue finale seul l'avenir le dira
Dieu seul sait comment ça s'finira ou négociera
Mystère et suspense
Soit en taule, soit en Benz neuve à fonder une famille au top
Ou à laisser une femme veuve et toute une flopée de petits Sat derrière
La vie tient à peu de choses
Cette phrase pourrait être ma dernière
Quand j'quitte mes gars qui t'dit que j'vais les revoir?
J'suis pas à l'abri d'la bavure du mec qui me dit faire son devoir
Et ou d'une fan qui aurait pété les plombs
Voudrait m'buter comme John Lennon, Martin Luther ou Malcolm
Tout n'est qu'incertitude, c'est l'embrouille
Dur de voir clair au milieu de ces turpitudes
Dédié à ceux et celles qui mènent des vies d'chiens ou d'chiennes
J'rapporte la mienne et t'as l'impression que j'raconte la tienne
C'est l'effet FF, des gars plus vrais qu'nature
Ce côté pied sur Terre et à la fois immature
Quand j'plane comme Bob Marley
J'sais plus si c'est moi ou la rue qui est en train d'parler
J'compte plus voir la vie réaliser mes vœux
Mais si j'crève j'aurais vu naître le ""Hors-Série Volume 1"" et ""Si Dieu Veut""
Sur ce avant de dire au r'voir à jamais
J'ai sûrement tout un tas d'trucs à connaître, d'épreuves à surmonter
Peu importe tant que les miens sont à mes côtés
J'ferais peut-être partie de ceux sur qu'il faudra compter

J'vais là où la vie m'mène
Là où mes pieds m'trainent
J'viens d'là où les gens disent tous emmerder l'système
Peu importe la manière forte ou douce
Chacun essaie de survivre conscient qu'on y reste tous
J'vais là où la vie m'mène
Là où mes pieds m'trainent
J'viens d'là où les gens disent tous emmerder l'système
Croire en l'argent, son pouvoir, le respect qu'il dégage
Puiser la force dans l'amour, la haine, la peine ou la rage

Il fallait que je maîtrise les mots pour m'défendre car ce sont des munitions
Si t'as pas les mots t'es baisé, fallait que je brûle mes illusions
Fallait bien que j'les crie aussi c'est ça le drame
On t'écoute quand tu fais du bruit qu'tu casses ou qu'tu pointes une arme
La mienne un Mic, je filme la vie comme Spike
Fume la nuit non stop fallait que j'décompresse nom d'code, Don Cho'
Fallait que j'le dise haut, fallait que j'vise
On avait allumé un feu fallait qu'j'l'attise
Fallait qu'j'ai un but fallait qu'j'fasse mon truc, y'a pas d'magie
Même si j'parle au passé c'est du futur qu'il s'agit
Il fallait pas que je sois trop feignant car je ne suis pas né dans la soie
Fallait qu'j'y crois et pas en me plaignant, mon prénom c'est François
Ne régnant sur rien, fallait bien qu'je parte
Fallait que j'revienne les mains pleines
FF fallait que j'le marque
Fallait qu'on vienne et qu'on démontre à n'importe quel endroit qu'ce soit
Fallait qu'tu viennes à notre rencontre, peu importe quand peut-être ce soir
Fallait qu'on garde espoir c'est tout c'qu'on pouvait faire
Fallait qu'on soit sincères pas dire tout c'qui pouvait plaire
Fallait qu'j'défende mon avis mon corps mon humour
Ma famille mes amis jusqu'à la mort mon amour
Il le fallait et tant mieux s'il le fallait bien
J'reste anxieux ne croyez pas que pour moi tout allait bien
Tapez m'en cinq mais pas dans les yeux si vous me recevez bien

J'vais là où la vie m'mène
Là où mes pieds m'trainent

J'viens d'là où les gens disent tous emmerder l'système
Croire en l'argent, son pouvoir, le respect qu'il dégage
Puiser la force dans l'amour, la haine, la peine ou la rage

Sommes-nous faux ou vrais?
À ton avis, bons ou mauvais?
Demande à ton ami peut-être qu'il nous connaît?
Entre le bien et le mal on navigue
On s'dit que tout est écrit, et qu'c'est la vie quoiqu'il arrive
Le système abîme les nôtres donc la haine les anime
Et c'est normal si tu le ressens lorsqu'on rime
Certains trouvent incompréhensible
Normal, c'n'est pas eux la cible
Au tribunal, c'est jamais leurs noms qu'on cite
Eux n'ont jamais eu besoin de voler pour vivre
Ou connaître le mal-être à cause d'une vie sans équilibre
Ou se droguer pour se sentir libre
Ou se mettre ivre pour oublier le combat qui s'livre
Tout ce que je raconte est minime
Je ne suis ni un caïd, ni un saint, ni accro à la cocaïne
J'suis simple comme mes frères et les tiens sans rire
Et j'sais qu'on nourrit tous le mal et fait la grève de la faim ou bien comme Ali Brahim
J'vais là où la vie m'mène, là où mes pieds m'trainent
J'viens d'là où on emmerde l'système
De là où les rues craignent, de là où la haine imprègne
De là où les gens enfreignent, de là où le bien et le mal règnent

Bref je vois que c'est les mêmes histoires chez les riches et les pauvres
Deal de shit et d'gave et de jeunes qui s'gachent
Dans certains cas c'est un gag, qu'on ait des parents placés ou pas
C'est leur égo qu'on nargue et là y'a plus de blancs et de nègres
Du père smicard à celui qui roule en cabriolet
Ce même dégoût quand c'est ta chair qui vient te cambrioler
Meurt d'une seringue au bras et complètement isolé
Ça m'rend fou d'les voir s’abîmer à en être désolés
On a tous des ambitions différentes
Respectons nos différences
Dans nos rues peu ont les bonnes références
Conséquence, c'est la merde
Et on s'y accommode
On vit sur les nerfs
Et y'a plus rien de commode
C'est les sous qui tiennent les commandes
Pourquoi jouer le voyou quand t'as tout c'que tu demandes
Chez nous y'a pas d'secret le pognon régit tout
Les jeux sont faits et en fin d'course il nous désunit tous

J'vais là où la vie m'mène
Là où mes pieds m'trainent
J'viens d'là où les gens disent tous emmerder l'système
Peu importe la manière forte ou douce
Chacun essaie de survivre conscient qu'on y reste tous
J'vais là où la vie m'mène
Là où mes pieds m'trainent
J'viens d'là où les gens disent tous emmerder l'système

Fonky Family,"Refrain  (x2)

Faut qu'on s'accroche quand la vie nous défie car 
On sera jamais c'qu'on veut être si on fuit car 
De toute façon ici bas rien n’est gratuit 
Faut toujours payer le prix fort 
J'crois que c'est pour ça qu'chaque jour on se bat 
  
Couplet Don Choa
Des vapeurs toxiques, pas de tox sick, que des affamés,
Gonflés à bloc, chiche, enfoiré, do you smoke shit ?
Prêt au choc, seen ? Pour tout cramer, ça finit jamais
Pille le stock, chie sur les porcs qui dorment et rmmmh, pshiiiiiit
Mon armée, kamikaze, marche sur le fil
Opération, ouvre le gaz, crame sur le grill
Explosion dans la chaleur de la nuit, peur sur la ville
Plus de héros, si, Don Cho ! Mais appelle-moi Kahil
Séronégatif à mon dernier test
Strictly hétéro, sans sédatif, mon rap fait taper la sieste
Ou agiter la tête, fou, fais chauffer ta caisse
On veut tous la bouffe dans l’assiette
Chez nous c’est pas tous les jours la fête

Couplet Boss One 
Douze mesures pour dire à ceux que j'aime l'amour que je leur porte 
Dire à ceux qui me détestent, qu'ils courent tous à leur perte 
Qu'on joue tous la même partie avec des dés différents 
Clame ton innocence si entre nous y'a différent 
FF et le troize sur un son de Luch’ c'est ""op"" 
Autant que Saïdou en mission en Bosnie 
Es-tu pret ? 
II faut si peu pour égayer une vie valahé 
Chez nous soit contient que l’honnêteté prime Walahé 
Si les crimes d'amoncelles c'est que plus rien ne se négocie 
Si les bled paumés deviennent dangereux ? C'est qu'ils existent eux aussi 
L'attitude des hommes bougent peu 
Seules les conditions progressent 
La fin on l'a grosse c'est dû à ça que nos rimes agressent 

Couplet Le Rat Luciano
Croire à la beauté du monde ou à la vie en rose
A la longue ça gonfle et à force on est toujours en rogne
C’est rare d’avoir le moral en hausse, même avec des ronds
On en devient morose, cherche les solutions mais tourne en rond
La vie c’est pas que drogue, sexe et pèze
La vie c’est dur mais faut être là sinon c’est toi qu’elle baise
Faut lutter sans trêve, jouer là où d’autres stressent, 
Causer là où d’autres s’taisent, jusqu’à c’qu’on en crève
Les tracas rongent mais pour isoler y’a pas qu’les bringues
Au bout d’ses rêves, pour y aller, y’a pas qu’les blindes
Pour être classe dans cette vie, faut pas qu’les fringues
C’est comme les braquages, pour les faire, faut pas qu’les flingues

Refrain

Couplet Sat
Comment oublier qu’on doit tous mourir, hein ?
Que si tu baisses ta garde, on t’blesse, on t’baise avec le sourire
J’veux bien finir dans l’rôle du plouc ou du sous-fifre
A condition d’avoir une vie intense et de riches souvenirs
J’ai pas trop l’temps d’m’étaler ni de détailler
J’ai douze mesures avant de m’tailler, détaler,
Retrouver ses rues et caler, ses SDF étalés,
Ses histoires propres à nos coins, y’a ses foutues cages d’escalier
Si ces murs parlaient, ils te diraient à quel point l’cadre est sordide, 
Morbide, le Troize et FF c’est du solide
La même équipe, la même famille,
Unis à la vie par l’même péril, à la mort dans l’même périple

Couplet Menzo
C’est pas des paroles qui vont nous faire du mal
Enfoiré tu t’fais du mal, remballe
Tes putains d’critiques à dix balles, j’déballe
Parle de rue, mec, et je me régale
Les moments qu’j’ai vécu, d’ac’, n’ont pas d’égal
Parle pour les Khal’, du Comore jusqu’au Sénégal
Pour nos parents qui s’sont battus pour qu’on ait pas la dalle
J’me dois de pas râler, c’qu’on a fait, il le fallait
C’qu’on raconte c’est c’qui paraît
Qu’on s’le dise, on n’en a rien à carrer
C’est l’Troize, FF, Section Nique Tout, dites-leur : 
« Faut niquer l’bénef’ ! », car chez nous y’a pas d’chef
La vie c’est bref, faut tout niquer avant qu’on crève
Faut tout niquer avant qu’on crève 

Couplet Jo Popo 
Que chaque jour qui s'lève soit béni, 
Chaque parole broie des coeurs, laisse des âmes en furie, 
J'veux sauver ma gueule tant que j'vis, m'en sortir seul. 
Compter sur qui que ce soit, oublie, 
Qu'on fasse tant de bruit, entendent tant de cris, apporter tant de joie, 
Comme ce fameux soir où tu nous as vus pour la première fois. 
Que c'morceau soit en repeat dans ta sono 
Jusqu'à ce qu'elle serre dans le juke box du bar du coin, 
Autant de fois que nécessaire, que ton voisin s'arrache les cheveux 
Parce qu'il sature trop entendre cet air, dis-lui de s'taire, 
Et s'il appelle les HAMS, dis-leur qu'FF et le troize 
Sont aussi dangereux qu'un bon HAH ! 
J'oeuvre pour l'amour de cette musique, 
Qui de tes enceintes résonne dans l'coeur des mômes 
Classé number one

Faut qu'on s'accroche quand la vie nous défie car

Fonky Family,"Chaud comme Marseille, on vous met le feu
Le cœur de la ville s'enflamme quand le son entre en jeu
Les préoccupations des frères s'infiltrent dans ton Walkman
L'argent, la boisson, la fumée et les femmes

Je nagerais avec les femmes et un micro dans une piscine
Si j'avais l'occasion de partir loin des vermines
L'hésitation ne se ferait pas, c'est certain
Mes poches sont vides et j'ai faim de pognon et d'un bon destin

J'extirpe ces quelques mots, un stylo de mon paletot
Sorti un jour du caniveau, je roule dans les casinos
Ouais, je fais le zguègue en espadrilles, mais j'assure quand même
Quoi qu'il arrive, car Fonky est la Famille

Autant parler des mains que la bouche chez nous n'est pas louche
Méditerranéen de souche, mes styles font mouche
Au milieu d'embrouilles ou de mauvais coups
Je crame tous les tintanos qui nous cherchent des poux

Dans la nuit, un MC check check le mic
Taquiner la rime et le beat est mon véritable hobby
Envoyer des styles pour tous les frères qui nique la halla
Pour la première fois, le refrain commence comme ça

Tranquille au bar et popo dans le pétard
(Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys de Marseille!)
Porche sombre et gadjos dans les couloirs
(Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys de Marseille!)
T'as garé ta voiture ici trop tard
(Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys de Marseille!)
Tranquille au bar et popo dans le pétard
(Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys!)

Pendant que tu fais un flop, que tu tapes un magnétoscope
Don Choa calcine les rimes comme une clope en garde à vue
Le hip-hop au top descend le long de la rue
Et se saisit du showbiz à son insu

Accepte le son, qui touche de près mes entrailles
Au bercail, ma fonction est le travail
Je me comporte en canaille
Aïe! Les mauvais garçons se collent comme des moucherons
Aux jupons, frappent sans hésiter pour le pognon

Comme les apaches guinchent ton scalp
Ton fric est la proie, des hordes de chiens des Alpes en veulent à tes Delacroix
Mais pas moi, je suis droit, respecte les autres et crois
Au pouvoir de la rime dans la destruction des hazas

L'été, les quartiers, postes dans le bus
Que demander de plus, fusse le funk ou des Vénus?
Gus, soi-disant ma ville pue en plus
Dieu t'a-t-il fait avec un anus au lieu des sinus?

Simple dans ma façon de faire mon sang est rouge clair
Pourtant, j'ai la peau noire et fier de l'avoir
Je cours à la gloire des quartiers avec mes idées
Le produit, sera toujours enragé

Tranquille au bar et popo dans le pétard
(Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys de Marseille!)
Porche sombre et gadjos dans les couloirs
(Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys de Marseille!)
T'as garé ta voiture ici trop tard
(Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys de Marseille!)
Tranquille au bar et popo dans le pétard
(Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys!)

J'en ai marre de les voir flipper
Y'a pas que le mauvais côté
Le Rat te le dira, ""la vie est faite pour s'amuser""
Capte le concept des mecs qui s'en battent les couilles
Le bon délire est là, t'inquiète on se débrouille

Mes pensées drivent coolo, coolo
Voilà quelques mots
Pour l'avenir incertain de mes potos
Qui ont quitté les cours tôt
La rage est dans mon âme pour le drame du Front National
J'allume la flamme, la flamme

Fils, comprends ce que tu peux comprendre
Un bon conseil, prétends à ce que tu peux prétendre
Réfléchis un instant avant de faire un pas, tu saisiras
Pourquoi on te lèvera où que tu sois

Avant, je combattais contre des moulins à vent
Maintenant, je fais vibrer les salles et le public en rappant
Satir au soleil, zique à l'oreille
Signe une carte de visite live de Marseille

La balle de ping-pong d'Ali Kong tape
De Marseille à Naples, pour le rap, je capte les étapes
Et cap vers le possee qui me suit
J'en suis reconnaissant
À fond voilà pourquoi mes potes sont souvent dans mes chansons

On joue de bonheur ou de peine,
L'amour d'une mère est en soi,
Et personne n'a le pouvoir de tuer.
J'espère que les frères comprennent
Mes histoires extraordinairement humaines.
Dans la vie on a qu'une mère, faut la chérir maintenant,
Certains ne peuvent plus le faire.
Que Dieu t'apporte la force de la satisfaire,
On peut tous mourir n'importe quand,
Chaque seconde compte donc prends plaisir grand !
La plupart du temps les être chers, on les perd,
Que Dieu ait leurs âme, profites, si t'as encore un père,
Nos parents deviennent vieux et ça obsède
Si tu as plus qu'un orphelin vieux !
Penses à lui et à ce que tu possèdes,
Tout le mérite lui revient, il peut juste dire
Qu'il se souvient avant que son cercle familial décède
Ou le laisse, il était bien comme môme.
Depuis il tient le coup,
Ou plutôt il se retient de mettre le feu au monde,
Dédié à tous les gens qu'on aime et qui sont morts.
Si je m'exprime mal, excuse moi,
Mais lorsque le c?ur parle, j'panique, je suis comme toi

REFRAIN :

Faut qu'on soit tous soudés, pour nouer les liens,
Faut qu'on soit tous soudés, pour aller loin,
Faut qu'on soit tous soudés, tous soudés, tous soudés,
Faut qu'on soit, le fait d'être tous soudés.

Là où je vis on est tous soudés, tous soudés.

L'amour entre frères, entre s?urs,
Entre frères et s?urs doit rester une puissance,
Même lorsqu'on se sent seul,
Des êtres unis par le sang peuvent aller loin
Donc élucidez le mystère et renouez les liens.
Pourquoi tant de croix, c'est notre dernière heure,
Pour changer de point de vue, reconnaître l'erreur.
Maman et Papa désiraient fonder une famille soudée,
Soudain ils voient tout s'effondrer.
C'est jamais trop tard, il suffit d'y croire fort,
Auprès des siens on trouve le meilleur réconfort.
Un jour ou l'autre, faudra qu'on parte,
Avant faudra qu'on parle histoire d'établir le contact.
Je suis fils unique vieux !
J'ai qu'un petit cousin que je considère
Comme la prunelle de mes yeux,
Si il a besoin d'aide : ma vie est la sienne,
Qu'il en fasse ce qu'il veut, bref,
Faut que ça revienne comme à l'ancienne

La vie est courte, les délices du bonheur substantiels
La mort frappe l’oiseau assassiné en plein ciel
Le sort collabore à emporter des fois des corps
Le Bad Boy sort quand le coroner s’endort encore
Mourir à trente ans, passer du bon temps
L’angoisse casse l’enfant, fait du frère un type arrogant
Assuré de voir un autre jour sous les coups
Je peux quand même apprécier un coucher de soleil comme vous
Rester lucide si les soucis troublent ma raison
Quand des tours de béton s’érigent à l’horizon
Mais vraiment c’est drôle ; ma philosophie est tel un saule
S’élève vers les cieux, pour replonger plus tard vers le sol
Vision de cauchemar, noir désir du savoir
Voir l’ange déchu, main mise sur le purgatoire
Croire en soi (en soi)
Rien de nouveau sous le soleil

Un sale gosse de plus (yes!) siège à la table des hautes instances
Un accro du micro qui fera mal à ta tête
Prends un Aspro et laisse faire les pros, made in Marseille

Maintenant tu sais que dans ma ville des MC’s déchirent

Fonseca,"Tendré que vender la casa
Porque todo aquel que pasa
Me pregunta por la dueña

La voy a vender barata
Ya que a mí no me hace falta
Porque ya tengo vivienda

Baratísima la vendo y tan solo pienso
Los sacrificios vividos cuánto dolor
Como se marchó esa ingrata sin sentimientos
Dejando marchito el nido de nuestro amor

Todavía me siento joven
Pa' que este golpe tan noble
Me supiera derrotar

Pero Dios cuida a los hombres
Y juro que por mi nombre
Me voy a recuperar

Y tengo que conseguirme una muchacha
Que olvide lo sucedido y me aprenda a amar
Que comprenda que el anillo ya no hace falta
Que no sólo el matrimonio es felicidad

",La Casa,2006
Fonseca,"Nunca supiste qué andaba pensando
Ni mucho menos mirando
Cada cosa que decías
Más de una noche yo estuve soñando
Que tú también me sentías
Que tú también me querías
Es menos fácil teniéndote al lado
Y aunque no lo hayas notado
Haces más fácil mi vida

Como me mira y sin poder tenerla
Como me mira, cuando puedo verla
Como me mira, de reojo y tierna
Como me mira, queriéndo quererla
Como me mira, no hago más que pensar en ti
Como me mira, estando tan cerca

Lástima lo que te quise querer
Peor aunque aunque te quiera
Y que te siga esperando
La otra noche te estuve mirando
Para tenerte grabada
Y que no me duela tanto
Es menos fácil teniéndote al lado
Y aunque no lo hayas notado
Haces más fácil mi vida

Como me mira
Como me mira, cuando me mira
Y aunque me mires no sabrás que está pasando
Como me mira, cuando me mira
Como me mira, cuando es noche y mira abajo
Mirándote yo he pasado noches que no sabrás
Mirándote he pasado más de mil noches que nunca sabrás
No juegues más con candela me enseñó mi mamá
Mirándote porque este amor que me guardo
Queriéndote es sólo mío y no más
Cantándote no aguanto una noche más
Noches que no sabrás
Mirándote yo he pasado noches que no sabrás
Al otro lado del río y yo me vine a sentar
No juegues más con candela me enseñó mi mamá
Mirándote porque este amor que me guardo
Queriéndote es sólo mío y no más
Cantándote no aguanto una noche más
Noches que no sabrás",Como Me Mira,2006

cuando se quiere de verdad
no existe duda, no existe rencor
solo un corazon, que es para los dos

no hay ni calma, ni pasion

soñando, contigo, queriendo
que se cumpla nuestro idilio!!

y asi muy juntos volver a sentir
que se funda tu alma y la mia
en una sola razón
un idilio de amor!!

Fonseca,"Una lagartija azul se me metió en la bañera
Azul sólo era su cola de ahí pa' arriba era negra
Juliana siempre me ha dicho que se llaman julianitas
Ojitos de casta fina les decía la niña Alicia
Recuerdos que no se olvidan, colores que me fascinan
Hombre que suerte la mía, poder tener esta vida

Ay mi lagartija que come araña, corre por la casa
La salamanqueja que la acompaña, trepa la pitaya
Mi vieja vecina que las cuidaba, yo que las buscaba
Y si por los techos no caminaban, ay las añoraba

Como les venía diciendo estaba yo hipnotizado
Que vengan de cola azul eso si es un invento raro
Juliana siempre me dijo que mire al techo y al piso
Por cada lobito visto es un deseo concedido

Me acuerdo que mi vecina, armaba una algarabía
Deja la salamanqueja, que de pronto se nos vuela
Recuerdos que no se olvidan, colores que me fascinan
Hombre que suerte la mía, poder tener esta vida

Ay mi lagartija que come araña
Que sigan que busquen adentro
E' mi casa que sigan que busquen
Lo que hay es parranda

Ay mi lagartija que come araña corre por la casa
La salamanqueja que la acompaña trepa las pitayas
Mi vieja vecina que las cuidaba y yo que las buscaba
Y si por los techos no caminaban ay las añoraba

Ay mi lagartija que come araña corre por la casa

Sólo seguir con mi vida sin tanto remordimiento

Y si no llega
Cuándo va a empezar

Scattered on the hill

Was said and done

I lay there in the dark
And I close my eyes
You saved me the day
You came alive

Still I tried to find my way
Spinning now was end of days
Burning like a flame
Behind my eyes

Drown it out
Drink it in
Crown the king of suffering
Prisoner, slave to the disguise

Disappear the only thing
Bittersweet surrendering
Knew that it was time
To say goodbye

I lay there in the dark
And I close my eyes
You saved me the day
You came alive
No reason left
Me to survive
You saved me
The day you came alive

I can finally live
Come alive

Open my eyes
You saved me

One flag was taken down
To raise another in its place

A heavy cross you bear
A stubborn heart remains unchanged
No harm, no life, no love
No stranger singin' in your name

But maybe the season
The colors change in the valley skies
Dear God, I've sealed my fate
Runnin' through hell, heaven can wait

Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight

Let's say we take this town
No king or queen of any state
Get up to shut it down
Open the streets and raise the gates

I know a wall to scale
I know a field without a name
Head on without a care
Before it's way too late

Maybe the season
The colors change in the valley skies
Oh God, I've sealed my fate
Runnin' through hell, heaven can wait

Forever gone without a trace
Your horizon takes its shape
No turnin' back, don't turn that page

Come now, I'm leavin' here tonight
Come now, let's leave it all behind

You don't have to wear it, take it off. 
Look up now, and don't pretend. 
In the limelight you could take another bow, 
Would anybody see you? 
You can run around in circles. You could chain yourself, 
Would anybody be there to release you? 
Don't speak now, and don't turn around. 

When the moon kisses town 
And all the elfs are coming over, 
No more lies and no disguise anymore. 
Shame's just a word and nothing further. 
Do not turn around,
When the moon kisses town.

Move along now, do not look behind, 
There's nothing to forget, let it lie. 
Move on now, and don't turn around. 

When the moon kisses town 
And all the elfs are coming over, 
No more lies and no disguise anymore. 
Shame's just a word and nothing further. 
Do not turn around,
When the moon kisses town.

Look up now, there's no need to be ashamed, 
You don't have to wear it, take it off. 
Look up now, while the world calms down.

And the moon kisses town 
And all the elfs are coming over, 
No more lies and no disguise anymore, anymore anymore.
You can take away the cover,
You can take away the cover, now.
Look up now, look up now,
See the world calm down,
When the moon kisses town.",When the Moon Kisses Town,1997
Fool's Garden,"The waitress is cleaning the bar 
It's two in the morning.
She offers some coffee to me, 
Turns the radio on.
The caster is selling 
His voice to the night, 
The coffee gets cold in a while.

The old man beside me is gone, 
He showed me a blueprint 
Of a house he would build 
With the money he never could save. 
His father is buried down by the sea 
Once he was younger than me. 

Why am I sad today?
Why am I on the way 
Down to the border
Not over the line?

Why am I sad today?
Why am I on the way 
Down to the limit of time? 
I'm sleepless tonight. 

Take me away from the gloom, 
I'm cold from the inside. 
The waitress has turned off the lights, 
There's nothing to fear. 
She's put on her coat and once in a while 
The lines on her face disappear.

Why am I sad today?
Why am I on the way 
Down to the border 
Not over the line?

Why am I sad today?
Why am I on the way 
Down to the limit of time? 

Oceans awake and walls break down 
When you are there. Oh.
You take my hand 
And you just lead me right out of here. Oh yeah.

Fool's Garden,"Mother's waiting in the kitchen, 
The elephant's waiting in the zoo, 
The teacher's waiting in the classroom 
And I am waiting here for you. 
And the audience is waiting 
For the show that won't begin. 
The artist's waiting at the backdoor, 
Because nobody let him in. No no.

She said there's no tomorrow. 
How did she know? 
Did anybody tell her? 
I can't explain, 
I'm sitting in the corner, 
Staring at the wall

It's time you started 
To think seriously about 
Your future and your dreaming, yeah.
She said and didn't leave no room for doubt, 
That if I took her meaning, 
There was no longer dreaming, 
It's just a perfect screaming.

Oh my God.

Fool's Garden,"I'm sitting here in the boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wasting my time
I got nothing to do
I'm hanging around
I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder

I'm driving around in my car
I'm driving too fast
I'm driving too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely
I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder

I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon-tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
And all that I can see is just another lemon-tree

I'm sitting here
I miss the power
I'd like to go out taking a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired
Put myself into bed
While nothing ever happens and I wonder

Isolation is not good for me
Isolation I don't want to sit on the lemon-tree

I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
And everything will happen and you wonder

Fool's Garden,"The devil was my saviour,
The only one to blame it's me
Though I've forsaken you,
The fire's still the same.

I didn't mean to hurt you,
Deceived you, now I fall.
I never meant to break you,
To make you feel so small.

...Never go away...Forgive me...
Forgive me... Forgive me!
...Never go away...Forgive me...
Forgive me... Forgive me!

All the lies have driven you
Away and now I am
The one to be forsaken too
Afraid that I can't stand
The rain no longer -
Stay and get over all your pride
Because I've never needed you
More than I need you tonight.

Never go and save me!
In a minute it's too late.
Hold me now don't let me fall.
Why don't you save me?
There's no limit on my way
That takes me down,
I beg you - call! -
To call my name again!

Deliver me from evil
Save me from the past.
I'll never lose my
Faith in you,
My love will ever last.

A prison made of failure
Your forgiveness is the key,
I never meant to break you,
You're my saviour - set me free!

...Never go away...Forgive me...
Forgive me... Forgive me!
...Never go away...Forgive me!
Forgive me... Forgive me!

Never go and save me!
In a minute it's too late.
Don't let me run against the wall.
Why don't you save me?
There's no limit on my way
That takes me down,
I beg you - call! -
To call my name again!

Never go and save me!
In a minute it's too late.
Don't let me run against the wall.
Why don't you save me?
There's no limit on my way,
I beg you to call my name again!

All the lies have driven you
Away and now I fall.
The one who's been forsaken too
It's me, I cannot call.",Save Me,2000
