Disciple,"Just a taste and your eyes will be opened
Gonna see everything like a God tonight
You keep saying this over and over
We're no longer slaves that you victimize

We came here to fight

We won't just lay our weapons down
To your demands
We won't be swayed so easily
Thrown by your wind
These battle lines were drawn since the beginning
Nothing left to decide
There's nothing left to decide

Even if His hand doesn't save us
We will never bow our face tonight
Since the second Adam has rescued
We'll be looking to raise up when we die",Battle Lines,2010
Disciple,"The calm that comes before this rage
Love that conquers all this hate
The sweating hands that hold on tight
Far too late to stop this slide

Strip this away if it's what it takes
I'm ready to break

Lean forward
I'm bracing for collision
Run faster
I'm chasing Your collision

Shattered pieces in my eyes
Sweet comfort has passed me by
Wings no longer spread in flight
Far too late to stop this dive

I'm not running away
I'm not running away
I'm chasing, I'm chasing You",Collision,2010
Disciple,"On a road to nowhere
Tried to find myself there
I went as far as I could go
From everything I know

Now I'm emptied up and used
Broken and abused
But I still hear You

Every time I run away
I hear Your voice inside of me
It's deafening
Can't fight it, can't fight it

Calling me to come back home
To the only place where I belong
It's deafening
Can't fight it, can't fight it

I can still hear you say
You will never escape
How far my love can reach
And I need you to believe

Now there's nothing left to lose
And hope is breaking through
And I still hear You

You're never too far away
And it's never too late",Deafening,2010
Disciple,"Dear pain, oh, it's been a long time
Remember when you were holding me tied
I would stay awake with you all night
Dear shame, I was safe in your arms
You were there when it all fell apart
I would get so lost in your beautiful eyes

I let you go
But you're still chasing

Go ahead, you're never gonna take me
You can bend, but you're never gonna break me
I was yours, I'm not yours anymore
Oh, you don't own me

Dear hate, I know you're not far
You would wait at the door of my heart
I was amazed at the passion in your cries
Dear anger, you make me so high
You were faithful to show up on time
Such a flame that was burning in your eyes

I let you go
But you're still chasing

Go ahead, you're never gonna take me
You can bend, but you're never gonna break me
I was yours, I'm not yours anymore
Oh, you don't own me
Go ahead, put a target on my forehead
You can fire, but you got no bullets
I was yours, I'm not yours anymore
Oh, you don't own me

It's tempting me to look back
But everything that we had together was a lie

Go ahead, you're never gonna take me
You can bend, but you're never gonna break me
I was yours, I'm not yours anymore
Oh, you don't own me
Go ahead, put a target on my forehead
You can fire, but you got no bullets
I was yours, I'm not yours anymore
Oh, you don't own me","Dear X, You Don't Own Me",2010
Disciple,"All that is behind me, this mess of life
Where out of nothing came a beautiful design
Know that I've had but a taste of a deathless wine 
So I give up the flame to the hands beside
And I'll be waiting

Where the desert is covered in roses
Where I can outshine the stars in a single day 
The face of God isn't hidden 
When I wake into eternity 

Where the shadows are never discovered 
Tears are nothing more than a memory 
Death isn't alive any longer 
When I wake into eternity

Now I know I see it in your eyes
You knew at some point that we'd have to say goodbye 
I looked for this moment for all my life
To be caught away in the arms of God 
And I'll be waiting

When I awake I'll see Your face
When I awake I'll see Your face [Revelation 22:4]",Eternity,2010
Disciple,"You've got my attention
There's no need to hurt your self this way
You think no one will notice you're feeling
When you cry yourself to sleep

You feel stuck on the outside looking inside
Wishing this life wasn't your life
And you think you're damaged way beyond repair
Well you're not so far that I can't get to where you are

You wish you were someone else
Every night you fall to pieces
Knowing you can't save yourself
I can see you, I can hear you
There's a place where the broken go
There's a room full of second chances
You're not stranded on your own
You're not invisible

I'm ready to listen
There's no need to hold it all inside
The smallest whisper
I hear it when your strength has all but died

I need you to believe me, can you trust me
That what you see, is not what I see
The reflection in the mirror's telling lies
Cause nothing you have done could change how much I love you

You're not invisible
I can see you as you're falling on your knees
You're not invisible to Me",Invisible,2010
Disciple,"I see the world in black and gray
Broken dreams of a runaway
Escape the world to medicate
Symptoms gone but disease remains

If the vision dies will it ever breathe again

Oh, I've got to let go of the illusion
This is the end of me, You are my remedy
Oh, it's taking its toll - this pollution
This is the end of me, You are my remedy
Where you stop is where you'll start again

I hold the weight of sorrow deep
Wide awake but my mind's asleep
Familiar needle scratches on my skin
Like a record warped with ill content

I've got to let go of all of this
It's the end of me, my remedy",Remedy,2010
Disciple,"Can you feel it?
Our anthem is rising 
The voices are screaming
The minds are awakening 

And our march is shaking the ground
And now we're running to tear these idols down 
Send the flares, revolution's coming now 

The tide has broken out
Flooding till they all fall down
Revolution's coming now
The blood spilled on the ground
Will cry until they all fall down 
Revolution's coming now

And now the children take up their arms
And lead us in the charge of enlightenment
A mass exodus of fear leaving hearts
To the place where we will tear these idols down
Send the flares, revolution's coming now",Revolution: Now,2010
Disciple,"With my bloody fists raised to the sky

I've swallowed all your lies
That the time of my expiration's drawing nigh
Breaking ties tonight
You can see it in these eyes
I will not let you dictate how I live and how I die
The more things you sow the more things I burn

Never will you see me fall to you
I'm rising with my bloody fists raised to sky 

You can't stop this fire now
You can't blow it out
Everything will change
Here comes the shot heard round the world
You can't slow this fire down
You can't take it out
Everything will change
Here comes the shot,
This is the shot heard round the world 

I embrace the sight of pain
These medicines are just poisons by another name
And if it's time to play the game
Then let's border on insane
As I recklessly abandon all attachments to me
I touch the sun while you touch the rain

Where is the sting?
Where are the fangs that haunted me?
Where is the sting?",Shot Heard 'Round the World,2010
Disciple,"Infiltrated crawling on the inside 
Crooked hands put us all in their chains 
Wrapping nooses all around the halos 
Another chemical making my blood insane 

We're so sick of feeling helpless 
We've been running this wheel to death
We're not a mark upon your checklist 
You're gonna feel it kicking in your chest

We've waited far too long
Incinerate this

To all the anarchy inside we can't escape
Set it off let it all burn down
To all the hell inside that's been controlling me
Set it off, set it off, watch it all burn down

Intoxicated drinking all your poison 
Your flattery's got us eating crumbs off your hands 
It's gotten far beyond reckless
You're gonna see it going up in flames",Watch It Burn,2010
Disciple,"The light at the end has faded away
One terror after another
Somewhere in the fire
The embers of faith
Will burn through tomorrow
You're breathing

It's worth the pain
God's in the rain
It's not too late to start again
It's worth the pain
So hold on tonight

Your passionate eyes try to explain
All the blindness you're feeling
The six feet of lies exposed in His fire
Resurrecting your sunrise
You're breathing

There's grace
When you're at your wit's end
Begging for it
He'll take you by the hand
There's grace",Worth the Pain,2010
Disciple,"Our faces were forgotten, the unrecognizable
It's a mystery in this paradox
In a time we were abandoned to a maze of miserable
But that time has been forever lost
We have been reborn

We were the bruised
We were the broken
We don't live in pieces anymore
We have won
We have overcome
Our scars have been made beautiful
We're the redeemed
This is who we are

Our afflictions overtaken
By the inexplicable
With a grace that takes the place of chains
Crimson cascading over the most unforgivable
Stealing all our sins away
We have been reborn

We were the bruised
We were the broken
We don't live in pieces anymore
We have won
We have overcome
Our scars have been made beautiful
We're the redeemed
This is who we are

We are rising above this gravity
We have been reborn

We were the bruised
We were the broken
We don't live in pieces anymore
We have won
We have overcome
Our scars have been made beautiful
We're the redeemed
This is who we are",Beautiful Scars,2012
Disciple,"Another crash, another fall, another failure
Another choice I don't want to remember
Been here too many times
Every day's another fight
I'm at war with the person I could be
Give me a chance and I'll mess up a good thing
But this is where it ends
Yeah, this is where it ends

This is where I draw the line
This is the where the old me dies
Light a match, let it burn, kiss it goodbye,
Giving up what I was
This is where I draw the line

Another battle I've lost fighting solo
How many times must I learn what I already know?
Can't do this on my own
I wasn't meant to fight alone
So I'm lifting my hands in surrender
Take my faults and my flaws, make me better
Cause this is where I end
Right where You begin

This is where I draw the line
This is the where the old me dies
Light a match, let it burn, kiss it goodbye,
Giving up what I was
This is where I draw the line

Set me on Fire
Set me on Fire

Burn me up, burn me up, burn me all the way,
Till there's nothing left but You
Burn me up, burn me up, burn me all the way,
Till there's nothing left but You

Set me on Fire

This is where I draw the line
This is the where the old me dies
Light a match, let it burn, kiss it goodbye,
Giving up what I was
This is where I draw the line

Disciple,"We are the products of hate
We are the ones that you blame
Attention is the poison you crave
We are the ones on the edge
We are the ones on the end
Now we're the ones that are taking over

You try to fit this circle in your square but
I'm living outside legalistic handcuffs
You try to tell me that I'm never gonna be enough
That's where you're wrong
And it's driving you mad that I'm free 

Lie if you want in your bed of hate
We're not your slaves
We are the kings with a King
Lie if you want in your bed of hate
We're not your slaves
We are the kings with a King

You can build your own cage
You can dig your own grave
You can wear your own chains",Kings,2012
Disciple,"I’ve had a bad three days
Coming off of a bad three years
I’ve had nothing but time
For me to think about how
Things aren’t always as they appear
You know the sun will always shine

With every dream that I chase
Watch it all be erased
And just like trying to capture the wind
In the hole we find ourselves in
And it’s sinking

Misguided
Divided
We have nowhere left to fall
O GOD SAVE US ALL
Mistaken
Forsaken
With our backs against the wall
O GOD SAVE US ALL

I’ve been asleep forty days
Been awake forty long nights
My life is stuck in rewind
If I don’t think about
These trials just disappear
My apathy turns out just fine

I’m on a road of regret
The pain I’d like to forget
Like somebody left the record
Stuck on repeat
So that just when you think it’s over
It keeps screaming

Misguided
Divided
We have nowhere left to fall
O GOD SAVE US ALL
Mistaken
Forsaken
With our backs against the wall

Disciple,"All alone
In a place I can't remember
Lost control
Forgot what I was chasing after
The lies I've tried to justify
Have kept me up at night
I'm done trying to hide my lies
Away from Mercy's eyes

Every little secret that I kept there
Locked inside my heart
Every single regret, every misstep
That kept me in the dark
But now I stand face to face
With the light of Your Grace
And all the weight of all my shame begins to fall
Once and for all
Once and for all

This is a war,
I'm done with getting over
The weight is more
Then I was ever meant to shoulder
Only You can save this life
So I come clean tonight

Locked inside my heart
Every single regret, every misstep
That kept me in the dark

And all the weight of all my shame begins to fall
Once and for all

Once and for all

Someday, the grave and death will lose their stay
There will be no more tears and no more shame

Someday we will call this home
Someday death will lose its hold

Disclosure,"There are voices in my head
And my heart is heart is trying hard to drown them out
I keep hearing what they say
They can space me into what they're all about

Well power slips away
And I'm weakening with every word they say
So I contemplate my faith
As I do, the whisper turns into a shout

You bring out the voices inside of me
Can't stop from a place that I can't reach
I would love to practice what I preach
You bring out the voices inside of me

I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me
I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me

Risking everything I had
I was keen to find the worst that I could do
Throw this sanity away
Brought destruction to the people that I know

My hurt became a cage
I became a puppet on the stage
And even though we're not okay
The feeling brings me blush all the same, all the same

You bring out the voices inside of me
Can't stop from a place that I can't reach
I would love to practice what I preach
You bring out the voices inside of me

Your step missing, time's ticking, ain't got a clue
Something I said, the way that I move
Strong passion, hot passion, too much for you
Don't complicate this, simple to me
I've got it, you want it, but it might not come free

I'm just here, to tell the world, how my story went
You see, first it was a dream, I was livin' in Rome
And then I moved to London, bought a brand new home
And everywhere I went, I drew lots of attention
Like a stretch limousine, one of those new inventions
It took a few years 'fore the day had come
But I was ruler of the WORLD ranked number one
So I headed towards Washington to claim the crown
Let the whole world know that, the King was in town
As I, arrived, the crowd started to cheer
And then someone yelled out, ""The King is here!""
So I headed toward stage, to make a speech
about the new style of living I was gonna teach, uh-huh

If I ruled the world
Huh-huh, huh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
I'd love all the girls, I love 'em love 'em baby!
Black diamonds and pearls, ooh yeah yeah
If I ruled the world

People started flowin' as they reached for my hand
I said, ""Thank you for bringin' me to the Promised Land
But now I must go, say goodbye to everybody
Tonight I'll see you all at my Super Dinner Party""
And late that night, at my Super Dinner Party
I was dancin' to the beat and entertainin' La-Di-Da-Di
The music started endin', it was time for a speech
The crowd started sittin' as I rose from my feet
And this was once a dream, I explained to the crowd
But now, I rule the world, and I feel, so very proud
Excuse me please, for stoppin' this show
I just had to thank you all, huh, and me so
My first day in office, the King on the throne
I spent my first three hours on the telephone
You know with newsmen reporters, and votes too
I had so many calls, I didn't know what to do
You know out that office I continued to work
I signed so many papers, my fingers started to hurt
Then I shook off the pain, say this ain't no thing
'Cause there's nothin' in the world like bein' number one king!

If I ruled the world
Huh huh huh huh, huh-huh huh-huh
I'd love all the girls, I love 'em love 'em baby!
Black diamonds and pearls, ooh yeah yeah
If I ruled the world, whoa yeah
If I ruled the world

Now I rule the world and now, I'm on top
And I'm rollin' with folks that could never be stopped
And I'm here to let you know this is where I belong
And to you sucker emcees that sing my song
And it's a song that's strong about right and wrong
And I'm rock it to you baby baby all night long
And it's a song about love, and happiness
In a world of peace, and you know that's fresh
Now I'm the king, and I want you to know
That I'm the Master Blaster Rapper who's runnin' the show

And to all of you rappers in every country
You better stop what you're doin', and listen to me
'Cause we gotta stop war, and use unity
To fight crime and hunger and poverty
'Cause the African baby is dyin' overseas
While you sucker mission politicians bustin' out Z's
Huh, twenty million people all unemployed
While the rich man try to play Pretty Boy Floyd
While the working class just struggles hard
Try to make ends meet against all odds
While the poor man can't even deal with life
You know he tried to escape, and smoked the coke on the pipe

And it's time for a change, to a better way
'Cause the sun has gotta shine through the cloudy day
So listen up world, while I teach this class
And take heed to the message or we ain't gonna last
'Cause I know, the solution, is the contribution
Of woman and man to just join the revolution
That'll take your brain to a higher plane
And help you deal in a world that's gone insane
With the problems that I know we can stop
From the ruler of the world and the man on top
But the years went by, and time was up
And the ruler of the world had ran out of luck
And all the people at the time who said they were my friends
Didn't know me when my job had come to an end
They came up to my face, as happy as can be
He was running his mouth like, Muhammad Ali
So I shook his hand calmly as I headed to the door
On my way to the ghetto to treat once more

If I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls, I love 'em love 'em baby!
Black diamonds and pearls, ooh yeah yeah
If I ruled the world, yeah
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls, I'd love 'em love 'em baby!

Disco Inferno,"Drifting further out to sea,
The strength will soon be leaving me.
Our ships have sunk or run aground,
And only sharks now swim around.
Smashed and battered by the waves,
Support their hope of being saved.
And every passing ship to chance,
Salvation in a passing glance.

I may need dreams from time to time,
But dreams aren't keeping me alive.
My dreams have torn my life in two--
Now I just need a rock to cling to.

I'm often closer than I think,
Yet my grip is far too weak.
I grab a box and swim away,
Time and time and time again.
But not for me this time I guess
And then the next and then the next.
Is my fear of crashing waves
Greater than my fear of being saved?

I may need dreams from time to time,
But dreams aren't keeping me alive.
My dreams have torn my life in two
Now I just need a rock to cling to.",From the Devil to the Deep Blue Sky,1993
Disco Inferno,"I caught a dawn chorus this morning,
And it was a show-stopper.
I'm rising early again, and it's great.
I took a Hell of a chance,
And it's paid off handsomely.
Now it looks like everything is right.

And the sky was deep blue, and the air was ice-cold.
I look at the sky quite a lot,
Don't you know?

'Cause I don't know what the future's got in store for me,
But it's gotta hold more than the past any day.

Now I don't care if the past has left marks on me
Who can't assess their own damage with their own two eyes?
God knows how we did it,
I guess we're all just scrabbling around in the dirt
We just aim for the sky.

There's so much pessimism around that it's frightening
Makes you wonder where it's all gonna end.
But if you get up real early--say 4:30--and look around,
You'll see the world before the cynics have got out of bed.",The Atheist's Burden,1994
Disco Machine,"I used to go out to parties and stand around; 
'cause I was too nervous to really get down.

I have got myself together, baby,

When I hear that wind and I think of Spring
Underneath an open window a carved out sign and
often I would fight with my mind

When you washed your eyes in last night's tea
I thought you might come out from the dream to find that

Oh the queen had come and the King had died
and my forehead burned but I closed my eyes

to the market cove where I could
find six seeds to bring back to the yard

Curtain was rising

Not recognizing

Is this one play, is this one song?
What is my part, do I do wrong?

Des compagnons de nuit dignes des compagnons de peine

Personne comprend rien parce que personne vit dans ton crâne
Mais y'a toujours quelqu'un pour te dire, ""Non, pas comme ça""
Tu contrôles plus rien, t'es à fond dans l'Nhar Sheitan
Y'a toujours un engraineur pour te dire, ""Viens, on fait ça""
Tu t'dégrades de jour en jour et de nuit blanche en nuit blanche
Tu crois plus en l'amour, ton seul langage, c'est la violence
Personne ne le sait, mais y'a des raisons à tout ça
Et c'est trop lourd à porter, pourtant, tu le garderas pour toi

Weed, oseille, fille, bouteille
Stress, ego, haine, problème

T'en as plein le crâne
Et c'est trop dur à porter
T'en as plein le crâne
Et c'est trop dur de lutter
Donc, demain, j'arrête, ouais, c'est ça, j'arrête
Donc, demain, j'arrête, enfin, j'arrête peut-être
Donc, demain, j'arrête, ouais, c'est ça, j'arrête
C'est sûr, demain, j'arrête, enfin, j'arrête peut-être

Tu veux juste te remplir, et peu importe avec quoi
Chasser ces mauvais souvenirs juste en claquant des doigts
Ce soir, comme hier soir, tu céderas à tes démons
Tu détestes les problèmes, mais encore plus les solutions
Tu t'dégrades de jour en jour et de nuit blanche en nuit blanche
Tu crois plus en l'amour, ton seul langage, c'est la violence
Personne ne le sait, mais y'a des raisons à tout ça
Comme c'est trop lourd à porter, comme d'hab', tu le garderas pour toi

Weed, oseille, fille, bouteille
Stress, ego, haine, problème

T'en as plein le crâne
Et c'est trop dur à porter
T'en as plein le crâne
Et c'est trop dur de lutter
Donc, demain, j'arrête, ouais, c'est ça, j'arrête
Donc, demain, j'arrête, enfin, j'arrête peut-être
Donc, demain, j'arrête, ouais, c'est ça, j'arrête
C'est sûr, demain, j'arrête, enfin, j'arrête peut-être

D'un revers de la main, un jour, j'ai tout balayé
J'ai appelé les miens, les vrais, j'leur ai dit qu'j'l'ai aimais
J'ai dit, ""Fuck"" à tous mes ennemis, j'ai affronté mes problèmes
L'ego et le déni en tête de mon top ten
La fierté et la honte sont des sœurs jumelles
L'une t'éblouit, l'autre te fait d'l'ombre, coincé dans un tunnel
Pendant que Miss Désillusion dans des bouteilles en verre
Te fournit des munitions pour tirer sur tes rêves
Et tu tires sur des joints jusqu'à assombrir le ciel
Juste le temps d'un son, fuck les problèmes

T'en as plein le crâne
Et c'est trop dur à porter
T'en as plein le crâne
Et c'est trop dur de lutter
Donc, demain, j'arrête, ouais, c'est ça, j'arrête
Donc, demain, j'arrête, enfin, j'arrête peut-être
Donc, demain, j'arrête, ouais, c'est ça, j'arrête
C'est sûr, demain, j'arrête, enfin, j'arrête peut-être",Fuck Les Problèmes,2014

On a frôlé la mort, frôlé l'amour
Tu connais mes remords, hein, mon amour?
'Tain, j'ai le mord pour nous, mon amour
Je t'aime à mort, à vie, mon amour
On a faillit s'aimer, faillit se détester
Nos cœurs comme des montgolfières, fallait les délester
Mais retour en arrière sous un soleil d'été
Les mains jointes, nos âmes se disent ""Namaste""
Et les pupilles amoureuses comme sous LSD
On s'aime le L, les MM, le J et le VSD
Mais, un jour, quelle idée, j'ai fait le canidé
J'ai égaré ma carte de fidélité
Avide comme un ado, les bourses pleines (les poches vides)
Le phone sonne, les gos s'plaignent en scred (j'raccroche vite)

J'me croyais infaillible, mais j'ai des failles graves
Retour en arrière sous une pluie d'été
Mon âme cherchait la tienne pour dire ""Namaste""
Mais, ton cœur méfiant, celui qu'j'ai dévasté
Maintenant, surveillera tout, comme la DST
Et Dieu sait comment j'me suis détesté
Vaniteux dans ma bonté, lâche dans ma méchanceté
Les âmes chancelantes, le démon riait lentement
Trahison tranchante, faudra plus qu'un pansement
Des peurs funestes, des promesses célestes
Quand le diable de nos cœurs faisait son festin
Mais les anges, en guest, ont rejoint la fête
Toi et moi, les mains jointes, portons le destin

Prends le risque, prends le risque d'aimer
Parce que tout ce qu'ils t'disent, c'est de n'jamais t'aimer

Frites, merguez, c'est la fête du quartier

Prends le risque, prends le risque d'aimer
Tout ce qu'ils t'disent, c'est de n'jamais t'aimer
Depuis qu't'es petit, on n'a fait qu'te nier
Prends mon disque comme un bouclier

Parce que, chez moi, ""aimer"" est un gros mot
Les sentiments, c'est réservé aux homos
Dire ""je t'aime"", c'est un peu comme une insulte
C'est plus facile et courant de dire ""fils de pute""
Faut gonfler les pecs, jamais baisser sa garde
Tu tiens l'regard, tu fais le mec, on va sortir les armes
Poisson rouge, cicatrisé à vie
Nous, nos embrouilles, c'était pas pour des disques

Depuis qu't'es petit, on n'a fait qu'te nier
Donc prends mon disque comme un bouclier

Peu importe, on est des parias
C'est pour les fils aînés, les chars d'assaut
Qui baissent ni les bras ni le pantalon
Qu'évitent les keufs et leurs lassos
Quand ils s'empressent de nous foutre à l'ombre
Donc on doit s'aimer
Putain d'merde, c'est la solution
Si un frère gagne, qu'il est champion
S'il est champion, on est champion

Donc prends le risque, prends le risque d'aimer
Tout ce qu'ils t'disent, c'est de n'jamais t'aimer
Depuis qu't'es petit, on n'a fait qu'te nier
Prends ce disque comme un bouclier

J'ai pas que réussi, j'ai aussi raté
OK, mea culpa, pour certains trucs j'plaide coupable
J'étais super dupe, super duper, mais toujours Supa Dupa
Guidé par ma niya, ça partait d'une bonne intention
J'aurais pas dû montrer patte blanche dans certaines interventions
Mais la musique dans la peau, c'était facile de m'instrumentaliser
Mais, si t'étais dans ma peau, t'aurais du mal à t'organiser
Vingt-quatre sur vingt-quatre et sept jours sur sept
J'ai mal au cœur, je pète un câble les frères partent en sucette
Pour ça que je fuis le succès, que j’sabote ma propre recette
Tu l'savais pas?
Maintenant tu le sais!
J'suis cul nul, prêt à tousser
Et ma question préférée ""Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire de toute cette jeunesse?""
Qui vit en accéléré, veut faire du chiffre à toute vitesse
C'est le retour de Disiz La Peste, sur ce son c'est Disiz la Tess
Ma question préférée ""Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire des mecs de tièks?""
Rendus sourds à l'amour, des balles en guise de Boules Quiès
Ma jeunesse pète les plombs pour des grosses fesses, des grosses caisses
Et c'est comme au grec, le système au-dessus de nos têtes
Avec son fusil à aiguiser, aiguise nos épées de Damoclès
Mal aiguillés au début comme le train fou de Denzel
Dans ma rue RedBull et Vodka, donnent plus que des ailes
Ils se transforment en gogols, font des tractions avec leurs auréoles
Les petits disent au juge ""Donne-moi ta peine de prison qu'on rigole""
Je n'ai aucun plaisir à rapper ce que je rappe
Pourtant, c'est triste à dire, faut bien que je propose un contraste
Je reviens du pire, j'me suis sorti d'un contrat
J'suis pas tout seul, mon nom de famille pourrait être Sonacotra
Plus que vrai, j'suis transparent, comme ça la vie est plus belle
Mon cœur est gros et rouge sang, le leur c'est du Babibel
Penser que je copie quelqu'un, c'est l'hôpital qui se fout de la morgue
Personne n'invente plus rien, juste l'agonie qui s'fout de la mort
Les signes extérieurs d’richesse cachent des preuves intérieures de pauvreté
Je défoncerai vos palais comme un joueur de hockey
L'État manipule le diable comme un magasinier
Et j'ai bien peur que pour changer ça, faudra plus que s'indigner
Ah yeah, aveugles comme des cyclopes borgnes
Font des coupes gorges au destin et rêvent de comptes off-shore
Je fais partie de ces MC qui se sentent obligés
Je répands l'amour comme le Sida, sans me protéger
J'fais pas d'oseille sur la misère, leur rap est fratricide
Mauvaise influence sur les frères ont oublié que par ici
On te monte en l'air et te descend du bout de doigts comme une chaise de bureau
Donc j'envoie du love, c'est ma part du boulot

Donne-moi mes lettres de noblesse, donne-moi mes props, motherfucker
Hahahahahahahahaha
J'ai mérité cet oseille, donne-moi mon chèque, motherfucker
Hahahahahahahahaha
Donne-moi mes lettres de noblesse, donne-moi mes props, motherfucker
J'aime trop le pe-ra hahahahahahahahaha
J'ai mérité cet oseille, j'sais quoi en faire, motherfucker
Je suis trop hahahahahahahahaha

J'vais tellement tous les crever, croiront qu'leur nom de famille c'est R.I.P
Si c'est l'nerf de la guerre, j'ferais pas de l'oseille, j'ferais du P.I.B
Mon style de rap est prohibé, j'ai trop d'idées
J'suis pas trop intelligent, c'est juste toi qu'est trop te-bê'
Ils disent ""Disiz, c'est du rap intello"", eux ne font qu'des jeux de mots
Les initiales ""MC"", chez eux, ça veut dire ""Maître Capello""
Des punchlines Carambar, tous convaincus que c'est bien
Avec vos jeux de mots tout nazes, des MC Patrick Sébastien
Rappeurs débiles dans ma ligne de mire
C'est ma bataille de Badr, y'a pas de débat, c'est dead
Et, de rap en rap, c'est de pire en pire
J'ai pas une barbe pour rien, j'ai pris du poil de la bête
Et rappeur solo, j'ai la force d'un groupe
Pendant que tu les bois, moi, je mets des coups
Prends soin de ma sape, soin de ma coupe
Prends soin de ma femme, soin de mon couple
Et je fuis le succès, je sabote mes propres recettes
Tu l'savais pas, maintenant tu l'sais, j'suis cul nu, prêt à tousser
Plus rien à cacher, j'suis détaché dans le sens où je n'ai plus de tâche
J'me suis fâché, auto-clashé, je ne suis plus en otage
À tous les étages, le building brûle, putain j'ai la Raging Bull!
Revenu comme Jordan au Chicago Bulls
Maintenant, les gars me calculent

Disiz,"C'est l'histoire de quelqu'un qui naît dans la merde, 
Qui subit les aléas de la vie et qui, malgré tout, 
Tente d'atteindre la sérénité. 
Un lotus dans un marécage, 
Cette fleur qui pousse dans le limon, traverse l'eau, 
Et s'épanouit au ciel

Disiz la Peste,"Je ne fais que rapper ça doit te saoûler à la longue
Faire un album c'est à la mode mais faut se foutre de la gueule du
monde
Lis mes paroles dans le fasicule peur du ridicule

Je ne vais pas te parler de grosses caisses ni de grosses tasses
Quitte à devant mes sauces perdent la face rien que ça
Ça se trouve y'a que moi qui me comprend
C'est pas grave mets la chanson d'après tu sais que je peux
Comprendre
"" attends je vais essayer un truc ""
Putain je prends le mic combien de gosses m'écoutent
Aucune idée donc je n'en n'ai pas rien à foutre
Pas comme un joueur de foot moi on m'entends on m'ausculte
Parfois modèle des jeunes j'aimerai tant faire une chanson culte
Peut-être que musique et religion ne s'accordent pas
J'ai trop de mots sur la conscience faudrait parfois l'accord parental
Quoique parfois les parents sont pires que les gosses
J'ai trop de maux sur la conscience c'est pour ça que je me force
Je m'autocensure par peur que mes dires soient pris à l'envers
Je suis pas là pour légitimer les petits cons dans leur merde
Je ne suis pas là pour faire le prêcheur encore moins l'engraineur
Pour faire ma pute dans mes textes vous divertir sur le bonheur
J'ai des valeurs sûres je ne fais pas du rap conscient
Je fais du rap pour ceux qui ont un brin de conscience
Des fois je me marre parce que je ne suis pas coincé du uk
Fais pas du rap trop politique fais pas des rimes trop prolifiques

Pour cette poursuite qu'est ce qui me force à faire ça
Je suis pieds nus les ronces m'écorchent ca veut m'égorger

Ghetto sitcom ghetto soap opera
J'fait ma sauce pour c'texte
J'ferai d'la house en pera
Et comprendra qui pourra, les histoires d'amour sont rares
Beaucoup en rêve le soir, j'vais t'raconter une histoire
Y'a deux personnages qu'on nommera lui et elle
Chacun vivant dans une cité qui pourrait être la tienne
Lui, genre de lascar toujours en coste-la
Prototype du mec toujours plein de potes mais pas trop vicelard
Elle, plutôt jolie fille souvent en la city
Prototype d'la zouz que ses copines veulent toujours imiter
Lui, était dans Carrefour, quelques courses pour sa mère
Pour une fois tout seul c'est rare quand il est cette heure
Elle, depuis une demi-heure le suit
Le regarde discrètement tape son ce-vi n'a qu'une envie
C'est qu'il vienne la voir, lui c'est pas trop son genre
C'est pas grave il s'dit qu'il lui parlera dehors
Un quart d'heure après il s'décide à l'accoster
Il dit ""Excuse-moi, j'ai repéré qu'tu m'as repéré""
Elle dit ""Moi? Mais, nan, c'est toi qui mate depuis une heure discrètement""
Là c'est elle qui ment, comme d'hab, fait son ce-vi d'meuf
Tape son bluff qu'elle s'en tape en fait est plus discrète

N'arrêtait pas d'me suivre, j'me demande c'qui m'trouvait""
Et faut qu'j'vous explique, ça c'est l'ce-vi d'la meuf

Vas-y raconte, raconte, il t'a dit quoi l'gars""

Philosophe du ghetto range tes bagages du gars qu'à tout vu
Qu'à tout fait mon cul, t'as trente ans tu glandes encore
Tu vis toujours chez tes parents et pour les aider tu dors
Pourtant c'est pas d'ta faute, c'est à cause de l'État
Si on t'écoutes bah t'es un modèle faut faire comme toi
Pas être esclave de cette société de consommation

Tout n'est pas tout beau tout rond, mais arrête de jurer sur le Coran
Tout le temps, toutes les cinq minutes, c'est un automatisme
Pour une barrette de shit, dire walaï c'est le traumatisme
C'est l'tisse-mé, je tise pas mais je peux te comprendre
Tant que tu légitimes pas, t'emprisonnes dans ton rôle

Tu parles de la rue et des rôles qu'on y joue
Quoi d'neuf à part ça?
Ça me tape sur le systéme ""ya"" ""ah-gah""
Tu parles des cages d'escaliers, mais quel âge t'as?
Tu veux qu'j'achète ton bédo mais t'es H.S

T'es H.S., t'as plus de pile, tellement tu bois, t'as plus de bile
T'exploses ton foie, tu me parles de foi mec, t'es débile

Je suis le nouvel observateur en pleine expansion
T'as le droit de savoir ce qui me révolte
Je suis un envoyé spécial remonté à 3000 volts
Les complaintes de la reconnaissance c'est ce qui m'a blessé
Toute mon enfance à me chercher je l'ai passé
Avec ce manque de reconnaissance ce qui m'a décidé
Y'a une faille dans ton système putain c'est que j' t'ai percé
Disiz la peste j'prône la paix tout le monde le sait
Avec j'pète les plombs j'ai eu tout ce succès
On m'a invité à faire des émissions pour que je joue ce rôle
Essaye de me faire croire que mes paroles ne sont que drôles
Quand ils veulent du sensationnel ils appellent Joey Starr
Quand c'est du negro peace and love c'est Mc solaar
Essaye de me coudre sur la peau cette étiquette
Avec des points de suture en fer pour que jamais je ne l'enlève
L'étiquette du rappeur casquette basket misogyne et sans hygiène
Pas grand chose dans la tête
C'que je viens annoncer à cet auditoire est effroyable
C'est que depuis le départ je joue leur jeu c'est vrai mais incroyable
Je suis parfait prototype qui contrecare tous tes clichés
L'antithèse du rap de base avec qui tu nous a lynché
Depuis Olivier Cachin et paris city rappin
HIP HOP ce cliché fut rapide
Je suis ton nouveau prof d'histoire j'te remémore ses éléments
C'est grave aujourd'hui les cd sont les livres de demain
Wesh mon frère, laisse cette pierre, laisse cette innocente vitrine
Si c'est toi qui tires tu transformes le tireur en victime
Je souffle sur ce molotov que tu mets sous ce coffre
Quel cadeau tu leur offres ils ont rendu ton âme amorphe
Pose ce molotov pour eux j'ai mieux que du héros j'ai l'étoffe
J'écris des textes sur des feuilles qui tombent partout comme en automne
Retranscris notre histoire à pleins livres en plusieurs tomes
Grossiste j'te vends d'la vérité j'peux t'en livrer des tonnes
Métisse donc pas monochrome c'est un homme au cromi
On m'a promis pour trop me le mettre
Depuis la petite école et ces maîtres envoie-leur ce sms
Maîtres et maîtresses pour moi le monde est une bibliothèque
Merci de m'avoir appris à lire maintenant gardez vos cours
J'apprenais plus vite dans la cour merci beaucoup
Pire qu'un pavé pire qu'un molotov
C'que j'aime c'est apprendre et ensuite je le rap et des gens m'entendent
J'me cultive lis des livres fais des noeuds avec mes racines
On nous a pas tout appris donc j'vous envoie un signe
Personne ne m'a dit d'où je venais j'ai dû chercher moi-même
Et ça y est je me suis retrouvé
Je suis le nouveau prof d'histoire, est-ce que tout le monde est présent
La tâche sera dure, 5 minutes pour parler de 500 ans


Ah ouais t'as toujours pas compris que j'ai repris ce que tu m'avais pris
Avec ceux-ci je reconstruis ce que tu as détruit
Dans les librairies j'ai appris ce qui n'a pas de prix
Je prie pour que ces écrits portent un jour leurs fruits
Maîtresse tu m'as rien appris sur mon Afrique
Est-ce que parce que t'as honte ou bien parce que t'as tout pris
Tu m'as pas dit que la guerre d'Indochine c'était de ta faute
Tu m'as pas dit que la guerre d'Algérie c'était de ta faute
Tu m'as pas dit que si l'Afrique est pauvre c'est de ta faute
Tu m'as pas dit que l'Occident a fait un puzzle avec le monde
Je suis le nouveau prof d'histoire, le cours d'aujourd'hui c'est sur thiaroye 44
Tu m'as parlé de Molière, Flaubert, Baudelaire
Moi c'est Senghor, Saizère et Martin Luther
Tu m'as parlé de De Gaulle et de Napoléon
Moi c'est Mandela, Loumoumba et Steeve Biko
Où sont les discussions à Saint Germain de Boris Vian, Sartre
Tu as oublié de nous dire qu'ils nous ont fait du bien
Maîtresse tu m'as pas dit qu'après la seconde guerre mondiale
10 ans fut le temps de l'embargo contre l'Allemagne
10 ans pour un pays qui a embrasé le monde
Alors que déjà 12 ans pour l'Irak et ses puits de pétrole
Je suis le nouveau prof d'histoire
Je prépare mes cours très tard le soir
Contre les politiques qui devant le pupitre se lèvent et mentent
Je bois un thé à la menthe et là je rappe avec véhémence
L'icône que tu me donnes me pousse à être stupide
Ta culture de masse m'asphyxie et j'la suicide
J'suis pas communiste j'suis pas islamiste je suis juste lucide
Et je sais ce que je sais
Je suis le nouveau prof d'histoire dans ce Etat français
Monsieur le prof, les Egyptiens étaient des négroïdes
Où je l'ai su ? C'est Cheikh Anta Diop qui me l'a dit
Les caucasiens ont un passé assez sombre
L'apogée de vos anciens empires a ses ombres
Nous ne sommes pas assez nombreux
Ce cours d'histoire aujourd'hui c'est pour comprendre
Adopter le mot prendre, oublier le mot rendre
Garde ton argent, tu penses payer nos cendres
Mes connaissance augmentent de janvier à décembre
Attention je ne discute plus en bas d'un hall
ni au pied d'un baobad tard le soir au Sénégal
Pas autour d'un bedo ni autour d'une teillbou

Disiz la Peste,"La fin de l’enfance, la fin des rêves, la fin des temps
A Dieu ma jolie reine, ma jolie zique que j’aimais tant
Que je le veuille ou non, je suis passé dans le can des grands
J’avais pas le cran de crever, je voulais crever l’écran
J’étais tout seul le temps
Mon premier crime fût de tuer le temps
As-tu lu le dernier article qui dit que Disiz quitte le ring ?
En ça il n’y a rien de dramatique, c’est juste la fin d’un cycle
Enfin t’y peux y voir un signe, je partage ton opinion
Les m éandres sont magiques et c’est la sortie que nous fuyons
Nous vivons à reculons, les yeux rivés sur le passé
Puis on recule , on voit que la vie s’est tassé
Les yeux d’enfant sont cassés, rêves de cristal
Que je le veuille ou non, mon destin fait du freestyle
La fin d’un jeu, la fin d’un son, la fin d’un titre
Pourquoi la fin d’un flow, alors que j’en ai encore des litres ?
La fin d’un verre, la fin d’un joint, la fin d’un spliff
La fin d’une prière un matin, la fin d’un livre
La fin de Marvin, la fin de Bob, la fin de Big
La fin de Pac, la fin de X, la fin de King
La fin de Tony, j’ai bien vu la fin du film
Enfants des taudis, ce sera bientôt la fin des ruines
La faim décide, pas pour bientôt la fin des crimes
La fin du monde, la fin d’un cycle, la fin du titre",Disiz the End,2009
Disiz la Peste,"Je viens de l’île des enfants perdus, je ne veux plus grandir
Car là d’où je viens, on m’a fait grandir trop vite
La nuit je chasse mon ombre en essayant de me trouver
Pouvoir me définir si seulement je le pouvais

On est plein d’enfants perdus, peu importent les frontières
Pénuries de rêves dans un monde imaginaire
Alors la nuit on danse comme des tarés, la journée on est égaré
Au fond ce que l’on pense, on aimerai se barrer

La fée Clochette a plusieurs rôles, pour certains c’est la drogue
Dures ou douces, peu importe, pour d’autres c’est l’alcool
Pour d’autres c’est le love, les jeunes font ce qu’ils peuvent
Mais ce qui est sûr, c’est qu’on veut s’échapper de ce monde

JE NE VEUX PLUS GRANDIR ET LE TEMPS PASSE TROP VITE
IL FAUT CHERCHER L’HORLOGE DANS LE VENTRE DU CROCODILE
JE NE VEUX PLUS GRANDIR J’AI ENVIE DE PARTIR
CALME TOI PETIT BONHOMME IL FAUT PAS FAIRE DE BETISES

On m’a infantilisé, on m’a aussi utilisé
On m’a souvent divisé et toujours diabolisé
Alors je me suis mis en marge et je me suis pris en charge
Mais malheureusement, je suis devenu mon propre otage

Comme une impression de faire tache, dans la rue quand je marche
Je me sens comme un punk que l’on croise et que l’on toise
Il y a trop de jugement, trop de capitaine Crochet
Tous ces anciens profs, ces keufs et certains parents proches

Tout un tas de reproches, à leurs désirs tu t’accroches
Et t’oublis les tiens pour être sûr que dans tes poches
Il y ait toujours ce qu’il faut, alors tu vis pour les autres
Mais au fond de toi t’aimerais t’échapper de ce monde

JE NE VEUX PLUS GRANDIR ET LE TEMPS PASSE TROP VITE
IL FUT CHERCHER L’HORLOGE DANS LE VENTRE DU CROCODILE
JE NE VEUX PLUS GRANDIR J’AI ENVIE DE PARTIR

Donne-moi un pot de peinture que je repeigne la ville
Je ne peux plus voir en peinture ceux qui gouvernent ma vie
Que de la merde à la radio, des trucs insipides
Et pour que tu achètes on te fait un clip stupide

Un copié collé de ce qui se fait aux states
Et ainsi font, font, font les petites marionnettes
Un beat bien punk pour un flow bien hip hop

En fait, j'retiens que le mal, en fait

Du solltest mir vertrauen, denn ich bin dein Freund
Und ich bin überall wo man glaubt, dass man was versäumt

Wie gutes Gras zu Hause doch sind wir schon erwachsen
Hey wir haben doch Spaß am Leben oder
Komm mit mir gib Gas sollen die andern doch vermodern
Komm ich seh' du traust mir nicht so ganz oder
Weil innerlich gehst du ein bisschen auf Distanz oder
Lass alles fallen mein Freund die Neugier ist die Macht
Und die Vernunft in deinem Kopf wird ausgelacht
Ich lad' dich ein auf meine Party die das Leben ist
Drum mach dir heute keine Sorgen wann du mit mir eben bist
Ich hab das Ticket für dich und deine Lust mein Sohn
Frag nicht wie ich heiße denn das weißt du schon

Ganz genau ich sehe deine Seele weil ich schau in deine
Augen mein Freund und was ich seh' ist grau
Wie damals als sie von dir ging
Und hinter deinem Rücken über dich zu reden anfing
Du hast gesucht nach einem Freund der dir die Hand reicht
Doch Einsamkeit ist kalt wenn sie sich anschleicht
In dieser Zeit warst du nichts als ein Außenseiter
Warst bald bereit für mich und wurdest mein Begleiter
Wir ham ein draufgemacht die ganze Nacht
Dieses Fest war so ein Rausch wir sind nicht aufgewacht
Denn dieser Rausch war viel dichter als die Reue von dir
Überall die lachenden Gesichter alles Freunde von mir
Drum hör nicht auf die andern wie sie Ratschläge geben
Vom Überleben durch bewegen reden
Die kochen doch nur hoch was schon vergessen ist
Komm zu mir und bleibe wie du bist

Ja pass' nur auf dich auf und gib acht
Und klink' dich ruhig aus wenn du glaubst, dass es keinen Sinn mehr macht
Doch ich kenne deine Vorstellung von Glück ganz egal
Wie wir uns trennen sicher ist du kommst zurück
Denn die Versuchung ist groß und ich bin es auch ich
Konsum gebraucht von dir verbrauch dich
Der Weg zu mir ist kurz und bequem
Nur du und ich und das System
Denn du kannst zwar machen was du willst aber nicht wollen was du willst
Die Unfreiheit des Willens ist ein Pilz der wuchert
Und wächst über Dein Gehirn reagiert mit deinem
Komplex und ich Konsum düng' dieses Gewächs
Sie ist löslich diese Angst die sich in dir staut
In dem Nebel von dem Kraut in dem Getränk von mir gebraut
Und in allem was du magst was ist dir lieber schhh

'Morning, Monsieur
Where are you off to
The bookshop. I just finished the most wonderful story
about a beanstalk and an ogre and a
That's nice. Marie, the baguettes hurry up

Look there she goes that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell
Never part of any crowd

Ah, Belle
Good Morning. I've come to return the book I borrowed
Finished already
Oh, I couldn't put it down. Have you got anything new
Ha Ha! Not since yesterday
That's all right. I'll borrow, this one
That one? But you've read it twice
Well, it's my favorite! Far off places, daring sword fights
magic spells, a prince in disguise
If you like it all that much, it's yours
But sir
I insist
Well, thank you. Thank you very much

Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three

Now it's no wonder that her name means ""beauty""
Her looks have got no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very diff'rent from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle

Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston, You're the greatest
hunter in the whole world!
I know.
No beast alive stands a chance against you. Ha ha ha and
no girl, for that matter.
It's true, LeFou. And I've got my sights set on that one
Hmm the inventor's daughter
She's the one - the lucky girl I'm going to marry
But she's
The most beautiful girl in town.
I know, but
That makes her the best. And don't I deserve the best
Well, of course! I mean you do, but

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy

Oh he's so cute
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing

To the bells of Notre Dame
The fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
To the big bells as loud as the thunder
To the little bells soft as a psalm
And some say the soul of the city is
The toll of the bells
The bells of Notre Dame

Dark was the night when our tale was begun
On the docks near Notre Dame

Four frightened gypsies slid silently under
The docks near Notre Dame

But a trap had been laid for the gypsies
And they gazed up in fear and alarm
At a figure whose clutches
Were iron as much as the bells

The bells of Notre Dame

To purge the world
Of vice and sin

On the steps of Notre Dame

Now you would add this child's blood to your guilt
On the steps of Notre Dame

You can lie to yourself and your minions
You can claim that you haven't a qualm
But you never can run from
Nor hide what you've done from the eyes
The very eyes of Notre Dame

And for one time in his live
Of power and control

Frollo felt a twinge of fear
For his immortal soul

Just so he's kept locked away
Where no one else can see

Yet prove one day to be
Of use to me

Little handsome piggy wigs
For the big, bad the very big, very bad wolf
They did not give three figs

Number one was very gay
And he built his house with hay
With a hey hey toot he blew on his flute
And he played around all day

Now number two was fond of jigs
And so he built his house with twigs
Hey, diddle diddle he played on his fiddle
And danced with lady pigs

Number three said, ""Nix on tricks
I shall build my house with bricks""
He had no chance to sing or dance
'Cause work and play don't mix

Ha, ha, ha, the two little do little pigs
Just winked and laughed ah, woo

Came the day when fate did frown
And a wolf blew into town
With a gruff huff puff, he puffed just enough
And the hay house fell right down

One and two were scared to death
Of the big bad wolf's breath
By the hair of your chinny chin I'll blow you in
And the twig house answered yes

No one left but number three
To save that piglet family
So when they knocked, he fast unlocked
And said come in with me

Now they all were safe inside
But the bricks hurt wolf's pride
So, he slid down the chimney and oh, by Jiminey
In a fire he was fried

Where the gulls fly free
Don't know what for
What I dream the day might send
Jut around the riverbend
For me
Coming for me

I feel it there beyond those trees
Or right behind these waterfalls
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming
For a handsome sturdy husband
Who builds handsome sturdy walls
And never dreams that something might be coming?

To send their wanted son
Up to the White House, yes,

To voice their discontent
Unto the Pres-I-dent

What has swept this continent?
If tin whistles are made of tin,
What do they make fog horns out of?

You can't step in the same river twice
The water's always changing, always flowing

But people, I guess, can't live like that
We all must pay a price
To be safe, we lose our chance of ever knowing

What's around the river bend
Waiting just around the river bend

I look once more just around the river bend
Beyond the shore where the gulls fly free
Don't know what for what I dream the day might send
Just around the river bend for me, coming for me

I feel it there beyond those trees
Or right behind these waterfalls
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming?

For a handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls
And never dreams that something might be coming?

Just around the river bend
Just around the river bend

I look once more just around the river bend
Beyond the shore somewhere past the sea
Don't know what for why do all my dreams extend
Just around the river bend, just around the river bend

Steady as the beating drum? Should I marry Kocoum?

How could I make a man out of you?

Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

Pink elephants on parade
Here they come
Hippety hoppety
They're here and there
Pink elephants everywhere

Look out! Look out!
They're walking around the bed
On their head

Arrayed in braid

What'll I do
What'll I do
What an unusual view

I can stand the sight of worms
And look at microscopic germs
But technicolor pachyderms is really too much for me

I am not the type to faint
When things are odd or things are quaint
But seeing things you know that ain't
Can certainly give you an awful fright

What a sight!
Chase 'em away! Chase 'em away
I'm afraid, need your aid

That I'm looking for love

Only found when you're young and it's May
Only found on that wonderful day
When all longing is through
I'm seeking that glow
Only found when a thrill is complete
Only found when two hearts gently beat
To the strains of a waltz that's both tender and new

I bring you a song
For I'm seeking romance
You're by my side

It shines with a light that's so mellow and bright
It's easy to see that tonight we shall fall in love

This could be the room of any small boy, but it just
happens to belong to a boy named Christopher Robin. Like
most small boys, Christopher Robin has toy animals to play
with, and they all live together in a wonderful world of
make-believe. But, his best friend is a bear called Winnie
the Pooh or Pooh for short. Now Pooh had some very unusual
adventures, and they all happened right here in the hundred
acre wood.

One we've never known
We would never need
To face the world alone
They can have their world
We'll create our own
I may not be brave or strong or smart
But somewhere in my secret heart

I know love will find a way, anywhere I go
I'm home if you are there beside me
Like dark, turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now that I've found you
Love will find a way

I was so afraid
Now I realize
Love is never wrong
And so it never dies
There's a perfect world
Shining in your eyes
And if only they could feel it too
The happiness I feel with you

They'd know love will find a way

Dispatch,"There was a decorated General with a heart of gold
That likened him to all the stories he told
Of past battles won and lost and legends of old
A seasoned veteran in his own time

On the battlefield he gained respect for fame
With many metals of bravery and stripes to his name
He grew a beard as soon as he could to cover the scars on his face
And always urged his men on

But on the eve of great battle with the infantry and dream
The old general tossed in his sleep and wrestled with its meaning
He awoke from that night to tell what he had seen
And walked slowly out of his tent

All the men held tall with their chests in the air
With the courage in their blood and a fire in their stare
And it was a gray morning and they all wondered how they would fair
Till the old general told them to go home

He said
I have seen the others 
And I have discovered 
That this fight is not worth fighting
And I've have seen their mothers 
And I will no other 
To follow me where I'm going

So, take your shower, shine your shoes
You got no time to lose
You are young men, you must be living
Take your shower, shine your shoes
Well, you got no time to lose
You are young men, you must be living
Go now, you are forgiven

But the men stood fast with their guns on their shoulders
Not knowing what to do with the contradicting orders
The general said he would do his own duty but he would extend it no further
The men could go as they pleased

But not a man moved, their eyes gazed straight ahead
Till one by one they stepped back and not a word was said
And the old general was left with his own words echoing in his head
He then prepared to fight 

He said
I have seen the others 
And I have discovered 
That this fight is not worth fighting, no
And I've have seen their mothers 
And I will no other 
To follow me where I'm going

My head turning like a race car wheel
Maybe I'll try to say hi another time
I've gotta find a way to get inside your mind
I'll talk smoothe and walk one step closer

Question yoursel, are you really what you seem?
Say what you want, say what you mean
Question yoursel, are you really what you dream?

But she slides on by
Not even a second look
She took the bait right off that hook
I've got my blinders on tight
I pull my cap a little lower
I can't hide away

you might think that this is easy for me
But there's a lot of things you don't know
You don't care, you don't want to see
Long while since I've got myself across
But maybe there's a reason for that
Even if I caught you I'd throw you back.

hey... hey...

I really don't wan to fall back
Because you don't seem like you care
And if I would fall back
You don't seem like you care
And if I would fall back
You don't seem like you care

fall down your back, fall down your back
Fall down your back, fall down your back

You can't keep your eyes away
From the TV

With your face on the ground
Too tired to hear the sound
Of a child on the rooftops
And he was kicking off slate

And you were void of hate

Where the smiles last for days

Into a square car

With the keys in his lap

What happened to the blinking red lights

And I should stand up for my friends
Because I believe in them
And if someone puts them down
Why am I silent till the end

Because I'm smiling whenever you're nearby

Out of anything anymore
And you pass a car turned over on the side of the road
You contemplate a reversal of the roles
But you don't pull over to help
You'll forget about it
Three seconds down the road
Well have you figured it out
Have you figure it out
Well have you figured it out
Have you figured it out
Well have you figured it out
Have you figured it out
Cause I haven't got a clue
And I held everything against you
Because you see you never held anything at all
Against me

Because I'm smiling whenever you're nearby

An execution without merit looms ahead
Tell me why!

I was a boy who had to live his own way
I never fit into the model they had designed
I chose a path less taken
I stood with others who had often felt the same

We got stares from passersby
Our dark attire seemed to frighten people away
And when the three young boys died
They pointed fingers and entangled us in a lie!

No hope in sight

I sit here terrified!
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light?
Won't anybody open up their eyes?
Before the three of us have lost our lives!

Why was everybody so damn afraid?
They blamed the devil for the heinousness of the crime
And to justify their own faith
We were labeled pawns of Satan for a time

The three of us were attacked and disgraced
For many hours we were questioned and someone lied
One of us couldn't take it
His simple manner was manipulated in kind
Fear made him lie

We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight

I can feel the calling again
The primal need is filling me
Changes are about to begin
And now my blood is boiling
I can see the fear in your eyes
But you cant bring yourself to scream
Time to shed the mortal disguise
The beast is coming to life
Taking more than a glimmer of this tainted moonlight
Death approaches on this night

For the animals soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight

We begin the hunt tonight
Til the power courses the creatures take flight
When the kill is close and I will be satisfied
For the smell of fear tonight
Wakes an ancient lust that will not be denied
You're mine

For the animals soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes

And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight

For the animals soul is mine
And the world around will never hear your cries
An unholy crime

Barely even remember when
There was nothing left to hide and
She has found a way inside, then
I was forced to walk alone
Living in an empty home
All I wanted was to hide and
Try to numb the ache inside
And I'm still afraid of the light
And a thousand voices share their laughter at my demise

Now if I am to survive
The infection must die
Murder the beast that's been eating me alive
The infection must die

Nothing left but a broken man
Terrified of everything
Nothing left of his foolish pride, his
Fond memories slowly die, then
As he wakes again alone
Still a prisoner in his home
Ready to allow the dark to
Penetrate his broken heart
And I'm still afraid of the light (of the light)
And a thousand voices share their laughter at his demise

Let the shadow permeate your mind and
Reveal the thoughts that were tucked away

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

Fools, said I, you do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds of silence",The Sound of Silence,2015

We had to stay strong (let's do it again)
No matter what we went through (do it a)
It was me and my crew (let's do it again)
And that's how it went (do it a)
When we were kids (let's do it again)

I had a Long John but no Silver, no gold or plat (do it a)
I was simply red from the years I been holdin' back (let's do it again)
With two sides to a book I lick stamps and light matches (do it a)
And set fires in garbage pales and cabbage patches (let's do it again)
A child of the corn been wild since I was born (do it a)
Climbin' over barbed wire, clothes got torn (let's do it again)
Shoes got muddy and my click turned cruddy (do it a)
Wherever I go they went they my buddies (let's do it again)
I brush teeth, brush naps and calm streets (do it a)
Dreamin' of Cadillacs, wood wheels and plush seats (let's do it again)
Cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats (do it a)
Macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf (let's do it again)
When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for ac-tion! (do it a)
Starin' at beer cans and a moment to crack one (let's do it again)
want to hang with the big boys and play with the big toys (do it a)
And be with the people makin all that got damn noise, man (let's do it again)

I remember, Swatch Watches, Izod, Berries (do it a)
Levi Denims, dried eyed jerry-curls (let's do it again)
Back when the girls wore striped chick jeans (do it a)
Straight leg Lee's on, sewn at the seams (let's do it again)
Borrowing dope paint was all good if ya head-bang (do it a)
Long as you was ridin, you ain't need to have game (let's do it again)
And even back then chicks were starvin' touch status (do it a)
You either had a car, favorite Jordan, or kept static (let's do it again)
Old school homies did nothin but block rag (do it a)
Stay gone off the Olde E and pop James (let's do it again)
Moms had to monitor the niggas ya hung around (do it a)
To the point when you came in the house when they came around (let's do it again)
And - My dad was dead so these streets had to raise me (do it a)
And even back in 1983 shit was crazy (let's do it again)
Young, black, broke, drunk, beer, smoke (do it a)
It's good they kicked my ass outta' the school, fuck the principal (let's do it again)

We were tryin so hard (do it a)
Hard to survive (let's do it again)
'Cause even though we were young (do it a)
We had to stay strong (let's do it again)
No matter what we went through (do it a)
It was me and my crew (let's do it again)
And that's how it went (do it a)
When we were kids (let's do it again)

We were tryin' so hard (do it a)
Hard to survive (let's do it again)
'Cause even though we were young (do it a)
We had to stay strong (let's do it again)
No matter what we went through (do it a)
It was me and my crew (let's do it again)
And that's how it went (do it a)
When we were kids (let's do it again)

Disturbing tha Peace,"[Chorus: x2]
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way

Oh no! the fight's out
I'ma 'bout to punch yo lights out
Get the fuck back, guard ya grill
There's somethin' wrong, we can't stay still
I've been drankin' and bustin' two
And I been thankin' of bustin' you
Upside ya motherfuckin' forehead
And if your friends jump in, ""ohhh gurrlll"", they'll be mo' dead
Causin' confusion, disturbin tha peace
Since not into lution', we run in the streets
So bye-bye to all you groupies and golddiggers
Is there a bumper on your ass? no nigga!
I'm doin' a hundred on the highway
So if you do the speed limit, get the fuck outta my way
I'm d.u.i., hardly ever caught sober
And you about to get ran the fuck over

[Chorus]

Bitch! watch out, watch out, watch out
Bitch! watch out, watch out, watch out, move

Here I come, there I go
Uh oh! don't jump bitch, move
You see them headlights? you hear that fuckin' crowd?
Start that goddamn show, I'm comin' through
Hit the stage and knock the girlies down
I fuck the crowd up - that's what I do
Young and successful - a sex symbol
The bitches want me to fuck - true true
Hold up wait up, shorty
""Oh wazzzupp, get my dick sucked, what are you doin'?""
Sidelinin' my fuckin' bussiness
Tryin' to get my paper, child support soon
Give me that truck and take that rental back
Who bought these fuckin' t.v.'s and jewelry bitch, tell me that?
No, I ain't bitter, I don't give a fuck
But I'ma tell you like this bitch
You better not walk in front of my tour bus

[Chorus]

Bring it, get 'em

Too bad I'm on the right track
Beef, got the right mack
Hit the trunk, grab the pump pump, I'll be right back
We buyin' bars out, showin' scars out
We heard there's hoes out, so we brought the cars out
Grab the peels cuz we robbin' tonight
Beat the shit outta security, we startin a fight
I got a fifth of the remy, fuck the belve and 'cris
I'm sellin' shit up in the club like I work in the bitch
Fuck the dress codes, it's street clothes, we all street niggaz
We on the dance floor, throwin' bows, beatin' up niggaz
I'm from the d.e.c., tryin' to disrespect d.t.p.
And watch the bottles start flyin' from the v.i.p.
Fuck this rap shit, we clap bitch, two in your body
Grab ya four, start a fight dog, ruin the party
So move bitch, get out the way hoe
All you faggot motherfuckers make way for 2-0
So
