Bertha Gonsoulin,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,2013
Bertha Gonsoulin,"Won't you come along with me
To the Mississippi
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams
Steam down the river, down to New Orleans

The band's there to meet us
Old friends there to greet us
Where all the proud and elite folks meet
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street

Basin Street is the street
Where the best folks always meet
In New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never know how nice it seems,
Or just how much it really means

Glad to be, oh yes-sirree
Where welcome's free and dear to me
Where I can lose, lose my Basin Street Blues

Basin Street, oh Basin Street
Is the street, mama 
New Orleans, land of dreams",Basin Street Blues [#],2015
Bertha Hope,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,1992
Bertha Hope,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entre nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory,1998
Bertha Lee,"Just look
Just look what the Lord has done
Lord I know
Lord I know I'm coming home

It was one morning, when (the cat come?) in the room

Oh hush
Oh hush, somebody is calling me

It was one morning, (when you get some) in the room

Oh death
Oh death, has killed my mother-in-law (mother and pa?)

Oh moon, my pillow? turned my bed around?

Oh hush",Oh Death,1997
Berthold Matschat,"Life is bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour I'm
Choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
The hint of the century
Consider this
The slip that brought me
To my knees failed
What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around
Now I've said too much
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream",Losing My Religion,2006
Bertice Reading,"A-Tisket A-Tasket
A green and yellow basket
I bought a basket for my mommie
On the way I dropped it
I dropped it, I dropped it
Yes on the way I dropped it
A little girlie picked it up
And took it to the market
She was truckin' on down the 
Avenue without a single thing to do
She was peck, peck, peckin' all around
When she spied it on the ground
A-Tisket A-Tasket
She took my yellow basket 
And if she doesn't bring it back
I think that I shall die
(Was it red?)
No, no, no, no
(Was it brown?)
No, no, no, no
(Was it blue)
No, no, no, no
Just a little yellow basket","A-Tisket, A-Tasket",1994
Bertice Reading,"Now won't you listen honey, while I say, 
How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart 

You know I've loved you for these many years, 
Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears? 
Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad
You're gonna feel bad
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
But baby, think what you're doin'
I'm gonna haunt you so, I'm gonna taunt you so
It's gonna drive you to ruin
After you've gone, after you've gone away.",After You've Gone,1994
Bertice Reading,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,1994
Bertice Reading,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You,1994
Bertice Reading,"Toot, toot, Tootsie, good-bye!
Toot, toot, Tootsie, don't cry
The choo choo train that takes me
Away from you no words can tell how sad it makes me
Kiss me, Tootsie, and then
Do it over again, watch for the mail, I'll never fail
If you don't get a letter then you'll know I'm in jail
Toot, toot, Tootsie don't cry
Toot, toot, Tootsie, good-bye

Bertice Reading,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me [From Crazy for You],1996
Bertie Higgins,"I fell in love with you watching Casablanca
Back row of the drive-in show in the flickering light
Popcorn and cokes beneath the stars
Became champagne and caviar
Making love on a long hot summer's night
I thought you fell in love with me watching Casablanca
Holding hands 'neath the paddle fans
In Rick's candle lit cafe
Hiding in the shadows from the spies
Moroccan moonlight in your eyes
Making magic at the movies in my old Chevrolet

Oh a kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
But a kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
Please come back to me in Casablanca
I love you more and more each day as time goes by

I guess there're many broken hearts in Casablanca
You know I've never really been there so I don't know
I guess our love story will never be seen
On the big wide silver screen
But it hurt just as bad when I had to watch you go

Oh a kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
But a kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
Please come back to me in Casablanca
I love you more and more each day as time goes by

Oh a kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
But a kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
Please come back to me in Casablanca
I love you more and more each day as time goes by
I love you more and more each day, as time goes by",Casablanca,1982
Bertie Higgins,"The big cold city is such a lonely place to be
Hustle all day and dream of the islands and sea
Millions of girls but none of them seemed right for me
Til you came along, you touched me and set me free

So I slipped away last night, eased on down to the Key
Flyin' so high, we hitched a ride on a Gulf Stream breeze
Livin' on love and the fruits from tropical trees
A song in our hearts and our eyes on the West Indies

It's just another day in paradise
Love in the night, oh we do it so right
Seein' that 'I Love You' look in your eyes
Just another day in paradise

A bottle of rum, listen to the steel drum band
Laughin' in the moonlight, along the beach we ran
Splashin' naked in the sea, makin' love upon the sand
Fallin' fast asleep like children, hand in hand

It's just another day in paradise
Love in the night, oh we do it so right
Seein' that 'I Love You' look in your eyes
Just another day in paradise

I woke up this morning with the sunlight in my eyes
Guess it was only a dream, I hear the city outside
But I look at you sleepin' and honey now I realize
That anywhere with you is paradise

It's just another day in paradise
Love in the night, oh we do it so right
Seein' that 'I Love You' look in your eyes
Just another day in paradise

It's just another day in paradise
Love in the night, oh we do it so right
Seein' that 'I Love You' look in your eyes
Just another day in paradise",Just Another Day in Paradise,1994
Bertie Higgins,"Wrapped around each other
Trying so hard to stay warm
That first cold winter together
Lying in each other's arms
Watching those old movies
Falling in love so desperately
Honey I was your hero
And you were my leading lady.

We had it all
Just like Bogie and Bacall
Starring in our old late, late show
Sailing away to Key Largo

Honey can't you remember
We played all the parts
That sweet scene of surrender
When you gave me your heart
Please say you will...play it again
Cause I love you still
Baby this can't be the end.

We had it all
Just like Bogie and Bacall
Starring in our old late, late show
Sailing away to Key Largo

Here's lookin at you kid
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again, I know
Just like they did in Key Largo

Bertie Higgins,"Le-Leah, Leah, Le-Leah, Leah
Here I go 
From the hut to the boat to the sea
For Leah

Ah-hah I gotta go diving in the bay
Gotta get a lot of oysters find some pearls today
To make a pretty necklace for Leah
Le-e-ah

I've gotta go deep and find the ones just right
I'll bet my Leah'll be surprised tonight
I'll place the pearls around the only girl for me

But something's wrong I cannot move around
My leg is caught it's pulling me down
But I'll keep my hand shut tight for if they find me
They'll find the pearl for Leah

And now it's over I'm awake at last
Old heartaches and memories from the past
It was just another dream about my lost love

Back to sleep and in my dreams I'll dream

Bertie Higgins,"Down the way where the nights are gay
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top
I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop

But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

Sounds of laughter everywhere
And the dancing girls swaying to and fro
I must declare that my heart is there
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico

But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

Down at the market you can hear
Ladies cry out while on their head they bear
Ackie rice and salt fish is nice
And the rum is good any time of year

But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

Won't be back for many a day

Come sing me la!  Come sing me Montego Bay

Bertie Higgins,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two

Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,2006

Days when the rains came ?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey

In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a
Transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hide behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
La dee dah

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown!
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing

Lucky stars are everywhere

As a happy being
Here's what I'm foreseeing

For you, for me, forever more
It's bound to be forever more

We found, by finding each other
The love we waited for

I'm yours, you're mine

sólo mía,
mía, mía,
cuando tu piel era fresca
como la hierba mojada.

Fuiste mía,
sólo mía,
mía, mía,
cuando tu boca y tus ojos
de juventud rebosaban.

Fuiste mía,
sólo mía,
mía, mía,
cuando tus labios de niña
mis labios los estrenaban.

Fuiste mía,
sólo mía,
mía, mía,
cuando tu vientre era aún

Lo mejor de tu vida
me lo he llevado yo,
lo mejor de tu vida
lo he disfrutado yo.

Tu experiencia primera,
el despertar de tu carne,
tu inocencia salvaje,
me la he bebido yo,
me la he bebido yo. Fuiste mía,
sólo mía,
mía, mía,
cuando tu cuerpo era espiga
de palma reciénplantada.

Fuiste mía,
sólo mía,
mía, mía,
cuando cerrabas los ojos
apenas yo me acercaba.

Fuiste mía,
sólo mía,
mía, mía,
cuando temblaban tus manos
tan sólo si las rozaba.

pensabas sólo en mañana.

Bertín Osborne,"Fue en un pueblo con mar
Una noche después de un concierto
Tú reinabas detrás
De la barra del único bar que vimos abierto
""Cántame una canción
Al oído y te pongo un cubata""
""Con una condición
Que me dejes abierto el balcón de tus ojos de gata""
Loco por conocer

Los secretos de su dormitorio
Esa noche canté
Al piano del amanecer todo mi repertorio
Los clientes del bar
Uno a uno se fueron marchando
Tú saliste a cerrar
Yo me dije

""Cuidado, chaval, te estas enamorando""
Luego todo pasó
De repente, su dedo en mi espalda
Dibujo un corazón
Y mi mano le correspondió debajo de tu falda
Caminito al hostal
Nos besamos en cada farola
Era un pueblo con mar

Yo quería dormir contigo y tú no querías dormir sola
Y nos dieron las diez y las once, las doce y la una
Y las dos y las tres
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna
Nos dijimos adiós
Ojalá que volvamos a vernos
El verano acabó
El otoño duró lo que tarda en llegar el invierno

Y a tu pueblo el azar
Otra vez el verano siguiente
Me llevó, y al final
Del concierto me puse a buscar tu cara entre la gente
Y no halle quien de ti
Me dijera ni media palabra
Parecía como si
Me quisiera gastar el destino una broma macabra

No había nadie detrás
De la barra del otro verano
Y en lugar de tu bar
Me encontré una sucursal del banco hispano americano
Tu memoria vengué
A pedradas contra los cristales
""Se que no lo soñé""
Protestaba mientras me esposaban los municipales

En mi declaración
Alegué que llevaba tres copas
Y empecé esta canción
En el cuarto donde aquella vez te quitaba la ropa
Y nos dieron las diez y las once, las doce y la una
Y las dos y las tres
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna",Para Volver a Volver,2000
Bertín Osborne,"A todas ellas con amor 
Pues fueron alma y corazón 
A las que un día amé 
Siempre recordaré 
Con la ternura a flor de piel 

Aquellas que quieran venir 
Tenerme en jaula de cristal 
Tendrán que comprender 
Que quiero libertad 
Aun que termine en soledad 

Que ha sido hoy de nuestras vidas 
A donde fuimos a parar 
La soledad es el castigo 
Por no cansarnos de jugar 

A las que me hicieron sentir 
Lo hermoso y bello que es vivir

A todas ellas, y soñar

Bertín Osborne,"Cada mañana el sol nos dio
En la cara al despertar
Cada palabra que le pronuncié 
La hacía soñar

No era raro verla en el jardín 
Corriendo tras de mí
Y yo dejándome alcanzar
Sin duda, era feliz

Era una buena idea 
Cada cosa sugerida
Ver la novela en la televisión
Contarnos todo

Jugar eternamente 
El juego limpio de la seducción
Y las peleas terminarlas 
Siempre en el sillón

Me va a extrañar, al despertar
En sus paseos por el jardín
Cuando la tarde llegue a su fin

Me va a extrañar, al suspirar
Porque el suspiro será por mí
Porque el vacío la hará sufrir

Me va a extrañar, y sentirá
Que no habrá vida después de mí
Que no se puede vivir así

Me va a extrañar
Cuando tenga ganas de 
Dormir y acariciar

Al mediodía era una aventura en la cocina
Se divertía con mis ocurrencias, y reía
Cada caricia le avivaba el fuego a nuestra chimenea
Era sencillo pasar el invierno en compañía

Me va a extrañar, al despertar
En sus paseos por el jardín
Cuando la tarde llegue a su fin

Me va a extrañar, al suspirar
Porque el suspiro será por mí

Porque tú eres agua
Porque yo soy fuego
Y no nos comprendemos

Yo ya no sé si he perdido la razón
Porque tú me arrastras
Porque soy un juego
De tus sentimientos

Cuando yo creo que estás en mi poder
Tú te vas soltando, te vas escapando
De mis propias manos

Hasta ese día que tu quieres volver
Y otra vez me encuentras
Enfadado y triste, pero enamorado

Voy a perder la cabeza por tu amor
Como no despierte
De una vez por siempre
De este falso sueño

Que te estás burlando
Que te estás riendo

De esta forma loca
Que te estoy queriendo

Que golpea la ola
Soy de carne y hueso

Y quizás mañana
Oigas de mi boca
Vaya usted con Dios

Bertín Osborne,"I see trees of green, red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

I see skies of blue, clouds of white
The bright blessed day and the dark sacred night
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of the people passing by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, how do you do?""
What they're really saying is ""I love you.""

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll know much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself: What a Wonderful World
Yes I think to myself: What a Wonderful World",What a Wonderful World,
Bertín Osborne,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,2005
Bertín Osborne,"Y me lo he dicho una y otra vez
Se que las cosas tiene que cambiar
Por que este mundo todavía no se
Si es que te importo o todo te da igual

Y yo que trato siempre de acercarme
De contenerme y mantener la calma
Por que entiendo que somos humanos
Y nadie tiene la verdad en sus manos

Así que trato no tocar el fondo por precaución
Guantes de seda para no arañarte el corazon
Callarme cuando a veces tengo ganas de reventar
Pero el silencio seria mas inmenso si tu no estas

Si tu no estas
Mi vida se me va
Se me va detrás de ti
Si tu no estas mi vida
Yo no se que haré
Si tu no estas aquí

Y me lo he dicho una y otra vez
Se que las cosa tiene que cambiar
Y mientras tanto
Yo me como el coco
Pensando si te toco o no te toco

Y tu que dices que no es importante
Que hay otras cosas que valoras mas
Pero lo siento soy así de básico
Y mis instintos son bastante lógicos

Así que espero que me des luz verde para cruzar
Y demostrarte que no soy de piedra, no no es verdad
Que de lo nuestro me preocupa todo, lo sabes bien
Y que sin ti seria casi imposible de continuar

Si tu no estas
Mi vida se me va

No puedo seguir escondiéndome
Detrás del mismo escudo
En la garganta con el mismo nudo
Y ahora no, no puede ser
Capaz que se termine todo
Y no estoy seguro

Bertine Zetlitz,"I will wake up every night
Just in case and for no reason
It takes one to make things right
Innocence is out of season
If diamonds are forever

I will buy you fairy lights
Fairy lights will make you sit down
Trying hard to get this right
Should have held you close more often

So easy to be clever
So easy to be clever, no?

That is what I'd do if you were mine
I would keep you spared until the end of time
That is what I'd do if you were mine
I would keep you spared until the end of time

Sometimes I will let you go
That's the way to win you over
Saying yes when meaning no
I'll let it don a cover
If diamonds are forever

I would buy you fairy lights
Fairy lights will break you gently
It takes two to win a fight
Softened every blow you've sent me

So easy to say never
So easy to say never, no?

That is what I'd do if you were mine
Sugar, count my kisses til you're feeling fine
That is what I'd do if you were mine
Sugar, count my kisses til you're feeling fine

Bertine Zetlitz,"Keeping afloat after midnight
Using your favorite smile
Keeping it flowing round midnight
You're gonna drift for a while

Going too fast after midnight
You won't be able to choose
Water's too high around midnight
You know you're going to loose

Although you swear
That you will never ever ever loose control
I've seen you slipping baby, sliding
But I've never seen you fall

Keeping your cool after midnight
Leaving with faces you know
Keeping it cool after midnight
Busy, but taking it slow

Seeing your eyes after midnight
Makes me forget what I've lost
Hearing your voice around midnight
Gratefully paying the cost

And though you think that you will never ever ever
Loose your grip
I've seen you tripping, baby
Sliding, but I've never seen you slip

So easy to let go
Much easier I know
So easy to look back
So easy to keep track

I loved you for a while
I loved your weary smile
So easy to keep track
So easy to look back",Midnight,2006

'tell him I'm leaving'
Nice little note
Knew he'd be grieving
And if he'd speak in code,
I'd let him know what's on my mind
Surely alone, I will be beaming

You'll never let her go
And you'll never let her know
That you never let her go

Placed in the doorway

You would go that way

always be around to keep him safe

Sure she's got an eminent grace
Soon you see that every trace
Is gonna' lead right back to you

Surely she's been planning it all
Girls will often do when they call
They don't even bother to fall
They are easily seen through

I have seen her flushing her pills
She has got some eminent skills
Always came along for the thrills
It's all leading back to you

Money, where there's none to be found
She is always fooling around
Draggin' anyone with her down
You will never have a clue

Honey if you want to
I will take you dancing in the rain
You're my obsession

Honey if you'd like to
I will show you this is not in vain
My sweet regression

Honey you don't know her at all
Never know if she's gonna' call
Never know if she's gonna' stall
And then lead them back to you

Often you'll regret she is there
Often you'll forget why you stare
Even though you know it's not fair
And you're easily seen through

I will take you dancing in the rain
You're my obsession

Played your darkest card
Let it slip too far
Said my love was too demanding

Then you told me we were drowning
Deeply lost at sea
You were blaming me
Yeah you told me we were drowning, drowning

Then you asked me to stop shaking
Said I made it hard

Bertine Zetlitz,"Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside there was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain every beat of my heart
We got something going on

Tender love is blind it requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream that is what we are
No one in between how can we be wrong?
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

I can't live without you if the love is gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear this could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

The read on the speed meter says
You have to go to task in the city
Where people drown and people serve
Don't be shy
Your just deserve
Is only just light years to go

Me, my thoughts are flower strewn
Ocean storm, bayberry moon
I have got to leave to find my way
Watch the road and memorize
This life that pass before my eyes
Nothing is going my way

The ocean is the river's goal
A need to leave the water knows
We're closer now than light years to go

I have got to find the river
Bergamot and Vetiver
Run through my head and fall away
Leave the road and memorize
This life that pass before my eyes
Nothing is going my way

There's no one left to take the lead
But I tell you and you can see
We're closer now than light years to go
Pick up here and chase the ride
The river empties to the tide
Fall into the ocean

The river to the ocean goes
A fortune for the undertow
None of this is going my way
There is nothing left to throw
Of Ginger, lemon, indigo
Coriander stem and rose of hay
Strength and courage overrides
The privileged and weary eyes
Of river poet search naivete
Pick up here and chase the ride
The river empties to the tide
All of this is coming your way",Find the River,1992
Bertis Downs,"Monty, this seems strange to me
The movies had that movie thing
But nonsense has a welcome ring
And heroes don't come easy

Now nonsense isn't new to me
I know my head, I know my feet
But mischief knocked me in the knees
Said, ""just let go, just let go""

I saw the ocean meet the man
I saw you buried in the sand
A friend was there to hold your hand
Said, ""walk on by""

So, I went walking through the street
I saw you strung up in a tree
A woman knelt there said to me
Said, ""hold your tongue, hold your tongue""

You don't owe me anything
You don't want this sympathy (waste your breath)
Don't you waste your breath (waste your breath)
For the silver screen

That nonsense doesn't mean a thing
They tried to bust you in a sting
But virtue isn't everything
So, don't waste time

Now, here's a rhyme that you can steal
Put this on your reel to reel
Mischief threw a rotten deal
Monty's laying low, man
He is laying low
Just let go
Just let go

You don't want this sympathy (waste your breath)
Don't you waste your breath (waste your breath)

The photograph on the dashboard, taken years ago
Turned around backwards so the windshield shows
Every streetlight reveals the picture in reverse
Still, it's so much clearer
I forgot my shirt at the water's edge
The moon is low tonight

Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
I'm not sure all these people understand
It's not like years ago
The fear of getting caught
Of recklessness and water
They cannot see me naked
These things, they go away
Replaced by everyday

Nightswimming, remembering that night
September's coming soon
I'm pining for the moon
And what if there were two
Side by side in orbit
Around the fairest sun?
That bright, tight forever drum
Could not describe nightswimming

You, I thought I knew you
You I cannot judge
You, I thought you knew me

There are scratches all around the coin slot
Like a heartbeat, baby trying to wake up

Don't want to bring you down

it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know

 Oui, on pouvait en ce temps là

 Et ma Maman est très jolie

The lullaby of Broadway
The hip hooray and ballyhoo

The rumble of a subway train
The rattle of the taxis
The daffodils who entertain
At Angelo's and Maxi's

It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight
Until the dawn

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
Hey

The band begins to go to town
And everyone goes crazy
You rock a bye your baby round
'Til everything gets hazy
Hush a bye, I'll buy you this and that
You hear a daddy saying
And baby goes home to her flat
To sleep all day

And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one

-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet

Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye

 I could just keep on dancing forever dear with you

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

Because I'm nobody's baby now

Tried to go further but was out of fuel
Wanted to be with light and see
All the beauty was there for me
But had to pull over

Souls highway, souls highway tonight
My chance to reach the skies
Souls highway, souls highway tonight
This time I will be there
Souls highway, souls highway tonight
This time my life will end
Souls highway, souls highway tonight
This time my life will end

I had a taste from beyond
I wanted more but they took it away
I had to stay in this cold place
Instead of a life in eternal grace
Please let me go back

Souls highway, souls highway tonight
My chance to reach the skies
Souls highway, souls highway tonight
This time I will be there
Souls highway, souls highway tonight
This time my life will end
Souls highway, souls highway tonight
This time my life will end

Tired of all, tired of this world
Now it's time to try again
See the light increase the speed
And fly away

Souls highway, souls highway tonight
My chance to reach the skies
Souls highway, souls highway tonight
This time I will be there
Souls highway, souls highway tonight
This time my life will end
Souls highway, souls highway tonight
This time my life will end",Souls Highway,2002
Beseech,"[""This song is dedicated to Jennifer Berg that lost her world 00-05-28. Carry on even if it's hard, with love Klas""]

Give her love and protection
Give her all, all the things she need
Give her faith and a reason
Make her feel brighter than the sun

Tell her that she's special
Tell her that she's valuable
Carry on for tomorrow
Carry on even if it's hard

[Chorus]
Leave him in the sunset 28
To remember the moments in the sun
And the diamond that lost her world today
Will keep on shining brighter than the sun

Ease her pain and her guilts
Tell her that no one really knows
Help her find new solutions
Help her while she is still a child
Without no farewell
We will never forget the moments in the sun

Beseech,"You told me to walk your way
When I followed for that simple reason
Our fate was to stay
Together 'til our souls departed

Your will was my word
You tried to go against my speech
My word was you'd stay
Together 'til our souls departed

You had no choice
Was that my destiny
You belonged to me
In sickness and in health
I was your puppeteer
Was that the way it should be
Together 'til our souls departed

I would never change it
Not for anything in the dark world
Thank you for those days
I will keep them in the dark side of my mind

The day that you changed
I will condemn the day 'til I die
What about those words you said
Together 'til our souls departed

You had no choice
Was that my destiny
You belonged to me
In sickness and in health
I was your puppeteer
Was that the way it should be
Together 'til our souls departed

The rain clears my thoughts
I embrace it like the night I live in
I'm rather lost than possessed
You will learn the rules
This life is just a game we're playing
And we will lose
There is no way to move the pieces

You had no choice
Was that my destiny
You belonged to me

Beseech,"Today is the day
You reveal yourself to me
Please don't speak
Cause I'll greet you, I'll greet you with my kiss

I watched you from my corner
I felt your eyes from here
I knew that I adored you
When you heard, when you heard me say

Come on in, come on in to my world tonight
I want to feel you, feel your life through mine
Come on in, come on in to my world tonight
I want to see you, see your eyes catch the sun

Just think about all we will go through
It'll take time
A lifetime
A lifetime to proceed

I open my life wider
I crawl inside your skin
You make my body shiver
When you hear, when you hear me say

Beseech,"The light fades up in a brand new heart
First page of a manuscript
Not complete but full of life
A life that struggles on

Seems like the drama never ends
A there are still words untold
The easy parts seem so far away
So far away

My own play, my own play
The show has reached the end
The curtains closing down

Still alone on this stage
I've played my tragic parts
Now I'm just waiting for the end
The end that takes me away

Looks like the last page is reached
And the light is fading out
But the show must keep on going
And the show goes on

My own play, my own play
The show has reached the end
The curtains closing down",Drama,2004
Beseech,"These words doesn't seem real to me
What did you try to say
Somewhere you hide from me
I just cannot find out where

You left a letter
How could I tell
I know you can hear me
Forever I will
I try to reach you
But I still fall
Forever falling

I still can feel the touch of your lips
Caress and tease my skin
I close my eyes and drift away
I find my way back to you

You left a letter
How could I tell
I know you can hear me
Forever I will
I try to reach you
But I still fall
Forever falling

Without any words I left that world
I don't feel any regrets over the last decisions that I made
The pain I left behind me made a scar in my soul
That will last forever to remind me

You left a letter
How could I tell
I know you can hear me

Beseech,"One day I woke up to the light from the sun
I thought the night ghost were all gone
Felt that things weren't like they used to be
Waking with anxiety by my side

my heart, my soul everything's gone
Everything's gone
My heart, my soul everything's gone
Everything's gone

even the sun cannot light up the day
Everything seems to be without colours
Silence was the only thing I heard
Wanted to go back again

my heart, my soul everything's gone
Everything's gone
My heart, my soul everything's gone
Everything's gone

my heart, my soul everything's gone
Everything's gone
My heart, my soul everything's gone
Everything's gone

Beseech,"I can't resist nor refuse the thrill of lust you bring me
The contradictions taking me down
Down to the darker side of me

The insecurity is my fear
To loose a part of me
A pray of courage reaching my mind
Forgive me for my sins

Get down on your knees when I command
Lay back and take what's yours to have
I know exactly what to do
To reach a higher level of you

The feeling of loosing control
To do what you desire
Trembling from the shame you bring
You want to make me beg for more

Touch me, fill me do what you please
You're in control of me
The only things I hate to love
My god of pleasure

I wanted to feel that you belonged to me

Now I know that you were real
Hope you know how much I miss you
How could you push me that far

You manipulated my mind
Revealed the secrets that I hide
And I just had to keep you from them

I'll never forget somebody like you
I wanted to feel that you belonged to me

Didn't you get enough

Beseech,"All around I see what will come
Just a breeze from a raging storm

We are stained from the steps you've made

You wanted all you're walking alone
It's a bittersweet tragedy oohhh
You wanted all you're walking alone

I am blinded and fooled by fear
As puppets in a cold dark play
We are trapped inside a cage
Until this downward spiral ends

Beseech,"Love is a flame
A devil's thing
A violent storm
About to be born
Just look in these eyes
See all the lies

That burns inside
If you get too close
Burn you alive

Moving fast into the night

A screaming child what have I done
See the cold has gripped their spines
Turn around I'm not alone
Lost my faith I'm on my way

Things you've said
Things you've done 
When someone else controls your mind
You'll get worse before the end
You cannot feel you can just bleed
Cannot feel, can just bleed

Bleeding under cold street lights
People scream they're all afraid
Blame myself is this my fault
A growing seed of evil deeds
A sickness that's gone too far
Closing in, the chase is on
Turning back is not my choice
Lost my faith I'm on my way

There's a poor old mother at home
She's watching and waiting alone
Longing to hear from a loved one so dear
Just a picture from life's other side

Now the first scene is one of two brothers
Who had lost all of his money at play
One lived in luxury and riches
And the other went beg for his bread

One night they met on the highway
""Your money or lives, sir,"" they cried
Then with his knife took his own brother life
That's a picture from life's other side

Now the next scene is that by the river
A heartbroken mother and babe
In the harbor lights shine and they shiver
Outcast, soon no one will save

Once she was once a true woman
Somebody's darling and pride
God help her she leaps, there's no one to weep
That's a picture from life's other side

That's a picture from life's other side
Somebody has fell by the way
And a life has gone out with the tide
That might have been happy some day

I'm gonna do right by my Pa
Lay around the cabin door

What to see my old day tray
What to hunt the possum
Where the corn top blossom
On that blue ridge far away

I see a window with the light
I see two heads of snowy white
It seems I can hear them both recite
Where is my wondering boy tonight

Golden hair so soft and curly and her lips were like the dew
She was the queen of West Virginia and her name was Linda Lou

Linda Lou my Linda Lou can't you hear me calling you
Calling like a lonesome dove my Linda Lou
When the moon is in the blue and the stars are shining too
Can't you hear my lonely heart calling for you Linda Lou

I recall the night I met her how I held her hand in mine
I recall the night we kissed and bid adieu
Many miles may separate us if I should cross the ocean blue
My heart is still in West Virginia with my darling Linda Lou",Linda Lou,1991
Bessie Lee Mauldin,"What will the birds do, mother, in the spring
Will they gather the crumbs around our door
Will they fly from the nest to the top of the tree
And ask why Joe wanders out no more

What will the kitten do, mother, all alone
Will she stray from her frolic for a day
Will she lie on the rug beside my bed 
Like she did before I went away

What will Thomas, the old gardener do 
When you ask him for flowers for me
Will he give you a rose he has tended with care
The fairest one that lies around the tree

I saw the tears coming to his honest eyes
He said it was the wind that brought 'em there
As he gazed on my cheeks growing paler each day
His hand trembled over my hair

Keep Tag, mother, my little dog 
I know that he'll mourn for me too
Keep him though blind and older he grows
To sleep in the whole summer through

Show him my coat, mother, so he may know
That his master then will be dead
Speak to him kindly and often of Joe
And pat him on his brown shaggy head

And you, dearest mother, shall miss me for a while
But in heaven I shall no larger grow
And any kind angel you meet at the gate
Can take you to your darling Little Joe",Little Joe,1991
Bessie Lee Mauldin,"Oh yonder stands little Maggie
With a dram glass in her hands
She's drinking away her troubles
She's a courtin' some other man

Oh how can I ever stand it
Just to see them two blue eyes
A shinin in the moonlight
Like two diamonds in the sky

Last time a saw little Maggie
She was standin' on the banks of the sea
With a forty-four strapped around her
And a banjo on her knee

Lay down your last gold dollar
Lay down your gold watch and chain
Little Maggie's gonna dance for daddy
Listen to that old banjo ring

Pretty flowers were made for blooming
Pretty stars were made to shine
Pretty girls were made for lovin'

Bessie Lee Mauldin,"Where is the love that you promised 'neath the pine?
Gone like the flowers in the fall
You crossed your heart, now you're double crossing mine
You've been pretending after all

I was sold down the river to a port of broken dreams
Drifting in sorrow down the stream
Sold down the river on a ship that won't return
When it anchors in the sea of broken dreams

I never dreamed that your love would grow so cold
Hiding behind the rainbow's end
You must be blind for the glitter of the gold
Gold that can never find a friend

I was sold down the river on the port of broken dreams
Drifting in sorrow down the stream
Sold down the river on a ship that won't return
When it anchors in the sea of broken dreams

You'll never know what it means to sit and cry
After your heart is broken too
Someday you'll learn and your soul will burn and die
When some one double crosses you

I was sold down the river to a port of broken dreams
Drifting in sorrow down the stream
Sold down the river on a ship that won't return
When it anchors in the sea of broken dreams

Bessie Lee Mauldin,"We all loved our fair tender maiden
From her eyes the light of Heaven shone through
She fell sick one cold winter morning
And there was nothing we could do

She lay on her death bed so bravely
Her face all tired and worn
We knew in our hearts she was leaving
God had called her to His heavenly home

As she lay on the bed she was smiling
At the people all gathered a-round
It was her only way of saying goodbye
And tomorrow she'd lay neath the ground

The fragrance of flowers from her grave
Goes to heaven where she has gone too
Mortal pain shown on all our faces
But there was nothing we could do

His words rang out clear and true
He said God called her that's the reason
That there was nothing we could do",There Was Nothing We Could Do,1991

I think of love of yesterday
Now I know she's gone away

 That my love will never die
 Someday I'll walk along beside her
 On that golden way up there

Now all my life I lived so gaily
Until she had to go away
Then she left me oh so lonely
She lies at rest beneath the clay

We'll have life eternal there

And we sang our own love's refrain

Our romance seemed all in vain
The dark clouds are gone and there's blue skies again
Yes time changes everything

The time has passed and I have forgot you
Mother nature does wonderful things
I guess it is true for me and for you
Cause time changes everything

Rearrange it and make it swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you

I think you played the game right from the start

That toy broke and then we had to part
It never can be mended

Betchadupa,"I sit outside the theatre in the rain
The air is cool and hugging to my brain
From where I stand the ground before me lays
I'm in the rain
I cannot solve the riddle thing

Now I walk into my town's domain
The water drops to death into the drain
Believe me I will try the other way
But it is hard to motivate 
Me in the rain
Clouds of dark
And I am stuck
Here in the rain

Rain is falling on
Falling on the trees
And I can't have it all
Have it all my way

Now the sun is rising to my face
The air is warm
It might be getting late
The animals are out here once again
'Cause it is hard
To run away in the rain
Cannot think, I cannot talk, I can't explain

Rain is falling on
Falling on the trees
And I can't have it all
Have it all my way

Rain is falling on my face
Rain is falling on

I'm dead and you
Killed me

The words I can't repeat
The seat beside the tree
I hope you're there tonight

Aiming for your head, get down

You're the only one in town

Just like the record store
That I can't go no more

Betchadupa,"In Darkwell Lane there's bats in the sky tonight
They breathe the same
And we come to life at night
Our eyes become bright

Fly all the night
Sleep when its light

To circle for hours and hours
What's in their brains
But dreams of the sea, relief
Can we get some sleep

Fly all the night
Sleep when its light
Fly all the night
Sleep when its light

Betchadupa,"Well the reason that I
Have to spend the entire
Rest of my life making the most of my time
Being free from the man
Please you all if I can
Find it happens a lot
Breaking things when I'm not right
Move to the hill
From a chemical spill
Have a roof made of glass
And a house full of class
Be a mystery guy
Wear a shirt and a tie
'cause the rules don't apply
From the conts on the wrong side

Be out of your mind
All of the time
Drink up the wine
That's my design

Ignorance is the bliss
That's the way to exist
What else can we do
Sit in here watch the news
Or sing about war
Bang my head on the door
I'd rather help those around me
And hope that they're happy

Be out of your mind

Drink up the wine
That's my design

But I doubt that she saw me
'cause she couldn't see or talk
Or hear or have a thought
And I saw her in a dream
And we had a cup of tea
She said Liam would help me
I want to see the world
When you're asleep, then we will meet
Together we will learn

And all the world rained down on her
Well she was born with the diversions in her head
And all the world rained down on her
Well she was born with the diversions in her head
She don't even know I'm there

You taught me how to feel
The things that are not real
Now my skins more sensitive
And I have much more to give
And show you through my life
The happiness and strife
It seems much lighter now, as far as I can tell
But there's one thing that gets to me
But you can turn me round

And all my world rained down on her
She was born with the diversions in her head
If I showed you all I know, don't look at me
I know you have to go
And her brain stopped, I stopped dreaming
And her heart stopped, I stopped breathing
OOOOOOOOh, OOOOOOOOOOOh, I'm moving

But tday my melody will stay
Close to the shore where we drive

But it's gonna stay forever, and ever

The clouds are running out of rain
Its often late and often long
But I will wait for you for now

With the money that I made
Sold the rights to my play
Run to the beach
Where the salty air is sweet

'cause the ocean is the cure

Lost my name in the grain of sand
No worries still remain, let the water keep you sane

Where the salty air is sweet
Dance on the shore

And I wonder as time rolls by
After midnight the thunder is nice

His face is carved like a madman

Running out of time
There's nothing I can try
There's nothing I can try

Meet the man underwater
He's sitting down on the sulphur
He took the track on the wrong side
Now he's in for the long ride
Several robberies
I'm told I saw the crime
You said it's up to me and that's fine

Running out of time
There's nothing I can try
There's nothing I can try
Running out of time
There's nothing I can try

Dishes from the dinner last night
The silence grips me by the window
Waiting for the time to come
I wanted to hear the sound
By now I'm sure you get the picture
Seems like there is some meaning inside
Four hours standing in the same room
Waiting for the time to pass
I wanted to hear the sound of the motorway

She's gonna make it home for the weekend
Thank you for that
And if I'm tired when you get there
I'll blame you for that
'cause I've been waiting for such a long time
To hear your footstep
So please get home for the weekend
Thank you for that

I clean up mainly just to kill time
And to make the kitchen look nice
This waiting mixed with all this boredom
Makes me feel like I could die
Waiting to hear the sound of the front door

You better make it home for the weekend
Thank you for that
And if I'm tired when you get there
I'll blame you for that

Move over and over, over again

This feeling when I'm sober, sober again
I get up, but the pain rushes to my head
So move over, I've gone back to bed
Move over and over again

Last night in my eyes,
You were so good to me
I knowyou get hurt by my simplicity
The last thing I recall,
I've got no memory
So move over and over
Move over and over, over again

You don't know what you are doing man

When the peacemaker's time is at hand

To never become our own foe
And light one candle for those who are suffering
Pain we learned so long ago
Light one candle for all we believe in
That anger not tear us apart
And light one candle to find us together
With peace as the song in our hearts

Don't let the light go out!
It's lasted for so many years!
Don't let the light go out!

That we keep it alive in that flame?
What's the commitment to those who have died
That we cry out they've not died in vain?
We have come this far always believing
That justice would somehow prevail
This is the burden, this is the promise
This is why we will not fail!

Aprendemos muito nesses anos
Afinal de contas não tem cabimento
Entregar o jogo no primeiro tempo

Nada de correr da raia
Nada de morrer na praia
Nada! Nada! Nada de esquecer

No balanço de perdas e danos
Já tivemos muitos desenganos
Já tivemos muito que chorar
Mas agora, acho que chegou a hora
De fazer valer o dito popular

It's a sorry sight
Let it all deceive

Pains in me that I've never found

That we hope to achieve
What we can
What we will

The bitter note unsung
Running
Trying to find salvation
From the sorrow that is done

For the life of me
Will the sorrow rise
For this under
Underlies all I see

For time is but a memory
Beautiful for some
Feathered like a majorette
In a rose unsaid and done

Moments
Like a rainbow colored sky
How they come and go
They come and go but why

For unknown
Is our fortune
And our fortune won't let go

And our faith it will die with the sun
It will lie
Underneath
All will see

Feathered like a majorette
In a rose unsaid and done

All for our future
And our future won't let go",Spider Monkey,2002

Or turn us into thangs off Thriller, or dang gorillas?

In the name of greed we in a seedless society
Flounder genes in your tomatoes
Cod in your potatoes, playin' God, retarded'er than Plato
And as the juice gets sweeter
No use in bein' cute if you's a useless eater
Make it hard to keep your mattress clean
That was mean, little froggies with sex changes from atrazine
And aspartame in gum, Splenda is plenty fun

Or ride on, forgot the silent guide stone

Could you hear me calling

Would you say I'm falling
If I told you the truth would you
Stay

If I whisper my thoughts, would you hear the chanting of my heart?
Phrasing melodies unsung in the dark.
Saying hold me through the night.

Hear the music from my room, calling out to you.
Come home to me soon.
Shadows bellowing duets with the moon, singing hold me through the night.
Hold me through the night, hold me through the night.

And the water drop in the drain, just like the sound it makes You're coming round again.
There's a soft piano in a warm summer's rain playing hold me through the night, hold me through the night, hold me through the night. Hold me, hold me through the night. Oh ya gotta hold me through. Ya gotta hold me through the night, hold me through the night.

To a little old town without a name 

She met a man he took her in 
But fed her all the same bullshit again

He lied like a salesman sellin' flies

I think I'll send around some pie 
I'll spike that dish with a touch of herb

From my beautiful mother
I'm not gonna go there
I'm anything other

When the stars ain't shining bright

When those candle light of home
Burn so very far away

Hey now people don't mind

Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.

Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,

I don’t let it overwhelm me
I know that joy will be there

And buy me a drink

He says “who ya fooling?
I know your type!!

Beth Hirsch,"""Never been here, how about you?""
You smile at my answer,
You've given me the chance,
To be held and understood.

You leave me laughing without crying,
There's no use denying,
For many times I've tried,
Love has never felt as good.

Be it downtown or way up in the air,
When your heart's pounding,
You know that I'm aware.

You make it easy to watch the world with love,
You make it easy to let the past be done,
You make it easy.

How'd you do it? 
How'd you find me?
How did I find you?
How can this be true?
To be held and understood.

Keep it coming, no one's running
The lesson I'm learning
'Cause blessings are deserved
By the trust that always could

Be it downtown or way up in the air,
When your heart's pounding,
You know that I'm aware.

You make it easy to watch the world with love,
You make it easy to let the past be done,
You make it easy.

You make it easy to watch the world with love,
You make it easy to let the past be done,
You make it easy.",You Make It Easy,1998
Beth Hirsch,"Come a day I'll walk this earth
Where steps are taken sure
Come a day though it seem far away
Lines that bind are pure
Had to find it
No way round it
Quick sand had a chance...
So come, come on, come a day
Your eyes are where i'm right at home
Come a day though it seem far away
Stare bears love from stone
Gentleness is what precedes
Before and past the deed
Unafraid of caves and cobwebs
Shade can fade the hate
Time won't let you deny
Time will kiss you goodbye
We will leave you alone
We will leave you
Time extends you a hand
Time defends your command
We will leave you alone
We will leave you

Evening by the river
Stands a man
A man and Gabrielle

Real looker
Her back began to shiver
Reminders of the months
Under his spell

He spoke in measure
She recognized his rhythm
Been a year
A year without a sound

She saw it comin
In gestures he delivered
Her eyes just kept
The ground....

Has learned to tell
The gap from
False to real

And needs a man
Who's sane at hand
In tenderness
Revealed

Can you understand me?
The pace I'm making
Cause I'm a changed man

(i was) such a fool
In how I used to trat you
Such a fool
To beat you out of life

Gone the days
I leave you with no traces
Gone the day
You hate to see my face

I know it's late
I sweat and hesitate
Wouldn't it
Be great?

Cause Gabrielle
I mean you well
And we have healed
In time

For all the girls
In all the world
It's you I seek
To find, Gabrielle¡°

She stood dazed
Nude in amazement
She heard his words
A hundred times again

A fantasy has haunted her
For ages
That fantasy had now become
Her friend

She came upon
An earring in the street
Tearful pearl
With silver to the sides

She finally won
Her walk became a run
She felt as she
Could fly

Has learned to tell
The gap from
False to real

In here's the fan
Who'll meet the man
Cause love is
Strength revealed

Captain
Could you feed me
'Cause I'm starving for some Daylight

Poor me
Always falling
Now I'm calling you to take flight
My head is a court

For the darkness
While needles go straight
For the joint
I can't seem to win

Many games here
In fact, I've forgotten
The point
Go way

Go out
Lady !
If you see the lady
Tell her that I'm alright

Better not yet
Cause she's buney
To the phone and 
Does she wear her reasoning

Skintight
'Cause moonlight can read
In a heart beat
Where you and now me

Chose to be
Take hold of the cold
And the pressure
The force of her truth

Is the key

Captain, 
I'm ready, you can send me back

A full moon
I was born there
I was graceful
I was steady, you know ?

Combed enough your hives to
Differentiate the kinds
Oh, the turns that take these tables
Our cards face up mark down into
Then changes crack the frame like thunder

Who's to say it we're too happy
Who will tell, not I
Wrestling this devil for I swear
The final time
Oh, discouraging illusion

If panic never made us blunder

And curse this magic
Etched in Hindsight

To yourself ""Oh well, but fuck, 
Then again"", just hum, I'm sure

And turned up high
When you don't expect it
Heat's the best surprise

Waiting to be used

Time for lunch
Time to set the table

You couldn't leave
Neighbors in your skin
Sifted through the lease

A couple's chance
To fall into a trance?

Can a laugh begin
The where within
To start a new romance?

Can arms so strong
Be placed along
The place where we belong?

Can a body melt?
I'd never felt, I'd never known
Til I met you

Can the doubt that's creeping
While you're sleeping
Program it to lose?

Can love or hate
That's risked your fate
Suffice to pay your dues?

Can a tear increase
The fears release
in helping you to choose?

Love had only seemed
A taunting dream
I'd never know
Til I met you

Some days are over
But some are right here
To wink you in the eye

A memory pleases
Before it teases
Out to make you cry

So in the long run
You'll be your one gun
It's do or die
And then I met you
Oh, why

Can a thought get caught
In what it oughtn't't
Dressing you in green?

Can jealous monster
Come to haunt 
Creating y'all a scene?

Can trust surpass
The many passes
No doubt come to pass?

Can the good persist?

Shaping their kinds of words
To say the same thing
Aching to wall with our backs straight

No matter how many times
You think you're ready

I thing it'd be really good
If I could be honest with you
Instead of acting like
In this I'm pleased

But I'm busy
Putting myself so far behind you
Instead of hanging right here
In the lead

Who said I wouldn't want to?

Different shades of love
Searching any kind of love
To know the one love
Aching to lie on our backs straight

No matter
Darling, I think it'd be
Searching any kind of love
To know the one love
Aching to lie on our backs straight

No matter
Darling, I think it'd be really good
If we could keep on doing  what we're doing

'Cause in the moment it's giving
Everything we own
Somehow in the next
I'm freed

Beth Hirsch,"After all jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red

And the wind whispers Mary

A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife

And the wind, it cries Mary

The traffic lights they turn a blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life that they lived is dead

And the wind screams Mary

Will the wind ever remember?
The names it has blown in the past
And with its crutch, its old age and its wisdom
It whispers ""no, this will be the last""

And the wind cries Mary",Everybody Loves the Sunshine,2006

Together darling, we'll keep some damn good company
For without trying, you make a seasoned fool of me
Your hands have folded, and twisted my dry-lock design
But honest darling, I'll be fine

Come forth and I will raise
Four flags above this day
Contain the night in arms

Titans rising, and all once vitals now implodes
Above your mantel, your equine ornaments erode
Relieve this moment, say that gestures don't afford
The lacquered tip of cupid's sword

Thou shalt not daunt me, though the wounds may still remain
You will not haunt me, or pass my sorry heart again
