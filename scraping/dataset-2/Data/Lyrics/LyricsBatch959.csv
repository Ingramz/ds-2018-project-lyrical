Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

In all our trials born to be our friends. 
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger, 
Behold your King! 
Before him lowly bend! 
Behold your King! 
Before him lowly bend! 

Truly He taught us to love one another, 
His law is love and His gospel is peace. 
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother. 
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

With all our hearts we praise His holy name.

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1996

Miserere, miserere,
Miserere, misero me,
Pero brindo alla vita!

Ma che mistero, e la mia vita,
Che mistero!
Sono un peccatore dell'anno ottantamila,
Un menzognero!
Ma dove sono e cosa faccio,
Come vivo?
Vivo nell'anima del mondo
Perso nel vivere profondo!

Io sono il santo che ti ha tradito
Quando eri solo
E vivo altrove e osservo il mondo
Dal cielo,
E vedo il mare e le foreste,
Vedo me che...
Vido nell'anima del mondo
Perso nel vivere profondo!

Se see'e una notte buia abbastanza
Da nascondermi, nascondermi,
Se see'e una luce, una speranza,
Sole maginifico che splendi dentro me
Dammi la gioia di vivere
Che anchora non see'e!

Miserere, miserere,
Quella gioia di vivere
Che forse ancora non see'e.

Day would not become night
Wouldn't feel this cold inside

Nothing can come between us, 
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.

When I caught a glimpse of Rita, 
Filling in a ticket in her little white book. 
In a cap she looked much older, 
And the bag across her shoulder 
Made her look a little like a military man.
 
Lovely Rita meter maid, 
May I inquire discreetly, 
When are you free to take some tea with me. 
Took her out and tried to win her, 
Had a laugh and over dinner, 
Told her I would really like to see her again

Got the bill and Rita paid it, 
Took her home I nearly made it,

When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing

I find it all so amusing

Royal T,"Another day, I cruise at the beach
Car sitting low, my homey's in the next seat
It's the Royal, rims clean with the top back
Rep for summer with the locs and the baseball hat
Down 805, cuties in the next lane
Trying to draw attention, their number and their name
We didn't get no play we got ignored
But there's too many cuties in the sea to fish for
I pulled up in the spot in the parking lot
Sipping on a 40 at the corner 'cause it gets hot
Cutties checking out the cars that we roll
Black candy with the rims with the booms and the gold
Here comes the pigs, turn it down they're getting nearer
Checking out the vatos with the dice in the mirror
But we ain't villains that be stepping out of line
We like going cruising with the cutties in the summertime

From the coast to the avenue
Our crew is deep, I thought you knew
Hitting switches in my 64
Baby don't you know
We be rolling

From the coast to the avenue
Our crew is deep, I thought you knew
Hitting switches in my 64
Baby don't you know
We be rolling

I said trucks rolling by with the boom-booms in em
I sling Sly shirts with the Levi denim
A late night tings in after day time
Vatos looking loco, hynas looking fine
The veterano's got the switches to the side
The truck's full of amps in the back of the g-ride
Everybody's styling, Profile's Low
I'm driving real slow, looks like a big car show
I peep the cutties with the light Brown complection
Gotta bust a you and go the opposite direction
Pina Coloda, room at the Ramada

Parties at the beach if it gets any hotter
Cholos in bandanas, nobody's down to bang
Let the rags hang, it's a Mexican thang
We ain't villains that be stepping out of line
We like going cruising with the cutties in the summertime

From the coast to the avenue
Our crew is deep, I thought you knew
Hitting switches in my 64
Baby don't you know
We be rolling

From the coast to the avenue
Our crew is deep, I thought you knew
Hitting switches in my 64
Baby don't you know
We be rolling

Cooling by the shore, hynas cooling in the sand
Lotion in their hand with a summertime tan

I said homies kicking back in the shade drinking brew
Have one or two, but they're down to drink a few
Too many drinks when the evening arrive
Pass the keys to the homey, it ain't safe to drink and drive

Four five burning, sea breeze blowing
Ladies dress sexy, body half showing
Trying to draw attention, Latino had I mentioned
Pack in the glove, don't forget about prevention
When we hit the motel it's almost 1 o'clock
Everything closed so we head to Heidi's Taco Shop
Cutties want to roll, the lab is where we sent em
Taking em to the room, we did the wild thing with em
But we ain't ones to wine and dine
I'd rather cruise at the beach with the cutties in the summertime
From the coast to the avenue
Our crew is deep, I thought you knew
Hitting switches in my 64

Another day at the spot where the homies be chilling
Thinking of how we're gonna make our next million
On the Westside of town, keep it real, keep it Brown
Ain't a hater alive that could hold us down
'cause we're out here trying to make these chips daily
You ask us can you get some, homey you must be crazy
We had to work for ours, that's how we got these cars
That's why we pack this metal, we're some ghetto superstars
Only thing we're giving up is that funk you can bump in the trunk
All day everyday, Westside holiday, what more do I gotta say
You want to mess with us, I'll say homey not today
'cause we ain't taking it and we ain't faking it
Just three wheel motion and pancaking it
Front and back, side to side
I roll one up for the world but I smoke it for the Westside

Can't nobody do it
Like the way we do it
On the Westside
'cause all we want to do
Is get you in the groove

Now who's that vato in the 600, blunted
It's the Royal homey, America's Most Wanted
Sancho, with a spanish fly in my cup
Checking out the cuties that are ghetto star-struck
From the 619 to the 213, oh you heard of me
That lead player Royal T
With my one night stands, got all the freaks talking
Latin pimp walking, let my game do the talking
My universal game makes the whole world turn
But some of you players move slow like sherm
And some of you freaks are like revolving hoes
'cause you always come back like revolving doors
Keep it Low Profile, never change my style
This heavyweight player'll make you throw in the towel
Everyday all day, that's how we play
On the Westside of Cali it's a player holiday

[Chorus]
[Frank V]
We're on a paper chase, yeah we roam on the chrome
But no matter how far we go we always come home
To the West 'cause it's the best
We only mess with that bombay everyday not the stress
So if you want to kick it be cool not a fool
So you can leave in your 64 rag not a body bag
'cause if you want to trip we can trip on
So don't slip 'cause if you do I got a grip on
Something awful and it's unlawful
Ruin your hair, I'd rather put it away and cruise off in my Chevrolet
Worry free, no pigs can't worry me
I got my warrants clear so pass me the beer
And I'll kill it as the sun sets with the vets
And the hynas from the ave, with no regrets
Represent the Brown Pride so relax and take a ride
With a few homies from the Westside

In my neighborhood it's all good, the homies are deep
I got a four-o and more, I'm getting high and it's all on me
Gangster'd out, no doubt, mobbing saying fuck it
Still rolling hella deep with the homies in a bucket
I ain't giving a fuck, I started with the gang
My homies are here and they got my back
I'm drinking a brew, I'm smoking a sack
I'm blowing to the brain and I'm sporting all black
Ese don't you know I bang Sureno, I'm a fool too
Mobbing with the homies loading cuetes saying fuck you
Drinking, smoking, and busting lines of coke too
Dancing, freaking, and fucking all night long
On a regular basis, all to the grill, fuck at the pad then off to the hood
Drinking a brew and acting a fool, once again ese I thought you knew

I let a shot in the air, 'cause where it falls I just don't really care
I ride till the wheels fall off and they ain't gonna fall off
Rolling with a pistol grip sawed off
Bang once and my name's been out
Crazy gangster representing the South
Westside what I'm talking about, Old Town what I'm talking about
Kill him and I'm finna bust that shit
Coming through with fifteen and a clip
You thought that Maniac would slip
Never me, and life's a bitch
'cause strapped with extra clips, air fifteen with a grip of Smiths
West on mine, six to the spine, aiming to delete on mines
619 down to bust a rhyme
Rest In Peace Speedy, I keep you on my mind
It was no doubt your cats are in the mix
Leave us two alone and we're coming up on shit

And I'm coming around with a magical spell so

Picture any toon blazing up at the moon
Your time is up, now you die from a bloody wound
That's what's gonna happen everytime I come attacking
I'm thinking of the weapon and the bodies I be stacking
On a mission, I'm packing my ammunition
I'm sticking these sons of bitches for snitching like bitches motherfucker
What you want to do, are you afraid

I have been searching for you lately
I've been wounded and from what I hear
You have the remedy

They told me You would be for me
So now I need to know
Is this a love that can save me
Or say You will then don't
Will You stay with me when nobody is around
If this is real, then tell now

Can you hold me together
Can your love reach down this far
Can you hold me together
Cause without You holding my heart
I'm falling apart
Falling apart

Saying so long, been lost, been gone
Not sure what to pray
It's not easy but I know You see me
When I lose my way

I keep on floating not knowing
If there is more for me
Don't want to sink beneath waves of negativity

I'm going under,
I'm afraid that I might drown
If this is real,
I need you now

Can you hold me together
Can your love reach down this far
Can you hold me together
'Cause without You holding my heart
I'm falling apart, yeah
Falling apart
Oh, Lord

I'm feeling stronger
With you by my side
And I realize You are my hope
I need to know

Can you hold me together
Can your love reach down this far
Can you hold me together
'Cause without You holding my heart
I'm falling apart,
Falling apart, yeah
Hold me together Lord

Without You,
I'm falling apart

Royal Tailor,"When you're knocked down to the bottom
And you feel like you're still falling
And you're wondering when the brighter day's coming
You've been lost
They keep playing that old sad song on the radio
And you feel like they're telling your story
You're like a ship that's floating in the dark
And the fog's so thick you can hardly see the stars anymore
And you're looking for a way
You're looking for a way home

Hope He'll light the way
You'll find your way to
Hope, hope
Everybody's looking for, they're searching for
A place to put their
Hope, hope

This life is a struggle
And you're so far 'cause you've been running
And you put trust in all of the wrong things
High class, you've got everything
It won't last, you'll be empty 'cause
True love's not marked with a price tag
No, you can't buy that
You're like a ship that's floating in the dark
And the fog so thick you can hardly see the stars anymore
And you're looking for a way
You're looking for a way home

I can see it in your eyes
You've been looking for a better life
But you don't where to find it
Well get ready, I can see the rising sun
And your change is 'bout to come
Yeah, your change is coming",Hope,2011
Royal Tailor,"Henry, you've been waiting and now this day has arrived
Why did it take the rock bottom to make you realize
What you've been missing is something that's very valuable
A timeless gift that will ease your mind and rapture your soul 
Look with your heart, not your eyes, you'll see the miracle
That hope is here and it's making itself available
This is your chance
If you miss it then you may miss it all
It's critical

My mouth just keeps on running
But I never follow through
I heard that true religion is love with hands and feet
I wanna find my own way
To reach a world in need
I've been captured by the unimportant
Locked in and now it's time to break free

There's more to life
Open my eyes
Someone is needing you
So I gotta make a move
What good are words
When this world hurts
Real faith will come through
When I make a move

We don't need permission to go outside of these doors
And dream some crazy dream
No one else has dreamed before
To show love and compassion
Whatever way it may be
To put faith into action
Do more than just believe

We were made to make a difference
Made to make a difference

Run to love
'Cause love, love waits for us
Waits for us with open arms

iPod and my headphones on

This hunger in my soul

That my identity
Is more than what they see
It's in the One who came to set me free
So I can be who I wannabe

Twisted into something that it's not

The storm stayed out in the valley
Think of all the rain that we been missing
You might say anything to anyone, but you still jump back
At the black cat hissing

When you're gonna get sent down alone

Why you gonna raise your hand to make the pickup

No keys, no chains, waiting in the kitchen all night long

Reverse the shade, fill your pockets up with hair and teeth and straw

That didn't sound like the thrashing of the wing of a bird

All that dirt can make you vain
But after everything they out you through

Like a flower forced to bloom
Before the sun hits the ridge
And here you come walking up with a smile
They don't believe you

How could you explain? It couldn't seem right
But f you stare at the sun long enough through a hole
You can almost believe you've gone blind

Everything that you tried to explain",Sweet Sixteen,1997

""No you left it behind the bed in Santa Fe,""
He said ""I'll send it right over"".

Royal Trux,"Russell watched room twenty seven from across the courtyard
Linda Rolla was inside she was about to come down hard
He ran a hydroponic farm, not that everybody knew
Linda'd run out with the money
And his harvest, too
Well dah-dah-dah, and dah-dah-dee
In twenty seconds it was over,
That's how Russ got the seeds

Thirty trucks from seventeen states
Move out staggered through the night
It's a tough job but temporary
And whoever blows the shit that Russ
Grows
Won't try to escape
And when they realize they're stranded here
They'll eat everything 
That gets thrown on their plate

Linda'd opened the connection with Doctor Henry last year
When he explained about the seeds, she could tell he was sincere
He'd been toiling down in Roswell for the E.T.I.
Who came to renovate this prison back in 1945
Linda believed and so would receive
Twenty pounds of Roswell seeds for
Getting Doctor Henry out
But ha-ha-ho, and fee fie fo
Russell broke in on the party and the deal went south

Canned meat still costs more than electrolytes
The pilot blanked in mid flight
Goats are trying to eat the plants
I'm laying out on the rug again
Watching the satellite until there's no chance

Russell waited for two months after Linda Rolla died
When no one came to question him
He wasn't surprised
There was a strange sensation in him
That he'd recognized
Knowing if he stopped production he'd be reoccupied
What can I say? Sometimes it's better to pay
In the luxury of keeping this behind your eyes",Roswell Seeds and Stems,1999

Your every wish is my command
All you gotta do is wiggle your little hand
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet

I'm just a toy, just a funny boy
That makes you laugh when you're blue
I'll be wonderful, do just what I'm told
I'll do anything for you
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet

Pull them little strings and I'll sing you a song, I'm your puppet
Make me do right or make me do wrong, I'm your puppet

I'm hanging on a string, I'll do anything now

We were like children posing
Playing at games, acting out names
Guessing the parts we played

Oh what a hit we made
We came on next to closing
Best on the bill, lovers until
Love left the masquerade

Fate seemed to pull the strings
I turned and you were gone

That music box played on

Song of my heart's composing
I hear it still, I always will

Royce Campbell,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1999

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

What I was missing, all that time in England 

Has sent me aimlessly, 
On foot or by the help of transportation, 
To knock on windows where 
A friend no longer live, I had forgotten. 

(chorus) 

And everywhere I go, 
There's always something to remind me 
Of another place and time 
Where love that travelled far had found me. 

We stayed outside til two, 
Waiting for the light to come back, 
But hid in talk I knew, 
Until you asked what I was thinking. 

(chorus) 

Brave men tell the truth, 
A wise man's tools are analogies and puzzles, 
A woman holds her tongue, 
Knowing silence will speak for her. 

So now I'll never know, 
As you will only sleep beside me, 
And everywhere I go...

What I was missing all that time in England

Calling me
In my head
Repeatedly

What is that visionary sight?
Before my eyes
So prominent
So mesmerizing, turbulent

You've got a hold on me
Your ingenuity
Seems to be driving me down on my knees

The force you generate
You reinvigorate
Your body talks and overstates

Well, I'm already drawn
Close to the divine
Intoxicating images are rushing through my mind

Embodiment of sin
Has kindled me within
Sensations seems to multiply, they're building up inside

Cutting through the night
Radiating light
I've seen you move the crowd
I know what you're about

The stories I have heard
The talk about excess
I know what people say
But surely you impress

Charismatic pill
You elevated sun
Vanity and pride
Added into one

A universal force
An autonomic high
A thing I can't control
No matter how I try

What have you done to me?
This candid chemistry
Emotions running over me

And when you arch your back
Just with a stare like that
Well, it's natural to interact

I'm not holding back
Ready to commence
Caught up in your blizzard so confusing and intense

Synergy of two
Energy gone wild
See the stars align to spell your name out in the sky

Never seen a sight
So fascinating right
A symmetry between
Dirty and pristine

Calling out so loud
Beautiful and true
Mystery about
Everything you do

Charismatic drug
You elevated sun
Vanity and pride
Added into one

A universal force
An autonomic high
A thing I can't control
No matter how I try

This electricity
Injected into me
Emotions running over me

And when you're getting close
You touch my innermost
A feeling deep inside me knows

Wonders of delight
Cutting through the night
Know you've got it all
I can't do without

Burning in my veins
Ripping through my soul
I'll never be the same
A secret can't be told

would throw their cape around each corner of the grassy fields
And one by one each huge shade would color the green with black
Allowing changes that we could not have foreseen

Everybody let us gaze upon the world we've created
Let us rest our eyes upon the great machine as we wave goodbye
Feel the evening breeze caress us while the cities are dying
As we watch it fall into a modern state, a modern time

Remember when we'd hear the distant sound of human life
A zillion noises whimper as they travel through the sky
And one by one each new sound has faded away with time
Allowing changes that we could not have foreseen

Everybody let us say goodbye to all our notions
Cause it's not enough to say that we're humane when we're left behind
It's too late to think that we can worship human emotions
Cause we've already evolved into machines in our minds

And your heart is just exploding and you look at them and it's just like
So I sing it like:
Wake me up in the morning with a kiss and make me some breakfast
And in the evening a candlelight dinner
Or when I feel restless
Give me a soft massage and my neck starts to tingle
Even when we didn't have anything you still made me feel like your queen
Now crystal and their glass is clean
Sleeping on on the floor,
You know what I mean
And I love you because you hold me down
When the world thinks I'm brave you see my frown
I love to be loved like this and I love and I love your kiss
So thankful
Yeah this is all I was trying to say to you:

You make me fall in love again
And I am so glad you chose me yeah
You make me fall in love again
All over and over again

Your like my angel
Perfect for me, that's all I ever wanted you to be
Understand when you said that you loved me
What kind of man would I be if I told you I loved you constantly
You probably wouldn't believe me because your frontin like you don't even need me
Still I just wanted to tell, wanted to tell
You are my wife, my lover, my sister, I'm your brother

But it was all the Outz, we dressed up as Martians
When I, crack a brew it's nuttin' else I'd rather do
Hop out a cab or two to your avenue to battle you
Your style get ate like italian steak
Then I get Red to sell you achey or a pound of shake
Y'all can open up wide and suck this dick
None of y'all niggaz can't fuck with Bricks
While you scrubbin' dishes, we puffin Swishers
Fuckin' women ends up in the Benz trunk with switches
We cop sixty-three nigs
One from every spot, blunts be mystery mix
We got, spots, all my niggaz stay in Bricks
While y'all stash clips in bags of Bar-B-Q potato chips
Plus your main honey loved us
Slip her some bom-ba she'll fuck twenty of us

Yo, you pack that little ass gun like Harlem Nights
After we brawl and fight, yo bitch I'ma ball tonight
At shows we so tight we flow like it's one mic
Raw underground, yo Don, tell em what that dough like

D. Don, I gets mine, and stay gettin' it
My thug mind'll brawl with rhymes and stay shittin' it
Check my shine, iced out platinum like your pendant
V.I.P. ghetto nigga, hustlin' and spendin'
Got bitches trickin' tryin' to get with me
Got police, flock niggaz tryin to cop from me
How many pouns you want, how many pounds you need?
I cultivate, every block I go and drop seeds nigga
I grow trees, niggaz know me, for bein' low key
That hustler from A.C.

I'm steady shittin' on hoes, Grand Royal like the Green Eyed Bandit
Jump straight in the Lex offa New Jersey transit
Let my man spit that Don shit
Gov-Matic spit that shit that's toxic, I rock shit
It's that hot shit like Busta Bust got
Plus I bust glock, on pussies I trust not
They get blown, burned like minutes on cell phone
Bring the terror to your block like the toughest nigga from jail home
And you dead gone when my squad come around
We hella illa from Isabella to Downtown",Boohdah Break,1998
Roz,"Hey man, hey man, yeah go 'head with that man
Just rhymin over here man
Hey go 'head, go get drunk nigga
Ayyy, go smoke yo' weed nigga
Yo, go drink yo' forty motherfuckaaaah
It's Brick City dawgs over here
We gon' take it down like this, yo, D-Don, Don..

[D-Don]
It's bone-afficial my nizzle
D-Don got issues, and a type team that dismiss you
Oh boy! I gets more +Chips+ than +Ahoy!+
I got toys that deploy, I just aim and destroy
I keeps it gully in a bonafide skully
I ain't never had a hit but still get props like Nelly
I'm platinum in streets I got, love in the streets
And I'm more underground than your, basement concrete
Braids in my hair, gold still in my teeth
Still, bringin the beef if you're, bringin me grief
I, rat-a-tat-tat it like one-two one-two
Cock my shit back and let off on your whole crew
I'm Brick City baby twenty-fo'/seven
A project nigga that's, tryin to see heaven
I done ran through hell with gasoline drawers on (AOWW!)
I'm the portrait of a hustler, and once again it's on
I still got money buried in my back yard
I'm Bumpy like Johnson, they call me D-Don
My shit's so dope when you smoke you nod
And I spit that shit that leave you holy like the song

[Pacewon]
Yo.. we from the place where they pump out D and steal cars
Kids wild wave at you and smile you feel large
like they cut, and you got the power to heal scars
Never down cause the underground crown is still large
See I rap for a livin, probably rap 'til I die
If you dope, where you been at? Your raps is a lie
I'm all real, the one, the raw deal
Do tour, come home, do a flick for four mill'
What the hardcore heads on the block would call ill
Never catch me at the ball-out spot with small bills
Innovative rapper, rhyme in new ways
When I spit niggaz cough up blood for two days
Never catch me with material girls, they fugaz'
Rather bounce with a short chickenhead in blue shades
'Til the day I'm rich like Bruce Wayne
I'ma kick raps like pimps blew game
Ridin through your block with six new chains on
Pullin over droppin H-bombs
No doubt I got it locked Sanford Ave. to Penn Station
Chancellor to Central a thousand men waitin

[Chorus - 2X w/ minor variations]

You heard me light the Dutch (smokin weed)
Rock on like what the fuck (what the fuck?)
Jersey that's whassup, Brick City

[Roz]
Fuckin with me is a close call out of my crew
Don't try it I fuckin roast why'all, you and your co-stars
Next up to bat, I done had enough of cats
Blast tracks like what the fuck was that?
Roz spit rawness
State to state, hood streets and block corners
Rhymes hold so much weight, the feds on us
Lot of niggaz didn't want to see me last
But I won't stop just slow down like Easy Pass
Back up and give the are room
Or we gon' brawl worse than cartoons in bar rooms
In my city they don't pop they collar
Cats that do, get shot drop and holla
I'm from the be	-are-I, see-K-S
And my, squad is hot, any beef they bless
Any, squad that test gon' meet they death
Ask yourself, do you really need that stress?

[Shooga Bear]
Aiyyo, I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door, no bitin allowed
Plus the blows that I throw bring a light in the sound
So whoever want the drama I'm invitin them now
Phenomenal shit, spit 'til my abdominal split
Plus combined lines so minds demolish a click
Still burn MC's like Everclear, never fear
With razor sharp skills so ill they, sever ears
Hard to the roots a hundred proof with no chaser
Scarves and some boots a hundred troops with chrome bangers
Now rock with me, I spray blocks with glock fifties
Still when I spit I flip like Spock sent me
And never gave a fuck what a rapper grossed
But if they, brag and boast I'ma clap the toast
why'all can analyze this, watch me paralyze clicks
And sabotage why'all, I ain't a fan of why'all shit

[Double O]
I'm a nasty ass disease, and now I got ya mouth celibate
I'm a direct descendant of Hannibal's elephants
That's word to mother, them damn jokes is over
You gon' run your mouth like a motor 'til I fuck up the rotor
It's Double O again, still runnin, still gunnin
It's like I got a cast-iron dick, I'm still cummin
Talkin that killer shit like you blood raw
And ain't even did ten minutes in the back of a squad car
Be big niggaz to they weak, I'm true to the streets
why'all niggaz is half-assed like one booty cheek
I'm (??), why'all is Swiss Miss
My camp'll make your army pull back like a slipped disc
It be the Bricks again, with me with them steel rods
It ain't right unless Shane, Tariq, and Raouf Nayim is involved
I did ery'thang from robberies to dope
And why'all just lie about it, like it's a big-ass joke
Playin like kids, I think you want me to spank you
Ninety-nine on the charts with a ship anchor on your ankle
And if you niggaz don't like what I say
I'm in Newark on Market and Hasley e'ry fuckin day

Ok, Black on black Crime, Black on black violence
We don't talk to police
That's black on black silence
Living in Hell here we are just living on welfare
When everybody is broke, you feel for your welfare
Ah! Look at them thugs, how dangerous they are with gun in hand
Look at them ghetto girls twerking on that instagram
Don't bring them to our church cause we don't want that Riff Raff
What do you expect when most of us grew up wishing for dads
Go tossing on Community, people losing hope
Why you think he on that corner selling dope?
And now accord its a plan, We were chained on that boat
See America left our right we still hanging from the rope
And I promise
Wanna leave it in the past, but it's hard
Cause I just seen an unarmed teen shot down like a dog
I just pray you hear my heart
Cause it's heavy and unrifing
See the reason for this song, is that i'm aching

Why don't you walk in my shoes for a minute
Come, Ride with me, Ride on with me down this lake [x2]

Oh I'm hurting, I'm ashamed
And I'm wondering, Do you know my Pain
Oh I'm hurting, I'm ashamed
And I'm wondering, Do you ever know my Pain

And I'm convinced that we should love one another
Regardless of our opinion, we all bleed the same color
We're made in the image of God and no other
It's clear the world is hurt but I could tell you Daddy love us (love us)
So even if you hate me, Imma Love you
Imma heal your heart and tell the Lord take this pain from you
Imma Pray for you, Imma feel your struggle
You gonna feel mine
Imma Walk with You, I walk with you

Herc' was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro
Herc' could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking SRO
He was a no one
A zero, zero
Now he's a honcho
He's a hero
He was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero just like that

The girls went wild with
Ooh's and ah's
And they slapped his face
On every vase
(On every ""vahse"")

From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you
What's a Grecian urn?

Say amen
There he goes again
Sweet and undefeated
And an awesome ten for ten
Folks lined up
Just to watch him flex
And this perfect package
Packed a pair of pretty pecs

Hercie, he comes
He sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were
Going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains, and spunk
From zero to hero a major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk

Who put the glad in gladiator?

Roz Ryan,"Bless my soul Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking SRO
He was a no one
A zero, zero
Now he's a honcho
He's a hero
Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero just like that 

When he smiled the girls went wild with oohs and aahs
And they slapped his face on every vase (on every vahse)

From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you what's a Grecian earn

Say amen there he goes again
Sweet and undefeated and an awesome ten for ten
Folks lined up just to watch him flex
And this perfect package packed a pair of pretty pecs

Hercie, he comes, He sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains, and spunk
From zero to hero a major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk

Who put the glad in gladiator? (Hercules)
Whose daring deeds are great theater? (Hercules)

Rozalén,"Te duelen los ojos, sienten como se hinchan, toca remar
Me balanceo en hilos de cocer, estoy a punto de caer
Apuras el café, apartas el diario y te vas

Agarras calendarios y te mientes
Y al romperlo pretendes al tiempo engañar
Y te levantas, enciendes la luz y te parece que hiere
Y te bañas y al caer el agua te parece que empapa de más
No estoy hecha para mi

En cambio cuando te miro todo cobra sentido
Y si vale la pena es por ti

Me oprimen el pecho, se entrecorta la respiración
Lamo mi sudor, el mismo que recuerda que sigue latiendo el corazón
El día es hielo y sin embrago yo logro arder
Temo al alma, por su dictadura y cobardía que rompe al caer
Y me consumo al pensar en cómo y dónde estarás
Y me asfixio cuando pienso en lo que pudo ser y nunca será

Rozalén,"Fueron cuatro los segundos que pasaron
Hasta que pude encontrarte entre los rostros congelados
Y pasó una eternidad al mirarte y contemplar
En tus ojos reflejada mi mirada
Y hoy bendigo las razones casuales por las que
Decidiste elegir mi banco para esperar, para encontrar
Fue tu rose, fue tu aroma, despertando mis hormonas,
Lo que me obligó a cerrar la mente y respirar,
Y controlar la activación

Y mi razón se convirtió
En buscarte entre las calles, en los parques, tiendas, bares
En sonrisas y destellos de cristal
Quien siguió la consiguió
Y esta historia comenzó a brillar
Y un buen día te atreviste a confesarme que tenías
Tanto miedo a que yo supiera de tu realidad, y no comprendes

Que no es tu signo positivo
En que invierte en conflictivo, las cosas del querer
Que eres tu quien me revuelve, que eres tu quien me enamora
Tu quien me convierte en la mejor persona
Y si tengo que gritarte lo que siento
Te digo que te quiero con tu suerte, con tu mierda,
Con pasado, con presente, con o sin enfermedad
Y tú no vez que quiero seguir comiéndote a besos
Y tú no vez que quiero seguir comiéndote a besos

Y es que el miedo que yo tengo es simplemente
No poder saborearte lo suficiente
Es dejarte escapar, es vivir sin apostar
Por quien juega con la mano más potente
Son tus ojos, no tu sangre, los que arrastré a mi cama,
Cada noche y cada día al despertar

Y es tu sexo, no tu sangre, el que se adentra protegido
Entre los huecos más oscuros de mi intimidad, y no comprendes
Que es tu risa, no tu sangre, quien contagia de alegría,
Las esquinas, los rincones de mi vida
Que eres tú, que no es tu sangre, quien invade de felicidad mis días

Que no es tu signo positivo
En que invierte en conflictivo, las cosas del querer
Que eres tu quien me revuelve, que eres tu quien me enamora
Tu quien me convierte en la mejor persona
Y si tengo que gritarte lo que siento
Te digo que te quiero con tu suerte, con tu mierda,
Con pasado, con presente, con o sin enfermedad

Rozalén,"Porque las hadas existen
Aunque muchos no sepan verlas
De hecho, pueden pasar por tu lado, y que no te des ni cuenta

Y si así te fijaras, en todas las miradas
De quienes se cruzan por tu vida, las descubrirías

Y aunque recién levantadas tengan los ojos algo hinchados
Y el cabello despeinado
Ellas son muy bellas enfocadas de ambos lados
A veces hasta maquillan pero de manera suave 
Pues deben disimular sus rostros angelicales

Lapiceros negros y carmín de labios para parecer una mas
Cuando las hadas se hacen presentes llevan una vida aparentemente normal
Y las puedes encontrar yendo a la universidad
Comprando en supermercados, tomando café en un bar
Sentaditas en los trenes difi coches o autobús
Tienen magia en sus encantos los que las digiere de toda la multitud

Y así la magia no acaba nunca
Porque las hadas nunca morirán
Y es que la magia habita en las alas
Y en las mujeres se reencarnaran

Deberás tener cuidado con las hadas
Y es que el brillo de sus ojos
Tienen el poder de excitarte y hipnotizan con sus rostro
Tan dispuestas a invadirte con alegrías
Que tus labios quedan sin remedios y sueltan sonrisas

Y ademas son divertidas tienen la empatia de saber que decir
O que hacer en cada instante para que te puedas evadir
Y olvidar todos tus males
Viajar a otros mundos descubrir nuevas estrellas 
Recordar otros sonidos rozar el cielo con ellas

Tienen el don de enamorar es mas que ponerles sus 
Caritas serán para que soñara un sueño soñaran 
Con voz de el los por siempre al despertar

Y así la magia no acaba nunca
Porque las hadas nunca morirán
Y es que la magia habita en las alas
Y en las mujeres se reencarnaran

Y aunque sorprenda también se equivocan debes en cuando 
Las veas llorar no han encontrado el consuelo 
A una misma pues los poderes son pa' los demás
Las hadas buscan sueñan y nunca desisten
Las hadas luchan por hacer su meta realidad

Pa' que te adentres dentro tan dentro de mis adentros, que

Sus rizos ahuecados
Ojos azules, yo por el contrario

No suelo peinarlo y no tengo muy claro de qué color es

Pero en él tú puedes, esconderte en la noche
Y que nadie te encuentre y esfumarte en el túnel
Camino a mis ojos de negros desfiles
De luces que brillan pintando mensajes que te idealicen

Y por mencionar su pecho, pequeño y bien firme
Soportes de aguja, delgado vientre
No tengo otra opción, pues con la gravedad
Y el peso del mío tenderá a bajar

Almohada en la noche, primer alimento
De quien te hará inmortal y quien querrá brotar
Detrás del ombligo que tanto te gusta tocar

Si decides marchar, te espero tranquila que ya volverás
Si te pretendes quedar, asumo el riesgo de oír todo lo que perdí
Si me dan a elegir, te ofrezco lo más exacto de mi

De ser perfecta para mi, para los dos

Pero de mis extremidades no te puedes quejar
Largas y delgadas, brazos firmes a explorar
En cambio mis pies, feos, largos y llanos
Y sé lo que odias las uñas de mis manos

Tuyos mis soportes, tuyos son mis dedos
Pa contar los lunares que decoran mi cuerpo
Tuyos son los hoyuelos que acaban en mi espalda
Y tuyas las caricias que deshacen mi cama

Ni chata mi nariz, ni de carnosos labios
Ni orejas pegaditas ni mentón delicado
Con facciones duras, mejillas en alto
Pero rostro risueño con sabor a miel

Oleré deseos, morderé tus miedos
Escuchando tus ruegos, besaré tus éxitos
Me inventaré mil cuentos, te cantaré mil nanas
Porque nos merecemos me entrego a ti

Si decides marchar, te espero tranquila que ya volverás

Lo confieso, no puedo disimular
Cuando parpadea el brillo en mis ojos

Y si arquea las cejas que empapan con fuerza

El sudor, que recorre sin perder
Ni un segundo, cada esquina de mi piel
Lo confieso, no me aguanto en soledad
Necesito que me rocen los demás

Duele dentro, me perdí y no me encuentro
En esta ciudad que me parece tan inmensa
Y yo me siento tan pequeña
Y me enfado, me enrabieto, me cabreo
Pierdo cierta compostura
Quiero todo siempre aquí y ahora
Y no se ni por donde empezar

Que come por dentro todas las ilusiones que tengo
Que salgan arrugas en las comisuras de tanto reír
Que vuelvan a verme buenas vibraciones
Que repitan que todo ira bien
Que me eches de menos
Que en la vida me quiera bien

Saltan chispas demasiado que observar
Lo confieso, no puedo disimular
Quiero mantener la mirada que cruza
Y pensar que puede haber detrás de los rostros
Que se van sin parar a imaginar
De donde vienen los quejidos del penar
Reconozco que ya ni me conozco
Busco el fondo
Indeciso, oscuro y hondo

Duele dentro, tengo frio
Y no caliento ni los dedos de mis pies
Ni la lengua ni mis labios
Ni las huellas de mis manos
E insisto y resisto no desisto
Quedan toallas prefijadas
Saco pecho y clave los dientes
El sendero ya comenzó

Que se huele el miedo
Que come por dentro todas las ilusiones que tengo
Que salgan arrugas en las comisuras de tanto reír (ja ja)
Que vuelvan a verme buenas vibraciones
Que repitan que todo ira bien
Que me eches de menos
Que en la vida me quiera bien

Pa' que ignore los teclados
Que me acercan a tu voz

Que come por dentro todas las ilusiones que tengo
Que salgan arrugas en las comisuras de tanto reír

La atención cayó sobre otros ojos negros
Todo el tiempo que perdí en la apariencia que fingí
Y después dejé de ser yo
Queda claro me disfrazo en cada circo
Despersonalizo, sales de uno mismo
Luces que nos pegaran
Almas roban y al final
Ver callar y sonreir

Resulta que cambié mil pensamientos
Que no se deja nunca de aprender

Hay poco de pregunta musical
Morboso el país en el que vivo
Tendré que acostumbrarme a callar
Criada y educada por la iglesia católica
Moderna, tolerante, carne de emisora comercial

Sin un adiós

At your side passion go away
Sleeping alone’s not a crime
My bed is not a freeway

We tripped so much it feels good
With time boys become lazy
You are no more in the mood

Rozz Moorehead,"Mister Frankie Diamond was my best friend We were partners in a business down on see & 7th 
Nothin' ever got this good brother down He was a real live wire in an electric town 
Frankie started hangin' with an uptown girl 
A Harlem lady in the social whirl
On Saturday night he'd put on his best clothes 
And go out steppin' with his Black Rose
Now Frankie went upstate for a couple of years
A guest of the nation and he was in tears 
He called me up, he said ""hey friend of mine I got one favor to ask you while I'm doin' my time She's the Queen of New York City 
She bewitch all men soul 
She the blood that flow right through me So don't be messin' with my Black Rose 
Keep your hands off my Black Rose"" My Black Rose, he don't own ya... 
While Frankie was upstate, his Harlem girl 
Continued to spiral in her social whirl 
So I paged her from my gig on East 7th I said, 
""Hey, babe, you doin' anythin' round about 11?""
She said ""Uh-uh"" in her uptown voice 
So we met at Beiruit for cocktails and ice 
When she crossed that room in her tight red dress 
I wasn't thinkin' of Frankie, I have to confess
She said ""hey, best friend, let's go back to my place I need to fix my mascara and remodel my face"" 
But it rained on the way back to her house 
And when she closed the door she took off her blouse 
She's the Queen of New York City
She bewitch all men soul Next thing I know I'm whisperin' sweet nothin's Lyin' in bed with my Black Rose I'm makin' love to my Black.. 
My Black Rose, he don't own ya 
So stay with me tonight...
At nights I'd lie there and listen to her breathe
With the sweat on my brow, how could she sleep

So deep, so sweet as calm as a rock 
While I pushed back the seconds oozing from the clock
Now the letters I wrote Frankie returned unread 
The word leaked out I'd be better off dead 
But in the crimson dawn, Black Rose would unfold 
And drain all the poison from my soul 
Now I'm standin' up here on forty deuce
Another terminal man waitin' for his bus
Here come Frankie with his head all shaved
Is that a piece in his pocket, or is it a blade 
Now I'm lyin' face down in the terminal dirt 
With a hole in my chest, but I don't feel no hurt I don't wanta go to heaven, I been there before 
Just spent two years in paradise with my Black Rose 
She's the Queen of New York City 
She bewitch all men soul
When you go and find her body 
Bury me next to my Black Rose 
Still in love with my Black Rose 
She's up in heaven now, my Black Rose 
You won't be makin' love to my Black...
My Black Rose, he don't own ya... 
So stay with me tonight, for the rest of your life 
Roisin dubh, me no can get over you
A time is in me mind no matter what I do 
Roisin dubh me no can get over you
Now Frankie comin' back and I know that I am through 
Mister Frankie Diamond tell me do the right thing 
Watch his girl while he away at Sing Sing
But me and Rosie, we have a little fling 
Now Frankie comin' home, wicked trouble it will bring 
Wicked trouble it will bring

Very dark placid skies bring an end
No moon shining like an untouched
Ass of the boy next door

Of a strange drug
Set the leathery skin of a female
Straddling a furnace

Illuminates in blue
Hands melt against its surface
Feel no pain
Kiss the burner, lips fall away

Of her thighs
She tightens her grip on one last
Exaggerated movement

Then falls to the ground

Over the mound

The next in line, a young boy
Approaches
He is assaulted by the flames

The four walls drain me dry
Of all imagination
Crying out to be told to stand still
Crying out to be told to stand still
The price of red death
Is the price of true love
The black Queen jumps through my skin
The king of hearts is waiting
Close to home
Someone's shooting outside
Trigger finger itchy
Another moving target
Move blood on your Surplice
More blood for the price of red death
Nailing you to the wall
Nailing you to the Spanish Mystic
Nailing you to the wall
Three shots ring out to scream
Who wants to play Roman Soldier
That lives inside of me

What do you see?
My secret fear of being alone
I sit and hold hands with myself
I sit and make love to myself
I've got blood on my hands
I've got blood on your hands
Blood on your hands

Buried deep 'neath the shroud

The prayer hands lays down
On the edge of my sleep
Sister death in lepers's guise
Through crimson eyes

Rozzi Crane,"[Chorus]
Swing, out of your shoes
And if you should lose this time
Keep on swinging and swinging and soon
When you connect
With all of your strength
Look up and you might see a dent in the moon

Yeah, you see them craters?
That was ‘cause a kid said there’d be none greater
In ten years Hammering Hank was at the plate launching balls into space saying see ya later
Skinny as a toothpick but he got a knack
Watch him swing a broomstick at a bottlecap
Watch him rinse and repeat till he’s on the map
Going from the cheap seats to the autographs
Papa put a bat in my hand and all he said was never ever, ever, ever rock a Dodger hat
And whether you win or you didn’t you gotta be getting dirty
And we better send your jersey to the laundromat
It was in the cards
I knew someday I’d be a big league star
Playing second base for the Giants wearing number 9 rocking knee-high socks
If I just worked hard

[Chorus]

We had our 6th grade baseball tryouts on the basketball courts
So a fastball—had hops
We didn’t have a grass field and so coach hit us grounders
Off the asphalt—I dropped
A lot and so he hit ‘em faster and I took ‘em off my ankles
Yelling that’s all you got?
And when I saw my name on the roster I went insane
Like I was sniffing bath salts, I’m not—here to play soft
I’ll go beastmode on a piñata and bite its motherfucking face off
Until it rains candy out of its neck-hole
I don’t go flexing my pecs, or get swole
I wasn’t the fastest
And when I moved it kinda looked like I was running through molasses—true
It’s silly to give a shit about a game but earth
Is a little ball that’s spinning on its axis—too

[Chorus]

I wasn’t cut out for the bigs, guess I been a fool
And middle school was just a bit of cruel ridicule
But when you step into the ranks of the man
It’s like they push you from the high dive to the kiddie pool (thanks)
It’s time to ballroom waltz that plank
We’re little minnows in a small shark tank
You try to swim without getting blood in the water
But you’re all heart and guts like a ballpark frank
Never an all-star
I had to keep score
If I were perfect I would quit and join the Peace Corp
I’m not a hero, if I didn’t try my doubts eat at me
Like I’m a carcass on the sea floor
So say this shit is too corny
It tastes better to me than, ‘ooh poor me’
I’m just trying to sing a different tune
And then fit into a world that didn’t have room for me

You gotta learn to swim against the tide
You gotta learn to drop your foolish pride
You gotta learn to know these things they're dust
You gotta learn that misdeeds only rust.
You gotta learn the chains can open up (these genes survive)
And environment can fuck you up (the eyes)
You gotta learn that drugs don't really work (more music)
Unless you know the ones that hurt
Oh babe let's do it again (please baby)
I wanna put the record on and live it again (live it again)
I wanna rewind the tape, turn off the clocks
This is life now, undo my locks

Toca o telefone
Chega um telegrama enfim
Ouvimos qualquer coisa de Brasília
Rumores falam em guerrilha

Viola e canto ingênuo do caboclo
Caiu o santo do pau oco
Foge pro riacho
Foge que eu te acho assim
Fulano se atirou da ponte aérea
Não agüentou fila de espera
Apertar os cintos
Preparar para descolar
Nos chegam gritos da ilha do norte
Ensaio pra dança da morte
Tem disco pirata
Tem vídeo cassete até
Agora a China bebe Coca-Cola
Aqui na esquina cheiram cola

Aromatizante tem

RPWL,"I thought you know me standing face to face
I thought I could feel me. But nothing is the same
And when I'm too near. You hide away from me
You can't love what you need. It's so hard to set you free
I don't know what it's like, what it's like.
Have you ever thought. That I can't hear the phone
A misunderstanding. Is there something I should know
But maybe deep inside. You'll find out nothing is the same
Why can't you be here?
Don't understand the games you play",I Don't Know (What It's Like),2002
RPWL,"Two weeks without a single word
Walking through the churchyard
You'll find the way out on your own
We still don't reach each other
And when the leaves start falling down
They cover every trace of you
I never chose to be around
There is no redemption
Damn we never had a chance
Please say goodbye when you leave me
Wreck my life
Don't tell me why?
Should I stay
When I feel the rain is falling down
Why should I stay
When I feel you're not the only one
You set me drifting once again
Must have been a thing you said
I always tried to be the way
You tried to see me
Now that the final tear has been shed
Don't say goodbye and deceive me
Wreck ma life
Don't tell me why?

Bring me back where all began
Sure I wish that I'd been right
To say goodbye to go

Left behind me who will pull me from
The jetstream with its surface sunlight?
Nothing is left that can't be done

Sun- Let's take a trip and try to kiss the sun
Sun- Let's take a trip
On my way to space the blinding beauty's rising
With us longing to make it to the moment

Of your greatest triumph
Think of the time when we were young
And we tried to kiss the sun
Open your mind to motion always on the run

Undone ? Are we caged inside a universe
Of light? Two of us we count as one

And with the call of the nightingale
I make my way
And fly into the dawn

'cause I can't recall our last date
at the picture-show
waiting for a smile
So I hide behind the glare of
an open-minded stare
Gathering the snapshots of my life

And when you turn the page
The pictures of you fade to gray
Waiting for a smile
All the way I tried to be

important for my life

And there was nothing left to
say about us anymore

You shut the door like many times before
Drowning in your past

Words we say
Look at me now
Reaching out to you
Cause all the way your are
All the way you feel
All the way you live
Is how it ought to be
Never let it bring you down
I cannot face the world without you
How I wish you were around
There's still a place for us to fly to
You'll never fit into this life we live
I'd catch you if you fall
You? You should have seen before
Talk to me now
There's no single word I wouldn't try to
Understand
I worship the ground
That you will walk with me
Cause all the way you are
All the way you live

RPWL,"Silent tears are streaming down
Gather to forbidden streams
The shifting clouds flowing entangled
Shadows edge the scenery
Thoughts collide with chained emotions
Seems like they were born again
The last glow of my dying senses
Erupted from the end of all our dreams
The gentle art of swimming
Swimming through our live

Through worlds of every colors
Screaming their delight
Passing through a sudden silence
Single echoes died away
Seas of light in three dimensions
Climbing through the atmosphere
Followed by my cosmic ego
Childhood pictures blurred by time
Every point of my emotion
Resolves itself again in all my dreams",Gentle Art of Swimming,2003
