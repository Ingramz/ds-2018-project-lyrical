Symphony X,"Lurking out of sight
Night shall fall and feed my frenzy
Beneath an eerie moon a change comes over me

Eyes glow by candlelight
A face divided in the mirror
My psyche ripped by daggers of my alchemy

Side by side with myself again
As midnight's curse descends on trembling hands

Oh, save my soul
Losing control when the bells toll

Savage on the prowl
In the lamplight's glow, nocturnal
My breath hangs like ghosts in the evening air

This ill effect, a vile creation
Of my design, abomination
The madness rages on and on

Side by side with myself again
As midnight's curse descends on trembling hands

Oh, save my soul
Losing control when the bells toll
Oh, feed my soul
I'm in control, when the bells toll",The Turning,2002
Symphony X,"Alone I traveled through the mountains
Led by a star fading west
When I came upon an ancient ruin of a church
And it was there I stopped to rest

Then the black and gloomy night that chased my footsteps
Crashed down on me like a wave
Whispering through the trees and eerie breeze
Carried a voice beckoning me to be her slave

In a whisper she said

[Chorus]
Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Embrace the night

From the black and twisting shadows rose a woman
Beauty alluring to the eye
Oh her devilish grin, her moonlit skin
And long dark hair flowing down around her thighs

As she approached I felt the evil growing stronger
I waltz with the wicked within
Frozen in my place, she kissed my face
And in a storm of passion bathed me in sin

In the madness, she said,

[Chorus]

Then she weaved a mist, and cast me into the shadows

""Come with me, love eternally, forever mine""
""Set me free, in death we'll dance eternally forever and ever""

As so the light, cast down from the heavens,
Washed over me like wave
I awoke, it seems, from some crazy dream
Only to find I was standing at her grave

In my nightmare, she said

[Chorus]

Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Don't ever leave me, never leave me

[Chorus]",Wicked,2002
Symphony X,"Against the wall, they see you
No where to run, nowhere to hide
Hero in mask, the cracks are showing
A faceless god to shade to perfect light

Wounds of hate that pierce so deep
They never die
Oh, my revenge is bitter sweet

Lost in the night
Wandering alone
Try as I might to escape the fight
It never lets me go
Oh no, oh no, I've got to find a way
A way, a way, a way to rise above it all

Fades into the cruel shade night

Yeah!

That is when we'll meet again
Oh, when the shadows keep
In the twilight I'll descend

Wretched promenade, watch the freak parade
Celebrate the suffering and affliction

Laugh at tragedy, worship sin with me

Spitting on the shrine, drink the poison wine
Leave a life in ruins, tattered and torn

Completely interfaced to a God without a Face

Striking with spears of hate,

Come watch the war god bleed.

Syn,"Now if you got yo hat tilted to tha side
And you always down to jack a bitch for her ride
Or the colors that you rep make others upset
Then you might be gang related! (ain't nothin' wrong)

Never once been seen alone
Ever since you can remember you was fully grown
Slangin' rocks on tha block with a knot in ya sock
Then you might be
Gang related! murder rap
Notches all in your belt
Robbery and sellin'
Trees the only jobs that you held
Been to more damn funerals than the reverend himself
Then you might be
Gang related! in and out tha penitentiary
With no thought of graduation or a fuckin' degree
Still clockin' ""g""s from what you learned on tha streets
Then you might be
Gang related! (ain't nothin' wrong)

[Chorus x2]
You might be (what!? what!?)
You might be gang related!

Do you wear a hatchetman?
You in a gang and yo ass better be ready to do that thang
You rep tha jrb and you will never switch
(jrb?) juggalo rydas bitch!
Did you beat your girlfriends who dissed your boys
Did your crew's name originate in Illinois?
Do you cross your enemies out with a ""k""
Then you gang related to muthafucka like Violent J

I'm always asked if I'm gang related
By police and the public and I'm startin' to hate it
If I wasn't already that would sure make me think
About the problems that I have and what I'd do to be free
Besides gang related's such a harsh word
For them to call a bunch of homies takin' over tha world
Willin' to die for everything that we built
The battleground we call turf where haters come to be killed

[Chorus x4]

Do you participate in gang related activities?
03's, 211's, 187's?
If you do that's okay, fuck we all do
I'm only tryin' to say you gang related too bitch!
Take anybody killa
I know him but I wouldn't trust him as far as I can throw him
He's fuckin' crazy as hell
You wouldn't know
Right now he's chewin' holes in the floor here at the studio
I don't even want to do this
But he asked me to and I'm scared of his pistol-whips
We're all sick in the hatchet's hatchery
But I just happen to be the master bitch-slappery
The bottom line, I won't say it again until you play it again
If you're gang related hope you're my friend
'cause if I see you wearin' some shit I don't like
I'm shuttin' your cranium down with a lead pipe

[Chorus x4]

Ah ha
Ha ha
Ha ha ha! you know what man? you just might be!
In spite of your own knowledge of 'em
A gangsta, gangobodacious, smacksimus
Maximum boogie woogie ryda aka gang related
You dilapidated muthafucko!

Welcome to the great incredible paper chase
Keep your boots laced if you want to keep pace

Oh no, niggas ain't scared to hustle
It's been seven days, the same clothes
Ask them originals 'cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg and Pharaoh
Step away from the mic, they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

Say my name, say my name
Observe how I stake my claim, I independently lay it down
And played my game, my own two raise my flame
'Cause dick ridin' ain't my thang

I earned what they said I wouldn't
I got it the way they said I couldn't
But now I'm gettin' it and they whole grill is crooked
Mad 'cause I'm gettin' caked out from my bookings

When y'all was askin' permission, I just stepped up and took it
What? The kid's better buy my rookie card now
'Cause after this year, the price ain't comin' down
And if you got a joint bubblin' then get money now

'Cause in a minute, there's gonna be some real trouble comin' out
Just a warnin', as usual some cats won't heed it
The hard headed always gotta feel it to believe it
It's a shame that jealous gaze is too short to see it

But when they face hit the cement, they nod in agreement
We could play nice and decent or dirty like the 7-1 Precinct
Call it a day or make it a long evenin'
You keep on schemin', man, give me some more reason
To have the women in your mama's church screamin', ""Lord Jesus""

Harder than y'all 'cause, I'm smarter than y'all
I know that deep down, it's got to be bothering y'all
Pay attention, watch fly gon' get larger than y'all
Put your pride on the rocks, make you swallow it all

The mathematic problem for y'all, it just get harder to solve
Every day that the saga evolve
The do or die, stay rumblin' and bumblin' hard
And when we move, we ain't got no discussion at all

East coast on your neck and you ain't shruggin' it off
Try to bullyfoot and end up stumblin' off

Gettin' spanked when there's too much trouble to talk
Respect mine

Oh no, look at who they let in the back door
From Long Beach to Brooklyn they know
We rock from the East to West coast
Queens salute to Pharaoh
(You know)
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

Very contagious, raps should be trapped in cages
Through stages of wackness, Pharaoh's raps are blazin'
And it amazes me how you claim thug
But go two-ways without Sky Tel pagers

I'm intellectual, pass more essays
Than motorcade police parades through East LA
More beef then deli's, thus, what I vent is just
What you lust to vent is irrele'

Huh, Hallelujah, Pharaoh Monch'll do ya
Maintain the same frame of mind, screw ya
Get the picture, sit ya, seat ya, preacher with scriptures
I'm equipped to rip ya, reach ya

Pharoahe and Mos is verbal osmosis
Coast to coast, we boast to be the most explosive here
Ferocious, the lyrical prognosis
The dosage is leavin' you mentally unfocused here

MC's, just come on 'round
You're the next contestants on 'Catch-A-Beat-Down'
Don't be hesitant, sound cracks the sediment
It's evident we medicine for your whole town

Sky's the limit, game's infinite when I'm in it
All windows is tinted, how you seein' me when I'm in it?
Rap, we got it on lock, man, stop that
Put that mic back down, boy, drop that

Catch side of the morning that passes by through my window

Spin slow, drawn into strong voice of reason
Standing there in soul thinking of summer ?
Just longin' for another season
For no particular Reason hear I stand-
Just rocked another show, just can't remember where I am
And my families far from here, but the stars are bright this evening
On this morning on this afternoon, just got here now I'm leaving
And I shall remember the marble just as clear as I do yesterday
Never dance with the Devil, 'cause I can't afford the hell to pay

When I fish the phonograph so we could set the record straight

Just let me show this world a better way
How you helped through to your heart and all the times you fade away
I get to, say these words and speak my piece to Catholic Crowds

Workin' it out (out), placin' my feet to concrete
Hittin' the street with vengeance, steangence, so sweet
What bitter we consider every circle we pass
Probl'why the reason that I reason with class, so step fast
We pushed and finally pushed that was burnin' staying determined
And yearnin' 'cause the lessons we learnin' were life long (life long)
Its my song, I place to erase
And transpose all these average Joes
With weak flows-
Who knows not, -
The true livin' roles who ascended, blended
With the beat, compete, and apprehended
Today's feelin' all right, color all right
 Being blocked by the shotgun and pray every day and night
Now I've gone a full day without some wackness heard
The One's speakin' absurd-
Are finally heeding my word.   (ya right)
And now I'm left with nothing else to say
That be the Night that I Called it A Day (Called it a Day)

I'm gonna throw thoughts to a page
Let 'em fall where they please
Let 'em rise to the sky, rain down, on four seas
An ocean of possibilities that dwellin'
Yellin' at the top of my lungs convicted by stone tablets as a felon
A nocturnal being of love since the grown of time
Watch the sunrise with both my daughter's eyes
Permanent Shine, refine my reflection inside
Livin' to die, dyin' to live, and all glory given back to God

It was the Night that 24 turned into 12
Had to adjust my spiral off, from the top of the shelf
On the blank page, using the utensil of potential
I'm diggin' in my Brain so I could Rip the Instrumental
With 20 bars left, and I'm consistent from the intro
Lighting candle sticks, as the rain hits my window
Need to focus in, take the topic and let it flow
Got 8 down for the count and 16 to go
The Writer's blocks are stepping stones
Towards the metronome
I'm racing dead last
I'm head last
Placed on my prose
Nocturnal with my journal, a wordplay professor
The aggressor, resembling soda cans under pressure
I'm shakin' but not stirred, deterrent from my train of think
Now I'm aligned, readjusted to infuse the ink
I want to handcuff the hands of time
No great spirit here allotted for here's the sunshine...

[Chorus]

Bet I'm casting nets and dreads
The deep blue ways are wet?????
God's Silhouette, I want to palettes painted pink by suns and sets
BURNT from a long days work, but feelin' fine
Tip his cap and path the moon on his back, his day declines
Candlelight Switch as you slip into the evening
A courtesy to the sun, as it dips below the ceiling
Feeling sort of satellite, like the wind beneath my wings
Or the tightrope, or gravity keeps lunar kites on orbit strings
Man on the moonlight, dream before my time
Like the moon reflects the sun, I make the black begin to shine
Like the moon rewinds the waters, makes the ocean recline
I collapse your mind; I'm Syntax, but melancholy kind
Redefine the best, framed fresh in terms of holiness
Bless the mike, device, 'cause I get nice to keep the conscious
And I split tense mint's spit words like sentence fragments
Moon dust the must 'cause I ain't' in it for the cabbage
The incandescent presence spins, as I'm your present flame
But my name would flicker out my name syntax the wax and wane
For the name above names, I'm so glad that Christ came
The black bird bright the night, we called it a Day...

Shadows step on the one, on, under every tongue, run
Spoken sentence frags., spoken on shattered breaks
It's a black hole soul with my faith as I take

Break Minutes back with father time to coordinate seconds
I surround the 11th hour with sound as my weapon

Villain threatened to sweat the syndrome of the wicked
Heading for your Auditory where the Listener would stick it

Fiction, we're steel, when it breaks from the construction
Crushing your framework and far surpassing your presumption

Sunrays, like a score with notes my surfacing
Great mad at meteors or record the all heed

And when the, Sun Sets
Some one lets the mike down
We pipe down, unplug it and leave it hide down
But not before we retire the pen
'cause yo tomorrow we'll be back just to do it again

Uh, shackled and scarred
I still maintain my praise of dark days
A sullen world covered in pain
So from Dusk 'till Dawn, I represent his word

I've done a lot of things wrong but I swear I'm a believer

Baptized in the river
I'm delivered, I'm delivered

You're from a small town
You're gonna grow up fast underneath these lights
Down in Hollywood on the boulevard
The dead come back to life

To the praying Mother and the worried Father
Let your children go
If they come back they'll come home stronger
And if they don't you'll know

They say evil that comes disguised
Like the city of angels
I'm walking towards the light

I've done a lot of things wrong but I swear I'm a believer

Synyster Gates,"From the bottom of the ash I rose, yeah
To the top I go Where I’m from its cold
But I don’t need this coat, keep my sleeves rolled
Got my city’s area code on my shoulder, 216 forever in my soul
Swear to God every single night its gets colder
No heat so we all around that stove like

“Fuck this broke shit”, petty ass hustlin
Couldn’t even sell one zone
Slim still workin at the store and the only time
We ever get to eat is when he brings something home
Everydays dark here, prayin for a rainbow
To lead us to that pot of gold
And exchange those nights on a concrete floor
For a bottle of Rose to pop that bitch off like we suppose to

Never gave a fuck if we went gold
I just wanna be able to say that I made it
Cause’ real EST mufuckas don’t fold
Real EST mufuckas dont break up
Real family grows old, Real EST mufuckas representing
For the city where they came even when they gone

And Fuck this throne, ain't no kings
No pretty princess, ain't no queen
No fairy tale endings on the Eastside
Just these broken bomes and those screams
Broken bones underneath these jeans
Broken bricks cover up my streets
Fiends outside trying to get their fix
While my first born in here trying to get sleep

Muthafuck this rap shit
Try burying your boy 6 feet let me show u bout real
Try telling me that u can’t make it up
Out the city 26 dollars to multi-mill’s
Face inside of the XXL
Then try coming back to the Eastside still
Well bitch I did, and its still the kid
Labelled a Bad Boy before this deal

What up Slim, Dub, Xplo, Dre, Swirv, Ash, my boy BK
And everybody from the beginning that
Bled with me knowin I would be here one day
So as I roll through all the hoods that raised me
Looking at the house of pain
I’ma runaway from the ones that pay me hopin
I’ll stay the same

Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me all alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through all these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
Although you're gone
I keep holding on
To those happy times
Oh, girl when you were mine

As I peer through the windows
Of lost time
Keeping looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt baby
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects a hurt I can't control

In you I put
All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes
My whole world has turned to dust

Reflections of
The love you took from
Reflections of
The way life used to be

In you I put
All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes
My whole world has turned to dust

Now baby, why did you do it?

Hope is growing dimmer by the hour

Carefully take aim and then attack-tack-tack

Bonnie breathes her last breath in despair

Syria,"Oggi la mia confusione e tornata leggera
Solo se accolgo le mani di chi io non so
Cado latente nel buio che prima non c'era
Sento il suo volto che ride, io non tornero
 
Non dimentico piu, Non dimentico piu
Non dimentico piu, Non dimentico più, ok
 
Lieve e solenne mi avvolge un anima in pena
Sembra che mi dia dolore che ancora non ho
Parla di vendere il cuore che prima stringeva
Apro le mani e si accorge che mi seguira
 
Un altra me che se ne va
Non spegne piu cio che brucera
Un altra me che giudica
Che cosa io mai saro per te",Non Dimentico Più,2008
Syria,"Le quattro del mattino le foto scorrono 
E le tue pose allegre false si ripetono 
Io ti ingradisco gli occhi 
Vorrei capire 
Se tu abbia smesso mai un secondo di mentire
Cerco in ogni sfumatura del tuo sguardo 
Per salvare anche soltanto il tuo ricordo 
E non mi resta altro 

Che odiare 
Per riuscire a sopportare 
Le vampate di dolore 
Nel vederti allontanare 
E odiare fino a farmi massacrare 
Ed ammettere l'errore 
Di aver speso troppo amore 
Che non potrà più tornare 

Il tuo mondo si nasconde 
Dentro ad un telefono 
Insieme alle tue insicurezze che distruggono 
Ogni tua relazione 
Ogni tua storia 
Come ha distrutto me mi fa saltare in aria 
Ogni volta che tu esci dalla stanza 
E mi lasci questo senso di impotenza 
E non mi resta altro 

Che odiare 
Per riuscire a sopportare

Nel vederti allontanare 
E odiare per non farmi massacrare

Syria,"Come la prima bugia 
Che sta sotto un letto 
Che poi è come uno scrigno 
E nulla è mai protetto 

Come in un gioco d’azzardo 
In cui neghi tutto o niente 
E non ci sono sentimenti 

In un mattino senza sole, senza sosta 
Tutte le cose buone non le ricordi e basta 
Una mattina dentro un bar, nell’ultimo tavolo 
Un caffè, un silenzio, quanto ti costa 

Come non detto, ci pensano i tuoi occhi 
Come non detto, non serve che mi tocchi 
Come non aver detto niente, tanto la verità 
Ha il profumo del tuo cuore 

Come non detto, ci pensano i tuoi occhi 
Come non detto, non serve che mi tocchi 
Come non aver detto niente, tanto la verità 
Ha il profumo del tuo cuore

Come non detto 
Tutte le svolte, le strade, per stare assieme e poi riperdersi 
Come non detto 
Non conta l’arrivo, conta il cammino, l’hai capito tardi 
Come non detto 
Ma la vita è dal vivo, finisce il sogno e ci si sveglia grandi 

La seconda bugia che ti porti ancora addosso 
Non ti serve uno scrigno per coprirti adesso 
Quelle sere in cui ti ho visto 
Sempre dietro ad un filo 
con quel ghigno fuori posto e quel passo furtivo 

Come un piccolo falsario, infondo a un vicolo 
e nessuno cascherà in un crimine così ridicolo 

Come non detto, ci pensano i tuoi occhi 
Come non detto, non serve che mi tocchi 
Come non aver detto niente, tanto la verità 
Ha il profumo del tuo cuore 

Vedi che è sempre tutto un progetto aperto 
Non siamo nè la figlia modello nè il figlio perfetto 
Le scelte di cuore le prendo di petto, le pezze a colori 
La perfezione è solamente un concetto 

L’amore che lega o l’amore che ti nega 
Come una pietra al collo e il peso che ci annega 
Una pagina di vita che prende la sua piega 
Mentre provi a parole ma l’amore non si spiega 

Come non detto, ci pensano i tuoi occhi 
Come non detto, non serve che mi tocchi 
Come non aver detto niente, tanto la verità 
Ha il profumo del tuo cuore

And my heart is lying there

They can't catch me they're never gonna find me
('Cause I'm a High Plains Drifter, drifter)
They're never gonna know that I'm the High Plains Drifter
Pulled over to the river to take a rest
Pulled out a pair of pliers, pulled the bullet out of my chest
Fear and loathing across the country listening to my 8 track
I reached behind the seat and snatched a Kool from the pack
A long distance from my girl, and I'm talking on the cellular
She said that she was sorry and I said yeah, the hell you were
Check my rear view mirror, check the gold tooth display
Check out the odometer and I was on my way
'Cause I'm the High Plains Drifter, the best that you can get
A strapped shoplifter, a pirate on cassette

Bust a Travis Bickle when I feel that I'm getting pushed
Don't step to me or you're gonna get mushed
('Cause I'm a High Plains Drifter, drifter)
I'm doing one hundred twenty plowing over mail boxes
Radar detector to tell me where the cops is
Spend another night at the Motel six
It's five dollars extra get the porno flicks
And then I concoct a Black and Tan in my brandy snifter
I'm a kleptomaniac, K-Mart shoplifter
Cash flow getting low so I had to pull a job
I found a nice place to visit but a better place to rob
I left my car outside, and the engine still revvin'
Taking care of business at seven-eleven
And then I went inside to make my withdrawal
I saw what he had had, but I had to take it all
Knucklehead deli tried to gyp me on the price
So I clocked him off the turban with a bag of ice
'Cause I'm mell-el-o like jell-el-o, cool like lemonade
I made my getaway and then I thought that I had it made
I feel like Steve McQueen, a former movie star
Look in my rearview mirror seen a police car
Ballantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap
I couldn't help to notice I was caught in a speed trap
Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, on the run from Dirty Harry
Stash the cash in the dash, but my gun I did carry
I'm seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night
I got my alibi straight and I pulled over to the right
The cop knocked on my window, said boy, where's the fire?
You've got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire
Outta the car longhair, your goose is cooked
Read me my rights, fingerprinted, and booked
Makin' like a D.T. driving a Gran Fury
Wherever I hang my hat's my home and my past is kind of blurry

Every dog will have its day, mine will be in front of a jury
I'm the High Plains Drifter you know that I'm never in a hurry
('Cause I'm a High Plains Drifter, drifter)
Read me my rights, as if I didn't know this
Threw me in the tank with a drunk called Otis
With his five o' clock shadow, he smelled of three day old beer
My man turned to me and said why are you here
I said I'm charming, I'm dashing, I'm rental car bashing
I'm phony paper passing at Nix Check Cashing
I went before the judge he sent me to the Brooklyn House of D
He said you behave son or we'll throw away the key
Houdini'd out the cuffs, I kicked the screw in the knee
I took the bailiff's wallet and went straight to OTB
I had a good feeling, easy come, easy go
I bet on one horse to win and another to show
And sure enough that nag came in
Brought my ticket to the window and collected my win
And then I broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger

I guess everybody needs somebody to love you can't
Leave love lonely cause being naive to it you can just
Lose it like that See kisses for bruises don't make it
Heal back it be's the sex appeal that's from the next
And not necessarily the sex and one might appeal to
The intellect having a greater affect on how they feelin'
Stimulation breaking down their shields for the real and
As it stands mysteriously curiosity it kills the cat and
Offsets them mentally so they're trapped in behind
These fantasies with no action searching for a remedy
Now she loves her man but there is just a different type
Of chemistry that flairs when her desires on fire quick
Is the fuse another loves for hire

And she said,
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish

Decided to take a ride to see what's really goin' down up on
The northside of town Of course I bought a quarter pound
Of bomb hemp feelin' a-ight like Johnny Kemp on a Friday
Night Lookin' right cause my shit is tight blazin' blunts to city
Lights on Sunset and Crescent Heights Bounce to the House
Of Blues then I slid in free wit tennis shoes, sweatshirt, jeans
And no ID. Soon as I step inside the plizace I recognize the
Fizace of an epp wit an izass more amazin' than grace So
I waste no time to kick my little I say ""How ya doin'"" she say
""I'm doin' fine"" so I commence to macking to baby to see
What's cracking So maybe I get her back at the cabin and
Start attacking Threw back a shot of yack and started jabber
And jibben Fibbing and adibin just to get her to my crib then
We was chilling on the bed bumping some Isley thought I was
About to spread the thighs but she surprised me when she
Said ""oh like that? You know I don't get down"" I know my
Homies gonna clown cause I let her stick around when

But she's been waiting all night so we could be all alone 
This is an everyday thing so we hang out by the phone 
Trying to build something real 
Working tips to the bone 
So much loves gone astray that it won't be coming home 
No time soon 
So I dance with the silhouette beneath the moon 
And she said if satisfactions guaranteed 
Nothing else could come between 
The flight of a new love babe, yeah maybe 
We could be cool instead of sharin' this here ship
With the fools, you know get down to the bone (that) 
Right now, right now, 
Right now, right now, baby,

You're scared to show her make you vulnerable

There's more inside you that you haven't shown

But I'll put you higher than flight pilots

Burn through your clothes like an ion
I am no american idol, no Simon Cowell
Wack n****s throw in the towel
I'm getting money with the rap, pay me by the vowel
I'm hungry like a pack of wolves so I just howl
Holla, Cash rules everything around me
So I'ma get the money, dolla dolla bills in them hundreds

[Chorus]

Ugh, yo, yo yo,

Sometimes I just sit and pray
Said I don't know why do I live my life this way
Why do I live my life this way

Can testify I'm the best of fly
Live your life and I'm gon live mine

Tell me what the fuck an angel does
Were seein kids who ain't aged enough
Getting high off angel dust
From NY to Los Angeles
There ain't no love
In the heart of the city
Looking where they (?)
And they party at
Cardiac arrest can feel risky
Real pissy I chase cheese and real pussy yeah,
Cats used to yawn on his rap now look at em
Shit ain't been the same since them niggas started booking em
Bullet with your pen up, looking sharper than a bulletin
With pin stripes and hollow tip bullets in it
He's something that you'd invest in
Catch him live on late night, but he ain't interestin'
Pop up and poop out something like intestine
No corrections cause the mike been checked in
The only time he be (?) is when he sexin'
My team like teenage mutants and X-men
Fire spark when i step in
He the human torch
Inhaling fumes of all sorts of course
Steez taught me how to store it in my ball shorts
So when we stop by the D we never get caught
I say it again we face cells but never lost
Either be a warlord for 6 fees short.
Each day in this living hell feel remorse
But he had a million dollar smile way before he flossed

Sometimes I just sit and pray
Said I don't know why do I live my life this way
Why do I live my life this way
Yo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes
Can testify I'm the best of fly
Live your life and I'm gon live mine

Yo, I'm trying to Oprah win-win with a ""L"" in my hand
Remotely passed off like the generous man
And they wonder what it cost to put the pen in my hand
But don't understand they the only one who gets the benefit
Sometimes I just sit and pray
They couldn't walk this way in my Js
It wouldn't feel despair, but disarray
Like their souls disappear,
Sing our heart froze, got dropped like
Couldn't close my ghost souls, eyes closed
Covered with Ray Banns, I call it my eyes closed, and I know!
Even through shades of black
I see brighter days looking back in fact
So I relax my mind, see what these tracks can find
The gold mine that will make me rich in both times and mine
Gotta make it all mine if you don't mind
Cause sometimes

Sometimes I just sit and pray
Said I don't know why do I live my life this way
Why do I live my life this way

Can testify I'm the best of fly
Live your life and I'm gon live mine

Right on the block where they sit and play
Lives the vicious ways where they spit and spray
Vicious trey's coming for the ice you kept in yesterday
It's nothing but the history
Protecting ya' from being history
And then the next day your face is just a mystery
For niggas who really ain't feeling me are all my fucking enemies
Even the lightest hours requires heavy artillery
Accelerate without the breaks of a break
And still I'm not eating up to now and there's a lot on my plate
All in a days work of God and his grace
You wanna eat then tell God and say grace
And avoid the heat getting the boil to surface
A soft nigga caught between these rocks and a hard place
Because the Mafia is on the look out for the Scarface
But the ill minded child, is ill minded child

Keeps us apart.
I feel a tearing in half of my heart.
A walk on the water,
Is all that I need.
But miracles are not happening.
You're not even listening to me.
Leaving you ain't easy now,
But loving you's the harder part.
You never want me for myself,
And I've needed you right from the very start.
Oh, won't you stay and try to:
Give a little bit of heart and soul.
Give a little bit of love to grow.
Give a little bit of heart and soul,
And don't you make me beg for love.
Give a sign 'cos' I need to know.
Give a little bit of heart and soul.
Now listen to me.
I wish that I was wrong,
But you don't feel that way.
We drift apart with each passing day.
You never seem to notice any more.
Living in a fantasy,
There's never any room to breath.
Hoping every waking hour,
You'll turn around and say that we can stay.
Won't you even try to:
Give a little bit of heart and soul.
Give a little bit of love to grow.
Give a little bit of heart and soul,
And don't you make me beg for love.
Give a sign 'cos' I need to know.
Give a little bit of heart and soul.
Somehow I lost my way,
Looking to see something in your eyes.
But lover will never compromise.
There is the politics of life.

Hard on the heels of something more

I wasn't in the running, I wasn't in the race

Give a little bit of love to grow
Give a little bit of heart and soul

Give a sign, I need to know
A little bit of heart and soul

That was the heart of the love we shared
Do you keep secret left untold
Can't give love, heart or soul
I used to have a lover with a Midas touch
I turned to gold but he turned to dust
Left me for another, I turned to stone
Now I want your love, heart and soul

Living in a fantasy
There's never any room to breathe
Hoping every waking hour
You gonna turn around and say that we can start

Give a little bit of heart and soul
Give a little bit of love to grow
Give a little bit of heart and soul

Tell me what I should do 
On another day 
We could try again 
I could fly home to you 

Is this some clever game 
We used to be such friends 
Now I am ridiculed by all the secrets that I told 
And so my dream is gone 
Of hope that I depended on 
When will I ever learn 
When will my heart discern 
Just come back and love me and need me

If I say I won't be gone forever 
Would you think it a lie 
I could try to be 
All you want to me 
Would you still say goodbye 
Do I detect in you 
A change of attitude 
I never thought I'd see 
The day you'd turn away from me 
And now I fantasize 
You see the feeling in my eyes 
How will I ever know 
If you should walk and go 
Just come back and love me, need me, see me fly 

See me trying

People tell me you talk behind my back

T'Pau,"Something in the moonlight catches my eye
The shadow of a lover goes dancing by
Looking for a little bit of love to grow, so
Give me love, give me heart and soul
You never let me cross to the other side now
I'm tied to the hope that you will somehow
Hard on the heels of something more
But I lost your love, heart and soul
The tear in my heart as you walk on by

I feel so low and your head is high
Everything you do convinces me more
Please, give me love, give me heart and soul
Looking to the day when I saw your face
I wasn't in the running, I wasn't in the race
You move in a way that I've known before
Now I want your love, heart and soul

Loving you's the harder part
You never want me for myself

That was the heart of the love we shared
Do you keep secret left untold
Can't give love, heart or soul
I used to have a lover with a Midas touch
I turned to gold but he turned to dust
Left me for another, I turned to stone
Now I want your love, heart and soul

Living in a fantasy
There's never any room to breathe
Hoping every waking hour
You gonna turn around and say that we can start

Jackie had a dad who didn't have Jesus
He had no hope, no reason to live
One day she told him of the peace He brings us
The freedom God so freely gives

For fifteen years, eight of those were Jackie's
He wouldn't hear and he wouldn't see
Then before he died he asked Jackie
Who's this man who'll set me free?

ooh little Jackie...ooh little Jackie

He's the man who gave His life for me
Not just a man, in fact a King
The blind see His mercy, the deaf hear His voice

I know Him she said, and He wants to know you

Jackie saw her dad go home to see Jesus
Now she watches a dying world
So much in need of hope and of rest
So much in need of the peace she knows

ooh little Jackie...ooh little Jackie

The world despises, the foolish reign
They mock the Word of God we live
Even though they love to hate Him
He loves them so...that's who Jesus is

T-Bone,"Let's break it out all of this black-on-black, brown-on-brown, in every town,
Because I'm sick of seeing my people's sketches scattered all over the ground.
Since these murders occur every single day, so put the gun away because I want
To live to see another day. A happy day. Where there's peace between

Nations, love within races and no division in the congregations. No more
Pimps and drug dealers on every corner. A homeless people struggling with no
Home freeze and they pump for quarters. I am talkin' about a world of peace,
With no mo' closed caskets if you know rows like most of my homies that have

Been deceased. No more murderers, diseases, or suicides, it's time we all
Wake up and wipe the mucus from my sleepy eyes. And straighten things out
Like a ruler 'cause nowadays, the cart we juggle is full of hate, killas, and
Runaways. I'm sick of it, so I'll be the first brother to shout, let's
Straighten it out 'cause together we can work it out.

[Chorus]
Let's straighten it out, from the west side to the east side.
Let's straighten it out, from the north side to the south side.
Let's straighten it out, from the east side to the west side.
Let's straighten it out, from the south side to the north side.

I wish somebody would tell me why, we can't just straighten out all this mess,
At times I think, my fat should be a bulletproof vest. Got all these homies
Claiming south side, west side, east side, north side, Asian, Black, and Brown
Pride. It seems that there's no mo hope, my own people's send me their guns

And try to push me the dope, I can't cope. But I gotta, why? Because I'm
Sick of all the shots ringing from the sixty-fo and hollas. Remember where we
Was familia, where we could kick it and not worry about your own kind killin'
Ya'. Seems like all we care about is money and fame, drugs in the game, it's

Killin' me softly like Lauren from the Fugees sang. Man, what's it gonna take
For us to grow up, before love is the only ganG sign we throw up? 'Cause all
Our peoples headin' straight for the morgue unless we put down the guns and
Start to trust in the Lord, let's straighten it out!

I wonder what could make a man, hit a woman, wit' a ferious hand. Somebody
Tell me because I just don't seem to understand. And then we wonder why why'all
Kids is bangin' with none at home, it seems the parents is the one givin' they

thick and the thin. How many real soldiers you got on your team playa? Let?s
talk about this thing called friends dog

Friends, All my partners and homeboys
Playas is down to ride and stuck by my side
Friends, Thugs that been down with me
Representin me and my clique, the ORC

Who can express what a playa feel
So much gratitude inside of me for my parters that done kept it real
Loyal through the hard times, when didn't nobody care
Everyone puttin' me down, but you was still there
So many come and go, turn from a friend to foe
But trues is with ya when ya seasoned or broke with no doe
Rolling a bucket, or dippin' in dropped double are's
Poor wit no record deal or signed and a superstar
Who can I call on when my backs up against that wall
That won't judge me, but love me and hug me when I trip and fall
Accept my flaws and mistakes, love me for who I am
Stand wit me waving at fans and when I ain't the man
Picture me crying at the age of 9
So many homeys dying, locked up in pens, living a life of crime
Slugs flying and been a witness to homicide
This life taught me love all you homies while they still alive

Friends, All my partners and homeboys
Playas is down to ride and stuck by my side
Friends, Thugs that been down with me
Representin me and my clique, the ORC


Verse 2

Keep your homies close, 'cause in this business friends turn against you
Especially when you need ?em the most, that's when they'll plot against you
Then commence to rubbing your name in the dirt
Leaving you torn apart with all the pain and the hurt
Jealousy and greed twisted with bitterness and envy
Make your friend be your most hated enemy
Seen it happen so many times before
Make you want to leave the game and not want to rhyme no more
Brotha against brotha and a father hating son
Somebody tell me what have we done
My back got blood stains and scabs from backstabs
Lived life looking for trues that I can call my comrades
Or soldiers, sick of them lying, backstabbing, vultures
In a world that's getting' colder
Need a shoulder that I can cry on, rely on, till the day I'm gone
We share that homey love thug bond, it's a friend, Baby

Friends, All my partners and homeboys
Playas is down to ride and stuck by my side
Friends, Thugs that been down with me
Representin me and my clique, the ORC


Some call 'em dogs, others call 'em rouges and comrades
Partners, hogs and aces, whatever the case is
Ain't no replacing a true to life friend
Soldier who been down through the thick and the thin
From the womb to the tomb, come floods or typhoons
We stuck together, endured the cuts and the wounds
Scabbed and bruised, survived the fights and the feuds
Separated we nuttin', but together we can't lose
Homeboys to the end, from the hood to the pen
My life in exchange for yours and your children
Nuttin' I wouldn't do for a friend like you
When I needed you the most ya came through (that's true)
When you hurt I feel pain, when you sad I cry
Allies and down homies to the day we die
I got ya back like a chiropractor, from day one
Throughout your life until the final chapter, we best friends playa!",Friends,2001

Talkin bout you ain't really bout that ministry
Child please, we's them G's on them knees
Preachin from California to the Florida Keys, we be
Slangin the WORD, while they smokin they're herb
And dippin 64's, hittin switches on the curb
Then swerve back in place, bump that bass
Wit that sanctafied sound produced by that playa Chase
Like Mase, 'I'm fittin, makin ya feel so good'
When I bump this gospel music in your hood, Inglewood
West Covina, Pasadena, then take it to my gente, in Puente
I can't forget about all my patnas in the 415, 510, 916
Make them chips, we stick together like cement and bricks
Now just bounce to this playalisctic Boneybone hit

[Chorus]
Dip bounce, side to side
And come ride wit a play from that killa Cali westside
Pyscho, westcoast, rider, music
For you and all your dawgs to ride to

[T-Bone]
Shh, ain't not talkin, while I'm puttin demons in coffins
Dippin in the Cadillac bumpin Dawkins and Dawkins
Got me wrapped up, tied up
If you love Cali, playa throw the Westside up 
Now watch me ride like them hell's angels
In them Harleys, or them cowboys wit the blue wranglers

Swingin ther lasso, screamin wild wild west
'cause where I'm from, you need a bullet prrof vest
Smoke the what for your stress
Nah dawg, hold up, wait a minute
'cause ain't no high unless the Holy Ghost ain't rolled up in it
I get drunk in the spirit on a day to day basis
And preach the WORD, to my patnas catchin cases
Racist clicks too, piru flamed up in blue
Crips too, God wanna bless you
2, 3, 4 and 5, now close your eyes
And bump this in your ride while you glide and...

[Chorus]

[T-Bone]
I just can't stop, makin suacy gospel hip hop
Fittin do this, til the day that I drop
Like Tupac, 'who do you believe in'
I put my faith in God, blessed to be breathin
Preachin to the heathen, buckin them demons
Oh what a feelin, got the crowd screamin
Dancin on the ceilin
So hate if you wanna man, say what you say
But gospel rap wit Bone is like LA wit out a Dr. Dre
Or Sway without Tech, catchin wreck
Or these Californias streets without a ghetto vet
It ain't happenin, Bibles I'm still packin them
And jackin demons wit them 44 magnums

Yo picture me rollin like Pac in a drop gold double are
Women, champagne, weed, cigars and caviar
Livin tha life of a thug, movin em drugs, duckin em slugs
Dealin wit phones tapped wit bugs, plus
Associated wit some hard hittas, cold killas
Convicts, thugs and drug dealers
Cop killas, and drug lords stackin 8 figures
Quick to pull a trigga and leave a body floatin in the river
We gorillas in this jungle collectin mad skrilla
Bankin on cheddar and cream, from dope fiends
From a land where everybody gotta fend for themselves
Half of the mommies doin 25 to life in a cell
Seems like we dwell in the pits of hell wit no bail
Chained up, captive and tortured by the enemy's spell
Who hears my cries from these lonely jail cell
And what do I profit to lose my soul and gain from drug sales

[Chorus]
Livin the street life
Crystal, drugs and crushed ice
Hangin wit plays who plain hiest and roll dice
In casinos like Bugsy Siegal
We outlaws forever livin illegal
Tha street life

[T-Bone]
A yo, the street life is the only life I know
taught to hustle these streets and grind to make dough
Cope the 4-4, jump in the 6-4
Blast on my adversaries then end up on death row
Yo, this was the life I seen raised as a youth
Where everybody smokin chronic, sippin 98 proof
ain't no happy days and sunshine
In my hood is jus crime, cryin for one time
Slugs flyin, and everybody tryin to come up in this evil drug game
Insane, vision of murder just increase the pain
Cocaine and methamphetamine
I want out, but gave an oath to the death of me
So let it be, Ima ride on my enemy
But when they bury me, I fear where my soul will be
Eternally searchin for light patna, but I'm in the midst of the dark
Its so hard, when you in this ghetto prison lookin for God

[Chorus]

[T-Bone]
Another homie dies, so I wipe the tears from my eyes
And ask God how many lonely painful tears will I cry
Seems like nobody even cares out here in the hood
I tried to get a job, but they swear I'm up to no good
Misunderstood from a young age, on a rampage
From an adolescent carryin hollow points in a smith-n-wesson
For anybody second guessin, if I'm scared to test em
ain't nothin even worth livin for
The richa gettin richa and the ghetto remains poor
Liqour stores and gun shops
And everybody wonder why thugs pack glocks and kill cops
Full of hurt since birth, why was I placed on this earth
Seems like everybody in this ghetto is cursed wit a curse
And what's worse, is that my potnah dyin at a fast rate
Dear God can you help me out, I'm lookin for an escape

I know the world got you down
Bound by the problems and troubles of life
Full of strife pain and misery 
Looking for true peace love and happiness

Sex or Hennessey but come along wit me 
If ya want to hear bout the one that healed the sick 
And made the blind see 
The one that turned water into wine 
And multiplied the loaves and the fishes 
Healed the lady wit the issue of blood and cured leprosy 
Cause even when your friends ain't there 
And you feeling like nobody cares
God's still there ready to cast all your burdens away 
Let Him in your heart this very day and I pray 
That every lyric I spit will penetrate the very depths of your soul 
And I'm gonna let the whole world know 
He can make your sins white as snow 
Now let me bust en espanol, para mexicano, o cubano 
Panameno, colombiano, argentino, chilleno 
Nico, ya puerto ricano, lo que to te enseno 
Es algo que me ensenaron de pequeno
Wit this instrumental I'm gonna make you get sentimental 
Cause I be knowin that your feeling what I'm talkingg bout 
Make ya want to shout shout, let it all out out 
Like tears for fears, I'm tryin to reach my peers 
And the thugs players in the clubs and my patners slanging drugs
Ducking em slugs looking for love 
In a messed up world that's cold like a freezer
That's why until the day I die I'm gonna preach 
The Word of God like the man of God they call Peter 
Mira ahorita you might be going through 
A thing or two but know that Jesus still loves you 
So its all good player wipe your eyes 
Cause Jesus said that everything is gonna be alright 
Now come on down

Problems, troubles trials and storms will come your way 
Jesus offers love and wants to wipe yours tears away
Cause even when it seems like nobody really cares, Jesus is there
And he hears your prayers and he hears your prayers

[Bridge]
Don't cry the Lord replies 
I want to wipe the tears from your lonely eyes 
Its gonna be alright
Tonight you might be going through some things 
But joy comes in the morning time 
And I pray that through this rhyme 
I'm touching your mind 
Body and soul let Him take control 
And I know that if you trust in God, 
Leave your problems in his hands 
Then every things gonna be alright

Your crying in the night cause you're lonely
Praying to the Lord above please hold me
Somebody told me 
That when I'm feeling broken hearted, sad and lost in the valley 
You're the one to console me
Slowly ease the pain that I be feeling deep 
Within free me from the life of sin cause I'm tired of all the banging 
Drug slanging and playing with the girls smoking weed and sipping on the gin 
I need a real friend who won't leave me nor forsake me 
Even if the whole world hates me who makes me 
Feel like I'm somebody special for once in my life 
When all my foes want to lie and player hate me, 
I seen so much drama throughout my life 
So many of my peers died and I wonder why 
I never got to say goodbye look to the sky 
And pray that the Lord hear my cry 
They say that You can set me free take away this pain 
And misery and deliver me from the hands of the enemy 
All because of the blood that You shed at Calvary 
You gave me the gift of eternal life and now I finally see 
That You're the answer to all my needs so I'm down on my knees 
Begging Lord please forgive me 
From this day forward I promise 
To follow where ever you lead 
Wipe my tears Lord

Back on the corner, still livin' in the projects
Still strugglin' down and out with no prophets

Still drivin' through the hood in a bucket

El General de la música con ciencia
T-Bone, aquí con mi amigo Marcos Witt
Para hacerte brincar en la presencia 
De su excelencia, Jesucristo
Todos juntos
Latinoamerica
Vamos a brincar

Hay maneras diferentes de mostrar mi reverencia
De adorarle y acercarme, entregarle mi alabanza
Hay un tiempo para todo
Y este tiempo he apartado para honrarlo
De esa manera haciendo ruido y brincadera

Es tiempo pa' brincar

Ok, manos en el aire
Acaba de entrar el general de este caso
Ven, brinca, empuja y póngase a bailar
Alabanza le canto yo
De las calles, Él me libró
Cuando estaba enfermo, Él me sanó
Y ahora me dedico al micrófono
Para solamente darle la honra y gloria
Soldado de Cristo gritando victoria
Ganando al mundo haciendo su historia notoria
Vaya pues, español, también en inglés
De alabanzas Él digno es
Brinca, baila, muevan los pies
Listo vamos un, dos, tres
No paramos, don't without Christ

And let your love rain down on me

When I was in distress
I needed happiness (Come on)
So I got down on my knees
And asked you to comfort me

So I called your Holy name
And you washed away my sins
Gave me new life again

Wasn't for him, I wouldn't be alive
Chest high for tellin' lies, since then baptized
Look in my eyes can you see the pain
Why does the sun shine when it rains
Hard times got me feelin' daddy never did a thang
But God chose and put me in a Rolls and
Keeps my wrists frozen, never brown nosin'
Like an explosion, I'm causin' commotion
Spit the truth like a prophet, I talk to the ocean
People fear what they can't understand
I thank God that I can, I stay focused keepin' him in my plan
Never losin' my fate, haters gonna try to degrade
Gotta be in my state of mind or relate
Gotta know this is the end and ain't no time to waste
Time to face your fate and I pray you don't end up in a lake
Do whatever it take, so many mistakes we made
But we gon' all get it right once we down by the riverside

Tellin' em reach them partners definitely on them corners flippin' birds

He tried to say he loved her but he could not win
She just fixed her lipstick and kept ignoring him

She was headed for a crash and it even hurt to laugh
'Cause it ended with a bang
When it all came back like a boomerang
When it all came back like a boomerang

She went to a party, where thieves and debutants
All talked in italics with so much nonchalance
He was on the outside, standing in the rain
He saw her through the window, he could not stand the pain

She was headed for a crash and it even hurt to laugh
'Cause it ended with a bang
When it all came back like a boomerang
When it all came back like a boomerang

She went up the staircase with a sleazy Mideast guest

T-Bone Burnett,"He was born in Brooklyn
And grew up in the Church of Rome
There was a girl there who loved him and had faith
He loved her like a madman, he loved her like a fool

He got a lot of big ideas
And fought his way up to mad avenue
He navigated that bizarre world easily
He did good work and he was smart
He knew his superiors, he disdained his inferiors
He was proud and dignified and she waited

The more money made, the more he wanted
The more glory he got, the more he wanted
His appetites were never sated

Everything he knew about himself
He drew from what was around him
You know this suit is you, this car is you
This studio is you

People were no different, people were also his mirrors
Often he was their mirror as well
Life became complicated and overstated
And underrated and she waited

The more power he got, the more he wanted naturally
The more women he had, the more he wanted
His appetites were never sated

Slit up the front and down the back
She wore black high-heeled shoes
With laces that went up her ankles

She wore black velvet gloves
With rhinestone bracelets around them
She had long blond hair, she had long blond hair
(Long blond hair, long blond hair)

And she sat on the jukebox with one leg propped up
And a crowd of boys gathered 'round her
And one tried to kiss her
But she turned her face

And I wish you could have seen her dance
The way she soared across the floor
I wish you could have seen her dance
She did a pirouette and then a Kung Fu step

I wish you could have seen her dance
The way she threw her hair through the air
And I wish you could have seen her dance

I asked her, ""Do you come here often?""
She said, ""I've never been here before""
I asked her, her name and she said
""They call me Kim Boston in England""

""And Kim English in Boston and also in Dallas""

She said, ""It was just like Ireland
Except the wells don't look like wishing wells""

I wish you could have seen her dance
She did the Flavo and the Tango and the Flamenco

I wish you could have seen her dance

And I wish you could have seen her dance

I asked, ""Are you an actress""

I heard you'd been with her for two or three days
I still have her picture taped to my mirror
Did she still look the same after all these years?

I remember her as the most beautiful woman
Was her hair still blond? Were her eyes still blue?
Were they soft and gentle or filled with tears?
Did she still look as hurt after all these years?

I lost track of her way back in the sixties
I even heard that she had tried suicide
There were rumors the government killed her career
Did she still look as scared after all these years?

Will they ever uncover her terrible secret
And untangle the mystery of her life?
Will they ever know why she disappeared?
Was she still as gone after all these years?

Was she still as alluring, still as seductive?
Could she still drive you crazy by the look on her face?
Did she still have a whisper you could hear cross an ocean?
Was she still a scandal still a disgrace?

Was she still as impossible, still as voluptuous?
Still as helpless and full of fears?
Was she still as provocative, still as compelling?
Was she still as late after all these years?",After All These Years,1983
T-Bone Burnett,"She was born in the back of a thirty four Ford
And raised in a foster home
Her guardian made sexual connection with her
Before she was even grown

When she was fifteen she fell in love
With a boy who had a fast car
But she was timid and withdrawn
So she worshiped him from afar

Still he couldn't help but notice her
She was fatally beautiful
Ever since she was a girl
She was fatally beautiful

She ran away to the city the next year
Disowned out of jealousy
She frightened men with her figure
So they treated here like a sleaze

She lived cross the street from a piss factory
As dark as the sun is bright
The kind where you think you just went blind
When you walk in from the daylight

Still they couldn't help but notice her
She was fatally beautiful
Ever since she was a girl
She was fatally beautiful

She was discovered by a man three times her age
Who worked for a studio
And he bought her dresses and perfume
And moved her into his home

He got her a part in a comedy
Where she played a dumb blond whore
And she posed without clothes for a magazine
And the offers came in by the score

In a restaurant in Brussels she pulls back her hair
Picks up a candle and lights a cigarette
And she's recognized by a tourist
Who can't see her face but knows her silhouette

He imagines her robe as it drops to the floor
He imagines her skin soft to touch
He imagines her naked on silk sheets
The morning she never woke up

Still I couldn't help but notice her
She was fatally beautiful
Ever since she was a girl
She was fatally beautiful

I noticed her
She was fatally beautiful
Ever since she was a girl
She was fatally beautiful
",Fatally Beautiful,1983
T-Bone Burnett,"Somewhere between Never Neverland and Wonderland
In a land called Never Wonderland
There lived a beautiful wealthy young divorceé
With a checkered past and a bad memory
Who should probably remain nameless

And men traveled from far and wide and try to win her hand
And she took in stragglers from all over the known world
Her newest guests were as her mother called them
""The latest Russians to defect""
One's name was Hefner the other's name was Disney

Disney smoked a pipe and was very philosophical
He was constantly surrounded by go go girls
He used to take pictures of them without any clothes on
And sell them to the neighborhood children

Hefner on the other hand was not so introspective
He loved a good story just like anybody else
In fact he loved the myths of Never Wonderland so much
That he made elaborate molded plastic sculptures
Of the characters in the myths

And then he'd set them out in the garden
Until he had built a whole 'nother land in Never Wonderland
Which he called Hefnerland

The neighborhood children loved them
They had lots of fun playing in Hefnerland
And looking at all Disney's go go pictures
Because they didn't know any better
And they didn't know any worse

But the beautiful, wealthy, young divorceé thought
That they were only after her money
Sometimes she even wished they would go back to Russia
But between you and me they were really dupes of the Wicked King
Who wanted to rob the children of their dreams
",Hefner and Disney,1983
T-Bone Burnett,"Way up in the hierarchies
Mr. Big picks up his horn
Floats a note down through the lowlands
And another star is born

Then he turns a deep vermilion
And he deals a little scorn

We're all gonna be geniuses
We're all gonna be famous
We'll all get in the TV business
And move up to New York who can blame us

They tell me way up there they got a man pulls
Fifteen feet of chain out of his brain

Then you better do it right

T-Bone Burnett,"It can kill from any distance but you never see it strike
There isn't any warning, no blinding flash of light
It hits you when your back's turned or when your eyes are closed
There isn't any shelter and it cannot be controlled

It can be as subtle as a whisper in the dark
Or as brutal and as cutting as the teeth of a shark

The murder weapon
The murder weapon

There is no good description for the way it makes you feel
It's as lethal as a stiletto and more easily concealed
It sometimes is strategic and sometimes not at all
But you get caught in the fallout, win, lose or draw

There is no escape except to go completely mad
If it doesn't kill you right at first it makes you wish it had

The murder weapon
The murder weapon

The murder weapon
The murder weapon
",The Murder Weapon,1983
T-Bone Burnett,"I find it hard sometimes to say the way that I feel
I do the very things I hate to do
I act like a child and I'm afraid of what is real
And so I try to cover up the truth

I stumble like a drunk along this crazy path I walk
I have a hundred thousand questions too
I'll go to any length to prove that nothing is my fault
Then later on I will deny the proof

I don't like to win but then again I hate to lose
And in between is something I can't stand
I don't care what you think and I hope that you approve
I am just an ordinary man

Sometimes I want to stop and crawl back into the womb
And sometimes I cannot tell wrong from right
But I ain't gonna quit until I'm laid in my tomb
And even then they better shut it tight
",Shut It Tight,1983
T-Bone Burnett,"As the night falls, as the sun starts to sink
And the street lights blink on the town's yawning
I climb down my stairs to the empty avenue
And follow my shadow till morning

'Cause when the night falls, it falls on me
And when the day breaks, I'm in pieces
When the night falls, it falls on me
And I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely

As I walk past the theaters and stores
And the whores that now work where we first met
I want to hold you so bad that it hurts
And it only gets worse when the sun sets

'Cause when the night falls, it falls on me
And when the day breaks, I'm in pieces
When the night falls, it falls on me
And I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely

And then I see you and call out your name
But down the street you keep walking away
And when I reach you
A stranger looks over her shoulder then it starts all over

Now the moon is a thin silver line
Disappearing behind a skyscraper
And I climb my stairs to my dark hotel room
Through the litter of Sunday newspapers

'Cause when the night falls, it falls on me
And when the day breaks, I'm in pieces
When the night falls, it falls on me
And I'm so lonely

I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely, so lonely
",When the Night Falls,1983
T-Bone Burnett,"He was a strange combination
Part what fathers in movies call a romantic little fool
Part what fathers in Russian novels call a depraved egoist
He won't be missed, I'll persist

First he would fall in love like a building imploding
And not be able to control his emoting
Then he would spend a few speechless weeks
Goggling his beloved and reading Keats and reading Dante's

Next if she gave him a sign, he'd send flowers for a time
Then in one magnificent gesture
He could transform himself into a Bluebeard
But not just an ordinary run of the mill Bluebeard
One who was a lecher then he'll put her out to pasture

What does this have to do with the future?
I'm not too sure
What does this have to do with the present?
It doesn't

Between the Roman churches and the German music halls
Were it not for Mr. Gordon and his fine distillery
I might have never got this far, it would be all the same to me

It started in Bologna when I stepped between the lights
I thought I'd lost my charisma my life flashed before my eyes
The communists rejected me, I didn't fit their plan
And anyway I must assume they're anti-American

It might have been Geneva in a darkened discotheque
And though I met Sophia, I still got it in the neck
A journalist he spied on me like I always knew they would
He wrote me off like a business trip I felt deeply misunderstood

Or maybe it was Paris blazing dignity and pride
It's a city full of heiresses where I very nearly died
I woke up in the circus with a whistling in my ears
I'm ready for the antidote can you tell me what it is

Into the Constitution?
Is this really necessary?
Does this not make you somewhat wary?

And to the laws of nature?
Can we trust this to the legislature?

And shall we trust sin to the wisdom
Of the criminal justice system
Which can't handle the criminals we have now
Why create a whole new class of them?

Isn't crime dealt with by the laws of man?
Isn't sin dealt with by the laws of God?

T-Dub,"I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to pay
Ain't it sad
And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me
That's too bad
In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball

Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
Aha aha
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
It's a rich man's world

A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me
That's too bad
So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same

T-Funk,"She wears a long fur coat of mink
Even in the summer time
Everybody knows from the coy little wink
The girl's got a lot on her mind
She's got
Big thoughts
Big dreams
And a big brown Mercedes sedan
What I think this girl
She really wants is to be in love with a man

She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
Without love it ain't much

She saw him standing in the section marked
""If you have to ask you can't afford it"" lingerie
She threw him bread
And said make me scream
In the dark what could he say
Boys with small talk and small minds
Really don't impress me in bed
She said I need a man's man baby
Diamonds and furs
Love would only conquer my head

She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
Without love it ain't much

They made haste in the brown sedan
They drove to 55 Secret Street
They made love and by the seventh wave
She knew she had a problem
She thought real love is real scary
Money only pays the rent
Love is forever that's all your life
Love is heaven sent
It's glamorous

She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
Without love it ain't much, it ain't much

She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the Glamorous Life

I can't lie, you the one for me
I'm your roof when it rain, be up under me
I'm the one that you come and see, on the late night
Leave when it daylight, see we gon stay tight
Unlike the average dame, you a dime piece
That's why it's all about you, not your hine piece
I know, you feeling that
On the bathroom flo', I'm killing that
You love when I dig in that
It's one thing I can't do, put my wig in that
I'ma chill, that's the next nigga job
I'ma hit you with rock hard broad, and some orge'
Expensive weed, and a throwed massage
That'll make a nigga reach, for a Trojan large
On the lake when it's cold, in the closed garage
You my boo, you a throwed lil broad uh

All the shit you go through, know what you my boo

I put that on Big Rue, and I'ma stomp
 
24 on the phone, I'ma go on home
You still in the jacuzzi, while you pulling on my bone
You know a nigga alone in the streets
If I ain't home, think I'm gone with a freak
Quit blowing up my beeper and my cellular
On the regular, I'm telling you
Keep your head straight, you gon make a nigga head ache
These hoes good for the late, making the bed break
I'm just like Nate, I got hoes
Remember you the one that I chose

[Chorus]
[Big Pokey]
You make a nigga world spin, that's true
You know you my girlfriend, that's you
Whoever would of knew, it must be love
Make a nigga feel like, a lil puppy cause
Every time I look up, you rubbing a nigga
Every five minutes, talking bout you loving a nigga
I bet you had a dozen of niggas, but not me
Them head shots hugging a nigga, mami
One day, we might tie the knot
You might be the one, from the probably lot
Me I'ma ride it out, stay down
First I got some ground rules, I gotta lay down
If you could play bound, then it's on and popping
If not, you gon be long forgotten

I love niggas, because niggas are me. And I should only love that which is me. I love that you niggas go through changes, love that you niggas act, love that you niggas make some plays and shoot the shit. But there's one thing about niggas that I don't love. Niggas are scared of revolution.

[T-K.A.S.H.]

There's a war going on at home
It's like Baghdad
In American cities where all the blacks at
Little kids that pack straps and backpacks
Who clap cats for scratch snacks and gas masks
Hard times
Niggas are on the grind
All of the time
Faith in Allah small as a dime
A cup of noodles for breakfast
A cup of noodles for lunch and
A cup of noodles for dinner
Every day is the Winter
Every day is December
Cause evin in the middle of Summer
The streets shudder from the poverty blizzard
Rocket propelled grenades
Landmines and letterbombs
Open up your envelops
With thoughts of them shuttin off
Your water and your lights
And your foods and your rights
All you got in your life
Is little dude and your wife
So you move in the white
With the crew in the night
But you're nervous:
The block drafted you into the service
The curse

You ain't a made nigga, you just afraid nigga
You ain't a made nigga, you just afraid nigga
You ain't a made nigga, you just afraid nigga
You ain't a made nigga, you just afraid nigga

Wakin' up is the beginning of a day that's fucked
Spoons and forks and napkins and plates and cups
Everything but a meal
I bang with my steel
And feel hunger pains in me still
I hit the front line with my ammo and my canteen
Basketball and tennis shoes as a sand screen
Shootin' jumpers as the boys in blue pass me
Casually
I pass cream to the crack fiends
The other day a first Lieutenant was moded
Started up the car and it exploded
But didn't nobody notice
I'm knowin' how it goes
When if the the nigga with the purple heart of courage ain't the oldest
It's cold shit
But if I let little man push
Little man could go and create a plan to ambush
Double jeopardy
Brothers reppin' me
And tellin' me they lovin' and respectin' me
Could be the death of me

You ain't a made nigga, you just afraid nigga
God in heaven could you tell me why you never chose me
You ain't a made nigga, you just afraid nigga
Times I asked you to provide or we wasn't goin' to eat
You ain't a made nigga, you just afraid nigga
Why was everything that you was supposed to do on me
You ain't a made nigga, you just afraid nigga
Since I'm not in heaven it's only one other place I can be

Now shit's hard, when you're up in rank this far
I hit bars and I mix and mingle with stars
You flip cars with overtime you get scarred
And with your broad you begin to whisper “discharge”
Traumatized by the lies of the turncoats
Who walk enemy ground to go and burn smoke
Five dead single shot glock nine to the head
And you like, “Fuck em'”
Them niggas have to learn though
But things deepen
Your enemy's peepin'
The rate you're gain' weight got your thinergies creepin'
They see you're not sleepin'
So they got reason
To send a soldier in your circle
And manipulate the treason
A psychological Hurricane Katrina
And ain't nobody comin' to help
Fuck FEMA
I slowly turn the gun to myself and squeeze it
And Mohhamed Era Su Allayet (?)
I couldn't see it
The grievous

I didn't create this shit, I was born into it. Like I didn't create the projects, I didn't create homelessness, I didn't create poverty, I didn't create unemployment, I didn't create this poor educational system, I was pushed into it, and now you want to blame me for not rising above it? Shit, I may not be that strong!

Tired of all these wanna-beez
Get away

Plates, nobody knows the name, nobody knows the pain
The fame's last on list
Can't get paid with mic in the syst'
Gotta roll with a goal that swells the pole
These stories are told, when I was like
Ten why-years old, won't be mad if it don't go gold
I could gives a fuck
Still cut my zit, and gives it all to soul
I rocks the mic, like, dyke, hypes, like, pipes
Who got the style, type, like, this, tight, type, tyke?
I'm stronger than straight with no chase
Emcees I step to's like a staircase
Kick em to the bottom like BASS
Let that ink sink into your vellum
Open up your eyes then I swell em

[Chorus: (T-Love) Chali 2na]

Yo some of you brothers be livin lavishly
But it's a travesty
You're selling millions of records
But you a crab emcee
Faking hard as a rock, you just a wimp man please
Your crew is a circus act of chim-pan-zees
There's a disease in your lecture
Lacking extra texture, what you flex neglects to wreck
Got ta execute you pile; and boot the file
When I shoot the style I'm giving root canals
Now which of you punks be amongst me
To let the funk free, I keep my composition junk free
Consistently, like your monthly
Plus I'm scent free, wack emcees can not hunt me, down
Kicking freeze in the sound booth
Wanna-beez, be on they knees to get down
Truth be told, the proof we hold, woke the old
When they made me into an emcee, they broke the mold
Like that

No time's narrowing
I don't be flipping with the heroin, like Errol Flynn

To Malibu, you, can have anything you choose
Yet you all up in this be girl's news
Trying to wear shoes
All up in my mix, waiting for the opportunity
To transfix, to culturist
You want to-be down with the, crews and clicks
But, you can't kick it, why? He's a punk bitch

On the hip, gotta dip
Hollering, calling me out like a Girl Scout
Better go ahead and sell your cookies later
Fuck up out my face, rookie
Took me on a trip away
Chopping trees, eating grits with runny eggs
I'm always tripping on the beggars working the same corner
Trying to vamp me with the creases in your clothes
Sticking cuffs up in my face, don't act
Fumbling, pretty scared like tailbacks they flow
Knees and elbows got drug in the parking lot
So jellybeans (where ya at?) come clean

Limping like Willy, turning bunks face down
On the military campground
And I'm out, nigga

Yeah, all this goddam grinding ain't shit
(Ho hustling) Cause I ain't got nathan to show
Except small quantities of blow
And enough flow to keep my lil boy belly full
But when that little bit run out
Pray your card don't get pulled
Should my path ever be crossed
On my family-feeding missions
Missing persons lives lost, inside edition
Kissing ass on nine-to-fives ain't gon keep me alive
Had to do without a lot still I seem to survive
Tried that straight path with the bow lean

Uplifting words from my soul to keep
And my niggas that fantasize how wide the ride get
The concert, never the need to rob or car jack
The fact is to keep a cool head and chill
And get your Bible, it says thou shalt not kill

Uh, the devil's shot it, human beings robotic

When niggas start disappearing about cloning
Sometimes I feel weak
Mentally I'm one of the firest niggas in the street

Quarter pound of bomb, quarter pound of bud

Whoa, ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of you body tonight.
 
Well I begin the weekend with a groove roll about eight deep now
What's my next move
Wait until night fall so I could enjoy systems
Pump by four Jeeps
running like a convoy roll to the club
Kind of crowded
What a scene
pulling up with Jodeci
Blasting out the fifteen
So I park my ride 
Girls see my gear and notice my grill
Here comes the pointing and staring
 
Ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of your body tonight.
Whoa, ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of you body tonight.
 
Now I sign a couple of autographs
Take a few flicks
Order Dom Perignon and lay back with my chicks
Mike is on the left of me
Smooth is Flipping
Tricky and Moet are on the dance floor ripping
Silk is with a cutie
Big D, I'm trying to find him
Tim is in the front and
Mo'Bettas right behind
and me I'm just laying on the prowl
Guys say what's up as the girls cry aaaahhh
She grabbed her man
I think she tried to play'em
My only thought was to step to the a.m.
'Cause I came to have a good time
and at the end of the night
No doubt I'm gonna get mine
'Cause I don't have to raise my voice to be seen
I maintain if you know what I mean
understand I'm not conceded
Father's just mellow
I'm a smooth dark romeo freak kind of fellow
 
Ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of your body tonight.
Whoa, ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of you body tonight.

Do that dance. Let's work it out.
Do that dance do that dance baby.
 
Do that dance do that dance, baby.
Do that dance. Let's work it out.

Lounging on the d.l.
this type of night is rare
I glance to the right
Oh, who do we have here
Puff and stew gettin' ripped
What the hell
I see Mr. Uptown himself, Andre Harrell
conversating 
with his boys
as they start to barge straight through the crowd
It's time to get charged
It's kinda mello, so I leap to sista' and the soul
rollin' five deep
Mark, Corey, Shakim, L.Q. doin' the wild thing
'cause the soul is true
And every time I hear the music thump-id-dee-thump
and all the girlz gettin' bucked right in your rump
So everybody who feel the mood is right
Get on the dance floor
 
Ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of your body tonight.
Whoa, ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of you body tonight.
Ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of your body tonight.

But girl, you're killing me, I need your energy
You're giving me something I can feel
I feel in the right light
You're looking like a girl I used to date, but now you're in the wife light
Ooh, if you're with it, then I'm with it
We can do it for the Zeitgeist, huh
Girlfriend, girlfriend, turn in for the night right

Hello Ms. Tattoo Girl
You are forever
Stuck with me
Hello Ms. Tattoo Girl
You forever
Stuck with me
 
See everyday I asked a new question
To get right through all life a lessons
It's funny to me and I'm noticing that
Every tattoo I see is on the small of a back
It's like damn I can't refuse
All the great ideas that come with tattoos
Like first the rose, then the butterfly
Then the small little catch themes catch your eyes
And even Angelina Jolie got those
The only way you see those is with no clothes
So there's a few who knows
Maybe Brad Pitt know
Billy Bob saw a few so she got some more
I'm sayin'

Hello Ms. Tattoo Girl
You are forever
Stuck with me
Hello Ms. Tattoo Girl
You are forever
Stuck with me
 
Uh, she got eyes by her pussy
So when I go down they always lookin'
Then I told her get my name
In all red ink, blood game
Then we cut off the night lamp
And I get up on that ass like a tramp stamp
My tattoo goddess
Love is an art and I'm an artist
 
And one of the hot har-hardest tattoos I ever seen
Is the one on my wife, one that you'll never see
It ain't no tiger, no snake, or no key chain
She went to FAMU, so of course she know T-Pain
Strictly simplicity, ink on your tities be wiggly jiggly
You'll never get rid of me, I'm permanently on the arm
So when I'm looking for them tattoos in the bed
I be like?

There you are
Hello Ms. Tattoo Girl
You are forever
Stuck with me
Hello Ms. Tattoo Girl
You are forever
Stuck with me
Stuck with me
Yeah

You got actors, entertainers in blue collar suits
The whole wide world is wearing tattoos
You got athletes and doctors just like you
