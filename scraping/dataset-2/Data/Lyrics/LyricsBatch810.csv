P.M. Dawn,"I'll be waiting for you
Even if it takes you all of your life
I'll be waiting for you
'Til you know within yourself that you are so divine

Baby baby
I know what you want from you
Can you see me?
I'm divinity
And I can mean so much to you
You're like the moon, you're like the stars,
You're like the sun
It'll take more than just a lifetime to understand
Where we are

So patience is nothing
'Cause I'll do anything for you

I'll be waiting for you
Even if it takes you all of your life
I'll be waiting for you
'Til you know within yourself that you are so divine

Baby tell me
Why must there be pain with you
Your precious emotions
When will they be free from you
See you're like the moon, you're like the stars,
You're like the sun
And everything else I need confuses me so much
So

Baby don't hate me
'Cause I've seen better things in you

I'll be waiting for you
Even if it takes you all of your life
I'll be waiting for you
'Til you know within yourself that you are so divine

See you're like the moon, you're like the stars,
You're like the sun
And I can bet that you matter but I'm having too much fun
So
Maybe baby, love will save me
And I can keep your hate from you

I'll be waiting for you
Even if it takes you all of your life
I'll be waiting for you
'Til you know within yourself that you are so divine

[Chorus x2]",I'll Be Waiting for You,1995
P.M. Dawn,"Holy animation, what's a human, what's a lifetime? 
All the angels, praying for me, I'm only human
For a lifetime, what's a lifetime, if you love me? 
For a lifetime, you said you'd love me

Mass producing, more affection, for a human,
For a lifetime, many lifetimes, for a human,
Is it human to, know your your lifetimes? 
What's a lifetime, if you love me? 
What's a lifetime, if you can't love me? 

Sacred introduction, to a human, to a lifetime,
Elevation, turns emotions, into humans
Into lifetimes, what's a lifetime, if you love me? 
For a lifetime, you said you'd love me",A Lifetime,1995
P.M. Dawn,"If you should ever go, don't ever think I'd never miss you
If we should ever say goodbye, what makes you think that I'll survive
Even if you go, I will always be there for you
'Cause when I think of all your reasons why
It only brings tears to my eyes

Without you in my eyes I always find my mind is miles from anything.
Without you in my life I am deep inside miles from anything

Every time you cry, why do I always feel like I let you
If we should ever fade away, how can you think I'd let it stay this way
You don't ever wonder, what this is the future has for me and you
Whenever you look into my eyes, baby, you should understand all inside

Without you in my eyes I always find my mind miles from anything
Without you in my life I am deep inside miles from anything",Miles From Anything,1995
P.M. Dawn,"No, there ain't nothing special 'bout my life, my egoism is so not,
But oh so comfortably confusion ins my life, pleased to meet you baby, baby,
'Cause I've got infinity to bring me a little paradise there you are to kiss me, 
Just you always live right now? 
But I always see you right in the middle of everybody's life, 
Singing everybody wants me there, but everybody wants to put me down

[Chorus]
What could be lonely 'bout you? 
What could be lonely 'bout you baby?
You're immaculately touched, and they love you that much,
Whatever's lonely bout you only makes me totally convinced that
My own personal gravity serves me well.

Why am I always misinterpreting my guilt? 
My happiness makes me sad sometimes,
And I'm no guardian angel but I can loan you mine,
They're tickling all my precious depressions

So melancholy's bringing me a little of what he calls paradise,
I'm bored with my elation, it humors me to tears sometimes,
But always manages to put a little hickey on everybody's mind
Why does everybody want me here, but no one here can give me reasons why.

[Chorus]

Why do I do everything ""dis"" integration likes? 
I'm grieving with my patience's patience,
And all constant information tells me is
No one wants to put me down here
But everyone was dumb enough to come.

[Chorus]",My Own Personal Gravity,1995
P.M. Dawn,"Baby works at the puppet show 
And sometimes I can't go 
Baby plays at the puppet show 
And sometimes I can't go 

I know I can disappear like Shakespeare's Romeo 
I know that good things always treat me bad 
But don't you think it's strange that I don't know? 

Baby works at the puppet show 
And sometimes I don't go 
Baby hurts at the puppet show 
And sometimes I won't go 

If I can't make it disappear then I will have to go 
I wonder if happiness will meet me there 
But classify me strange cause I can't go 

Baby awakes at the puppet show 
And sometimes there's no show 
Baby freaks at the puppet show 
And sometimes there's no show 

I know that I love you but I'm bleeding all I know 
You do a great job of wanting me 
But don't you think its strange I told you so 

Baby works at the puppet show 
And sometimes I can't go 
Baby plays at the puppet show 
And sometimes I can't go 
Baby works at the puppet show 
And sometimes I can't go 
Baby hurts at the puppet show 
And I'm just trying to understand you",The Puppet Show,1995
P.M. Dawn,"I can tell you how I feel about you night and day...
Sometimes I miss you
Sometimes I miss you
Sometimes I miss you
I can tell you how I feel about you night and day...

There are only whispers and shadows for me
The way things are the way things are
And with this I blow a kiss to disaster
Because I wish to perfect my heart...
I gotta check my mind...
Am I in tune with you?
Do we connect within the realm of the gods?
Electric word ""life"" that means forever
and that's a mighty long time when you've kissed
Divine
So divine... as with you
The Christ within will come in the clouds
Trusting ""divinity is always with you""
Trusting ""this is the here and now""
Mercy's right... I gotta check my love
and I'm trying to do as such
I don't let the demons get me down
It's just that sometimes I miss you so much...

Sometimes I miss you
Sometimes I miss you
Sometimes I miss you
I can tell you how I feel about you night and day...

I can envision all things to life
I can understand realistic ways
But I invent the next phase in forever
I like you, rewrite the next page
It's so pristine... It's so untouched
I'm an immaculate sign of devotion
Still unseen... I'm thinking so what
Bless me cursed with colorful emotions
God said ""I guess you don't know I'm you
because you know the entire 360""
A Christ, that's me
the Christ, that's you
Regardless... constantly within me
I'm not so responsible for this
I'm just a man in love with so much
I know love... you'll always be with me
It's just sometimes I miss you so much

Sometimes I miss you
Sometimes I miss you
Sometimes I miss you
I can tell you how I feel about you night and day...

Sometimes I miss you
Sometimes I miss you
Sometimes I miss you
I can tell you how I feel about you night and day...

Sometimes I miss you
Sometimes I miss you
Sometimes I miss you
I can tell you how I feel about you night and day...

Sometimes I miss you
Sometimes I miss you
Sometimes I miss you
I can tell you how I feel about you night and day...

P.M. Dawn,"Sonchyenne, tell me about mankind and all of my lifetimes with you
Dayglow, talk to me about rainbows and all of my lifetimes with you
Earth's Church, tells me I've no worth nor any of my lifetimes with you
But you said you'd show me, all the different sides to you I'll try and understand you
'Cause when you're lied to like I'm lied to all that can connect you is your love
Sonchyenne, tell me about mankind and all of my lifetimes with you
Bright skies, you cry like I cry in all of my lifetimes with you
Light Be, everything inside me through all of my lifetimes with you
But I fear they've no idea, all the other minds in you thinking thoughts for you
When you live not like they do all that can connect you is your love....your love
Sonchyenne, tell me about mankind, and all of my lifetimes with you
You cry like I do, show me what its like in you, 'cause I know why they hate you
When you know one more than they know then all that can connect you is your love
Sonchyenne, tell me about mankind and all of my lifetimes with you",Sonchyenne,1995
P.M. Dawn,"I look through love baby just like you, I hope to be all he wants me to be
So when you run from me I will always understand
But don't you want to know why God loves you?
I think I know how divine you are and I only see what you want me to see
So when you cry a crucifixion I will always comprehend
But will you ever know why god loves you?
I will always love you more because you want to know why God loves
All things in time are shadows as divine
Everything I do I only do through you
Will we all survive all the wonders why
As close as we are everyone's alone
I'm flesh and blood baby just like you, and we're also more than we're able to see
That's why through all your tribulations I will always hold your hand
Because you want to know why God loves you
All things inside are shadows of my lives
Everything you do affects me like I'm you (because I am)
Will we all survive?
No more wondering why because when closeness comes
Oh my God",Why God Loves You,1995
P.M. Dawn,"Legs of a cat
Head of a man
Eyes on the camera
Shaking everyone's hand

Vultures circle
And smack their lips
The sky goes black
As the lightning rips

Stars are new
Born without pity
As waves of blood
Roll over the city 

It's not a rehearsal
Or special effects
It's the end of a story
It's what happens next

If I say, and I say
It's coming in a second
If I say, and I say
In the blink of an eye
And I say, and I say
With a bang and a whimper
And I say it's OK
If you never say goodbye 

Son of a child
Son of a beast
As it slouchers and slithers
It's way from east

I dreamt a dream
But what can it mean
Angels and more
Devoured the queen

All the people danced
And tore at their clothes
The sky caught fire
And the oceans froze

It wasn't a fable
It wasn't a hoax
The servants and the devil
Keep making up jokes

And I say, and I say
It's coming in a second
And I say, and I say
In the blink of an eye
And I say, and I say
With a bang and a whimper
And I say it's OK
If you never say goodbye

I saw a chapel
Lain of God
The light was so blue
And the air was so cold

It sounded high
On a microphone
As the rats kept rhythm
On a chicken bone

People wept
And swallowed their jewels
Entered like soldiers
Departed as fools 

It isn't a sentence
It's not a reward
It's a black parachute
With a noose for a cord

And I say, and I say
It's coming in a second
And I say, and I say
In the blink of an eye
And I say, and I say
With a bang and a whimper
And I say it's OK
If you never say goodbye 

And I say it's OK
If you never say goodbye
And I say it's OK
If you never say goodbye
And I say it's OK
If you never say goodbye",If You Never Say Goodbye,1996
P.M. Dawn,"I ran into my ignorance
I think she cares for you
'Cause she's been trickin' on you for quite some time
You need to tell that bitch to change her fucking frequency
When intellectricity come in mega hurts
I'm not trying not to get amped I'm trying to get you

You
I wanna be like you
I want one of them art deco halos that makes everybody hate how
Far they are from you
I wanna be like you baby
I want one of them art deco halos
Just to emphasize my pain

I used to hydroplane all through my astroplane
But now hating Uncle Sam defeats my crimes
He said ""I ain't got no guilt, so get up out of my face you whore,
'Cause act like you wouldn't like to take my job.""
But he don't know
Nothin' from nothin' leaves you nothin'
That's why he thinks he wins the wars
But it's all that stupid shit, up against my stupid shit
See I don't wanna be me no more
So don't tell me I'm loned
Tell me I'm you

You
I wanna be like you
I want one of them art deco halos that makes everybody hate how
Far they are from you
I wanna be like you baby
I want one of them art deco halos that give everybody else the finger

I ran into Armageddon's tears
And they've got so much love to give
But they just think his love makes the sunshine
I said ""if ya'wl ain't really against me then what's your
Fascination with me""
They said ""you make transformations all the time
Baby I'm here for you""
But he can't do anything for nothing
Anything he got he'll get from you
And all that stupidness gets to be my stupidness
I can't think or wish, but can hate to be just about anything I am
Except for you

I wanna be like you",Art Deco Halos,1998
P.M. Dawn,"Why can't I keep you from the cold
Seem to know the difference faces
No matter what road you travel on
You go through the darkest places

I can't tell the angels it'll be good
For you
But wanting to say blesses be the
Darkness
For bringing the life through

But I'd be lying to myself

I had no right bringing you here
Knowing what I know, feeling the way
I feel
I had no right being so uncontent,
Being so confused,
Being so not for you

You're in love with all that you don't know
It animates your expectations
But what's the easiest way to hurt a man
Give him all he's ever wanted

Trying to tell the angels I don't
Know what to do
While convincing myself to believe
All the sadness have purpose to
Makes me hate this

I had no right bringing you here
Knowing what I know, feeling the
Way I feel
I had no right being so uncontent,
Being so confused,
Being so not for you

And when you asked the angels to
Make you a better you
Dream all you want
Cause all the light you occupy
They will try and take it all from
You

I had no right bringing you here

Being so confused,

P.M. Dawn,"In anything that you do, I will be happy for you, so ecstatic for you
Whatever you are to be, I hope that you'll think of me within your sweetest daydreams
Whenever you decide to die, I hope you're fortified with all you want in life
Whenever you have to change, don't let it make you run away from all that I have to say
Because they'll love you today, when all they really wanna do is ruin everything

I just can't sleep at night
Knowing the wolves are out to get you
And all the hurt awaiting with life
I just can't walk away knowing
The pain might leave you broken

If there's anything you might hate, don't make my mistakes, let it dissipate
All the things you'll go through, I know that they'll punish me more than they punish you
Anytime guilt is felt, don't touch thru no one else, they'll make you hurt yourself
Anything you might see looks that looks like it's defeating me, don't be afraid of these things
Because you're stronger than me, and all they really wanna do is ruin everything

I just can't sleep at night
Knowing the wolves are out to get you
And all the hurt awaiting with life
I just can't walk away knowing
The pain might leave you broken

P.M. Dawn,"I don't kiss the future like the fortune tellers do
So I can't dream with you at night
Pessimism's hunger changes everything
I wish I walked with faith and not by sight but

You know with anything you do
there's a hundred people bringing you down
No matter who you are

Don't let 'em make you cause they'll break you
Don't let 'em love you cause they'll hate you even more

So if no one else believes in you
I'm completely yours, and I've got so much faith in you
No matter what this life puts in front of you
You can save this world
I've got so much faith in you

Anyone who knows you sees the renaissance in you
And I have to try and act surprised
I'm a ""prime demotivator"" says my point of view
I wish I had some cheer to lead you to but...

No matter how much good you do
There's a million people wishing you harm
(I'm telling you) No matter who you are

Don't let 'em make you cause they'll break you
Don't let 'em love you cause they'll hate you even more

So if no one else believes in you
I'm completely yours, and I've got so much faith in you
No matter what this life puts in front of you
You can save this world
I've got so much faith in you

Oooo there's a million things that I could say to you
Oooo don't let 'em change you inside
Because anyone who matters will try to understand who you are

Freedom's only grieving for you now
'Cause I'm not wasting no more lifetimes screaming at me

I can see me now
Kissing and pouring me a bath.
I can hear me now
Telling me I'm alright
Even when I break my heart.
No, there's nothing wrong with this life.
You can put all your worlds on this circle.
I can never kiss me goodbye.
'Cause I'll be spending my whole lifetime 
Screaming at me.

Flesh only matters in life
You can't believe your whole world's on this circle very low.
Spirit's are bleeding from my mind
'Cause I'm just wasting all my lifetimes
Constantly wasting all my lifetimes
I'm just so tired of wasting all my lifetimes
Screaming at me.",Screaming at Me,1998
P.M. Dawn,"I befriended my confusion quite some time ago
She tells me everything is gonna be alright (it's alright)
My senses make it real to me in all types of ways
But I'm so angry at my jealousy
That I hold it inside my heart like it's alright

Catapult my visions into realism's bosoms
Dreams prefer caesarian with plastic spoons and knives
That's what you get when your brain masturbates
There's no pleasure

So when I evacuate my intimate states
While screaming ""Oh how sweet it is to be loved by you""
The dirty rats you shoot me in the ass
So I don't know what happens when I free my mind

Oh, the cuts that you create let me be the martyr
If I started to love you now, there'd be no end to you
Oh, pick up my embrace. It lives without a reason.
'Cause if I killed you now there'd be no end to you.

Cure my house of cards she sends me tears from outerspace
I'm wondering can I not enjoy the pains I find (it's alright)

Mirrors give me confidence in needing myself
But I'm so terrified of being me I get so right

I'm tryin' real hard not to be exactly the way I am
The next time I come here all I'm bringing to this atmosphere
Is the will not to do it again
Understand, I got neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around broke my sacroiliac
Tryin' to keep sealed where this brother's really at
To tell the new millenium ""yo, what da dilly black""
You look cute in your stars and stripes she said are you coming out
Tonight
That's why whom ever loves me will have to be my killer
'Cause here I'm just a slave tryin to be the nigga

Oh, the cuts that you create let me be the martyr
If I started to love you now, there'd be no end to you

If all my senses say no place exists for you
What's the use in holding out my arms

What's the use in floating if all it does is tell
You someone's under you
What's the use in being if I learn to be
Neglectful to all the things

More than likely I'm the one you're living for
If I find out I am then I'll finally understand
When I say
More than likely I'm the one you're living for

What's the use in praying
For all the things that mean so much to none
Of you
What's the use in pouring out my heart into
Situations I could cry thorough
Oh, what's the use in closing all the doors 
That let the loving into you
What's the use of loving If I learn
Not to feel anything at all, even if it means
The most to you
But I can hear me say

Even If you find that I'm transcending most
Of my mind
Through the often closing doors of what's
To come, and what's in store.
Even if because you find I'm spending most
Of my love
To the often closed minds that must require
What you're living for
What's the use in changing (lets go)
To all the hopes that leave you somewhere
Next to lies
What's the use in buying all my time,

Communicate through signs

He who thinks, thinks for himself
A woman on trip, is a hit for the mind
A true composer's hell between tears
Or PM Dawn makes cause for rewind

Megaline drops along upon a thought
A comatose nap might snatch a sandy
I'm so great I amaze myself
Explains, just how vain is vanity

The longest journey is based on a trip
But also starts with a single step
Because Pleasant Valley Sunday is
A grain of salt

But ""now or never's"" a bit hard to accept
Doncha' think?

Problems of the world, lovers, girls, and things of that nature bound
To break my heart
They all show different sides of me, they're all wrapped
Up inside of me
I feel certain awe for/but those who fall to find out they're in the
Shadows in the stars
Even from a watcher's point of view.

Yo the world doesn't pay for what a person knows
And rarely wants to pay for what a person does
But those who care show puzzle and stare
Singin' what it is, is what it was

'Cause he who learns the rules of wisdom
Without transforming it to daily life
Is a bad condition of contradiction
A rap like that can slap back afterlife

All this twists and spins in a whirlwind
And spots the mask as to where it remains
On the opposite lane of a fortress bridge
Or the thought that lives on the positive plane

Doncha' think?

Power to the world, Lover's gold, and bees and nature(?)
Not to break my heart
They all shrunk off inside of me, they're all wrapped
Up inside of me
I feel certain (?), of those who fall upon got the ring of shadow of
My heart
(?) But these are the watcher's point of view

Reality and Death be they accompany life
Eternity and Judgement accompany death
The simplest thing to remember, really
Clog the fog of ""my forget""

Certain little mystery upon mankind lies
Certain arrogance, to the unexplained
Pure imagination is based on fact
Showing the confusion is made to contain

But the true definition of the phrase is a dream
A dream that encloses a question mark
The end of an era in the halls of a mind
That should've been watched and clocked from the start

Doncha' think?

Power to the world, 
Lover's gold, and bees and nature(?)
Not to break my heart
They all shrunk off inside of me, they're all wrapped
Up inside of me
I feel certain (?), of those who fall upon got the ring of shadow of
My heart
(?) But these are the watcher's point of view

Maybe they just wanna twist my finger
Maybe they just wanna break my arm
Maybe they just wanna try and stop me
Maybe they just wanna do me harm
Maybe they don't want my mouth to speak this
Maybe they just wanna quiet momma

But the minute I step to the rhythm of the left
That's the minute that they don't wanna leave me alone

Gonna steal your soul, you just might

You had no idea that Christians could be so hard core
We'll keep you flowing to the rhythm seeking more and more
Can you deal with it? 'cause this is real kid
You must be one in a mil if you can't feel it
How could you feel it boy if you don't move
How could you say you feel it if you don't groove
Just let your spirit go and keep going
Don't even try to stop this flow, it keeps coming

And at the feet of Jesus every knee shall bow 
Of things of heaven, of things of earth and things under this earth 
And at the name of Jesus every tongue shall confess that he is King 
Under God the father 
Christ is king, He is God 
Who do you seek, you deny 
That in the beginning was the word the word was with God 
The word was God, so why do you fight 
Which were born, not of blood 
Nor of the will flesh, nor of the will of man 
But of God the word became flesh 
And dwelt among us and we beheld his glory 
Full of grace and truth 
Who's gonna bow down? Every knee! 
Who's gonna confess? Every tongue! 
Who's gonna bow down? Every knee! 
Who's gonna confess? Every tongue!

Claim the son of man would come with their hands lifted up 
And their eyes to the sky 
They proclaim the name of Jesus Christ

But they know the truth, for he is the truth, desperate is their life 
So what's the use 
Here's one for the phunky drummer 
Keep the rhythm rolling in your face 
I got the bass, without a trace he's going 
He's gone and I'm on the microphone and I'm known to get rough 
So take some time out my rhyme bro and strut your stuff 
Prophets we're four, I show you what's in store 
Give praises to my ring so now, can I get an encore? 
And keep clapping, keep clapping, keep clapping, keep clapping 
Hey, yo what's happening, brothers are getting jacked 
When you step to me with that disrespect 
I think it's time for us to put you evil butt in check 
And if you don't believe me, tell me who is next 
And somebody tell the devil, that his match is met 
From the word of God so you know it's the truth 
And I tell you with power chump, what you gonna do? 
I'll make it known again, that we're just spreading the good news 
And we'll have you crews saying your Jesus is one smooth dude 

Who's gonna bow down? Every knee! 
Who's gonna confess? Every tongue!

Nobody listens, so who can tell my life is just a living hell!

If you could only see the pain and hurt in my soul
But you don't understand me so how could you know
Sometimes it gets so bad I think I'm losing it
Can't get my hand out of life and I'm losing my grip
And when you loose your grip you begin to slip
Death is just waiting one to trip
Heading down the path to nowhere
No one can hear me cause nobody's there
Life gets darker and there is no light at all
When the ways of this world just prepares me for the fall
What can I do what can I say
I don't know love, only hate
What would you do if you were me?
I guess you'll never know
How would it feel to walk in my shoes
A victim of this world only used and abused
Trapped in a box with the walls coming down on me
They say they know how I feel
Let's it end all right now, that's how I feel
Don't have a care in the world, life means nothing
Don't look back, don't look back, just keep running
RUN - keep running
RUN - keep running
How long o Lord? Will you forget me forever?
How long will you hide your face from me?
How long must I wrestle with my thoughts
And everyday have sorrow in my heart
How long will my enemy triumph over me?
Look at me and give me an answer o Lord my God
Give light to my eyes or I'll sleep in death
My enemy will say I overcame him
And my foes will rejoice at my fall
But I still believe in you Lord
And I know You're real, You're so real Lord
Come and take me from this place Lord
Everyday I will follow and see your face Lord
But I trust in your unfailable love
My heart rejoices Your salvation
I will sing to you my Lord

And You're the one who'll set me free

Caught up in this game of life, me against you 
Not doing what I should, just the things that I want to
So wrapped up, terrified of what I become
Outside I'm laughing, inside I'm numb
I can't see the light because it blinds me
Try to forget but my past always reminds me
Exposed, looked on by eyes of grace
I'm so ashamed, Don't look at my face

All I see is your face
All I see is your face

Get up by your strength, I rise up to thee
But I'll stay on my face if you will of me
Shape and Mold me til your though
Humble myself, life laid down before you
I need your wisdom, so the truth I keep on living
And your love will always be a part of me
Can't do a thing, if I ain't living for the kind

Can I rise above anything that gets in my way 
Like words you say, you let your tongue get loose 
And when push comes to shove, I'm not used to walking away 
I keep on looking up, because these times are getting tough 
Tomorrow's gone and it's the same old song 
Father fill my cup, give me strength to power up 
A life to shine, you'r the diamond in this rough

P.O.D.,"In the howling wind comes a stinging rain

Slapping them down

And I can see those fighter planes
Across the mud huts where the children sleep
Through the alleys of a quiet city street
You take the staircase to the first floor
Turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes into a saxophone
And through the walls you hear the city groan
Outside is America

See the rain through a gaping wound
Pounding on the women and children 
Who run
Into the arms

P.O.D.,"Last day of the rest of my life
I wish I would've known
'Cause I would've kissed my mama goodbye

I didn't tell her that I loved her and how much I care
Or thank my pops for all the talks
And all the wisdom he shared

Unaware, I just did what I always do
Everyday, the same routine
Before I skate off to school

But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest
Instead of taking a test
I took two to the chest

Call me blind, but I didn't see it coming
Everybody was running
But I couldn't hear nothing

Except gun blasts, it happened so fast
I didn't really know this kid
He wasn't part of the class

Maybe this kid was reaching out for love
Or maybe for a moment
He forgot who he was
Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged
Whatever it was
I know it's because

We are, We are, the youth of the nation

Little Suzy, she was only twelve
She was given the world
With every chance to excel

Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell
She might act kind of proud
But no respect for herself

She finds love in all the wrong places
The same situations
Just different faces

Changed up her pace since her daddy left her
Too bad he never told her
She deserved much better

Johnny boy always played the fool
He broke all the rules
So you would think he was cool

He was never really one of the guys
No matter how hard he tried
Often thought of suicide

It's kind of hard when you ain't got no friends
He put his life to an end
They might remember him then

You cross the line and there's no turning back
Told the world how he felt
With the sound of a gat

We are, We are, the youth of the nation

Who's to blame for the lives that tragedies claim
No matter what you say
It don't take away the pain

That I feel inside, I'm tired of all the lies
Don't nobody know why
It's the blind leading the blind

I guess that's the way the story goes
Will it ever make sense

There's got to be more to everything

I'm thankful for every breath I take
I won't take it for granted
So I learn from my mistakes
It's beyond my control, sometimes it?s best to let go
Whatever happens in this lifetime
So I trust in love
You have given me peace of mind

[Chorus:]
I feel so alive for the very first time
I can't deny you
I feel so alive
I feel so alive for the very first time 
And I think I can fly

Sunshine upon my face
A new song for me to sing
Tell the world how I feel inside
Even though it might cost me everything
Now that I know this, so beyond, I can't hold this
I can never turn my back away
Now that I've seen you
I can never look away

P.O.D.,"Last day of the rest of my life 
I wish I would've known 
Cause I didn't kiss my mama goodbye 

I didn't tell her that I loved her and how much I care 
Or thank my pops for all the talks 
And all the wisdom he shared 

Unaware, I just did what I always do 
Everyday, the same routine 
Before I skate off to school 

But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest 
Instead of taking a test 
I took two to the chest 

Call me blind, but I didn't see it coming 
Everybody was running 
But I couldn't hear nothing 

Except gun blasts, it happened so fast 
I don't really know this kid 
Even though I sit by him in class 

Maybe this kid was reaching out for love 
Or maybe for a moment 
He forgot who he was 
Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged 
Whatever it was 
I know it's because 

[chorus:]
We are, We are, the youth of the nation 

Little Suzy, she was only twelve 
She was given the world 
With every chance to excel 

Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell 
She might act kind of proud 
But no respect for herself 

She finds love in all the wrong places 
The same situations 
Just different faces 

Changed up her pace since her daddy left her 
Too bad he never told her 
She deserved much better 

Johnny boy always played the fool 
He broke all the rules 
So you would think he was cool 

He was never really one of the guys 
No matter how hard he tried 
Often thought of suicide 

It's kind of hard when you ain't got no friends 
He put his life to an end 
They might remember him then 

You cross the line and there's no turning back 
Told the world how he felt 
With the sound of a gat 

[chorus]
Who's to blame for the lives that tragedies claim 
No matter what you say 
It don't take away the pain

When his money to be made

And why must we kill in the name of what we think is right

The lies on your tongue
A hand that kills the innocence who quit to do wrong
Your belly is full
While we fight for what remains

While the poor become slaves

It makes me wonder.
A state of mind 'cause I'm just fading away
And my head is lost up in the satellites
I'm so far and gone to ever get it right
Through unseeing eyes, day dreaming again

Eternity is seemingly an endless waiting.
Lost in forever
Eternally, a limitless time.
It's never ending
I'm lost in forever

Am I just hanging around all alone in my mindless haze?
It takes me under.
The infinite confined ready to blow you away
I'm too blind to see beyond the dead of night
But my spirit groans to see the after life
I'm so broken and small, come here and take me away

Eternity is seemingly an endless waiting.
Lost in forever
Eternally, a limitless time.

P.O.D.,"You stand with the gun in your hand
Staring at the wall with a look so sad
Thinking about who really cares
And will they even notice if I just disappeared
In one bang, blood rushed to the head
She'd rather fly through the sky than walk with the dead so
She stays high while the world goes by
Just another day here waiting to die

But life is beautiful
Share a little love with the whole wide world
Every boy and girl sing along
When we sing why-o, why-o

And she cries but her man denies
It's funny how love comes with so many lies
He said he'd never do it again
So she puts on a smile and starts to pretend
And she hides all the pain inside
While filling up her arms with pretty little lines
She cuts with no intent to kill
This time she didn't do it
But someday she will

But life is beautiful
So share a little love with the whole wide world
Every boy and girl sing this song
When we sing why-o,

Too angry inside, well so am I

My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Stars are smiling at me from your eyes
Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

P.O.P.,"Hell yeah nigga, ay yo

[Z-Ro:]
Remember me, when I use to write my rhymes in class
At Dick Dall Middle School, all them niggaz would laugh
Telling me I would never make it, cause I rap too fast
I was desperately trying to find out, how to go from scraps to cash
Remember, how y'all use to chase me home from school
Just cause I sported corduroy britches, and Pro Wing shoes
I use to have a lunch card, cause them times was hard
Since the seven people living in one house, with no cars in the yard
I remember stressing so hard, I couldn't keep my focus
My only love was for extras, and overs
Fuck all you niggaz, don't make me slap the fuck out all you niggaz
If it ain't related to making paper, I ain't calling you niggaz
I bet Mo City remember, when I took it over with rapping
51-11 Ridgevan, moving that crack bitch I was stacking
Residuals redeemingly, I was raw mayn raw caine
Rapidly running my neighborhood, I was the law mayn
'Member when I dropped my first album, in '98
Fucking with Herman Fisher, but now that nigga hate me he's a cake
Suppose to be mad at me, tal'n bout I owe him some change
Nigga just mad cause they can't eat with me, I eat with Lil' James
Rap-A-Lot Mafia my man, y'all remember the Maab
This isn't Den-Den and Z-Ro, y'all better remember the squad
Two different labels but the same cable, remember we connected
Woodfair to Missouri City, two block of Screwed Up Texas

[Hook: x2]
Remember me, I'm the one they laughed at in all my classes
They use to rank on my low budget clothes, and my glasses
Remember me, the same one they use to call egghead
Now I play with fed bread, and sleep on Gucci bed spreads

[P.O.P.:]
I remember the winters in the hood, no heat cold nights
No gas no lights, a ghetto low life
So my flow twice as strong, from the memories
I remember when my closest homies, turned to enemies
See niggaz tend to be, down when your bread up
But when you in the quicksand, they frown cause your legs stuck
Yeah I remember that, so you remember this
Hard times be my fuel, so I ain't finna quit
I vividly, R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R
Craig up in the E-R, bloody getting CPR
So before, the reaper come and turn me to a memory
I endlessly spit the heat, for the people to remember me
Me P.O.P., so many forgot bout
But not I, this for those who remember little Popeye
And I remember hot guys, ridiculed the flow
Now I'm front and center nigga, haters finna do me so

[Hook x2]

[Bun B:]
Shit I remember back in the game, it was tough
No matter what a nigga had, it was never enough
See if I had five I wanted ten, and if I had ten I wanted twenty
Fuck having some, shit I wanted plenty
Back in the gap, when I first hit the block
With my first 25, and a hand full of rocks
Posted up at Samantha house on the West, on the porch
Ready to give my nigga some work, or give him the torch
I remember telling my T, I wasn't going to college
And was headed to the streets, to get the rest of my knowledge
That broke her heart, and for that I had to go
So I went from the sidelines, to starring in the show
Everything came slow, and nothing came fast
Most times I was out of luck, and dead on my ass
But with the heart of a hustler, and the mind of a G
I came up, now I'm something to see Bun B

P.O.R.N.,"[Chorus]
And the radio daze kept us in the dark
And the satellite age brings us to the light
Some feeling the pinch, some feeling the bite
They ain't ready to talk, they're ready to fight
Never leave you alone
(Never, never leave you alone
Never, never leave you alone)
Never leave you alone
(Never, never leave you alone
Never, never leave you alone)

Yo, so what you searching for? From birth
Born hurting and yearning for certain somethings
Lurking and murk them, got them turning this
Bed into a coffin, burning over passions in this passion
Or more or less over what the pastor passed us
'Cause, see, the past tense it never really passes
Phases that trap us and cage us like classes
Fogging my glasses, lost in a mass mess
Task-less dilemma to match somebody's status
And I'm average as fuck, no car cats gassing me up
Passing bucks like a casual blunt
Granted, hustling habits on the stumble, the mansion while
Bums pass, asking for a buck for some bagged bricks
Bad shit going down on the daily
While bad chicks pass in a Mercedez, damn
They say he's the bastard for chasing them
Maybe it's the patterns that make me that made me crazy

[Chorus]

Life is fiction, competition, and contradiction
Petty perceptions, window dressing for misdirection
Love is a lotto; I know I know you know what I know
Hope is so hollow--that's why winos follow the bottle
And people pressure make death a hidden treasure
A girly pleasure, lonely language inside a letter
It's now or never--move it, move it, love it, or lose it
'Fore it's recruited, then included inside the stupid
It's things of nature; paid a player and say your prayers
Naysayers, the haters, the major players, the beggars
You 'bout it, 'bout it; don't allow it to pop without it
Then those who doubt it do or die the death of cowards
The world is yours and the world we can't afford
So ignore the law; start a fire; then start a war
If you're sick and tired of your access denied
Free will died long before Glydes and i-Pod

[Chorus]

[Black Thought]
Yo, it's too much strain, phenomenal gain
I'm going through things, headaches, abdominal pain
Tryna numb it with that kettle like I'm from the Ukraine
Check the blue flame; lighter running out of butane
What's up with my destructive urge that's unproductive?
Choices I'm stuck with, now starting to fuck with
Contaminating family and close friends
Telling me to stop burning the candle at both ends
Ain't like I'm on a coke binge, hanging in dope dens
Or life is just a pool of Patron I'm soaked in
The darker the covenant-slash-train-wreck for you to rubberneck
You ain't felt the true pain yet so you be loving that
Hit me up at black dot gov like the government
Banana Republican, alien intelligence
Kill switch, real pissed, thinking of some ill shit
The stone the builder refused he need to build with
Got immunized for both flus; I'm still sick
Via satellite, radio, the realness

P.O.S,"I am P.O.S.
I be the new generation of slaves
Here to make papes off this land corporation's rape
From that life I'm tryin' to separate
But I guess I'm livin' dreams cuz my rent's always a month late
Product of an East German black 
Who kissed the neck, of a pretty woman named Grace
But he left my life just a little too soon
Didn't see me catch the Doomtree fame

As we go a little somethin' like this
Look mom, no protection, no I got a baby boy by the name of Jake
And I been tryin' to play the cowboy to rustle in the dough
When I think I'm getting' better every passin' day
I'm not an early bird, plus the feathers' all black
So by the time I catch an apple, usually it's rind
But it's a must to decipher one's girl 
From the round, sweet apples that are rotten on the inside
I cherish my free time
But I maximize so my soul needs to unwind
I wanna see the stars be the moon to my sun
(But I'm always on the run, run, run)
I fake to all these hard-case kids
I raise a black fist
But won't say (nigga) in the things I write
And I don't say (faggot)
Cuz I don't think it's right
I know my boy struggle with that for over half his life
I guess we got our own lives to live
But I'm stretched too thin, tryin' to build a kingdom to rule
And I think to the past sometimes
And dag man, it's bad, see I kinda acted like a fool
But I've apologized to the lives that I've touched 
Wrong pride, to the back, move ahead strong
But I can safely say
I've never played a woman without karma catchin' up later on
I try to walk the right side of the tracks
But I've hopped a couple trains
Mom would cry if she knew the haps
But I can stand who I am
And face the day straight
Knowin' not a thing can change what our beat singin?

[Chourus]
No one will ever be, like me
No one will ever be, like me

And I know I'm not a bad guy, but when I try to do what's right
Everyone who comes to me don't understand or see my plight
Everything I've ever done, and all the plans I've had inside
I was Mr. Gone Wrong in way, so I gave up and said

(Alright)
So now I do what I can, I'm
(Alright)
Stand up like Mama raised me
(Alright)
I was dope from the bottom
And pulled a flush
I've been livin with my chips all in
And I'm still in see

I am P.O.S.

And lookin' back it seems I've always been a step behind
Little off-track and feelin' no one shared a frame but mine
Listenin' to records in my room to escape
Found some things I could relate with, I wore out the tape
We said

When I lose, every time I win, cuz
No one will ever be,
Messin' up stuff or doin' things wrong
Quite like me

Tuggin' all on my Avirex clothes
A young brown Mafioso, I put my foot through the door
Infrared light smilin' title, desert eagle 4-4
Layin' Cubans on the floor, 
I send my ghetto troopers to the mother load 
To snatch a bottle of A-1 yo,
I'm hearin' rapid fire through the house

Me and my soldiers ain't scared,
You get a bullet to the head in trainin' if you don't aim for the head
So I know my young shooters left somebody dead around the corner
Plus got the yola out the trunk bendin' over
Its daytime I can't wait till it turns to night 
Cause that's the time when ghetto stars come out and shine

Quicker than outlaws I draw on haters with glocks and techs
Buckin' at undercover agents dippin' off quick in the lex
That's my trigger finger fuck 'em lets bring the heat to the street
Gave him one to the head and there he dead eternally asleep
Deep in this cold world where there's no love, what the fuck should I do?
People be killin' they family for yola not trustin' in you
But now I'm teachin' you some ackrite 
With forty-fives and flashlights
Fuckin' around with thug niggas
And drug dealers
Manajetuahs and jaguars getting chopped in the drop
Killin' haters that act hard nigga like it or not
Cause it's a hold up, your hands go up real slow
Should've told ya that I'm a soldier who kills hoes
Pullin' no mercy on these busters ain't no callin' the cops
And my nine is comin' to fuck you nigga ballin' or not

I'm off in this shit like Mr. Hanky, Janky, but when it gets stanky
Time to rape fiends, my niggas take G's, make G's, but it ain't free
Pimp niggas laced me when I was a baby, how to slang D
And stained me, a suck ya up nigga lip locked but I can't speak
Now it's crazy, niggas be lazy, imbecilic, milli vanillic, 
Can't speak on it but I feel it, I'm the villain stealin' scrillion
Convo be thrillin' your brain waves get to healin'
Just to reach out and touch you 
train of thought make a killin', Soldiers willin', 
So I do it for thug niggas and drug dealers through the snow and rain
Focused on fetti fuck how it came, steady remain
Paper over hoes, and stay on my toes 
And air these niggas out like sandals, 
Blow 'em out like candles
Handle my business and listen to my theezo

Somebody will sweep you off your feet someday
That's what I hoped would happen with you
More than you could know

I wanted to tell you that my hearts in your hands,
I prayed for the day that I would get the chance
Just when I worked up the courage to try
Much to my surprise
You had somebody else, 
Cause these feelings I keep to myself

I may never get to hold you, so tight
I may never get to kiss you, goodnight
I may never get look deep in your eyes, or so it seems
I always will be wishing
You were mine

All the happiness that I could find
Baby, a girl can dream

Welcome to the album!!!",Intro,2007
Pa,"[Chorus: x4]
Y'all don't know a thing, about my life
(my life) my life (my life)

In my life, a lot of haters talking shit
And I might, expose you hoes you out this bitch
And I ride, with the nine I won't fall or slip
If I die, they still will not get off my dick
But I try, to survive like Destiny's Child
And I smile, cause they been trying to test me a while
But I cry, cause not all my partnas alive
But I smile, cause I know all my partnas with God
In my life, a lot of haters baller blocking my shine
I stay calm, even though I ought to drop em a nine
In my life, I make cash using hoes
And my Sprite, is purple so I'm moving slow
On my side, my dogs moving rocks and hay
And I slide, by how I'm chopping blades
When I drive, I got a big cup of syrup
When I glide, I ride with a couple birds
In my life, I feel like I stand alone
But you still wouldn't leave, out of San Anton'
When I die, don't cry get high for me
So you can feel, like you flying in the sky with me

[Chorus: x4]

In my life, I went from a straw hat to a crown
I been through a few up's, and a whole lot of downs
I take the good with the bad, however the ball bounce
And lately, I've been walking on dangerous ground
It feels like my own partnas, don't want me around
Cause everybody in my crew, be trying to argue me down
They telling me I changed, and I'm not the same
But for the past three years, I've been saying the same thang
I've done a lot of dirt, but I don't brag about it
And since I don't rap about it, you don't know jack about it
People see me being friendly, and they think they know me
But just cause I shake your hand, don't mean you my homie
I got a personality complex, man I'm so complex
But if you come with plex, this ain't fun plex
I'm walking straight, but my mind's in a maze
The only thing that I'm afraid of, is being afraid
I done stared death in the face, I ain't budge one inch
He here beating up myself, and I still don't flinch
Somebody pinch me, I hope I'm dreaming
I'm searching inside my heart, trying to find the meaning of my life

[Chorus: x4]

Y'all don't know shit, about my life
It ain't all about the hoes, gold and ice
I go from down to up, up to down
In a blink of an eye, smiles turn to frowns
Kings get crowned, the rich get rich
Where everybody live, screaming life is a bitch
I ball in the mix, and keep to myself
I don't just want to be, another book on the shelf
A lot of y'all fakers, faking the game
I'm one of the real niggas, that's bringing the pain
I've seen hard times, so I spit hard rhymes
I've been around, different people of all kinds
And to this day, I got a few riddle friends
Too many of y'all, that's so fake and pretend
To be what you not, that's why you get got
Don't fuck with my life, that's all that I got

My life-my life-my life-my life, is all I got
Fuck with my life-my life-my life-my life, and you will get dropped

Ich würde zum Desperado weil ich das Leid gesehen hab
Wenn du kein Bruder bist zähl ich dich zu meinen Gegner
Es sind die kleine Fehler die dich zu einem Mann formen
Ich wollte hoch und mein Hass war der Ansporn
In meiner gang nehmen sie mich Paco Ramires
Weil dieses Gehirn funktioniert wie eine komplette Firma
Ich war hungrig eine der wenigen der wusste was die Vernunft bring
überall zog ich meine Jungs mit
Leider zeigte die Zeit beiden das du ein Hund bist
Puto Noch ein Wort und sieh zeichnen dein Umriss
So viele Chivatos die ich in mein Leben traf ich bereue jeden Tag jede tat jedes Mal
Wenn ich in das Feuer sprang für ein dieser Drecks wesen
Ich bin anders Leute wer von euch will jetzt reden
Wer von diesen Hurensöhne will mir kein Respekt geben
Wir sind die Wahrheit zwischen den lügen dieser Rap Szene
Standhaft ihr macht alle krampfhaft auf ganz krass
Sei ein Desperado und du siehst wie es ein Mann macht
Im dunklen an den Parkstangen siehst du denn pump in meinen Adern
Wir meditieren hier den ganzen Tag lang
Jeder will den Kuchen umgeben von versuchen
Für jeden scheiß Pain in meinen Leben wirst du bluten
Verwandt mit der Hantel im Kampf unser Bande
Ein Leben für denn tot Bruder Sangre pro Sangre

Ich wurde zum Desperado als ich verraten wurde
Ich habe Rache geschworen für meinen Namen Hombre
Für jede träne meiner Mutter weint deine zwei
Ernesto Carlos gibt den Feind keine Zeit
Gib einen Kind ne knarre und der ist krasser
Als jeder breit gebauter anabol motherfucker
In dieser Welt brauchst du harte Eier
Solange Krieg herrscht du Schlampe
Will ich keine Party feiern
Ich bin da draußen und verschaffe mir Respekt
Diggah was ist jetzt Gjana Khan Dirty X Bodycheck
Leg mal deine Waffe weg ich mach bei jeden der Kanacken stress
Das hier nimmt dein Leben wie ne Packung Meth
Digitaler Massencrash cash machen digital
Che Guevaras flamme brennt vor dir stet der General
Ich gebe gas und ich schleife grad die Machete scharf
Ich schlag mir die Wege frei und starte den gegen Schlag
Meine Soldaten warten nur auf mein Handzeichen
Damit sie wissen wann sie angreifen
Du bist ganz leise wenn ich komme und dich zusammen scheiße
Und dir dein scheiß iPhone gegen die wand schmeiße
Eine dickere wand breite die Gun ballert
Ich lasse dich Lambada tanzen du Bandala
Ab Heute bin ich ein ganz anderer Man baba und tätowiere mir

Wir sind Gottes schönstes Geschöpf
Aber zu dumm für die Welt, zu dumm für das Leben
Wir werden ohne Grund zu Rebellen
Wir jagen jeden Tag das dunkele Geld
Weil das Gefühl von Macht unsere Welt
Für eine Sekunde erhellt
Wir führen Kriege für Grenzen
Wie wir uns selber schufen

Wollen wir alle an den selben Kuchen

Und gewissenslos, Blicke tot
Innerlich sind Risse groß

Der noch leuchtet, das Fernsehen ist käuflich
Die Medien ein Werkzeug vom Teufel, Wahrheiten werden verleugnet
Für euch ist die Erde nur Beute, der Mensch ist bereit
Für die Gier zu töten, und deshalb wird die Welt regiert vom Bösen

Haben probiert noch so vieles zu retten, 
Aber die Hoffnung war das schwächste Glied in der Kette 
Es wird Zeit jetzt ein Schlussstrich zu ziehen, 
Wir beide haben diesen Druck nicht verdient 
Wir spielen's immer nur den anderen vor, 
Aber haben den Respekt voreinander verloren 
Es sind Jahre, die mittlerweile wie Tage vergehen 
Um das ganze zu retten hat uns die Erfahrung gefehlt 
Wir leben einfach vor uns hin, 
Aneinander vorbei und was uns hält ist die Erinnerung an andere Zeiten 
Du sagst ich würde Dich betrügen und belügen, 
Gebrochen sind die Flügel, die uns damals glücklich machten Engel, 
Heute sind wir wütend Probleme die genügen 
Ich würde gerne kämpfen aber ich bin müde

Mittlerweile sind wir all die Klippen gewohnt, 
Deshalb kehren wir um und unsere Schritte sind groß 
Warum wurden wir nicht von den Blicken verschont Lass bitte los, 
Lass bitte loos Ich lass dich los, Du hältst mich fest, 
Ich reiß mich los, hab die Segel gesetzt 
Auch wenns nicht einfach ist zu glauben, 
Rollende Tränen aus deinen Augen,? im Kopf niemals vergehen.

Ich guck dich heute an und kann nur Leere sehen, 
Es wäre besser wenn wir jetzt getrennte Wege gehen 
Haben das Vertrauen zueinander verloren 
Und träumen beide insgeheim von einem anderen Ort 
Fühlen uns beide wie gefangen unser Lächeln vereist,
Wir müssen uns von diesen Fesseln befreien, 
Sehnen uns beide nach ner besseren Zeit und irgendwann sind die schlaflosen Nächte vorbei 
Sehe unsere Herzen so wie Schiffe in mitten spitzer Klippen zerbrechen, 
Träume davon die bittersüßen Tränen von deinen Lippen zu schmecken
Egal was noch passiert, nein ich würde niemals daran denken Dich zu vergessen, 
Mittlerweile ist so viel Zeit vergang, 
Ich pack die Koffer jetzt und nehm mir meine Sachen gefaltet aus dem Kleiderschrank 
Schreibe wie von Geisterhand denn heute fühlt sich der Platz an deiner Seite nicht mehr wie Heimat an

Viel zu oft war ich nicht da und habe dich belogen
Mittlerweile ist dein Herz so verletzt
In Wahrheit, Engel wärst du perfekt, aber ich habe dein Wert nie geschätzt

Und warf dir vor du würdest meine Träume nicht verstehen

Konnte dir keine Liebe zeigen, nicht mal in schlechten Zeiten

Sei noch einmal an meiner Seite und ich kämpfe für dein Lächeln, Kleines

Man ich habe dich gequält, war so verschlossen und gab dir keinen Halt
Du hast was besseres verdient, ich war so eiskalt
Wolltest du mal reden hab ich jedes mal die Flucht ergriffen
Und dir somit dein Herz aus deiner Brust gerissen
Heute bleibt mir nix außer dein Duft im Kissen, denn wir haben Schluss inzwischen
Weil du immer denkst, dass ich auf Tour bin und mit Nutten ficke

Du bist kein guter Mensch, du bist nur vom Ruhm geblendet
Deine Liebe ist 'ne Lüge, die du selber glaubst
Und deshalb hast du nichts verloren in meinem Elternhaus
Mit jedem deiner Abonnenten sinkt dein Wert bei mir
Bitte rede nicht und behalte dein Herz bei dir

Angekommen auf einem Schlauchboot
An der Küste in den Zug gestiegen
Während sie in seiner Heimat Blut vergießen
Auf diesem Boden sucht er Frieden
Bruderliebe, aber leider sind wir zu verschieden
Mit seiner Tochter Ayşe und seinem Sohn Musa
Will er nur ins Ruhrgebiet zu seinem großen Bruder
Sie sind in Sicherheit nach einem harten Weg
Doch in den Augen seiner Kinder kann man Narben sehen
Ayşe ist noch klein, zu jung, um zu verstehen
Aber Musa weiß, er wird seine Mutter nicht mehr sehen (nein)
Der Vater kämpft und baut für sie ein Leben auf
Er integriert sich und macht die ersten Läden auf
Schlägt seine Kinder nie, egal, wie laut der Ton wurd'

Kollaterale Schäden
Viele denken, wenn Granaten reden, wird ihn' ein Platz bei Allah gegeben
Das hat nichts zu tun mit der Realität
Aber eines Tages sagen wir „Es war zu spät!“

Nach zehn Jahren ist die Erinnerung ein kühler Fleck
Aber im Großen und Ganzen sind sie drüber weg
Außer Musa er war politikbesessen
Zwanzig Jahre alt und im Innern wie zerfressen
Er schreit die Lehrer an und spricht seine Meinung aus
Ihn interessieren keine Partys und auch keine Frauen
Kam in die Disco nie rein und hat sich dran gewöhnt
Als sie grade neu kamen, fand er dieses Land so schön
Nun merkte er, wie ihn die Menschen auf der Straße sehen
Sie wollen Flüchtlinge tot und wählen AfD
Dieselben Menschen, die die Bomben in sein Land brachten
Ab jetzt konnte man alles mit sei'm Verstand machen
Er trägt das Bild seiner Mutter in der Brieftasche
„Sie wär' stolz, wenn ich Krieg mache!“
Die Menschen haben alles, aber du bist tot
Bevor hier einer stirbt, lass' ich dein Blut nicht los

Ursprünglich war die Welt ein unbegrenzter Lebensort

Und was er wollte, war das Gegenteil von diesem Ende
Doch die Erinnerung kann man nicht retuschieren
Die Toten, die wir lieben, sind im Körper betoniert
Auch wenn du die Wahrheit mit einer Lüge dekorierst

Wir warten draußen auf den Bus
Die Geschäfte vom Teufel laufen in den Clubs
Siehst du, wie der Bruder mit dem Crackshit in Packs tickt?
Und seine arme Mutter unermesslich verletzt ist?
Wir gehen hier unter zwischen Netflix und Rapshit
Hyänen werden wach, wenn dein Geschäft nicht verdeckt ist
Auch wenn ich jetzt im Benz 63er S sitz’
Werden wir noch immer auf der Blacklist verdächtigt
Leb’ an einem Ort, wo man dich treffsicher wegknipst
Hektik dann, wenn das Gesetz dich ins Bett schickt
Guck, ich sah, wie Kräftige ängstlich geworden sind
Im letzten Gefängnis, setz dich und denk mit
Süchtige Perlen pumpen Gift in dein Herz
Um den Code zu entschlüsseln, ist die Schrift zu verzerrt
Du zerbrichst an dem Schmerz, es trifft dich zu sehr
Dein Lachen ist gefälscht, die Gesichter sind leer
Was haben wir aus der Geschichte gelernt?
Ohne Kugel im Lauf bist du nichts wert!

Diese Welt nimmt ein Ende in Kauf
Und an manchen Tagen fängt sie dich auf
Mit dem Stift an die Wand, Kippe oder Blunt?
Ich zünde sie mir an und ich puste aus
Und ich puste aus, puste aus
Und ich puste aus
Und ich puste aus, puste aus
Und ich puste aus",Puste Aus,2016
PA Sports,"Es ging los, Bruder, 2010
Viele kam viele ging, aber scheiß mal auf jeden
Denn ich strebte nach dem Glück in einer Zeit, in der das Leben zuschlug
Ich wurde härter und bemerkte, dass die Schläge gut tun
Ohne Dīn, ich war bereit, allein zu gehn
Keiner hat sich dafür interessiert, wie's mit uns weitergeht
Während andere Scheine zähl'n, durften wir nur scheißt sehen
Ich lernte Kianush kenn' und gründete dann Life is Pain
Finanzierte alles mit Straßengeldern wie Eazy-E
War auf mich allein gestellt, keiner wollte investieren
Keiner hat mein Ding gepusht, jeder wollte Money sehen
Bei vielen war es Image, doch bei uns zählt nur die Qualität
KC war dabei, aber Kianush wurde inhaftiert
Top-100 in den Charts und wir beide sind platziert
Aus puren Emotionen wurden später harte Songs
KC und PA die Geschichte, sie hat grad begonnen

Ich achte auf das Navi und halte meine Route
Denn alles ist gechillt, solang' die Alben in hier wie Coups sind
Atme ein und nick' mit meinem Kopf mit zum Beat
Das bin ich, PA Sports, die Schocktherapie
Wer ist jetzt die Nummer Eins? Ich bezichtige den Part
Denn rapp' ich heute, dass ich King bin, ist das nicht nur so gesagt
Ich puste aus und komme doch an mein Ziel
Das bin ich, PA Sports, die Schocktherapie

Wir warn gehyped, in unserm Leben kam die Kehrtwende
Draußen in der Hood, wo uns die Pussies hinterher renn
Mit bisschen Fame hatten wir mehr Frauen aus eure Stars
(Beutejagd) Diese beiden holen sich die deutschen Charts
Kohle wurde knapp und deshalb mussten wir Verträge signen
Nach eine Ewigkeit hat sich unser Weg entzweit
(2012) Ich war abgefuckt vom Rapgeschehen
Weil die meisten Rapper nur noch Scheiße in den Texten reden
Bin ich heute ehrlich, Chabo, war auch bisschen Frust dabei
Denn obwohl ich berühmt war, musste ich Drogen in der Hood verteilen
Spürte diese Wut in meinem Brustbereich
Ich ging voller Druck ans Mic, um deutschem Rap zu sagen, dass er Pussy bleibt
Machtwechsel hat mich in die Top-20 reingebracht
Kianush ist raus gekommen nach drei Jahren Einzelhaft
H.A.Z.E Platz 7 und die Hütte brennt
Mit dem Desperadoz-Tape lerntet ihr das Fürchten kenn'

Ich achte auf das Navi und halte meine Route
Denn alles ist gechillt, solang' die Alben in hier wie Coups sind

Denn rapp' ich heute, dass ich King bin, ist das nicht nur so gesagt
Ich puste aus und komme doch an mein Ziel
Das bin ich, PA Sports, die Schocktherapie

Platz 6, Eiskalter Engel, mein Zenit
Denkst du ich bin Rap und brenne für das Spiel?
Schießt du auch auf meine Beine, werd' ich rennen bis ans Ziel
Bin ein Monster in der Booth und verbrenne mein Ventil
Ging mit KC auf die Bühne und verspürte das Gefühl wieder
Spiel die erste Solotour und spreizte meine Flügel, Bruder
Kianush brachte das entscheidende Szenario
Wenn ich heute nachfrage, sagt er „Das war gar nichts, Bro!“
Newcomer Number One, Life is Pain ist offiziell
Und im Gegensatz zu vielen sind wir immer noch wir selbst
Zwei Brüder aus dem Ghetto, die denselben Traum hatten
Keiner kann uns was, solange wir aufeinander aufpassen
Scheine waren für uns immer Nebensache, doch es fließt
Wichtig war nur das ich jeden Rapper ficke, Objektiv
Und bei der Planung die wir haben kriegt ihr Bauchschmerz
Denn die letzten Jahre waren grade mal zum aufwärm'

Nur für den Fall, dass ich später ma' weg bin
Du bist nicht mal geboren
Aber bitte mach aus deinem Leben das Beste
Du bist der Sohn einer guten Familie
Denk immer dran wir sind fair und korrekt
Dir bleiben nur Taten, wenn irgendwann der Tag kommt
Weil jeder Mensch diese Erde verlässt
Glaub nicht an alles, was draußen erzählt wird
Bitte denk nie, ein Mann müsste bellen
Denn der einzige Kampf
Der dich zu einem Mann machen kann
Ist der Kampf mit dir selbst
Bitte gib jeder Frau, die's verdient hat
Immer den Respekt deiner Mum
Denk immer dran, deine Schwester zu wahren
Nimm sie fest in den Arm, verletzt sein ist hart
Dein Herz wird gebrochen, tausende Male
Aber du musst immer weiter lieben
Wahre Männer lassen Insekten weiterfliegen
Aber würden auch nie vorm Kaiser kriechen
Kämpf für dein Brot, kämpf für dein Recht
Groß werden ist ein mutiger Traum
Und wenn dir irgendjemand Schmerzen zufügt
Dann geh zurück und heb dein Blut wieder auf
Jeder muss die Werte des Lebens erkennen
Es geht nicht darum, ein' Mercedes zu lenken
Doch berührst du die Seele deines Nächsten mit Händen
Bewegst du die Menschen
Steh und bekämpf deine ganzen Dämone
Dieses Leben ist ein Krieg mit der Zeit
Trag meine Worte für immer bei dir
Ganz egal, wann dieser Brief dich erreicht

Ich warte schon so lang auf diese eine Begegnung
Wenn der Tag kommt, bitte keine Verspätung
Ich würde sterben für deine Genesung
Ich weiß, wer du bist

Ich schreib' dir den Brief
Nur für den Fall, dass ich später mal weg bin
Pass bitte gut auf
Oftmals werden wir umgeben von Wespen
Viele fordern dich heraus, deine Ehre zu testen
Aber Junge, glaub mir
Nur für die Familie ist man bereit
Mit seinem Leben zu kämpfen
Verstehst du mein Denken?
Du kannst dir Reichtum bauen wie du willst
Denk immer dran, es gibt Menschen da draußen im Müll
Ab und zu tut es gut
Einer anderen Person ihren Traum zu erfüllen
Dein Vater war Jemand, du wirst es auch sein
Achte nur auf jeden einzelnen Baustein
Verschwende nie dein Talent
Vielleicht würde genau dieser dein Traum sein
Alles, was ich dir grade aufzeig'
Ist die Realität, mit der ich Krieg gemacht hab'
Trage viele Laster
Weil ich grade diesen Gegner nie gepackt hab'
Psychiatrieverdacht gab's
Meine Worte sollen aufmunternd sein
Junge, richte dein' Fokus auf Traum Nummer Eins
Kumpel, halte Respekt
Aber hab die Augen offen bei den Frauen unserer Zeit
Denk an dein' Glauben bei jeder Entscheidung
Ob gut oder schlecht (gut oder schlecht)
Ich bin niemand vor Gott
Wenn er dich brennen lässt
Kann ich dich vor dieser Glut nicht mehr retten

Solange wie wir leben Krieg mit der Zeit

Und haben früh gesehen, dass unsre Helden weinen

Mir war schon immer scheißegal, was meine Lehrer sagten
Mir wurd' nur schnell bewusst, die Schule macht meinen Traum nicht wahr

Ich drück' aufs Gas und lass' die Reifen quietschen
Meine Wunden bleiben offen, hat die Zeit bewiesen
Der Schmuck an meinem Körper kostet um die dreißig Riesen
Er verändert nichts, doch er gibt mir meinen Frieden
Schüsse fallen, Steine fliegen

Um sieben in der Früh kämpf' ich grade mit den Tränen
Fragen, die mich quälen, denn wir beide haben versagt
Es war leider nicht geplant, doch wir streiten jeden Tag
Ich kann mich noch gut daran erinnern, wie der Doktor kam
Und meine Mutter sagte „Guck mal, deine Tochter, Parham!“
Du warst ein kleiner Engel, ich nahm deine weichen Hände
Küsste sie und schwur mir fest, dass ich für uns drei kämpfe
Wollten Familie sein, doch wir haben's nicht geschafft
Denn der Teufel hat uns beide fest im Griff gehabt
Wir waren verrückt und haben uns gegenseitig krank gemacht
Um den Verstand gebracht, ich hab' nie wie ein Mann gedacht
Aber bitte denke nie, dass Papa dich nicht haben wollte
Nur weil ich die Scheiße nicht mehr weiterhin ertragen konnte
Ich war am ersticken, Baby, und spürte den festen Druck
Aber mit der Zeit ging unser Respekt kaputt
Ich würd' dir so gerne sagen, wo ich grade bin
Aber unsere vier Wände wurden zu 'nem Labyrinth
Ich hab' mich verlaufen und verloren
Mir liegt viel auf meinem Herzen, aber wenn ich rede, glaubt ihr mir kein Wort
Ich bin ein Ehrenmann und war bereit den Weg zu gehen
Aber mit dem Alter konntest du unsere Probleme sehen
Mir taten deine Tränen weh, deshalb hab' ich fest geschworen
Ich müsste gehen und hier Zuhause wird ein besserer Ort

Ich wach' an deinem Bett und zähl' deine Tränen
Auch wenn du mich nicht sehen kannst Kleines, schlaf! Papa geht es okay
Ich würde gern dabei sein und dich begleiten auf dem Weg, den du gehst
Aber Liebe wurde Krieg und diese Träne wirst du später verstehen

Es klingt hart, doch wir haben nix zu reden
Ich bezahlte mit mei'm Leben für die damaligen Fehler
Aber keiner von uns beiden hat die Scheiße hier verdient
Mit gegenseitigem Bekriegen erreichen wir nicht viel
Dein allererster Tag im Kindergarten und ich war nicht da
Obwohl du in den ersten Jahren nur in meine Arme kamst
Ja, ich bin dir fremd geworden und es tut ziemlich weh
Aber bin so stolz, wenn ich heute höre, wie du redest
Wie du gehst, wie du dich bewegst und wie klug du bist
Ohne dich verblute ich als ob mich eine Kugel trifft
Es gibt keine Schuldigen, wir sind beide jung gewesen
Immer nur drum rumzureden macht es nicht mehr ungeschehen
Ja, ich bin bei Weitem nicht perfekt, bin der gleiche Scheißdreck
Wie alle andern, aber meinte es mal ernst
Wollt Familie gründen mit zweiundzwanzig Jahren
Aber nach dem ganzen Kram gab es keine Landebahn
Bin für immer angeklagt in deiner Illusion
Doch in Wahrheit bin ich auch nur einer unter Millionen
Manchmal breche ich zusammen in meiner Singlewohnung
Bis das Handy wieder klingelt, du rufst an und willst mir drohen
Auch wenn mich alle hassen, soll die Kleine weiter strahlen
Irgendwann mal werd' ich etwas Schlimmes tun in meinem Wahn

Pressão subiu, já vamo' decolar
Eu quero ver quem vai se segurar
Quando isso aqui balançar
Quando a buzina tocar

Beat no grau, pressão a mil
Equalizou, tá queimando o pavio
Aperta o cinto, que o brega vai tocar
Todo mundo vai dançar

É tentação, emoção, fritação
Bota a mão no coração, que ele vai acelerar
Eita, menina, quando toca essa batida
Todo mundo se anima e começa a rebolar

Preste atenção no poder da tentação
E da buzina quando toca fazendo sair do chão
Agora preste atenção no poder da tentação
E da buzina-zina-zina-zina-zina-zinação

Siento tener que irme así
Sin decirte adiós

Siento volverte loca

No mas besos al alba
Ni una sola caricia abra
Esto se acaba aquí

Vivir junto a mi

Por eso te digo bajito que doy lo que

Solo beso has parado mi tiempo

Pablo Alborán,"No queda mas que tu
No queda mas que yo
En este extraño salón
Sin nadie que nos diga donde como
Y cuando nos besamos
Tenía ganas ya
De pasar junto a ti
Unos minutos soñando,
Sin un reloj que cuente las
Caricias que te voy dando
Juramento de sal y limón
Prometimos querernos los dos

Te he echado de menos
Todo este tiempo
He pensado en tú sonrisa y
En tú forma de caminar
Te he echado de menos
He soñado el momento
De verte al lado mio dejándote llevar

Quiero que siga así
Tu alma pegada a mi
Mientras nos quedamos quietos
Dejando que la piel cumpla poco
A poco todos sus deseos
Hoy no hay nada que hacer
Quedémonos aquí
Contándonos secretos
Diciéndonos bajito que lo nuestro
Siempre se hará eterno
Fantasía en una copa de alcohol
Prometimos volver a vernos

Te he echado de menos
Todo este tiempo
He pensado en tú sonrisa y
En tú forma de caminar
Te he echado de menos
He soñado el momento
De verte al lado mio dejándote llevar

Silencio que mis dedos
Corren entre tus dedos
Y con un suave desliz hago
Que se pare el tiempo

Te he echado de menos
Todo este tiempo
He pensado en tú sonrisa y
En tú forma de caminar
Te he echado de menos
He soñado el momento
De verte al lado mio dejándote llevar
De verte al lado mio dejándote llevar

Yo te he echado de menos
Yo te he echado de menos",Te He Echado de Menos,2012
Pablo Alborán,"Te juro que es verte la cara 
Y mi alma se enciende 
Y sacas al sol las pestañas 
Y el mundo florece 
Dejas caer caminando un pañuelo 
Y mi mano sin mi lo recoge 
Tienes la risa más fresca 
De todas las fuentes 

Eres el timbre del nido de mis gorriones 
Hueles a hierba y me sabes a tinta y borrones 
Eres el rayo de mayo, mis letras, tus cremas 
Cantando en el coche 
Cuando juntamos las sillas me siento tan torpe 

Me tienes guardados abrazos que abarcan ciudades 
Tienes un beso de arroz y de leche en el valle 
Y dices que vienes de Marte y vas

A regresar, vamos que te irás 
Pero es que a veces, tan solo a veces 
Lo que está siendo es lo que parece 
A veces parece que te hayas marchado ya 

Mi hembra, mi dama valiente se peina 
La trenza como las sirenas 
Y rema en la arena, si quiere 

Ay mi hembra, tus labios de menta 
Te quedan mejor con los míos 
Si ruedan mejor tu sonrisa si muerde 
Ay mi hembra 

Te acuerdas de cuando empezaron los amaneceres 
Siento que la madrugada nos hizo más fuertes 
Y luego la charla tranquila entre gotas 
Las migas hicieron su parte 
Luego se juntan las sillas
Las voces se duermen 
Y siento las lagrimas 
Caen pero no tienen nombre 
Y creo que tu confusión 
Te la quito en un baile 
En eso consiste la libertad 
En no renunciar a entregarte más 
Tú a mí me gustas tal como eres 
Si a ti te pasa lo mismo y quieres 
Nos vamos pa'lante y llegamos hasta el final 

Mi hembra, mi dama valiente se peina 
La trenza como las sirenas 
Y rema en la arena, si quiere

Que no es lo mismo que quédate y ya veremos
Quédate y ya veremos

No es lo mismo estar que quedarse, ¡qué va!
Tampoco quedarse es igual que parar

Vivir es lo más peligroso que tiene la vida
Que digan por televisión que hay suelto un corazón
Que no es igual que es peligroso, que es distinto

No es lo mismo basta o bastar
Ni es lo mismo, decir, opinar, imponer o mandar
Las listas negras, las manos blancas verás
No es lo mismo
No gana el que tiene más ganas, no sé si me explico
Que hoy nadie quiere ser igual
Que más te da, no es comunismo 
Es instinto

Cien mares nos separaran a los dos
Si yo pudiera ser valiente
Sabría declararte mi amor

Que en esta canción
Derrite mi voz
Así es como yo traduzco el corazón

Me llaman loco por no ver lo poco que dicen que me das
Me llaman loco por rogarle a la luna detrás del cristal
Me llaman loco si me equivoco y te nombro sin querer
Me llaman loco por dejar tu recuerdo quemarme la piel
Loco, loco, loco, loco, loco.
Loco, loco, loco

Pero si yo pudiera darte el beso
Sabrías como duele este amor
Y podré invertir el universo
Para quedarnos en la nada tu y yo

Si acaso te vas
Sin poderte tocar
Me veo de nuevo dando de qué hablar

Me llaman loco por no ver lo poco que dicen que me das
Me llaman loco por rogarle a la luna detrás del cristal
Me llaman loco si me equivoco y te nombro sin querer
Me llaman loco por dejar tu recuerdo quemarme la piel

Que abre el mundo que yo me derrumbo si te marchas sola

Y pude ver que en los años y en seducción me vencía
Se acercó a mi observando mi cara
Y no pude evitarlo
Mis piernas y manos temblaban
Hoy la miro y en un suspiro
Despierta de nuevo el delirio en nuestra piel

Puedo ver la luz del sol en su mirada
Y sentir el calor que desprende
Cuando baila a mi alrededor
Cada noche vuelvo a perder el control

Puedo ver la luz del sol en su mirada
Y sentir el calor que desprende
Cuando baila a mi alrededor
Cada noche vuelvo a perder el control

Pero al despertar siempre desaparece
Ella cree que en mi mundo
No tiene su sitio y se arrepiente
Piensa que yo podré vivir sin sus besos
Que con sus años hay cosas
Que no pueden ser y no lo entiendo
Miro adentro y busco el recuerdo
De su cuerpo fundido en mi cuerpo y aún

Puedo ver la luz del sol en su mirada
Y sentir el calor que desprende
Cuando baila a mi alrededor
Cada noche vuelvo a perder el control

Se ha encerrado en su jaula
Y llorando se queda sola
No quiere verme para no quererme
Y ayudarme a olvidar su amor

Puedo ver la luz del sol
Puedo ver la luz del sol
Puedo ver la luz del sol en su mirada
Y sentir el calor que desprende
Cuando baila a mi alrededor
Cada noche vuelvo a perder el control

Por un amor que me dejo seco
Tarde en curar la herida que me hizo bajo mi pecho

Estaba indefenso pero llegaste tú lanzándome un beso
Agitaste los sentidos de mi cuerpo
Fundiste tus labios con la punta de todos mis dedos

Tómame de los pies a la cabeza
Porque quiero ser la lava que derrama tu volcán de miel
Bésame tápame la boca, con tu boca porque quiero arder

Ardor que fue bajando hasta el cinturón
Que tú desabrochaste sin ningún pudor
Empapaste todas las ventanas de mi desordenada habitación

Éxtasis no salgo del asombro
De tu énfasis
En hacer conmigo todo lo que un día perdí
Jamás me ha dado alguien lo que tú me has hecho sentir

Tómame de los pies a la cabeza
Porque quiero ser la lava que derrama tu volcán de miel
Bésame tápame la boca con tu boca porque quiero arder

Que cálido aliento se escapa de ti
Se pierde en mi cuello de principio a fin
Desde que me rozaste yo ya me rendí
Tú me vas a sentir

Tómame de los pies a la cabeza
Porque quiero ser la lava que derrama tu volcán de miel
Bésame tápame la boca, con tu boca porque quiero arder

Ya no siento nada
Soy tu peor enemigo 
Ya voy esquivando tus falsas palabras
Voy adivinando tus ideas 
Y tus ideas no me gustan nada 
Porque nada es lo que te queda en el alma
Me doy cuenta que nos falta el aire 
Porque agotamos toda nuestra sangre 
Quitándonos la vida sucia y lentamente

Te propongo una tregua, basta por hoy
Mientras yo voy pensando como de ti me deshago 
Sin acabar mal

Me iré tan lejos de ti donde no te pueda ver 
Ni recuerde tus armas de mujer 
Que me han hecho sentir esclavo del ayer 
Y me has quitado las ganas de seguir 
Luchando por ti

Somos dos buenos actores 
Que fingen quererse forzando el amor
Ni tú ni yo somos capaces de verlo 
Poder sentarnos y hablar de ello 
Aquí hay demasiado silencio
Ya no quiero demoras voy a explicar 
Mientras no te das cuenta 
Tengo las maletas en la puerta 
Y sin decirte adiós

Me iré tan lejos de ti donde no te pueda ver 
Ni recuerde tus armas de mujer 
Que me han hecho sentir esclavo del ayer 
Y me has quitado las ganas de seguir 
Luchando por ti

Algo ocurriría si yo te mirase 
Para decirte que mi vida ya no es vida 
Por tu afán de embaucarme sin dejarme respirar 
Por eso me iré

Ni recuerde tus armas de mujer 
Que me han hecho sentir esclavo del ayer

Que me dejó aquella obsesión

De tu corazón con mi corazón
De mis manos temblorosas arañando el colchón
Quién va a quererme soportar
Y entender mi mal humor
Si te digo la verdad no quiero verme solo

Me conformo con no verte nunca
Me conformo si ya no haces parte de mi vida
Te ha bastado una noche con otro
Para echarme la arena en los ojos

Sé que no es un juego
Pero a veces pierdo la razón
Sé lo que me hago
Y si alguien me hace daño, aguantaré

En alguien que no sepa querer

Quiero ver la luna caer
Las estrellas del revés
Aunque alguna se estrelle
Quiero cosquillas en mi piel
Quiero ver mi amanecer
Sin condiciones

Seré
Un loco enamorado más
Qué más da si yo te quiero a rabiar
Aunque después me duela más

Seré
Un loco enamorado más
Qué más da si yo te quiero a rabiar
Aunque después me duela

A toda la gente
Y su duro calendario por vivir
Harto del silencio
Del triste hotel de un barrio de Madrid
Harto de búscate en medio de tanto multitud
Qué importa quién me quiera
Si antes no me has querido tú

Quiero ver la luna caer
Las estrellas del revés
Aunque algunas se estrelle
Quiero cosquillas en mi piel
Quiero verte amanecer
Sin condiciones

Seré
Un loco enamorado más
Qué más da si yo te quiero a rabiar
Aunque después me duela más

Seré
Un loco enamorado más
Qué más da si yo te quiero a rabiar
Aunque después me duela, me duela",Seré,2012
Pablo Alborán,"Enséñame a rozarte lento
Quiero aprender a quererte, de nuevo
Susurrarte al oído, que puedo

Si quieres te dejo un minuto
Pensarte mis besos, mi cuerpo, y mi fuego
Que yo espero si tardas, porque creo que te debo, mucho

Ahora, que me he quedado solo
Veo que te debo tanto y lo siento tanto
Ahora, no aguantaré sin ti, no hay forma de seguir
Así

Vamos a jugar a escondernos
Besarnos si de pronto nos vemos
Desnudame, y ya luego veremos
Vamos a robarle el tiempo al tiempo

Por mucho que aprieto tus manos
Me cuesta creer que aun no te hayas marchado
Me fundiré en tus labios
Como se funden mis dedos en el piano

Ahora, que me he quedado solo
Veo que te debo tanto y lo siento tanto
Ahora, no aguantaré sin ti, no hay forma de seguir
Así

Tú, que me enseñaste a ser sincero
Sin temor a lo que pienso, evitando la mentira
Tú, que siempre has estado presente
Y cuando no estaba la gente que tanto me prometía

Tú, que me enseñaste a ser sincero
Sin temor a lo que pienso, evitando la mentira
Tú, que siempre has estado presente
Y cuando no estaba la gente que tanto me prometía

Pablo Alborán,"Como en un cuento infantil
La he llevado en mis sueños
Anoche la volví a sentir
Y se cumplió mi deseo

Se deshizo por mi piel
Alivió toda mi sed
Pero se volvió a marchar
Sin saber por qué

He pensado en ella toda la noche
Pero en cada poro de su piel
He dejado bien escrito mi nombre
Para que mañana se acuerde bien

He pensado en ella toda la noche
Pero en cada poro de su piel
He dejado bien escrito mi nombre
Para que mañana se acuerde bien

Puede que no vuelva más
Pero ya es parte de mí

Pablo Alborán,"Todo empezó en una noche de mayo
Cuando el alcohol hizo que rozaras mis labios
Todo surgió en mi cuarto y muy despacio
Meditando cada paso que iba dando

Después de aquello, no cruzamos palabra
Los nervios se adueñaron de la calma
Te fuiste sin apenas seguirme la mirada
Castigando mis manos, maldiciendo mi cama
Nadie lo sabía, aquella noche tú fuiste mía

Yo no sé si por ti
Rompería las olas del mar
Para escaparnos de aquí
Lejos a otro lugar
Yo no sé si podrías dejar todo atrás
O si esta noche es la última vez
Que te pueda besar

Desde entonces mi vida fue cambiando
Ya no podía arrancarte del pasado
No pude remediar enamorarme de tus manos
Aquel descuido hizo que te amara tanto
No imagino tu cuerpo entre sus brazos
Me dijiste que en tu amor no había lazos
Yo sé que yo no puedo meterme en vuestra historia
Pero mi corazón da vueltas en tu noria
Y no no lo sabía, que tú nunca fuste mía

Yo no sé si por ti
Rompería las olas del mar
Para escaparnos de aquí
Lejos a otro lugar
Yo no sé si podrías dejar todo atrás
O si esta noche es la última vez
Que te pueda besar

Cómo quieres que adivine
Que en tu alma llevas su nombre tatuado
Cómo quieres que me olvide
Si hoy malgasto mis manos
Borrando tu huella en mis labios

Cómo quieres que adivine
Que en tu alma llevas su nombre tatuado
Cómo quieres que me olvide

Pablo Alborán,"Me llevo tu media sonrisa
La que dejaste escapar
Cuando te invité a salir
Me llevo los meses de invierno
Confesando secretos
Derritiendo el amor que te di

Y di que viste en mi
Para aceptar aquella tarde
Y ahora dejarlo todo así

Y ahogándome en recuerdos
Ahogándome en tu adiós
Sonaron las sirenas
En nuestra triste habitación

El silencio te destrona
Y el vacío en mi interior
Se hace eterno y me devora
Hay un abismo entre los dos

Te llevas la triste rutina
El insulto y el asco
La angustia de verme a tu lado feliz
Y te llevas el rencor y el reproche
Los mensajes de noche
Mientras yo fingía dormir

Y di que viste en mi
Para aceptar aquella tarde
Y ahora dejarlo todo así

Y ahogándome en recuerdos
Ahogándome en tu adiós
Sonaron las sirenas
En nuestra triste habitación

El silencio te destrona
Y el vacío en mi interior
Se hace eterno y me devora
Hay un abismo entre los dos

Y pobre de mi
Supe siempre que te ibas a ir
Pero no tuve el valor
De aceptar tu traición",Ahogándome En Tu Adiós,2014
Pablo Alborán,"Qué curiosa situación
Unos aman y otros no
Nadie te explica cómo hacer
Cuando aparte de dos hay otros dos

Que dulce sensación
La de no mirar atrás
Porque lo vivido jamás será mejor
Que lo que está por llegar

Los celos son veneno
Créeme
Pero yo te quiero y tu me quieres aún más lo sé
Qué difícil es deshacernos del ayer

Es que ya ves
No hay medida en nuestra forma de querer
Me buscabas justo cuando te encontré
Piensa bien
Vaya a ser que caiga rendido a tus pies
Y no haya forma de retroceder

Te voy a morder
Me vas a morder
Para volvernos locos al amanecer

Te voy a morder
Me vas a morder
Para volvernos locos al amanecer

Qué difícil aceptar
Que el pasado vuelva a llamar
Qué difícil mirar al futuro
Cuando aún hay heridas que cerrar
Y mi pena con tu pena
Restará

Pero nos queremos como nadie se ha querido jamás
Mira qué suerte que nos hayamos encontrado al final

No hay medida en nuestra forma de querer
Me buscabas justo cuando te encontré
Piensa bien
Vaya a ser que caiga rendido a tus pies

Es quererse bien

No hay manera de que esto vaya bien

Dejando el reproche para el amanecer

Hazme sentir que lo bueno está por llegar
Que esto también pasará
Hazme sentir que compartimos un mismo latir
Haz que me acuerde de ti
Como el mejor despertar
Que he podido vivir

Harto de los ecos
De un pasado que aparece cada vez
Y los miedos que tengo me arañan por dentro
Y tú no ayudas a encontrar el porqué
Del silencio, la derrota y de la rabia
Que en la boca que te dejé
Y ahora intenta decir que me amas
Sin miedo a que parezca mentira otra vez

Y no lo ves
Digo yo que algo tendremos que hacer
Borra de golpe
Su nombre en mi nombre
Y así lo olvidaré
Y mira bien
Mientras yo te reproche de más
Y tu te escondas con la duda otra vez
No quiero mas pulsos
Hay tanto que perder

Hazme sentir que lo bueno está por llegar
Que esto también pasará
Hazme sentir que compartimos un mismo latir
Haz que me acuerde de ti

Pablo Alborán,"La conoció en la escalera
De un bar de carretera
Andaba sola y perdida
Con ganas de hablar con cualquiera
Era de noche y a oscuras
Rozó su tímida cintura
Sintieron todas las ganas de perder
La cabeza en la luna

Loca
Deja que te coma la boca
Deja que pasen hoy las horas
Perdiéndote en su risa floja
De tanto amor que se derrocha
Sus manos y su lengua rota
Tan frágiles se le deshoja
Se deshicieron de las sombras

Dale todo lo que tengas
Dentro de tu corazón tan triste
Quiere ser tu luz del día
Y tu descontrol en la noche mas fría

Y te diría mi amor quédate conmigo

La noche que se quisieron
Duró hasta que pudieron
Se arrancaron la piel
Perdiendo el norte en sus besos

Bajo de la escalera
Esa que fue testigo
De un túpido cuento
De sexo, calor y delirio

Loca
Deja que te coma la boca
Deja que pasen hoy las horas
Perdiéndote en su risa floja
De tanto amor que se derrocha
Sus manos y su lengua rota
Tan frágiles se le deshoja
Se deshicieron de las sombras

Dale todo lo que tengas
Dentro de tu corazón tan triste
Quiere ser tu luz del día
Y tu descontrol en la noche mas fría
Y te diría mi amor quédate conmigo

Tan misterioso como era
El paradero de su cartera
No te bastó su ser
Ni sus caricias más sinceras
No te bastó con ser
Por una noche su princesa

Dale todo lo que tengas
Dentro de tu corazón tan triste
Quiere ser tu luz del día
Y tu descontrol en la noche mas fría
Y te diría mi amor quédate conmigo",La Escalera,2014

Si lo que llega es aún mejor
No vivas del recuerdo amor
Nos queda mucho por vivir
Hay tantas cosas que decir
Y quieras o no quieras hoy
Voy brindar por lo que fui
Por el presente y lo que queda por hacer
Aprenderé a decir que si cuando siempre dije no
Está permitido equivocarnos

Y hoy me he levantado pensando en tus abrazos
Buscando una sonrisa que me nuble los fracasos
Que nadie nos reproche que no lo hemos intentado
Que caiga ya la lluvia y deje el asfalto mojado
Hoy me he levantado cantándole a los vientos
Que el mundo gira en torno a lo que decidamos todos
Y todos encontramos un motivo para ser
Al menos esta noche mejor
De lo que fuimos ayer

No queda nada que perder
Aunque nos cueste igual que ayer
Sonríe una y otra vez
El tiempo solo borrará lo que no pesa de verdad
Que nuestras ganas de vivir sean un volcán

Por el presente y lo que queda por hacer

De saber quién me quiere y no me quiere
De saber que existe un lugar donde puedo volver

Quien diga que los sueños no se cumplen
Que me explique como vivo en esta nube

Sí, quizás me viste sonreír
Cuando mas quería huir
Pero lloré de la emoción cuando cantabas junto a mí
Vine para hacerte ver
Que desde el alma hasta el papel
Confieso que mi vida he dado siempre y siempre la daré

Tengo la suerte
De no saber competir con la gente
De saber que si hoy me equivoco
Tengo que alguien que puede entenderme

Tengo la suerte
De ser ciudadano del aire
De sentir que soy libre sin ser
Un vagabundo en la tierra de nadie

Fue imposible evitar las prisas
Y aún así me entregabais con risas

Sigamos juntos cantando
Con el alma y guitarra en mano
Con el cuerpo y los ojos de ambos brillando

Bésame, no dudes ni un segundo de mi alma
Alteras mis sentidos liberas mis alas

No cabe tanto amor en esta cama si me dejaras
Que bueno es sentir que suspiro de nuevo
Que tu roce y mi roce juntos forman fuego

Y contar

Que daba la hoguera

Ahora es más fácil respirar

Pablo Alborán,"Dicen que la vida se decide en un tablero de ajedrez
Que los sueños son engaños que al final desaparecen
Dicen tantas cosas que podrían no decirlas
Y callarse de una vez

Que el amor es sólo un juego
Y una estúpida ilusión

Y el estúpido resulta ser aquel
Que no ama a nadie de corazón

Pedazos de un pasado marchito
Vive sin barreras, así que

Déjate de historias
Y ven, acércate, que te cuente
Lo que vamos a hacer

Saca de tu pecho el rencor
Y mira bien hacia dónde se dirigen tus pies
Enséñame tus alas y grita
Que la vida es bonita
Aunque esté del revés

Vívela, vívela, vívela

Dicen que la suerte es caprichosa
Y nos dispone el porvenir
Y que venga como venga
La tenemos que asumir

Dicen que tenemos un reloj que determina
Lo que nos va a ocurrir
Dicen que el destino manda siempre
Por encima del querer
Y yo te digo que el querer
Acaba siendo poder

Y el poder cambiarlo todo
Está en las manos del que quiera
Hacerlo bien

Así que intenta, camina
Dibuja e inventa el camino
Perdimos tiempo en rebuscar
Pedazos de un pasado marchito
Vive sin barreras, así que

Déjate de historias

Ahogando las prisas en besos callados
Pero nos alimentamos bien
De sueños y proyectos por hacer
Construimos un amanecer
Aunque a veces nos costo creer

Te volvería a llamar
Y volvería a empezar
Y lo haría con menos reproches y más verdades quizás
Te volvería besar
Pero tocándote más
Volvería sin frenos
Ni tantos reflejos de una vida fugaz

Gracias por ser
Quien lleva las riendas
Cuando quema la sed de ser quien yo quiera
Por mirarme como nadie me miro
Por hacer de la tristeza una opción
Y llenarme de tanta verdad
Cuando el mundo no hace más que divagar

Le di vueltas y vueltas por miedo al fracaso
Pero he visto que en ti tengo escritos mis años
Y a pesar de verlo todo a la mitad
Y de amarnos a media velocidad
Puede que las cosas salgan bien
Aunque el miedo nos quiera vencer

Te volvería a llamar
Y volvería a empezar
Y lo haría con menos reproches y más verdades quizás
Te volvería besar
Pero tocándote más
Volvería sin frenos
Ni tantos reflejos de una vida fugaz

No me dejes escapar
Que el amor que hay en mi no se va
Pero asusta quererte como te quiero a rabiar
Estaba escrito que fuéramos dos
Pero es que a veces te miro y me extraño
De ver que podemos vivir como planeamos

Il offre un arc-en-ciel",Sous le ciel de Paris,2015
Pablo Alborán,"Trozos de papel, se pierden en la mar
Vientos que les lleva rumbo al azar
Qué blanco es el ayer
Qué triste el porvenir
Lleno de preguntas que no llegan a su fin

Quién dirige el aire
Quién rompe las hojas
De aquellas palmeras que lloran

Quién maneja el tiempo
Que pierden a solas
Quién teje la redes que les ahogan

Navegaré el dolor
Un barco sin timón
Llevando los recuerdos de la vida que dejó
El cielo verde y gris
La nieve de marfil
Caen sobre el sueño
Que una vez pudo vivir

Pero quién dirige al aire
Quién rompe las hojas
De aquellas palmeras que lloran

Quién maneja el tiempo
Que pierden a solas
Quién teje las redes que les ahogan",Palmeras En la Nieve,2015
Pablo Alborán,"No hay ni un corazón que valga la pena 
Ni uno solo que no venga herido de guerra 
Y sigo aquí 
Cuanto silencio hay 
Cuanto silencio no se
El tiempo agotado en compases de espera 
Dibuja un desierto por dentro y por fuera 
Que tira pa atrás a quien logre acercarse hasta aquí 
No quiero pasados cargados de impuestos 
Ni busco imposibles en cielos abiertos 
Pero algo que valga la paz por la que hay 
Que apostar 

Amor inmenso y sin herida 
Sin historia y a medida 
Amor que no haga mas preguntas 
Preparado a no entender 
Amor que mire bien de frente 
Suficientemente fuerte 
Amor que no busque salida 
Y no me cueste la vida 
(Por que pa lograr vivir) 

No hay ni un corazón que valga la pena 
No hay un puto corazón en toda esta tierra
Olvídate
(No hay un solo corazón) 
No hay un corazón que no vaya de pena 
No hay un puto corazón sin cargo de problemas
Que de descanso y no haga preguntas
Olvídate 
Quisiera volar hasta donde te escondes 
Contarte de una vez que razones me rompen 
Dejar de echar tanto de menos a tu corazón 
Y quisiera tenerlo, robarlo aunque fuera 
Dejar de negar que aun me vale la pena 
Aquel corazón que me late, tan dentro de ti

Amor inmenso y sin herida 
Sin historia y a medida 
Amor que no haga mas preguntas

Pablo Alborán,"Todas nuestras tardes son 
Bajo estrellas escondidas 
Luces que mi corazón 
Se pensará 

Desnudarme como soy 
Siendo así­ como la arena 
Que resbala en tu querer 
Por donde fuera 

Darte para retenerte 
Recelar si no me miras 
Con tus ojos, tu boca
Tu sabia que es mía, mía

Responde a mi nombre si te lo susurran 
Arranca de todo mi piel que es tan tuya 
Que arda mi cuerpo si no estás conmigo amor

Olvídame tú
Que yo no puedo 
No voy a entender el amor 
Sin ti

Olvídame tú
Que yo no puedo 
Dejar de quererte 
Por mucho que lo intente 
No puedo

Qué bonito cuando el sol 
Derramó sobre nosotros 
Esa luz que se apagó
Y que se perdía

Si tú quieres quiero yo 
Palpitar de otra manera 
Que nos lleve sin timón 
Lo que nos queda

Sentiremos tal vez frío 
Si no existe poesí­a 
En tus ojos, tu boca 
Tu sabia que es mía, mía

Y el tiempo nos pasa casi inardvertido 
Golpea con fuerza lo tuyo y lo mío 
Que pena ignorarlo y dejarlo perdido, amor

Para cambiarme de pronto la vida

Pablo Alborán,"A veces sueña con tu alegría, mi melodía
A veces sueño del aire que nos caemos
Que es lo que iba a decirte amor
A veces sueña com tu alegría, mi melodía
En esas noches que escribo sólo pretextos
Lo que quiero decirte amor
Es que he sido tan feliz contigo

Yo quiero el aire que tiene tu alma
Yo quiero el aire que, que vive en ti
Yo quiero el aire, aire que derramas
Aire pa' quererte, aire pa' vivir
Yo quiero el aire que tiene tu alma
Yo quiero el aire que, que vive en ti
Yo quiero el aire, aire que derramas

Porque no tiene cura la locura de tus labios
Ya nada en esta vida me parece raro
El alma roza despacito el mundo en nuestra piel

De mi vida, caminar
Y de tu vida niña lo que no se ve
Y le he robado el alma al aire
Para dártela en este suspiro

Y no tiene remedio para el que componga
Si alguna vez te encuentro por mi cobardía
Te pienso dar de una
Todos aquellos besos que te merecías

Por el puente de la esperanza
Buscaba un rinconcito para la risa
Pensando que ha valido la pena amarte
Pasamos momentitos tan flamenquitos
Y vimos rinconcitos pa' enamorarse

Yo paso y tú decides cuándo asomarte

Bajo la lluvia van las cosas
La gente, los problemas van y vienen
Bajo la lluvia va
La gente y las historias
Los momentos
Van buscando los motivos, la casualidad

En medio de la lluvia va
Ella camina en los espejos harta de volar
Yo sigo aquí entre sábanas y música
¿Dónde estarás?

Que llueve
Tu pelo se te moja y duele
No importa tanto pero hoy llueve
Llueve

La lluvia, niña, envuelve todo, no te pongas triste
También a esa mujer que una vez perdí

Y los diluvios de recuerdos nunca tienen fin

No importa tanto pero hoy llueve
Bajo la lluvia van y vienen
No importa tanto pero hoy llueve
Me duele tanto que tu pelo se to moje tanto
No importa tanto pero hoy llueve

Pablo Alborán,"Era tan chico
perdía el norte y el sur 
Le gustaba los sueños prohibidos 
Encontrarte de frente en el bus

Era tan pillo 
con su salero andaluz 
Si su madre decía las diez de la noche 
Llegaba a la parque la luz

Sin previo aviso podía llevarte con él
al paraíso, llegabais los dos sin mirar
sin pedir permiso, contigo aprendió a tocar y a besar
Hay amores que ganan al tiempo 
No importa la facha, el dinero, la edad 
Porque tú eras su otra mitad

Era testigo 
de aquel instinto animal 
Si le mordías debajo de sabanas frías 
Cuando todos se iban al bar

Era tu amigo 
amante y loco por ti 
Desde entonces no ha habido otra historia 
Que mereciera la pena vivir

Sin previo aviso podía llevarte con él

Pero callé tu boca con mis besos
Y así pasaron muchas, muchas horas

Cuando llegó la noche
Apareció la luna
Y entró por la ventana
Qué cosa más bonita
Cuando la luz del cielo
Iluminó tu cara

Que el hambre que tienes se olvida 
De las mordidas que ya le dio a mi vida

Es cierto, no hago más que dar rodeos
Lo nuestro ha sido un viaje de ida y vuelta
Hagamos el amor en el vagón, que nos detengan

Me vuelvo idiota

De mis montañas de arena
De acantilados y de mis días pesados
Mis naufragios ya no valen la pena

De los poetas de palabra hueca
Del ruido que ahogue tu canción favorita de amor

Un pausa en medio de todo el desorden
Quiero un combate de besos sin amarres
Quiero un lienzo para hacer de colores tus lunares

Por haber sabido amarnos, ilesos del desastre
Cuando no ha sabido nadie

Pablo Alborán,"Vuelves, en cada sueño que tengo caigo de nuevo en tu red
Sé que tarda un tiempo curarme de ti de una vez
Tuve tantos momentos felices, que olvido lo triste que fue 
Darte de mi alma, lo que tú echaste a perder

Yo no quería amarte, tú me enseñaste a odiarte
Todos los besos que me imaginé vuelven al lugar donde los vi crecer
En Saturno viven los hijos que nunca tuvimos
En Plutón aún se oyen gritos de amor
En la Luna gritan a solas tu voz y mi voz
Pidiendo perdón, cosa que nunca pudimos hacer peor

Tienes la misma culpa que tengo
Aunque te cueste admitir, que sientes como siento 
La almohada no suele mentir

Y yo no quería amarte, tú me enseñaste a odiarte
Todos los besos que me imaginé, vuelven al lugar donde los vi crecer
En Saturno viven los hijos que nunca tuvimos

Pablo Alborán,"Ella se desliza y me atropella 
Y, aunque a veces no me importe
Sé que el día que la pierda volveré a sufrir 
Por ella, que aparece y que se esconde
Que se marcha y que se queda
Que es pregunta y es respuesta 
Que es mi oscuridad, estrella

Ella me peina el alma y me la enreda 
Va conmigo pero no sé dónde va 
Mi rival, mi compañera, que está tan dentro de mi vida 
Y, a la vez, está tan fuera
Sé que volveré a perderme 
Y la encontraré de nuevo 
Pero con otro rostro y otro nombre diferente y otro cuerpo 
Pero sigue siendo ella, que otra vez me lleva
Nunca me responde si al girar la rueda

Ella se hace fría y se hace eterna 
Un suspiro en la tormenta
A la que tantas veces le cambió la voz 
Gente que va y que viene y siempre es ella 
Que me miente y me lo niega
Que me olvida y me recuerda 
Pero, si mi boca se equivoca 
Pero, si mi boca se equivoca 
Y al llamarla nombro a otra 
A veces siente compasión por este loco, ciego y loco corazón 

Sea lo que quiera dios que sea 
Mi delito es la torpeza de ignorar 
Que hay quien no tiene corazón 
Y va quemando, va quemándome y me quema, no no

Y, ¿ si fuera ella? 
No, no, oh no

A veces siente compasión por este loco, ciego y loco corazón 

¿Era? ¿quién me dice si era ella? 
Y, si la vida es una rueda y va girando 
Y nadie sabe cuándo tiene que saltar y la miro 
Y, ¿si fuera ella? Y, ¿si fuera ella?","Y, ¿Si Fuera Ella?",2017
Pablo Antonio y La Firma,"Que milagro tiene que pasar para que me ames
Que estrella del cielo a de caer para poderte convencer

Quiero escarparme de este eterno anochecer

Dice mucha gente que los hombres nunca lloran

Porque te sigo amando y dejaste sangrando mis heridas
No puedo colmarte ni de joyas ni dinero
Pero puedo darte un corazón que es verdadero 
Mis alas en el viento necesitan de tus besos

Y sabes que eres la princesa de mis sueños encantados 
Cuantas guerras he librado por tenerte aquí a mi lado 
No me canso de buscarte, no me importara arriesgarte

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast

I tell you I mean it

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Nothing much

A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Pablo Carbonell,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,2006

Pablo Cárcamo,"Volver a los diecisiete
Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a los 17,1994

Love can just walk away?
Just when you think it's found you,
It hasn't got a thing to say
And so you feel that no one really cares
And you conceal that your heart
Was never there

Oh, How
Many tears 
Will it take 
'Til you hear?
Oh, How 
Many lies 
Win the race 
Get the prize?

You say you'll beat the masters
Playing at their own game
But you've got to look for the answers
And learn to accept the blame
There is a time when all of us are scared
But don't buy the lines 'cause the price

Is so unfair

Oh, How 
Many tears 
Will it take 
'Til you hear?
Oh, How 
Many lies 
Win the race 
And get the prize?

Come to me
I'll be here
With the love
To dry your tears

There is a time when all of us are scared
But you'll lose your mind if you just
Let fear keep you there

Can anybody tell me'
How 
Many tears 
Will it take 
'Til you hear? (I wanna know)
How 
Many lies  (How many lies)

Pablo Cruise,"Yeah, you say you need me,
But it's not like before
Love drags its feet
As it slams the door
Night finds its reasons
For falling into bed
It teases crazy fools
who beg to be misled

Well, what about you
Starving for affection all of the time?
And what about me
Feeding you the love I wish was mine?

When love is at your door
Open up and let it in
When love comes back for more
Open up again and let it win

Understanding what we need
Is driving us insane
But ain't love worth the lessons
We learn from the pain
Selfish dispositions'
Are playin' us both for fools
No one ever wins
Fighting cool with cool
Well, think about me
I have waded through your craziness
I think about you
Jumping in to save me with no regrets

When love is at your door
Open up and let it in
When love comes back for more
Open up again and let it win

Are you lonely?
Could you go for more
Of the loving
That we had before?
Hang up the telephone
Cause I'm coming home
Its worth a try
To find out if we're right",When Love Is at Your Door,1979

You thought that your love was strong
Now you're feelin' like such a fool
Poor you, you're thinkin' maybe if you said goodbye
You'll understand the reason why
The love you had felt so cool um hm

Oh but it's all right
Once you get past the pain
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open
Cause love will find a way

Sometimes we all feel a need to change
Our love we have to rearrange
And move on to something new yes you do
Your dreams feel like they're fallin' apart
You need to find a brand new start
But you're almost afraid to be true to yourself

Oh, but it's all right
Once you get past the pain
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open
Cause love will find a way

Love will find a way
Love will find a way

So now don't, don't be afraid of yourself
Just move on to something else
And let your love shine through
Again yes 'cause it's all right
Once you get past the pain
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open

Got me in the mood I cant get free, no

Que tus manos son mi bandera
Y que tengo de frontera una canción

Una canción
Una canción",Tu Enemigo,2016
Pablo López,"Inmensas tempestades, tu mano y la mía
Tienes algo no sé que es
Hay tanto de melódico en tu fantasía
Y un toque de misterio, mi límite
Conservo algún recuerdo que no debería
Lo sé, ¿qué puedo hacer?
A todos nos ocurre la monotonía
Nos gana la batalla alguna vez
Alguna vez, alguna vez, alguna vez

Por eso, vida mía, por el día a día
Por enseñarme a ver el cielo más azul
Por ser mi compañera y darme tu energía
No cabe en una vida mi gratitud
Por aguantar mis malos ratos y manías
Por conservar secretos que me guardas tu
Quiero ser por una vez capaz de ganar y de perder

Perdona si me ves perder la compostura
En serio, te lo agradezco que hayas sido mía
Si ves que mi canción acaso no resulta
Avísame y recojo la melancolía melancolía

Te dejaré una ilusión
Envuelta en una promesa de eterna pasión
Una esperanza pintada en un mar de cartón
Un mundo nuevo que sigue, donde un día lo pusiste
Tú eres esa mujer
Por quien me siento ese hombre capaz de querer
Vivo cada segundo la primera vez
Sabiendo que me quisiste
Y todo aquello que me diste

Tu conserva mi recuerdo de piratería
Derrama los secretos abre aquel baúl
Sigamos siendo cómplices en compañía
De aquello que me diste bajo el cielo azul
Por aguantar mis malos ratos y manías
Por conservar secretos que me guardas tú
Quiero ser por una vez capaz de ganar y de perder

Perdón si alguna vez guardé la compostura
No sabes lo que ha sido que hayas sido mía
Comprendo que agotaste toda tu dulzura
Pero no me pidas, niña la melancolía, melancolía

Te dejaré una ilusión
Envuelta en una promesa de eterna pasión
Una esperanza pintada en un mar de cartón
Un mundo nuevo que sigue, donde un día lo pusiste
Tú eres esa mujer
Por quien me siento ese hombre capaz de querer
Vivo cada segundo la primera vez

Pablo López,"He llegado hasta aquí porque nunca dejé de buscarte 
He aprendido a vivir el camino y no quiero volver 
Y tampoco quiero que me duelan los finales, las miserias 
Los idiotas enfadados, los abrazos de cartón 

De lejos te vi 
De lejos me has hecho feliz 
Y no quiero dejar de buscarte por este camino 
Te he contado que no te conozco y te quiero de lejos 

Y te juro que vale la pena caer y romperse la cara
Que regalo tan grande aprender de lo que nos dolió 
Que regalo estar en este viaje de románticos salvajes
Soñadores desterrados caminantes del amor 

De lejos te vi, de lejos me has hecho feliz 
Y no quiero dejar de buscarte por este camino 
Te he contado que no te conozco y te quiero de lejos, de lejos 

Ohh, no oh oh

Yo no quiero dejar de buscarte por este camino 
Te he contado que no te conozco y te quiero de lejos, de lejos

De tu cobardía

Camina despacio

De extraña mirada
De salto elegante
Pequeño vestigio de fiera salvaje

Por eso dejalo

No precisa mi amor

Te robo los días
Te ensucio las manos
Me escondo y me pierdo

No quiere septiembres
Que engañen al mundo
No ahonda ciudades

Sobre las cenizas
De la discreción

Ruido calla a la sonrisa

Y, aunque a veces no me importe
Sé que el día que la pierda volveré a sufrir

Que es mi oscuridad, estrella

Que un ser pequeño te dió al partir
Quién por tu árbol, por todo eso

Por amor estamos haciendo 
Por amor se está hasta matando

¡Cuba va, Cuba va! 

Quiero abrir mi voz al mundo 
Que llegue al último confín 
De norte a sur why de este a oeste 
Why que cualquier hombre pueda 
Gritar sus propias esperanzas, 
Sus heridas, why su lucha 
Cuando diga 
¡Cuba va! 

Puede que algún machete 
Se enrede en la maleza, 
Puede que algunas noches 
Las estrellas no quieran salir. 
Puede que con los brazos 
Haya que abrir la selva 
Pero a pesar los pesares, como sea 
Cuba va, ¡Cuba va!

Donde pudieras moverte como un muro

Te das cuenta que no hay nada que amar 
Y que es terrible ese tener que dar 
Y que esperar de una fruta bien podrida

Como un libertador en chacabuco
Los andes que miraron crecerte

Partías el aire, saltaban las piedras
Surgías perfecto de allí

Devino en tan fuerte adalid
Cesó por un momento la existencia

La vida que es tan corta al parecer 
Cuando se han hecho cosas sin querer

Cada paso se dá porque se sienta
Al hacer un recuento ya nos vamos 
Y la vida pasó sin darnos cuenta

como tantas es amargo tu sabor.
Ay, amor del jardín yerba buena
como espina puede ser el desamor.
Cuando llamas estoy,
a la hora que tú digas voy.

porque dándome disgustos
o queriéndome mucho
siempre vuelvo a ti.

lleno de contradicciones
presto a soluciones
siempre creo en ti.

Porque me inhibe.

Que ya se han abarrotado,
Usted mira a todos lados,
Y lo ve lleno de gente,
No es que tanto me moleste,
Pero pocos son de allí,
Se fueron de allá, de aquí,
Y hoy arrastran esa pena,
De sentirse entre cadenas,
Que es lo que me pasa a mí.

El que nació en el caribe,
Goza de una facultad,
Al sentir su libertad,
Se identifica y la vive,
Al cambiar la que lo inhibe,
Por su mar, por su palmera,
Una eterna primavera,
O un sol que entra en su piel,
Va sintiendo que no es él
Y pierde hasta su bandera.",Amo Esta Isla,1995
Pablo Milanés,"Mírame bien, no creo ser el hombre
Que a cualquier dama asombre
Y es que mi mejor tiempo pasó
Te miro bien, provocas que me asombre
Gustas a cualquier hombre, tu vida comenzó

Cuando camino junto a ti llevo una prisa
Que mueve a risa y mueve a trágico dolor
No quiero más que siga esta mentira
Tú naciendo a la vida, y a mí que se me va

Qué quieres tú? tener una experiencia
Porque tu muchacho no piensa y sales a buscar
Algo más que no sea esa gran savia vital
Que entorpece la idea, y que no te deja soñar

Qué quiero yo? Demostrar que no es cierto
Que todo tuvo su momento, que siempre hay que llenar
Cada fase que llega, pues después se va a buscar
Y el ocaso te ciega, y él no suele perdonar

No busques más, no fuerces tu destino
Un día en el camino tu verdadero amor hallarás
Yo volveré a esa paz deseada
Aunque no quiera nada, y allí, recordaré

",Mirame Bien,1995
Pablo Milanés,"Todavía quedan restos de humedad
Sus olores llenan ya mi soledad
En la cama su silueta 
Se dibuja cual promesa 
De llenar el breve espacio 
En que no está

Todavía yo no sé si volverá
Nadie sabe, al día siguiente, lo que hará
Rompe todos mis esquemas
No confiesa ni una pena
No me pide nada a cambio de lo que da

Suele ser violenta y tierna
No habla de uniones eternas
Mas se entrega cual si hubiera 
Sólo un día para amar
No comparte una reunión
Mas le gusta la canción 
Que comprometa su pensar

Todavía no pregunte «¿te quedarás?»
Temo mucho a la respuesta de un «jamás»
La prefiero compartida 
Antes que vaciar mi vida
No es perfecta, mas se acerca 
A lo que yo simplemente soñé

Suele ser violenta y tierna
No habla de uniones eternas
Mas se entrega cual si hubiera 
Sólo un día para amar
No comparte una reunión
Mas le gusta la canción 
Que comprometa su pensar",El Breve Espacio en Que No Estás,1995
Pablo Milanés,"A veces cuando el sol levanta el vuelo 
remuevo la esperanza y miro adentro 
y entre mi corazón y la añoranza 
sólo dormita un charco de aguacero

Detrás de la mirada salta un sueño 
que sin querer se agita en la garganta 
una carrera ciega hasta tu cuello 
un tropiezo que rompe la balanza

No habrá razón que guarda el equilibrio 
cuando la ausencia llora en los sentidos 
cuando la soledad es un gran pino 
que crece en un jardín de blancos lirios

No habrá más que gritar contra el silencio 
cuando me invade el pecho la llovizna 
y aunque tu luz no fuera ya la misma 
y me quede de pie donde aún te espero

A veces cuando el mar nos alcanza 
y tan sólo el rocío moja el suelo 
un pájaro veloz recorre el cielo 
y crece con el tiempo la distancia
y crece, con el tiempo la distancia

No habrá razón que guarde el equilibrio

y aunque tu luz no fuera ya la misma 
y me quede de pie donde aún te espero

Remuevo la esperanza y miro adentro 
cuando la pena oprime la garganta 
detrás de la mirada salta un sueño 
y aunque llueva en la calle el viento canta

A veces cuando el mar nos alcanza

un pájaro veloz recorre el cielo 
y crece con el tiempo la distancia
y crece, con el tiempo la distancia

que la bondad te defina 
por siempre, la felicidad 
conserve en ti esa sonrisa",A Veces Cuando el Sol,1995
Pablo Milanés,"La soledad
Es un pájaro grande multicolor
Que ya no tiene alas para volar
Y cada nuevo intento da más
Dolor.

La soledad
Anida en la garganta para esperar
El grito que se arranca con su
Cantar cuando llega el silencio
Del desamor.

La soledad
A veces tiene ganas de acompañar
El rostro que recuerda mal
Aquel amor que nunca fue para
Soñar.

La soledad
Inventa la más bella aparición
Remueve los rincones del corazón
Para quedarse sola la soledad...
Con su niñez
Su mocedad
Con su vejez
Para llorar
Para morir
En soledad...",La Soledad,1995
Pablo Milanés,"Si ella me faltara alguna vez nadie me podría acompañar
Nadie ocuparía ese lugar que descubro en cada amanecer
Si me faltara alguna vez

Si ella me dejara de querer cuando la contemplo al despertar
Siento la pureza que me da, nunca la pureza que me da
Nunca la podré corresponder si me dejara de querer

Si ella se olvidara de cantar ese hermoso mundo que me da
Cómo volvería a predicar si fue su palabra mi verdad
Si se olvidara de cantar

Si ella no inundara esta ciudad todo cambiaría de color
Gozaría de otra claridad
Cuando miro y pienso con dolor si no inundara esta ciudad

Si ella me faltara alguna vez
Si ella me dejara de querer
Si ella se olvidara de cantar
Si ella no inundara esta ciudad
Yo no escribiría esta canción

",Si Ella Me Faltara Alguna Vez,1995
Pablo Milanés,"La felicidad 
Te he visto pasando del brazo de un hombre
Que con su mirada te envuelve en amor
Te he visto sonriendo mostrando tus ojos
Sin sombras, sin dudas, sin guardar rencor
Al tiempo en que al slo pronunciar mi nombre
Con cierta ternura te ahogaba en dolor

Me vi caminando guardando distancias
Que slo mostraba la complicidad
De besos furtivos, de manos con ansias
De darte un abrazo y gritar mi verdad
De grandes olvidos, de encuentros
De instantes, de amores
Y un poco tu infelicidad

Qu dulces mentiras, qu grandes verdades
Qu nos inventamos para perdurar
Qu filosofa, qu honor, qu irona
Que nadie se hiera, que todos se cuiden
Si slo mi cuerpo se va a desgarrar

Te he visto pasando del brazo de un hombre

Con cierta ternura me ahoga en dolor",La Felicidad,1995
Pablo Milanés,"Lo que sentí, fue como un rayo en mi interior
Que me sorprende el corazón
Todo se rompe, todo estalla
Y algo acaba de morir

Para sentir otra manera de ser feliz
Otra de manera de sufrir
Otra manera de vivir
Lo que hasta ayer era reír

Qué pasara, adónde irán mis juegos a parar
Y mi inocencia a terminar
Qué nuevo amor será
Qué tal si me querrá

Qué voy a hacer si dice no
Ya yo no mando al corazón
Qué confusión, qué dicha, qué dolor

Siento al mirar que todo acaba de cambiar
Y veo las cosas para amar
Adiós infancia, ojalá que te recuerde
En mi vejez, con amor

",El Primer Amor,1996
Pablo Milanés,"No quiero que te vayas, la noche está muy fría
Abrígame en tu pecho, hasta que llegue el día

La almohada está impaciente de acariciar tu cara
Tal vez te de un consejo, tal vez no diga nada

Mañana, muy temprano, platicarás conmigo
Y si estás decidida de abandonar mi nido

Entonces será en vano, tratar de detenerme
Regálame esta noche, retrásame la muerte

Mañana, muy temprano

",Regalame Esta Noche,1996
Pablo Milanés,"Ya se va aquella edad
Qué lindo fue, que despertar
fue sentir la inmensa sensación 
de vivir en algo más 
que en sueños ir

Fue crecer, saber, dudar
hacer, buscar, pedir, brindar
recorrer el último camino 
que te lleva hacia tu propia identidad

Ya se va aquella edad, 
que al elegir te encontrarás 
si soñar, frente a tu propia imagen 
ya en un viaje del que jamás regresarás 

Y hoy se resiente el corazón 
siento algo más que una ilusión

Ya se va aquella edad 
es algo nuevo que va entrando 
se va imponiendo, lacerando 
algún rincón de mi emoción

Y aquí esta pues esa edad
que al elegir te encontrarás 
si soñar, frente a tu propia imagen 
ya en un viaje del que jamás regresarás
Jamás",Ya Se Va Aquella Edad,1996
Pablo Milanés,"No te pido que te cuides
Esa delgadez extrema
Sólo pido que me mires
Con esa mirada buena

Tus ojos no son luceros
Que alumbran la madrugada
Pero si me miran siento
Que me tocas con tus manos

Tus manos no son hermosas
No veo estilo en tus dedos
Pero qué humanos reposan
Si se enroscan en tu pelo

Tu pelo ya sin color
Sin ese brillo supremo
Cuida y resguarda con celo
Lo que cubre con amor

Tu cerebro porque piensas
Porque es tu clave y motor
Va generando la fuerza
Que me hace humano y mejor

Cuerpo, manos, ojos, pelo
Carne y hueso inanimados
Que cobran vida
Y por eso quiero vivir a tu lado

",Amor,1996
Pablo Milanés,"El tiempo pasa

Se impone siempre un pedazo
De razÃ³n

Vamos viviendo
Viendo las horas
Que van pasando
Las viejas discusiones
Se van perdiendo
Entre las razones
Porque aÃ±os atrÃ¡s
Tomar tÃº mano
Robarte un beso
Sin forzar el momento
HacÃ­a parte de una verdad

Porque el tiempo pasa

Pablo Milanés,"Muchas veces te dije que antes de hacerlo
había que pensarlo muy bien,
Que a esta unión de nosotros
le hacia falta carne y deseo también,

Que no bastaba que me entendieras
y que murieras por mí,
Que no bastaba que en mi fracaso
yo me refugiara en ti,

Y ahora ya ves lo que pasó
al fin nació, al pasar de los años,
el tremendo cansancio que provoco ya en ti,
Y aunque es penoso lo tienes que decir.

Por mi parte esperaba
que un día el tiempo se hiciera cargo del fin,
si así no hubiera sido
yo habría seguido jugando a hacerte feliz,

Y aunque el llanto es amargo piensa en los años
que tienes para vivir,
que mi dolor no es menos y lo peor
es que ya no puedo sentir,

Y ahora tratar de conquistar
con vano afán ese tiempo perdido
que nos deja vencidos sin poder conocer
eso que llaman amor para vivir.
Para vivir",Para Vivir,1996
Pablo Milanés,"Aunque soy un pobre diablo
casi siempre digo la verdad
como fuego abrasador
siempre quise ser el que no soy
no transcurre el tiempo junto a ti
no existe el reloj
no tiene sentido entre tú y yo.

Aunque soy un pobre diablo
se despierta el día y echo a andar
invencible de moral
que difícil es buscar la paz
convivir venciendo a los demás
nuestra sociedad
es un gran proyecto para el mal.

Dejo sangre en el papel
y todo lo que escribo al día siguiente rompería
si no fuera porque creo en ti
a pesar de todo tú me haces vivir
me haces escribir dejando el rastro de mi alma
y cada verso es un girón de piel
soy un corazón tendido al sol.

Aunque soy un pobre diablo
sé dos o tres cosas nada más
sé con quién no debo andar
también se guardar fidelidad
sé quien son amigos de verdad
sé bien donde están
nunca piden nada y siempre dan

si no es para perecer
porque otros puedan tener
lo que uno disfruta why ama.
La vida no vale nada
si yo me quedo sentado
después que he visto why soñado

La vida no vale nada
cuando otros se están matando
why yo sigo aqui cantando
cual si no pasara nada.
La vida no vale nada
si escucho un grito mortal
why no es capaz de tocar
mi corazón que se apaga.
La vida no vale nada
si ignoro que el asesino
cogió por otro camino
why prepara una celada.
La vida no vale nada
si se sorprende otro hermano
cuando supe de antemano
lo que se le preparaba.
La vida no vale nada
si cuatro caen por minuto
why al final por el abuso
se decide la jornada.
La vida no vale nada
si tengo que posponer
otro minuto de ser
why morirme en una cama.
La vida no vale nada

no puedo cambiar qual fuera
lo que tengo why me ampara.
why por eso para mi

de lo que fue Santiago ensangrentada,
y en una hermosa plaza liberada
me detendré a llorar por los ausentes.

Yo vendré del desierto calcinante
y saldré de los bosques y los lagos,
y evocaré en un cerro de Santiago
a mis hermanos que murieron antes.

Yo unido al que hizo mucho y poco
al que quiere la patria liberada
dispararé las primeras balas
más temprano que tarde, sin reposo.

Retornarán los libros, las canciones
que quemaron las manos asesinas.
Renacerá mi pueblo de su ruina
y pagarán su culpa los traidores.

Un niño jugará en una alameda
y cantará con sus amigos nuevos,
y ese canto será el canto del suelo
a una vida segada en La Moneda.

Quisiera fuera una declaracion de amor
Romantica sin reparar en formas tales
Que ponga freno a lo que siento ahora a raudales

Te amo
Eternamente te amo
Si me faltaras no voy a morirme
Si he de morir quiero que sea contigo
Mi soledad se siente acompañada
Por eso a veces se que necesito
Tu mano
Tu mano
Eternamente tu mano
Cuando te vi sabia que era cierto
Este temor de hallarme descubierto
Tu me desnudas con siete razones
Me abres el pecho siempre que me colmas
De amores

Eternamente de amores

Renuncio a ver el sol cada mañana
Rezando el credo que me has enseñado
Miro tu cara why digo en la ventana

Pablo Milanés,"El nacimiento de un mundo se aplazó por un momento 
Un breve lapso del tiempo, del universo un segundo
Sin embargo parecía que todo se iba a acabar 
Con la distancia mortal que separó nuestra vidas

Realizaron la labor de desunir nuestras manos 
Y a pesar de ser hermanos nos miramos con temor
Cuando pasaron los años se acumularon rencores
Se olvidaron los amores, parecíamos extraños

Qué distancia tan sufrida, que mundo tan separado 
Jamás hubiera encontrado sin aportar nuevas vidas
Esclavo por una parte, servil criado por la otra
Es lo primero que nota el último en desatarse

Explotando esta misión de verlo todo tan claro 
Un día se vio liberal por esta revolución
Esto no fue un buen ejemplo para otros por liberar
La nueva labor fue aislar bloqueando toda experiencia

Lo que brilla con luz propia nadie lo puede apagar
Su brillo puede alcanzar la oscuridad de otras costas
Qué pagará este pesar del tiempo que se perdió.
De las vidas que costó, de las que puede costar

Lo pagará la unidad de los pueblos en cuestión
Y al que niegue esta razón la historia condenará
La historia lleva su carro y a muchos nos montará
Por encima pasará de aquel que quiera negarlo

No sin antes jurar que si no era contigo, jamás
Que esta herida me habría de matar

Ha pasado algo,
Cuando no soñé
Que fuera posible.

Donde te encontré
Ha crecido un árbol
Junto a un hondo lago
De tibio cristal.

Donde te encontré
Ha surgido un valle
Donde brilla un sol,
Donde canta un hombre.

Donde te encontré,
Donde tu me hallaste,
La noche es de estrellas
La luna es de mar.

Cuando te encontré
Cada criatura era un sueño
Que debía llegar
Con los buenos tiempos.

Cuando te encontré
Nada conocía su función,
No había la canción
Con qué besarte el viento.

Cuando te encontré
Todo era desconocido
Y el mundo nació
Del amor que hicimos.

Cuando te encontré
Aprendió la nube a pasar,
El ala a volar
Y el cielo a ser infinito.

Y lo que encontré
Se fue haciendo grande,
Desbordando el mar,
Despertando el tiempo.

Y tu corazón
Voló con el viento,
A veces en paz,
A veces violento.

Y esto que encontré
Ya no era desconocido,
Se hizo la canción
Que se había perdido.

No la perderé
Ni la mayor riqueza arrancará
Una concesión
A este clamor repartido.

Y se encontraran
Los del machete aguerrido

Que antes traicionar

Caminaré largo trecho

Tal vez sean ilusiones 
Pues si algo llega a pasar 
Yo no me voy a callar
Ni tú me harás concesiones

Cuando la esperanza ajena

Contra las malas ideas

Desaparece si miras otra vez
La fama va envileciendo
Ese pedazo intacto que queda de ti

Que te aguardan para hacerte
Bueno hasta el final

Las cosas que nunca tuve
Son tan sencillas

Tuve un árbol pero se secó
Tuve un niño y entre mis manos creció
Tuve un libro pero envejeció

Toda la inocencia que al nacer les dio

Las cosas que nunca tuve
Son tan sencillas
Como irlas a buscar

Por eso cuando te miro
Ya sin ninguna duda
Creo adivinar
Que estoy a un paso de la verdad

Bajo el oscuro, al temido
Raudal de la catarata
Y brilla el iris tendido

Miro ceñudo la agreste
Pompa del monte irritado
Y en el alma azul celeste
Brota un Jacinto rosado

Voy por el bosque a paseo
A la laguna vecina
Y entre las ramas la veo
Y por el agua camina

Por su agujero el clarín

Te hace mirar hasta
Trascender lo logrado
Te ve sentado descender

Pablo Milanés,"Negro como el comienzo de nuestro hermoso amor
Blanco como el destino que te di
Negro como los signos que favorecen
Ser blanco de los besos que merecí

Blanco como el azote de nuestro siglo, amén
Negro como el disparo que me mató
Blanco como la noche que acabará
Negro cual mi bandera para la paz

Blanco y negro resumen nuestro dolor
Negro y blanco nos unen para empezar
A limpiar la blancura que en su lugar
Dejará todo lo negro para el amor

Háblame de colores alrededor de ti
Del color de las flores que un día te di
Cuida que mis amores no se destiñan
Caleidoscopio eterno para vivir feliz

Que sufrías, que ya no esperabas ni un consuelo

Cuánto de niño pedí 
Cuánto de grande logré 
Qué es lo que me ha hecho feliz 
Qué cosa me ha de doler

Con el ansia de todo saber 
Pues el saberlo todo y con nostalgia 
Ver lo que se fue

Dónde estarán, a un lado de mi piel 
Los guardo bien y a veces brotarán 
Y endulzaran un brusco acontecer 
Llenándome de miel que muchos libarán

Sin salidas como muros.

Pablo Milanés,"Acuéstate a mi lado en esta noche
En que la soledad ya nos hermana
Acuéstate a mi lado en esta noche
Para poder amanecer mañana

No me entregues amor si no lo sientes
No me entregues un cuerpo enajenado
Entrega el corazón por una noche
Tu calor, tu silencio, tu mirada

No demores que el frío va calando
La pena que nos llega con el viento
Huyamos de la calle que nos mata
Como dos marginados de estos tiempos

Yo no te ofreceré nuevos placeres
Ni siquiera monedas que convencen
Te ofrezco acompañar la madrugada
Que yo creo que sientes y que siento

Cuando al fin amanezca
Y otros días, vengan a dar
La luz de un nuevo aliento
Esta noche será cual sentimiento
Que no he vuelto a sentir en esta vida

si puedes hasta entonces resistir 
me seguirás llevando  
de la mano contigo

me queda por decir que fui feliz

Se haga diamante tu lágrima 
Entre mis cuerdas 
Carito, suelta tu piedra

En Buenos Aires los zapatos son modernos 
Pero no lucen como en la plaza de un pueblo 
Deja que tu luz chiquitita 
Hable en secreto a la canción 
Para que te ilumine un poco más el sol

La misma estrella de aquel atardecer

Pablo Milanés,"Una mujer se ha perdido
Conocer el delirio y el polvo
Se ha perdido esta bella locura
Su breve cintura debajo de mí
Se ha perdido mi forma de amar
Se ha perdido mi huella en su mar

Veo una luz que vacila
Y promete dejarnos a oscuras
Veo un perro ladrando a la luna
Con otra figura que recuerda a mí
Veo más: veo que no me halló
Veo más: veo que se perdió

La cobardía es asunto
De los hombres, no de los amantes
Los amores cobardes no llegan a amores
Ni a historias, se quedan allí
Ni el recuerdo los puede salvar
Ni el mejor orador conjugar

Una mujer innombrable
Huye como una gaviota
Y yo rápido seco mis botas
Blasfemo una nota y apago el reloj
Qué me tenga cuidado el amor
Que le puedo cantar su canción

Como un cuadro del viejo chagall
Corrompiéndose al centro del miedo
Y yo, que no soy bueno, me puse a llorar
Pero entonces lloraba por mí
Y ahora lloro por verla morir",Oleo de Mujer Con Sombrero,2001

Me devolviste el retrato que en prueba de amor yo te di 
y me pediste tus cartas, en ellas decías así
""Te quiero mi cuchumbito, tú nunca me hagas sufrir""

Yo nunca usé la corbata, ni tampoco usé el pañuelo 
creyendo que así guardado conservaría el recuerdo

Las trazas se dieron cuenta que todo iba a ser traición 
se metieron en el cofre donde guardé mi pasión
destruyendo los recuerdos del engaño de un amor

Si he de morir quiero que sea contigo

Por eso a veces se que necesito

Me abres el pecho siempre que me colmas

Había que pensarlo muy bien
Que a esta unión de nosotros 
Le hacía falta carne y deseo también

Que no bastaba que me entendieras 
Y que murieras por mí
Que no bastaba que en mi fracaso 
Yo me refugiara en ti

Y ahora ves lo que pasó 
Al fin nació, al pasar de los años
El tremendo cansancio que provoco ya en ti
Y aunque es penoso lo tienes que decir

Por mi parte esperaba 
Que un día el tiempo se hiciera cargo del fin
Si así no hubiera sido 
Yo habría seguido jugando a hacerte feliz

Y aunque el llanto es amargo piensa en los años 
Que tienes para vivir
Que mi dolor no es menos y lo peor 
Es que ya no puedo sentir

Pórtate bien y frena 
Y, si la Magdalena pide un trago, 
Tú la invitas a cien que yo los pago 

Acércate a su puerta y llama 
Si te mueres de sed, 
Si ya no juegas a las damas ni con tu mujer 
Sólo te pido que me escribas, 
Contándome si sigue viva 
La virgen del pecado, 
La novia de la flor de la saliva, 
El sexo con amor de los casados 

Dueña de un corazón tan de cinco estrellas 
Que hasta el hijo de un Dios, 
Una vez que la vio, se fue con ella 
Y nunca le cobró 
La Magdalena 

Si estás más solo que la luna, déjate convencer, 
Brindando a mi salud, con una que yo me sé 
Y, cuando suban las bebidas 
El doble de lo que te pida 
Dale por sus favores 
Que, en casa de Marí­a de Magdalena 
Las malas compañí­as son las mejores 

Si llevas grasa en la guantera 
Y un alma que perder, 
Aparca junto a sus caderas de leche y miel 
Entre dos curvas redentoras 
La más prohibida de las frutas 
Te espera hasta la aurora, 
La más señora de todas las putas, 
La más puta de todas las señoras 

Con ese corazón tan de cinco estrellas",La Magdalena,2002
Pablo Milanés,"Lo que sentí, fue como un rayo en mi interior
Que me sorprende el corazón
Todo se rompe, todo estalla
Y algo acaba de morir

Para sentir otra manera de ser feliz
Otra de manera de sufrir
Otra manera de vivir
Lo que hasta ayer era reír

Qué pasara, adónde irán mis juegos a parar
Y mi inocencia a terminar
Qué nuevo amor será
Qué tal si me querrá

Qué voy a hacer si dice no
Ya yo no mando al corazón
Qué confusión, qué dicha, qué dolor

Siento al mirar que todo acaba de cambiar
Y veo las cosas para amar
Adiós infancia, ojalá que te recuerde
En mi vejez, con amor

Pablo Milanés,"Yo pisaré las calles nuevamente
de lo que fue Santiago ensangrentada,
y en una hermosa plaza liberada
me detendré a llorar por los ausentes.

Yo vendré del desierto calcinante
y saldré de los bosques y los lagos,
y evocaré en un cerro de Santiago
a mis hermanos que murieron antes.

Yo unido al que hizo mucho y poco
al que quiere la patria liberada
dispararé las primeras balas
más temprano que tarde, sin reposo.

Retornarán los libros, las canciones
que quemaron las manos asesinas.
Renacerá mi pueblo de su ruina
y pagarán su culpa los traidores.

Un niño jugará en una alameda
y cantará con sus amigos nuevos,
y ese canto será el canto del suelo
a una vida segada en La Moneda.

Medio par de zapatos de clown y un alma en almoneda
Una hispano olivetti con caries, un tren con retraso
Un carné del Atleti, una cara de culo de vaso

Un colegio de pago, un compás, una mesa camilla
Una nuez, o bocado de Adán, menos una costilla
Una bici diabética, un cúmulo, un cirro, una strato
Un camello del rey Baltasar, una gata sin gato

Mi Annie Hall, mi Gioconda, mi Wendy, las damas primero
Mi Cantinflas, mi Bola de Nieve, mis tres Mosqueteros
Mi Tintín, mi yo-yo, mi azulete, mi siete de copas

Mi escondite, mi clave de sol, mi reloj de pulsera
Una lámpara de Alí Babá dentro de una chistera
No sabía que la primavera duraba un segundo
Yo quería escribir la canción más hermosa del mundo

Les presento a mi abuelo bastardo, a mi esposa soltera
Al padrino que me apadrinó en la legión extranjera
A mi hermano gemelo, patrón de la merca ambulante
A Simbad el marino que tuvo un sobrino cantante

Al putón de mi prima Carlota y su perro salchicha
A mi chupa de cota de mallas contra la desdicha
Mariposas que cazan en sueños los niños con granos 
Cuando sueñan que abrazan a Venus de Milo sin manos

Me libré de los tontos por ciento, del cuento del bisnes
Dando clases en una academia de cantos de cisne
Con Simón de Cirene hice un tour por el monte Calvario
¿qué harías tú si Adelita se fuera con un comisario

Frente al cabo de poca esperanza arrié mi bandera
Si me pierdo de vista esperadme en la lista de espera
Heredé una botella de ron de un clochard moribundo
Olvidé la lección a la vuelta de un coma profundo

Nunca pude cantar de un tirón 
La canción de las babas del mar, del relámpago en vena
De las lágrimas para llorar cuando valga la pena
De la página encinta en el vientre de un bloc trotamundos
De la gota de tinta en el himno de los iracundos

Es el deber de no claudicar
El mandato de reflexionar
Qué es nacer, qué es morir, qué es amar
El hombre, por qué está hecho

Y qué eres tú, libertad
Libertad, libertad, libertad
La idea no es razonable

Tampoco el verbo fundamental
¿Es el alma principio o final
O armonía del bien frente al mal?
Qué es el amor insondable
Que empuja al cuerpo a ser incógnita inmortal

Y el testamento que va a dejar
Es un orden que quiere ocultar
El preciso compás del azar
A qué seguir respirando

Si no estás tú, libertad
Libertad, libertad, libertad

Todo lo que inspiras

Tú me has hecho volver
A la palabra amar
Mil veces repetida por hablar

No quiero despertarte de tus sueños
Prefiero contemplarte sin hablar
Quiero adorarte así
Con el silencio más hermoso
Como un feliz reposo para mí

Anunciando el día

Nada será igual
Nada queda ya
De lo que fue nuestro amor

Traté de olvidar
De borrar lo que fuiste
En mi vida triste
Cansado de andar

Paloma que quiso volar
Hacia nuevos cielos
Sin nada que amar

",Paloma Que Quiso Volar,2008
Pablo Milanés,"La posición de los astros me dice
Que estás llegando a mí
Un mundo de belleza
Y de alegría que pedí

Tiene que ver con el curso que
Impone la naturaleza
Una explosión de
Flores inunda mi raíz

Para mi goce está verde el maíz
El colibrí se ha posado en mi sien
Los mares quietos proponen
Un lecho de paz la tierra descansa bien

Nada nos cuesta vivir en los sueños
El mundo que pensamos
Mañana despertamos
A enfrentarnos a lo real

Llega la noche
Me invade el cansancio
De un día de bregar
Me voy hasta mi lecho
Nada nos cuesta soñar

",Soñando,2008
Pablo Milanés,"El tiempo pasa, los años van llegando
Aunque no te hagan daño
Como ayer la vida es sabia
La muerte lo es también

Todo se acaba y tú te vas quedando
En tu portal mirando
Para ver tú sombra triste
Andando sin volver

Nada me vale lo mismo que ayer
Hay cien motivos para no creer
Lo que ayer era una ilusión
Hoy se impone como una razón

No hay espíritu, no hay corazón
Quiero volver
Quiero aferrarme a mi pasado
¿Dónde está?

",Suicidio,2008
Pablo Milanés,"Quién dijo que todo está perdido? 
Yo vengo a ofrecer mi corazón
Tanta sangre que se llevó el rí­o, 
Yo vengo a ofrecer mi corazón 

No será tan fácil, ya sé qué pasa,
No será tan simple como pensaba,
Como abrir el pecho y sacar el alma,
Una cuchillada del amor

Luna de los pobres siempre abierta,
Yo vengo a ofrecer mi corazón
Como un documento inalterable
Yo vengo a ofrecer mi corazón

Y uniré las puntas de un mismo lazo,
Y me iré tranquila, me iré despacio,
Y te daré todo, y me darás algo,
Algo que me alivie un poco más

Cuando no haya nadie cerca o lejos,
Yo vengo a ofrecer mi corazón
Cuando los satélites no alcancen,
Yo vengo a ofrecer mi corazón

Y hablo de paí­ses y de esperanzas,
Hablo por la vida, hablo por la nada,
Hablo de cambiar ésta nuestra casa,
De cambiarla por cambiar, nomás

Quién dijo que todo está perdido? 
Yo vengo a ofrecer mi corazón",Yo Vengo a Ofrecer Mi Corazón,2009
Pablo Milanés,"Esto no puede ser no mas que una cancion
Quisiera fuera una declaracion de amor
Romantica sin reparar en formas tales
Que ponga freno a lo que siento ahora a raudales
Te amo
Te amo
Eternamente te amo
Si me faltaras no voy a morirme
Si he de morir quiero que sea contigo
Mi soledad se siente acompañada
Por eso a veces se que necesito
Tu mano
Tu mano
Eternamente tu mano
Cuando te vi sabia que era cierto
Este temor de hallarme descubierto
Tu me desnudas con siete razones
Me abres el pecho siempre que me colmas
De amores
De amores
Eternamente de amores
Si alguna vez me siento derrotado
Renuncio a ver el sol cada mañana
Rezando el credo que me has enseñado
Miro tu cara why digo en la ventana

Llegaste con tu cinta, amarrando en tu cabeza
todo el viejo pasado que moría
y tus ojos color de esperanza me dijeron
que sufrías, que ya no esperabas ni un consuelo

Y de pronto el pasado reciente retornó
y no quise llenarme el pecho de ternura
porque tengo temor, porque siento el dolor
que tu amor me causaría
Yo no quiero sufrir, yo prefiero morir

se metieron en el cofre donde guardé mi pasión

Caricias de miel que las olas, el mar se llevo

Y te entregabas hasta el fin
¡Para beber del agua pura de mi amor!

Cuando me diste en cada beso entero el corazón
Se te olvidó, que me querías
Y me decías que serías sólo para mí
Enamorada y ahora ya no estás

Soñabas conmigo entre sabanas blancas
Contabas las horas por verme si no estaba, yo

Hay anhelos sinceros que un día se fueron
Tristezas que llevo, y que hoy me desgarran
Pesares atados a un tiempo, que no volverá

Se te olvidó
Cuando decías que te hiciera eternamente mía
Y te entregabas hasta el fin
¡Para beber del agua pura de mi amor!

Se te olvidó
Cuando me diste en cada beso entero el corazón
Se te olvidó, que me querías
Y me decías que serías sólo para mí
Enamorada y ahora ya no estás

",Se Te Olivido [Version Ranchera][*],2005
Pablo Montero,"Sé que el amor no se puede esconder
Que a través de los ojos se ve
Cuando amas te lo grita la piel

Sé el peligro que puedes correr
Cuando quieres seguir siendo libré
Y llega sin aviso esa mujer

Vas a entender lo que es enamorarse
Como no te importa nadie
Cuando estás junto a ella
No la quieres perder

Vas a entender la pasión de los amantes
El dolor de separarse y la inmensa alegría
De volverla a tener

Sé que la vida te puede cambiar
A pesar de jurar y apostar que
De amores nunca vas a enfermar

Sé el peligro que puedes correr
Cuando quieres seguir siendo libré
Y llega sin aviso esa mujer

Vas a entender lo que es enamorarse
Como no te importa nadie
Cuando estás junto a ella
No la quieres perder

Vas a entender la pasión de los amantes
El dolor de separarse y la inmensa alegría
De volverla a tener

Y te vas a olvidar de tu vida anterior
Y hasta vas a esquivar a tu amigo el mejor
No será nada igual para tu corazón

Vas a entender lo que es enamorarse
Como no te importa nadie
Cuando estás junto a ella
No la quieres perder

Vas a entender la pasión de los amantes
El dolor de separarse y la inmensa alegría
De volverla a tener

Pero mis ojos se mueren si mirar tus ojos
Y mi cariño con la aurora te vuelve a esperar

Y aggaraste por tu cuenta la parranda
Paloma negra paloma negra dónde, dónde andarás?
Ya no jueges con mi honra parrandera
Si tus caricias han de ser mías, de nadie mas

Pablo Papacostas,"El amor es un rayo de luz indirecta
Una gota de paz
Una fe que despierta
Un zumbido en el aire

Un punto en la niebla
Un perfil
Una sombra
Una pausa
Una espera
El amor es un suave rumor que se acerca
Un timbre a lo lejos
Una brisa ligera

Una voz en la calma
Un aroma de menta
Un después un quizás un haber
Una meta
El amor va brotando entre el aire y el suelo
Y se palpa
Y se siente

Y hay quien puede verlo
Y hace que te despiertes y pienses en el
Y te llama despacio rozando tu piel
El amor te hipnotiza te hace soñar
Y sueñas y cedes y te dejas llevar
Y te mueve por dentro
Y te hace ser mas
Y te empuja y te puede y te lleva detrás

Y de pronto te alza te lanza te quema
Hace luz en tu alma
Hace fuego en tus venas
Y te hace gritar al sentir que te quema
Te disuelve te evapora te destruye te crea
Y te hace viajar en el filo del tiempo 
Remontando los ríos en mil universos
Y te lleva a la gloria y te entrega a la tierra
Y te mira y te ve y piensa y piensa

Y de pronto el amor es la luz de una llama.
Que se empieza a apagar y se va y se apaga.
Es la isla pequeña perdida en la niebla.
Una gota un no se

Una mancha
Una mueca
El amor es la hoja caída en la tierra
Un punto en el mar
Una bruma que espesa
Un pelo en el alma
Un sol que se vela
Un por que?
Un segundo
Un ya no

Una queja
El amor va bajando

Peldaño a peldaño
Con las manos cerradas
Y el paso cansado
Te pregunta quien eres?
Para hacerte saber
Que apenas te conoce
Que que quieres de el?
El amor te hace burla se ríe de ti
Mientras tu sigues quieto sin saber que decir y deseas seguirle
Y decirle que no
Que se quede que vuelva
Que comete un error
Y el amor desbarata tus grandes ideas
Te destroza te rompe
Te parte te quiebra
Y te hace ser ese que tu no quisieras
Y te empuja a ser malo
Y te deja hecho mierda
Y te arroja de bruces
Al ultimo infierno
Arrancándote el alma
Pisandote el cuerpo
Y te ahogas de ancias de volver
A la nada
Y de pronto
Separa y te ve y se apiada

Full clip, one up in the chamber, danger
Ask you what you want, what's the flavor?

Invested twenty-nine point eight, spent the change up
Never been the type to take advice from a stranger
Gun next to me like my neighbor
Stay tough, spit the hot shit to get the paper
I roll with more force than Darth Vader
Let's see what you made of

Like let my niggas out the devil's lair, or I'll spray ya

Check before I mark your gear, call y'all queers
Could rock steady for four more years, all y'all scared

Quick to cop, pop me in their cd-rom and stare
Even if our cliques don't get along, who care

You need to lighten up, digest a few beers
Before you end up meeting the man you do fear

Like my niggas out the devil's lair, or I'll spray ya
niggas thought they couldn't be beat, no love
Think it's all coming we speak, no sir
The fact that I'm usually deep in most clubs
You know it's going down when I'm creepin' close up
You non-descript niggas might sneak and throw duds
But when the bomb go off, those who sleeping woke up
Pacewon, cock my heat back, and blow slugs

My sister used to say that I shoulda been a cop
'til I pulled up in the fully tinted drop
Until I rapped on the ninety-six album of the year
Now she don't think I'm so weird
Now when I pop in the tape she want to listen
Kissin my ass; like back in ninety-five she wasn't dissin
Now I got a deal and I'm steppin with a piston
C.O. executive position
The wisdom of a man doin life inside prison
All he do is read, smoke stogs, and be liftin
The vision of how I can overcome the system
Pace will be a legend in his time like Sonny Liston - locked

Yo I got it locked, on the real I got it locked
Rollin with the kids that want to rock
Yo no doubt I got it locked, word life I got it locked
Whip my 540 on your block

Keep my mother lookin lovely, give her money
See I need the finest in life, cameras and lights
Hammers and ice, people feel me - the good stuff!
Blow my whole neighborhood up, glad I stood up
Put flavor in your mix like sugar
Lock your girl down like Booker; never fall in love with a hooker
or cracked out broads that smoke cook-up
Could be she fine now well off and she a looker
and know how to work the pressure cooker
But drugs is more addictive than love, kisses and hugs
People slip and get hung, grippin they lung
My nigga gettin this money is my number one agenda
Tie your raps up like, ""please return to sender""

Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree

But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri

I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?""

Told me call her Sweet T didn't know she'd be so sour, got the digits ready to hit it, said call her in about an hour. So I hit her on the beep, said I woke her out of sleep, conversation got real deep, I say what's up wit a late night creep. She said that was good and cool, pick her up at 9 o'clock, no need rent a hotel she said she had her own little private spot. So I hit the shower black, thinking bout benna benna gar, didn't think next in the dirt would be my muthafuckin nuts. Cause this bitch was real fine, on that level of my nine, who would have thought to think this bitch would label me as Jimmy Wine. Pulled up in her driveway slow, creeping so I didn't blow, gangsta walked up to her door and told dat hoe come on lets go. Headed to our designation, she was actin' real calm, ask her why her pants so tight she said it keeps her pussy warm. She was talkin durty tought and my dick was getting hard. She said apartment 44 right next to that vacant yard. Got inside and dim the lights, smoked a blunt to set the mood, busted a move unlaced my shoes got in my lay back attitude. Threw that bitch across the bed, fuck me written cross her head, wildin like a stalin and she rode me like a thurebred. Next thing you know I feel asleep woke up and the bitch was gone. Niggas standin over aimin barrels at my dome, tried to move but I couldn't budge, duck tape held my movement still. Blood gon spill if I'm dead cause that trick set me up for the kill, heard a blast, I feel a burn, he ran through my testicals, run lick, recovered my clothes, blood was drippin out my nose. Only vision at my sight, found myself getting kind of weak, gasping for air trying to catch my voice but couldn't even speak, now my family gon eat, cause I'm 		 without me, should've check the bitch instead I was sleepin with the muthafuckin enemy.

They'll fade ya

Sei come sei non cambi mai sei imprevedibile -

E poi la sera in questa vita mia con te.

Col muso per un vecchio rancore o col sorriso migliore.

Paco Nula,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret

To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start

With her first hello
She gave new meaning to this empty world of mine
There'd never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart

She fills my heart with very special things
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go I'm never lonely
With her around, who could be lonely
I reach for her hand, it's always there

How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answers now but this much I can say
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away
And she'll be there

Dead meat hung on a rock

And lose the brains inside your head

You shouldn't ought'a listen to the plastic man

And there's no more toilet paper
It's gone just like the trees
Do you like the taste of honey
Isn't it best without the bees
Be careful what you're doing
You're messing up my life
And if all the world's a cake
Then you cut too big a slice

What's it all about
They scream and then they shout
Don't ask me
Cause I don't know
What's it all about
They scream and then they shout
Don't blame me
I told you so
You read it in the papers
You hear it on the news
Very few listen
A spew without a view
And is it really worth it
Choking on remote
I can see the red tide coming
But I don't even vote
Infection in the greenhouse
Dizzy in the clouds
Oily as an ocean
Heaven disembowelled
Still planning on a future
Well lucky for some

You can develop your body
But your mind is still a slum

The product in the packaging
Of multi-layered glam
150 layers of materials
To cover up a sham
Protecting my planet
Wrap it in plastic
The package is product
Perfected eternal
A crap in a cling wrap
I never met yet a prime minister or president
Who told the truth yet

Swimming in the slurry
Burning in the heat
Wind blown is the weather
I eat what you secrete
Climb the highest derrick
This circus has no prayer
No UFO to save us
And do we really care

Kiss goodbye to the earth, the sun, the moon

On the veranda

Wanted chocolates instead

Paddy Casey,"I'm sure not feelin' tough
Sure not feeling tall
Sure that you are not feeling me at all
You know I could be right sure that I'm not wrong
But I'm sure that time was meant for more than just getting along
So let's not just get along
Let's get along in style
'Cause you know I'm pretty sure this is more worthwhile
So I think it's time we gave this thing the hard sell
'Cause love was meant to live
And not merely just to dwell
No just to dwell

So tonight I want to be that line
The one that I just sold out
Tonight I want to be that story
The one that I just told you
Let's take it to the land of fantasy
Where all things are real
Where the enemy's not a ghost
But one you can touch and feel
And the chains they are not mental
But their only made of steel
And the magic's elemental and the right words can heal
Let's become that dignity
Become that grace
It's time to light your candles in a dark and lonely place",Promised Land,2004
Paddy Gibney,"I saw her face on a late night TV screen
I saw her face on the cover of a magazine
My destination, my thought's unclean
She must have been some kind of beauty queen

That kind of beauty
That kind of beauty makes me sad
That kind of beauty
That kind of beauty makes me bad
I close my eyes and drift into fantasy
Till she is lying right there next to me
So suddenly real, I see her vanity
She's not the girl I thought she'd be

That kind of beauty
Her kind of beauty makes me sad
That kind of beauty
I realize drives me mad. Yeah

Rock n Roll it stole my soul
When I realized that music sets me free
Oh how it sets me free
Where my reality is fantasy
Pain don't mean that much to me
Because beauty, that beauty
Tears the heart from me

My little problem makes life so tough
Too many people have called my bluff
Pretty soon I'll run out of luck
I'm off home to you my love
I've had enough

That kind of beauty, your kind of beauty
Makes me sad
That kind of beauty, I realize
I've often had, and it drives me mad
Makes me sad, oh so bad
Now I'm bad",Destiny,2001
Paddy Gibney,"Help me understand
Why it had to be
She could walk on water
Or so it seemed to me
She must have come from God
She's back with Him forever
Budded here on earth
To bloom in heaven 

I don't have the words
And words cannot explain
How someone could give such love
And live through so much pain
It all must come from God
She's back with Him forever
Budded here on earth
To bloom in heaven

I can see her now
At God's right hand
With angels all around her
And so she passed
Free at last

Paddy Gibney,"You knew I was wrong
But you did it anyway
You said I would live to love
Another day
In my darkest hour
I see your smiling face
I knew you weren't good for me
When I first came to this place

Yours was a love that meant so much
But it pushed me 'round and beat me up
Until I found myself upon the floor
But I am strong and I'll go on
You exist only in this song
Watch me walking out the door
Saying Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye

I knew it was wrong
But I did it anyway
I passed the point of no return
Somewhere along the way
In my darkest hour
I see a silhouette
It has the eyes that had seduced me
It has a face I won't forget

Yours was a love that meant so much
But it pushed me 'round and beat me up
Until I found myself upon the floor
But I am strong and I'll go on
You exist only in this song
Did you really think
I'd be coming back for more

So Goodbye, Goodbye to you, 
Goodbye to me

To all you feeling down
Take heart my friends
Because the world keeps turning round
And it will pick you up again
In your darkest hour
When you can't get off the floor
Remember, God may have closed a window
But He will open up a door

So forget that love that meant so much
That pushed you around and beat you up
Remember that this life is like a song
There's a constant search for harmony
For the chords of life and its melody
So get up off the floor and sing my song

Sing Goodbye, Sing Goodbye, Sing
Goodbye Sing Goodbye, Sing Goodbye
To you, Goodbye to me. And so be free.",Goodbye,2001
Paddy Goes to Holyhead,"Come on, you raging soldiers, wherever you may be
I'd have to pay attention; please listen unto me
I'll tell to you a true tale of a soldier bold and brave
An ambush of some enemies dispatched him in his grave

It happened on a Friday morn, so listen to what they've done
They walked upon the mountains, the battle's just begun
The colonel cried, ""Turn out, brave boys; your hearts are void of fear!""
They shot him without warning as you shall quickly hear

They buried him quite decently on a dreary summer's day
Come all the rest of you, my boys, for your dead comrade, pray
Too many died for nothing to finish endless strife
In mem'ry of the millions felled for a better life

Civil war in Central Europe, civil rights are on the run
Destination is destruction, and the war goes on and on",Civil War,1994
Paddy Goes to Holyhead,"A guy is walking around 
In this grave underground
Instead of sleeping

He's got the skill from his Ma
And the curse from his Pa
And he's creeping

Benga is his name 
And he's driving you insane
He's incorporating human souls

And that's his destiny,
Which gives him energy
To get you out of control

[Chorus]
Oh, when the nightmare comes 
There's a shadow goin' round and round and round
If you call his name 
Yeah, when the nightmare comes
He can hear your poor heart beatin'
And he's left your soul in pain 
(Left your soul in painâ?¦)

If he's taking a soul
On his rage night patrol
He starts walking

And he never feels pain
You can't explain
There's no talking

You'll have to find the tree
Of this sense-ability
And beat the tree instead of this guy

No more walking around
In this grave underground
Now you're satisfied

You'll have to find the tree

Take care of yourself everywhere and hold your head up high 
The moon is shining clearly and the stars are shining bright 
This will be a last song for tonight 
When I´m old and doddering and my race is almost run 
Will you ever think of me will you miss me when I´m gone 

Forget all pain and sorrow come and rest here by my side 
This will be a last song for tonight

And pictures in frames

Of a guy with no name? 

Brother can you help me

Tomorrow I'll sell it all 
To an art businessman 

Hard times for an artist 
With contrary mind 
Scaremongers everywhere 
Short-sighted and blind

Boundary's effaced 
It's better to make an end 
Than to live in disgrace
