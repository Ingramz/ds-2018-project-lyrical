Michael Cera,"You're a part-time lover and a full-time friend
The monkey on your back is the latest trend
Don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Here is the church and here is the steeple
We sure are cute for two ugly people
Don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

We both have shiny happy fits of rage
I want more fans, you want more stage
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

You're always trying to keep it real
And I'm in love with how you feel
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train
I kiss you all starry-eyed, my body's swinging from side to side
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me
So why can't you forgive me?
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you

Doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo-doo
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you",Anyone Else But You,2008
Michael Cerveris,"A customer!
Wait! What's your rush?
What's your hurry?
You gave me such a...
fright! I thought you was a ghost!
Half a minute, can't ya sit?
Sit ya down!
Sit!
All I meant is that I haven't seen a customer for weeks.
Did ya come here for a pie, sir?
Do forgive me if my head's a little vague.
Ugh!
What is that?
But you'd think we had the plague.
From the way that people
keep avoiding!
No you don't!
Heaven knows I try, sir!
But there's no one comes in even to inhale!
Right you are, sir, would you like a drop of ale?
Mind you I can hardly blame them!
These are probably the worst pies in London.
I know why nobody cares to take them!
I should know!
I make them!
But good? No
The worst pies in London
Even that's polite! The worst pies in London!
If you doubt it take a bite!

Ugh!

Is that just, disgusting?
You have to concede it!
It's nothing but crusting!
Here drink this, you'll need it.
The worst pies in London
And no wonder with the price of meat
what it is
when you get it.
Never thought I'd live to see the day.
Men'd think it was a treat
findin' poor
animals
what are dyin' in the street.
Mrs. Mooney has a pie shop.
Does a business, but I notice something weird.
Lately, all her neighbors cats have disappeared.
Have to hand it to her!
What I calls,
enterprise!
Poppin' pussies into pies!
Wouldn't do in my shop!
Just the thought of it's enough to make you sick!
And I'm telling you them pussycats is quick.
No denying times is hard, sir!
Even harder than the worst pies in London.
Only lard and nothing more-
Is that just revolting?
All greasy and gritty?
It looks like it's molting!
And tastes like...we'll pity.
A woman alone...with limited wind
And the worst pies in London!
Ah, sir
Times is hard.
Times is hard.

Isn't that a room up there? Over the shop?",The Worst Pies In London,2008
Michael Chapdelaine,"How can I just let you walk away,
Just let you leave without a trace?
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Take a look at me now

Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face, oh

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And it's what I've got to face
Take a look at me now",Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now) [From Against All Odds],1996
Michael Chapdelaine,"Thanks for the times that you've given me,
The memories are all in mind.
And now that we've come
To the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud!

Your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you.
Yes, your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you!

When we are together
The moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart.

That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her to
I love her

She gives my everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I 
Have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die

Michael Chapdelaine,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere",1996
Michael Chapdelaine,"How gentle is the rain, that falls softly on the meadow;
Birds high upon the trees serenade the flow'rs with their melodies.
Oh, see there beyond the hill, the bright colors of the rainbow;
Some magic from above made this day for us, just to fall in love.

Michael Chapdelaine,"When I'm feelin' blue, all I have to do is take a look at you,
Then I'm not so blue.
When you're close to me I can feel you heart beat 
I can hear you breathing in my ear.
 
Wouldn't you agree, baby, you and me got  a groovy kind of love.
We got a groovy kind of love.
 
Any time you want to you can turn me on to anything you want to. 
Any time at all.
When I taste your lips 
Oh, I start to shiver can't control the quivering inside.
 
Wouldn't you  agree, baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love.

Michael Chapdelaine,"Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't live for tomorrow,
Tomorrow's much too long
I'll burn my eyes out
Before I get out

I wanted more
Than life could ever grant me
Bored by the chore
Of saving face

Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't wait for tomorrow
I might not have that long
I'll tear my heart out
Before I get out

Pink ribbon scars
That never forget
I tried so hard
To cleanse these regrets
My angel wings
Were bruised and restrained
My belly stings

Michael Chertock,"You're a mean one, Mr Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mr. Grinch!
You're a bad banana
With a greasy black peel!

You're a monster, Mr. Grinch!
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul
Mr. Grinch!
I wouldn't touch you
With a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole!

You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch!
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile
Mr. Grinch!
Given the choice between the two of you
I'd take the seasick crocodile!

You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch!
You're a nasty, wasty skunk!
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk
Mr. Grinch!
The three words that best describe you
Are as follows, and I quote
""Stink, stank, stunk!""

You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch!
You're the king of sinful sots!
Your heart's a dead tomato
Splotched with moldy, purple spots
Mr. Grinch!
Your soul is an apalling dump-heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful 
Assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled-up in tangled-up knots!

You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch!
With a nauseous super naus!
You're a crooked jerky jockey
And you drive a crooked hoss

And toadstool sandwich
With arsenic sauce!","You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch [From How the Grinch Stole Christmas]",1998

Michael Chertock,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go

""Remember,"" is a place from long ago

Remember, close your eyes and you can see
Remember, think of all that life can be, remember
Dream,love is only in a dream, remember

Michael Chertock,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000
Michael Christmas,"As high as a striped bird, ballin'
Fuck the Lakers! Except Lonzo, don't leave that out
Free L'Angelo, buddy ain't do shit

Ball, get a crib that's high as a scraper
Ball like a Laker. Fuck the Lakers
Ball like LaVar, I'm 'bout my paper
Bought my mom a crib where she got no neighbors
Ain't it slow for you hoe niggas when I ball
I told you I would ball, nigga, didn't I ball?
And I might not see you later
And hear my prayer
God, let me ball

Ball please, pass me the ball, please
So I can go off-key, spin move, off-three
If that shit go in, newspapers all me
Fat boy the maker, not yet but he stay hood
Nerdy as hell, I been layin' off the squares

Finally not bitin' my nails, I'm in the air like Nimbus
Hercules, Mount Olympus, Hades plottin' on me since I was a baby

Then press the hitstick, you hit the sideline, Bobby Bushay to the bullshit

I need to chill and kill it back-to-back like Drizzy Mill
With Miley Cyrus dissin' rap and twerkin' ass like Hank Hill
And then I'm s'posed to act like I can take it as a joke
Be hearin' sly shit from the nervous white folks
Don't trip, I like those that don't trip about my skin, or my lips, or my gold
'Cause when ET phone home, he call me like [?]
I came back to pick my mans up, plan to jump another planet
God let me ball, God let me Andre the Giant
Chokeslam the rap game, I'm so damn defiant
'Cause I'm gettin' high and I'm not bein' violent (swish)
Whatever, man (bitch)
I gotta get my shit together man

It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you

Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

She don't have to be assured of many good things to find 
And she'll always be there, my love don't care about time

Michael Cleveland,"While we are living in this world of care
Many the burdens that we have to bear
But there's a prayer bell at the Lord's right hand
Give it a ring and He will understand

   Prayer bells of heaven oh how sweetly they ring
   Bearing a message unto Jesus our king
   When you are burdened down with sorrows and care
   Ring on and on for God will answer your prayer

Three Hebrew children to the fire were thrown
Because a worldly king they would not own
Jesus delivered and the king then saw
Prayer bells of heaven beat a man made law

When Paul and Silas were thrown into jail
They didn't worry who would go their bail
But on the prayer bells they began to ring
Off fell the stocks and they begin to sing

Into the garden Jesus went to pray
Until His sweat became as blood they say
Ringing the prayer bells there in agony
Bringing salvation that we might be free

It hurts to know your love is gone

Will you be satisfied that way

Will you be satisfied to roam
Will memories fade when you are gone
A new love led your heart astray
Will you be satisfied that way

It's hard to stay when love is cold
So often that this story told
I'm not asking that you pity me
Will you be satisfied that way

Will you be satisfied to know
You left a heart that's beating low
Somehow somewhere you'll have to pay
Will you be satisfied that way

Love can't be bought it must be free

Michael Crawford,"The colors of my life, are bountiful and bold
The purple glow of indigo, the gleam of green and gold
The splendor of a sunrise, the dazzle of a flame
The glory of a rainbow, I put 'em all to shame

No quiet browns or grays, I'll take my days instead
And fill them 'til they overflow, with rose and cherry red
And should this sunlit world, grow dark one day
The colors of my life will leave a shining light to show the way

The colors of my life, are softer than a breeze
The silver gray of [Incomprehensible] the dappled green of trees
Amber of a wheat field, hazel of a seed
Crystal of a raindrop are all I'll ever need

Your reds are much too bold, in gold I find no worth
I fill my days with [Incomprehensible] brown, the colors of the earth
And if from by my side my love should roam
The colors of my life will shine a quiet light to lead her home

",The Colours Of My Life [Reprise],1980
Michael Crawford,"Somewhere over the rainbow way up high
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Birds fly over the rainbow. Why then, oh, why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow why, oh, why can't I?",Over the Rainbow,1987
Michael Crawford,"Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is shining alone.
In the lamplight the whithered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan.
Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses wither away
Like the sunflower I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day
Now Old Deuteronomy, just before dawn
Through a silence you feel you could cut with a knife
Announces the cat who can now be reborn
And come back to a different jellicle life
Memory, turn your face to the moonlight
Let your memory lead you
Open up, enter in
If you find there the meaning of what happiness is
Then a new life will begin
Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Burnt out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning
Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin
Sunlight, through the trees in the summer
Endless masquerading
Like a flower as the dawn is breaking
The memory is fading
Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun

Darkness wakes and stirs imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses
Helpless to resist the notes I write

Slowly, gently night unfurls it's splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Hearing is believing, music is deceiving
Hard as lightening, soft as candlelight
Dare you trust the music of the night

Close your eyes for your eyes will only tell the truth
and the truth isn't what you want to see
In the dark it is easy to pretend
That the truth is what it ought to be

Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
hear it, fear it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Close your eyes, start a journey to a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Close your eyes and let music set you free
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savour each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

If there is a way
Take this cup away from me

As when we started
Then I was inspired
Now I'm sad and tired
Listen surely I've exceeded
Expectations
Tried for three years
Seems like thirty
Could you ask as much
From any other man?

But if I die
See the saga through
And do the things you ask of me
Let them hate me, hit me, hurt me
Nail me to their tree
I'd want to know
I'd want to know my God
I'd want to know

I'd want to see

Than I ever was before?
Would the things I've said and done
Matter any more?

Can you show me now
That I would not be killed in vain?
Show me just a little
Of your omnipresent brain
Show me there's a reason
For your wanting me to die
You're far too keen on where and how
But not so hot on why
Alright I'll die!
Just watch me die!
See how, see how I die!

Michael Crawford,"Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is shining alone.
In the lamplight the whithered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan.
Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses wither away
Like the sunflower I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day
Now Old Deuteronomy, just before dawn
Through a silence you feel you could cut with a knife
Announces the cat who can now be reborn
And come back to a different jellicle life
Memory, turn your face to the moonlight
Let your memory lead you
Open up, enter in
If you find there the meaning of what happiness is
Then a new life will begin
Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Burnt out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning
Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin
Sunlight, through the trees in the summer
Endless masquerading
Like a flower as the dawn is breaking
The memory is fading
Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun
",Memory,1991
Michael Crawford,"Night time, sharpens, heightens each sensation,
Darkness stirs, and wakes imagination,
Silently the senses, abandon their defenses,

Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender,
Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn you face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night",The Music of the Night,1991
Michael Crawford,"Look at me, a woman, calm and in control
No silly girl, who's head's always turning
Nobody would guess that deep inside my soul
A brand new flame is burning

Only you have the power to move me
And together we'd make the whole world move in sympathy
And I couldn't see before

And only you have the power to move me
Take me, hold me, mold me, change me and improve me
It's not funny anymore, anymore

There was I, wondering why
Everyday disappeared into the distance
Now with you, the light is shining through
You gave me life, not just existence

Only you have the power to move me
And together we'd make the whole world move in sympathy
You have the power to move me

All the nights I've wasted, dreaming of the time
When I'd discovered the one to guide me
Searching the horizon, didn't realize
That all the time she was beside me

Only you have the power to move me
And together we'd make the whole world move in sympathy
Hope and pray that I'm in time, I'm in time

Only he can stand and wait that long
Stand by me while I was going wrong
What if she couldn't wait? Have I left it too late?

Only you have the power to move me
And together we'll make the whole world move in sympathy
Brighten up the darkest sky

If only you use the power to move me
Take me, hold me, mold me, change me and improve me
Only you have the power to move me
Only you

No long faces, no long looks
No deep conversation

You were all that mattered
You were once a friend and father
Then my world was shattered

Wishing you were somehow here again
Wishing you were somehow near
Sometimes it seemed
If I just dreamed
Somehow you would be here

Wishing I could hear your voice again
Knowing that I never would
Dreaming of you won't help me to do
All that you dreamed I could

Passing bells and sculpted angels
Cold and monumental
Seem for you the wrong companions
You were warm and gentle

Too many years fighting back tears
Why can't the past just die?

Wishing you were somehow here again
Knowing we must say goodbye
Try to forgive, teach me to live
Give me the strength to try

No more memories, no more silent tears
No more gazing across the wasted years
Help me say goodbye

Silent stars, light from a distant flame
Just like the memories of you that I hold inside
I feel you touch but all the warmth has died

But the nights alone can be an eternity
That never heals the scars of foolish pride

If only you could see me, now
Goodbye is not so easy, now
The freedom that I walked away to gain
Is nothing but these chains
That you alone can break

And you would free me, now
Your heart would come undone
Just looking at me once
And my love would bring you back
If only you could see me, now

Here I am, stranger to a smile
Trying to fight the tears, missing by a mile
I'm not the one who laughed at you on that yesterday
When you warned me not to throw your love away

If you could only see me, now
Goodbye is not so easy, now
The freedom that I walked away to gain
Is nothing but these chains
I know your heart would break

If you could hear me, now
Your heart would come undone
If you could hear me once
Hoping love will bring you back
If only you could see me, now

That sails the dark alone forever
I have no light of my own
Other the love we've known
So long ago, together

The wind is so much colder;

Can you hear me praying,
Anything I'm saying

I remember everything you taught me
Every book 1've ever read...
Can all the words in all the books
Help me to face what lies ahead?

And I feel so much smaller;
The moon is twice as lonely
And the stars are half as bright...

Papa, how I miss you

If youve never flown at all.

Though its safer to stay on the ground,
Sometimes where danger lies
There the sweetest of pleasures are found.
No matter where I go-
Therell be memries that tug at my sleeve
But there will also be
More to question yet more to believe.

(oh tell me where-
Where is the someone who will turn to look at me
And want to sahre
My evry sweet-imagined possibility? )

The more I live - the more I learn.
The more I learn - the more I realize
The less I know.
Each step I take-
(papa, Ive a voice now!)
Each page I turn-
(papa, Ive a choice now!)
Each mile I travel only means
The more I have to go.
Whats wrong with wanting more? 
If you can fly - then soar!
With all there is - why settle for
Just a piece of sky?

And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more

Hard as lightning, soft as candle light,

There you trust the music of the night

Close your eyes,

That the truth is what it ought to be

Softly,

Barbra
Deafening,

Both
Music shall caress you.

Barbra
Hear it,

Michael
Feel it,

Both
Secretly posses you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind,
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight,
The darkness of the music of the night...

Close your eyes start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before!
Close your eyes and let music set you free!

Only then can you belong to me

Floating (floating), falling (falling)
Sweet intoxication!
Touch me (touch me), trust me (trust me)
Savor each sensation!

Let the dream begin,
Let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write,
The power of the music of the night!

Michael Crawford,"Oh holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, oh night divine

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and the gospel is peace

Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name

Christ is the Lord that ever never praise we

Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you see me?
Papa can you find me in the night?
Papa are you near me?
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you help me not be frightened?
Looking at the skies I seem to see
A million eyes which ones are yours?
Where are you now that yesterday
Has waved goodbye 
And closed its doors?
The night is so much darker;
The wind is so much colder;
The world I see is so much bigger
Now that I'm alone.
Papa, please forgive me.
Try to understand me;
Papa, don't you know I had no choice?
Can you hear me praying,
Anything I'm saying
Even though the night is filled with voices?
I remember everything you taught me
Every book 1've ever read...
Can all the words in all the books
Help me to face what lies ahead?
The trees are so much taller
And I feel so much smaller;
The moon is twice as lonely
And the stars are half as bright...

Papa, how I need you.
Papa, how I miss you

	That saved a wretch like me.
	I once was lost, but now am found,
	Was blind, but now I see.

	'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
	And grace my fears relieved.
	How precious did that grace appear
	The hour I first believed.

	Through many dangers, toils and snares
	I have already come;
	'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
	And grace will lead me home.

	The Lord has promised good to me
	His word my hope secures;
	He will my shield and portion be,
	As long as life endures.

	Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
	and mortal life shall cease,
	I shall possess within the veil,
	A life of joy and peace.

	When we've been there ten thousand years
	Bright shining as the sun,
	We've no less days to sing God's praise
	Than when we've first begun.

I stood in old Jerusalem, beside the temple there
I heard the children singing and ever as they sang
I thought the voice of Angels from Heaven in answer rang
I thought the voice of Angels from Heaven in answer rang

Jerusalem, Jerusalem
Lift up your gates and sing
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna to your King

And once again the scene was changed, new earth there seemed to be
I saw the Holy City beside the tideless sea
The light of God was on its streets, the gates were open wide
And all who would might enter and no one was denied

No need of moon or stars by night or sun to shine by day
It was the new Jerusalem that would not pass away
It was the new Jerusalem that would not pass away

Tell me what to say
Tell me how to show You how

How to please the angels

Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light

Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes; let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before.

Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before

I might overcome the anger, that I've learned to know
Find a peace of mind, I lost so long ago

And when it's scary
I won't look down
Are you watching me now? Watch closely now

And it's urging me, urging me, urging me on
Higher and harder and it's faster and farther
Than I've ever gone

When I feel like an eagle, my soul has no place on the ground
Born out of madness, I'll double the danger with no net at all
If you don't look away I'm secure, in the fact that you won't let me fall

Watch closely now, are you watching me now?

I'm the master magician, who'll help you escape
From the lies you've been told
When they're breaking your back, bring the last straw to me
I'll turn straw into gold

I break chains made of boredom that others have lived with for years
I leave good news on doorsteps and laughs where there used to be tears
I'm gonna need you later, when you're not around
But I can take it, yeah, I won't look down

Watch closely now, are you watching me now?
Watch me now, are you watching me now?
Are you watching me now",Finale,2018

Little squares where lovers love to go disappear
So parking lots can grow, why?

Making love's the thing that can't be seen, why?

Let your hair down just an inch or two
Let your skin be red or green or blue
They invent a special name for you, why?

On a clear day, oh say, can you see?
What remains of mountain greenery
Have your glimpse of all the scenery, sky

Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?

That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Michael Dease,"﻿첫 번째 앨범은 시큰둥
두 번째는 대중들의 작은 집중 뿐
세 네 번째 부터
이 썩은 scene의 귀중품
새빨간 19금 딱지가 붙었지만
still 진실만을 썼다
음악은 나의 길
심의실에서 평가 불능한 appeal
득과 실 벌써 decade
Still mic를 check 해
Like JK형 밝은 미래 in my arms
실낱 꿈 풍파와 입맞춤
가사를 쓸 때마다
혼자가 아니야 in my room
내게 숨 같던
친구들의 반이 하늘나라
내가 대신 꾸는 꿈 속에서
편히 잠을 자라
맺힌 내 땀을 봐라
I\'m a damn 괴물
Made an independent label
cause I won\'t ever settle
at your level

Till I see God up there
높이 솟아올라
세상은 유대자본이 지속한
몰락 속에 피로 차올라

처음엔 지루한
학창 시절을 열 창이었다
모든 게 좋아 고통은 먼 산이었다
부모는 답이 없다
친구는 관심 없다며
모두가 벽을 만들고서
난 남이었다
몇 해간 수돗물이 밥이라도
사방에 짙은 안개뿐인 반 지하도
견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어
잡초 같은 걸
아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼
산소 같은 걸
그냥 좀비처럼 걸어 세상을 얻다
모든 걸 고통 없이
원한다면 해답은 없다
내가 해냈으면 너도
충분히 할 수 있으니 believe

Never once did I stutter
한 계단씩 걸어
from the gutter to the top
Never 떨어
\'cause we hot like summer
서러웠던 날의 어깨의 먼지 털어
정승처럼 쓰면서 미친 개처럼 벌어
Like I\'m Lil Wayne
made a few milli still
I\'m insane in the brain
like I\'m Cypress Hill
Cypher\'s killed when I rap
얼굴 찌푸리면서
Like a drummer in the back
너넨 뒷북이나 쳐
마음이 뒤틀린
낙서 가득 기운이 앞서
누구나 깎아내는
조각가들 신물이 났어
차라리 신문이나 펴
요즘의 경제면처럼 마땅한
대안 없는 음악 믿음이 안 서
착실한 기반 닦은 확실한 상품
어설픈 화가들의 막 칠한 작품
둘 중 하나를 분명히 해
이력서를 써
결과야 뭐 어떻던 미련은 못써

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Michael Denner,"Down on his knees he sees the devil weeping/whinging his tongue
Mr. Cadillac doesn't even know he's been fighting his own
He's been trying shooting all the angels/devils inside
Playing around with the good and the evil in his mind
Alone in the desert and cold so cold

Driving back to the 10 house city something is wrong
He found the killer weapon in his car on the floor
Delusional the blood lost paint his mind in a cave
Feeding monsters in the back of his head
Killer, ripper, who are you
Take a look into the mirror then you will know
Heaven fire up my blood I'm waiting for something that's better

Welcome to a world of chaos, you've been caught in the light
Saw the door to the 10 house tale 7 shots in the night

Standing in the dark and shaking my own hand for a while
Saw the angel/devil vanished out in the light
Breathing new air for a day to begin
Soulless body with an empty shell
Killer, ripper, who are you
Take a look into the mirror then you will know
Heaven fire up my blood I'm waiting for something that's better

The price was high to pay and the memories are all crying like a child
A reason for all the blood that leaked, and a call up for the wild

There I'll keep you safe beside me
Come to my garden, rest there in my arms
There I'll see you safely grown

And on your way, stay here in the garden
As days grow long and mild
Come to the garden
Come, sweet child

Michael Doucet,"My history is no secret it's written in the stones
In the hill beside this river rest my mother's gentle bones
And daddy there beside her among his next of kin
And their legacy passed down to me the sons of mountain men

Raised to be a miner by a miners callused hands
Passed my youth between these mountains where I grew to understand
That family was the word of God and faith was it's demand
And life and death the same came from the coal beneath this land

Well, a rich man writes the book of laws a poor man must defend
But the highest laws are written on the hearts of honest men
If that cup is passed to me to do what must be done
When they lay me down remind them I was just my father's son

I've walked among these people, heard the stories that they tell
I've crawled beside them in the mines and touched the walls of hell
I've shared their sacred secrets, known their triumph and their pain
And right or wrong I'll stand with them on the final judgment day

They say God gives his comfort when the time of trouble comes
They say we'll know no share of peace till we lay down our guns
But will my boy have the chance to do the things I've never done
Or will he, like me, be told that he must be his father's son?

Well, a rich man writes the book of laws a poor man must defend
But the highest laws are written on the hearts of honest men
When that cup is passed to me to do what must be done
On a chunk of coal just carve these words, ""I was just my father's son""",My Father's Son,2013

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

Seas are drifting glass
The tides were turning to the storm
Winds were moving fast
Women waiting at the harbor
Silent stand around
Weather storms another day
For men the sea had found

Fisherman were laying nets
The barrels spread the bait
The sea gull's warning echoed 'round
Winds that wouldn't wait
People gathered at the harbor
Waiting for the tide
Eyes half closed against the spray
And tears they cannot hide

Shadows falling at the harbor
Women stand around
Weather storms another way
For men the sea had drowned

Hulls were creaking, crashing sails
Rains were slating down

Slanting, turning 'round
Thunder roaring at the harbor
Women drawn in fear
Huddle up to wait the time
And pray the sky will clear

Howling winds and the raging waves
Cracked upon the boats
And torn from safety, torn from life

Whispering of death
Women weeping holding hands
Of those they still have left

To find their fears allayed

For you to hold

Filled him with her light
And was consoled she was the moon
And he, the sun was gold

Eyes were blinded with his light
The sun she gave
Reflected back the night
The moon was waning
Almost out of sight

Softly, ocean gypsy calls
Silence holds the stars awhile
They smile sadly
For her where she falls

Just the time before the dawn
The sea is hushed
The ocean calls her
Day has taken her, and now she's gone

[Chorus]

No one noticed when she died
Ocean gypsy shackled to the tide
The ebbing waves were turning
Spreading wide

Something gone within her eyes
Her fingers lifeless stroke the sand
Her battered soul was lost
She was abandoned

Silken threads like wings still shine
Winds take pleasure, still make patterns
In her lovely hair
So dark and fine

Stands on high beneath the seas
Cries no more
Her tears have dried
Oceans weep for her, the ocean gypsy",Ocean Gypsy,1997

Nothing ever seems to last
I wonder if there was some ... something neglected ...
Something left unsaid, hasty words instead
Anything that could go wrong
It seems nothing was ever right
I'm haunted by lost chances past
I call to you in dreams at night
I'm fettered by our yesterday
Tomorrow is a bird in flight
I run to turn another page
And there you are within but out of sight
Our love, a bird in flight

I can never love again

I could have held my shattered dream
Seen all the things I should have seen

So much love now gone, just slipped away
So much pain to see that love betrays
I will never love again
For love lies and it will die in the end

I thought I saw love in his eyes
But now I know that love just lies
Leaving me hollow
Nothing to follow
So I will never give me heart
And I will always stand apart
Now I know love lies
Now I know love is bound to die

And love was nothing but a need
Devoured by an empty greed
The ashes fill my empty heart
I will always stand apart
This from love's beguiling mask
The kiss the questions never asked

Learn her freedom just inside a day
And find her soul
To find their fears allayed

Tried to make her love their own
They took her love they left her there
They gave her nothing back
That she would want to own

Gold and silver rings and stones
Dances slowly of the moon
No one else can know
She stands alone

Sleeping dreams will reach for her
She cannot say the words they need
She knows she's alone
And she is free

[Chorus:]
Ocean gypsy of the moon
The sun has made a thousand nights
For you to hold
Ocean gypsy, where are you
The shadows followed by the stars
Have turned to gold, turned to gold

Then she met a hollow soul
Filled him with her light
And was consoled she was the moon
And he, the sun was gold

Eyes were blinded with his light
The sun she gave
Reflected back the night
The moon was waning almost out of sight

Softly ocean gypsy calls
Silence holds the stars awhile
They smile sadly
For her where she falls

Just the time before the dawn
The sea is hushed
The ocean calls her
Day has taken her and now she's gone

[Chorus]

Noone noticed when she died
Ocean gypsy shackled to the tide
The ebbing waves were turning
Spreading wide

Something gone within her eyes
Her fingers, lifeless, stroke the sand
Her battered soul was lost
She was abandoned

Silken threads like wings still shine
Winds take pleasure still make patterns
In her lovely hair
So dark and fine

Stands on high beneath the seas
Cries no more
Her tears have dried
Oceans weep for her the ocean sighs

All the demons, all the devils of hell
On the other, the angels of glory

Under a misty moon
Under your skies of gray

In this life, you know
Storms are bound to come
Try not to worry about it
Sun's gonna shine again
Love won't leave you out in the rain

So walk that road
Remembering you're not alone
You got someone to lean on
Something to call your own

Just have a little faith and then
When all the clouds roll in
And you won't have to worry about it
Love's gonna shelter you
Love won't leave you out in the rain

Cause have a little faith and then
When all the clouds roll in
You won't have to worry about it
Love's gonna shelter you
Love won't leave you out in the rain

And when life seems to lose all rhythm
Love will show you how to dance
Given half a chance

And given time, in love you'll find
A peaceful place, a friendly place
A harbor on the sea of loneliness

Mark my words
Love's gonna cover you
And when you're stuck in the dead of night
Oh, love's gonna pull you through

And I'll be the one you know
Sayin', ""I told you so""
Life will be easier livin'
Once you begin to learn

Michael English,"The sky is full of stars tonight
But I need more than a fleeting light
To take me through the night
We've all got a song to sing
But I need more than melody
To reach me inside

Oh, I've danced alone
And I've tasted many tears
Now I long to find the love
That longs to hear

Save me, save me
I need Your love to rescue me
Save me, won't You save me?
Only Your love can set me free
Save me, save me
I need You to save me tonight

This world is made of yesterdays
All it gives it takes away
And leaves you in the rain
The fragile faith in what we see
Will merely be a memory
Like lightning when we turn away

Oh, I've loved and lost
And I've wasted many years
Oh, yeah but now I long for the love
That longs to reach me here

Save me, save me
I need Your love to rescue me
Save me, won't You save me?
Only Your love can set me free

You are the vine

Michael English,"I dreamed of a city called Glory,
So bright and so fair.
When I entered the gates I cried, ""Holy""
The angels all met me there:
They carried me from mansion to mansion,
And oh the sights I saw,
But I said, ""I want to see Jesus,
The One who died for all.""

Then I bowed on my knees and cried,
""Holy, Holy, Holy.""
I clapped my hands and sang, ""Glory,
Glory to the Son of God.""

As I entered the gates of that city,
My loved ones all knew me well.
They took me down the streets of Heaven;
Such scenes were too many to tell;
I saw Abraham, Jacob and Isaac
Talked with Mark, and Timothy
But I said, ""I want to see Jesus,
'Cause He's the One who died for me.""

Blessed by something I had done for them

Uneasy as I took their compliment

‘Cause I know the heart inside this man
I know the truth of who I am

The only thing that’s good in me is Jesus
I’ve lived long enough to know
No matter what this life may show
The only thing that’s good in me is Jesus

If you could walk the hallways of my heart
And see things as they really are
I wonder if you might be surprised

Seeing faded walls of pride and fear
Rooms I’ve filled with faithless tears
And corners where I’ve stood in compromise

Oh, but you’d see the work His grace has done
You’d know just how far I’ve come

As the lands from which they came
And though our words are all unique
Our hearts are still the same

Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

We teach the young our differences
Yet look how we're the same
We love to laugh, to dream our dreams
We know the sting of pain

From Leningrad to Lexington
The farmer loves his land
And daddies all get misty-eyed
To give their daughter's hand

Oh, maybe when we realize
How much there is to share
We'll find too much in common
To pretend it isn't there

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Though the rhetoric of government
May keep us worlds apart
There's no misinterpreting
The language of the heart

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart

And covers all the world

It's glory is supernal, supernal

There'll always be the love of God

It goes beneath the deepest stain
That sin could ever leave
Redeeming souls to live again
Who will on Christ believe, will believe

Oh, the love of God is greater far
Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star
And covers all the world

There'll always be the love Of God, precious love of God

And open the door

It?s all I care about
And I found
It?s all I hear about

I can?t figure out what
I wanna wait for
I forged all the answers
And now I want more
I won?t step back and watch

What I paid for
Wait until the mask?s off
And take it too far

It's all I care about
And I found
It's all I hear (I'm here?) about

Straight from the camera
In my heart
Forged all the answers
Right from the start
I haven?t got time

Michael Feinstein,"You were my adored one
Then you became the bored one
And I was like a toy that brought you joy one day
A broken toy that you preferred to throw away

If I expected love when first we kissed, blame it on my youth
If only just for you I did exist, blame it on my youth
I believed in everything like a child of three
You meant more than anything all the world to me

If you were on my mind all night and the day, blame it on my youth
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray, blame it on my youth
And if I cried a little bit when first I learned the truth
Don't blame it on my heart, blame it on my youth",Blame It on My Youth,1986
Michael Feinstein,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1986
Michael Feinstein,"Love is rare, life is strange
Nothing lasts, people change

Every time I lost another lover
I call up my old friend
And I say let's get together
I'm under the weather
Another love has come to an end

And she listens as I tell her my sad story
And wonders at my taste in friends
And we ponder why I do it
And the pain of getting through it
And she laughs and says, ""You'll do it again""

But we sit in a bar and talk till two
'Bout life and love as old friends do
And tell each other what we've been through
Our love is rare, life is strange
Nothing lasts, people change

And I ask her if her life is ever lonely
And if she ever feels despair
And she says she's learn to love it
Cause that's really all part of it
And it helps her feel the good time when they're there

Yes, we sit in a bar and talk till two
About life and love as old friends do
And tell each other what we've been through
Our love is rare, life is strange
Nothing lasts, people change

And we wander if I live with any lovers
Or spent my life alone
And the bartender is dozing
And it's getting time for closing
So we figured that I'll go out on my own

But we'll meet the year was '62
And travel the world as old friends do
And tell each other what we've been through
Our love is rare, life is strange
Nothing lasts, people change

Love is rare, life is strange
Nothing lasts, people change

How many, many times the worm had turned

When he said, ""The world was round""
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly

They told Marconi
Wireless was a phony
It's the same old cry

They laughed at me wantin' you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune

They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how
But ho, ho, ho
Who's got the last laugh now?

They all laughed at Rockefeller Center
Now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar

Ford and his Lizzie
Kept the laughers busy
That's how people are

They laughed at me wantin' you
Said it would be, 'Hello', 'Goodbye'
But oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie

They all said we'd never get together

For ho, ho, ho

",They All Laughed,1987

That will keep me loving you
And with your permission
May I list a few

The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No they can't take that away from me

We may never never meet again, on that bumpy road to love
But I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No they can't take that away from me

Better luck next time

Michael Feinstein,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

Unless I've come up with a new sensation
It could be that she's caught up with me
And all the mystery I'm speaking of
Is simply that I went and fell in love

Wonder why I haven't been the same
Since I first heard your name, I wonder why
And what's more, I do peculiar things
Like gaze at wedding rings, I wonder why

It's worth its heartache in ransom
And when that twilight steals
I know how the lady in the harbor feels

When I want rain, I get sunny weather
I'm just as blue as the sky
Since love is gone, can't get myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

Friends ask me out and I tell them I'm busy
Must get a new alibi
I stay at home and ask myself, ""Where is she?""
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops
Hanging on a stream of dreams
Fly little memories, my little memories
Remind her of our crazy schemes

Yes, somebody says, just forget about her
So I gave that treatment a try
And strangely enough I got along without her
Then one day she passed me right by, oh, well

I need more him, more him,
Cause his is the only music that makes me dance.

Michael Feinstein,"You coax the blues right out of the horn, Mame
You charm the husk right off of the corn, Mame
You've got the banjos strummin' and plunkin' out a tune to beat the band
The whole plantation's hummin' since you brought Dixie back to Dixieland.
You make our cotton easy to pick, Mame
You give my old mint julep a kick, Mame
You make the old magnolia tree blossom at the mention of your name.
You've made us feel alive again, you've given us the drive again
to make the South revive again, Mame.
You brought the cakewalk back into style, Mame
You make the weeping willow tree smile, Mame
Your skin is Dixie satin, there's rebel in your manner and your speech
You may be from Manhattan, but Georgia never had a sweeter peach.
You make our blackeyed peas and our grits, Mame
Seem like the bill of fare at the Ritz, Mame
You came, you saw, you conquered and absolutely nothing is the same.
Your special fascination'll prove to be inspirational, we think you're just sensational,

Michael Feinstein,"We all lose our way sometimes
Get caught out in the rain
Blue skies turn to grey sometimes
We've all heard that refrain

Who will take you as you are
You'll never need a lucky star
'Cause when someone's there who will listen
One who'll care and just love you

You'll make it through
And when there's a shoulder to cry on
Someone you can rely on
Be there too for that someone there for you

Everybody needs a friend

For you I sigh, just for you only,
Why haven't you seen it?

And wondering why, why it's me that you're wronging?
I tell you that I mean it
I'm all for you, body and soul!

I can't believe it, it's hard to conceive it
That you turn away romance
Are you pretending? Because it looks like the ending

And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

So carefree together

That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1995
Michael Feinstein,"For love alone, I did what otherwise I never could have done
Though if I lost a race or two, I should have won
And aimed a few too many arrows at the sun, it has been fun

When I was sure how very steep the price can be when love goes wrong
I held my hasty hardened check but not for long
Somehow I never could resist that siren song

If some dark day, I wake to find the love I felt was here to stay
Has slipped away
I'll simply say, these are the breaks, one makes mistakes

I bought the lies but now I'm wise
And from the ashes like the Phoenix I will rise
And sail the skies for nothing dies that flies for love alone

I see your face before me
Crowding my every dream
There is your face before me
You are my only theme

It doesn't matter where you are
I can see how fair you are
I close my eyes and there you are
Always

If you could share the magic
Yes, if you could see me too

But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.

Michael Feinstein,"You know I really can't recall the details
It's horrific how the memory fails
As it fades into a blow, I forget just how things were
My mind's become a wanderer

But wasn't there a smile once so remarkable
That's it's still on fire in my book of dreams
That pile of memories, all of you

But when I saw it then through
Why do I never find a clue
To why that kissing smile withdrew
Wasn't there a moment where I knew?

Wasn't there a time when life was beautiful?
Like a pantomime
When actors move sublimely sure of what they do
And my regrets are through

But there's one mystery I still pursue
When life was beautiful and blue
Wasn't there a moment?
I can't recall the moment

But wasn't there a moment
When you loved me too?

",Wasn't There a Moment,1995
Michael Feinstein,"I know a spot, peaceful and fair
I'd be so happy if I were there
No matter where I chance to be
Connecticut is the place for me

Miss every lake, miss every hill
Even in dreams, I think of them still
And when you see them, you'll agree
Connecticut is the place to be

Village dreams and childhood scenes
Are things that I remember yet
Land of dreams and moonlit streams
How close to heaven can you get

Nights full of stars, hearts full of joy
Paradise for a girl and a boy
I guess it suits me to a T
Connecticut is the place for me to be
Connecticut is the place for me

Sounds like a great stage for a late date
With a mate waiting just for you
And every Yale guy is a male guy
Through and through

Sounds like a great stage
It's never hum drum dating some chum
With her thumbs strumming a guitar
You'll find the chicks slicker and they mix quicker by far

Sounds like a great, great stage
It's quick and spanner then old Montana
And Indiana can't rate
The nights are longer, the men are stronger
So linger longer and wait
Cause it's a great, great, great, great stage

Circle the globe, dozens of times
Seen all its wonders and I've known all its qualms
I've searched it with a fine tooth comb
And found that I have only one home sweet home
Connecticut always will be my home sweet home",Connecticut,1995

Birthday, November 26
Athena Malvain, Aquarius
We two will never mix

Sagittarians are fickle, untrue
Up to, typical, masculine tricks
Aquarians are constant, like you
So, we're in an awful fix

I have the Sun and Saturn
You have the moon in your arms
Beware, this ill starred pattern
I'll forget you if I'm wise

But a man in love is never wise
Sometimes he even defies the skies

Love can change the stars
Whenever it's strong enough
Believe in it long enough
It will happen, somehow

Rearrange the stars
Love gives us the power for it
Remember the hour for it, is now

So, darling, even when we're apart
Take my hand in your arm
Keep me locked in your heart
And I won't be alone

Soon, we'll kiss and stars will fade in the mist, for me
They'll only exist for me
If they shine in your arms

When two hearts are entwined
Venus waltz's with Mars
Hand in hand, we will find
Love can change the stars

""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings

There's a big affair awaiting you and me
Something in the weather caused you every heart

When you could be learning the steps of gladness.

Shoes! Go on and carry me there!

Helps a bit; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul

Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.

You're sure to win out.

Our feet can learn to dance
Whatever stone life may sling

So easy to idolize

So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

And cause each other pain

How we take each other's love
Without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back
Forgetting to remember
Just forgetting and no thank you
Isn't it a pity

Some things take so long
But how do i explain
Why not too many people can see
That we are all just the same
We're all guilty

Just take it for granted
Without thinking anymore
We give each other pain
And we shut every door

We take each other's minds
And we're capable of take each other's souls
We do it every day
Just to reach some financial goal
Lord, isn't it a pity, my God
Isn't it a pity, my God
And so unnecessary

Just a little time, a little care
A little note written in the air
Just the little thank you

Michael Feinstein,"Love is rare, life is strange
Nothing lasts, people change

Every time I lost another lover
I call up my old friend
And I say let's get together
I'm under the weather
Another love has come to an end

And she listens as I tell her my sad story
And wonders at my taste in friends
And we ponder why I do it
And the pain of getting through it
And she laughs and says, ""You'll do it again""

But we sit in a bar and talk till two
'Bout life and love as old friends do
And tell each other what we've been through
Our love is rare, life is strange
Nothing lasts, people change

And I ask her if her life is ever lonely
And if she ever feels despair
And she says she's learn to love it
'Cause that's really all part of it
And it helps her feel the good time when they're there

Yes, we sit in a bar and talk till two
About life and love as old friends do
And tell each other what we've been through
Our love is rare, life is strange
Nothing lasts, people change

And we wander if I live with any lovers
Or spent my life alone
And the bartender is dozing
And it's getting time for closing
So we figured that I'll go out on my own

But we'll meet the year was '62
And travel the world as old friends do
And tell each other what we've been through
Our love is rare, life is strange
Nothing lasts, people change

Love is rare, life is strange
Nothing lasts, people change

Michael Feinstein,"Today I may not have a thing at all
Except for just a dream or two
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

Right now it may not seem like spring at all
We're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

As long as I've got arms that cling at all
It's you that I'll be clinging to
And all the dreams I dream, beg or borrow
On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true
And all my bright tomorrows belong to you

When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he love you all the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes if it's real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless they need you all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way

Who knows where the road will lead us

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds come along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse
The chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, darling, I love you

Still I am sure that the answer gonna come somehow

A lump comes to my throat

To wrestle with a goat
His blood-stained coat is tribute to
His final sacrifice
His body may be past its peak
But his soul's in paradise

Michael Flores,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

She stopped in for a spell
I found the true
Like she had always knew

She visits me
On Sunday afternoon
A firmament
I welcome to this room

Sister dressed in mourning hue
Fall to me sent of better rooms
Leave me in water colored plumes
And melodies
Traces of a girl that I once knew

In evening now
She shadowed in the grey
Her covenant
To slowly slip away

Fall to me sent of better rooms
Leave me in water colored plumes
And melodies
Traces of a girl that I once knew",Sister,2014

Little coquette, making fun of the one who loves you
Breaking hearts you are ruling
Little coquette, true hearts tenderly dreaming of you.

And when you are alone with all your regrets,

On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more

It was midnight Come to think of it
It was spring
There was music I was listening
Then in the room somewhere someone began to sing 
This serenade made for remembering
 
A small cafe, Mam'selle
Our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet 
And so were you, Mam'selle
And as the night danced by 
A kiss became a sigh
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle 
Just like wine does
No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you
And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry 
And so will I, Mam'selle

I dreamed I held you in my arms
But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I hung my head and I cried.

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy,
If you will only say the same.
But if you leave me and love another,
You'll regret it all some day:

You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you

You told me once, dear, you really loved me
And no one else could come between.
But not you've left me and love another;
You have shattered all of my dreams:

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me
When I awake my poor heart pains.
So when you come back and make me happy
I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame.

In her prison of wishes

We love and we fight but it's all day for night just a masquerade
We'll read till the red light is off then we go take our faces off
Like two clowns in a side show

Michael Franks,"Money misery grows
Oh woe is we
Who know where it will end
Hard luck follows us
Minus never plus
Will we break or just bend
Never say die
We've got the worst behind us
If we just try
Soon we'll be feeling strong
Cancel that frown
Somehow the light will find us
Can't keep us down
Well at least not for long
Worry's worn us thin
But when our ship comes in
All our troubles will fold
We're a perfect fit
Come to think of it
Love's more precious than gold
",Never Say Die,1983
Michael Franks,"Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray

Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I pray 
I could breakaway

I'll spread my wings, and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk 
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway

Want to feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get on board a fast train
Travel on a jet plane
Faraway
And breakaway

I'll spread my wings, and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging 'round revolvin' doors
Maybe I don't know where they take me
But gotta keep movin' on
Movin' on
Fly away
Breakaway

I'll spread my wings, and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Michael Franks,"Here we are again
That fatal combination
I guess it's opposite attraction
It's gone too far again
This crazy conversation
It's like a nuclear reaction
Lady your lip service has no rival
Don't you know deception is uncouth?
Didn't you read somewhere in the Bible
Not to bend the truth?
If you think your lip service will amaze me
You're utterly confused - that much is clear
'Cause baby your lip service doesn't faze me
It's so insincere
It's only lip service
It's nothin' but lip service
There you are again
Unable to conceal it
That hourglass configuration
It's gone too far again
Believe me, I can feel it
I can't resist that old temptation
Lady your lip service can be vicious
Don't you know deception is uncouth?
However your lips look so delicious
While they bend the truth
Give me some lip service, just attack me
I know I have asked you to be real
But sometimes your lip service is exactly
What I want to feel
Tired of of truces
Eloquence is useless
Eighty-six it
'Cause all this talk won't fix it
",Lip Service,1987
Michael Franks,"Lovers from Shakespeare come to mind
The ""parting is such sweet""
""Wherefore art thou"" kind
Shattered illusions, sad conclusions
When I think of us
Love called the shots and we believed
We gave new meaning to the word ""naive""
Can't comprehend the logic of love
When I think of us
How it exploded I don't know
Right out of nowhere
We ran out of mistletoe
Still I remember only good times
When I think of us
We were young and our hearts were broken when love was lost
The pain we concealed
Somehow time has healed
We tried hard but I
Guess we failed the test
Does it matter why?
Just remember I
Hope you're happy I
Wish you all the best
Who could predict the end of spring?
We were in love and love was everything
Promises broken, cruel words spoken
When I think of us
How it exploded I can't say
Right out of nowhere
The rain washed it all away
Still I remember only good times
When I think of us
We were young and our hearts were broken when love was lost

Boom Skwad in the house

I lower da boom when I do the cypher dance
With naps and saggy pants as I romance the plants
I take puffs on stuff, rough enough to give a buzz
To my 'cause, even though he don't touch the stuff
See this blunt in my front, some say might stink
But yo the skunk helps me think
I'm a boom smoker joker with the knack because I'm gifted
Some say misfit, but fuck it let's get lifted
I get a box of 50, get nifty with a spliff G
And tick tackle new jacks who tried to diss me
I walk through the rain for dimes at the sess spot
Not hot with cops, cause I'd hate to get popped
I'm a terror to a trey bag, son you'll soon see
But I gots to get, higher, lower the boom G

Lower da boom, you got to lower da boom
Where the brothers puff the ism and the smoke clouds the room
Spark that blunt, represent don't front
We got what you want, it's the indo funk

Ahh, I just catch the fumes
I consume, bend the room, with the ? tune
Spark another L for the cypher
Sit back and light the, five inch adventure that's alrighta
Lower the boom, for the sess bags thicker
One's a flight to Phillie, while the other one's the liquor
Off to the weed spot, the bags better be fat
Or else you catch the speed knot, and holmes you don't need that
Spark the indo or the L, sniff the weed
But I never get splits mista cause Tame's been hip ta
The baby of the blunts, so I'm down to catch the contact
Here's the rap chat, it's a fact that I react
Smooth from the boom consumed a zoom zoom a zoomin
MC El the leaner cleaner thoughts dials tune-in
Into, the matter roll the blunt bunt batter
Pass the shit quick, don't flip, with the chit chatter
I never puckered once, my lungs got jammed
My man said it wouldn't kill, but I choke, god damn
The sess starts to cloud the room
The Artifacts, commences ta, lower the boom

Lower da boom, you got to lower da boom
Where the brothers puff the ism and the smoke clouds the room
Spark that blunt, represent don't front
We got what you want, it's the indo funk

Ohh I hope I live to see the day they make it legal
To all the people can't see what I'm smokin ain't evil
Stop callin me a pusher cause I take pulls and take tokes
Cut snakes, cut breaks, and I hate fake folks
So pass the cheeba senorita cause I need a
Fat fuckin Phillie just before I funk a freaker
Creatin from the milk crate with hooks and riffs
I can lift em, and shift em makin jams like this
With the blunt in my left hand and the Phillie in my pocket
MC El, at my right, with the mic so I can rock it
Sess makes my eyes red, but shades only cost three bills
In Hooterville, so I'm chill
See the bigger the blunt, is how I feel about my indo
Because my moms would never throw my shit out the window
I puff herb til noon, chill and watch cartoons
Yes once again, I lowered the boom

Are you weeded?  Nope see, I'm doper for the session
Catchin wreck, check the tec, cause I'm sober for the sketch
If I'm caught smokin blunts, I catch a bad one from my clan see
I'm higher than a messiah so you know I'm handy dandy
Legalize it holmes cause the zone's gettin bigger
From the whites, to the Ricans, cause they learned it from the niggaz
So who's the first to kick it real, for the, cypher
Eight Phillies so you know you gots to pass the other lighter
Pass the incense gents, it smells out in the hall
My groupies think I'm stunnin cause I'm six feet tall
No need for the sheepa cheeba cleaner than, Beaver Cleaver
Though I'm down to pitch, with my skit like Tom Seaver
Either, or my jaw speak of true features
I must be, the freaker of this doper class teacher
So pass the Visine, so you can keep your eyes clean
Look to Looney Tunes, we lowered, the boom

We're safe inside this agile blue lagoon

I want to know you bird of paradise
I want to show you of the love that I feel
I need to touch you bird of paradise
I need your touch to make this fantasy real

And the ship like so many toys fear the wind and fight the waves
In your arms it's a forgotten dream, nothing more

To be together

I need the heat

Sometimes a cloud
Sails along harmlessly

Just lovers in Paris as common as doves

Sharing a warm baguette
Coffee with anisette
We kissed in the Metro

And it always reminds me of you
And happily now all these many years hence
You are still by my side, Samba Blue

with my heart pumpin' on
like a bubblin' dub track
like a garlicy hot tonque and lip smack

I did some contemplation
before we got down to this consecration
maybe baby something in you kiss said
it was an impetous 
for me to rethink this

If I love you
then I better get tested
make sure we're protected

dressed like a question mark

I hear my memory bark
in the back of my brain,
makn' me insane...

Is it gonna be a negative?
How'm I gonna live my life if I'm positive?
Is it gonna be a negative?
but how'm I gonna live my life if I'm positive?

It dawned on me, it seemed to me
this is unusual scenery
this red light greenery
make me feel kinda dreamery
thinkin' how I used to be

Arrive at the clinic
walk through the front door
take a nervous number
then I think about it more
about all the time
that I neglected
makin sure that
I was protected

They took my blood 
With an anonymous number
two weeks waitin' wonderin'

I shoulda done this a long time ago
a lot of excuses why I couldn't go
I know these things and these things I must know
'cause it's better to know than to not know!

(chorus)

I go home to kick it
in my apartment
I try to give myself
a risk assessment
the wait is what can really annoy ya
everyday is more paranoya

I'm readin' about how it's transmitted
some behavior I must admit it
who I slept with, who they slept with,
who they, who they, who they slept with

I think about life and immortality
what's the first thing I do if I'm H.I.V
have a cry and tell my mother
get on the phone and call my past lovers
I never thought about infectin' anotha
all the times that I said ""Hmmm? Don't bother.""

Was it really all that magic?
The times I didn't use a prophalactic

Would my whole life have to change?
or would my whole life remain the same?
sometimes it makes me want to shout!
all these things too hard to think about
a day to laugh, a day to cry
a day to live and a day to die
'til I find out, I may wonder
but I'm not gonna live my life six feet under

(chorus)",Positive,1994
Michael Franti,"[Chorus]
Sometimes, I feel like I can do anything and
Sometimes, I'm so alive
Sometimes, I feel like I can zoom cross the sky and,
Sometimes, I want to cry 

Most people try to aim to please
But a lot a them are kinda weak in the knees
Learnin' late about the birds and the bees
Falllin' in love and want to bee set free
Playin' ball at the age of thirteen
Everybody's growin up with a dream
I never noticed what could happen to me
Time flies when you're walkin' the streets
One minute gotcha holdin' an ace
The next minute gotcha fall on yer face
A mean city is a nasty place
Only a rat can win a rat race!
Peace to the people who be fallin' away
To make it home today
And peace to the people who be tryin' to find
Som kinda life

Sound body and sound of mind
Sound of the rhythm and sound of the rhyme
Somebody marchin' all out of time
Biggest mistakes are the humanest kind
Judge not, lest you be judged

Blood bubblin' thicker than mud
The heart beat rub-a-dub-dub
Show love and love who you know
Family wherever you go

Bravissimo, magnifico
Peace to the people who be losing their head
Peace to the people who be needin' a bed

Love to the people who be feelin' alone
Spreadin' love upon the microphone
Hope to the people who be feelin' down

Ain't it fine like sippin' sweet Georgie wine
See I'm just chillin' with these friends of mine

I ain't tryin' a bother you
So why ya gotta bother me
What goes on in your bedroom ain't no mess to me
You say your God don't like my God
'cause you don't like my friends

No matter where I roam
Whoa-oh I know every single soul is poem
Written on the back of God's hand

Ya see Moms and Pops be copulatin'
Plantin' seeds and pickin' weeds for another season
Another reason for livin' another reason for givin'
Another reason for lovin' and tryin' stay out of prison
'cause everything in life can't be nice and
Everything you want can't be got
But the lessons on patient be causing the pressure to rise
And make some people suicidal
Oh no! another soul, has lost control
We pull him back into the fold
He got strung out on the material
All the superficial initials upon his clothes
They make me wanna go Sprewell
Every time I see my family locked in jail
Uh-huh, the economical can be demonical
Keep love in your soul

[Chorus]

Ya see people are so beautiful in love
That's why I'm reminded of life's precious moments every time
I see lovers walkin' by in the park
Close my eyes and I stop reminisce
To see a little baby suckin' on his mama's
Milk-ey silky smoothness of a lovin' caress holdin' baby to breast
And blessin' the world with another to test, test, test
Oh-yes, oh-yes Bom-bom!
I'd like to sing a little song
Dedicated to the people who would like to sing along
'cause every little song has little beats and notes
Like every little lake has little trees and boats
All people deserve a safe and warm home
'cause every single soul is a poem

[Chorus]

Right from the start in a world torn apart
A baby's love leaves finger prints upon the heart
So many think it, but never say it
""why bring a child to this planet full of hatred?""
They might not make it like the youngest departed
Or worst of all they might become a part of it
Involved in it, perpetuating violence, violence
And growing up in silence
Seein' things they don't know how to deal with
And learnin' ways, to try to cope with it
Cope with it, cope with it
And not lose hope

Michael Franti,"Six foot six above sea level
I grab the mic because I take you to
Another mental level
Low power frequency radio modulation

The big sound from the underground another pirate radio station
We bring the truth to places truth is never heard before
We bring the sound communication of our tribal war
Dark vision fly by helicopters in the night
Attempt triangulation of our station in the fight

Straight from the bass the deep down low precision
High crime treason we broadcastin' sedission
Like the wall street mornin' afternoon edition
Commandeering airwaves from unknown positions

Live and direct we comin' never pre-recorded
With information that will never be reported
Disregard the mainstream media distorted
Whoop! whoop!
We comin' listener supported

Don't take no prisoners if can't afford to feed none
Don't start no fights if you can't predict the outcome
Don't make donations where you cannot get your dough back
Fuck the apathetic bullshittas send em' all your prozac

I will not climb into your telephone tree
And ""hell no you can't put me on hold!""
It's the same recorded message you'd been singin' all along
Keep handin' us the bible while you walkin' off with all the gold

The bureaucratic office sends you merry-go-rounding
While the KKK police the streets by blood hounding
Interest on the credit card just keeps on compounding
But the FCC can neva shut this pirate sound down

But it ain't easy
Doin' hard time
For somebody else's crime

Hate is what got me here
But I know that love sweet love is gonna set me free
All the hatred in the world is what got me here today
But I know that love is gonna set me free

Man I been away for so long now
I ain't seen no daylight for God knows how long now
I come out fightin' when I hear that bell ring

Wash away my pain
Love like a hurricane

But like gasoline you can tell I'm in the tank
Like money in the bank
I smell appealing, but I'm toxic, can send ya reeling
Without an inklin', keep ya thinkin'
'cause you gave cash to the feds, left your school district for dead
Fucked you up in the head, but still they sayin' nothin's wrong
Sellin' firewater but outlawing the bong
Still believing the system is workin'
While half of my people are still outta workin'
Anonymous notes left in the pockets and coats
Of judges and juries from 'Frisco to Jersey
Threats and protests politicians mob debts
Trumped up charges and phoney arrests
Stage a lethal injection, the night before the election
'cause he got donations from the prison guard's union

Listen in to my stethoscope on a rope
International lullabies, human cries
Thumps and silence, the language of violence
Algorithmic, cataclysmic, seismic, biorhythmic
You can make a life longer, but you can't save it
You can make a clone an then you try to enslave it?
Stealin' DNA samples from the onborn
And then you comin' after us
'cause we sampled a James Brown horn?
Scientists who's God is progress
A four-headed sheep is their latest project
The CIA runnin' like that Jones from Indiana
But they still won't talk about that (Jim) Jones 
(People's Temple mass suicide) in Guyana

No one slips on bananas
Do you really think that that car killed Diana
Hell I shot Ronald Reagan, I shot JFK,
I slept with Marilyn (Monroe) she sung me happy birthday

Well politicians got lipstick on the collar
The whole media started to holler
But I don't give a fuck who they screwin' in private
I want to know who they screwin' in public
Robbin', cheatin', stealin'
White collar criminal
McDonald eatin', you deserve a beatin'
Send you home a weepin', with a fat bill for your
Caribbean weekend
For just about anything they can bust us
False advertising sayin' ""halls of Justice''
You tellin' the youth don't be so violent
Then you drop bombs on every single continent
Mandatory minimum sentencin'
'cause he got caught with a pocket fulla medicine
Do that again another ten up in the pen

Michael Franti,"We livin' in a mean time and an aggressive time
A painful time, a time where cynicism rots to the vine
In a time where violence blocks the summer shine
Lifetimes, go by in a flash
In search for love, in search for cash
Everybody want to be some fat tycoon
Everybody want to be on a tropic honeymoon
Nobody want to sing a little bit out of tune
Or be the backbone of a rebel platoon
It's too soon to step out of line
You might get laughed at you might get fined
But do you feel me when I say I feel pain everyday
When I see the way my friends gotta slave
And never get ahead of bills they gotta pay
No way no way!
Some make a living doing killing Colombian penicillin
Some are willing to play the villain they just chillin'
To pass the time, pass the information
Or pass the wine
Pass the buck or pass the baton
But you can't pass the police or the pentagon
The I.R.S. or the upper echelon
I think it's time to make a move on the contradiction 

[Chorus]
Bom-Bom, rock the nation
Take over television and radio station

Bom-Bom the truth shall come
Give the corporation some complication! 

This is the dawning of our time I say it one more time
To emphasize the meaning of my rhyme
To rise above all the dirt and grime
Add the right spice at the right time
Fuck the constitution
Are we part of the solution or are we part of the pollution
Sittin' by and wonderin' why,
Things ain't the way we like to find them to be, to be
For you and for me the people over there and the ones in between
Check our habitation are we a peace lovin' nation
Peace lovin' nation
I have a reasonable doubt I think I'll just spell it out
There's no need to scream or to shout
The N.R.A. just bought a man's soul
Then he jumps up and shouts gun control
The government says that killing's a sin
Unless you kill a murderer with a lethal syringe
So I ask again ""are we peace lover's then""
Some of them slang guns when they six years old
Some of them end up in some six foot hole
This whole damn place seems to, lost control
So I raise my voice before I lose my soul

[Chorus]

This is the way I'll express my feelings
Vibe revealed and revolved spinning on a record y'all
Try to confiscate take what I communicate with
It's ancient gift of the lip steady creating
Activating passing vocal vibrations to the blind plus the seeing
Human doesn't mean just being
Be coming don't believe it just belife it
Belongings or beloved rehearse it or recite it
While shining drop your guns and move your tongues
Battle motivation in no time lyrics come
Sometimes fun others run their mouth or away
My mind co beaming like an early sun ray
One day we'll get the picture and all combine
Less the talking bout mines is mine and become one mind
Every piece of the puzzle has its place
To build the piece of the puzzle called the human race 

Taking it long enough we crush the formal journalistic
Dyslexic critters talk backwards to rap words
I'm sure raising my hands with questions and demands
Statements and a plan with a map of the land

[Chorus]",Rock the Nation,2001
Michael Franti,"I was born botanical
The soul of an animal
Deep beneath the layers, I sink my roots
No need for mechanical
I come strictly organical
When I need to feast, I look to the East
That's why I'm never scared of the beast
Even though they try to prey upon me
I'm protected by the one always greater than me
So now I reveal to thee
Because you wanna see
The contour of my mystery
The strength of my arches
The colour of my conscience
And the way that I process my diction
Some fact some diction some mystery
Some future fantasy
I'm the trunk that holds the branches
The leaves who do the dances
My flowers romantic
My love gigantic
From Africa, transplanted translantic
In the heat of the sun
I bring shade for everyone
Like the beat on the one
I'm the skin on the drum

I keep on living with the fullness of the one
Like the heat of the sun or the skin on the drum

I'm fully marinated and now I'm ready for the fire
So you can fire one
Fire one
Fire two

See I've been fully marinated
And now I'm ready for the fire
See I'm beginning to perspire
From deep within to the skin
Yo, the feminine and the masculine
The pieces of the puzzle
See my reflections in the puddle
After the storm the purple of the sky
Brings to mind another time
When we resided
Below the water line
Life was fine there human divine
But in the years following
Evil men came swallowing
Everything in sight
Some learned to run, some stayed to fight
I kneeled at the tomb of the soldier
Said I would love to behold her
The magic in store there
She touched me on the shoulder
She said, ""in time all is revealed, box of light be unsealed
Now listen to me son, be like the skin on the drum""

And as the pepper gas clears
And police and protestors go home
Just as the morning dew are tear drops of the night

And will never leave you dry

Michael Franti,"The world around gotcha down
You got high blood pressure, people pushing you around
And some wanna tell you how you should behave
Cut your hair the right way, tell you what to say,
Hang out with the right folks, become a fashion slave

But do you wanna feel free (and I say it again now)
But do you wanna feel freaky and free
But do you wanna feel free (I don't care where you come from)
Do you wanna feel free, free, free, free, freaky and free

Unwind your mind

Take your time (go on, take it)
Unwind your mind

Hard livin' in the city
You find a diamond in the sewer but the gas bills rise
But I got to say to them, ""what's it all mean?""
You gotta take a loan
To pay the bill on the phone
Educated, graduated but you can't get a job

But do you wanna feel free (and I say it again now)

Michael Franti,"You don't have to be so scared to share what's inside
'cause you're Daddy's little superstar
And you're Mama's little butterfly
Fly high

A strange strange litany of verses and reverses
Adlibs and rehearses
Clouds burst and words cursed
An argument breaks out
It's one we've all heard before, it's boring
Had us all snoring from the first line
One after another chimed in perfect time
Tired rehashes of petty cashes and mismatches
You shoulda coulda's
And ""why didn't 'tcha dida's""
Crippling snippets aimed at the heart
To inflame and impart blame
Framed like Mumia
Verbal diarrhea
Creating chasms between the souls of two
Or two billion
Nations torn apart
Station to station damnation
With much deliberation and very little consideration
To the return on the damage from the altercation
Collateral condemnation
Then denyin' like colorization of an old black and white
Create a revision of the recent last night
The fight that started with two words, ""I'm right""

[Chorus]
You don't have to be so scared to share what's inside
'cause you're Daddy's little superstar
And you're Mama's little butterfly
Fly high

But of course the fight ends with no resolution
Merely a vow for retribution, substitution, execution, electrocution
Ruthless, toothless and truthless
Mumbling through page after page of excuses
Abuses of the gift of the gab
Gabriel the trumpeter
Bestowed upon us a voice with a choice
And a tongue kept moist by years of salivating
For oysters, pearls and aphrodisiacs
Locked in an ugly shell always too chewy and gooey
So they get swallowed whole
But a tongue is so much more than a vehicle for greed
A tongue is for washing fur
Or for licking wounds
Or for welcoming newcomers into a room
Or cleansing those fresh from the womb
Without a tongue there would be no croons
Swoons, Junes under the moon
No bees pollinating no flowers in bloom
No recitation of words at the foot of a tomb
Or wills read aloud of the family heirlooms
You probably couldn't even blow up a balloon
And that would be a shame
Because to exhales the name of the game
Exhale from the heart
Not from the lungs
Exhale from the heart
Not from the tongue

[Chorus]

Listening is understanding
And finding compassion
Love is the action of soul satisfaction
A tongue can make wishes and also fine kisses
Taste a sweet cake and also cast disses
But nothing compares to the voice from within
Without it we might just be mannequins
Up to no darn good shenanigans
Learn to be skilful movers of the stones
That block the heart and turn humans to clones
Learn to forgive, set free the bones
Touch with your flesh, take off the rubber gloves
Love like your life depends on it
Because it does

Bringin' flowers to a grave in the middle
Of the city isolation is a riddle
To be surrounded by a million other people
But to feel alone like a tree in a desert
Dried up like the skin of a lizard
But full of color like the spots of a leopard
Drum and bass pull me in like a shepherd
Scratch my itch like a needle on a record
Full of life like a man gone to Mecca
Sky high like an eagle up soaring
I speak low but I'm like a lion roaring
Baritone like a Robeson recordin'

Hold your breath and your underwater breathin'

To be rhymin' without a real reason
Is to claim but not to practice a religion
If television is the drug of the nation
Satellite is immaculate reception
Beaming in they can look and they can listen

To legalize you or give you your freedom
You want rights ask em', they'll read em'

In time we find that we can open
Up a heart that's locked or been broken
By the pain of words not spoken
Or shot by guns a still smokin'
Cartwrights out on the Ponderosa
Or drive by bang in Testarossa
We need to heed the words of Dalai Lama

Help my soul break down them walls

The subtle positives that you had on me
Came about like a renaissance
Like a little happy dance, got into my feet

Led you to your hard luck blues

Everyone deserves music, sweet music

Seven in the morn' step on the floor
Walk into the kitchen and you open the door
There ain't much left in the bottle of juice
Because the seeds that you planted never reproduced
Computer still runnin'
But your mind has crashed
Because the plans that you made never came to pass
Now you reconizin' the times is hard
When you tryin' to take a bite out of your ATM card

He just like to sit and drink alone
Mama always tried to do the best she could
She would work all day and then come home to cook but,
We all vain, we all strange
We all drained, we all love to just complain.

We got blame, we all a little bit insane

Michael Franti,"Don't fear your best friends, 
Because a best friend would never try to do you wrong.
And don't fear your worst friends, 
Because a worst friend is just a best friend that's done you wrong.
And don't fear the night time, 
Because the monsters know you're divine.
And don't fear the sunshine, 
Because everything is better in the summertime.

But it's never too late to start the day over, 
It's never to late to pick up the phone.
You know it's never too late to lay your head down on my shoulders, 
It's never too late just come on home.

Don't fear the water, 
Because you can swim inside you within your skin.
And don't fear your father,
Because a father's just a boy without a friend.
And don't fear to walk slow, 
Don't be a horse race, be a marathon.
And don't fear the long road, 
Because on the long road you got a long time to sing a simple song.

But it's never too late to start the day over, 
It's never too late to pick up the phone.
You know it's never too late to lay your head down on my shoulders, 
It's never too late just come on home.

Don't fear your teachers, 
Because if you listen you can hear music in a school bell.
And don't fear your preacher, 
If you can't find heaven in a prison cell.
And don't fear your own self, 
Paying money to justify your worth.
And don't fear your family, 
Because you chose them along time before your birth.

But it's never too late to start the day over, 
It's never too late to pick up the phone.
You know it's never too late to lay your head down on my shoulders, 
It's never too late just come on home.

Michael Franti,"Why must I feel like this today 
I'm a soldier but afraid sometimes 
To face the things that may 
Block the sun from shinin' rays 
And fill my life with shades of grey 
But still I long to find a way 
So today I pray for grace 

I take a moment to myself 
So I can myself 
To feel myself 
And be real myself 
Life's addictions and afflictions 
'Cause abrasions from their friction 
Sometimes, it's easier to live in fiction 
I can run, but I can't hide 
From the pains that 
Reside deep down inside 
There is no pill 
That can be swallowed 
There is no guru 
That can be followed 
There's no escapin' 
From my own history 
Those that I hurt
And those that hurt me 
I was dead for a million years 
'Fore I was born and 
I'll be dead for a million more 
After I'm gone 
So I live, to give somethin' 
That can live on 
Like the way you hum a song when the music's gone 
Like the warmth on the sand 
When the sun goes down 
And I'm sittin' with myself 
Nobody else is around but

[Chorus:]

Been a long, long time 
Since I been away 
Been a long, long time 
Since I felt this way 
Been a long, long time 
I found the words to say 
How much I'm grateful 
For my life today 
'Cause under every cup 
You might find a nut 
Behind every corner 
You might get jacked up 
At the end of every rainbow
You might find gold 
The last bite of your sandwich
Hope you don't find mold 
'Cause none of us 
Can live the perfect life 
The kind that we see on nick at night 
And sometimes, we all 
Just lose sight 
Of the pain that will guide us 
From dark into the light 
We fall down yes, but we get up
And sometimes we just need 
A little bit of love 
To help make it 
Through another day 
Into the night, into the light
Into a Saturday 
So in the morning when I'm waitin' 
For the sun to raise 
And my head's a little foggy 
Like I'm in a haze 
I remind myself that 
Everything is gonna be okay 
I take a breath, slow down and say...

Where, when, Mr. President, ""What do you know?""
It's evident settin' in slow, ""How does it go?""

The devil can't stop, won't stop blockin' the globe
Fall in a cell here
Freedom come knockin' at the door

They try lockin' it though, but we about to explode
We got the firefly, tiger eye apocalypse flow
So deep in the bottom of your bottomless soul
Send mind darts flyin' out, without a pistol

Redesign lost minds got outta the cold
Bring order to a world that is outta control
""Truth"" you say, I say, ""How do I know?""

I wanna rock with heads because I love hip hop
I wanna rock my beats all around the block

Spread my limbs out wide and pull love so close to me and

If were the fruits, you'd make the sweetest cherry pie from me and
If I could be the night, my moon replace all electric lights and
Magic music would transmit from outer space on satellites
If I myself could be the ocean, you would feel emotion all the time and
If I were the words, then everything that everybody said would rhyme

I'd be in the lives of all who connect

Pores would be dripping pure hot intellect and
The minds of the masses would all stay erect and
Then just for kicks, I'd mail out some checks
Addressed to those who sent their used latex in
Yes, that's what I would if I were sex

I could be you, you could be me
I could walk a mile in your shoes.....

Well, language are your tears, are your tears

What I got to say right now is love enough yeah?
Love enough yeah? Love enough?

It goes on and on and on and on and on
For a 1000 years I say
And it goes on and on and on and on and on
Well, language are your tears, are your tears

Gentleman

What Mother Nature gives
Mankind refuse to let live
Taking the universe in their own hand

Oh yes now, start targeting the deposities
Charging the negative
Causing the most unusual circumstances

Everyday we rise back
I love to fights like again
Hoping that's our hearts
Where we see sleep our love tonight

Blessed words we speak again
Of the words to do my friend
For us to live in this dark garden
Of Eden

So tell me is your love enough? Yeah
Your love enough? Yeah
Is your love enough?

Can you love some more ?
Is your love enough? Yeah
Is your love enough? Yeah
Is your love enough?
Oh tell me, tell me, tell me

What language do you laugh in?
What language do you cry in?
What language do you dance in
Make romance in

What language do you make love in?
Oh, pray to above him
What language are your fears?
What language are your tears?

Believe in God's existence

Michael Franti,"A child is born, and a mama's torn 
About the life that it's bound to live 
A sun and moon and a modest home 
Is all they asking the Lord to give 
But politics and big events they never seem to notice the little guy 
So make a plan or simply hold a hand but don't ever be a passer by 

Tolerance or violence and the whole world go to war 
Is one enough or is one too many 
Before we say, ""No More"" 
Could you ever love a pot of gold? 
Could you ever love another lonely soul? 
Could you ever find a love that was oceans wide? 
Could you ever find love in another stranger's eyes? 

Oh, give a little, 
Tolerance, tolerance 
We need you more and more 
So lend a hand or simply hold a friend 
That's in need of a life support 
Draw a picture, share a whisper 
Anyway that you can rise above 
And when the end is near who is gonna volunteer 
To be the last one to die for love 

Tolerance or violence and the whole world go to war 
Is one enough or is one too many 
Before we say, ""No More"" 
No more, no more, no more, no more",Tolerance,2005
Michael Franti,"A revolution never come with a warning
A revolution never sends you an omen
A revolution just arrived like the morning
Ring the alarm, we come to wake up the snoring

They tellin' you to never worry about the future
They tellin' you to never worry about the torture
They tellin you that you'll never see the horror
Spend it all today and we will bill you tomorrow
Three piece suits and bank accounts in Bahamas
Wall street crime will never send you to the slammer
Tell all the children in the arms of their mommas
The f-15 is a homicide bomber
TV commercials for a popping pill culture
Drug companies circling like a vulture
An Iraqi babies with a G.I. Joe father
Ten years from now is anybody gonna bother

Everyone addicted to the same nicotine
Everyone addicted to the same gasoline
Everyone addicted to a technicolor scream
Everybody trying to get their hands on same green
From the banks of the river to the banks of the greedy
All of the riches taken back by needy
We come from the country and we come from the city
You play us on the record, you can play us on the cd
All the shit you given us is fertilizer
The seeds that we planted you can brutalize them
Tell the corporation you can never globalize you
Like peter tosh said ""legalize it""
Girls and boys hear the bass and treble
Rumble in the speakers and it make you wanna rebel
Throw your hands up, take it to another level
And you can never, ever, ever make a deal with the devil

Anywhere I go cause I was made of this earth
I'm born of this earth,
I breathe of this earth,
And even with the pain I believe in this earth, so
I wake up every mornin' and I'm steppin' on the floor,
I wake up every mornin' and I'm stepping out the door

I got faith in the sky,
Faith in the one,
Faith in the people rockin' underneath the sun
'Cause every bit of land is a holy land and
Every drop of water is a holy water and
Every single child is a son or a daughter of the one
Earth mama and the one Earth papa, so
Don't tell a man that he cant come here cause he got
Brown eyes and a wavy kind of hair, and
Don't tell a woman that she cant go there because she
Prays a little different to a God up there
You say you're a Christian
'Cause God made you
You say you're a Muslim
'Cause god made you
You say you're a Hindu and the next man a Jew
Then we all kill each other

Hey Now Now, I say hey now now
Don't tell the people that they got to go
I wanna keep em 'til the early morn i say
Hey Now Now, I say hey now now

You've been a soldier girl
and I would do anything for you
It's true, it's true
I wanna be in the early morn',
I'm gonna light up the night for you,
It's true, it's true

Run come come comin' a join in this party
The rhythm of the music make me feelin' irie
Hey now it doesn't matter where you comin' from a'
Dancin' to the riddim of the feelin' of the drumma
Choose to do the things that make the people come together
Use the money maker that was given from your mama
Hey now selecta wanna get ya rub a dubba
Come come come til the sun shine on

[Chorus]

Be who you are nothing more nothing less
and let the beauty that you love beÃ¢?Â¦.. the very best
Sing praises to the highest with your feet on the ground
And reach for your brother with the words that you sound and
Don't let mistakes be so monumental, and
Don't let your love be so confidential, and
Don't let your mind be so darn judgmental
And please let your heart be more influential.

Be thankful for all the Spirit provides
And be thankful for all that you can see without eyes
Give thanks to music that keeps us alive
And give thanks to all DJ's worldwide

The music and the harmony, the family and friends
It seems like when your dancin' man, the feelin' never ends
The base of the base, the voice of the drum
The fumble of the keys, my weapon is my tounge
If there's love in the rhythm then the soul is gonna follow
We turnin' up the system, it'll go until tomorrow
If you need some money, I got some that you can borrow
We dance until the sun come up and cast shadows
Right now, the tune reflects, lights out, we soon connect
We ride on lows and high
So hot that we sweat, so happy we cry
Wish bygones goodbye, thank god we's alive
With time on our side and this rhyme I provide
We smile while we slide, do I say goodbye?
We keep it rockin' like the sound of lion

[Chorus]

It's hot, and the police man come
And try to break up the party tonight
uh ha (I say hey now now)
Then I would stand firm wit' you
And would brace ourselves for the fight
All Night, alright I say

Don't tell the DJ got to turn it low
We keep it rockin' til the early morn I say
